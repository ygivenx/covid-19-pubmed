Based on their phylogenetic clustering, CoVs are sorted into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses, of which the Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera encompass six human pathogens identified to date. CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with large genomes of approximately 27\u201332 kb, and their genomic RNA is capped and polyadenylated. The 5\u2019 two-thirds of the CoV genome encode a polyprotein that is post-translationally processed to yield all proteins required for RNA replication (non-structural proteins), whereas the 3\u2019 one-third of the genome encodes a canonical set of four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. The S glycoprotein of CoV belongs to class I viral fusion proteins and facilitates virus-receptor interactions. The envelope and membrane proteins form the virion shell, while the nucleocapsid protein interacts with viral RNA to form the virus core. Some species belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus encode an additional structural protein, hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which is thought to act as a receptor-degrading enzyme or mediates interaction with co-receptors, depending on the species [1].",

However, the virus disappeared before summer 2003 and never returned in its highly virulent form [2, 3]. The second, most recently isolated CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes pneumonia and renal failure, with a mortality rate exceeding 30% [4, 5]. The remaining four low-pathogenic (LP) HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 (Alphacoronaviruses), HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 (Betacoronaviruses), have been shown to circulate worldwide. Although infection with these viruses results primarily in the common cold in otherwise healthy adults, they may cause severe disease in young, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals [6\u20139].",

We previously proposed that the cationically modified chitosan, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and its hydrophobically-modified derivative (HM-HTCC) are potent inhibitors of HCoV-NL63 [10]. These polymeric compounds were able to impede replication of the virus in vitro in the permissive cell line LLC-MK2, as well as in an ex vivo model of fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) primary cultures. Furthermore, these polymers were shown to inhibit murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in culture, suggesting that these chitosan-based compounds may represent a novel type of broad-spectrum inhibitors [10].",

            "text": "Here, we dissected the mechanism of the HTCC antiviral activity using functional assays, molecular methods, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. A thorough analysis of the HTCC activity proved that the polymer interacts with the S protein of HCoV-NL63 and blocks its interaction with the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) protein. Furthermore, we show that HTCC with different degrees of substitution (DSs) is to be a potent inhibitor of all four LP-HCoVs. DSs are expressed as the fraction of NH2 groups substituted within the chitosan chain. The DS of the studied HTCC polymers varied between 57% and 77%; thus the polymers were named HTCC-57, HTCC-62, HTCC-63, HTCC-65 and HTCC-77. The previously described HTCC polymer of a DS of 63% (here marked as HTCC-63) demonstrated an inhibitory effect not only on HCoV-NL63, but also on HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Interestingly, two different HTCCs, HTCC-62 and HTCC-77, proved to be effective inhibitors of HCoV-229E infection. Further, HTCC-65 effectively inhibited replication of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43, while HTCC-62 showed strong antiviral effect on HCoV-HKU1 infection. Taken together, the current analysis demonstrates that the combination of these cationically modified chitosan-based polymeric compounds into a single formulation may act as an effective broad-range anticoronaviral agent for the treatment of coronaviral infections.",

At this temperature virus can bind to the receptor, while virus internalization is suppressed due to intracellular trafficking inhibition. Next, HCoV-NL63 cell surface adhesion was evaluated using flow cytometry. The virus adherence was not inhibited in the presence of HTCC-63, suggesting that the polymer does not hamper virus binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPs) (Fig 1) [13]. Surprisingly, the adherence of HCoV-NL63 particles seemed to be enhanced in the presence of HTCC. One may assume that HCoV-NL63 virions cluster in the presence of HTCC, as they bind to the polymer via the S protein forming aggregates. To support these data, another assay was performed, where LLC-Mk2 cells were pre-cooled and incubated with HCoV-NL63 (TCID50 of 400) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of HTCC-63 (200 \u03bcg/ml) or control PBS.

As naturally susceptible LLC-Mk2 cells express only low levels of the ACE2 protein, we used previously described A549 cells with directed ACE2 expression (A549_ACE2+) [13].

Obtained results demonstrated that in the control samples virions co-localize with the ACE2 protein, while in the presence of the polymer this interaction is abolished (Fig 2). This result is consistent with our previous observations that HTCC-63 binds to the S protein of HCoV-NL63 [10].",

Subsequently, the media were removed and cells were washed 3 times with acidic buffer (0.1 M glycine, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 3.0) in order to inhibit the fusogenic activity of virions that were not internalized [15\u201317].

Unfortunately, titration of this virus was not possible due to the lack of appropriate in vitro culture models. Analysis revealed that all of the studied HTCC polymers affected HCoV-HKU1 infection, with HTCC-62 and HTCC-77 being the most effective. At 72\u2013120 h p.i., a 3\u20134 log decrease in the HCoV-HKU1 yield was observed in samples supplemented with HTCC-62 or HTCC-77 compared to the control (Fig 5A).",

However, the HTCC antiviral activity against different pathogens varied depending on the percentage of amine groups substituted with ammonium groups in the polymer chain, i.e., the DS of the polymer. For example, HCoV-NL63 infection was effectively inhibited by HTCC-63 and HTCC-65, whereas HCoV-229E replication was significantly reduced by HTCC-62 and HTCC-77. To analyze whether these two pathogens could be inhibited using a single HTCC preparation, we tested the inhibitory effect of HTCC-62/63 and HTCC-63/77 mixtures on HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E infection. The results of in vitro study using LLC-Mk2 and MRC-5 cell lines demonstrated a significant decrease (an approximate 4 log reduction compared to the control sample) in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E virus yields in the presence of HTCC-62/63 or HTCC-63/77 mixtures (1:1 w/w) (Fig 6).",

Similarly, HTCC-63 hampered replication of three evolutionarily distinct viruses: HCoV-NL63, an Alphacoronavirus, and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, which belong to the Betacoronavirus genus.

Interestingly, using HCoV-NL63 as the model system we determined that HTCC polymer blocks the interaction between the S protein and the cellular receptor, consequently hampering virus infection. The fact that polymers with different substitution levels are active against different CoVs suggest that these compounds interact with the S protein of different viruses, and may be optimized to be active also against other species. Thus, HTCCs hold great promise as anticoronaviral agents for use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Importantly, chitosan and chitosan-based polymers are not toxic in vivo, as shown by Yeh et al [28]. Further, Zeng et al demonstrated that HTCC is rapidly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract. The polymer was mainly distributed to lung, heart and kidney, whereas 24 hours later it was fully eliminated. These properties make HTCC a very promising compound for the use in clinic [29].",
