Despite the widespread use of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, the emergence of antigenic variants and the influence of maternal antibodies have contributed to questioning the efficacy of commercial vaccines [6,7]. In addition, there are no suitable antiviral drugs available for specific treatment of CPV infections. Therefore, the only treatment options for the infection are supportive and symptom-based care [11,12,13]. Thus, it is important to obtain antiviral drugs for potential therapeutic use in canine parvoviral diarrhea.",

Firstly, 86 \u03bcL of F81 cells (2.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were pretreated with 4 \u03bcL of each stock solution to obtain a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM for 1 h, then the drug-treated F81 cells were infected with 10 \u03bcL CPV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.076. Normal and the CPV SD6-infected F81 cells containing a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Cell viability was examined by TransDetect\u00ae Cell Counting Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) at 40 h postinfection. Optical density (OD) at 450 nm wavelength was collected using a SYNERGY H1 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). OD450 values of wells without CPV infection served as a positive (cell) control indicating 100% CPE inhibition, and OD450 values of wells with SD6 infection served as a negative (virus) control indicating 0% CPE inhibition [14]. The percentage inhibition was calculated using the formula: percentage CPE inhibition = (OD450 of drug treated cells \u2212 OD450 of negative control)/(OD450 of positive control \u2212 OD450 of negative control) \u00d7 100 [20,21]. All drug plates were set-up in duplicates for primary screening, and drugs show greater than 20% CPE inhibition from the primary screen were used for second round of screening. The further validation of identified drugs was conducted in triplicates, and drugs show greater than 50% CPE inhibition were used for further analysis.",

The obtained fragment was cloned into pMD\u00ae18-T (Takara, Shiga, Japan), and the resulting positive clone was named pMD-VP2S for further use. To evaluate the antiviral effects of the three drugs of Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium and Closantel, F81 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 7.5 \u00d7 105 cells per well and pretreated with the 3 drugs at a final concentrations of 5 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, and 20 \u03bcM, respectively, for 1 h, then treated cells were infected with CPV at MOI of 0.076 as described above. Cells treated with 0.1% DMSO were used as control. After 40 h incubation, total DNA was extracted from whole cell lysates by QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The quantitative standard curve was generated via quantitative real-time PCR of the plasmid pMD-VP2S preparations at serial dilutions of 106, 105, 104, 103, 102, and 10 copies/\u03bcL. Each 20 \u03bcL qPCR reaction mixture contained 1 \u03bcL 10-fold diluted sample, 10 \u03bcL SuperReal PreMix Plus (SYBR Green) (TianGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and 0.2 \u03bcM of specific primers. All mixtures were then loaded into a StepOne Plus qPCR machine (Applied Biosystems, USA). The qPCR procedure was of 3 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of 5 s at 95 \u00b0C, and 30 s at 60 \u00b0C. The absolute number of DNA copies of the VP2 gene in the cells was determined according to the generated standard curve.",

In order to evaluate whether drug-associated apoptosis was involved in the antiviral effect, we measured the caspase-3 activity of drug-treated cells with or without CPV infection. As shown in Figure 7, the antiapoptotic effects were observed within 12 h in Nitazoxanide-treated F81 cells with or without CPV infection. Therefore, Nitazoxanide-associated caspase activation reduction (apoptosis) might be involved in the antiviral effect of the drug. Closantel Sodium- or Closantel-treated cells had no pro- or antiapoptotic effects (Figure S2); hence, the antiviral effects of these two drugs may not be due to drug-associated apoptosis.",

In this study, we developed a CPE-based assay to screen CPV inhibitors from a FDA-approved drug library, and successfully identified three FDA-approved CPV inhibitors.

After screening, the top three drugs, Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel, with higher percentage CPE inhibition, were selected and further confirmed by qPCR and IFA. In addition, the identified drugs can inhibit different subspecies of CPV variants and displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against CPV. Hence, these drugs may provide potential options for the treatment of CPV infection.",
