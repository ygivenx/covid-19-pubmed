This is likely due to the low abundance of DRiPs relative to the abundance of folded proteins, which poses a significant challenge to current biochemical/molecular technologies. A central question is what mechanisms dominate in the production of DRiPs [5], [6]. One set of mechanisms that leads to the generation of partial protein products is downstream initiation and premature terminations when translating proteins from mRNAs [7]. If such errors are involved in generation of DRiPs, a bias in sampling of regions of mRNAs may result. This sampling bias in turn may influence from which regions of proteins epitopes are more often detected, resulting in positional bias of epitopes. For example, a dominance of downstream initiation would result in more epitopes detected from the C-terminal ends; conversely, a dominance of premature termination would result in more epitopes detected from the N-terminal regions.",

Its overlay with the probability ratios curve observed earlier (i.e. \nFig. 1C\n) is shown in \nFig. 4D\n. Overall, the probability ratios curve estimated only from the conservation data has a good agreement with the observed one (Pearson's correlation r = 0.57). In addition, for first, second and fourth bins, their confidence intervals between observed positional bias curve and that derived from conservation overlap. Thus, the observed positional bias in viral epitopes can be explained by the correlation between conservation and immune recognition alone, consistent with a minor contribution from premature translational termination and downstream initiation.",

This could be explained by near equal participation of downstream initiation and premature termination mechanisms in generating DRiPs as a major source of epitopes. Our findings, however, point to the conclusion that the central bias of viral epitopes reflects the combined effects of positional bias of epitope sequence conservation and induction of memory CD8+ T cells by exposure to heterologous boosts.

The principle idea behind boosting is that those epitopes already exposed to the immune system tend to dominate in the following exposure [16]. This repeated exposure is a likely explanation of why MHC-I restricted viral epitopes tend to be more conserved than non-epitopes. Providing an additional support to this explanation, Kim et al. presented results showing positive correlation between epitope conservation and T-cell response frequency scores, which indicate how often individuals recognize a given peptide from a pathogen [17]. Presumably, this correlation is due to higher likelihood of more conserved epitopes being seen by greater number of individuals.

In explaining differential conservations between positive and negative peptides, it may be that this is due to viruses selectively mutating T-cell epitopes [19]\u2013[21].

For each peptide:antigen mapping, a normalized position was calculated. The set of normalized positions was plotted as a histogram.
