Pigs that are infected with TGEV usually present symptoms such as vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea. Among the piglets aged less than 2 weeks old, the mortality rate of TGEV infection is as high as 100% [1, 2]. Globally, TGE causes enormous economic loss to the swine industry. TGEV was first identified in the United States in 1946 as an etiological agent of TGE in swine [3]. TGEV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 28.6 kb. The virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales [4]. The virus genome comprises 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), at least nine open reading frames,and 3\u2032-UTR [4]. ORF1 comprises two ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, respectively. The polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-Nsp16) by the virus-encoded papain-like protease (PL pro) and 3C-like protease (3CL pro). These non-structural proteins have various functions in the viral life cycle [5].",

Various transcription factors, such as interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) are activated during the immune response [6\u20138]. Among these transcription factors, NF-\u03baB is the key regulator of the proinflammatory and antiviral responses. The NF-\u03baB family comprises of five members: p65/RelA, RelB, cRel, p50, and p52. These transcription factors share an N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain, which is known as the Rel homology domain. This domain plays a crucial role in the formation of homodimers and heterodimers. NF-\u03baB dimers can bind to various target DNA sequences called \u03baB sites and modulate the gene expression [9]. The canonical pathway for the activation of NF-\u03baB has been extensively studied. The pathogen pattern recognition receptor on the cell surface recognizes various pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathogen molecules, resulting in the activation of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, which is mediated by the IKK\u03b2 subunit. The phosphorylated IKK\u03b2 subunit phosphorylates the amino terminus of repressor I\u03baB (mainly I\u03baB\u03b1) at the Ser32 and Ser36 residues. Subsequently, repressor I\u03baB is ubiquitinated and targeted for protein degradation by the proteolytic enzymes. The degradation of I\u03baB exposes the nuclear localization signal (NLS), which promotes the translocation of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. NF-\u03baB within the nucleus promotes the transcription of several chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion factors [9, 10].",

            "text": "Many viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are known to activate the host innate immune response through NF-\u03baB activation [11\u201314]. However, the virus particles may still replicate and cause disease in vivo. This suggests that the virus employs various strategies to inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway for evading the host immune response. The Orf virus (ORFV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) can evade the antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB activation [15\u201318]. Additionally, some viruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), have a dual role in the regulation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [19, 20]. As both PEDV and TGEV belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae, we explored whether the effect of TGEV on NF-\u03baB signaling is similar to that of PEDV. Our previous experimental results have demonstrated that TGEV infection can activate the NF-\u03baB and induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [21], which concurred with the results of other studies [22]. However, whether TGEV exerts an inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is still unknown.",

Additionally, we demonstrated that Nsp3 was the key viral protein that is involved in the regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling through the canonical pathway and in the suppression of NF-\u03baB-induced cytokine production. The amino acids at positions 590\u20131,215 in Nsp3 play a critical role in the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling by inhibiting I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65.

Poly(I:C) activates NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and induces cytokine production [23]. The antiviral effect of poly(I:C) against TGEV was evaluated by treating the IPEC-J2 cells with poly(I:C) for 12 h before inoculation with the TGEV. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that poly(I:C) can significantly reduce the TGEV RNA replication, whereas its effect on cell viability was minimal (Fig. 1a). Although poly(I:C) inhibited TGEV replication in the cells, the virus could not be completely inactivated. Hence, we hypothesized that TGEV may evade the host immune system by inhibiting the poly(I:C)-activated NF-\u03baB pathway. We co-transfected ST and IPEC-J2 cells with the pNF-\u03baB-Luc reporter plasmid to evaluate the effect of TGEV replication on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. The pRL-TK plasmid was used as an internal reference. At 12 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with poly(I:C) to induce the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The infected cells were harvested for dual luciferase activity analysis at different time points. We observed that the poly(I:C)-treated group exhibited significant activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway when compared to the mock control group. However, TGEV infection resulted in time-dependent inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling activation (Fig. 1b). The transfected ST and IPEC-J2 cells were treated with poly(I:C) and infected with TGEV at different MOIs to evaluate the effect of viral infection titers on the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 1c, NF-\u03baB signaling was significantly activated in the poly(I:C)-treated group when compared to the control group. TGEV infection resulted in significant dose-dependent inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway activation.",

Moreover, the deubiquitination effect of Nsp3 and Nsp3 (590\u20131,215 aa) was significantly higher than that of Nsp3 (1\u2013418 aa) in both HEK-293 T and IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 7a). The effect of Nsp3 (590\u20131,215 aa) transfection on I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination was evaluated by transfecting the Nsp3 (590\u20131,215 aa) and pCMV-HA-Ub eukaryotic expression plasmids into the IPEC-J2 and HEK-293 T cells. The cell extracts were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 7b, Nsp3 (590\u20131,215 aa) transfection decreased the I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination levels. These results indicate that Nsp3 can induce deubiquitination and that the amino acids at positions 590\u20131,215 in Nsp3 may inhibit the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by decreasing the I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination levels, which results in the suppression of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

A variety of viruses evade the host immune response by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

Previous studies have demonstrated that NF-\u03baB is essential in priming inflammasome activation for the production of cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 [31, 32]. Several viral proteins play an important role in the regulation of inflammation via NF-\u03baB signaling. The HBeAg protein of HBV suppresses the lipopolysaccharide-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1b production via the inhibition of NF-\u03baB phosphorylation [33]. Similarly, BVDV infection was reported to trigger NF-\u03baB signaling and enhance IL-8 transcription, as the transcription level was observed to be markedly increased after the viral infection, and the immediate early response 3 (IER3) was also reported to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity and downregulate IL-8 expression by approximately 65% [34]. Our experimental results indicated that Nsp3 can downregulate the expression of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 through the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

Nsp3 was truncated into four fragments without affecting its original functional domain, and the truncated genes were screened with a dual luciferase assay. The two truncated gene fragments, Nsp3 (1\u2013418 aa) and Nsp3 (590\u20131,215 aa) strongly inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, with the inhibitory effect of Nsp3 (590\u20131,215 aa) being significantly higher than that of Nsp3 (1\u2013418 aa). The SMART database predicted that both Nsp3 (1\u2013418 aa) and Nsp3 (590\u20131,215 aa) contain PLPs (154\u2013406 and 606\u2013901 aa). PLPs exhibit deubiquitinating activity, removing the ubiquitin moiety from the signaling molecule in the innate antiviral pathway to inhibit the host innate immunity [26, 35, 36]. Coronavirus PLPs are reported to be the suppressors of innate immune response. SARS-CoV PLP inhibits IFN induction and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways by regulating the activation of important signaling proteins in the IRF3 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways [37]. Similarly, HCoV-NL63 uses PLPs to evade the innate antiviral response of the host through the inhibition of p53-IRF7-IFN\u03b2 signaling [38]. We hypothesized that Nsp3 may utilize the deubiquitination effects of PLP to inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by suppressing I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination. Our results demonstrated that Nsp3 (590\u20131,215 aa) had markedly deubiquitination activity in the HEK-293 T and IPEC-J2 cells, so Nsp3(590\u20131,215aa) was used to verify our hypothesis. Consistent with our expected, the amino acid residues at positions 590\u20131,215 of Nsp3 can inhibit the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by reducing its ubiquitination level. This phenomenon is likely associated with the deubiquitinating enzyme activity of PLP2, which exists within Nsp3 amino acid residues 606\u2013901.",
