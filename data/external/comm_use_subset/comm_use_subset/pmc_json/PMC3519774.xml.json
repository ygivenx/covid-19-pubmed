Specialists are expected to have reduced fitness in heterogeneous environments whereas the fitness of generalists in homogeneous environments is expected to be below that of a specialist. Such fitness trade-offs may be caused by antagonistic pleiotropy, in which a beneficial mutation in one environment is either harmful or neutral in another environment, or mutations that are neutral in the environment in which they arose are deleterious in another [3], [5], [8]. Specialists are thought to evolve more rapidly than generalists because selection for beneficial traits and against harmful traits is expected to occur more rapidly in homogeneous environments [1], [10].",

Some viruses are described as specialists if they infect one or only a few closely related host species whereas others are viewed as generalists if they infect multiple hosts including species from different taxonomic groups [11]\u2013[15]. On a finer scale, a generalist multi-host virus is likely to exist as several distinct genetic strains that circulate in overlapping but distinct ranges of host species [16]\u2013[19]. Should particular strains of a multi-host virus evolve in one (of several possible) host species, they are expected to experience strong co-evolution and thus become specialist strains with increased fitness in the host to which they are adapted. Strains of the same multi-host virus that evolve in heterogeneous host environments composed of several species would experience weaker co-evolution and become generalist strains [5], [7], [8], [11], [13]. The fitness of generalist strains should be higher than that of specialist strains in all host species except for the particular species that specialist strains were adapted to. Thus, specialist and generalist strains of a multi-host virus are expected to show trade-offs in their relative fitness in different host environments.",

Between 55 and 60 million years ago this order diverged into two suborders, the Feliformia and Caniformia [28]. Outbreaks of CDV have occurred in species within both the Caniformia, such as the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) and Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica), and Feliformia, such as the African lion (Panthera leo) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) [29]\u2013[33]. Sensitivity to CDV varies greatly, even among species within one family. For example, in the Felidae, domestic cats (Felis catus) exposed to CDV seroconvert but do not develop clinical disease [34], [35], whereas large felids both seroconvert and develop clinical disease [29], [31].",

            "text": "CDV encodes two envelope glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (CDV-H) protein which mediates virus binding to the target host cell receptor, and the fusion (CDV-F) protein which accomplishes membrane fusion, thereby enabling entry of the viral replication complex into the cytoplasm [36]. Interestingly, the CDV-H protein is the most variable H protein among all members of the genus Morbillivirus, which may explain why CDV has a far broader host range than other morbilliviruses [37]. In cultured cells, infection frequently leads to the formation of multinucleated cells known as syncytia. The proficiency of syncytium formation is chiefly determined by the CDV-H protein [38]. Currently, the only described [39] cellular receptor for the CDV-H protein on host lymphatic cells is the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM, CD150). In humans it is expressed on immature thymocytes, memory T cells, and a subset of B cells and is rapidly induced in a wide range of immune cells after activation [40]\u2013[42]. The importance of SLAM binding for CDV pathogenesis was experimentally demonstrated [43]. Measles virus (another Morbillivirus) also binds to SLAM, CD150 [40]\u2013[42] and some strains are known to bind to cell receptor CD46 in both epithelial and immune cells [44]. Although it is unlikely that the CDV-H protein binds to CD46 [43], other as yet unidentified receptors are thought to exist on lymphatic and epithelial cells [45].",

Recently it was proposed that the specificity of the CDV-H protein-SLAM receptor interaction represents a potential determinant of the host range [46]\u2013[48]. In particular, it was hypothesized that strong positive selection at site 549 in the SLAM binding region of the CDV-H protein associated with the substitution of tyrosine (Y) by histidine (H) at this site changed CDV-H protein structure leading to the spread of CDV from domestic dogs to non-dog species [46]. Current information on the amino acid at site 549 in CDV strains worldwide suggests that positive selection at site 549 may be driven by adaptation of strains to their host species, given that the vast majority of domestic dog strains (and strains from other species in the Canidae family) have Y at this site, whereas strains from species in other carnivore families mostly have H at this site [49].",

This idea is plausible, given the presence of genetically distinct wildlife lineages of CDV, most notably in non-canid species in Europe [49], [52], [53] and genetic differences between CDV strains in domestic dogs and wild carnivores in relation to the residue at site 549 in the CDV-H protein [46], [49], but to our knowledge has not been tested.",

We then tested the predicted expression of specialist traits and generalist traits (detailed in Table 1) both at syncytia formation and virus production using two in vitro assays. The syncytia formation assay measured a parameter relevant to cell entry, i.e., the mean number of nuclei per syncytium formed by CDV-H proteins from domestic dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing SLAM from the domestic dog, SLAM from the African lion and SLAM from the domestic cat. The virus titer assay measured virus production post cell entry by the same CDV strains in cells expressing SLAM from the same three carnivore species. Both assays provided results consistent with the predicted expression of specialist traits by CDV-H proteins and strains from domestic dog in cells expressing domestic dog SLAM and generalist traits by CDV-H proteins and strains from non-dog hosts regardless of which species SLAM was expressed on cells. Finally, we investigated antagonistic pleiotropic effects of the residue at site 549 in the CDV-H protein in different host receptor environments. We predicted that experimental substitution of residue Y, characteristic of domestic dog CDV strains at site 549, with residue H, typical for CDV strains from non-dog hosts [46], [49], in the CDV-H protein from one domestic dog strain would decrease expression of specialist traits in the syncytia formation assay, which is what our results showed.",

In support of this idea our analysis of SLAM amino acid sequences from carnivores revealed a high similarity (99%) between sequences from three species in the Canidae, and the predicted far lower similarities (72.9\u201385.2%) between these canid SLAM sequences and SLAM sequences from six species in other carnivore families (Felidae, Hyenidae, Mustelidae and Phocidae figure 1a). Results from the syncytia formation assay provided in vitro evidence consistent with the predicted expression of specialist or generalist traits by CDV-H proteins from CDV strains of domestic dogs and non-dog species, respectively (Table 1). Results from the virus titer assay which measured trait expression post cell entry were also mostly consistent with these predictions. Finally, the expected decline in the expression of specialist traits and the increase in the expression of generalist traits by the mutant CDV-H protein (A75/17-549H) in which residue H typical of non-dog strains at site 549 replaced residue Y, characteristic of domestic dog strains such as the parent strains A75/17, provided evidence of antagonistic pleiotropy, and the involvement of the residue (Y or H) at site 549 [46], [49] as one possible factor influencing CDV host-species range.",

This hypothesis, within the evolutionary framework of specialists and generalists, suggests that the experimental substitution Y549H in a domestic dog strain would create a mutant expected to express traits more similar to generalist non-dog strains than the specialist traits of dog strains. Our results conformed to this expectation as the mutant CDV-H protein from strain A75/17-549H performed significantly less well than the CDV-H protein of the parent domestic dog strain (A75/17) in cells expressing SLAM from domestic dogs. Also, as predicted, CDV-H protein of the mutant strain (A75/17-549H) performed significantly better than the CDV-H protein from the parent virus in cell lines expressing lion SLAM or domestic cat SLAM. Thus, the residue substitution Y549H caused a significant decline in the expression of specialist traits and an increase in the expression of generalist traits. These results are consistent with the idea that specialist traits that emerge from strong co-evolution in a homogeneous environment entail the cost of reduced fitness in the heterogeneous environments, and that this trade-off is a result of antagonistic pleiotropy [3], [5], [8].",

There are many disease models that consider how infection by one strain of a pathogen alters host reaction to another [58]\u2013[63]. These models mostly consider cross- immunity between strains and antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Our results suggest that one key level of complexity hitherto ignored in models of CDV in multi-host carnivore communities is the incorporation of the effect of strains that differ in their fitness in specific host species. Traditionally, CDV infections in wildlife were assumed to result from spill-over infection from domestic dogs. The results of our phylogenetic analysis suggest that spill-over of domestic dog strains to other species within the family Canidae is more likely than to non-canid species.",

Strain Dog94SE was isolated from a domestic dog close to the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, in 1994, the Lion94SNP isolate was obtained from a lion during a CDV outbreak in wildlife in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, in 1994. As these two strains were obtained in the same year and within the same geographical area of Tanzania, from a domestic dog and non-dog host, they are well suited to test for specialist and generalist traits, as the null hypothesis would predict CDV strains from the same geographical area and time-frame should perform equally in our assays. These two CDV isolates from Tanzania were initially isolated in dog PBMCs in 1994 and then were kept at \u221280\u00b0C until this study. Strain A75/17 was recovered from a domestic dog [64] and maintained by passaging it on VeroDogSLAM cells.

Furthermore, to ensure that the CDV-F protein did not influence the extent of syncytia formation measured by the assay, different CDV-F proteins were combined with CDV-H proteins used in this study. No differences were observed in the MNN per syncytia when we expressed different CDV-F proteins with the same CDV-H protein (figure S4). This is consistent with previous reports according to which the size of syncytia formation mainly depended on the CDV-H protein and its ability to bind its cognate receptor, and is not significantly affected when CDV-F proteins from different strains or even different morbilliviruses are applied [38], [45], [68].",

The NMM has the advantage of not making any assumptions about data distribution, only uses the empirical distribution of the data and can be used to analyze factorial experiments of arbitrary complexity (corresponding to general linear models or GLMs).

We also used the NMM to calculate relative marginal effects to provide a graphical representation of the effect size when changing between factor categories. A relative marginal effect of 0.5 for a given factor category indicates that it is equivalent to the mean. If the effect is lower than 0.5, then the values for that category tend to take on smaller values than the results for all factor categories. The smaller the relative marginal effect, the stronger is the tendency to smaller values with respect to the average distribution. If the effect is larger than 0.5, then the values for that factor category tend to take on larger values than the results for all factor categories.
