The nodavirus genome consists of two 5' capped and 3' non-polyadenylated single stranded positive sense RNA segments. The RNA1 segment, typically ~3 kb to 3.4 kb, encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that is essential for viral transcription and replication. In addition, there is a subgenomic transcript derived from the RNA1 segment, which encodes both the B1 protein within the same frame and the B2 protein in the +1 frame relative to the polymerase. The nodavirus B2 protein is a functional viral suppressor of RNA silencing (Chao et al., 2005), while the function of the B1 protein remains unknown. The RNA2, ~1.4 kb, encodes the viral capsid protein (alpha) which is subsequently cleaved into beta and gamma peptides during virus maturation in at least a subset of the nodaviruses. The most widely studied nodavirus is Flock house virus (FHV), which can infect a wide range of host cells, including mammalian, insect, plant, and yeast cells (Johnson and Ball, 1997; Lu et al., 2005; Price et al., 1996; Selling et al., 1990; Venter and Schneemann, 2008).",

Most strikingly, these three viruses have much larger RNA2 segments than the nodaviruses.

            "text": "A first step towards evaluating the potential function of the delta ORF would be to establish whether it is in fact expressed in vivo. In the absence of a subgenomic transcript, non-5'-proximal ORFs in RNA viruses are commonly expressed via ribosomal frameshifting, a mechanism whereby specific signals \u2013 usually in the mRNA \u2013 stimulate a proportion of ribosomes to change reading frame, most commonly in the \u22121 direction, and continue translating an alternative ORF to produce a \u2018transframe\u2019 fusion protein (Firth and Brierley, 2012). Ribosomal \u22121 frameshifting was first identified in Rous sarcoma virus (Jacks et al., 1988), and later found to be utilized by many viruses \u2013 including retroviruses, astroviruses and coronaviruses \u2013 for polymerase expression (Brierley, 1995). Moreover, a few viruses use ribosomal frameshifting to append an extension domain onto a proportion of their capsid proteins (van der Wilk et al., 1997). The eukaryotic \u22121 ribosomal frameshift site typically consists of a \u2018slippery\u2019 heptanucleotide sequence fitting the consensus motif X_XXY_YYZ, where XXX normally represents any three identical nucleotides (though certain exceptions have been found, such as GUU and GGA); YYY represents AAA or UUU; Z represents A, C or U; and underscores separate codons in the original reading frame. This consensus motif is generally followed by a stimulatory element comprising a stable RNA secondary structure such as a pseudo-knot or stem-loop, beginning 5\u20139 nt downstream of the shift site.",

            "text": "In the initial publication describing the discovery of Orsay and Santeuil viruses, we reported partial sequences of the RNA1 and RNA2 segments of Orsay virus (GenBank: HM030970.1, HM030971.1) (Felix et al., 2011). Here, we sequenced the complete genome of Orsay virus using a combination of 5' and 3' RACE to define the segment termini. The complete RNA1 segment was 3421 nt while the RNA2 segment was 2574 nt. Standard gene prediction using AUG as a start codon suggested that the RNA2 encodes a putative capsid protein (nt 500 to 1261; ~28 kDa) and the previously described delta ORF (nt 1345\u20132385;~38 kDa). Curiously, the Orsay capsid annotation yielded a protein much smaller than that predicted for Santeuil and Le Blanc viruses, and resulted in a very long predicted 5' UTR. To confirm that there were no sequencing errors leading to misannotation, we repeated 10 independent RT-PCR reactions of the Orsay RNA2 5' end, all of which were consistent with the initial sequence. While there were no other AUG codons in frame with the capsid ORF present in the 5' end of RNA2, the capsid ORF could be extended up to 156 codons in the 5' direction if initiation were to occur at a non-AUG codon (Firth and Brierley, 2012). Such a non-AUG initiated ORF could encode a protein with a molecular size of up to ~45 kDa. Moreover, alignment of the N-terminally extended Orsay virus capsid sequence with the corresponding sequences of Le Blanc and Santeuil viruses demonstrated extensive sequence conservation in the region 5' to the first in-frame AUG codon in all three viruses (Fig. 1B), raising the possibility that all three viruses may utilize non-AUG initiation to express their capsid proteins.",

            "text": "In order to detect the viral proteins translated from the RNA2 segment, we generated polyclonal antibodies raised against synthesized peptides from the capsid and the putative delta protein (Fig. 1A). Both capsid and delta peptide derived antibodies specifically bound proteins in Orsay virus infected C. elegans as compared to mock infected C. elegans (Fig. 2A). The anti-capsid antibody detected a band with a molecular size higher than 37 kDa compared to the protein molecular size marker. This band migrated more slowly than expected for the capsid protein based on its theoretical size, ~28 kDa, if translation initiated at the first in-frame AUG codon, but was potentially consistent with translation initiation at an upstream (i.e. non-AUG) codon (up to 45 kDa). In addition, a second band migrating between 75 kDa and 100 kDa was detected in the infected C. elegans with capsid peptide derived antibodies, but not in the mock infected C. elegans. With the anti-delta derived antibody, no protein band that matched the theoretical translational size of the delta ORF (~38 kDa if AUG-initiated) was detected. Instead, a single band migrating between 75 kDa and 100 kDa was clearly detected in the infected C. elegans lysates. These observations raised the possibility that the two antibodies may be detecting a common protein derived from the RNA2 segment. One plausible mechanism that could generate such a protein is ribosomal frameshifting. Analysis of the Orsay virus RNA2 segment demonstrated the presence of a putative heptameric slippery sequence, G_UCA_AAC (underscores separate alpha-frame codons), immediately before the alpha ORF stop codon (Fig. 2B). Although G_UCA_AAC is not normally regarded as a canonical shift site for \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting, it has in fact been tested in reporter constructs and found to be an efficient shift site (Brierley et al., 1992). Further, we identified by RNA secondary structure modeling with Mfold a putative RNA stem loop structure beginning eight nucleotides downstream of the slippery sequence, consistent with a canonical eukaryotic \u22121 frameshift cassette (Fig. 2C). Nucleotide sequence alignment of all three nematode viruses demonstrated conservation of the slippery sequence and the stem loop structure (Fig. 2B). Notably, we found that Le Blanc virus has the same slippery sequence as that of Orsay virus, while Santeuil virus has a different shift-prone sequence G_GAA_AAC (Brierley et al., 1992). Although the predicted RNA stem-loop structure has a 2-nt internal symmetric bulge (Fig. 2C), its base is stabilized by three consecutive G\u2013C base-pairings, and its functional significance is supported by compensatory substitutions (i.e. paired substitutions that preserve the predicted base-pairings), U\u2013A to C\u2013G (lower part of stem, Le Blanc virus) and C\u2013G to U\u2013A (upper part of stem, Santeuil virus). While in some cases of \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting the stimulatory element comprises a simple 3'-adjacent RNA stem-loop structure, in many other cases a pseudoknot is involved. In this case, however, analysis with pknotsRG (Reeder et al., 2007) yielded no evidence for a pseudoknot to form in the appropriate location. Collectively, these data suggested that the nematode viruses may utilize a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism to generate a fusion protein of the alpha and delta ORFs with an estimated molecular size of ~85 kDa (Fig. 2D).",

We could clearly detect the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein band in the highly purified fraction by both Western blot and coomassie staining (Fig 5A). This observation, together with the CsCl density gradient results, demonstrated that the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein is likely assembled into the Orsay virions. There was also an additional faint protein band above the fusion protein band recognized by the anti-capsid antibody, which might reflect post translational modification of the fusion protein. This band was not observed with the anti-capsid antibody in either the infected C. elegans lysates or in the CsCl gradient fractions nor was it detected by the anti-delta antibody in this preparation. Because of the high purity of the iodixanol purified virions, greater quantities of virus were loaded onto the analytical gels than in the previous experiments, which may explain why it was not detected in the other experiments. From this purification, we were able to obtain sufficient quantities of the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein to perform N-terminal sequencing, which yielded the identical N-terminus, NKNNT, as with the capsid protein (Table 2).",

            "text": "One of the key differences between the three recently discovered nematode infecting viruses, Orsay, Le Blanc and Santeuil, and nodaviruses is the larger RNA2 segment size. In the three nematode viruses, they range from 2.5 kb to 3.0 kb while the nodaviruses have only ~1.4 kb RNA2 segments. In the original annotation of the RNA2 segment of the nematode infecting viruses, we identified an ORF encoding a product orthologous to the capsid proteins of nodaviruses in the 5' half of the RNA2 segment. In the 3' half, we identified an ORF of unknown function, the delta ORF. Here we present extensive data demonstrating that the delta ORF is primarily expressed as a fusion with the alpha capsid via ribosomal frameshifting. The alpha\u2013delta fusion was unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry of purified protein through the detection of peptide fragments throughout the fusion protein and critically, the peptide encoded at the ribosomal frameshift site. In two distinct biochemical purification strategies, this fusion protein co-sedimented with the peak virion fractions, demonstrating that it is likely part of the viral particle. Thus, unlike the structures of the FHV virions, which are composed of the alpha capsid protein (cleaved into beta and gamma fragments) (Gallagher and Rueckert, 1988) alone, Orsay virus virions appear to contain a mixture of the traditional alpha capsid protein and the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein. The function of the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein remains unknown. It is possible that it plays a role in receptor binding. By analogy, a C-terminal domain appended to a small proportion of luteovirus capsid proteins via stop codon read-through plays a role in aphid transmission (Brault et al., 1995). The delta domain may also have additional non-structural roles, as have been described for many viral capsid proteins (Ni and Kao, 2013). One possibility is that this protein may play a role in antagonizing antiviral pathways in nematodes.",

Only when large quantities of highly purified virions were analyzed did we detect by Western blot a band that could be consistent with a delta ORF protein alone. However the observed band is more likely to be simply a degradation product of the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein as there is no clear mechanism by which delta could be independently expressed. Furthermore, this band was not detected in the final highly purified iodixonal gradient fractions. A recent study that attempted to evaluate whether the delta ORF alone, when cloned into a heterologous expression vector, can act as a suppressor of RNA silencing, yielded a negative result (Guo and Lu, 2013). However, in light of our data demonstrating that the delta ORF is primarily expressed as a larger fusion with the capsid protein, the potential of the alpha\u2013delta fusion to suppress RNA silencing should be evaluated.",

To address this issue, we experimentally defined the N-terminus of both the capsid protein and the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein of Orsay virus in the context of purified virions. By N-terminal sequencing, NKNNT were defined as the N-terminal amino acids for both proteins. Based on sequence homology, it appears likely that this region is translated as part of the capsid protein in all three nematode viruses (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, such a protein cannot be derived from an AUG translation initiation site. A number of near-cognate non-AUG codons (e.g. CUG) can support some level of initiation, particularly if in a strong initiation context (Firth and Brierley, 2012). One possibility is that an upstream UUG triplet at nucleotide 56\u201358 is used for initiation in Orsay virus, and that a subsequent proteolytic cleavage generates the NKNNT termini found in these proteins in the virion. In the alphanodaviruses, the alpha protein is cleaved into beta and gamma proteins, providing an explicit precedent for such proteolytic cleavage. However the potential for upstream non-AUG initiation at one of the standard near-cognate non-AUG initiation codons (CUG, GUG, UUG, ACG, AUA, AUC, AUU) is not present in Santeuil virus due to an in-frame stop codon just five codons upstream of the sequence encoding NKNNK. Moreover, the UUG codon in Orsay virus lacks a strong initiation context (ggc_UUG_c) (Nakagawa et al., 2008). It is possible therefore that Orsay virus, and by homology Santeuil and Le Blanc viruses, can initiate capsid translation directly at the site of the NKNNT motif via some unknown mechanism, perhaps akin to the initiator-Met-tRNA-independent initiation utilized in the expression of the dicistrovirus capsid polyprotein (Jang and Jan, 2010). The precise mechanism and site of capsid protein initiation will be investigated in future work.",
