Following an incubation period of 6-16 days, patients may develop fever, headache, vomiting, rigor and nausea [1,4]. Subsequently, encephalitic cases develop neurological symptoms including seizure, tremor, photophobia, decreased sensorium, generalized and localized paresis, movement disorder [4,6]. Signs of meningeal irritation such as neck stiffness may be present. These clinical features are not unique to JE, thus, laboratory diagnosis is required to distinguish it from other neurological disorders.",

For example, it has been demonstrated that increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum correlated with cases of severe disease [8]. However, how these biological cytokines and chemokines contribute to the severe disease has not been fully elucidated.

In common with human cases, mice develop relatively similar neurological dysfunction and the pathologic changes in infected mouse brains are similar to those observed in human cases [6,9]. Although extraneural infection frequently does not result in detectable viremia or virus burden in mice, it is believed that initial virus replication occurs in dendritic cells (DCs) such as Langerhans cells at the site of infection, and the infected DCs migrate to draining lymph nodes [6]. Virus then invades the CNS and hosts develop CNS disease, although the mechanism by which the blood\u2013brain-barrier is crossed is not completely understood [12\u201318].",

Flavivirus variants may induce different degrees of pathology, however, the host immune response is likely to be a more critical determinant of clinical outcome [19]. Inflammatory responses mainly contribute to virus clearance and recovery from fatal disease. For example, CD8+ T cells are reported to have an important function in controlling virus infection [20\u201325], although one report showed only a subsidiary contribution of CD8+ T cells in JEV infection [26]. On the other hand, in recent studies it was suggested that immunopathological mechanisms may contribute to the severity of outcome following some encephalitic flavivirus infections [19,27\u201330]. For example, it was reported that CD8+ T cell function enhances pathogenicity during WNV and MVEV infections [29,30]. Furthermore, in Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)-infected mice the inflammatory response was reported to contribute significantly to the fatal outcome [28].",

            "text": "Microglia are the resident macrophages in the brain and are activated in response to a number of different pathological states [31]. Following JEV infection, activated microglia play a significant role in the development of pathology by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [32,33]. Although these pro-inflammatory cytokines have dual roles, acting both as protectors and degenerators of neurons [31], TNF-\u03b1 is believed to be one of the key factors that mediate immunopathology in the CNS during encephalitic flavivirus infection. For example, it was suggested that TNF-\u03b1 directly mediates neuronal apoptosis by the engagement of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), the TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD) and neuronal death contributes to glial activation and subsequent neuroinflammation [31,34,35]. It was also shown that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mediate RANTES gene expression for the recruitment of immune cells and glutamate released by JEV-infected microglia, involves TNF-\u03b1 signaling and contributes to neuronal death [36,37]. On the other hand, other studies have shown that TNF-\u03b1 has a protective role against WNV infections and restricts WNV pathogenesis by promoting trafficking of mononuclear leukocytes into the CNS [38,39]. Furthermore, neuronal TNF-\u03b1 expression during WNV encephalitis may be an adaptive response to diminish CXCL10-induced death [40]. At this stage of our knowledge, therefore, the precise role of the TNF-\u03b1 response in encephalitic flaviviral pathogenesis remains to be clarified.",

It was suggested that IL-10 mediates protection from acute encephalitis and plays a central role in determining the clinical outcome of JEV infection [42]. Insufficient anti-inflammatory cytokine production of IL-4 and IL-10 in the brain is associated with increased tissue pathology [43]. IL-10 displays a neuroprotective function during JEV infection and regulates deleterious effects of proinflammatory cytokines [44]. Furthermore, an experiment using IL-10 KO mice showed that IL-10 signaling plays a negative role in immunity against WNV infection and blockade of IL-10 signaling helps to control viral infection [45]. Thus, the precise role of the IL-10 response following encephalitic flavivirus infection also remains to be resolved.",

This is considered to be a reproducible model of natural human infections following the bite of an infected mosquito or tick and in the past, death was used as an index of pathogenesis [46]. However, it is known that peripheral infections with some strains of encephalitic flaviviruses do not exhibit normal dose response curves based on mortality. Although this was first reported in the 1940\u2019s [47], the reason for these apparent discrepancies were not fully understood. We previously showed that the Oshima strain of TBEV caused dose independent mortality and the fatality rate did not increase more than 50% with increasing virus challenge doses from 102 to 106 plaque forming unit (pfu) [48]. In our study of TBEV, we suggested that the variation of fatal outcome in individual mice appeared to be due to variation in individual host responses [48].",

Corticosterone levels in the serum were also significantly increased in SG mice compared with other groups (Figure S2B). Corticosterone, a major glucocorticoid hormone, is a strong immunosuppressant and is elevated under stress response conditions such as those preceding death [55,56]. Furthermore, severe cases resulting from infection with JaOArS982 exhibited a significant reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ doubly-positive cells in the thymus (Figure S2C). Thymic depletion and body weight loss are the main features of the systemic stress response [55,56]. These observations therefore suggest that SG mice exhibited a severe systemic stress response accompanied by immune suppression.

Following JaOArS982 virus infection, TNF-\u03b1 KO mice exhibited significantly increased mortality rates when compared with WT mice. Although it has been suggested that TNF-/- mice show developmental defects of the humoral immune system including a lack of primary B cell follicles [38,57,58], TNF-\u03b1 KO mice that we used in this study did not show significant depletion in the anti-JEV IgM response (data not shown) or in cytokine expression (Figure S4). In addition, no significant increases of viral propagation were observed in the peripheral and CNS tissues. Interestingly, there were no significant differences of viral load in the CNS between WT and TNF-\u03b1 KO mice. However, high inflammatory responses were observed in the CNS of TNF-\u03b1 KO mice. In particular, perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B and FasL, which are known to be associated with immune-mediated neurodegeneration, were significantly increased in the brains of TNF-\u03b1 KO mice when compared with those of WT mice. These observations suggest that immunopathological effects contribute to the severe neuronal degeneration and fatal disease in TNF-\u03b1 KO mice.",

However, it is important to note that the levels of inflammatory cytokines of TNF-\u03b1 KO mice and the resultant mortality were dramatically higher than those observed in IL-10 KO mice. IL-10 has an immunoregulatory function on various cells in the innate immune system including cytotoxic and helper T cells, NK cells and B cells [59]. IL-10 signaling has a negative role in immunity against WNV infection [45].

Although it was difficult to identify dying and surviving mice before 13 days pi by their clinical signs, JaOArS982-infected mice showed varying levels of Fas and granular exocytosis in the brains at 11 days pi and some of them exhibited similar or higher levels compared with the TNF-\u03b1 KO mice (Figure S3D).

We have also recently discovered that interferon alpha receptor knockout induces dose-dependent mortality following extraneural infection with JaOArS982 (Hayasaka, et al., unpublished results). In addition, we previously reported that late death following TBEV infection appears to be a key feature of dose independent mortality within the encephalitic flaviviruses [48]. In the current study, JaOArS982-infected mice also displayed increased times to death and the variation of acquired immune responses which either showed protective or pathological effects, appeared to be correlated with severe disease.
