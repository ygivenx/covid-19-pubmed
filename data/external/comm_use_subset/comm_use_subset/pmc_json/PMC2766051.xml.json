Mechanisms associated with control of viral growth are dictated by the infected host cell. Astrocytes and microglia are susceptible to perforin-mediated lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes [2], whereas IFN-\u03b3 suppresses viral replication within oligodendrocytes [3]. Although a robust cell-mediated immune response occurs during acute disease, sterilizing immunity is not achieved, resulting in viral persistence [4]. While virus-specific CD8+ T cells are retained within the CNS of persistently infected mice and lytic activity is muted, these cells retain the capacity to secrete IFN-\u03b3 that limits viral replication in oligodendrocytes [3], [5]\u2013[7]. Histological features associated with viral persistence include the development of an immune-mediated demyelinating disease similar to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS), with both T cells and macrophages being important in amplifying disease severity by contributing to myelin damage [8],[9].",

The ELR+ (glutamic acid \u2013 leucine \u2013 arginine) CXC chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 are up-regulated within the brains of JHMV-infected mice [11],[18],[19], yet little is known regarding their biological significance or cellular targets. CXCL1 and CXCL2 are potent chemoattractants for PMNs, binding and signaling through their receptor CXCR2 [20]\u2013[22]. Moreover, PMNs have been shown to enhance CNS inflammation by disrupting blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI) [23],[24], autoimmune demyelination [25], and JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis [26]. In addition, blocking or silencing of CXCR2 signaling mutes inflammation and tissue damage in mouse models in which PMN infiltration is critical to disease initiation, including SCI [23], inflammatory demyelination [25], bacterial infection of the CNS [27], and viral infection or injury to the lung [28]\u2013[32]. With regards to JHMV infection, depletion of PMNs increases mortality due to abrogated BBB permeabilization and subsequent diminished T cell infiltration into the CNS, however the relationship between CXCR2 signaling and PMN migration during viral infection of the CNS has yet to be determined.",

Within the brain, JHMV titers peaked at day 3 p.i. and gradually declined to below the level of detection (\u223c100 PFU/g) by day 15 p.i. (\nFigure 1A\n). Elevated numbers of neutrophils were observed within the blood as early as day 1 p.i. PMN peaked at day 3 p.i, before rapidly returning to sham levels by day 7 p.i. (\nFigure 1C\n). Similarly, neutrophil infiltration into the CNS peaked at day 3 p.i. and subsequently returned to baseline levels by day 7 p.i. (\nFigure 1E\n). The chemokine receptor CXCR2 was expressed on the majority of PMNs within the blood (\nFigure 1D\n) and brain (\nFigure 1F\n), as assessed by flow cytometry. The pattern of neutrophil infiltration into the CNS was unique, as the infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes (CD45high) and macrophages (F4/80+CD45high) steadily increased to day 7 p.i. (\nFigure 1B\n). As the majority of neutrophils were CXCR2-positive, we next determined the expression pattern of chemokine ligands capable of binding and signaling through CXCR2 within the brain during JHMV infection. Expression of transcripts for the ELR-positive chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5, as well as CXCR2, paralleled PMN recruitment into CNS, peaking at day 3 p.i. and returning to baseline levels by day 12 p.i. (\nFigure 2A\n). Immunostaining for CXCL1 and the astrocyte marker GFAP at day 3 p.i. revealed dual-positive cells located within the parenchyma and associated with the microvasculature (\nFigure 2B\n). Staining was concentrated within the hippocampal region of the brain. The majority (>80%) of CXCL1-positive cells were astrocytes, as defined by GFAP staining, although endothelial cells also appeared positive, given the enriched CXCL1 signal intensity surrounding the vessel wall (\nFigure 2B\n). These results are consistent with previous results [11], [33]\u2013[35] that astrocytes, as well as endothelial cells, are capable of producing this CXCR2 ligand. These data indicate that JHMV infection and replication results in regulated expression of ELR+ chemokines and CXCR2 within the CNS that parallels neutrophil mobilization into the blood and migration into the CNS.",

As shown in \nFigure 3A\n, representative FACS dot plots revealed an almost complete absence of PMN accumulation at day 3 p.i. within the CNS of mice treated with anti-CXCR2 blocking antibody. Enumeration of total PMN infiltration to the brain showed a significant reduction compared to mice treated with control serum at days 1 (p<0.05) and 3 p.i. (p<0.01) (\nFigure 3A\n). CXCR2 neutralization also retarded the accumulation of total inflammatory cells (\nFigure 3B\n) and macrophages (\nFigure 3C\n) at day 3 p.i. Further, treatment with CXCR2 antiserum resulted in a significant (p<0.05) reduction of neutrophil numbers within the blood at day 3 p.i. (Figure S1). Importantly, anti-CXCR2 treatment did not induce complement-mediated lysis or neutrophil depletion from bone-marrow (data not shown). Previously, neutrophils have been deemed partly responsible for the permeabilization of the BBB following JHMV infection [19],[26], therefore, we assessed BBB integrity in the brains of mice treated with either anti-CXCR2 or NRS. Indeed, compared to NRS treatment, CXCR2 neutralization significantly (p<0.05) reduced BBB breakdown, as measured by Evans Blue uptake (\nFigure 3D\n). However, BBB permeability in anti-CXCR2 treated mice was not completely eliminated compared to sham \u2013 infected mice (\nFigure 3D\n). Previous studies indicated that MMP-9 expression by PMN is associated with BBB permeabilization in response to JHMV infection [19],[26]. Consistent with reduced numbers of neutrophils in the brains of anti-CXCR2 treated mice, MMP-9 activity was significantly (p<0.001) muted within the brains, whereas detectable levels of enzyme activity were observable within the brains of NRS treated mice (\nFigure 3E & 3F\n). These data indicate that CXCR2 signaling promotes the directed migration of neutrophils from the periphery to the CNS, thus facilitating the degradation of the BBB in response to JHMV infection.",

            "text": "To better assess the functional role of CXCR2 in host defense, JHMV-infected mice were treated with anti-CXCR2 beginning day \u22121 p.i. and continuing throughout acute disease. Mice began to die at day 4 p.i. and 100% of mice treated with anti-CXCR2 were dead by day 11 p.i., while greater than 90% of infected mice treated with control serum survived until day 12 p.i. (\nFigure 4A\n). Anti-CXCR2-treated mice were also unable to control viral replication within the brain, as evidenced by the significantly elevated viral titers at days 7 (p<0.05) and 9 p.i. (p<0.01), compared to mice treated with control serum (\nFigure 4B\n). Sham \u2013 infected mice treated with anti-CXCR2 did not exhibit any signs of morbidity or mortality (data not shown). To further explore the consequences of blocking CXCR2 signaling early following infection, neuroinflammation was assessed by H&E staining of brains from JHMV-infected mice treated with either anti-CXCR2 or control sera at day 9 p.i. Such analysis revealed limited inflammatory cell infiltration, as demonstrated by an overall reduction in the size of the meningeal and perivascular infiltrates (\nFigure 4D\n), compared to mice treated with control serum (\nFigure 4C\n). Consistent with the reduced inflammation observed histologically, immunophenotyping the cellular infiltrate in the brain revealed an overall reduction in CD45high cells present within the brains of infected mice treated with anti-CXCR2 (\nFigure 4E\n). Moreover, blocking CXCR2 reduced CD8+ (\nFigure 4F\n) and CD4+ (\nFigure 4G\n) T cell infiltration, as well as reduced the numbers of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (\nFigure 4H\n) within the brains compared to control-treated mice. In contrast, if administration of anti-CXCR2 was delayed until 2 days p.i., mortality, T cell infiltration, and viral burden were unaffected, when compared to control-treated mice (Figure S2A\u2013D). Notably, a single treatment of CXCR2 antiserum at day +2 p.i. significantly (p<0.01) reduced neutrophil infiltration into the CNS at day 3 p.i. (anti-CXCR2, 8.3\u00d7103\u00b11.7\u00d7103 cells/g, n = 5) compared to control-treated mice (5.0\u00d7105\u00b11.2\u00d7105, n = 5) (Figure S2E). However, compared to mice that were treated with CXCR2 antiserum beginning at day \u22121 p.i., the levels of neutrophils within the CNS at day 3 p.i. was approximately 5 times greater [anti-CXCR2, 1.7\u00d7103\u00b12.7\u00d7102, n = 5; control-treated, 3\u00d7105\u00b11.8\u00d7104, n = 3) (\nFigure 3A\n). These findings indicate that CXCR2 signaling is protective; however the period of protection is confined to the earliest days following JHMV infection, coinciding with dramatic mobilization of PMNs from the blood and subsequent migration into the CNS.",

Similar numbers of virus \u2013 specific CD8+ T cells were generated in mice treated with either anti-CXCR2 or control sera as determined by measuring S510\u2013518 MHC class I tetramer \u2013 reactive cells (\nFigure 5A\n) and intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3 within cultured cells pulsed with either the S510\u2013518 (\nFigure 5B\n) or S598\u2013605 (\nFigure 5C\n) peptides. Similarly, there were no differences in the numbers of CD4+ T cells recognizing the M133\u2013147 peptide in anti-CXCR2-treated mice compared to control mice (\nFigure 5D\n). It has been reported that the absence of CXCR2 abrogates peripheral immune responses to pathogens [40]\u2013[46], therefore we also sought to determine whether antiviral responses were muted following CXCR2 neutralization following intraperitoneal (i.p.) challenge with JHMV. C57BL/6 mice were treated with either anti-CXCR2 or control serum beginning at day -1 before being infected i.p. with virus. The presence of virus \u2013 specific T cells within the spleen was assessed as described above. Similar frequencies and numbers of virus \u2013 specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were generated in both control and anti-CXCR2 antiserum treated animals (\nFigure 6 A\u2013D\n). Moreover, no difference in the expression of the T cell activation markers CD25, CD127, and CD44 was observed upon splenic T cells from mice treated with CXCR2 antiserum (\nFigure 6E and F\n). Finally, i.p. infection of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice with JHMV did not affect the generation of virus-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells compared to infected CXCR2+/+ mice (Figure S3). Therefore, these data clearly indicate that CXCR2 signaling does not influence the generation or expansion of virus \u2013 specific T cells following JHMV infection.",

First, we sought to ensure that CXCR2 \u2013deficient neutrophils were unresponsive to defined CXCR2 chemokine ligands. Our findings confirmed that PMNs isolated from the bone-marrow of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice did not express CXCR2 (\nFigure 7A\n), and, unlike CXCR2+/+ PMN, CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 PMN did not migrate in vitro in response to recombinant mouse CXCL1, CXCL2, or CXCL5 (\nFigures 7 B\u2013D\n), consistent with previous reports [47],[48]. CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice inoculated i.c. with JHMV exhibited an approximate 60% reduction (p<0.05) in PMN migration to the CNS compared to wildtype littermates at day 3 p.i. (\nFigure 8A\n). However, neutrophil infiltration into the CNS of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice was not completely eliminated, as previously observed following anti-CXCR2 treatment of JHMV-infected wildtype mice (\nFigure 3A\n). Correspondingly, there was no difference in mortality (\nFigure 8B\n) or brain viral titers (\nFigure 8C\n) between JHMV-infected CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice and CXCR2+/+ mice. Additionally, both CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 and CXCR2+/+ displayed similar amounts of Evans Blue extravasation into the brain at day 3 p.i. (\nFigure 8D\n). To assess potential compensatory mechanisms that may allow for CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 neutrophils to enter the CNS, we evaluated expression of CXCR1, an alternate receptor for ELR+ chemokines [49], on neutrophils. Neutrophils isolated from the bone marrows of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited enriched levels of CXCR1 mRNA transcripts compared to CXCR2+/+ neutrophils suggesting that, in vivo, this may be used as an alternate receptor for migration to the CNS (\nFigure 8E\n). In order to demonstrate that the CXCR2 anti-serum did not have any off \u2013 target effects, JHMV \u2013 infected CXCR2 \u2013 deficient and wildtype littermates were treated with anti-CXCR2 or NRS beginning at day -1 p.i. and PMN migration into the CNS at day 3 p.i. was determined. As shown in Figure S4A, anti-CXCR2 treatment did not affect neutrophil accumulation into the brains of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 animals, compared to CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice receiving control serum. Similar numbers and frequencies of PMNs were also present within the CNS of knockout mice treated with either anti-CXCR2 antiserum or control serum (Figure S4A) compared to untreated CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with JHMV (\nFigure 8A\n). In contrast, anti-CXCR2 treatment of JHMV-infected CXCR2+/+ mice reduced (>96%) PMN migration to the CNS (Figure S4B). These findings indicate that the CXCR2 blocking antibody is specific and suggest that genetic deletion of CXCR2 allows for compensatory mechanisms to emerge, such as utilization of CXCR1, that support PMN trafficking into the CNS in response to viral infection.",

            "text": "We have examined the role of ELR+ chemokines in host defense following infection of susceptible mice with the neurotropic coronavirus, JHMV. Early following JHMV infection, CXCR2-positive neutrophils are mobilized into the bloodstream and migrate to the CNS in response to elevated expression of the ELR+ chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5. Early administration of a blocking antibody specific for CXCR2 to JHMV-infected mice reduced >95% of PMN migration into the CNS, and this corresponded with increased mortality and uncontrolled viral replication. Subsequent studies revealed that anti-CXCR2 treatment prevented PMN-mediated BBB permeabilization, associated with muted MMP-9 activity, and ultimately resulted in the impaired accumulation of virus-specific T cells within the CNS. These findings emphasize the importance of rapid neutrophil recruitment to the CNS in response to viral infection of the CNS to facilitate control of viral replication. Moreover, our findings highlight that the numbers of neutrophils recruited to the CNS is critical in defense as JHMV-infection of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice or delayed anti-CXCR2 treatment resulted in efficient control of viral replication, and this was associated with greater numbers of neutrophils within the CNS compared to mice treated prior to infection with blocking antibody. Collectively, our studies support and extend others highlighting the functional role of neutrophils in promoting vascular permeability in response to infection or injury to the CNS [25],[26],[50]. This is elegantly illustrated in the studies by McGavern and colleagues [50] that defined the importance of myelomonocytic cell recruitment to the CNS in response to LCMV infection with regards to contributing to fatal viral meningitis via promoting massive vascular injury. Importantly, interventional therapies targeting myeloid cell trafficking to the CNS during acute viral infection may offer a powerful approach to dampen neuroinflammation and decrease fatalities associated with viral encephalopathies.",

            "text": "In agreement with previous reports [51], we have also observed that CXCR2 signaling is important for neutrophil release from the bone marrow into the blood. Blocking CXCR2 dramatically reduced neutrophil mobilization into the bloodstream in response to JHMV infection. Notably, neutrophil entry into the blood was not completely inhibited, indicating that there may be additional signaling components that aid neutrophil release such as CXCL12 downregulation or G-CSF induction [51],[52]. CXCR2 neutralization also reduces circulating levels of neutrophils within uninfected mice (data not shown), suggesting that CXCR2 ligands contribute to both normal neutrophil homeostasis and emergency release following infection with a neurotropic virus. Our studies highlight a previously unappreciated functional role for ELR+ chemokines in host defense during viral-induced encephalomyelitis, rapidly recruiting PMNs into the blood with subsequent infiltration into the CNS, thus enhancing protection by contributing to the disruption of the BBB and facilitating anti-viral inflammatory T cell access. The protease MMP-9 is specific for the structural components of the BBB, including type IV collagen and laminin, and it is associated with BBB breakdown in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia [53]. Although MMP-9 is associated with the loss of BBB integrity following JHMV infection, it is likely that additional PMN-associated molecules including \u03b22-integrin, azurocidin, and glutamate participate in BBB damage, as these components can also contribute to the disruption of endothelial cell adherens junctions [54]\u2013[58]. Additionally, MMP-9 may also be contributing to the degradation of the parenchymal basement membranes and glia limitans that regulate leukocyte infiltration from the perivascular space into the parenchyma [59].",

            "text": "Infection of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice with JHMV did not recapitulate our observations with infected wildtype mice treated with CXCR2 antiserum. While neutrophil infiltration into the CNS was reduced by approximately 60% at day 3 p.i, CXCR2 \u2013 deficient mice experienced no deficits in survival, viral clearance, or BBB degradation. Our demonstration that PMN migration to the CNS of JHMV-infected CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice was not altered following administration of anti-CXCR2 signaling emphasizes the specificity of this reagent and suggests that compensatory mechanisms allow for sufficient numbers of neutrophils to migrate to the CNS that enable BBB breakdown and infiltration of virus-specific T cells. However, it is notable that our observations are in contrast to previous reports utilizing CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice in models of host defense following infection of the CNS. For example, Del Rio et al. [40] demonstrated elevated numbers of T. gondii cysts within the brains of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, yet all of the immune defects occurred within the periphery, suggesting CXCR2-mediated protection occurs in a manner independent of leukocyte trafficking. Additionally, Kielian et al. [27] have shown that in a model of S. aureus experimental brain abscess neutrophil extravasation into the brain is impaired in CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, resulting in moderately increased bacterial burdens and pathology. However, the authors did not assess long-term bacterial clearance in the CXCR2 \u2013 deficient mice, nor quantitate total neutrophil or other immune cell infiltration that may have been impacted. Moreover, in experimental brain abscesses, neutrophils have direct anti-bacterial roles [60], while during JHMV infection, neutrophils are responsible for the permeabilization of the BBB [26], so functional differences of these cells in host defense may explain differences between the model systems. Our assessment of CXCR2 staining on neutrophils isolated within both the blood and brain of wildtype mice revealed that a small population of neutrophils was unreactive to CXCR2 antiserum. These findings argue for either transient receptor internalization following ligand binding [61] or alternative mechanisms of neutrophil attraction in the absence of CXCR2 signaling. Neutrophils have been reported to be chemotactic to cleaved complement products [48], leukotrienes [62], and other chemokines [63]\u2013[65]\nin vitro and in vivo. Moreover, a functional murine homolog for CXCR1 has recently been identified and this may serve to mediate PMN trafficking to the CNS in response to JHMV infection [49]. Indeed, neutrophils enriched from the bone marrow of CXCR2 \u2013 deficient mice expressed noticeably increased transcripts specific for CXCR1, whereas transcripts were barely detectable within neutrophils from wild type mice, indicating that CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 neutrophils may be compensating through increased expression of CXCR1. In addition, we have observed elevated numbers of PMNs residing within the CNS of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice in the absence of infection (data not shown), suggesting potentially highly dysregulated myeloid cells in these mice. The fact that these cells are present prior to JHMV-infection suggests the possibility that viral infection results in local activation that contributes to BBB breakdown and may account for the muted CD11b expression upon CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 neutrophils within the CNS.",

            "text": "Recent evidence indicates that neutrophils are capable of influencing the generation of an adaptive immune response following infection. Neutrophil activation results in secretion of the cytokines IL-12/23 p40 that are associated with tailoring T cell-specific responses following antigenic challenge [66],[67]. Furthermore, neutrophils are capable of secreting chemokines such as CCL3 and CCL4 that also influence dendritic cell function, and thus they have been suggested to regulate T cell polarization via dendritic cell activation [68]. Additionally, the generation of TH1 immune reponses to a variety of pathogens is negatively impacted within neutropenic mice [41]\u2013[46]. However, our findings clearly indicate that in the absence of CXCR2 signaling there are no deficiencies in either the frequencies or numbers of JHMV \u2013 specific T cells or T cell activation markers, regardless of whether mice were challenged within the CNS or peripherally.",

            "text": "Our results complement previous work that has highlighted the importance of ELR-positive chemokines and PMNs in promoting vascular permeability and subsequent immune cell infiltration into the CNS. CNS-specific transgenic expression of CXCL1 was associated with disruption of the BBB and neutrophil infiltration into the brain parenchyma [69]. Moreover, blocking CXCR2 signaling inhibits neutrophil-mediated BBB damage and dampens CNS inflammation in autoimmune demyelination and spinal cord injury [23]\u2013[25]. Although the mechanisms associated with induction of ELR+ chemokines expression within the CNS of JHMV-infected mice have yet to be characterized, intracerebral administration or localized transgenic expression of IL-1\u03b2 within the brain enhances CXCL1 expression, inducing neutrophil accumulation and subsequent BBB breakdown [70],[71]. Collectively, these findings have implications for other neurotropic viruses, including West Nile virus, as PMN represent an early and predominant inflammatory infiltrate in response to viral infection [72]. Therefore, understanding the signaling mechanisms governing inflammation in response to viral infection raises the possibility of selectively muting specific pathways associated with BBB breakdown and CNS inflammation which may have therapeutic benefits within the context of human neuroinflammatory diseases that arise in the apparent absence of an infectious trigger.",
