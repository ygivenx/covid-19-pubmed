            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in children under the age of 5 years [1, 2]. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is the leading cause of hospitalization in children and of febrile episodes in infants younger than 3 months old [3, 4]. The most common cause of SARI in children is viral infections [5\u201310], including influenza viruses A and B (Flu A/B); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); adenovirus (ADV); parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1\u20133; picornavirus (PIC), which mainly includes human rhinovirus (RV) and human enterovirus (EV); human coronaviruses (HCoV), which includes OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU; human bocavirus (HBoV); and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Although the viral and epidemiological profiles of pediatric patients with SARI vary among countries [4, 7\u201315], few studies have comprehensively compared the viral and epidemiological profiles of pediatric patients with SARI in different geographic areas or climate zones within the same country, such as China.",

Beijing is located in the North of China on the Pacific Ocean, which stands at the northern tip of the North China Plain. Beijing has a semi-humid continental climate in the warm temperate zone. The spring and autumn are relatively short when compared with the duration of summer and winter. The annual temperature is around 11.8 degree Celsius, January can be considered as the coldest month in Beijing for average temperature at \u2212 4.6 degree Celsius, while July will be the hottest month in Beijing. Shanghai is the largest city in China, with a population of more than 25 million. The city is located in the southeast region of the country and has a subtropical monsoon climate. Shanghai lies on China\u2019s east coast roughly equidistant from Beijing. Shanghai\u2019s climate is classified as humid subtropical and experiences four distinct seasons. Summer temperatures at noontime often hit 35\u201336 \u00b0C (95\u201397 \u00b0F) with very high humidity. Winters are chilly and damp, with northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. In between, spring can feature lengthy periods of cloudy, often rainy, weather, while Autumn is generally mild to dry and sunny. The city averages 4.8 \u00b0C (40.6 \u00b0F) in January and 28.6 \u00b0C (83.5 \u00b0F) in July, for an annual mean of 17.1 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F).",

Our study is the first to compare respiratory viral infections and their epidemiology in hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing and Shanghai. Of the 700 patients included in the study, 78.1% tested positive for at least one virus; this rate was higher than that reported by previous studies (range, 34.6\u201370.3%) [18\u201325]. This finding may be mainly explained by some differences in the SARI case inclusion criteria, since additional criteria in our study were a normal or low leukocyte count or indrawing of the lower chest wall. In addition, several factors may account for this disparity, including true differences in the overall burden or differences in study populations or methodologies [18, 23\u201325]. Moreover, infection rates vary with geographical location and season [22, 26, 27]. Finally, the specific viruses included in our screening decisions may account for the higher positive rates in our study. The positive infection rate in Beijing was slightly higher than that in Shanghai (92.7 vs. 70.1%, respectively). Given the small number of cases and the limited testing period, further studies are needed to determine whether infection rates significantly differ in the two cities.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare the profiles of multiple (about 15) viruses and their related epidemiological profiles in pediatric patients with SARI in China. Viral infection was tested and shown to be the most prevalent etiological agent among children with SARI in either the Beijing or the Shanghai area, while showing different patterns of viral and epidemiological profiles. The observed pattern of seasonal variation of respiratory viruses are complex between hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing and Shanghai, since the weather and temperature variations between the two cities. Our findings provide a better understanding of the roles of geographic location and climate in respiratory viral infections in hospitalized children with SARI. In addition, our findings provide baseline data for investigations of the burden of respiratory viral infections in Beijing and Shanghai. However, additional studies with larger patient populations are needed to clarify the roles of viral and bacterial pathogens in SARI cases and to evaluate the overall burden of respiratory pathogens in asymptomatic children [40].",
