Upon recognition of viral components, host cells are activated to produce type I interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby upregulating a family of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that exert pleiotropic inhibitory effects on viral replication in neighboring cells [6], [7]. Type I IFN production requires tight control to achieve the appropriate immune response to invading pathogens without triggering an immune disorder [8]. Consequently, viruses have developed strategies to evade and antagonize the host immune response and resist the antiviral actions of IFN therapy. However, the mechanism(s) underlying such immune evasion is not clear.",

They function primarily by binding to the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs to achieve post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression [9]. Many miRNAs have been reported to regulate a wide range of biological processes, including development [10], cell differentiation [11], proliferation, and apoptosis [12]\u2013[14]. Many miRNAs, including miR-146 [15], miR-155 [16]\u2013[18], miR-98, and let-7 [19], participate in innate and adaptive immune responses [20]\u2013[22]. miR-21 was found to be more strongly expressed in HCC specimens than in non-tumorous tissues [23], and participates in HCC development by regulating the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) gene [24]. miR-21 is also overexpressed in HCV-positive liver biopsy samples, as assessed by microarray analysis [25]. Although these results suggest the involvement of miR-21 in antiviral responses, no studies have reported the mechanism that underlies the regulation of type I IFN signaling mediated by miR-21 or the antiviral response of miR-21 to type I IFN signaling.",

Upregulated miR-21 suppressed MyD88 and IRAK1 expression in hepatocytes, which subsequently repressed type I IFN effector gene expression and the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, thereby promoting viral replication. In addition, miR-21 also enhanced the replication of other viruses such as enterovirus 71 (EV71), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by repressing type-I IFN production. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to show that miR-21 is upregulated upon RNA virus infection and acts as a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling by targeting MyD88 and IRAK1.",

To determine the relationship between HCV infection and miR-21 activation, we determined the levels of miR-21 in hepatocytes infected with the virus. The results from quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that miR-21 levels were increased in human Huh7 hepatocytes 1 h after infection HCV strain JFH-1 and reached a peak 6 h after HCV exposure (Figure 1A); this response was dose-dependent (Figure 1B). To understand the kinetics of miR-21 induction in HCV infection, we measured the expression of primary miR-21 (pri-miR-21) and miR-21 precursor (pre-miR-21). The induction of pri-miR-21 and pre-miR-21 were coincided with that of mature miR-21 and occurred as early as 2h.p.i. (Figure S1A). We cannot rule out the possibility that the increased miR-21 induced by HCV infection was due to nonspecific effects. To assess this possibility, a random non-HCV-related miRNA (miR-93) was analyzed after HCV infection (Figure S1B). Moreover, cells inoculated with UV-irradiated inactive HCV were also used as another negative control. As the same result of miR-93, the expression level of miR-21 was shown to have no significant changes (Figure S1C). These results indicated that HCV activated miR-21 expression in hepatocytes.",

To analyze the roles of these regulatory elements in the regulation of HCV-mediated miR-21 expression, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids (f1\u2013f4) in which either full-length miPPR-21 or truncation mutants of this promoter were fused to the 5\u2032 end of the firefly luciferase gene (Figure 2C, upper panel). Full-length miPPR-21 displays clear NS5A (Figure 2C, right panel) or NS3/4A (Figure 2C, left panel) inducibility, which is decreased by truncations of this promoter region, indicating that the distal AP-1 site is involved in the induction of miR-21 by NS5A and NS3/4A.

Time course analysis revealed that IFN-\u03b1 was rapidly induced, reaching peak concentrations within 12 h (Figure 5B).

Here, we investigated the effect of miR-21 on the expression of IRF-7. qPCR (Figure S5A) and RT-PCR (Figure S5B) results showed that the levels of IRF-7 mRNA were decreased upon treatment with miR-21 and increased upon treatment with miR-21 inhibitor.

We used RNA22 and FINDTAR3 software to predict miR-21 targets and found putative miR-21 binding sites in the 3\u2032 UTRs of human MyD88 and IRAK1 (Figure 9A). To verify the possibility that MyD88 and IRAK1 were regulated post-transcriptionally by miR-21, we constructed reporter plasmids by cloning these miR-21 binding sites into the 3\u2032 UTRs of firefly luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP). A four base pair mutation (mutant type) was introduced into the miR-21 binding site within the 3\u2032UTR of IRAK1 or MyD88 cDNA (Figure S7A). After co-transfecting the luciferase reporter plasmids into Huh7 cells with vectors expressing miR-21 mimics or inhibitors, we observed that miR-21 mimics markedly decreased luciferase expression, whereas miR-21 inhibitors increased luciferase expression (Figure 9B). miR-21 mimics also downregulated GFP gene expression when the 3\u2032-UTR of MyD88 or IRAK1 was cloned into the 3\u2032-UTR region of GFP in HEK293 cells, as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 9C). Paralleling the previous results, neither luciferase nor GFP gene expression could be regulated by miR-21 with a mutant-type 3\u2032UTR (Figure S7B and S7C). Furthermore, transfection of miR-21 mimics decreased MyD88 and IRAK1 expression in Huh7 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Figure 9D), whereas miR-21 inhibitors increased MyD88 and IRAK1 expression (Figure 9E), suggesting that MyD88 and IRAK1 expression could be inhibited by miR-21 via both translational inhibition and mRNA degradation. Taken together, these results show that miR-21 regulates the expression of MyD88 and IRAK1, suggesting the possibility that human MyD88 and IRAK1 are new targets of miR-21.",

However, viruses adopt various strategies to evade host defenses [46]. Molecular mechanisms by which viruses trigger and regulate these antiviral processes have recently been characterized. The host response launches an innate immune defense against HCV infection [47], and HCV evades the host response through a multifaceted process that includes signaling interference, effector modulation, and continuous genetic variation. These evasion strategies promote the persistent infection and spread of HCV; therefore, identifying the precise molecular mechanisms by which HCV regulates the host response may reveal novel therapeutic targets. The TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in virus recognition and initiation of the antiviral response in immune cells.

            "text": "The mechanism involved in the activation of miR-21 mediated by HCV infection was further investigated. Our results showed that AP-1 is at least partially responsible for the upregulation of miR-21. Recently, some researchers have demonstrated that AP-1 activates the miR-21 transcription in conjunction with the switch/sucrose non fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation through the conserved AP-1 and PU.1 binding sites in the promoter. Hence, it is possible that posttranscriptional processing and/or decay of miRNAs may also contribute to the unequal upregulation of miR-21 during HCV infection. AP-1 is a cellular transcription factor complex involved in several cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. It has recently been reported that AP-1 is induced during infections by various viruses, including hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and HIV, and that this induction promotes viral replication. Many viral proteins can induce multiple signaling pathways, which may cross-talk with each other or converge on common downstream effectors. In the present study, we demonstrated that AP-1 is essential for NS5A and NS3/4A protein-induced miR-21 expression, as mutations in AP-1 binding sites eliminated the protein-induced activation of miR-21 promoter activity. Based on our finding that the NS5A and NS3/4A proteins activate c-Jun and c-Fos expression, respectively, we further investigated the roles of different MAP kinases in the activation of miR-21 by the two proteins. The results suggested that ERK, JNK, and PKC were all involved in the HCV-mediated activation of miR-21. Additionally, active PKC\u03b1/ERK was required for the binding of c-Fos to the miR-21 promoter in response to NS3/4A protein stimulation; the PKC\u03b5/JNK pathway is the important signaling pathway in the regulation of c-Jun by the NS5A protein. According to our confocal immunofluorescence results, NS3/4A and NS5A were distributed in the cytoplasm evenly (Figure S10), and this observation was consistent with the previous results [52], [53]. However, there is also evidence that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of NS5A can be detected in the nucleus, though the full-length NS5A protein is localized in cytoplasm [54]. This, therefore, suggests that NS5A may have the ability to translocate into the nucleus and function as an activator of transcription when the NLS is exposed.",

The major targets and functions of a specific miRNA vary under different physiological or pathological conditions and in different cell types. miR-21 appears to participate in various biological processes by targeting different genes, including PTEN [24], DNMT1 [55], PDCD4 [56] and FasL [57]. The abundance of different miRNAs following HCV infection has already been examined [58], [59], and the overexpression of miR-21 has also been shown. However, the upregulation of miR-21 to downregulate specific proteins involved in the IFN response has not been described. In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-21 functions as a negative regulator, targeting MyD88 and IRAK1 in HCV-infected hepatocytes to attenuate IFN signaling, thereby facilitating HCV evasion of antiviral responses. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the role of miR-21 in host\u2013virus interactions.",

The activation of STAT1 and STAT2 mainly occurs through the IFN-JAK/STAT pathway, so we evaluated the initiation point of this pathway, IFN-associated receptors (IFNARs), and found that miR-21 overexpression reduced IFNARs expression (Figure 7). According to these results, the induction of miR-21 can disturb the JAK-STAT pathway, which is a logical reason for its upregulation on HCV upon replication.",

Measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus inhibit TLR7-dependent and TLR9-dependent IFN signaling stimulated by resiquimod and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides in primary human plasmacytoid dendritic cells [65]. Here, we report the novel regulation of TLR-MyD88 signaling by miRNA. First, we found that HCV infection upregulated miR-21 expression in hepatocytes. Second, we demonstrated that miR-21 suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thereby promoting HCV replication, and thus, demonstrating a novel mechanism for viral immune evasion. Third, we demonstrated that both human MyD88 and IRAK1 are targets of miR-21. In this new model of HCV infection, HCV is first identified by TLRs and retinoic-acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), which in turn initiate type I IFN production against HCV infection. Meanwhile, HCV infections can also upregulated the expression of miR-21, which counteracted the IFN-mediated antiviral response by inhibiting TLR-MyD88 signaling. Consistently, miR-21 overexpression stimulated replication and production of HCV, VSV, HIV and EV71. Intriguingly, unlike the other three viruses, levels of miR-21 were not induced significantly by EV71 (Figure 11). As it has been reported that EV71 fails to stimulate the expression of type I IFN in mammalian cells [66], the upregulation of miR-21 expression may not be required after EV71 infection. Induction of miR-21 expression may be a new survival strategy of the virus to escape the antiviral immune response of the host.",

HCV evades the host response through a complex combination of virus-host interactions that disrupt intracellular signaling pathways and attenuate the antiviral actions of IFN. Viral regulation of the host response impairs the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity and provides a foundation for HCV replication and spreading. It is generally thought that miRNAs target multiple mRNAs, termed the targetome, to regulate gene expression. A single miRNA might fine-tune the protein synthesis of thousands of genes directly or indirectly [67]. In the present study, human MyD88 and IRAK1 were shown to be novel targets of miR-21, contributing to the negative regulatory feedback function of miR-21 in TLR-MyD88 signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-21 may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention; however, this needs to be verified in future studies.",

Furthermore, the NS5A protein was shown to inhibit the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway through a direct interaction with the death domain of MyD88 through the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) [48]. In this study, we found that the functional mechanism of miR-21 action through MyD88 and IRAK1, which was also modulated by NS3/4A and NS5A protein expression, could be another mechanism independent pathway of the TRIF pathway for impairing the type I IFN-associated antiviral response during HCV infection (Figure S7).",

            "text": "Figure 12: During HCV infection, the virus is first recognized by TLRs and RIG-1, which in turn activates MyD88 and IRAK1 to initiate IFN-\u03b1 synthesis, resulting in the activation of ISGs and the inhibition of HCV replication. In addition, miR-21 expression is activated during HCV infection through two signaling pathways: the PKC\u03b5/JNK/c-Jun pathway and the PKC\u03b1/ERK/c-Fos pathway. The HCV NS5A protein activates PKC\u03b5 to enhance the expression of JNK and c-Jun, while the HCV NS3/4A complex stimulates PKC\u03b1 to promote the production of ERK and c-Fos. The two subunits (c-Jun and c-Fos) of AP-1 join together to recognize the miR-21 promoter and activate the expression of miR-21, which represses the expression of MyD88 and IRAK1 via imperfect base pairing between miR-21 and the 3\u2032UTR of MyD88 and IRAK1. The reduction in MyD88 and IRAK1 causes a reduction of type-I IFN production and ISG expression that might contribute to viral pathogenesis and virus propagation.",
