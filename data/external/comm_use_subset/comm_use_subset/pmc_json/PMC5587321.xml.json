            "text": "Influenza A nomenclature is based on the genotypic properties of two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Currently, 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been recognized [8]. The primary target of host neutralizing antibodies is the HA glycoprotein where it inhibits binding to the sialic acid receptors present in the respiratory tract [9]. There are five identified antigenic sites for A(H3N2), namely, A, B, C, D and E [10]. Non-recognition of some strains by neutralizing antibodies present in the host is the consequence of mutations at these sites [11]. Continuous build-up of mutations at these antigenic sites is the basis for the evolutionary dynamics observed in the influenza virus resulting in antigenic drift [12]. About seven A(H3N2) clades (designated clades 1 to 7) and many sub-clades have evolved over the past few years, providing a significant challenge for the annual design of effective influenza vaccines [13]. At present, viruses in clade 3 are the dominant group, which has diversified further into three major subclades designated 3A, 3B, and 3C, with subclade 3C containing several distinguishable genetic groups [13, 14].",

Although influenza vaccination is very limited in most of Africa, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, there have been previous reports of introduction of viruses that have undergone drift due to antiviral and vaccine pressure [16, 17] from other regions. There is therefore, a crucial need for monitoring the genetic and antigenic characteristics as well as drug susceptibility of influenza viruses as a component of pandemic preparedness [16]. To better understand the molecular evolution of influenza and assess vaccine efficacy in Cameroon, three gene segments of A(H3N2) from 2014 to 2016 were characterized.",

Pepitope measures the antigenic distance between the vaccine strain and the dominant circulating strains, and it is calculated as follows: (number of mutations in the dominant epitope)/(number of amino acids in the dominant epitope). The mathematical formula linking vaccine efficacy for influenza A(H3N2) and Pepitope is given by E = \u22122.47 \u00d7 Pepitope + 0.47 for [23]. When the Pepitope between the vaccine and circulating strains is null, the influenza A(H3N2) vaccine efficacy is 47% [21]. This model correlates best with vaccine efficacy as compared to phylogenetic analyses or antisera hemagglutination inhibition assay [21].",

Several amino acid mutations on epitope A of the HA gene were responsible for the drift between the circulating strains and the 2014\u20132015 vaccine strains, 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like strain. This corroborates with the Pepitope > 0.19 observed, and eventually resulting in a negative vaccine efficacy. The vaccine change to the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like strain for the following season resulted in more than 80% of the circulating H3N2 strains not covered by the selected vaccine. Notwithstanding the poor results with the previous influenza seasons, the 2016\u20132017 selected vaccine strain showed moderate efficacy when compared to the circulating virus strains. It is noteworthy that vaccination against influenza virus, is not a common phenomenon in the Cameroon population, however a better selection of annual vaccine with the use of Pepitope as suggested by other authors, [21] will improve vaccine efficacy and encourage uptake of flu vaccine. This may result in reduced burden caused by influenza due to herd immunity [35].",

Neuraminidase inhibitors target the NA glycoprotein which plays a key role in the production of new viral progeny. There have been rare reports of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors in influenza H3N2 virus strains [27], and this was confirmed Cameroonian virus strains by the absence of previous mutations characteristic of this resistance. There was however a novel amino an amino acid mutation, Q136H, that had not been previously reported. Further investigation on the clinical relevance of this mutation will be essential for a better understanding of the molecular evolution of influenza A(H3N2).",

High prevalence of amantadine resistance in influenza A viruses was observed in other countries, irrespective of its use [25, 26]. Resistance to M2 inhibitors first appeared following extensive drug use in Asia and the US after the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic in 2004. Since there is no history of exposure to anti-viral drugs against influenza and eventually to adamantanes, Cameroonian virus strains with S31N mutation indicated that strains already harbouring drug resistant mutation were most likely introduced in the community. These resistant strains probably have a selective advantage over the sensitive strains that favour their evolution and fitness [36].",

The Cameroonian H3N2 virus strains shared at least nine potential N-glycosylation sites with the 2014\u20132017 vaccine strains, and had similar glycosylation patterns. Group 3C.2a-like strains had acquired 2 additional glycosylation sites: 126NWT128 and 158NYT160. The predicted HA glycosylation patterns may contribute to a potential antigenic escape of influenza H3N2 viruses from antibodies raised against vaccine strain and previous circulating strains or increase viral fitness by yet-to-be-characterized mechanisms.",
