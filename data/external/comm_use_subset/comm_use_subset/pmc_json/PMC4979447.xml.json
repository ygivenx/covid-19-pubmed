The classical literature is full of examples in which bats are associated with evil and darkness. The roman poet Ovid narrates in the Metamorphoses that the god Bacchus transforms the daughters of Mineus, king of Boeotia, into bats as a punishment for profanating his celebration (Figure 1 and Box A). In the Divine Comedy (Inferno \u2013 Canto XXXIV), Dante Alighieri, the father of the italian language, describes the devil Lucifer as bearing large bat wings (Figure 2 and Box B). In the eighteenth century, scientists called \u2018vampire\u2019 a bat that fed on blood, giving rise to the myth of human vampires that sucked blood from other men and could transform into bats. The Irish novelist Bram Stoker with his novel, Dracula (1897) did nothing but make this belief famous worldwide. More recently, Bob Kane, an American comic book artist, ideated a character called Batman a positive character that, however, disguises in a bat costume to scare his enemies: \u2018Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot. So my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible..... \u2018Just then a huge bat flies in the open window\u2019. A bat! That\u2019s it! It\u2019s an omen. I shall become a bat! In: Detective Comics no 33, 1939.",

Bats can transmit infectious agents to humans through intermediate hosts, which are in close contact with humans.4 These intermediate hosts can be infected in many ways, including ingestion of food partially digested by bats. Frugivorous bats, in fact, cannot ingest wide amounts of food because of the aerodynamics of flight,5 therefore, they extract nutrients by chewing fruits and spitting the residues. This partially digested food dropped on the ground can then be ingested by other animals and is a potential infectious source. A similar modality of viral transmission has also been described for insectivorous bats.5 Bats can also directly infect humans.4 This can occur through ingestion of infected bat meat, as in some areas bats are a food source, or through bat\u2019s bite as in the case of rabies virus.",

Moreover, unlike many other small mammals, bats live >30 years. Their long life makes them a great reservoir for pathogens and gives them many occasions to transmit them to other species.

Several years later, rabies was also detected in non-hematophagous bat species.13 Although RABV is found worldwide in several terrestrial hosts, its presence in bats is observed only in the Americas. In Europe, four different Lyssaviruses have been isolated from bats: European Bat Lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) and European Bat Lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2), Bokeloh Bat Lyssavirus (BBLV) and West Caucasian Bat Virus (WCBV).14 Recently, a new putative Lyssavirus in bat, named Lleida Bat Lyssavirus (LLBV), was found in Spain.15 To date, no human exposure to LLBV has been reported. EBLV-1, with the sub-types EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b, is the most isolated type throughout Europe. In addition, spillover infections by EBLV-1 in other mammals were also observed.13,14 The type 2 of EBLV is believed to be less virulent than type 113 and is found less frequently being present only in few countries and human contamination has been reported only in two cases.14 Two other members of this family are found in bats but significantly less frequently than the previous ones: BBLV isolated in Germany and France13,16,17; WCBV isolated once in the Caucasus Mountains but also detected in Kenya in seropositive bats, suggesting a greater geographical distribution.14,18 Australian Bat Lyssavirus (ABLV) is the first endemic lyssavirus identified in Australia and is phylogenetically related to RABV and EBLV1.10,19 ABLV has been identified in all flying fox species on Australia\u2019s land mass. Three fatal human infections by ABLV have been reported. Additionally, other viruses of this family detected in bats are summarized in Table 1.",

In 1976, a virus with similar characteristics but immunologically distinct was isolated in the Northern Democratic Republic of Congo and it was named Ebolavirus.32 Both viruses have generated several epidemics during the past years.31 Recently, in 2014, the largest ever registered Ebola epidemic started in West Africa and has affected several countries with >10 000 confirmed cases and thousands of deaths (Source CDC Atlanta, USA: 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, updated 22 September 2015). The natural reservoirs for Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus are both fruit and insectivorous bat species, indicating that these filoviruses are multihost parasites.31,33 The virus is transmitted to humans through contact with body fluids \u2013 mainly blood and feces \u2013 and dead bodies of infected bats. Other animals such as monkeys and apes can also develop the disease and in turn transmit it to humans. Epidemics usually are a consequence of human-to-human transmission of the virus (Figure 3).",

It causes respiratory tract infections, resulting in moderate-to-severe disease and occasionally death. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes on the basis of two surface glycoproteins, namely, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Influenza A virus is an uncommon promiscuous virus with a wide host range, including humans, pigs and birds. Recently, two new subtypes evolutionarily distinct from all others \u2013 H17N10 and H18N11 \u2013 were detected in different fruit bat species in Central and South America.35,36 It has been observed that, although H17N10 subtype is phylogenetically separate from all other subtypes, the virus genome is compatible with genetic exchange with human influenza A viruses, suggesting a potential re-assortment capability between subtypes and the consequent ability to generate highly pathogenic hybrid forms.35 More recently, serological evidence of influenza A virus subtypes other than H17N10 and H18N11 were reported in African frugivorous bats.37 In particular, about 30% antibody detection rate was found against avian H9 subtype known to cause infections in humans worldwide.38 These data, albeit preliminary, suggest that bats might represent asymptomatic mammalian carriers of influenza A viruses.37 Thus, similar to other pathogens, bats may represent a considerable reservoir for these viruses.",

The first hantavirus isolated from bats was the Hantaan virus, the etiological agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.41 Successively, hantaviruses were identified in other bat species, but to date, however, no bat-to-human transmission of hantaviruses has been observed.39",

Bats are an important reservoir of several pathogenic agents, mainly viruses, and many of them have already caused disease outbreaks worldwide. The increasing rate of bat-associated infections is also supported by an expanding overlap between bat and human habitats. Recently, to increase the knowledge of bat-associated viruses, a database has been constructed (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir).76 DbatVir analyzes the virome diversity of bats as well as the ecological and epidemiological data to examine and track current and future bat-related transmissible diseases. To date, DbatVir has collected information on 5717 bat-associated animal viruses detected from 207 bat species in 77 different countries (update on 2 march 2016). Strategies on surveillance and monitoring of disease outbreaks in bat populations need to be further developed, in particular where bats and humans are in close contact. Extensive studies are also needed to improve our understanding of bat\u2013human interactions to design new control measures in future. Furthermore, the identification of new human pathogens requires a continuous study to monitor the potential impact of these animals in their diffusion.",
