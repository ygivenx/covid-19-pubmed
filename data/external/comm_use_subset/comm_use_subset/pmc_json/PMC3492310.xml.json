            "text": "Genetic variation at adaptive gene loci provides direct information on selective processes involving the interaction of individuals with their environment and their capacity for future adaptive changes [1], [2]. Particularly relevant are genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) which evolve under selection pressure imposed by pathogens [2], [3], [4]. MHC genes encode MHC class I (MHC I) and class II (MHC II) proteins that recognize and present pathogen-derived peptides from intracellular (e.g. viruses) and extracellular (e.g. bacteria, helminths) origins, respectively, to cytotoxic and T-helper cells, thereby triggering a cascade of immune responses in vertebrates [5]. Two main selection scenarios are currently debated to explain susceptibility or resistance to parasite infections. One scenario relies on the resistance effects of specific MHC alleles selected frequency-dependent in space and time in form of negative frequency dependent selection, also known as rare-allele advantage\n[6], [7] or in terms of fluctuating selection\n[8], [9]. The other scenario is based on the assumption that two MHC molecules with different binding properties present different subsets and thus a higher variety of antigens. Heterozygous individuals (heterozygote advantage, overdominance\n[10]), or individuals carrying highly dissimilar alleles (divergent-allele advantage\n[10], [11]) are capable of initiating an appropriate immune response against a more diverse array of pathogens than homozygous individuals or individual with more similar alleles. These non-exclusive hypotheses have been studied by testing associations of specific MHC alleles with pathogens, the proportions of genotypes within populations, patterns of population structure, and the effects of genetic distance between genotypes [2], [12]. The majority of these studies focused on MHC II genotyping and simultaneously scanned for different types of pathogens of extracellular origin in the same individuals [12], [13]. In contrast to these studies, we present a novel approach that also permits a retrospective analysis. We conducted MHC I and II analysis in a carnivore population for which serological data were available from previous studies and formulated predictions on MHC allele/haplotype frequencies, heterozygosity, and genetic distance for the two selection scenarios.",

            "text": "For this study, we focused onthere is the world's largest remaining population of free-ranging African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). This population occurs in Namibia with an estimated population size of 3,100 to 5,800 individuals [14] and is considered a key population for the long-term survival of the species [15]. Free-ranging Namibian cheetahs concentrate in central Namibia, where a large proportion of individuals inhabit unprotected areas that encompass continuous privately owned livestock or game farmland often bordering towns and cities [16]. Consequently, free-ranging cheetahs on Namibian farmland potentially come into close proximity with domestic and feral dogs and cats that are sometimes unvaccinated [17]. Feral dogs and cats can be important vectors of diseases such as canine distemper, which is known to have affected free-ranging cheetahs in the Serengeti, Tanzania [18], [19]. Serosurveys of common feline and canine viruses such as feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline parvovirus (FPV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) confirmed the exposure of free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs to these viral pathogens and a similar virus diversity across the country, but no evidence of clinical signs of infectious diseases in the examined individuals was detected [20], [21]. However, results from these studies showed substantial differences in the exposure to viral pathogens between free-ranging Namibian cheetahs from north-central [20] and east-central [21] regions. The proportion of cheetahs tested positive for viruses was higher in north-central than in east-central Namibia [20], [21]. In north-central Namibia 65.3%, 48.0%, 29.2%, 24.3% and 12.2% of the cheetahs were seropositive for FCV, FPV, FCoV, CDV and FHV1, respectively [20], whereas in east-central Namibia only 4.5% (P<0.0001), 3.0% (P<0.0001), 3.0% (P<0.0001), 4.5% (P = 0.0012) and 3.0% (P = 0.059) of the cheetahs were seropositive for these viruses [21]. This result was attributed to higher human population densities in the north-central than in the east-central region which would affect contact opportunities of cheetahs with (non-vaccinated) domestic and feral cats and dogs [21].",

An essential pre-requisite for testing these predictions is the locus-specific assignment of MHC alleles in the species, which was previously conducted in Namibian cheetahs by combining information on the evolutionary affinities between the observed MHC alleles, qualitative expression analysis, and the distribution of alleles among 149 individuals [24]. A total of ten MHC I alleles and four MHC II-DRB alleles were identified in the population [24]. Here we compared patterns of MHC I and II-DRB exon 2 variation in terms of allelic diversity, heterozygosity and genetic distance among genotypes, and estimated the levels of genetic differentiation using allele and haplotype frequencies between free-ranging Namibian cheetahs from regions that differ in viral pathogen exposure. The heterozygote or divergent allele advantage hypothesis predicts a higher heterozygosity and higher genetic distance at MHC I loci in cheetahs from north-central than east-central Namibia due to an increased exposure to viruses in north-central Namibia. The higher selection pressure in this region might also lead to a higher allelic diversity.",

No differences in MHC II genetic variation would indicate a uniform extracellular pathogen distribution or suggest that intracellular-derived pathogens exert a stronger selection pressure than extracellular-derived pathogens.

The substitution is outside the functionally important antigen-binding sites and does not affect the results of this study in any way.

Using this information, we identified in this study seven and three genotypes for the six and four expressed alleles at the MHC I and II-DRB loci, respectively (Table 1). Locus A at MHC I and loci A and B at MHC II were monomorphic in all individuals analyzed, and thus they are likely to represent fixed alleles in the population, whereas the loci B and D at MHC I and locus C at MHC II were polymorphic. Allele and haplotype frequencies from polymorphic class I (MHC I-B, MHC I-D) and class II (MHC II DRB-C) loci are presented in Table 2. Mean HE was 0.35\u00b10.21 across both polymorphic MHC I loci and 0.50 for the polymorphic MHC II-DRB locus. This is lower than the mean expected heterozygosity observed at 38 microsatellite loci (mean HE = 0.64\u20130.71; [12]). H-W equilibrium was met at locus C of MHC II DRB but it deviated significantly (P = 0.0004) across loci B and D of MHC I, resulting in a deficit of heterozygotes (Table 2).

Conservation plans based solely on neutral genetic variation are not guaranteed to preserve adaptive genetic variation because both sources of genetic variation are not always positively correlated. Gene flow within a population might result in low differentiation in neutral markers, but there might still be high differentiation in adaptive markers in the population [37]. The Namibian cheetah population represents a large panmictic population as revealed by neutral microsatellite markers [22]. Yet, our results show a high differentiation in adaptive MHC I loci between cheetahs from east-central and north-central regions. This finding is of great relevance for the conservation of the Namibian cheetah population. Translocation of cheetahs within Namibia is an increasingly common management tool for conservation purposes. In light of our results, such translocations should be carefully planned as a wrongly chosen origin of or destination area for translocated animals may adversely affect their ability to cope with different pathogenic selection pressures. Therefore, further research should focus on MHC composition in relation to pathogen load in cheetahs from different African populations.",

The second exon (229 bp) of MHC I alleles was amplified using the primer Acju_Ex2MhcI_cF (5\u2032-GCTCCCACTCCCTGAGGTAT-3\u2032; [23]) and the newly designed primer Acju_Ex2MhcI_kR (5\u2032-GGAKTCGCTCTGGTTGTAGT-3\u2032) designed from MHC I transcript sequences available from felid species in GenBank, following PCR conditions as described in Castro-Prieto et al. (2011). The second exon (246 bp) of MHC II-DRB alleles was amplified using primers and PCR conditions as described in Castro-Prieto et al. (2011). Genotyping of MHC I and II-DRB was conducted through single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by sequence analysis of the distinctive single-strand bands as previously described [24]. To ensure that the sequences represented true alleles, the PCR-SSCP analysis was conducted twice per individual sample.",

The sequences were aligned and coding regions were translated into deduced amino acid sequences using Clustal W as implemented in MEGA 3.1 [40]. The MHC-like nature of the sequences was verified through a homology analysis using blastn (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Standard diversity indices were estimated using the software Arlequin 3.1 [41]. Allele frequencies were estimated at all putative loci separately and as a whole haplotype for MHC I loci. For haplotypes, the frequencies of co-occurring alleles (which presumably constitute a haplotype on a given chromosome) were estimated as the number of individual occurrences of a certain allele divided by its total count observed in the population. Expected heterozygosity (HE) was estimated as a general indicator of the amount of genetic variation in the population [42]. Departures from Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium were assessed by applying exact tests [43]. The genetic distance between individual alleles were calculated by the number of amino acid substitutions using the Poisson model as implemented in MEGA 3.1 [40].",

These two regions lack physical barriers but differ substantially in viral pathogen exposure as revealed by seroprevalence studies conducted in Namibian cheetahs [20], [21]. The ratio of males and females was similar in the north-central (N\nmales = 18, N\nfemales = 8) and the east-central region (N\nmales = 49, N\nfemales = 13, \u03c72 = 0.97, df = 1, p = 0.33). The prediction of different allele and haplotype frequencies between regions was tested by using F-statistics [44] and exact tests of sample differentiation [45] as implemented in Arlequin 3.1. Additionally, we used the chi-square (\u03c72) and Fisher's method of combined P values obtained by Fisher's exact test as implemented in CHIFISH [46] for MHC I loci. This was done because we combined information from multiple loci which may result in low statistical power and prevent detection of true genetic divergence [47]. This problem occurs particularly in small contingency tables (few populations and few alleles per locus) as observed in our data set. We also tested for differences in the allele and haplotype frequencies between male and female cheetahs to control for any effect due to the male-biased sampling. Differences in heterozygosity between north-central and east-central Namibian cheetahs as well as between males and females were tested with chi-square test in SPSS Version 16.0.",
