ZIKV is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes but can also spread through sexual contact, blood transfusions, or via mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy [3,4]. ZIKV was first discovered in Africa in 1947 [5] and was confined within the equatorial zone of Africa and Asia until the 2007 outbreak in Yap Island, which was then transmitted to French Polynesia and other Southern Pacific islands in 2013 [1,6]. It is believed that the adaptation and infectivity of ZIKV in mosquito-vectors contributed to the spread of the virus from Asia to the Americas [7]. The 2015 ZIKV outbreak and associated increase in microcephaly cases in Brazil increased global awareness [8]; to date, more than 84 countries have reported ZIKV infections [9]. It is known that ZIKV can cross the placental barrier, leading to fetal microcephaly, and can cause neurological complications in adults, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [10\u201312]. Currently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to mitigate the risk of ZIKV infection.",

E proteins are arranged as dimers, with three parallel dimers connected to form a raft, and with 30 rafts covering the viral surface [15]. The E protein mediates viral entry into host cells and membrane fusion and is the major target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine immunogens [16]. The flavivirus E ectodomain consists of three distinct domains, EDI, a 9-stranded beta-barrel that acts as a bridge between EDII and EDIII [17]; EDII, a finger-like structure that is responsible for the dimerization of soluble E protein monomers and viral fusion [18]; and EDIII, an immunoglobulin-like segment that is involved in host cell receptor recognition and viral fusion [19,20].",

These nAbs mainly recognize EDII, EDIII, and tertiary or quaternary epitopes that constitute E ectodomains. Although EDIII-targeted antibodies represent a relatively small population of E protein-binding antibodies, their presence is associated with serum neutralizing activity against ZIKV [21,25]. Among these nAbs, EDIII-targeted antibodies and EDII/E-dimer epitope (EDE)-targeted antibodies showed the most potent neutralization activities. In this study, we cloned and characterized E-targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from a Chinese patient who returned to China from a visit to Venezuela. Selected mAbs were evaluated for their neutralizing activities in vitro and in vivo via a ZIKV-infected neonatal severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model.",

After washing, CD3\u2212CD20+ CD27+IgG+HIS+ memory B cells were sorted using a multi-laser AriaII sorter. Individual B cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing 20 \u00b5L lysis buffer per cell. The lysis buffer contained 0.25 \u00b5L RNasin inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), 5 \u00b5L 5X first-strand buffer, 1.25 \u00b5L 0.1 M DTT, and 0.0625 \u00b5L IGEPAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). PCR plates with sorted cells were frozen on dry ice and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C or subjected to reverse transcription. RT-PCR and cloning into expression vectors was performed as previously described [27]. Briefly, 1 \u00b5L random hexamers (150 ng/\u00b5L; Promega), 2 \u00b5L dNTPs (each at 10 mM), and 0.5 \u00b5L SuperScript III (Invitrogen) were added to each well, followed by incubation at 42\u00b0C for 1 h. The IgG heavy and light chain variable regions were amplified independently by nested PCR [28]. First round PCR was performed using 2 \u00b5L cDNA directly following reverse transcription, with HotStart Taq Plus DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the primer mix. The PCR programme was initiated by 5 min incubation at 94\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 55\u00b0C (first round) or 60\u00b0C (second round) for 30s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 72\u00b0C for 10 min before cooling to 4\u00b0C. Using 2% agarose gels, the PCR products were evaluated, excised from the gel (approximately 500 bp for the heavy chain and 450 bp for kappa and lambda chains), and sent for Sanger sequencing after purification. Human antibody sequences were analysed using IMGT/V-QUEST (http://www.imgt.org/) [29]. Full-length IgG1 was expressed by co-transfecting HEK-293 T cells with equal amounts of paired heavy and light chain plasmids based on the backbone of the pCI-neo vector [30].

Three mAbs, 7B3, 1C11, and 6A6, showed the best neutralization activities with IC50 values of 11.6, 83.3, and 107 ng/mL, respectively; thus, we further analysed these mAbs for epitope identification and in an animal model (Figure 1(B)).

We then measured the neutralization activity of these three representative mAbs against DENV1 and found that mAbs 7B3 and 6A6 showed no DENVI EDIII cross-reactivity and failed to neutralize DENVI virus at 75 \u00b5g/mL, whereas 1C11 showed potent neutralizing activity at an IC50 of 1.72 \u00b5g/mL (Table 1).",

Interestingly, mAb 1C11 binding to E protein was blocked by mAb 7B3 and no other E-targeted mAb, indicating that 7B3 may bind to a broader epitope footprint on EDIII, whereas 1C11 binds to a smaller epitope region that overlaps with the binding region of 7B3.\n",

The SHM rates of these heavy chains compared with their predicted germline sequences were relatively low, at 4.51% for 7B3H, 3.47% for 1C11H, and 4.17% for 6A6H, which is lower than that of antibodies isolated from annual trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) donors [34] and chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 patients (>30%) [27,35]. Compared with their germline sequences, the SHMs of 6A6H were in the CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 regions, whereas SHMs of 1C11H and 7B3 were found sporadically in the CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, and CDR3 regions (Table 2). We paired the heavy chain predicted germline (HGL) of 1C11H (1C11HGL) with the light chain (kappa) of 1C11 (1C11 K) and similarly paired 6A6HGL with 6A6 K and expressed these heavy chain germline-reverted antibodies in HEK-293 cells. These germline-reverted antibodies showed reduced binding activities to E protein at 0.162 \u00b5g/mL for 6A6GL, which is about 10 times lower than that of mature 6A6 (0.0147 \u00b5g/mL), and 31.36 \u00b5g/mL for 1C11GL, which almost completely lost binding ability compared with that of mature 1C11 (0.002 \u00b5g/mL; Table 2).

Neonatal mice treated with mAb 7B3 at either 3, 10 \u00b5g, or 30 \u00b5g 24 h after infection survived the lethal infection (Figure 4(B)). Titration of viral load from brains and spleens collected 12 days after infection revealed a dose-dependent decrease in viral RNA in mice treated with mAb 7B3, whereas mice that received no treatment had much higher viral RNA levels in the brain and spleen (Figure 4(C and D)). Treatment with 30 \u00b5g mAb 7B3 resulted in the best protection, with no detectable viral RNA in the brain and spleen. We also demonstrated in subsequent experiments that ZIKV-infected neonatal SCID mice survived and did not exhibit weight loss after treatment with 30 \u00b5g of either mAb 1C11 or 6A6 (Figure 4(E and F)). In a separate experiment, an unrelated mAb, 2G11, which is specific for H7N9 influenza virus, showed no protective effects on ZIKV-infected neonatal SCID mice (data not shown). Therefore, both EDIII-targeted and EDII-targeted mAbs can effectively protect neonatal SCID mice from lethal ZIKV infections.\n",

We characterized the ZIKV E protein epitopes recognized by these mAbs and analysed the SHM pattern. Two of the most potent mAbs, 7B3 and 1C11, are EDIII-targeted and showed neutralizing activities against three different ZIKV strains, including the South American circulating strain (GZ02), African strain (MR766), and American strain (PRVABC59). mAb 7B3 recognized several residues in the LR region of EDIII, and an individual mutation in these residues led to a > 70% decrease in binding activity compared with that of WT prM-E protein. A previous study also demonstrated that an E370 K mutation alone abolished the neutralizing activity of the LR-targeted mAb ZKA190 [39]. Meanwhile, the heavy and light chains of mAb 1C11 were derived from the VH3-23 and VK1-5 germlines, respectively. It has been reported that ZIKV mAbs with VH3-23/VK1-5 paired antibodies are present in five of six people that were sequentially infected with DENV1 and ZIKV; thus, these mAbs were determined as recurrent antibodies that recognize both ZIKV and DENV1 viruses [21]. Our findings, along with observations by other studies [40], suggested that VH3-23 may be preferentially enlisted in response to ZIKV and DENV infections. It is interesting to note that both mAb 7B3 and 1C11 recognized K394 in the LR region of ZIKV EDIII. mAbs reported by others, such as Z004 and Z006, also recognized K394 on ZIKV EDIII or K385 on DENV1 EDIII [21]. Although mAb 1C11 neutralized the African ZIKV strain MR766, another reported mAb, ZIKV-116, that also recognized K394 of the ZIKV E protein and neutralized the H/PF/2013 strain, failed to neutralize the MR766 strain [22]. This difference may because the current ZIKV strains GZ02 and PRVABC59 possess E393 in the EDIII region, whereas African strain MR766 has D393 in the EDIII region. Therefore, K394 in LR region of EDIII appears to be a key target residue for EDIII-targeted antibodies to exert neutralizing activities. mAbs that recognized K394 showed potent in vitro neutralizing activity, supporting the notion that residue K394 is a hotspot for effective neutralizing activity of EDIII-targeted mAbs [21,22,24,41,42].",

            "text": "It is important to note that most reported E-targeted neutralizing mAbs are EDIII-targeted, whereas only a few neutralizing mAbs are EDII-targeted. mAbs showing broad neutralization activities against flaviviruses have been reported to recognize the EDII targeting either the fusion loop epitope (FLE) or EDE regions [33,43]. Antibodies targeting the FLE are conserved among flaviviruses and can bind to ZIKV E protein. It has been reported that FLE-targeted antibodies show poor neutralizing activities but have strong infection enhancement in vitro [44]. Meanwhile, antibodies targeting the EDE show potent neutralizing activities against ZIKV and can protect against ZIKV infection in mouse and rhesus macaque models [45,46]. Notably, mAb 6A6 in our study showed potent neutralizing activities against all three tested ZIKV strains and is likely an EDII-targeted mAb. It also recognized residues D67, K118, and K251 and is similar to the reported EDE-targeted antibody ZIKV-117, which recognizes D67, K118, and Q89 [22]. Both mAbs recognize the same two residues in the EDII region. Structural analysis indicated that mAb ZIKV-117 is cross-linked with E monomers within dimers and neighbouring dimers in the ZIKV particle [22,47]. Therefore, mAb 6A6 may not exhibit the same interaction with the virus particle as ZIKV-117. Recently, another EDE-targeted mAb, ZIKV-195, was reported to neutralize multiple ZIKV strains and recognize residues D67, M68, R73, and K251 in the EDII region [48]; both mAb 6A6 and ZIKV-195 recognize residues D67 and K251. Notably, mAb 6A6, ZIKV-117, and ZIKV-195 were all isolated from memory B cells of ZIKV convalescent patients. It is possible that residues D67, K118, and K251 are hotspots for EDE-targeted neutralizing antibodies. Future structural biology analysis is required to confirm if mAb 6A6 is indeed an EDE-targeted antibody.",

Interestingly, the neutralizing mAbs 7B3, 1C11, and 6A6 had relatively low SHM rates in their VH genes, which is much lower than the antibodies isolated from annual TIV vaccine donors [34] and chronic HIV-1 patients [27,35]. It is possible that when a person is exposed to ZIKV infection, E-targeted antibodies that require low SHM rates to bind and neutralize ZIKV were generated. Even with relatively low SHM rates, these limited mutations appeared essential for conferring binding activities. When the mAbs 1C11 and 6A6 heavy chains were reverted to their predicted germline sequence and paired with their respective mature 1C11 and 6A6 light chains, binding activity to ZIKV E protein was found almost completely impaired and 10 times lower than that of mature 6A6, respectively. Therefore, a few mutations are sufficient but necessary to confer neutralizing activities against ZIKV infection.",

ZIKV infection in WT mice does not result in disease, whereas suckling WT mice are susceptible to infection [49,50]. Mice lacking interferon signalling, such as A129 (type I IFNAR KO) [49], interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3/5/7 triple KO [49], and AG129 (type 1 and type2 IFN KO) [51], are susceptible to ZIKV infection with detectable ZIKV in the brain, spinal cord, and testes; these mice died within 5\u201310 days post-infection. In this study, we developed a SCID Beige suckling mouse model for evaluating the protective ability of mAbs against ZIKV infection. SCID Beige mice are deficient in T, B, and NK cells and are thus more suitable for evaluating the net effect of anti-ZIKV mAbs. ZIKV infection of SCID Beige suckling mice led to neurological symptoms and high viral loads in the brain and spleen, which was eventually lethal. All three mAbs tested (EDIII-targeted mAbs 7B3 and 1C11 and EDII-targeted mAb 6A6) showed protective effects in ZIKV-infected SCID mice. Therefore, nAbs against ZIKV cloned from convalescent patients have the potential to be further developed for treating ZIKV infection.",

Nevertheless, engineering of the mAb Fc fragment to minimize Fc gamma receptor-mediated infection would be beneficial in improving the practical usage of these neutralizing mAbs. Overall, our study findings provided insights into the antibody response after ZIKV infection and demonstrated the potential of mAbs in ZIKV treatment.",
