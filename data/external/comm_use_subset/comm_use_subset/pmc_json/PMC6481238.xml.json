            "text": "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women around the world [1]. It is a highly heterogeneous disease which for decades has been divided into several subgroups according to immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of three receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [2]. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined as lacking expression of ER, PR, and HER2. It accounts for 15\u201320% of all breast cancers and is characterized by enhanced invasiveness and metastatic capacity, young age of onset and poor prognosis [3]. However, even within TNBC patients, distinct response to treatments and prognosis was observed [4]. With the development of molecular profile, four to six distinct subtypes have been defined within TNBC, such as basal-like and claudin-low [5]. Investigators are making more efforts to explore novel biomarkers to clarify the characteristics of TNBC [6].",

In Hahn-Str\u00f6mberg V\u2019s study, they found that CLDN1 rs9869263 genotype was related to risk of colon cancer and polymorphisms in CLDN7 were associated with differentiation and age of colon cancer [14]. Chen et al. reported that CLDN1 rs17501976 polymorphism was significantly associated with a decreased susceptibility to colorectal cancer in a Chinese population [30]. Polymorphisms investigated in our study have never been reported in cancer patients. We first demonstrated that rs10513846 and rs9283658 genotypes were significantly associated with age and grade in TNBC patients. As age and differentiation have been proved to be prognostic factors for breast cancer [31,32], our results indicate the potential role of polymorphisms in CLDN1 as biomarkers for tumor invasion or prognosis.",

CLDN1 can promote or suppress tumor proliferation in different cancers or even in different histological subtypes of the same cancer. The over expression of CLDN1 has been reported to increase cell invasion in colorectal cancer [33] and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) [34]. CLDN1 has long been considered as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. But recently, some studies showed that the expression level of CLDN1 was low in luminal-like and claudin-low breast cancers, while the expression level of CLDN1 was high in basal-like, most ER negative, BRCA1, medullary breast cancers [35]. Whether CLDN1 plays tumor-facilitating role in basal-like breast cancer or TNBC still needs to be proved.",

In our study, no association between polymorphisms in CLDN1 and survival of TNBC patients was observed. There are some explanations. First, the sample size was relatively small and we did not do subgroup analysis. Second, though polymorphisms in CLDN1 might influence the expression level of CLDN1 protein, the complex interactions between CLDN family members could also affect the results. By using STRING, we found that CLDN1 interacts with some other proteins in CLDN family, such as CLDN2, CLDN3, CLDN6, CLDN12 and so on (Figure 1). CLDN 12 expression could be clinically useful for predicting the survival of the ER-negative subgroup of patients with breast cancer [38]. High expression of CLDN6 confers chemoresistance on breast cancer [39]. So, combination analysis of CLDN1 and other related proteins might help us to better understand the role of CLDN1 in TNBC.",

In hepatocellular cancer, down-regulation of CLDN1 was associated with poor differentiation [41]. In basal-like breast cancer patients, the highest level of CLDN1 protein expression was observed in patients who were older than 55 years of age [42]. So, we assume that polymorphisms in CLDN1 might influence the expression level of CLDN1 protein and then influence the tumor differentiation. However, the underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated. Our results also suggested that polymorphisms in CLDN1 might help us to identify subtypes of TNBC, as TNBC patients with different age and grade were proved to have unique molecular features [32,43].",
