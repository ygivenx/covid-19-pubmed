The coronaviruses all possess a common ancestor and four different genera (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) that collectively use at least four different glycoproteins and acetylated sialic acids as host receptors or attachment factors have evolved3\u20135. Four coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 circulate in the human population and collectively they are responsible for a significant percentage of the common cold as well as more severe respiratory disease in vulnerable populations6, 7. HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are both alphacoronaviruses and although closely related, they have evolved to use two different receptors, aminopeptidase N (APN) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), respectively8, 9. The more distantly related betacoronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, are less well characterized and although HCoV-OC43 uses 9-O-acetylsialic acid as its receptor10, the receptor for HCoV-HKU1 has not yet been determined11\u201313. Recent zoonotic transmission of betacoronaviruses from bats is responsible for SARS and MERS, and in these cases infection is associated with much more serious disease and high rates of mortality14\u201316. Like HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV uses ACE217 as its receptor and the observation that MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 418 highlights the fact that coronaviruses with new receptor specificities continue to arise.",

A host-elicited immune response, the introduction of antiviral drugs, and the transmission to a new species provide important examples of environmental change35. Nevertheless, the means by which random mutations lead to viral variants with increased fitness and enhanced survival in the new environment are not well characterized. Given their wide host range, diverse receptor usage and ongoing zoonotic transmission to humans, the coronaviruses provide an important system for studying RNA virus adaptation and evolution. The alphacoronavirus, HCoV-229E, is particularly valuable as it circulates in the human population and a sequence database of natural variants isolated over the past fifty years is available.

The structure shows that receptor binding is mediated solely by three extended loops, a feature shared by HCoV-NL63 and the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus, PRCoV. It also shows that the HCoV-229E RBD binds at a site on hAPN that differs from the site where the PRCoV RBD binds on porcine APN (pAPN), evidence of an ability of the RBD to acquire novel receptor interactions. Remarkably, we find that the natural HCoV-229E sequence variation observed over the past fifty years is highly skewed to the receptor-binding loops. Moreover, we find that the loop variation defines six RBD classes (Classes I\u2013VI) whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population. These RBD classes differ in their affinity for hAPN and their ability to be bound by a neutralizing antibody elicited by the HCoV-229E reference strain (Class I). Taken together, our results provide a model for alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution stemming from the use of extended loops for receptor binding.",

            "text": "The HCoV-229E RBD is an elongated six-stranded \u03b2-structural domain with three extended loops (loop 1: residues 308\u2013325, loop 2: residues 352\u2013359, loop 3: residues 404\u2013408) at one end that exclusively mediate the interaction with hAPN (Fig. 2b). Loop 1 is the longest and it contributes ~70% of the RBD surface buried on complex formation (Figs. 2c and 3g). Within loop 1, residues Cys317 and Cys320 form a disulfide bond that makes a stacking interaction with the side chains of hAPN residues Tyr289 and Glu291 (Fig. 2c). The C317S/C320S RBD double mutant showed no binding to hAPN at concentrations up to 15 \u03bcM (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1D, and Supplementary Table 1), evidence of the importance of the stacking interaction and a likely role for the disulfide bond in defining the conformation of loop 1. Notably, loop 1 contains three tandemly repeated glycine residues (residues 313\u2013315) whose NH groups donate hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Asp288 and the carbonyl oxygen of Phe287 of hAPN (Fig. 2c); mutation of hAPN residue Asp288 to alanine leads to a ~10-fold reduction in affinity (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 2A, and Supplementary Table 1). Apolar interactions between RBD residues Cys317 and Phe318 and hAPN residues Tyr289, Val290, Ile309, Ala310, and Leu318 are also observed (Fig. 2c); mutation of RBD residue Phe318 leads to a 13-fold reduction in affinity while mutation of hAPN residues Tyr289, Val290, Ile309, and Leu318 lead to a 10- to 30-fold reduction in affinity (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. 2B\u2013E, and Supplementary Table 1). Centered in the contact area between the RBD and hAPN is a hydrogen bond between the side chain of RBD residue Asn319 and the carbonyl oxygen of hAPN residue Glu291 (Fig. 2c); mutation of RBD residue Asn319 to alanine also ablates binding at the highest concentrations achievable (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1E, and Supplementary Table 1). The remaining loop 1 residues serve to satisfy most of the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor pairs of the edge \u03b2-strand on subdomain 2 of the hAPN molecule. Most prominent of the remaining RBD\u2013hAPN interactions is the salt bridge between loop 2 residue Arg359 and hAPN residue Asp315 and the interactions made by loop 3 residues Trp404 and Ser407 with hAPN residues Asp315 and Lys292 (Fig. 2c); the importance of Trp404 of loop 3 is evidenced by the fact that mutating it also ablates binding (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1F, and Supplementary Table 1).\n",

As our complex shows, HCoV-229E binds at a site on hAPN (H-site) that differs from the site on pAPN (P-site) used by PRCoV (Fig. 3a, b). Glu291 in hAPN, a residue in the hAPN\u2013RBD interface, is an N-glycosylated asparagine (Asn286) in pAPN and attempts to dock the HCoV-229E RBD at the H-site on pAPN leads to a steric clash with the N-glycan (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Consistent with this observation, the HCoV-229E RBD cannot bind to a mutant form of hAPN (E291N/K292E/Q293T) that possesses an N-glycan at position 291, as we have shown (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 4A\u2013C). Attempts to dock the PRCoV RBD at the P-site on hAPN also leads to a steric clash, in this case with hAPN residue Arg741 (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Notably, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) can bind hAPN, and HCoV-229E can bind mouse APN, once the Arg side chain (on hAPN) and the N-glycan (on mouse APN) on the respective APNs have been mutated41. Across species, the sequence identity at the H- and P-sites is only ~60% (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3C) and the receptor-binding loops of these viruses must be accommodating the remaining APN structural differences on receptors from species that they do not infect. Together these results provide evidence that the extended receptor-binding loops of these alphacoronaviruses possess conformational plasticity.",

The HCoV-229E RBD binds to hAPN in its closed conformation and structural comparison shows that the H-site does not differ between the open and closed conformations. This is to be contrasted with the P-site of pAPN that differs in the open and closed conformations. Indeed, the PRCoV RBD has recently been shown to bind to pAPN in the open conformation as a result of P-site interactions made possible in the open form42. These differences in binding and receptor conformation are reflected in the fact that enzyme inhibitors that promote the closed conformation of APN block TGEV infection42, but not HCoV-229E infection8, and the fact that the PRCoV S-protein42, but not HCoV-229E43, inhibits APN catalytic activity.",

Moreover, for the eight variants where full genome sequences were reported, the receptor-binding loops represent the location at which the greatest variation in the entire genome is observed (Fig. 4c). Analysis of the HCoV-229E RBD\u2013hAPN interface further shows that of the 16 RBD surface residues that are fully or partially buried on complex formation, 10 of them vary in at least one of the 52 sequences analyzed and a pairwise comparison of the sequences suggests that many of these positions can vary simultaneously (Supplementary Fig. 5). Finally, we show that the six invariant interface residues on the RBD (Gly313, Gly315, Cys317, Cys320, Asn319, and Arg359) constitute only 45% of the viral surface area buried, the very region expected to be the most highly conserved from a receptor-binding standpoint.

            "text": "Phylogenetic analysis of the HCoV-229E RBD sequences found in the database showed that they segregate into six classes (Supplementary Fig. 6). Class I contains the ATCC-740 reference strain (originally isolated in 1967 and deposited in 1973) and related lab strains, while Classes II\u2013VI, represent clinical isolates that have successively replaced each other in the human population over time since the 1970s. To characterize these classes, a representative sequence from each was selected; for Class I, the RBD of the reference strain, also used in our structural analysis, was selected. To simplify characterization, the RBDs of the other five classes were synthesized with the Class I sequence in all but the loop regions (Fig. 4d). As observed for Class I, the other RBDs do not bind to the hAPN mutant that introduces an N-glycan at Glu291 (Supplementary Fig. 4D), an observation suggesting that they all bind at the same site on hAPN. The RBDs bound hAPN with an ~16-fold range in affinity (K\nd from ~30 to ~440 nM). These differences in affinity are largely a result of differences in k\noff with little difference in k\non (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, the Class I RBD binds with the lowest affinity, while the RBDs from viral classes that have emerged most recently (Class V: viruses isolated in 2001\u20132004 and Class VI: viruses isolated in 2007\u20132015) bind with the highest affinity. For each of the six classes, Supplementary Table 2 shows the identity of the loop residues that have shown variation. Of those buried in the RBD\u2013hAPN interface, residues 314, 404, and 407 are particularly noteworthy as they undergo considerable variation in amino-acid character. Residue 314, for example, accounts for 9% of the total buried surface area on complex formation and changes from Gly to Val to Pro in the transition from Classes I to VI. Variation of this sort provides insight into how changes in receptor-binding affinity might be mediated during the process of viral adaptation.\n",

To this end, we have delimited the HCoV-229E RBD and determined its X-ray structure in complex with the ectodomain of its receptor, hAPN. We found that three extended loops on the RBD are solely responsible for receptor binding, and that these loops are highly variable among viruses isolated over the past 50 years. A phylogenetic analysis also showed that the RBDs of these viruses define six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population. The six RBDs differ in their receptor-binding affinity and their ability to be bound by a neutralizing antibody (9.8E12) and taken together, our findings suggest that the HCoV-229E sequence variation observed arose through adaptation and selection.",

Loop-binding neutralizing antibodies are elicited by the alphacoronavirus TGEV40, and the receptor-binding loops of HCoV-229E mediate the binding of the neutralizing antibody, 9.8E12. As shown by the sequences of the viral isolates analyzed, the RBDs differ almost exclusively in their receptor-binding loops. 9.8E12 blocks the hAPN\u2013RBD interaction and it can only bind to the RBD (Class I) found in the virus that elicited it. This observation shows that loop variability can abrogate neutralizing antibody binding. Indeed, the successive replacement or ladder-like phylogeny observed, when the sequence of the HCoV-229E RBD is analyzed, is characteristic of immune escape as shown by the influenza virus45, 46. Taken together, our results suggest that immune evasion contributes to if not explains the extensive receptor-binding loop variation shown by HCoV-229E over the past 50 years. HCoV-229E infection in humans does not provide protection against different isolates37, and viruses that contain a new RBD class that cannot be bound by the existing repertoire of loop-binding neutralizing antibodies provide an explanation for this observation. Neutralizing antibodies that block receptor binding can also be thwarted by an increase in the affinity/avidity between the virus and its host receptor. Increased receptor-binding affinity/avidity allows the virus to more effectively compete with receptor blocking neutralizing antibodies, a mechanism thought to be important for evading a polyclonal antibody response47. In addition, an optimal receptor binding affinity is thought to exist in a given environment. As such, adaptation in a new species, changes in tissue tropism, and differences in receptor expression levels can all lead to changes in receptor binding affinity29, 31, 48. Taken together, the observation that the most recent RBD classes (Class V: viruses isolated in 2001\u20132004 and Class VI: viruses isolated in 2007\u20132015) show a ~16-fold increase in affinity for hAPN over that of Class I (viruses isolated in 1967) merits further study.",

Although the ramifications of this structural arrangement are not yet clear, restricting access to the binding site has been proposed to provide a means of limiting B-cell receptor interactions against the receptor-binding site23. How this might work in mechanistic terms is also not clear given the need to bind receptor. However, in a simple model, the inaccessible S-protein conformation(s) would be in equilibrium with a less stable (higher energy) but accessible S-protein conformation(s). The energy difference between these conformations is a barrier to binding that decreases equally the intrinsic free energy of binding of both the viral receptor and the B-cell receptor and relative binding energies may be the key. Both soluble hAPN and antibody 9.8E12 can inhibit HCoV\u2013229E infection in a cell-based assay, an indication that their binding energies (K\nd of 430 and 66 nM, respectively) are sufficient to efficiently overcome the barrier to binding. However, B-cell receptors bind their antigens relatively weakly prior to affinity maturation49 and they would be much less able to do so. The dynamics of the interconversion between accessible and inaccessible conformations may also be a factor in the recognition of inaccessible antibody epitopes50, 51, and further work will be required to establish if and how restricting access to the receptor binding site enhances coronavirus fitness. The cryoEM structures also show that the receptor-binding loops make intra- and inter-subunit contacts in the inaccessible prefusion trimer. This suggests the intriguing possibility that the magnitude of the energy barrier, or the dynamics of the interconversion between accessible and inaccessible conformations, might be modulated by loop variation during viral adaption.",

Such loops can tolerate insertions, deletions, and amino acid substitutions relatively free of the energetic penalties associated with the mutation of other protein structural elements. Indeed, our analysis of the six RBD classes shows that the receptor-binding loops possess a remarkable ability to both accommodate and accumulate mutational change while maintaining receptor binding. Among the six classes, 73% of the loop residues show change and only 45% of the receptor interface buried on receptor binding has been conserved. As we have shown, variation in the receptor-binding loops can abrogate neutralizing antibody binding and it will also increase the likelihood of acquiring new receptor interactions by chance. In this way, the selection of viral variants capable of immune evasion and/or cross-species transmission will be facilitated27, 28, 52\u201354.",

By a similar reasoning, the use of conserved receptor interactions requiring little optimization would facilitate large species jumps.
