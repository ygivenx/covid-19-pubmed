First, the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae infection is associated with amplified host immune response and virulence of M. pneumoniae [5]. Second, adverse effects of glucocorticoids have been well established. Further risk is not likely to be added in the treatment of MRMP.

            "text": "M. pneumoniae is a common pathogen causing community acquired pneumonia. The clinical course of M. pneumoniae infection is diverse, ranging from self-limiting to severe pneumonia with extra-pulmonary complications [36]. Macrolide is considered the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection [37]. In adults, one study reported that prednisone treatment for 7 days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to hospital can shorten time to clinical stability without increase in complications [38]. However, another study reported that glucocorticoid use did not show any benefits in children [8]. Pulmonary injury associated with severe mycoplasma pneumonia could be caused by host immune response rather than by direct microbial damage [39, 40]. Overly active cell-mediated immunity and cytokine responses play a significant role in MRMP [41]. Severe M. pneumoniae infections and MRMP show similar laboratory findings with severe acute respiratory syndrome such as increased levels of non-specific markers of inflammation such as serum CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer [42]. Since MRMP can be considered as an immune-mediated disease, use of immune modulatory therapy could seem rational. For cases with MRMP infection, secondary treatment options are limited due to adverse effects of tetracycline or fluoroquinolones, especially in children [43]. The use of systemic steroids, in addition to antimicrobial therapy, to diminish host immune response in MRMP has been used in children and demonstrated satisfactory effects [7, 8, 14]. Glucocorticoids have shown to improve clinical features and reduce lung injury in children and adults [5, 44, 45]. The use of glucocorticoids in M. pneumoniae infection showed reduced lung histopathologic score by reducing cytokines and decreasing inflammatory response ultimately leading to lower mortality [5, 44, 45]. Therefore, glucocorticoids have been considered suitable as adjunctive therapy to macrolide therapy. Although previous studies have reported the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of severe MRMP, treatment protocols varied from oral prednisolone of 1 mg/kg/day to intravenous methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days [7, 17]. These variable treatment protocols are due to the lack of guidelines for glucocorticoids treatment in severe MRMP to date [7, 46].",
