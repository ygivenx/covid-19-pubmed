            "text": "The critical roles of LT\u03b2R in the development and maintenance of peripheral lymphoid organs were illustrated in LT\u03b2R-deficient mice two decades ago [3]. Over the past twenty years, LT\u03b2R signaling has been reported to be crucially involved in many cellular processes and molecular events. The activation of LT\u03b2R by functional antibodies induces nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB)-dependent interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) secretion in mouse fibrosarcoma cells [4]. Signaling by lymphotoxin \u03b11\u03b22 via LT\u03b2R is an essential prerequisite for the containment of intracellular pathogens, as LT\u03b2R knockout mice exhibit significantly higher numbers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in infected lungs, and these genetically modified mice are substantially more susceptible than wild-type mice to intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with Listeria monocytogenes [5]. In addition to the critical role of LT\u03b2R in protection against infection, the involvement of LT\u03b2R in the regulation of the microbial community composition has been reported [6]. Specifically, LT\u03b2R knockout mice are resistant to high-fat-diet induced obesity and exhibit an overgrowth of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) due to lacking IL-22 and IL-23 [6]. Recent studies have found the link between LT\u03b2R signaling and oncogenic protein kinase B, also named as AKT, in hepatitis and liver tumorigenesis, demonstrating that the activation of LT\u03b2R rapidly accelerates the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression initiated by the AKT/Notch signaling pathway [7]. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LT\u03b2R have been reported to be associated with the spontaneous resolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a Chinese population [8].",

In addition, it has been demonstrated that LT\u03b2R signaling in intestinal epithelial cells is essential for epithelial IL-23 production and protection against epithelial injury [10]. The study of macrophage/neutrophil LT\u03b2R-specific knockout mice, which were generated by the flox/LysM-cre system, suggested that LT\u03b2R activation on macrophages by the T-cell derived lymphotoxin \u03b11\u03b22 controls proinflammatory responses via the tripartite-motif protein 30\u03b1 (TRIM30\u03b1) pathway to protect against exacerbating inflammatory reactions [11].",

Severe outbreaks of PEDV infections were reported in China in 2010 [13] and in North America in 2013 [14], leading to high mortality among infected piglets and huge economic losses. Epithelial cells provide the first line of defense against mucosal pathogens, and IPEC-J2 cells and LT\u03b2R signaling in intestinal epithelial cells are required for the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection during early infection via the production of the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) and CXCL2 [15]. However, the importance of LT\u03b2R in the regulation of PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells is currently unknown. In this study, we generated LT\u03b2R knockout cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique and investigated the effect of LT\u03b2R on IPEC-J2 cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. More specifically, the impact of LT\u03b2R on PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells was also investigated. ",

Herein, we showed that LT\u03b2R is ubiquitously expressed in all sections of gut tissues from adult pigs, indicating its potential function in the intestine. Specifically, LT\u03b2R expression was significantly lower in the duodenum than in other intestinal sections. Therefore, we used IPEC-J2 cells, a non-transformed, non-tumorigenic porcine cell line derived from jejunal intestinal regions, to investigate the effects of LT\u03b2R on cell proliferation, apoptosis and viral infection.",

In this study, we successfully generated LT\u03b2R null cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, as evidenced by the low expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. The gene targeting efficiency was determined, and the biallelic mutated clone reached 10.4%. Further, our data showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in LT\u03b2R null cells, suggesting that LT\u03b2R-mediated signaling is required to maintain IPEC-J2 cell proliferation. In agreement with this result, the increased viability of LIGHT-stimulated human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) was observed [24]. Cell proliferation is closely associated with the cell cycle. We performed cell cycle analysis with both cell lines using propidium iodide staining, and the ablation of LT\u03b2R prevents cells from completing the G2/S phase transition, so the cells in the S phase significantly increased. Consistent with these results, expression levels of the S phase marker cyclin E1 were high in LT\u03b2R null cells. From these results, we speculate that LT\u03b2R knockout prevents cells from exiting the S phase, which leads to growth inhibition in IPEC-J2 cells.",

Compared to other strategies that measure cell death and apoptosis, such as the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, digital holographic microscopy allows the visualization of real-time morphological alterations in cells and has become a powerful tool for the evaluation of cell responses to various stimuli with no labeling required [20]. The 3D images allowed the visualization of apoptotic cells, and the number of tall cells was increased in the LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 cell population, indicating that more LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 cells than LT\u03b2R+/+ cells underwent apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed that the apoptotic-related genes TNFSF10 and CASP3 were significantly increased in LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 cells, further confirming that the knockout of LT\u03b2R induced the apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells. Interestingly, in contrast from our observations, Wu et al. reported that the overexpression of either LT\u03b2R or the cytoplasmic domain of LT\u03b2R induces apoptosis in HeLa cells [26]. This opposite observation might be due to the distinct role of LT\u03b2R in different cell types.",

            "text": "LT\u03b2R signaling has been reported to be crucially involved in many cellular processes and molecular events, and we are particularly interested in its role in bacterial and viral infection. Several reports have demonstrated the critical role of LT\u03b2R signaling in bacterial infection of intestinal epithelial cells. For example, LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 mice are sensitive to bacterial infection due to the absence of lymphoid organs in these mice, and LT\u03b2R signaling in intestinal epithelial cells is required for the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection during early infection via the production of CXCL1 and CXCL2 [6,27]. LT\u03b2R signaling is required for clearance of Salmonella typhimurium in infected gut lumen [28]. Additionally, very recent data showed that LT\u03b2R is highly expressed in the lymph nodes, duodenum and jejunum of eight-day-old newborn piglets, which may be beneficial for developing resistance to E. coli F18 in pigs [21]. In addition, the role of LT\u03b2R in viral infection was investigated. Zhu et al. reported that the LT\u03b2R rs12345 polymorphism is related to the spontaneous resolution of hepatitis B virus infection [8]. All these observations revealed the function of LT\u03b2R in infection. Since IPEC-J2 cells have been reported to be susceptible to PEDV infection [22], we investigated the impact of LT\u03b2R on PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. Our data revealed that the levels of PED virus in LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 cells was significantly higher than in LT\u03b2R+/+ cells, indicating that LT\u03b2R-mediated signaling plays a key role in protecting IPEC-J2 cells from PEDV infection.",

VCAM1 and IL-22 were significantly decreased in RNA expression in LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 IPEC-J2 cells, in agreement with the previous observation that an abundance of IL-22 is significantly reduced in LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat-diet [6]. IL-22, a member of the IL-10 superfamily, plays essential roles in fighting against mucosal microbial infection and maintaining mucosal barrier integrity within the intestine. The downregulation of IL-22 and VCAM1 in LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 IPEC-J2 cells indicates that the epithelial barrier integrity of cells might be impaired, which leads to increased susceptibility to PEDV infection, though further investigation is needed. Surprisingly, IL-23 was found to be intact in LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 cells, which suggested that IL-22 and IL-23 may play individual roles in IPEC-J2 cells. In addition, the S-phase arrest might also contribute to the higher viral production in LT\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 cells. The overexpression of LT\u03b2R, or the activation of its mediated signaling by its functional antibody or cellular receptors such as LIGHT, will also be needed to positively determine its role in preventing infection.
