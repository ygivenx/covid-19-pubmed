FmoPV is genetically most closely related to viruses such as canine distemper virus (CDV), measles virus (MV), rinderpest virus (RPV), peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV), phocine distemper virus (PDV) and cetacean morbillivirus (CMV), belonging to the genus morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae [1\u20135]. FmoPV showed genetic diversity among isolates [3\u20135], and a natural recombination in the envelope protein region between viruses in different clades was also found [4]. In Germany, three groups of feline paramyxoviruses (FPaV) have been detected, and these were associated with feline chronic kidney diseases (CKD) including lower urinary tract diseases (LUTD) [5]. Phylogenetically, the first group of these viruses belongs to the same cluster of FmoPV with 99 % homology, whereas the second group represents a new cluster between FmoPV and other morbilliviruses. The third group represents a group that is distinct from FmoPV and other morbilliviruses. A seroepidemiological survey of CDV infection in Asian countries showed that domestic cats were susceptible to CDV infection, but CDV was not virulent in domestic cats [9]. At the moment, it is not yet confirmed that FmoPV is classified in the genus morbillivirus or in a novel genus separate from the genus morbillivirus.",

It can be divided into acute kidney disease (AKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), or inherent kidney disease and acquired kidney disease [10\u201313]. AKD, which could be caused by toxins, trauma, infection, shock, blockage of the blood flow and heart failure [11], is reversible and can affect cats of all ages. CKD affects domestic cats, especially middle-aged or older cats [14], and its prevalence increases according to age, affecting up to half of cats older than 15 years [14]. CKD could result from infection, blockages, dental disease, high blood pressure and cancer. In particular, idiopathic CKD such as pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) due to unknown causes has been reported extensively [10, 11, 15\u201317]. It is suspected that FmoPV is one of the causative agents of CKD [1, 5], such as chronic TIN. Therefore, it is important to clarify the characteristics or the pathogenicity of FmoPV and the pathogenesis in domestic cats as the natural host. In this respect, large-scale epidemiological investigation is considered to be indispensable.",

A large band was consistent with the predicted size of the FmoPV-N, while a small one is thought to be N-terminal truncated FmoPV-N, since both of them were purified by Ni-NTA agarose chromatography. Since FmoPV-positive cat serum reacted to both two bands in immunoblot, N-terminal truncated FmoPV-N was considered to be immunogenic. The purified FmoPV-N protein was subcutaneously injected into three rabbits five times. When the serum antibody titers by IF test reached above 1:10,000, the rabbits were euthanized and the sera were collected.

FmoPV-infected cats in the present study were divided into three groups: RNA+/Ab+, RNA+/Ab- and RNA-/Ab+. Cats in the RNA+/Ab- group were considered to be in an acute phase of FmoPV infection. Cats in the RNA+/Ab + group were considered to be in either a subacute or a chronic phase of the infection. Since it is not confirmed that the nested R-PCR used in the present study detected all the FmoPV strains because of the genetic diversity of the viruses, thus it is possible that there are some false negative results in the RT-PCR. Since humoral immune response in addition to cellular immune response to the virus are thought to eliminate the virus from animals, cats in the RNA-/Ab + group were considered to be in a convalescent phase. Consequently, it appears that FmoPV could establish as an acute, subacute or chronic infection, and could be eliminated. Additionally, there were cases in which RNA of FmoPV was negative in urine but positive in renal tissues. Since approximately half of the infected cats (14 out of the 29 infected cats) were positive for viral RNA and Ab, it seems likely that cats are easily chronically or persistently infected with the virus. However, further long-term follow-up studies in FmoPV-infected cats are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.",

The infection rate of FmoPV was significantly high in unneutered male cats (P < 0.005) in this study (Fig. 6). These tendencies could be due to differences of behavior patterns, such as more aggressive or active behavior in unneutered male cats than neutered male cats and female cats, and such behavior might result in an increase in opportunity of infection with FmoPV from other infected cats. The transmission of FmoPV between cats could occur in veterinary hospitals, boarding kennels, breeding facilities, outdoors or at home. Given the high positive rate, it seemed that FmoPV might be maintained between their transmissible cats for a long time.\n",

Consequently, no meaningful direct relationship between infection by FmoPV and chronic TIN was confirmed in this study. It might be plausible that FmoPV antigens in the lesions were already eliminated by host immune responses in the case of severe chronic TIN. A similar phenomenon was reported in other virus infectious diseases such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [19, 20]. In these cases, uncontrolled responses in cytokines and chemokines are considered to be responsible for the pathogenesis.
