            "text": "Cryptococcosis is the leading cause of meningitis in adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa1,2. In 2008, the number of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) cases in this region was estimated to be 720,000 (range 144,000\u20131.3 million)3. Recent estimates from 2014 indicate that over 160,000 (95%CI 113,600\u2013193,900) cases of CM, including more than 130,000 deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa4. This significant decrease in the absolute number of cases from 2008 to 2014 seems to be related to the scale-up of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART)5. However, the proportion of AIDS-related deaths due to Cryptococcus remains similar (around 15%), representing the second most common cause of AIDS-related mortality in adults, after tuberculosis4. Cryptococcal infection is believed to be acquired by inhalation of fungal cells from the environment. In immunocompetent hosts, the pathogen can be cleared or establish a latent infection6. In immunocompromised patients, Cryptococcus may induce pneumonia and its dissemination to the central nervous system (CNS) causes meningitis, the most severe form of the infection, which is fatal without appropriate treatment. In low income countries, the one-year mortality of CM, even in HIV-infected patients in care, has been estimated to be as high as 70%4.",

Cryptococcus gattii is further divided into four molecular types (variety gattii; VGI-VGIV) and little is known about C.gatti infections in Africa, where this pathogen has been isolated from both clinical and environmental samples8. Most VGIV strains have been described in the southern part of Africa, whereas VGI and VGII strains have been reported in central Africa8. C. gattii infections were thought to occur mainly in the tropics9 until 2004, when an outbreak of C. gattii in North America was recognized10. This outbreak was caused by VGII strains and included the emergence of hypervirulent variants11. Current knowledge on the epidemiology and clinical presentation of C. neoformans infection is clearly greater than that related to C. gattii. C. neoformans infections occur predominantly in people infected with HIV or with other immunocompromising conditions, whereas C. gattii infections have been mainly described in apparently immunocompetent patients9. Autopsy findings reveal that the CNS and the lungs are the organs most frequently affected in disseminated infections12,13, which may also affect multiple organs, especially in HIV-infected patients14. However, reported autopsy series do not usually include cryptococcal species identification, and therefore, knowledge regarding the histopathology of C. gattii remains limited.",

Sixty-one cases were recruited from Brazil: 59 adults (38 males and 21 females, including one maternal death) and two children. A description of the study design and inclusion criteria for the cases has been published elsewhere16\u201318. All cases fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the study; these were (1) a CDA requested by the clinician as part of the medical evaluation of the patient and; (2) a verbal informed consent to perform the autopsy given by the relatives. Traumatic deaths were excluded. A member of the study staff was tasked with liaising with the families in cases of deaths occurring in the pediatric department, but only after the clinicians had asked for consent for postmortem examination17. All the clinical records available regarding admission preceding death of each patient were reviewed and the clinical data were collected in a standardized manner.",
