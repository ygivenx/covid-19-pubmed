When cultured under appropriate conditions in vitro, this population of tumor cells gives rise to gliomaspheres, referred to more generically as tumorspheres (TSs). TSs have been isolated from various malignant tumors, including breast [4], prostate [5], bone [6], colon [7], kidney [8] and lung [9], as well as brain [3, 10\u201314]. It was previously reported that the rate of isolation of TSs increase as the World Health Organization (WHO) grades of glioma rise [3]. Moreover, it is not possible to isolate TSs from GBM specimens in all cases, with reported isolation rates estimated at 43.8 % [3]. Notably, the ability to isolate TSs is a significant prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with primary GBM [15].",

Primary antibodies against CD133 and nestin were detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (1:2000; Invitrogen), which is spectrally similar to Cy3. The cells were mounted with Vectashield H-1200 mounting media containing 4\u20326-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) to counterstain nuclei. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Dawinbio Inc, Hanam, Korea) was used for all washing steps, and antibody diluent reagent solution (Invitrogen) was used to dilute antibodies. As a negative control, only the secondary antibody was used. A fluorescence microscope (1 \u00d7 71; Olympus Korea, Seoul, Korea) and DP Controller software (Olympus Korea) were used for observing and photographing the cells.",

This suggested the related hypothesis that a larger specimen mass would tend to favor an increased TS isolation rate.

However, some authors have described sequential modifications of isolation techniques that improved efficiency from 40 to 90 % in GBM patients [18]. In this latter case, improvements in TS isolation involved fixes to technical problems associated with each stage, such as early vulnerability of surgical specimens, mechanical disruption, and removal of red blood cells and necrotic material from fresh specimens. Although studies such as this highlight the contribution of technical problems to the isolation of TSs, the fact that the ability to isolate TSs is correlated with poorer clinical outcome in various types of cancers [3, 15, 29\u201333] indicates that success of TS isolation is not solely determined by technical issues.",

In addition, some authors described that TSs isolation is supposed to be a poor prognostic factor in other malignant gliomas [34]. In the current study, we evaluated the prognostic role of TSs in WHO grade IV gliomas. TS isolation from WHO grade IV gliomas were not significantly related to overall survival (data not shown), and there were no significant differences in clinical characteristics, molecular factors, or pathological features between TS-positive and TS-negative groups (Table 1). However, these results could be related to the short follow-up period (10 month), suggesting that long-term follow-up of this cohort is needed to assess the prognostic role of TS isolation in patients with WHO grade IV gliomas.",

Some authors have reported that surgical procedures can help TSs exit from quiescence, inducing the formation of more TSs for analysis consequently [19]. On the other hand, surgically resected tissue is vulnerable to rapid ischemic and degenerative alterations [7, 19]. Thus, optimal conditions, including rapid transfer of specimens following surgical resection, removal of red blood cells and necrotic material and an appropriate environment for growth are required for the isolation of TSs from fresh surgical specimens [5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 18, 19, 23, 35]. Our laboratory has an ongoing effort to develop optimal conditions for the isolation of TS [2, 3, 10, 17].",

This result was a little similar to the value reported by other authors [11]. Ideally, specimens would be subdivided into various sizes and then cultured, or more than one specimen would be procured from a single patient. However, in actual practice, the operating room setting imposes limitations on specimen collection. We tried to collect specimens with a minimum of red blood cells and necrotic material, but this made it difficult to gather specimens of different sizes from each patient. Therefore, we emphasized the absence of significant differences between demographic and clinical characteristics of two groups, and used the ROC curve for statistical processing. An analysis of our data yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.618, which demonstrated poor discriminatory ability for the isolation of TSs [37, 38]. However, 500 mg of fresh specimen proved to be optimal in our study, and our summary data showed no significant difference in weight between the TS-positive and TS-negative groups, clearly ruling out size/weight of sample as a determining factor in successful TS isolation. Our study suggests some methods for improving the efficiency of TS isolation in addition to stage-specific technical modifications. Future studies using a larger numbers of cases are warranted to further address the relationship between the amount of fresh specimen and TS isolation rate.",
