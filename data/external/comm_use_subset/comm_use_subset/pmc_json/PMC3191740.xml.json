Adenoviruses, coronaviruses, human enteroviruses (HEV), human rhinoviruses (HRV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are well-known causes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in both industrialized and developing countries. Over the last decade, modern molecular techniques have led to the discovery of several previously unknown respiratory tract viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [1], two new human coronavirus types [2, 3], human bocavirus (HBoV) [4], and two new human polyomaviruses [5, 6]. The significance of these novel viruses has been reviewed recently [7, 8].",

For the detection of influenza A and B viruses, RSV, PIV 1, 2, and 3, and cDNA were amplified in two separate real-time multiplex PCRs [20] with minor modifications. Other, slightly modified real-time PCRs were used for the detection of influenza A subtypes H1 and H3 (R. Fouchier, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, personal communication), influenza C (L. P. Nielsen, Copenhagen, Denmark, personal communication), bocavirus [21], metapneumovirus [22], and adenovirus [23]. Real-time RT-PCR for the detection of HRV was performed as described [24] and of enteroviruses (HEV) according to the method by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA (W.A. Nix and D.R. Kilpatrick, personal communication). We know that the HEV test is not 100% specific but also reacts with some HRV strains (Savolainen-Kopra et al., unpublished results). Therefore, specimens yielding a positive result in the HEV test were divided into two groups, and a designated \u201ctrue HEV\u201d result was scored only for those HEV-positive specimens that were negative in the HRV test.",

All viruses investigated, including the more recently discovered HMPV and HBoV, were present in at least some of the specimens. This wide variety is somewhat surprising because the specimens have been collected only during a four-month period, mostly in the dry season of the year. It is known from the previous studies that circulation of some viruses is at a low level during the dry season [25\u201327]. Seventy-seven percent of the children harboured at least one viral pathogen in their samples. This figure is relatively high taking in account that we did not have the possibility to test the specimens for human coronaviruses, and comparable to [28] or higher than in some recent similar studies performed elsewhere [29\u201331]. Human rhinoviruses and PIV were the two most frequently detected virus groups. Simultaneous infections with two or even three viruses were also found, similar to observations by others in comparable studies [9, 25]. ",
