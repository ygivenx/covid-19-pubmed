            "text": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become a valuable tool in virology studies and has the power to generate whole genome sequences (WGS) from small amounts of virus, rapidly and at a relatively low cost [1]. Although direct WGS of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has been reported [2], viral RNA amounts in clinical samples are usually too low for direct WGS. Amplification of the nucleic acid is usually required and sequence-dependent and independent methods are available. A common method for amplifying viral RNA is RT-PCR using virus specific primers. This method is, however, cumbersome due to the requirement of multiple sets of primers to cover the full viral genome. Sequence-independent methods are attractive in that they allow sequencing of highly divergent viruses, but efficient reduction of background nucleic acids is required in order to get good coverage and depth (number of times each nucleotide is sequenced) of the viral genomes [3]. Using standard Sanger sequencing only the dominating strain(s) is(are) sequenced. In contrast, NGS yields deep sequencing meaning that each nucleotide in the sample is sequenced several times. While standard sequencing misses allelic variants with a frequency below 20% in a population [4], NGS can detect less abundant variants depending on sequencing depth. This provides an increased opportunity for viral metagenomics (study of the total viral community), for epidemiologic surveillance of viruses, and for obtaining insight into viral evolution and fitness. Infectious agents, and especially RNA viruses, can rapidly change and adapt to their host and produce many variants (quasispecies) [1, 5\u20138]. In order to identify these variants, thousands of sequences are needed, which makes NGS particularly useful. An RNA virus family that has gained specific interest, through the emergence of SARS and MERS as well as through containing a number of animal pathogens, is Coronaviridae [9]. Coronavirus have high mutation rates and are prone to recombination [10]. Virus quasispecies composition with negative and positive interactions among mutants, is the source of virus evolution during \u201cgroup selection\u201d and influences the biological behaviour of a viral population [5, 11]. Therefore, it is important not only to have techniques that can rapidly sequence new emerging coronaviruses but also those that investigate the quasispecies population in order to understand the biology of these important viruses.",

The specimen was thawed on ice and the swab medium centrifuged at 9700 x g for 10 min. Two technical replicates were processed individually until library preparation and NGS. The supernatant (140 \u03bcl) was treated with 2.8 \u03bcg RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and 6 Units Turbo DNase (Ambion, MA, USA) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Thereafter RNA was extracted with QIAzol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and chloroform phase separation. The RNA containing aqueous phase was mixed with 70% ethanol (1:1) and added to an RNeasy Mini Kit column (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer. The RNA concentration (3\u20135 ng/\u03bcl) and purity were measured by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, DE, USA) and the RNA was kept at -80\u00b0C until further use. Estimation of the BCoV copy number (4,1 x 105 genome copies used) was done with RT-qPCR using primers and probe as described by Decaro and colleagues [13]. A tenfold dilution series of a plasmid containing the BCoV amplicon was used as a quantification standard. Quantification of a bovine rhinitis virus (700 genome copies used) that was incidentally found in the nasal sample, was performed in an identical way after establishing a rhinitis virus RT-qPCR and production of a plasmid containing the rhinitis virus target.",

Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses known (27\u201332 kb positive sense RNA) and are considered emerging pathogens in both humans and animals [9]. In order to understand the biology of coronaviruses, it is important to have tools that can generate full-length genome sequences of emerging coronaviruses as well as provide information on the quasispecies population. Direct WGS of the FMDV has been performed on samples containing \u2265 1 x 107 genome copies per ul RNA [2].

Although both methods produced sequences that covered all or most of the BCoV genome, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads mapping to the reference genome. While less than 1% of the reads from the SISPA data sets mapped to BCoV, around 45% of the Ovation reads did. As most of the total SISPA reads (\u02c3 99%) originated from eukaryotes and bacteria and only 8% were classified as rRNA, filtration of the sample as well as an additional DNase treatment of the RNA could have resulted in more viral reads using the SISPA protocol. However, the much higher ratio of BCoV reads (approx. 45%) from the Ovation data sets compared to 0,07% still indicates a significant advantage of this amplification method compared to the SISPA protocol. The benefit of the Ovation method is not restricted to deep sequencing of BCoV as this protocol also gave roughly 1000 times more BRBV reads than the SISPA protocol.",

For quasispecies analysis, a difference in sequence depth across the genome could pose a problem, as the possibility to compare variation in different regions will be reduced. The Ovation kit includes poly-T primers in addition to random (6N) primers, this could cause the 3\u2019end peak, but does not explain the peak in the SISPA dataset. Fragmentation is a factor that may influence the variation of sequence coverage. However, in a study by Knierim et al. (2011) three different fragmentation methods (nebulization, sonication and enzymatic) gave similar coverage patterns [23]. Rosseel et al. (2013) got similar results, as they did not observe any differences when comparing fragmented to unfragmented samples. According to Malboeuf et al. (2012) depth variability across a genome could be due to secondary RNA structures [22], but this was not confirmed by Rosseel et al. who found biased annealing of the random primer, caused by the tag sequence, to influence SISPA results the most [24]. Extending the random sequence (from 6N to 12 N) and including more than one primer tag, may reduce the bias, for both methods.",
