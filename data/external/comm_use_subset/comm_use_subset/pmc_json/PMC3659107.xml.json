Indeed, bats were shown to be involved in several emergent viral diseases (Coronaviruses, Flaviviruses, Astroviruses, and Adenoviruses etc.), with rabies being one of them [1],[2]. Numerous bat species have been found to be infected by lyssaviruses [3] and bats serve as the reservoirs of 10 of the 11 Lyssavirus species described, suggesting that the lyssaviruses originated in these mammals and progressively diverged from a common ancestor [4],[5]. Two new recently described tentative of the three novel Lyssavirus species further enlarged the genetic diversity of lyssaviruses found in bats [6]\u2013[8]. In Europe, two Lyssavirus species, European bat Lyssavirus Types 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2, respectively), and one tentative species, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, circulate among several bat species [7]. EBLV-1 is widely distributed throughout Europe and two variants have distinct distributions and evolutionary histories: one is EBLV-1a, which has an east\u2013west distribution from Russia to France, with very little genetic variation; and the other is EBLV-1b, which exhibits a south\u2013north distribution and far more genetic diversity [9].",

The number of positive cases increased considerably from 1985, when several European countries began routine passive surveillance. From 1977 to 2012, 1033 bats were found to be infected with lyssaviruses in Europe (http://www.who-rabies-bulletin.org). The substantial number of positive bats diagnosed, the number of European countries affected and, above all, the finding that EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 can cross the species barrier to infect other domestic and wild non-flying mammals and humans raised public health issues related to these and other viruses [12],[13].",

Few data are available on the infection incidence in other European bat species. However, active surveillance indicated that several other bat species has serological evidence of previous infection. The role of these species in EBLV-1 epidemiology, particularly Lyssavirus cross-species-infection dynamics, remains unknown. Given the fact that E. serotinus is a non-migratory bat [15], it is possible that migratory species may have a more important role in the dispersion [16],[17] and distribution of the different EBLV-1 genetic variants. With the aim of understanding more about the role of the different bat species in EBLV-1 dynamics and identifying ecological factors that might favor EBLV-1 transmission and, consequently, serological responses to infection in bat colonies, active surveillance of bat colonies in Spain was implemented in 1992. In this study, we analyzed ecological and epidemiological factors that might be associated with the infection dynamics observed in colonies where we previously detected EBLV-1 infection [17]\u2013[19], and completed with data collected during 2001\u20132010.",

The optimal challenge dose (the dilution giving 80% infected cells for each virus production) is calculated. Further, titers are expressed as the arithmetic means of two independent repetitions. Samples were considered positive when the number of fluorescent foci was reduced by 50% at the 1\u223627 dilution (starting dilution).

The high percentage (65%) of seropositive species found suggests that most Spanish species of bats can be exposed to EBLV-1 (Table 1). Even EBLV-1 neutralizing antibodies were identified in M. daubentonii, a species so far linked only to EBLV-2 infection in more northern parts of Europe [40],[42],[44] (Table 3). Furthermore, evidence of EBLV-1 infection was found in 68% of the bat colonies sampled.

Previous studies demonstrated that bat Lyssavirus dynamics exhibited a strong seasonal pattern [25] and that the breeding period could favor bat infection [26]. This seasonal variability was also detected by our model, which indicated significantly higher EBLV-1 seroprevalence in summer (July), when maternity colonies are present in most of the localities.

This variability might be explained by different susceptibilities to infection or immunological responses of the bat species to EBLV-1 virus. For example, we observed important differences between two species from two families: R. ferrumequinum had the highest percentage of positive clots and organs compared to other species, e.g., M. myotis, while the percentage of seropositive R. ferrumequinum was much lower than that of M. myotis. Our results are less in favor of the hypothesis of the difference in susceptibility because R. ferrumequinum bats were infected (nRT-PCR\u2013positive in this study). These differences might rather suggest different seroconversion rates in these two species. In this sense, Turmelle et al. [45] reported that significant differences in seroconversion probabilities were found among bats depending on whether they had previously been infected, suggesting that long-term repeated infections of bats might confer significant immunological memory and reduced susceptibility to rabies infection. Immune competence in bats can vary with body condition (via nutritional status and stress) and reproductive activity and, as a consequence, can lead to a lower rabies seroprevalence between or within bat species [26],[46],[47].",

Notably, EBLV-1 seroprevalence and the colony size, especially large colonies, had a strong positive association. Previous studies suggested that larger colony size could also raise host density and simultaneously favor contact rates between individuals and, hence, the probability of infection spread [49]\u2013[51]. However, colony size alone could not explain all the variability observed, especially when the colonies were comprised principally of one species, suggesting that other factors might be involved in bat seroprevalence. In this sense, Streicker et al. [52] showed that rabies virus (RABV) seroprevalence in common vampire bats was independent of bat-colony size. The absence of a relationship between RABV seroprevalence and colony size in that study could be explained by Desmodus rotundus generally forming small- or medium-sized monospecific colonies. Our results suggested that EBLV-1 seroprevalence was strongly affected by the colony size and species richness, and indicated that multispecies, large colonies, especially those with three or more different bat species, had a higher probability of EBLV-1 infection (Figure 2). Large colonies and multispecies associations occurred frequently among cave-dwelling bats, principally during the maternity period. This colonial behavior confers thermodynamic and social advantages to reproductive females during pregnancy and lactation [53]. Higher seroprevalence was observed in multispecies colonies compared to monospecific colonies, suggesting that interspecific virus transmission plays an important role in EBLV-1 dynamics. A higher number of species might not only increase the rates of contact between bat groups but could also facilitate virus entry or spread through the higher mobility of individuals among colonies, especially if there are migratory species.",

Indeed, these species migrate seasonally a few hundred kilometers [55],[56], and even between Balearic Islands [19].

However, all synanthropic colonies found during our active surveillance were monospecific. P. pipistrellus, one of the most abundant species in southern Europe, has strong synanthropic behavior. In accordance with our results, this species might be less exposed to lyssavirus than cave-dwelling bats because it colonizes buildings and its colonies are often monospecific, small, highly philopatric. These observations could be indicative of a low public health risk associated with P. pipistrellus.",
