In directly transmitted infectious diseases, heterogeneity of infectiousness has been neglected until some evidence of superspreading, i.e., extreme heterogeneity, where the 20% most infectious individuals may be responsible for more than 80% of cases, has been found for example for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in humans (SARS, Galvani and May, 2005) or for Escherichia coli O157 in cattle (Matthews et al., 2006). Generally speaking, heterogeneity increases the growth rate of outbreaks and the probability of stochastic extinction of the pathogen, and lowers the efficacy of control measures (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005). Such heterogeneity may result from various factors, such as host age (Treanor et al., 2011), sex (Silk et al., 2018), immunity (Pathak et al., 2010), behavior (Drewe, 2010), or genetic background (Borriello et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Here we deal with brucellosis, a major zoonosis that causes economic and public health issues worldwide. Infections with Brucella abortus or Brucella melitensis in ruminants mainly lead to late-term abortions and infertility, with substantial shedding of bacteria in the environment through genital fluids. Until recently, European wild ungulates were seen as dead-end hosts and had been thus considered as negligible hosts in Europe (Godfroid et al., 2013). In particular, previous cases of B. melitensis in European wild mountain ruminants were localized events that spontaneously faded out (Garin-Bastuji et al., 1990; Ferroglio et al., 1998; Hars and Garin-Bastuji, 2013). However, an unprecedented high seroprevalence (38% in 2013) was reported in the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) population of the Bargy area (French Alps) (Hars et al., 2013; Garin-Bastuji et al., 2014; Mick et al., 2014). This unique situation constitutes the very first case of self-sustained infection with B. melitensis in wildlife in Europe. The public health and economic concerns, as well as the conservation issues for this recently restored and protected species, raise many questions in terms of disease management in this population. Determining the drivers of pathogen persistence in this population, in order to further evaluate management strategies, is of the utmost importance. This unique situation has been investigated in-depth, through epidemiological surveys in local populations of ungulates, observation of contacts at the interface with domestic herds and bacterial typing (Mick et al., 2014; Freycon, 2015; Marchand et al., 2017). However, our knowledge of Brucella infection and pathogenesis is scant in this species, and cannot be completely extrapolated from knowledge of B. melitensis in domestic ruminants. Indeed, in studies on the wild reservoir of B. abortus in wildlife in the Greater Yellowstone Area (USA), some pathogenesis characteristics of B. abortus were similar between bison (Bison bison) and cattle, but specificities such as increased bison susceptibility were also demonstrated (Olsen and Johnson, 2011). Such specificities could also exist in wild Caprinae infected with Brucella, but similarities and differences are not currently known.",

Nevertheless, in 2012, an outbreak due to B. melitensis biovar 3 occurred in a dairy herd in the northern French Alps (Bargy Massif, 46\u00b0N, 6.5\u00b0E; elevation: 600\u20132,348 m; area: ca. 7,000 ha) (Garin-Bastuji et al., 2014). This re-emergence led to in-depth epidemiological surveys to find the origin of the outbreak. No potential source was identified in other domestic herds (not one infected domestic ruminant out of more than 12,000 tested), suggesting a possible implication of wildlife in this re-emergence. Indeed, an unprecedented high seroprevalence was reported in the Alpine ibex population living in the Bargy area, a remote mountain area. Brucella genotyping confirmed that the strain infecting the dairy herd and the ibex was the same, and closely related to the one observed in domestic livestock in 1999 during the last outbreak reported in domestic cattle in the area (Mick et al., 2014). It was thus hypothesized that a probable spillover occurred from domestic animals to ibex in the 90's and a spillback from ibex to domestic cattle in 2011 (ANSES, 2015).",

Since the discovery of the outbreak in 2012, the Alpine ibex population of the Bargy Massif has been continuously monitored by Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR). Because there were too few physical recaptures to estimate the population size, data on visual recaptures (capture-mark-resight) were used instead. The population size without newborns was estimated at 567 (95% CI: [487\u2013660]) in 2013, at 310 [275\u2013352] in 2014, and at 277 [220\u2013351] in 2015 (Marchand et al., 2017). Using GPS data on marked individuals, Marchand et al. (2017) demonstrated that females are structured in 5 distinct socio-spatial units (Figure 1), whereas males were prone to move between units especially during the mating period. Noticeable differences in seroprevalence were recorded between these units: 2 units (1 and 2) showed seroprevalences <15%, whereas seroprevalences of the other three spatial units (3, 4, and 5) reached 54, 70, and 35% respectively (Marchand et al., 2017).",

We first intended to analyze the probability of an individual being actively infected in any organ, in organs in the pelvic area, or in urogenital organs (i.e., fetuses were not included in these analyses). However, the number of bacterial cultures varied among individuals, thus the probability of finding at least one positive culture in an ibex depended on the number of cultures assayed. To take into account this unequal number of samples between individuals, we used grouped binary data for each individual, where \u201csuccesses\u201d and \u201cfailures\u201d were the numbers of positive and negative bacteriological results, respectively. The dependent variable was thus the probability of observing a positive bacteriological result on a panel of examined organs, using the number of organs tested per individual as weights. Therefore, we analyzed these data using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution (Zuur et al., 2009), and in order to account for random/cluster effects in our dataset, we used a mixed model with glmer from the lme4 R package, with the spatial unit and the year fitted as random effects (Bates et al., 2015). The binomial generalized linear mixed model expresses the log of the odds of the probability of a bacterial culture being positive as a linear function of the explanatory variables. For each explanatory variable, the odds ratio (OR) was therefore expressed as the exponential of the associated model coefficient (Dohoo et al., 2009).",

According to its capture or culling location, each individual was assigned to one of the five socio-spatial units structuring the population previously identified by Marchand et al. (2017). To control for possible variation in the epidemiological background among these socio-spatial units, we considered them as a random effect (ZONE) and we excluded from analyses one individual for which the capture location was missing. Because of small sample size, we also merged individuals belonging to units 1 and 2, since both have similar low seroprevalences. We tested for the influence of sex (SEX) and age (continuous variable in years, AGE) as fixed effects. We tested the influence of the CFT titer as a fixed effect (TITER) as a proxy for active infection, because high levels of circulating antibodies have been linked to active Brucella infection in the domestic species (Dur\u00e1n-Ferrer et al., 2004). As longitudinal studies in Alpine ibex infected by Brucella are not easily conceivable, we could not test this hypothesis, but we assumed that this was also the case in this species. We excluded one individual with a negative CFT (<20 UI/mL), and six animals on which CFT was not performed. We also tested for the period of sampling as a fixed effect (before/after the mass culling performed in autumn 2013: PERIOD). Indeed sampling biases were likely in 2012\u20132013 (captures focusing on animals with the most obvious clinical signs or gross lesions\u2014Freycon et al., 2017). We also used the year of capture as a random effect (YEAR) to control for possible sampling biases and varying epidemiological situations among years (within periods), that could lead to varying shedding patterns. Finally, we tested whether freezing of samples/tissues would decrease the sensitivity of subsequent bacterial cultures by decreasing the amount of Brucella. To this end, we also considered sample treatment as a fixed effect (fresh or frozen: TREATMENT). We also tested for the effect of first-order interactions between sex, age, and CFT because the course of Brucella infection may differ between males and females (Zuk and McKean, 1996).",

This expected heterogeneity would have direct implications on the shedding potential, as we assume that the higher the bacteria load in organs, the higher the shedding probability in associated regions (genital, inguinal, mammary) or fluids (urogenital secretions, semen, fetal fluids). After examining the variable distribution, we used a GLMM with a negative binomial distribution (glmmadmb function from the glmmADMB R package, Fournier et al., 2012; Skaug et al., 2013), where the response variable was the semi-quantitative assessment of the number of CFU per plate for each tissue sample. Since several samples originated from the same individual, we used individual identity (ID) as a random effect. We included the same fixed additive effects as before and added the organ category to evaluate potential differences in Brucella distribution in the organism (ORGAN). We also tested the first order interactions between sex, age, CFT titer and organ category in order to assess the variation over time of Brucella distribution in each sex.",

For each candidate model, we examined the Akaike weights (W), which are relative model likelihoods normalized over the likelihoods of all possible sub-models. A weight can be interpreted as the probability for a candidate of being the best model given the data and the set of possible sub-models (Wagenmakers and Farrell, 2004). We chose the final model based on the number of parameters, following the principle of parsimony: we chose the model with the fewest parameters from the set of \u201cbest models\u201d and when two models had the same number of parameters, we chose the model with the highest Akaike weight.",

Consequently, a confounding effect was possible between the effects of AGE and TITER, however both variables still appeared in the selected model.",

Moreover, the genetic diversity of reintroduced Alpine ibex populations is typically low, which can affect susceptibility to infection (Biebach and Keller, 2010), and this could explain, at least in part, the high susceptibility of the Alpine ibex population of the Bargy Massif to B. melitensis.

In seropositive naturally-infected bulls, Hill (1983) found positive bacterial cultures of testes in 2/17 (12%) of animals. Shedding in the semen is not believed to be a major mode of transmission in domestic animals (King, 1940; FAO and WHO, 1986) but spread of the infection through artificial insemination has been reported (Bendixen and Blom, 1947; Manthei et al., 1950). In the American bison (Bison bison), low amounts of bacteria in the semen outside the mating period did not support this transmission route, but it cannot be excluded that the amount of bacteria could increase during the mating period (Frey et al., 2013). Here, we observed high loads of Brucella in testicular tissues outside the mating period, so it is highly probable that it will also be the case during the rut, possibly allowing sexual transmission.",

Our results are similar to those found in naturally-infected and actively infected cattle, in which Corner et al. (1987) found 70% of positive supramammary lymph nodes.

Moreover, our models reveal that frozen urogenital samples had a significantly lower probability of being culture-positive than fresh ones. The same trend was present but not significant in other organs. Thus, freezing carcasses before necropsy allows for a practical and efficient analysis process, but at the price of a slightly lower sensitivity of bacterial culture. qPCR could have allowed to improve the detection of the bacteria in urogenital organs, but it would not necessarily give us any further information on bacterial shedding as it could also detect DNA of dead bacteria, i.e., without any consequences on transmission.",

However, one cannot exclude that young ibex individuals may play an unrecognized role in brucellosis dynamics since they might get infected early in life, either through transmission from infected females to viable fetus or through the colostrum or the infected environment after birth, and become shedders once sexually mature. In the future, depending on the management measures implemented to control this outbreak, analyzing young ibex might allow us to confirm that sexually immature animals may experience latent (undetected) infection, showing no or mild serological response until their sexual maturity or first gestation, as demonstrated in cattle with B. abortus (Plommet et al., 1973; Lapraik et al., 1975) or small ruminants with B. melitensis (Renoux, 1962; Grill\u00f3 et al., 1997).",

Because CFT titer is also higher in young individuals, confounding effects could be expected between age and CFT titer; however, both variables were actually selected in the final model. In domestic ruminants, it is well-known that infection with B. melitensis in primiparous females often leads to abortion and subsequent Brucella shedding during the last third of the pregnancy (Carvalho Neta et al., 2010; Godfroid et al., 2013). Besides, high shedding was associated with high CFT titers: around abortion or births, CFT titers peaked and reached high values in ewes that shed brucellae, whereas they were notably low in ewes that did not shed the bacteria (Dur\u00e1n-Ferrer et al., 2004). Sexual maturity in the Alpine ibex is reached at the earliest at the age of 1.5 years in females (Couturier, 1962), with first access to reproduction ranging between 1.5 and 3.5 years depending on individuals and population density (Gauthier et al., 1991). Therefore, the highest probability of bacterial shedding and the highest bacterial load in female ibex could correspond to the first pregnancy event. Most animals were captured between April and June, i.e., during the last third of pregnancy, thus in a period of potential abortion and shedding in female ibex (Gauthier et al., 1991). Our results thus suggest the probability of bacterial shedding should be at the highest in primiparous females in relation to abortion, and should decrease during subsequent pregnancies, as observed in wild bison (Treanor et al., 2011) or in domestic ruminants (Tittarelli et al., 2005). Such a scenario might explain the decreasing probability of positive bacterial culture as age increases. Unfortunately, too few pregnant females were integrated in our sample to properly test a relationship between pregnancy status and Brucella shedding. Additionally, shedding in old females could have been underestimated, because too few captures occurred during the birth period, when shedding occurs in vaginal discharges and birth products. In contrast, evaluation of shedding in young females was probably more accurate, as captures occurred during the abortion period.",

On the other hand, males of all ages tend to visit all subunits during the mating period (Marchand et al., 2017) and thus could play a role of transmission between spatial units through venereal transmission. This kind of pattern was hypothesized for instance for Aujeszky's disease in wild boar, with venereal male-to-female transmission during mating and oro-nasal female-to-female transmission only outside mating (Ruiz-Fons et al., 2007; Gonz\u00e1lez-Barrio et al., 2015). This difference could be even more marked in our case, as the efficacy of female-to-female transmission through indirect transmission following abortion or birth is likely to be high, consequently playing a crucial role in maintaining the infection inside spatial units.",

            "text": "As highlighted throughout the discussion, the biology of infection remains unknown as regards young or seronegative ibex for instance. Besides, we used here a cross-sectional study, as it is not easily conceivable to use experimental infection for the study of brucellosis in Alpine ibex (for instance, it would require building BSL-3 facilities respecting the welfare of a wild caprine, which in addition is a protected species in France). Therefore, further studies are needed to better understand the infection dynamics in the whole population. However, our results provide a new insight in the infection epidemiology, which is critical for future development of control strategies. Indeed, heterogeneity due to age and sex can impact the efficacy of management methods such as culling based on the serological status of individuals or groups, for example by skewing population age structure in favor of highly susceptible juveniles (Bolzoni et al., 2007). In the present case, removing old animals might have contributed to limited efficacy of the mass culling performed in 2013 (focused on animals aged more than 5 years old) since older animals were not necessarily the ones shedding the most bacteria. In the Yellowstone area, test-and-cull strategies were indeed most successful at reducing seroprevalences in bison when targeting young seropositive females (Ebinger et al., 2011). Modeling approaches, including the different kinds of data (on Brucella epidemiology and ibex demography) that have been collected in the field from 2012 onwards, will now be used to infer disease management principles that may be relevant in this and other cases.",
