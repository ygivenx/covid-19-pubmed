In human and mice, APOM mRNA is highly expressed in liver and kidney [2]. The human apoM protein (MIM 606907) of 188 amino acids is mainly associated with HDL and to a minor degree with LDL, very low density lipoprotein, and chylomicrons [2]. Plasma apoM has been positively associated with plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) [3]. APOM knockdown in mice by siRNA revealed its anti-atherosclerotic effect by participating in pre-\u03b2 HDL formation and reverse cholesterol transport [4].",

The primary aim of the current study is to establish the association between APOM and T2D susceptibility in a Southern Chinese cohort in Hong Kong. By assuming the same effect size (OR = 1.934) and disease allele frequency as observed in the studies of Northern Chinese [8], the power of the current case-control study is over 95% with 1234 cases and 606 controls. The secondary aims are to examine for association between APOM and component metabolic traits as well as to further assess the function of the gene.",

Therefore, those \u2018susceptible to\u2019 the disease were not distinguished from those \u2018survived\u2019 the disease'. One possibility to circumvent such issue is to examine for similar duration of diabetes across studies being compared and test for difference in duration of T2D by SNP. Interestingly, while our results did not support an association between APOM and T2D susceptibility, stratification of our cases by disease duration allowed us to detect an association between rs805297(C-1065A) and T2D duration. This result implied the possibility that relative to the rs805297-A carriers, the rs805297-C carriers better survived the diabetic condition over the long term and such possibility can be further tested. Interestingly, Zhao et al., recently reported a positive association between rs805297-A and the risk of stroke in Norhtern Chinese (OR = 1.38, p  = 0.002) after adjusting for other risk factors including history of diabetes [26]. Whether such association is present among the Southern Chinese requires further investigation. Nevertheless, losing rs805297-A carriers with T2D to stroke over time provides a plausible explanation for the observed higher frequency of rs805297-C allele in the T2D duration >10 years subgroup (relative to T2D duration \u226410 years subgroup).",

In this study, rs707922 homozygous minor allele (TT) was associated with elevated TC and LDL-C as well as plasma apoM levels in diabetic cases (average BMI of 25.26). These observations are consistent with previously reported positive association between plasma apoM and plasma TC and LDL-C in overweight-obese individuals [3]. Results presented by Han et al. from the study of a Northern Chinese cohort showed significant association between rs707922 T allele and increased risk of cerebral infraction (OR = 1.78, p = 0.000). In parallel they also confirmed hypercholesterolemia as an independent risk factor for cerebral infraction [25]. These results implied the possibility that rs707922 is also a modifier of serum cholesterol in Northern Chinese. The association between rs707922 TT genotype and elevated serum total-/LDL- cholesterol levels in type 2 diabetes found in the current report deserves to be further substantiated in strict replicate studies.",

            "text": "The mechanism underlying the effects of rs707922 on plasma TC and LDL-C levels in diabetes remains elusive. Richter et al., reported HNF-1 alpha being a potent transcription activator of APOM\n[28]. The decreased serum apoM level in maturity-onset diabetes of the young subjects as compared to the controls could be explained by the HNF-1 alpha mutations in these patients [28]. Given the association between APOM and metabolic traits found in this study, one may speculate that SNP rs707922 (G+1837T), in the capacity of an intronic SNP (reference to the APOM1 transcript), may modify APOM expression through SNP-specific recruitment of transcription factors (i.e., PAX 6 showed an allele-specific interaction with rs707922 T by computer prediction as presented in Supplementary Figure S5) and subsequently affect cellular cholesterol homeostasis in liver and possibly other tissues. More interestingly, we found that rs707922 can also assume the capacity as an exonic SNP (i.e., reference to the APOM5 transcript). While the function of APOM5 requires further elucidation, the high renal and hepatic expression levels of APOM1 and APOM5 indicated the possibility of these transcripts coordinate to regulate cholesterol homeostasis in these tissues. Such possibility is further supported by the results showing the activities of ectopically expressed APOM5 in modifying hepatic cell cholesterol content. With regards to systematic cholesterol homeostasis, we observed that homozygous rs707922-T allele associated with elevated total- and LDL-cholesterol levels. One possible mechanism of such elevation is through reducd hepatic and/or pheripheral clearance of circulating cholesterol. Consistent with this notion, our in vitro data showed that hepatic cells over-expressing APOM5-T transcript had lower cholesterol content relative to cells expressing the APOM5-G counterpart.",
