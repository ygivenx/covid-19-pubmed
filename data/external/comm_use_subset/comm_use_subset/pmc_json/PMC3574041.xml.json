            "text": "Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family which comprises approximately 14 genera and 1700 species throughout the world, and is widely spread in tropical and subtropical regions. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2005 edition) listed Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith as an official drug, which showed that the plant could be used as anticancer herbs [1]. In the past, people used the rhizomes and extracts from the plant as vermifuges [2]. The plant can be used to cure many diseases, such as influenza, acute and chronic pharyngitis, cancer, and migraine [3]. In addition, the herb was used as antiviral agents to cure severe acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening viral respiratory illness believed to be caused by a coronavirus [4]. Furthermore, phoroglucinols and flavonoids are known to display a wide array of pharmacological and biochemical actions, and have been isolated from many species of the Dryopteridaceae family [5]. However, so far the constituents with anticancer activity of the plant remain unclear. Thus it is necessary to identify the potent antitumor compounds from this plant.",

The current study was conducted to validate the medicinal use of Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith. 23 compounds were isolated from the ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts, and their structures were elucidated to be protocate chaldehyde (1), woodwardinsauremethylester (2), pimpinellin (3), trans-2-coumaric acid (4), physcion (5), ursolic acid (6), sitost-4-en-3-one (7), betulin (8), 3\u2032,4\u2032,5-Trihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (9), woodwardinic acid (10), sitosterol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (11), sutchuenoside A (12), \u03b2-sitosterol (13), kaempferol-3,7-O-\u03b1-L-dirhamnoside (14), (-)-epicatchin (15), (+)-catechin hydrate (16), kaempferol (17), asiatic acid (18), 2\u03b2,3\u03b2,23-tihydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic acid (19), crassirhizomoside A (20), kaempferol-3-O-(3-O-acetyl-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside) (21), 2\u03b1,3\u03b1,24-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (22), and kaempferol-3-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-\u03b1-L-rhamopyranoside (23). All compounds were isolated from Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith for the first time. The inhibitory activities of these compounds were investigated on tumor cells MGC-803, PC3, and A375 in vitro by MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the results indicated that some of the compounds showed good antitumor activities. It was found that pimpinellin (PPI) had most potent cytotoxic activities against the three cell lines, with the IC50 values of 14.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, 20.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, and 29.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively. However, no report was found on apoptosis inducing activity of PPI. Subsequent staining and flow cytometry (FCM) analysis indicated that PPI could apoptosis in MGC-803 cells, with the highest apoptosis ratio of 27.44% at 72 h after treatment at 20 \u03bcM.",

Smith (10 kg) were cut into pieces and extracted with 80% EtOH (3 \u00d7 40 L) under reflux, 6 h for the first time, 3 h for the second time, and 1 h for the last time. The combined EtOH extracts were evaporated to dryness to yield a dried EtOH extract (424 g). The extract was suspended in water and then extracted with petroleum ether (10 L \u00d7 3 times), ethyl acetate (10 L \u00d7 3 times), and n-BuOH (10 L \u00d7 3 times), respectively. Different extracts solvent were then concentrated using evaporator under vacuum at 50\u00b0C to afford the petroleum ether extract (46 g), ethyl acetate extract (95 g), and n-BuOH extract (110 g). MTT assay was used to evaluate their antitumor activities. The results suggested that the antitumor agents were mainly contained in ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts. Further experiments were performed on ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts to separate antitumor compounds. The ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts were subjected to column chromatography (CC) to yield 16 fractions. An activity-directed isolation process was used to get compounds, and 23 compounds were obtained from these fractions.",

Smith was investigated on the viability of MGC-803, PC3, A375, and NIH3T3 cells using MTT assay at the concentration of 20 \u03bcM, with ADM (Adriamycin) being used as the positive control and DMSO being used as the negative control. The inhibitory percentage of cells was treated with 20 \u03bcM or 50 \u03bcg/mL of each compound or extract for 72 h (Table 1). The results showed that the ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts had great antitumor activity, and PPI had good activities against the three human cancer cell lines tested than other compounds. The inhibitory ratios of PPI at 72 h after treatment were 67.1% on MGC-803 cells, 57.2% on PC3 cells, 45.8% on A375 cells, and 24.8% on NIH3T3 cells. It could be seen that PPI had good antitumor activities and low cytotoxic effect on normal cell line NIH3T3. Further experiments found that proliferation of these three carcinoma cells were significantly inhibited by PPI in a concentration-dependent manner, as shown in Figure 1. The IC50 values of PPI against MGC-803, PC3, and A375 cells were determined to be 14.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, 20.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, and 29.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively, which were lower than that on NIH3T3 cells (IC50 > 100 \u03bcM).",

In early apoptotic cells, phosphatidylserine (PS) which distributed inside the lipid bilayer in the normal cells was transferred from the inside of the cell membrane to the outside. Annexin V, a Ca2+ dependent phospholipid-binding protein with a high affinity for PS, was used to detect early apoptotic cells. PI (Propidine Iodide) was a red fluorescent dye and stained cells that had lost membrane integrity. So, the different periods of apoptotic cells could be distinguished when Annexin V matched with PI: necrotic cells (the upper left quadrant, Annexin-/PI+), late apoptotic cells (the upper right quadrant, Annexin+/PI+), intact cells (the lower left quadrant, Annexin-/PI-) and early apoptotic cells (the lower right quadrant, Annexin+/PI-) [29,30]. As shown in Figure 3, with HCPT as positive control, PPI could induce apoptosis of MGC-803 cells, with the highest apoptosis ratio of 27.44% at 72 h after treatment at 20 \u03bcM. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4 the apoptosis of MGC-803 which treated with PPI increased gradually in a time-dependent manner.",

All compounds were isolated from Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith for the first time. The inhibitory activities of these compounds were investigated on tumor cells MGC-803, PC3, and A375 in vitro by MTT assay, and the results showed that some of the compounds exhibited moderate antiproliferative activities. PPI showed potent activities on MGC-803, PC3, and A375 cell lines, with the IC50 values of 14.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, 20.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, and 29.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively. The apoptosis inducing activities of PPI on MGC-803 cell lines were investigated through AO/EB staining, Hoechst 33258 staining, TUNEL and FCM assay. The results demonstrated that PPI could induce cell apoptosis of MGC-803 cells. Further studies of the specific mechanisms of the compound on human malignant tumors are currently underway.",
