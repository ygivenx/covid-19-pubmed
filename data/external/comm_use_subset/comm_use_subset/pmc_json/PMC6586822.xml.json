            "text": "Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite outside sub-Saharan Africa, with 2.5 billion people at risk of infection and tens of millions of cases every year1. During the asexual cycle, parasites in the human blood invade, grow, and multiply inside young red blood cells (RBCs), bursting at the schizont stage and releasing merozoites into the blood circulation to invade new reticulocytes. RBC invasion is a complex, multi-step process that involves merozoite attachment, apical reorientation, tight junction formation, and host cell invagination and penetration. In addition, it requires the orchestration of multiple ligand-receptor interactions throughout the different steps of the process2. While many of the parasite-host interactions engaged in invasion have been characterized through well-established culture techniques and advanced genetic technologies for Plasmodium falciparum2,3, research on P. vivax invasion mechanisms continues to lag behind owing to the lack of a reliable long-term in vitro culture system dependent on a continuous source of reticulocytes4,5. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in the process of P. vivax invasion is essential for designing meaningful strategies to prevent P. vivax infections. However, the only well-characterized, essential ligand-receptor interaction that has been identified to date is that between the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) on RBCs and P. vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP)6. P. vivax infections are rare in sub-Saharan African populations, where a silencing mutation in the Duffy blood group is present at near fixation levels7. However, recent reports of P. vivax infections in Duffy-negative individuals8, together with recently described receptor-ligand interactions9\u201311 and potential parasite ligands to unknown receptors12, paint a much more complex scenario with multiple host-parasite interactions yet to be well characterized.",

Although this association has not been identified in African populations (Malians and African-Americans)20,22, the two SNPs are under linkage disequilibrium (LD) in both Caucasians and Africans23. An association between low CR1 expression and protection against severe P. falciparum malaria has been reported in some epidemiological studies19,24\u201326 but not in others21,27, illustrating a complex relationship between CR1 and susceptibility to P. falciparum infection and disease.

To investigate the profile of P. vivax invasion, high-CR1-expressing (H-CR1) reticulocyte-enriched RBCs (reRBCs) (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI]: 31.81 and 38.47) (Table 1, Figure S1) were treated with neuraminidase (removes sialic acid residues), trypsin (cleaves several unknown receptors in addition to CR1) and chymotrypsin (cleaves several unknown receptors in addition to CR1 and DARC). Efficient cleavage of CR1 was confirmed by flow cytometry following antibody labeling with anti-CR1 antibody (Fig. 1a). The capacity of the treated cells for invasion was confirmed with the P. falciparum 3D7 strain (Fig. 1b), which results are in agreement with previous findings31\u201333. P. vivax invasion was reduced by 18.9% (SD 28.74%, N = 5 isolates, signed rank p = 0.13) with neuraminidase treatment, 45.69% (SD 18.26%, N = 5 isolates, signed rank p = 0.043, range 33\u201378%) with trypsin treatment, and 96% (SD 7%, N = 5 isolates, signed rank p = 0.043) with chymotrypsin treatment (Fig. 1c, Table S1). The results demonstrate that P. vivax invasion is sensitive to treatment with chymotrypsin and trypsin. The latest reduced P. vivax invasion efficiency by half in the presence of an intact DARC, suggesting that one or more trypsin-sensitive receptors (e.g., CR1) are involved in the process of P. vivax invasion. On the other hand, although P. vivax invasion was not significantly affected by neuraminidase treatment, a potential interacting role of sialic acid receptors cannot be excluded and deserve further exploration in future assays.",

To test whether CR1 availability on the surface of reticulocytes affects the efficiency of P. vivax invasion, we characterized the CR1 exon 22 genotype and CR1 expression levels on the surface of reRBC samples (Fig. 2, Table 1). We identified seven homozygote (HH) and six heterozygote (HL) reRBC samples for the exon 22 SNP (rs2274567) (Fig. 2a,b, Table S2), and observed variable levels of CR1 expression (MFI range: 19.69\u201354.53) (Fig. 2c, Table 1). We did not identify any cases of the LL genotype. To determine if CR1 levels affect P. vivax invasion we compared the invasion rate between reRBC samples expressing high levels of CR1 (High: n = 3; mean MFI: 41.47 SD 10.55) and the sample expressing the lowest levels (Low: n = 1, MFI = 19.69). The level of CR1 expression on L-CR1 reRBC sample was significantly lower than H-CR1 reRBC samples (p = 0.029), while reticulocyte enrichment levels of the L-CR1 reRBC sample (HCR14: 25%) and the H-CR1 samples (HCR40/HCR43/HCR47: 28%/36%/41%) were not significantly different (p = >0.14). In addition, all reRBC expressed similar levels of CD71 on the surface of reRBCs (HCR14/HCR40/HCR43/HCR47: CD71MFI = 3966/3379/3725/3366) and are Duffy a + b+. Collectively, these results suggest no difference in the expression levels of either Duffy receptor or CD71 between low and high CR1 compared reRBCs samples.",

In our case, incubation of neuraminidase-treated H-CR1 reRBCs (Table 1) with sCR1 reduced P. falciparum 3D7 invasion by 90%, confirming previous results (Fig. 3).

These results indicate that sCR1 directly binds to an unrecognized P. vivax ligand and that this interaction reduces binding between P. vivax parasites and native CR1 on reticulocytes.

To test this hypothesis, we performed immuno-precipitation experiments using sCR1, PfRH4 (88 kDa) and five recombinant PvRBP fragments, PvRBP1a, PvRBP1b, PvRBP2a, PvRBP2b, and PvRBP2c, which migrate at 118, 133, 114, 152 and 94 kDa respectively under reducing conditions (Fig. 4).

We therefore hypothesized that CR1 genotypes associated with reduced CR1 expression on the surface of reticulocytes may confer protection against P. vivax infection, possibly reflecting positive selection on L alleles in areas exposed to or with a history of exposure to vivax malaria. Positive selection on one allele can be detected by an unusually fast increase in allele frequency in one population relative to another35 and extended LD surrounding the allele of interest36. To explore our hypothesis, we investigated the frequency of CR1 alleles associated with the L-CR1 phenotype through a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed articles and publicly available data. We first confirmed a LD R2 \u2265 0.8 for the CR1 exon 22 (rs2274567) and intron 27 (rs11118133) alleles in populations sampled within the 1000 Genomes Project (Table S2)23. Using data mining of publicly available databases we identified a SNP in intron 26 (rs11118131), which was in LD (R2 \u2265 0.8) with exon 22 in non-African populations (Table 2). LD between exon 22 and intron 26 was further confirmed by genotyping samples from Vietnam, Thailand, Greece, Belgium, Peru, and Brazil. We included intron 26 in the analysis of CR1 allele frequencies to target additional genotyping data from populations in which exon 22 and intron 27 data were not available. We then analyzed the worldwide distribution of CR1 alleles for intron 27 (rs11118133), exon 22 (rs2274567), and intron 26 (rs11118131), hereafter referred to as L-CR1 alleles. In total, data mining and in-house genotyping retrieved L-CR1 allele data for 34,625 individuals from 177 locations across 61 countries (Fig. 5a, Table S3).",

Further, this significant increase in L-CR1 frequencies (Figure S2) overlapped with the reported transmission intensities of P. vivax in global populations39. A significant increase in L-CR1 allele frequencies was still observed when we compared the mean frequency for African populations (Fig. 5a,b and Figure S2) (mean L-CR1 = 0.21, range 0.1\u20130.28) with that of populations exposed to P. vivax (alone or with P. falciparum) (L-CR1 \u2265 0.33, p < 0.040).

In brief, several limitations have to be taken into account when performing P. vivax invasion assays: (1) the low parasite densities (0.5%\u20130.01%) in most field/clinical isolates of P. vivax, while >0.1% parasite density is needed to ensure a successful invasion, (2) high proportion of rings (\u226580%) are necessary for a successful invasion, (3) ex vivo adaptation is extremely variable between parasite isolates and this may be partially explained by inherent characteristics of the parasite41, (4) several samples produce a high proportion of gametocyte during the maturation process and are thus discarded, and (5) cryopreserved parasites show lower invasion efficiency than fresh isolates42. The limitations in the number of P. vivax isolates with the correct criteria to perform ex-vivo invasion assays and the number of samples that maturate successfully and present an optimal invasion rate (untreated control well), together with the need to reduce assay variability greatly limit the number of conditions that can be tested with one parasite isolate. Nevertheless, the recent increase in the number of publications using P. vivax ex vivo assays43,44 demonstrates the usefulness of this tool to investigate molecular mechanisms related to parasite invasion.",

In addition, the invasion rates observed are comparable to rates previously reported for different reticulocyte sources5,40,42,45\u201347. Finally, we observed consistently significant invasion inhibition in different experiments using both natural CR1 expression variations of the reRBCs and biochemical approaches to modify CR1 presence at the reRBC surface. In this regard, our findings of a decrease in P. vivax invasion in trypsin-treated cells contradicts previous observations48,49, although a trypsin-sensitive in vitro binding between TfR1-PvRBP2b has been demonstrated to be critical for the recognition of reticulocytes during P. vivax invasion43. Discrepancies with previous studies can be at least partially explained by differences in the experimental conditions. In Barnwell et al.48 the source and enriched proportion of used reticulocytes is unknown, the authors use a single P. vivax Belem strain maintained in squirrel monkey, invasion is monitored after 8\u201310 hours of incubation, while information on invasion rates is lacking.

The authors proposed P. falciparum as the selective force on the CR1 locus. Indeed, many studies have reported an important role for CR1 in malaria infection and pathogenesis52, although investigation of the association between CR1 and P. falciparum susceptibility has depicted a complex scenario with discrepant results17,19,21,27,52. Contradictory results may be explained by multiple factors, including differences in the genetic background of populations and pleiotropic effects of CR1 on different diseases53\u201357, the promiscuous use of the CR1 receptor by P. falciparum parasites during invasion15,16 and rosetting17, the complexity of factors influencing CR1 levels in African populations58, and (as results from this study indicate) selective pressure exerted by P. vivax malaria.",
