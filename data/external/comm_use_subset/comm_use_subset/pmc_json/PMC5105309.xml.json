            "text": "A group of 1000 pigs from a commercial operation in Missouri included 2 % of animals which showed clinical disease of anorexia, weight loss and swollen joints beginning at approximately 1 week post-weaning. Pathological examination of three such animals showed that a variety of known etiologies could account for the signs of two while myocarditis lesions remained unexplained in the third animal who was selected for further studies. Tissues from this 3-week-old pig were submitted to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UMN-VDL) for diagnostic workup in May of 2015. Varied fresh tissues were processed for bacteriology and virology. Tissues were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin, processed by standard technique and stained by hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) technique for light microscopic examination. Sections from these same paraffin blocks were also used for immunohistochemical staining. In the examined pig, Haemophilus parasuis joint infection was confirmed by real time PCR from a joint swab. The light microscopic examination of the tissue slides (trachea, esophagus, synovial capsule, heart, lung, thymus, thyroid gland and lymph node) revealed moderate fibrinous arthritis/synovitis with necrotizing arteriolitis in the synovial capsule. Additionally, light microscopic examination revealed necrotizing arteriolitis in the esophagus, diffuse moderate lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia, and multifocal moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic myocarditis and arteriolitis (Fig. 1a\u2013b) of undetermined etiology. PCV2, influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), pestivirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), porcine parvovirus (PPV) 1 and 2, West Nile virus (WNV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Mycoplasma hyosynoviae, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae infections were ruled out by specific validated PCRs performed at the UMN-VDL following standard operating procedures. Toxoplasma gondii infection was ruled out by immunohistochemistry in sections of heart. Bacterial aerobic cultures from lung, heart and joint were negative.\n",

The homogenate was clarified by 15,000 \u00d7 g centrifugation for ten minutes. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter (Millipore) to remove bacterium-sized particles. The filtrate was treated with a mixture of enzymes to digest unprotected nucleic acids, and viral nucleic acids were then extracted [11]. Random RT-PCR was performed using first reverse transcription and then primer extension using Klenow DNA polymerase and a primer with degenerate 3\u2032 end (GCCGACTAATGCGTAGTCNNNNNNNNN). The double stranded DNA was further amplified by 15 PCR rounds using the same primer minus its degenerate 3\u2032 end [12]. This PCR product was then used as input to generate a library for Illumina MiSeq (2 \u00d7 250 bases) using Nextera\u2122 XT Sample Preparation Kit with dual barcoding. Sequencing of that sample yielded 323,434 reads and after quality control to remove reads shorter than 80 bases and duplicate reads a total of 31,638 reads retained. We compared these sequences with the GenBank non-redundant protein databases using BLASTx. Putative ORFs in the viral genome were predicted by NCBI ORF finder. Sequence analysis was performed using ClustalX [13]. Sequence identity matrix was calculated using BioEdit. To identify the stem-loop structure, nucleotide sequence was analyzed with Mfold [14]. Phylogenetic trees with 100 bootstrap resampling of the alignment data sets were generated using the maximum likelihood method and visualized using the program MEGA version 6 [15]. Bootstrap values (based on 100 replicates) for each node are shown if >70 %.",

            "text": "Using a BLASTx E-score cutoff of 10\u22125, we identified 50 sequences related to circovirus-like SFBeef and PorkNW2/USA/2009 sequences. Matches were also detected to porcine astrovirus 4 (PAstV4) (JF713713.1) (28 reads with 83\u201392 % nucleotide identity), rotavirus A (13 reads with >90 nucleotide identity) and porcine cytomegalovirus (suid betaherpesvirus 2) (6 reads with 99\u2013100 % nucleotide identity). The complete DNA genome of the circovirus was then amplified using inverse PCR with specific primers designed from short-sequence fragments and the amplicons directly Sanger sequenced by primer walking. The PCV3-US/MO2015 genome was 2000 bases in length, with a GC content of 50 %, with two major inversely arranged ORFs encoding replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins (GenBank KX778720) (Fig. 2a). The Rep protein of PCV3-US/MO2015 was 296-aa, sharing aa-identities of 95 % to the Rep of Circoviridae PorkNW2/USA/2009 (Genbank HQ738638) and Circoviridae SFBeef (Genbank KM111537), 55 % to the Rep of bat circovirus (Genbank KJ641723), and 48 % to the Rep of PCV2. Similar to Circoviridae PorkNW2/USA/2009 and Circoviridae SFBeef, the short circo-like genomes previously found in pork and beef from San Francisco supermarkets respectively [7, 16], a non-ATG start codon ORF was identified for the Rep protein of PCV3-US/MO2015. The 2000 bases PCV3 genomes described here differs significantly from the 859 and 1202 bases circular genomes of SFBeef (GenBank NC_025216) and SFporkNW2/USA/2009 (GenBank: HQ738638.1) whose capsid genes are missing [16, 17]. The Rep sequence of PCV3-US/MO2015 contained all three expected rolling circle replication motifs I [FTINN], II [PHLQG] and III [YCKK] [18]. The C-terminal region of the PCV3-US/MO2015 Rep protein also possessed the ATP-dependent helicase Walker A [GKEVGKS], Walker B [ILDDF] and Walker C [ITSN] [18]. The Cap protein (214-aa) of PCV3-US/MO2015 had the highest aa-identity of 44 % to the Cap of Circoviridae PorkNW2/USA/2009, followed by 35 % to the Cap of bat circovirus. The Cap protein of PCV3-US/MO2015 had low aa-identities of 24 and 26 % with those of PCV1 and 2, respectively. The Rep and Cap based phylogenetic analyses showed that PCV3-US/MO2015 clustered together with Circoviridae PorkNW2/USA/2009, Circoviridae SFBeef and bat circovirus (Fig. 2b). The third major ORF encoded a 231 aa protein with 39 % identity over a stretch of a hypothetical protein of Murid herpesvirus 1. That third ORF was 93 % identical to that of the similarly positioned 241 aa protein of SFBeef (YP_009072437). Similar to other members of the genus Circovirus, a stem-loop containing a conserved nanomer [TAGTATTAC] was found [18]. According to the ICTV, members of the genus Circovirus should share >75 % nt-identity over their  entire genome, and >70 % aa-identity in the Cap protein [18]. Pairwise comparison revealed that the identities over these regions in PCV3-US/MO2015 shared less than 50 % identity at the nt- or aa-level to those of any reported circoviruses. PCV3-US/MO2015 is therefore proposed as a new species in the genus Circovirus, and the third circovirus species found in pigs.\n",

The ISH was performed using RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Inc.) described in 2012 [19]. Briefly, unstained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of heart and lung were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of alcohol washes. The sections were then treated with hydrogen peroxide at room temperature for 10 min, boiled in citric buffer for 15 min and incubated with protease at 40 \u00b0C for 30 min. The slides were hybridized with the target probes in hybridization buffer at 40 \u00b0C for 2 h. Then, a sequence of probe amplifiers was added (40 \u00b0C for 15 or 30 min). Hybridization signal was detected as red colorimetric staining using Fast Red, and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. PCV3 mRNA was detected infrequently and multifocally in myocardiocytes, a leiomyocyte of the tunica media of an inflamed arteriole, and inflammatory cells (presumably macrophages) in the myocardium, all of which showed diffuse sarcoplasmic/cytoplasmic reactivity (Fig. 1c\u2013f). PCV3 mRNA was not detected in sections of lung. The same method was used to test for the presence of PAstV4 mRNA in the same heart and lung tissue. No signal of PAstV4 mRNA expression was detected (data not shown).",

The pig was 9- to 10-weeks of age and had a history of respiratory disease and rectal prolapse. The pathologic examination including gross and light microscopic tissue examination, and ancillary diagnostic testing revealed severe segmental necrohemorrhagic and fibrinous transmural proctitis caused by Salmonella Derby infection, moderate multifocal cranio-ventral pneumonia with neutrophilic bronchiolitis and alveolitis caused by Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis and Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection, and mild arthritis caused by Haemophilus parasuis and Mycoplasma hyorhinis joint infection. Additionally, the pig had multifocal mild lymphohistiocytic periarteriolitis of undetermined cause in the heart, kidney and liver (portal tracts). Occasionally in the heart, the inflammatory cells (lymphocytes) infiltrated the tunica media of the arterioles (mural arteriolitis) (Fig. 3a). At the sites of mural inflammation there was pyknotic nuclear debris indicative of apoptosis/individual cell necrosis, and segmental hypertrophy and hyperplasia of overlying endothelial cells. Pyknotic debris was also found in renal and hepatic arterioles characterized by adventitial inflammation but without medial inflammation (Fig. 3b). Lastly, the pig had multifocal mild perivascular lymphocytic encephalitis and meningitis in the cerebellum; the etiology for the cerebellar lesions remained undetermined (Fig. 3c). Tissues were negative for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (bronchial swab), Mycoplasma hyosynoviae (joint), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (joint), influenza A virus (lung), PCV2, EMCV, PPV1 and 2 (tissue pool) by PCR.

            "text": "Attributing causality to a potential new pathogen without fulfilling Koch\u2019s postulates is challenging. Typically, this begins with elimination of usual pathogens known to be able to cause the lesion, and is followed by epidemiologic, clinical, pathological and microbiological investigations that support this new pathogen-disease association. In the pigs examined in our study, the most common viral causes of arteriolitis/vasculitis, namely PCV2 and PRRSV, as well as non-suppurative myocarditis, were ruled out by specific testing leaving the causative agent(s) undetermined. Other potential causes of non-suppurative myocarditis, were ruled out during the initial diagnostic work-up. Concurrently, metagenomic analysis produced results consistent with infection by a new circovirus we called PCV3, whose mRNA was detected infrequently but intralesionally in the tunica media of an inflamed cardiac arteriole, scattered cardiomyocytes and inflammatory cells (presumably macrophages) infiltrating the adjacent myocardium in case 1. These results indicate an anatomical association between transcription of PCV3 viral mRNA and the cardiac lesions of case 1. While all 3 cases identified PCV3 nucleic acids, co-infection with PAstV4 was also detected in these animals. A possible pathogenic role for PAstV4 is therefore also conceivable alone or in concert with PCV3. PAstV4, first sequenced in Hungarian pig feces in 2011 [32], are a diverse group of related viruses that can be detected in the feces of 70 % of European pigs tested with higher viral loads in some age groups of diarrheic pigs [33] and may be associated with diarrhea in pigs from Minnesota [34]. PAstV4 was also detected in the blood of healthy pigs from Croatia [35]. A related astrovirus (75 % nucleotide identity) was recently found in nasal swabs of pigs with an acute respiratory disease in the US [36]. While PAstV4 is a highly prevalent enteric infection in both healthy and diarrheic pigs [34], PAstV4 as a systemic blood infection and in combination with other infectious agents such as PCV3, as was the case for all 3 animals here, is also a credible pathogen for other clinical signs. Multiple bovine astroviruses have also been recently located in brain tissues and associated with neurological signs [37\u201341]. A pathogenic role for the other viruses detected namely rotavirus A and porcine cytomegalovirus in case 1, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in case 2, and equine hepacivirus in case 3 are unknown. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, an uncommon porcine infection, may also be associated with the mild neurological lesions seen in case 2 [42]. Equine hepacivirus may have been introduced by to the addition of equine sera to the heart tissue homogenate.",

The apparently defective nature of these previously described shorter PCV3-like genomes may reflect dependence on a helper virus to provide missing capsid functions. Although the etiology of the myocarditis and arteriolitis in case 1 remain unclear, and nucleic acids of other viruses were also detected in cardiac tissue, the finding of a new circovirus replicating in proximity to the lesions raises the possibility that PCV3 virus may have played a role in the clinical disease.

If shown to be due to PCV3 a 20 nm virus forming crystalline arrays in cardiac endothelial cells in PCV1 and 2 free pigs with myocarditis of undetermined etiology in Australia [43] may indicate a broad geographic distribution for PCV3. Whether PCV3 has long been established in pigs or is emerging from a recent cross-species transmission is unknown and addressing this question will require the study of historical samples. Because the closest known circovirus genome (GenBank: KJ641723) was reported in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) bats may conceivably be the original source of PCV3.
