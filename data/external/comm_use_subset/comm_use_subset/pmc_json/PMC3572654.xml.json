            "text": " Dengue viruses (DENV) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. They consist of four serotypes (from DENV-1 to DENV-4) that are transmitted to humans and other higher primates by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes [1]. DENV cause the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in the world, characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from a flu-like disease (dengue fever) to a life-threatening disease known as dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). The only available way to control dengue is vector control since there is neither a vaccine for human use nor an antiviral drug to inhibit virus replication. Little is known about the site of flavivirus assembly or the details of maturation, but a decrease in endosomal pH is necessary for flavivirus envelope fusion with endosomal membranes leading to release of the viral capsid into the cytosol and initiation of virus replication [2]. Weak bases such as chloroquine (CLQ) accumulate in acidic vesicles and raise the pH therein. By preventing the low pH-induced fusion of viral envelope and cell endosome membranes, CLQ is potentially able to block the entry of certain viruses into the cytosol [3]. The present study examined the effect of CLQ on the DENV-2 replication in Vero (mammalian) and C6/36 (mosquito) cells in order to define whether or not CLQ could be used to reduce viral yield.",

These results suggest that CLQ could have a potential for therapeutic use against dengue virus and even against other viruses that penetrate cells by endocytosis. In that sense, some studies have shown that CLQ inhibits SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in vitro [6, 7]. In addition, di Trani et al. [8] tested the antiviral effects of CLQ in vitro against selected human and avian viruses belonging to different subtypes and displaying different pH requirements. Those authors found that CLQ had inhibitory effect against the viruses when the drug had been added at the time of infection and the effect was lost after 2-hour postinfection. Finally, Eng et al.

In the present study, we observed that in experiments carried out with C6/36 cells infected with DENV-2 and treated with CLQ did not reduce the viral load. In 1981, Coombs et al. [16] observed also that CLQ did not reduce the viral load in experiments carried out with the Sindbis virus in cells of the mosquito Aedes albopictus. Hernandez et al. [17] obtained similar results when they used CLQ to inhibit replication of the Sindbis virus. Two explanations are possible for these findings: (i) CLQ does not block endosome acidification in the cells of the mosquito Aedes albopictus, or (ii) CLQ blocks endosome acidification but not the infection of mosquito cells with the Sindbis virus. These facts suggest that the replication of DENV-2 used in our experiments in Aedes albopictus cells occurs possibly by a pathway of intracytoplasmic penetration other than the endosomal one, which was not blocked by CLQ.",
