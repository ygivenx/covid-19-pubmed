Most reported cases were from countries in the Middle East, among which 82% occurred in Saudi Arabia; other cases were reported from North Africa, Europe, the USA and East Asia, with the latter cases involving individuals who had travelled to the Middle East [3]. Owing to the high mortality rate and the lack of antiviral treatment or a preventative vaccine, MERS-CoV remains a major public health concern.",

The number of comorbidities in relation to mortality is shown in Table 4. Diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), cardiac diseases, renal disease and bronchial asthma were the most frequent comorbid disorders (Table 4). Among the comorbidities, DM, HTN, ischemic heart disease (IHD), congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed significant associations with fatality from MERS-CoV (OR 2.6 (1.4\u20134.9), OR 3.7 (2.02\u20136.9), OR 6.1 (2.1\u201317.2), OR 12.9 (1.3\u2013127.3), OR 5.8 (1.2\u201326.8) and OR 5.2 (4.1\u20136.7), respectively; Table 4). In this regard, the prevalence of death in diabetic and hypertensive patients was similar (28 (50.9%) and 29 (52.7%)), respectively. Further analysis of those patients who had these comorbidities including DM, HTN, IHD, CHF, ESRD and CKD that contributed significantly to mortality from MERS-CoV showed no significant difference in mortality (P > 0.05) between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (data not shown). Moreover, only four cases of asymptomatic patients died representing 1% of total 281 cases, three of these four were elderly aged more than 66-years-old with comorbidities (HTN and/or dementia) and one case aged 55-years-old and had additional multiple comorbidities (DM, HTN, COPD). Taking as presented in Table 4, the presence of two or three comorbidities significantly increased the risk of death from MERS-CoV infection (P < 0.0001).\n",

Mortality was higher in male patients, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.45:1. The predominance of male cases is consistent with the findings reported in previous studies in Saudi Arabia and South Korea [19, 20], which may be associated with cultural or occupational behaviours in males that increase the risk of infection. Saudi citizens showed significantly higher mortality than non-Saudi citizens. The demographic features of the laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-COV infection in the current study showed that only nine patients were aged <20 years; 73.2% were aged 21\u201360 years and 23.5% were aged >61 years. These findings are in agreement with those of previous studies reported in Saudi Arabia [14, 21\u201323]. In addition, the higher mortality rate among elderly patients (>61 years) is consistent with the rate reported in a previous study [24]. A possible explanation for this may be age-associated immunosenescence, which results in a suboptimal immune response in these individuals following exposure to MERS-CoV [25] and the possible interference of underlying comorbidities in elderly patients cannot be ruled out. The clinical presentations of MERS-CoV cases observed in this study have similar symptomatology and frequency to those previously reported [10, 13, 18]. Remarkably, among the noted symptoms, SOB and respiratory failure were significantly associated with higher mortality.",

The observed increase in the mortality rate in MERS-CoV patients with underlying chronic conditions corroborates the findings of earlier studies in Saudi Arabia [13, 18]. This is also in line with the findings for other respiratory diseases such as influenza [26], influenza A H1N1 [27, 28] and SARS [29]. A recent study found that obesity, cardiovascular, hypertension and neuromuscular disease were strongly associated with severe pandemic influenza [26]. In SARS, comorbidities such as immunological, neurological, metabolic and dermatologic diseases were strongly associated with the disease [29]. These conditions are known to weaken the host's innate and humoral immune systems, thereby limiting their ability to counteract any new infection [30].",
