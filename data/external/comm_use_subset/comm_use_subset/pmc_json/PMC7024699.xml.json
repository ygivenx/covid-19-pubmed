Thirty-three diseases and one nuclear accident following an earthquake were reported to the WPRO IHR CP. Forty-three (48%) notifications were about novel influenza viruses, including 32 notifications on pandemic H1N1, four on H5N1, two on H7N9, two on H9N2 and one each for H10N8, H3N2, and H5N6.

In 2008, 70% (19 out of 27) of NFPs were accessible by e-mails. This percentage increased to over 95% since 2011. The other ways of communication, including fax, telephone, teleconference and text messaging were tested in some years with varying results. The number of NFPs who completed the expected tasks increased over the years. In 2015, 21 NFPs made notifications during the allotted exercise time, an increase from five NFPs in 2011. In 2015, 20 NFPs completed the draft EIS posting in the allotted exercise time compared to eight NFPs in 2011.",
