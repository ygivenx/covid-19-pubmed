Many diverse pathogens can be involved in this process, such that bovine respiratory disease is considered to be etiologically complex (i.e., BRDC), and perhaps more challenging to control or mitigate than many diseases caused by a single, discrete pathogen. The most common viral pathogens associated with BRDC include: bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine viral diarrhea viruses 1 and 2, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenoviruses A-D, and bovine coronavirus, whereas the most common bacterial pathogens are Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Manheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma spp.[2].",

Acute effects include production or performance losses associated with the symptoms of BRDC that include fever, rapid breathing, repetitive coughing, nasal and/or eye discharge, diarrhea, dehydration and appetite depression [5, 6]. The prevalence of BRDC is temporally variable, with the proportion of affected feedlot cattle ranging from 5% to 44% over a 15 year period, with an average overall prevalence of 17% in U.S. feedlots [3, 7, 8]. In pre-weaned U.S. dairy calves, the prevalence of BRDC over a 20 year period ranged from 3.3 to 23.6% [4]. The mortality rate for BRDC in pre-weaned dairy calves was 22.5%, even though 93.4% of all heifers diagnosed with BRDC were treated with an antimicrobial agent, and the majority of these calves were also vaccinated for one or more known pathogens [4, 9]. Chronic effects of BRDC have resulted in reduced growth rates and decreased productivity of cows later in life [10, 11]. Cows affected by respiratory disease as a calf were twice as likely to die before calving, and calved at an older age as heifers, than those cows that were not affected by BRDC prior to 90 days of age [12, 13].",

            "text": "Despite the availability and use of vaccines for common respiratory pathogens, the prevalence of BRDC in dairy and beef animals is not declining [7, 14, 15]. Additional approaches to reduce the prevalence or prevent BRDC are needed to positively augment the use of vaccines and current best management practices aimed at reducing stress. Selection of breeding stock that are less susceptible to BRDC represents one viable approach that could be implemented, with the expectation of systematically reducing BRDC prevalence over the long term. Previous studies have identified genetic differences among animals in relation to BRDC susceptibility, thereby providing ample support and precedent for this hypothesis and investigation [16\u201319]. The objective of this study was to identify loci associated with BRDC susceptibility in pre-weaned Holstein calves via a case\u2013control study design. Genome-wide association analyses (GWAA) identified genomic regions associated with BRDC that were largely concordant across four analytical approaches. This level of concordance has not often been reported in other Holstein GWAA studies that have evaluated multiple methods [20], which strongly underscores the potential for genomic selection enabled by BRDC susceptibility loci reported here. Additionally, heritability was estimated for BRDC susceptibility in both the individual and the combined CA and NM Holstein populations to further evaluate the potential for reducing the prevalence of BRDC through the selection of less susceptible breeding stock.",

Likewise, 73 (7.2%) of the control calves (48 males; 25 females) were later reclassified as BRDC cases prior to weaning (i.e., they developed clinical signs), and were subsequently removed from the analysis of the distribution of health scores (Additional file 1: Table S1). However, these animals did remain in the GWAA. Consequently, 2,014 calves (1,011 controls and 1,003 cases) from CA were used in this study. A total of 766 calves identified as females were enrolled from New Mexico (NM). Eighteen of the animals were subsequently identified to be a Jersey or a Jersey crossbred and were removed; leaving 748 Holstein identified heifers in the NM study; 372 as controls and 376 cases. Six percent of the heifers (n = 23) originally classified as matched controls later converted to BRDC case-status but remained in the study, as new diagnostic health scores and swabs were obtained at the time of conversion. Further details regarding the study animals (age, gender, proportion of males and females in the cases and control groups, and diagnostic health scores) may be found in Additional file 1: Table S1.",

The detection of different pathogens in CA and NM may have been influenced by the stage of disease at the time that the diagnostic swabs were obtained at each study site. The difference in the mean health scores between cases and controls (Additional file 1: Table S1) representing the two populations (i.e., CA vs NM; P < 0.001 in both populations) may simply reflect local differences in BRDC disease progression, possibly due to environmental differences or differences in BRDC pathogen(s) at the two study sites (Table 1). Notably, viruses that were important during the initiation of BRDC in Holstein calves may have been missed since the clinical manifestation of disease is necessary to identify cases using the McGuirk scoring system [6]. Moreover, some viruses are only rarely detected in the bovine pharynx beyond the first two days of infection (i.e., prior to their migration to the lung), which may have impacted our diagnostic results. Because this study occurred in an industry setting, the timing and certainty of pathogen exposure was unknown. However, the bacteriology and virology obtained from mid-nasal and deep pharyngeal swabs in this study collectively represent the largest ever dairy cattle diagnostic survey of respiratory pathogens which are likely to influence the clinical manifestation of BRDC. This survey is useful for a variety of reasons, including understanding why GWAA signals might potentially differ between locales, and for understanding the overall diversity in detectable pathogen profiles, as well as their putative frequency distributions among Holstein calves classified as BRDC cases and controls [6]. Therefore, the diagnostic data were helpful in providing a general overview of BRDC pathogen diversity at the time of phenotype classification (i.e., case vs control), but do not necessarily provide precise insight into the temporal and sequential progression of disease with associated pathogens across time. Nevertheless, the use of deep pharyngeal swabs has the very clear advantages of being a much more rapid, less costly, and less invasive sampling technique than transtracheal washes or bronchioalveolar lavage.",

Implementation of EMMAX [21, 22] in conjunction with a genomic relationship matrix (EMMAX-GRM) [23] and an additive model produced moderate pseudo-heritability estimates (h2 = 0.21) for BRDC susceptibility in CA Holstein calves. The pseudo-heritability, as previously defined [21], is the proportion of phenotypic variance that is explained by the empirically estimated relationship matrix. Although it is not an exact analytical replicate of the heritability estimate produced by Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (REML) in the Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) analyses, the EMMAX-GRM pseudo-heritability estimate was very similar to the GBLUP REML heritability estimate (h2 = 0.21) for BRDC susceptibility in the California calves. EMMAX-GRM analyses performed using an additive genetic model also produced a moderate pseudo-heritability estimate (h2 = 0.21) for BRDC susceptibility in the NM calves, which was nearly identical to the GBLUP REML estimate (h2 = 0.20). In a final analysis, we combined the NM and CA calves into a single case\u2013control cohort. EMMAX-GRM pseudo-heritability for BRDC susceptibility within the combined cohort was again moderate (h2 = 0.13), but considerably lower than the estimates produced for the individual populations. This result was supported by the GBLUP REML estimated heritability for the combined population (h2 = 0.13), which was very similar to EMMAX-GRM (Table 2).",

In CM, heritability estimates increase when the animal health phenotype is more precisely defined by the specific microorganism(s) involved in the CM etiology [27]. For example, heritability estimates for susceptibility to CM caused by Coliform species were found to be moderate (i.e., 0.17-0.19) [27], and similar to our estimates for BRDC, whereas heritability estimates were lower when CM cases were pooled (i.e., multiple, unrelated pathogens), or when CM cases were undetected [27\u201329], thereby underscoring the importance of precise animal disease phenotypes.",

However, it should also be noted that the NM calves also tended to be older and presumably more clinically ill (as defined by the McGuirk Scoring System) [6] at sampling than did the CA calves, with the majority of the calves enrolled in the CA study being males, and nearly all of the calves enrolled in the NM study identified as being females by Illumina HD genotype (i.e., X and Y chromosome SNP calls; See Methods).

Among the top 2,000 SNPs from each analytical approach, each SNP (or sliding window of 7 SNPs centered on the third SNP within each window for GBLUP) was given a ranking (i.e., 1 represented the most significant SNP or SNP window) and these rankings were summed across all analytical approaches for each population (Tables 3, 4 and 5). For the CA calves, Figure 1 shows the Manhattan plots for all analyses (EMMAX-GRM, FvR, GBLUP and EIGENSTRAT). In CA, the most significant locus across all four analyses was located on BTA15 between 30\u201331 Mb (Table 3).

Notably, BHV-1 was not diagnostically detected in the mid-nasal or pharyngeal swabs from the CA Holstein calves, but previous experimental challenge and pathology studies have demonstrated that many respiratory viruses, including BHV-1, are only transiently present in the pharynx prior to settling into the lung (Laurel Gershwin, personal communication). Therefore, it is unsurprising that BHV-1 was not detected by our diagnostic procedures, although the host genomic signature of this pathogen was clearly detected and well supported statistically by all GWAA approaches. Our failure to detect BHV-1 likely reflects the temporal and/or transient differences in viral expression and pathology (i.e., since the swabs were taken only at one time point), including latency of the virus in the trigeminal ganglion, or perhaps other factors, both known and unknown [31]. BHV-1 causes a lifelong latent infection and sporadic shedding of the virus which can lead to horizontal transmission to other animals in the herd. In addition to BRDC, IBR also has the potential to cause rhinotracheitis, vaginitis, balanoposhitis, abortion, conjunctivitis, and enteritis [32]. Ulcers of BHV-1 infected animals often occur in the mouth and nose, with mortality as high as 10% [33].",

AZIN1 has been associated with Fanconi\u2019s anemia, tumorogenesis, cirrhosis of the liver, and regulation of polyamine synthesis [35\u201337]. The AZIN1 protein (Az1) regulates ornithine decarboxylase stability, which degrades polyamines, and in turn, up-regulates AZIN1. Interestingly, ornithine carboxylase activity and elevated polyamine levels are detected when cells are transformed by viral agents [38]. Individuals with deleterious mutations involving AZIN1 (i.e., qualitative and/or quantitative) may be more likely to become infected with viruses, such as hepatitis C [38]. Some mutations in AZIN1 may also enhance susceptibility to other viruses, such as those implicated in the clinical manifestation of BRDC. Flanking genes within this region include brain and acute leukemia cytoplasmic (BAALC, HGNC: 14333), and ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 42 kDa, V1 subunit C1 (ATP6V1C1, HGNC: 856). Mutations in BAALC are implicated in myeloid leukemogenesis, and are associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia as well as acute lymphoblastic leukemia [39]. The ATPases are proton pumps that are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes [40]. In drosophila, the overexpression of V1 subunits was recently found to alter the replication capacity of influenza virus [41]. It is also conceivable that alteration of V1 subunits could potentially play a role in the replication capacity of other viruses, such as those involved in BRDC [41].",

SLIT3 is a very large gene spanning 727 kb. The protein encoded by SLIT3 has numerous functions, one of which includes the down regulation of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, Il-6 and IL-8 [58]. SLIT3 has also been implicated in cell migration, axon guidance, inflammation, angiogenesis and organogenesis [59]. The SLIT family of proteins features a tandem of four leucine-rich repeat domains which mediate binding to the immunoglobulin-like domains of the Roundabout (Robo) family of genes [60]. SLIT-Robo signaling has been implicated in immune response through the regulation of dendritic cell migration [61]. Airway dendritic cells are key regulators of pulmonary immune responses, and in the human lung, dendritic cells continuously present antigenic information from the airways to the pulmonary lymph nodes, thereby modulating the regulation of immune responses [62]. Therefore, perturbations of bovine SLIT3 function may also influence susceptibility to BRDC, making it a plausible functional candidate gene for future investigations.",

This decline is most likely due to pathogen and environmental differences at the two study sites. However, the moderate heritability (0.13) estimated for BRDC susceptibility in the combined Holstein population is sufficient to support a nation-wide approach to reduce the prevalence of BRDC via genomic selection. Although each of the methods used to conduct the GWAA have strengths and weaknesses, the concordance between the loci associated with BRDC susceptibility across the four approaches has resulted in the identification of loci that are strong candidates for harboring causal mutations, and these QTL signals are less likely to have arisen solely by type 1 error. Several biologically meaningful positional candidate loci were identified in this study. Among these positional candidates are genes on BTA15 (PVRL1) and BTA23 (DST) that are known to mediate herpes virus entry into host cells, a gene involved in viral susceptibility on BTA14 (AZIN1), and a gene that modulates inflammation on BTA20 (SLIT3).

Studies are currently underway to identify the causal mutations associated with enhanced BRDC susceptibility, as an alternative to relying on array-based SNP markers as imperfect predictors of these mutations. Moreover, unlike approaches that rely on markers in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the causal mutations for genomic selection, the accuracy of utilizing causal mutations to predict susceptibility will not decay over time, and likely will have utility across breeds, which enhances the value and longevity of the final marker panel to the industry. Identification of the causal mutations underlying BRDC QTL will ensure that the initial work of this study is sustainably translated to industry, with QTLs associated with enhanced BRDC susceptibility providing the foundation for identifying causal mutations with the largest effects on susceptibility, so that these may be incorporated into predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) for commercial dairy artificial insemination (AI) sires. As greater than 70% of the dairy calves in the U.S. are conceived by AI annually [63] this will provide immediate translation of our discoveries to a large segment of the U.S. dairy industry.",

Calves housed in hutches between the ages of 27 and 60 days of age were closely monitored and considered for enrollment as either BRDC cases or controls, based on the assignment of calf health scores using a respiratory screening tool developed by McGuirk [6]. Calves were observed before feeding (in the early morning) and assigned a health score as follows: 0 for normal, 1 for slightly abnormal, 2 for abnormal, and 3 for severely abnormal, with a numeric score also assigned for rectal temperature, cough, nasal discharge, eye discharge, and ear tilt as previously described [6]. The ability to induce a cough was assessed by entering the calf hutch and applying pressure to (while massaging) the bovine larynx. A calf with a cumulative score \u2265 5 was enrolled in the study as a BRDC case, and immediately thereafter, a calf adjacent to the BRDC case that possessed a cumulative score \u2264 3 was enrolled as a matched control. If no adjacent calf was suitable, the closest calf in the same row was enrolled as a matched control. Other observed clinical signs (though not included in the scoring system) were status for depression, dyspnea, tachypnea, and watery diarrhea, given the presence of fresh stool. Once enrolled, calves were assigned a case number and the hutch was labeled for subsequent monitoring. After enrollment, calves were observed and scored daily for clinical signs of BRDC. If a previously enrolled control calf converted to a BRDC case, its phenotypic classification was changed from control to a case and two new matched control and case calves were enrolled.",

Samples collected from the nasopharyngeal region utilized a six-inch sterile unguarded polyester swab that was inserted five inches into a clean naris and rotated against the surface for 15 seconds. Thereafter, the swab was removed and cut \u00bc inch above the polyester tip, and placed into 3 ml of viral transport media (minimum essential media, HCO3, HEPES, Gentamycin, Amphotericin B). Pharyngeal recess swabbing utilized a 27-inch sterile guarded swab with a polyester fiber tip (Kalajian Industries, Signal Hill CA 90755). The distance from the nose to the medial canthus of the eye was measured and marked as a gauge on the guarded swab. The swab was inserted through a nostril into the ventral meatus and then advanced toward the pharyngeal recess until reaching the gauge mark at the external naris. The swab was then pushed to open the guarding cap and advanced approximately two inches, rotated against the pharyngeal recess surface for 15 seconds, retracted back into the guarding sheath, and removed from the nose. The swab was cut two inches above the polyester tip, and placed into the same tube of viral transport media containing the nasopharyngeal swab. A second deep pharyngeal swab was placed into 1 ml of bacterial transport media (Brucella broth with 15% glycerol) for the detection of bacteria. All samples were stored on wet ice in the dark until completion of sampling and delivery to the lab. Scissors used to cut individual swabs were disinfected with a dilute Povidone iodine solution, and dried before each use. Bacterial samples were submitted daily for bacterial respiratory pathogen culture to either the California Animal Health and Food Safety lab system (CAHFS, Tulare CA Branch) for the CA samples, or to the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Washington State University (WADDL, Pullman, WA) for the NM samples.

Finally, Sanderson et al.

            "text": "Using the binary BRDC case\u2013control phenotype, the EMMAX-GRM analyses were conducted using an additive model and consisted of single marker tests of association [21], with corresponding estimates for the proportion of variance explained (PVE) by effects at single markers, and utilized a genomic relationship matrix [23], rather than an IBS kinship matrix [21, 22]. EMMAX-GRM analyses treated additive effects at X-linked loci in a different manner to those of autosomal loci, which has previously been suggested [70]. Specifically, within an additive model, hemizygous males may only possess 0 or 1 copy of an X-linked minor allele (excluding the pseudoautosomal region), whereas females may possess 0, 1, or 2 copies of the minor allele. A gender correction reflecting these ploidy differences was utilized to recode X-linked genotypes prior to EMMAX-GRM analyses. All EMMAX-GRM analyses were coded in Python [22, 73, 74] and were executed in the SVS environment (Golden Helix, version 7.7.6), thereby allowing for simultaneous data visualization and exploration while also providing a Python shell that allows for modification of scripts, as needed (i.e., REML versus ML variance component estimates, etc.). Briefly, the general mixed model can be specified as: y = X\u03b2 + Zu + \u03f5, where y is an n \u00d7 1 vector of the observed phenotypes, X is a n \u00d7 q matrix of fixed effects, \u03b2 is a q \u00d7 1 vector representing the levels of the fixed effects, and Z is a n \u00d7 t matrix relating the instances of the random effect to the phenotypes. Herein, we assume that  and , such that , but in this study, Z is simply the identity matrix I, and K is the matrix of pairwise genetic relationships among all samples. To solve the mixed model equations using the generalized least squares solution, the variance components  must first be estimated (21\u201322). We used the REML-based EMMA approach to estimate the variance components as previously described [75], with stratification among all Holstein dairy calves accounted for and controlled using a GRM [23] computed from the filtered Illumina 778 K genotypes. Individual EMMAX-GRM analyses for NM and CA included both sex and age as covariates. Likewise, for our analysis of the combined cohort (NM + CA), both sex and age were again treated as covariates, but we also included a population of origin variable as a third and final covariate (Additional file 2: Figure S1).

Recoding also included the same ploidy-based gender correction for X-linked loci described for the EMMAX-GRM procedure above. We corrected for population stratification using principal components analysis (PCA), with PCA-based correction of the input data using established methods [72, 76]. To identify a reasonable number of principal components for correction of the input data, we first estimated the Genomic Inflation Factor Lambda (\u03bb) [77] across increasing numbers of principal components for each Holstein population, with 9 (NM), 53 (CA) and 91 (CA + NM) principal components yielding Inflation Factors (\u03bb) of 1.06, 1.12, and 1.06, respectively. Thereafter, we implemented the FvR method, which consists of using two regression models commonly referred to as: A) the reduced model and B) the full model; with the significance of the genetic marker estimated after removing the effects of covariates by performing a full versus reduced model analysis. The reduced model included only the dependent variable (BRDC binary case\u2013control status) and any potentially confounding covariates (i.e., the covariates sex, age, or population of origin variable in the combined NM + CA cohort). The full model included all of the variables plus the effect of each genetic marker individually. For the \u201cfull versus reduced\u201d linear regression model (i.e., FvR), the regression sums of squares were calculated both for the reduced and for the full model.

Individual analyses were conducted for the CA and NM populations, with final analyses that included the combined cohort (NM + CA). For comparisons of the top SNPs and loci identified across the four analytical approaches, the top ranked 2,000 SNPs from each of the four analytical approaches were identified and compared. SNPs were ranked either by P value (EIGENSTRAT, EMMAX-GRM and FvR) or by PVE (GBLUP) from 1 (most significant SNP) to 2,000. For comparisons of SNPs that were associated with BRDC susceptibility across all statistical methodologies (EIGENSTRAT, EMMAX-GRM, FvR and GBLUP) as shown in Tables 3, 4 and 5, the ranking of the SNP in each method was summed to arrive at a composite ranking.
