Enveloped viruses use one or more viral encoded glycoproteins to mediate the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. This is a thermodynamically favored process but with one or more very high energy barriers. The energy liberated upon conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins is used to overcome the energy barrier(s) (reviewed in [1,2,3,4,5]). Several viral fusion glycoproteins have been studied in great detail with structures of the initial viral glycoprotein before the fusion process begins (pre-fusion), and a postfusion viral glycoprotein structure after all conformational changes have occurred. While the viral glycoproteins have very different sequences and molecular architectures, the similarity of the postfusion structures suggests that they all mediate fusion by a similar mechanism.",

Each heterodimer consists of a globular, receptor binding domain (blue spheres) and a fusion protein that consists of a fusion peptide, two regions of tertiary structure (N, C), and a region to anchor the heterodimer in the viral membrane. The trimer of dimers usually undergoes a late protease cleavage resulting in a trapped, metastable, fusion-active conformation that requires a trigger to begin the fusion process.(2)After interaction with the appropriate trigger, the fusion-active glycoprotein undergoes an extensive conformation change producing an extended intermediate form that delivers the hydrophobic fusion peptide (blue box) to bury in the target cellular membrane, linking the viral and cellular membranes. Multiple extended viral glycoprotein intermediates are thought to be necessary to form a fusion pore. The globular domains are not shown for clarity.(3)The extended intermediates are energetically favored to collapse.(4)This collapse forms the stable six-helix bundle (6HB) and draws the two membranes together.(5)The apposition of the two membranes causes disruption and mixing of the lipid leaflets, a state called hemifusion.(6)A fusion pore is the result of the final conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins forming a trimer of hairpins. Once triggered, the conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins are thought to occur in a relatively short time resulting in the trimer of hairpins, the thermodynamically favored final structure.",

Class I fusion proteins (e.g., Influenza virus HA and Retroviruses Env glycoproteins) have alpha-helical secondary structures that form (Figure 1: N, C) the extended intermediate, 6HB, and trimer of hairpin structures. Class I fusion proteins have a trimer structure in the native protein, are proteolytically cleaved to form a metastable fusion-active state, and are displayed as spikes, perpendicular to the membrane surface. Class II fusion proteins (e.g., TBEV E) use beta-sheet secondary structures to form the extended fusion intermediate and final postfusion structures. However, the native structure of the fusion protein is a dimer that lies parallel to the membrane. As with Class I proteins, Class II fusion proteins require proteolytic cleavage to form the fusion-active state. Recently, a third class of viral fusion proteins has been identified. Class III viral fusion proteins (e.g., VSV G) have both alpha-helical and beta-sheet secondary structures in their extended fusion intermediates and final postfusion forms. These fusion proteins do not require proteolytic processing to form an active fusion state, nor are the proteins in a metastable form on the virion surface. In addition, while the fusion peptides of Class I and II fusion proteins are buried in the subunit interfaces of the native protein, the fusion peptide region of Class III proteins are exposed. Despite the different structural forms of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the fusion proteins, as well as other differences in presentation on the virion surface, the fusion proteins of all three classes are proposed to follow the fusion mechanism depicted in Figure 1.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, most viral fusion proteins require oligomerization and at least one proteolytic cleavage after synthesis to produce a fusion-active protein complex. The subsequent conformation changes needed for fusion are then locked in a metastable form until an appropriate trigger releases the lock. Up until recently, the triggering viral fusion protein conformational changes was thought to occur by two mechanisms. One mechanism uses low pH exposure in an endosomal compartment to induce the conformational changes leading to the extended intermediate form exposing the fusion peptide to the target membrane (Figure 1: step 1 to 2). Influenza virus is a well-studied example of this mechanism where the HA1 subunit binds to sialic acid causing the trafficking of the virion to the endosomal compartment, but only low pH exposure causes conformational changes in the fusion protein. In another triggering mechanism, the interaction of the viral fusion protein with a specific cellular receptor protein enables the conformational changes to occur at a neutral pH at the cell surface. Most retroviruses are thought to use this mechanism. However, HIV-1, a complex retrovirus, has broken this neutral pH process into two steps, using first CD4 to trigger an initial but partial conformational change in the envelope glycoproteins that enables the binding of a second receptor, CCR5, to complete the triggering process. More recently, a third mechanism has been described for triggering conformational changes in viral fusion proteins: a two-step process that combines receptor triggered conformational changes at neutral pH followed by a required low pH exposure to complete the fusion process. The Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus (ASLV) subgroup A (ASLV(A)) envelope glycoproteins are the most studied example of this two-step mechanism [6,7,8].",

The evolution to use alternative receptors was presumably due to the development of host resistance and/or to expand host range. As with all retroviruses, ASLV viruses initially synthesize their envelope glycoproteins as a precursor polyprotein that forms a trimer. The final maturation step cleaves each polyprotein precursor of the trimer into two glycoproteins: the surface glycoprotein (SU), which contains the major domains that interact with the host receptor, and the transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) that anchors SU to the membrane with a stable, covalent disulfide bond [8,18], and is directly involved in the fusion of the viral and host membranes. This cleavage results in the mature, metastable, fusion-active complex, a trimer of SU:TM heterodimers.",

For viruses that have a CXXC thiol-disulfide exchange motif, for example HTLV-1 and MLV SU glycoproteins, the free Cys of this motif reduces the intersubunit disulfide bond linking the SU and TM glycoproteins: this is an integral step for the fusion process. Other viruses do not have the CXXC motif, for example ASLV Env and Ebola virus GP, and at least some of these viruses appear to retain the intersubunit disulfide bond throughout the fusion process, for example ASLV Env [8,18]. A recent report by Smith and Cunningham studying the multistep fusion and entry mechanism of ASLV(A) identified at least one Cys residue that formed a reactive Cys-thiolate upon receptor-triggered conformational changes that was required for functional fusion and infection [18]. This Cys-thiolate did not mediate isomerization of the SU-TM disulfide bond as expected: the precise function of this thiolate is still unclear. In addition, the authors present evidence that at least two other Cys residues that formed thiolates after receptor triggering on Env. However, these residues could not be studied further since the mutant protein could not fold. In our recently published study (see below) we mapped the disulfide bond pattern of the pre-fusion form of ASLV(A) Env [36]. There are 19 Cys residues in ASLV(A) Env; one residue must be free (Figure 3). The second Cys residue was found to be free. Interestingly, the same Cys residue that forms the thiolate required for fusion and infection. Since all 19 cysteine residues are conserved between subgroup A to E envelope glycoproteins, we are assuming that the disulfides bonds determined using a subgroup A glycoprotein are also conserved for the other subgroups.",

Initial studies identified the carboxyl-terminal half of this 40-amino acid region was required for ASLV(A) receptor function. Three residues in the protein loop formed by the C4\u2013C6 disulfide bond, Asp46, Glu47 and Trp48, as well as several other residues in the carboxy-terminal half of the LDLR domain were identified as critical for the efficient interaction of the quail Tva receptor and the ASLV(A) glycoproteins in a variety of assays [39,40,41,42,43,44]. It was initially thought that since the chicken Tva receptor was identical to quail Tva in this carboxy-terminal half, that chicken Tva interactions with ASLV(A) glycoproteins would be similar. However, a genetic evolution experimental system selected ASLV(A) variants with mutations in the envelope glycoproteins that could now preferentially use the chicken Tva receptor with high binding affinity and infection efficiency but not the quail Tva homolog [22,23,45]. Several critical residues in the amino-terminal half of Tva were found to account for this preference: residues at positions 11, 14, and 31 [46].",

Subgroup E ASLVs, in contrast, required Tvb residues in both CRD1 and CRD2 for efficient virus binding and entry, including intact disulfide bonds and residues Y67, N72, and D73. The TvbS3 protein contains the C62S substitution, which presumably alters the structure of the CRD2 domain, eliminating binding of ASLV(E) but having no effect on ASLV(B) and ASLV(D) binding and virus entry. More recently, the Cys125S substitution in CRD3 of TvbS1 was shown to significantly reduce the binding affinity of the mutant receptor for all three ASLV subgroups, B, D, and E.

Expressing the SU and receptor extracellular domains fused to a region of an IgG, immunoadhesins, resulted in the production of soluble, secreted biologically active proteins with high stability from host chicken cells, the DF-1 fibroblast cell line (Figure 5). The IgG domain also enabled the use of a wide range of standard detection reagents, and well-established IgG purification protocols could be adapted for immunadhesin purification. For our studies we have consistently fused SU to a rabbit IgG (rIgG) and fused the extracellular domain of ASLV receptors to a mouse IgG (mIgG). In this way, a functional assay for SU:receptor interactions was developed that could coimmunoprecipitate the interacting proteins with either an anti-mIgG or an anti-rIgG sera. We have approached the definition of ASLV entry mechanisms by keeping as close to physiological conditions for ASLV replication as possible in vitro: avian cells in which the receptors, viral proteins, and secreted immunoadhesins are synthesized and post-translationally modified as the wild type proteins, and expressed on the cell surface at wild type levels. The ASLV SU and receptor immunoadhesins have provided valuable tools for studying the mechanisms of retroviral entry including the identification of functional interaction determinants of SU and receptor for efficient virus entry [22,23,45,53,57,60]. Finally, the receptor\u2013mIgG immunoadhesins can trigger conformational changes in the mature ASLV Env trimers indistinguishable from a natural, membrane-bound receptor.",

A key observation was cells previously infected by a particular subgroup ASLV, could not then be reinfected by a virus with the same subgroup glycoproteins. The infection block occurred due to the cells expressing the viral glycoproteins which bound and blocked that specific receptor required for entry of viruses requiring the same receptor. The RCAS vectors can be used to chronically infect cultures of avian cells, and the same subgroup vector containing a reporter gene (e.g., AP and GFP) can be used to challenge the cells and quantitate the infectious titer. Two examples of this type of assay are shown in Figure 6A,B [63,64]. The receptor interference assay demonstrates the remarkable receptor specificity for using just one receptor attained by the wild type ASLV envelope glycoproteins with little or no cross-interference. The subgroup J ASLV was used as a control since ASLV(J) encodes very different SU glycoproteins with only 40% identity compared to subgroups A to E. ASLV(J) also uses a very different type of cell surface protein as a receptor, the multimembrane spanning chicken Na+/H+ exchanger type 1 [65], and does not interfere with subgroups A to E infection nor is cross-neutralized with antisera. Mammalian cells do not express receptors for efficient ASLV infection and therefore are resistant to ASLV infection unless engineered to express Tva, Tvb, or Tvc receptors that then allows infection. However, while the ASLV can infect and subsequently integrate its genome into mammalian cells expressing an ASLV receptor, there are multiple blocks in ASLV replication that prevent the production on new infectious virus. As shown in Figure 6C, variants of ASLV can be selected that not only alter the ASLV receptor interference pattern but extend the host range to enable infection mammalian cells.",

ASLV Env glycoproteins, as all retroviral glycoproteins, are initially synthesized as a polyprotein precursor with three precursor proteins oligomerizing to form a trimer. The final maturation step cleaves each polyprotein precursor of the trimer into the SU glycoprotein which contains the major domains that interact with the host receptor, and the TM glycoprotein that anchors SU to the membrane and is directly involved in the fusion of the viral and host membranes. ASLVs have an internal fusion peptide (F) flanked by Cys residues in a disulfide bond that forms a loop. This cleavage results in the mature, metastable, fusion-active complex (Figure 7, step 1 to 2). As with other mature viral fusion proteins, the mature ASLV Env glycoproteins are locked in a metastable conformation. Experimentally, the requirement for receptor triggering followed by low pH exposure to form the 6HB intermediate can be circumvented by treatment of the mature, metastable Env with a strong denaturant like high heat (>55 \u00b0C) (see Figure 7A).",

The triggering of the ASLV viral glycoprotein trimer upon receptor binding results in a conformational change in the SU glycoprotein that presumably separates the SU domains to allow the TM glycoproteins to form an extended structure projecting the internal fusion peptide (FP) toward the host cell membrane. Two domains in TM, HR1, the N-terminal heptad repeat (N, orange domain), and HR2, the C-terminal heptad repeat (C, grey domain), are critical for the formation of the extended structure. The fusion peptide is thought to interact with the target membrane irreversibly, forming an extended prehairpin TM oligomer structure anchored in both the viral and target membranes. The cooperation of several of these extended TM oligomers is thought to be necessary to complete the fusion process.",

At 4 \u00b0C, only partial lipid mixing is possible (restricted hemifusion). The formation of the 6HB can be blocked by addition of the R99 peptide, a C-helix inhibitory peptide that binds to the N-helix blocking complete folding [69]. Upon low pH exposure, the receptor triggered ASLV glycoproteins fold back to form the stable SDS-resistant six helix bundle TM oligomer. TM oligomers in the 6HB form can be assayed using Western immunoblots with an anti-TM serum under defined SDS conditions demonstrating the requirement for physiological temperatures, first receptor triggering and followed by low pH exposure (Figure 7D). Addition of the inhibitory peptide R99 blocks the formation of the 6HB, thus the SDS-resistant TM oligomers are not detected.",

Interestingly, the Tva, Tvb, and Tvc receptors each contain one or more aromatic residues that are critical determinants for proper interaction with ASLV glycoproteins. This suggests that the ASLV glycoproteins may share a common mechanism of receptor interaction with an aromatic residue(s) on the receptor critical for proper triggering of the conformational changes in the glycoprotein trimer required for efficient virus entry.",

The analysis of the biochemical properties of the RCASBP(B) and RCASBP(RAV2) envelope glycoprotein trimers demonstrate fundamental differences between the two glycoproteins in their ability to execute virus entry with the two-step mechanism of ASLV fusion process [64]. The mature RCASBP(B) glycoproteins appear to be more stable compared to the RCASBP(RAV2) glycoproteins upon conformation change triggered by heat with significant levels of triggered RCASBP(RAV2) glycoproteins occurring at low temperatures. In addition, the RCASBP(RAV2) glycoproteins did not appear to require a subsequent exposure to low-pH after receptor induced conformational changes as would be expected and is observed with RCASBP(B) glycoproteins. Changing the four conserved amino acid differences converted the RCASBP(RAV2) glycoprotein properties to RCASBP(B) glycoproteins, and vice versa.

In addition to the expected mutations in HR1 that would compensate, several variants were isolated that had mutations in the N-terminal region of TM outside the HR1 region [69,73]. Finally, some of these mutations in the HR1 region of the TM glycoprotein not only escaped the R99 inhibition, but also expanded receptor tropism to nonavian cells: V388D, A391V, and L402A.

Despite ASLVs only infecting avian species naturally, Jan Svoboda\u2019s group had shown that ASLVs could be used to infect hamsters and rats experimentally with RSVs and used these infected transformed cells to study the RSV life cycle [74,75,76]. Recently, they investigated the mutations acquired by the Prague C RSV env gene that allowed the entry into rodent cells: first by infecting newly born rats with PrC-RSV infected chicken tissue and generating the XC-RSV cell line; followed by XC-RSV rescued from the rat cell line used to infect newly born hamsters and generating the H20-RSV hamster cell line [77]. Eight amino acid substitutions were found in the H20-RSV env gene sequence: three mutations near the N-terminus of the SU glycoprotein, two mutations in the C-terminus of SU, and three mutations in the TM glycoprotein. Unexpectantly, there were no mutations in the SU glycoprotein hr1, hr2, or vr3 hypervariable regions critical for receptor specificity and host range. Upon analysis, the key mutations that allowed the expanded host range were identified as the mutations in the TM glycoprotein, especially the L378S mutation in the fusion peptide. Biochemical characterization determined that the L378S mutation altered the H20-RSV envelope glycoprotein trimers to no longer require a receptor to prime the initial triggering of the SU conformational changes: the H20-RSV glycoprotein trimer could be induced to form TM oligomers most efficiently with low pH exposure alone even at room temperature. The ability to infect mammalian cells was transferred to a subgroup B ALV by constructing a RCASBP(B) vector but with the H20-RSV TM glycoprotein. Thus, they concluded the H20-RSV virus was able to extend its host range to mammalian cells due to the pre-activation of the mutant glycoproteins and not to the use of a new mammalian cell surface protein as a receptor.",

The highly related subgroup A-E ASLVs envelope glycoproteins provide an example of the evolution to use alternate host cell surface proteins as receptors that have been identified and cloned. The unusual two-step entry fusion process of ASLV allows a detailed biochemical dissection of the entry steps not possible with other enveloped viruses. Replication-competent ASLV viruses, and the RCAS series of vectors based on them, have enabled the use of genetic selection strategies to pressure the virus to evolve the envelope glycoproteins to alter receptor binding affinity, receptor usage including mutations that expand their host range. In this way, the virus has naturally identified multiple residues/regions of the envelope glycoprotein important for productive viral glycoprotein receptor interactions as well as provided insights into the subsequent conformation changes in the trimer required for the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.",

These studies highlight the important interplay of SU and TM glycoproteins in the active, metastable trimer necessary to promote efficient ASLV entry. The results identify several themes in mutations that evolved that altered Env glycoprotein receptor binding affinity and/or specificity.\nSmall 1\u20132-amino acid changes in the hr1/vr3 regions can alter receptor binding affinity and receptor usage to even preferentially exploit the subtle differences that exist between one receptor homolog and another, e.g., chicken Tva versus quail Tva; expansion to use chicken TvbS1 and quail TvbQ. In these cases, wild type binding affinity was retained for one receptor homolog while significantly reducing the binding affinity to the other homolog, while maintaining wild type levels of viral replication and titer.Often, the initial evolutionary step is a deletion mutation in the hr1 C5\u2013C6 loop of the SU glycoprotein that knocks out the normal receptor binding affinity and broadens receptor usage to other cell surface proteins including other known ASLV receptors, and may or may not also broaden host range.Subtle differences in the amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of the SU glycoprotein and/or the extracellular region of the TM glycoprotein can affect the specificity and efficiency of the two-step ASLV membrane fusion process. The mutations that alter the biochemical properties of the fusion process often result in an \u201cactivated\u201d envelope glycoprotein trimer that can more easily, and with less specificity, facilitate membrane fusion and virus entry.In general, expansion of ASLV receptor usage away from the extreme one receptor specificity leads to a loss of viral replication fitness and lower maximum titers likely due to the glycoprotein variants causing cytotoxic effects in the cells. While the ability of a virus to use multiple different receptors would seem to be an evolutionary advantage, these studies observe a deleterious effect of an expanded receptor usage that would likely pressure for the glycoprotein to acquire additional mutations to overcome this disadvantage presumably increasing receptor specificity.",

Infectious titers were determined using 10-fold serial dilutions of wild type RCASBP(A), RCASBP(B), and RCASBP(C) viruses, the parental \u0394155\u2013160 virus, and the \u0394155\u2013160 mutant virus supernatants produced using DF-1 cells. The infectious titer was determined by the AP assay. No infectious units detected are denoted with (\u2217). The results shown are an average of three different experiments; error bars show standard deviations. (A) ASLV receptor interference patterns of the ASLVs infecting parental DF-1 cells, and DF-1 cells chronically infected with ASLV(A), ASLV(B), ASLV(C), or subgroup J ASLV, HPRS103. The replicative abilities and receptor usage of RAV-2/Del136\u2013142 mutants. (B,C) The abilities of the ASLV parental viruses and mutants to alter receptor usage in avian cells using a receptor interference assay (B) using virus supernatants produced from transfected DF-1 cells (see above) titered on parental DF-1 cells (DF-1) and DF-1 cells previously infected by ASLV(A), ASLV(B), ASLV(C) or ASLV(J). The same viral supernatants were also assayed for their abilities to infect mammalian cells (C) that do not express ASLV receptors.",
