Current treatment includes general care to support vital organ functions, including fluid replacement therapy, kidney dialysis, blood transfusions and plasma replacement therapy [2]. In the absence of EBOV-specific treatments, efficacious disinfectant and antiseptic products are useful to help prevent the spread of infection [6]. In addition, hygiene measures, such as wearing gloves for any contact with blood and body fluids, medical masks and goggles or face shields have been identified as very important to protect against EBOV transmission.",

Interestingly, for several years the German guideline for virucidal testing [8] has included tests of disinfectants against enveloped viruses including MVA and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), allowing products that are effective against enveloped viruses to be labelled as having a \u2018limited spectrum of virucidal activity\u2019.",

The choice of model viruses is of great importance when establishing such a standard test method. The requirements for model viruses include high resistance to disinfectants and drying, combined with simple virus propagation in cell culture (e.g. growing in high titres). The experts in WG1 suggested the enveloped virus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as the reference virus for the claim \u2018virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash\u2019. This virus has been shown to produce similar results to vaccinia virus strain Elstree in virucidal testing [9], and was chosen because of its low biosafety level that means it does not pose any hazard to employees performing the tests [10], its known environmental stability and its practicability for laboratory use [11, 12]. In contrast, EBOV is a lethal virus and requires the highest biosafety levels for any investigation. Therefore, it is only available for testing in a few laboratories worldwide.",

In a water-soluble complex, the elemental iodine is bound to the carrier polyvinylpyrrolidone. In an aqueous medium, a chemical equilibrium develops to release the active antimicrobial agent iodine, while the complex-linked iodine builds a reservoir for delivery [14]. Thereby, its microbicidal activity is maintained but the cytotoxic effects of high concentrations of iodine are reduced [14]. The oxidative potency of PVP-I enables the iodine released to react rapidly with functional groups of amino acids and nucleotides, as well as with double bonds of fatty acids, resulting in a manifold destruction of various structures and enzymes of microbes and viruses. The development of resistance mechanisms against the very broad oxidative attack appears almost impossible [13, 15].",

Molecular sieving with Microspin S 400 HR columns is not the method of choice for EBOV because the process reduces the titres of these large, filamentous viruses by 1.00 to 2.00 log10. In LVP, a high volume of the lowest apparently non-cytotoxic dilution of the inactivation assay test mixture is added to the detector cell line and the cultures are monitored for virus-specific effects.

In this study, we investigated the antiviral efficacy of PVP-I against MVA and then verified the concentration and contact time findings with EBOV. We found that PVP-I was as effective against EBOV as MVA with similar concentration and contact time parameters. In fact, when comparing the results with the 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser, which was pre-diluted to 1:100 for the EBOV test, MVA was even more resistant to PVP-I under dirty conditions than EBOV.

According to WHO guidelines, hand hygiene is the most important infection prevention and control measure against EBOV [6]. Generally, there are two methods of hand hygiene, social hand washing and hygienic hand disinfection [32, 33]. Socially clean hands are achieved using soap and water, which removes transient microorganisms. Social hand washing should be practised before and after performing routine tasks in all clinical areas. Hygienic hand disinfection is carried out with alcohol-based hand rubs toto remove or destroy all transient microorganisms, and may have a prolonged effect. It is recommended, for example, during outbreaks of infections, and after contact with body fluids or infectious material.",
