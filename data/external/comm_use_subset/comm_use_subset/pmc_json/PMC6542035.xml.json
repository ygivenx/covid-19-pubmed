Increasingly, mechanistic models of disease transmission seek to incorporate this spatial dimension [1\u201313]. The spatial distribution of a population is a key determinant of transmission, typically incorporated into a model by representing underlying patterns of population mobility and their implications for contact [4, 6, 12, 14]. Parameterising this mobility behaviour is an ongoing challenge, as available data are often incomplete and biased [15, 16]. Here, we explore and evaluate the use of mobility data and influenza case reports for modelling and predicting spatial patterns of disease at an urban scale.",

The spatial heterogenity of populations, however, contributes to the dynamics of spread, and the availability of spatially-indexed mobility and disease data is increasing. Models that incorporate space may therefore provide better explanations for observed epidemiology and more accurate predictions of future outbreaks. Similarly, control interventions may be spatial in nature; for example, the imposition of quarantine zones, or culling of livestock around infected farms [17, 18]. Predictive models that incorporate a spatial dimension are thus important to identify geographic subpopulations at particular risk, and hence to more effectively target preventative measures or allocate public health resources [19].",

Determining which types of mobility behaviour are most relevant to disease transmission depends on the geographic scale of interest. Many modelling studies have been concerned with predicting the spread of an infectious disease at a national or international scale. Examples of this include evaluating the effectiveness of various strategies for containing outbreaks of pandemic influenza [2, 20] and Ebola [5]. Of particular interest are the patterns of international movement that can rapidly increase the scale and human cost of disease outbreaks that would once have remained more geographically constrained. Other studies have considered transmission patterns at an urban scale. Again, a key aim is to evaluate the likely effectiveness of spatially defined control measures such as school closures [21]. In the case of dengue, urban-scale spatial models have been used to help explain observed epidemiological patterns, untangling the respective roles of human and vector movement [10, 22]. At a smaller scale still, some studies have focused on disease transmission that may occur within individual buildings such as schools and hospitals [23\u201327].",

Population sizes are much smaller than at national and international scales, thus the stochastic nature of infection events will play a stronger role in the dynamics of a disease outbreak. The number of infections at this scale is also likely to be much smaller, therefore the availability of disease surveillance data to calibrate models is often more limited. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when considering spatially-disaggregated data, for example, by suburb or similar statistical unit. For small case counts, the possibility of surveillance data being affected by reporting biases is also increased. Finally, contact and mobility data at the urban scale can be very difficult to observe and accurately infer from data.",

Statistical data is often collected on \u201cjourneys to work\u201d (JTW), giving some information on urban mobility patterns. Yet, JTW data only capture a fraction of total journeys made, restricting both the types of journeys captured (i.e., commuting), and the time period captured (census day only). Small-scale studies have measured urban mobility using GPS tracking and/or structured interviews [32, 33]. Larger studies have utilised data generated by mobile phone and social media use [34, 35]. Although these efforts have advanced our understanding of human mobility behaviour, a general solution to parameterising spatial urban-scale models of disease transmission remains an open challenge [8].",

In this study, we address a particular gap in our understanding: how does the nature of the mobility data, and the spatial scale at which they capture mobility, influence the veracity of the contact model? We therefore explore the impact of different sources of mobility data, and different models of how this mobility translates into patterns of contact. We evaluate how these patterns of contact and infection relate to reported influenza incidence in the city of Melbourne, Australian, given the limitations of these mobility and disease data sets.

But given the richness of population mobility and contact patterns [33, 44] and the limitations of the mobility data sets available (e.g., in terms of the population sample, the limited capture of transport by transport modalities other than personal vehicles, lack of knowledge regarding lengths of stay), this cannot be claimed.

First, thus far much greater attention has been paid to the role of mobility on infection at either large spatial scales (e.g., national [2, 12, 14, 45, 46] and international [6, 15, 47, 48]) or substantially smaller scales (e.g., individual schools [49] and universities [27]), than the scale of a single city. At large scales, the analyses are less nuanced and hence the bias in the mobility data may be of less importance. Conversely, at very fine scales, rich data at individual levels can be captured. Second, comparatively few studies have combined detailed mobility data with spatially-indexed disease data in order to investigate the spatial risk profile of infection; we are not aware of any studies that have done so at an urban scale. Existing studies have primarily focused on using high-resolution mobility data and individual-based models to estimate or fit the basic reproduction number [10, 21, 50, 51], or have used spatially-indexed disease data to infer \u201ceffective\u201d contact patterns [52] (i.e., combining contact and case ascertainment).",

This characterisation of the CBD is evident in the influenza case data: compared to all of the neighbouring SA3s, the CBD has a markedly lower relative risk of notified influenza cases (Fig. 6). This approach can be extended to other transport and workforce hubs, and can also be generalised to incorporate other forms of domain knowledge about urban mobility that are not explicitly captured in the mobility data. This represents a fundamental shift from treating incoming mobility as exerting a force of infection on the resident population, to treating the resident and transient populations as distinct groups with disparate risks of infection.",

Therefore, if a higher level of spatial aggregation than SA3s were desired, the use SA4s as the unit of aggregation would not be appropriate. A better fitting spatial aggregation would retain the radial division of SA4s, but would push the boundary that separates the inner SA4s (206\u2013208) from the outer SA4s (209\u2013213) outwards. This unsuitability is not surprising, as SA4s are designed to reflect labour markets rather than the spread of infection, and therefore focus on the employed workforce.

At urban and smaller spatial scales, the stochastic nature of the infection events can dominate the outbreak dynamics and the average mobility patterns of the population may not be strongly reflected in the time-series data for any single outbreak [27]. The mobility patterns at an urban scale are also fundamentally different to those at other scales [53]: they include a mixture of routine journeys (e.g., journey to work or school), work related and logistic journeys, and irregular social trips (e.g., ad-hoc social activities, emergencies). The duration of stay at the journey destination(s) can also vary from minutes to days, and this has different consequences for the risk of infection than in national and international travel, where the minimum duration of stay is likely to be on the order of hours or days. Finally and most importantly these journeys are much less readily observable than major highway traffic, airline travel trips, and individual movement in enclosed environments such as schools, shopping malls, and military bases, in particular due to privacy concerns associated with extensive and spatially resolved population tracking [54].",

Fine-scale and detailed data have only small coverage, and are compiled by time- and resource-intensive methods, such as computer assisted telephone interviews [33] and contact diaries [44, 55].

These detailed studies provide a much richer depiction of individual mobility and social encounter behaviour, capturing heterogeneity by age, gender, type of location and geographic area.

We investigated how two different data sets characterise urban mobility in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, and the implications mobility has on the spread of infection across the urban system. We have in particular demonstrated how to account for features such as highly-connected regions (hubs) where the resident population is likely to experience a much lower force of infection than the transient population. We have further shown that population mixing models informed by mobility data sets yield spatial distributions of infection that reproduced some of the spatial features of influenza case notifications, despite the inherent limitation of these mobility data and the influenza cases data. A more robust treatment of urban mobility and contact in the context of infectious diseases requires (a) a richer characterisation of population mobility and contact, which are typically only obtainable through intensive small-scale studies; and (b) deeper knowledge of spatial ascertainment biases in the disease surveillance data. The pervasiveness of mobile phone ownership means that mobile phone data could provide a sufficiently-detailed picture of mobility and contact across most demographics. Until available, the relationship between reported disease cases and the population experience of infection remains a fundamental challenge for infectious diseases epidemiology, which new and emerging data sources may help to address [59\u201361].",
