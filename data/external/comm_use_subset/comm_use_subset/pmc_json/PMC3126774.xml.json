Characterization of field isolates suggested that PRRSV are genetically diverse, and this genetic variation increases the difficulty of developing effective vaccines. Based on significant sequence differencesPRRS viruses are grouped into two distinct genotypes, European isolate (Lelystad virus, LV) and North American isolate (VR-2332) [1]PRRSV has two major structural proteins, GP5 and M, encoded by ORFs 5 and 6, respectively. GP5, the most important neutralizing antigen of PRRSV, has the highest genetic diversity among isolates [2]. And, recent studies in Yorkshire \u00d7 Landrace crossed and outbred pigs, showed that there are two immuno-dominant T-cell epitopes derived from the GP5 protein: L117AALICFVIRLAKNC and K149GRLYRWRSPVII/VEK [3]. The M protein, which contains highly conserved amino acid sequences, also has very good immunogenicity and is associated with protection against PRRSV infection. DNA vaccinations have also revealed that M is the most potent inducer of T lymphocyte proliferation [4].",

Vaccines based on inactivated PRRSV virus have been ineffective at inducing protective immune responses. Live-attenuated PRRSV vaccines can provide protection against this pathogen, but have been observed to revert to virulence [5], restricting the application of this vaccination approach. The rational development of future PRRSV vaccines will necessitate a systematic understanding of the protective humoral and cellular immune responses that occur during PRRSV infection, and should aim to induce a broad immune responses that accommodates the plasticity of the major antigenic sites. Recent research has indicated that cell-mediated immunity may play a very important role in the clearance of PRRSV [6]. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill virus-infected cells and eliminate potential sources of new virus [7]. Hence, identification of CTL epitopes is crucial in the design of synthetic vaccines, and a number of studies have successfully identified pathogen-derived T cell epitopes [8-11].",

In the current study, we report the identification of CTL epitopes from the PRRSV (Ch-1a strain) M protein in a mouse model. We screened peptides derived from the PRRSV M protein for their ability to induce interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 in splenocytes harvested from BALB/c mice following DNA vaccination and a booster vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing M protein. The screen identified two peptides that elicited IFN-\u03b3 production in CD3+CD8+ splenocytes of vaccinated mice. A multiple amino acid sequence alignment among different PRRSV M proteins indicates that these two peptides are strongly conserved across multiple PRRSV strains and therefore should be considered for further research.",

A subsequent booster vaccination with the recombinant vaccinia virus, rWR-PRRSV-M, elicited a further increase in PRRSV-specific antibody (P < 0.01, Additional file 5, Fig. S5). In contrast, control mice vaccinated with pVAX1-only or PBS-only did not show significant increases in M protein-specific antibody titers after the booster vaccination with rWR-PRRSV-M (P > 0.05, Additional file 5, Fig. S5). Overall, mice vaccinated with pVAX1-Ub-M generated significantly higher M protein-specific antibody titers compared to mice vaccinated with pVAX1 or PBS (P < 0.01, Additional file 5, Fig. S5). These results indicate that rWR-PRRSV-M amplifies the protective effects of DNA vaccination and reveals the advantage of this priming-boosting strategy.

Consistent with the ICS data, peptides K93FITSRCRL and F57GYMTFVHF elicited IFN-\u03b3 production from splenocytes of vaccinated mice when measured by ELISPOT, whereas unstimulated splenocytes and splenocytes stimulated with an irrelevant peptide did not reveal IFN-\u03b3 producing cells (Figure 2).
