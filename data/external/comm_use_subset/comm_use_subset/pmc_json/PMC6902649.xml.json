Since 2004, PCR has been instrumental in the early\ndetection of various zoonotic influenza viruses in humans, including A(H5N1), A(H5N6),\nA(H7N9), A(H9N2) and others in the Western Pacific Region. (5) NICs worldwide now routinely perform\nconventional, real-time and/or multiplex PCR for molecular detection of influenza\nviruses. In addition to PCR, some NICs in the Western Pacific Region have introduced\nother molecular tests (e.g. sequencing, pyrosequencing, next-generation sequencing) as\nwell as serological assays (e.g. haemagglutination inhibition, virus neutralization) and\ntesting for sensitivity to antiviral drugs. Nevertheless, serological and\ndrug-sensitivity assays require influenza viruses to be amplified from clinical\nmaterial, meaning that laboratories performing these tests must still maintain good\ncapacity for traditional methods.",
