JEV is responsible for frequent epidemics of encephalitis in humans in most parts of Southeast Asia, China, Korea, Japan, and India. It is a neurotropic virus accounting for \u223c50,000 cases of encephalitis annually of which \u223c30% result in mortality and another \u223c30% in long lasting neuropsychiatric complications [1]. The treatment strategies upon diagnosis of JEV infections are mostly supportive and symptomatic as no specific therapeutic treatment is presently available.

The genomic RNA has a type I cap (m7GpppAmp) at the 5\u2032-end and lacks polyadenylation at its 3\u2032-end. The \u223c11-kb genome has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of 3432 amino acids that is subsequently cleaved to produce three structural proteins, capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 (REF). The ORF is flanked by 95- and 585-nucleotides long non-coding regions (NCRs) at the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends, respectively [2]. The 3\u2032 distal region of \u223c100 nucleotides within the 3\u2032-NCR is predicted to form a stable stem loop (SL). Although the size and the nucleotide sequence of the NCRs differ among different flaviviruses these sequences adopt a secondary structure of similar size, shape and predicted thermodynamic stability [3], [4]. The conservation of RNA structures and their location among flaviviruses in the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-NCRs suggest their possible functional relevance in viral replication [5], [6].",

Our understanding of the role of PTB in virus replication is largely based on studies with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and picornaviruses where it is involved in IRES-mediated translation initiation [23]\u2013[27]. In addition, PTB was shown to bind the 3\u2032-NCR of DENV-4 genome [14], and both 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-NCRs of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) RNA [27], and the protein was important for efficient virus replication [13], [28]. PTB has also been shown to bind the 3\u2032-NCR of JEV antigenome [3NCR(-)] [29] although its role in virus replication was not known. In the present study we demonstrate that PTB, in addition to binding JEV 3NCR(-) RNA, also binds 5\u2032-NCR of JEV positive-strand RNA [5NCR(+)] in vitro. We also show that nuclear PTB relocalized to cytoplasm during JEV infection where it associated with viral RNA leading to inhibition of RNA transcription and virus replication. This constitutes a novel cellular mechanism employed by the host to control JEV infection.",

Compared to sh-Luc-transfected cells, there was a small but consistent increase in JEV titers in PTB-silenced cells (Fig. 5b). Thus, titers were 60% and 150% higher in PTB knocked-down cells infected at a moi of 0.1 and 1.0, respectively. This effect was reproduced in HEK cells (data not shown). These data suggested an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication.",

We and others have observed by EMSA that JEV NS5 binds to the 5\u2032-NCR of the JEV genome and its complementary sequence in the antigenome. Since PTB was found to strongly interact with both these NCRs in vitro, the competitive binding of PTB and NS5 to 5NCR(+) and 3NCR(-) was studied by UV-induced cross-linking assay followed by RNase digestion. A constant amount of NS5 protein and increasing amount of PTB was added in a binding reaction with radiolabelled 5NCR(+) and 3NCR(-) RNA. The UV cross-linked RNA-protein complexes were treated with RNase A and the products were electrophoresed and autoradiographed. As shown in Fig. 8, in the absence of any RNA-binding protein the RNA got completely digested and no band of any complex was seen. In the presence of NS5, a specific RNA-protein complex could be visualized. As the concentration of PTB increased in the binding reaction, the binding of NS5 to 5NCR(+) RNA was not affected. However, binding of NS5 with 3NCR(-) RNA was inhibited with the increasing PTB concentration and it was completely inhibited in presence of high amounts of PTB in the binding reaction. No inhibition of NS5 binding to viral RNAs was observed in presence of BSA. These data indicate that PTB can competitively inhibit NS5 binding to 3NCR(-) RNA which is important for the positive-strand RNA synthesis. These data also confirmed our earlier finding that PTB had higher affinity to 3NCR(-) RNA than to 5NCR(+). This is borne out of the empirical observation that under identical conditions 10 ng PTB showed clear binding to 3NCR(-) whereas 400 ng PTB was needed to show similar binding to 5NCR(+) (Fig. 8).",

Western blotting using antibody specific for Serine-16 phosphorylated PTB [41] showed a 100% increase in phosho-PTB level in the cytoplasmic fraction of JEV-infected cells although total cellular levels of PTB did not change (Fig. 9a). To further analyse the role of PKA in PTB phosphorylation and translocation to the cytoplasm, Vero cells were treated with a cAMP analogue, 8-bromo cAMP which is converted to cAMP inside the cell and acts as immediate upstream activator of PKA [42]. Following treatment with 8-bromo cAMP, cells were infected with JEV and virus titers determined. The viral titers were 50% reduced at 18 h pi and this reduction was further pronounced to 80% at 24 h pi in cAMP analogue-treated cells (Fig. 9b). These data indicate that increase in cAMP levels can inhibit JEV replication probably through PKA mediated phosphorylation of PTB.",

            "text": "PTB is a 531-amino acid, 58-kDa ubiquitous RNA-binding protein. It was originally identified as a protein with a role in splicing but it is now known to function in a large number of diverse cellular processes including alternative spicing [43], mRNA stabilization [44], [45], polyadenylation [46], [47] and non-traditional translation initiation [48], [49]. The protein contains four RNA-recognition-motif type RNA binding domains. It has been reported to stabilize cellular mRNAs by binding to NCRs for insulin [50], vascular endothelial growth factor [51], CD154 [52], inducible nitric oxide synthase [53], and phosphoglycerate kinase 2 [54]. PTB has also been shown to interact with the genome of several single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. For example, PTB interacts with the 5\u2032-NCR of Polio virus genome [55], 5\u2032-leader RNA of Mouse hepatitis virus [56], 3\u2032-NCR of DENV-4 [14] and DENV-2 RNA [15], 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-NCRs of CVB3 RNA [27], and IRES of HCV RNA [57]. PTB was previously shown to bind the JEV 3NCR(-) in vitro\n[29]. Using EMSA and UV-cross linking, here we show that PTB also bound to 5NCR(+) of JEV genome although it had higher affinity for 3NCR(-) RNA. That PTB indeed associated with JEV RNA during viral infection of cell was established by RNA-protein colocalization in infected cells and JEV RNA pull down using PTB antibody. The preferred RNA-binding site of PTB is a U/C tract [58]\u2013[60] and it was shown to interact with a poly U sequence in the 3\u2032-NCR of HCV genomic RNA [61]. A polypyrimidine tract, CUUCUU (nucleotides 20\u201325 of JEV genome) exists in the 5\u2032 stem of the 5\u2032-NCR which may be involved in interaction with PTB. The JEV 3NCR(-) RNA contains the sequence UCUAA that is thought to be the putative PTB binding site [14], [56], [62].",

            "text": "In picornaviruses, such as polio and CVB3, PTB acts as an IRES trans-acting factor activating viral translation initiation [22], [27], [63]. PTB is reported to bind HCV RNA too, although there are conflicting reports on its effects on IRES-mediated translation and virus replication [23], [24], [64]\u2013[66]. To examine the role of PTB in JEV replication the protein levels were down-regulated by siRNA or up-regulated by plasmid-based PTB over-expression in cultured cells where JEV replication was monitored by determining the virus titres or by studying the JEV RNA and protein levels in virus-infected cells. A significant increase in JEV titer in PTB knocked-down cells and a significant suppression of virus titer in PTB over-expressing cells showed that PTB acted as a negative regulator of JEV replication. Our studies show that PTB binds the 3\u2032-end of the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA and competes efficiently with the binding of NS5 to this end of RNA. It may be noted that binding of NS5 to the 3\u2032-end of the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA is required for the synthesis of plus-sense genomic RNA. Indeed, in PTB over-expressing cells we saw significantly reduced levels of plus-sense JEV RNA. This may contribute to suppression of JEV titers in PTB over-expressing cells. Similarly, cells with knocked-down levels of PTB showed increased levels of plus-sense JEV RNA and enhanced viral titers. These results suggest that PTB suppressed JEV replication in cells by inhibiting JEV genomic RNA synthesis. These observations were similar in both Vero and HEK cells and thus negative role of PTB in JEV replication was not cell type specific.",

Our observation is strikingly different from that seen in the case of another flavivirus, DENV-2, where PTB knock-down inhibited production of infectious virus and thus PTB was necessary for efficient virus propagation [13]. Interestingly, PTB had no role in YFV replication, another flavivirus [13]. It would, thus, appear that PTB may play varied role in RNA virus replication. Specificity of PTB function may be achieved by its interaction with additional proteins of cellular and viral origin besides its interaction with different RNA elements in different viruses.",

In the present study, PTB was found to translocate to cytoplasm and colocalize with JEV RNA as early as 6 h pi. The translocation of PTB from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has been documented during infection with several RNA viruses, such as poliovirus, rhinovirus, feline calicivirus, and HCV [25], [62], [67]. In case of TGEV, a coronavirus with positive-strand RNA genome, PTB has been shown to colocalize with the viral RNA in the cytoplasm [68]. In case of DENV-2 infection, PTB was shown to translocate to cytoplasm in Vero cells [15] whereas no such translocation was seen in Huh 7 cells [13], [28]. This difference was postulated to be related to the intrinsic differences between the two cells types including the fact that Vero cells did not express interferon stimulated genes [15]. It is important to note, however, that PTB translocated to the cytoplasm following JEV infection of both Vero and HEK cells, and it had inhibitory role in JEV replication in both these cells.",

Phosphorylation of Ser-16 in the NES is required for accumulation of PTB in the cytoplasm [41]. In our studies, as PTB translocated to the cytoplasm during JEV infection the levels of phosphorylated PTB increased significantly. In addition, enhancement of intracellular levels of cAMP resulted in significantly suppressed JEV titers in Vero cells. In PC-12 cells, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of PTB is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) which directly phosphorylates Ser-16 of PTB [41]. These data together suggest that JEV replication may be controlled by the host cells through PTB phosphorylation which is mediated by the cAMP-PKA activation pathway. These are preliminary findings and additional experiments need to be carried out to investigate PTB phosphorylation and its role in JEV replication.",
