Viral particles of all viruses from the Filoviridae family (order\nMononegavirales) have a characteristic filament-like shape, and their genome is\nrepresented by a single-stranded RNA with negative polarity. There are three\nfilovirus genera: Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus,\nand Cuevavirus. Of these, Ebolaviruses and\nMarburgviruses have marked pathogenicity to humans, and the\nEbola virus (EBOV) is the most dangerous pathogen. To date, five Ebola virus\nspecies have been identified: Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV),\nZaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Reston ebolavirus\n(RESTV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), and Tai\nForest ebolavirus (TAFV); of these, ZEBOV, SUDV, and BDBV are the most\ndangerous for humans\n[4, 5].\n",

Various\nstudies have demonstrated that it is cellular immunity that plays a key role in\nthe formation of protective immunity to the Ebola virus\n[19, 20].\nDirected depletion of CD3+ (CD8+ and CD4+) cells in monkeys immunized against EVD caused\na decrease in vaccinated protective immunity, which resulted in the death of\nall the animals from Ebola virus infection. If only CD8+ cells were depleted,\nthe protective response also decreased in immunized monkeys: 80% of the animals\ndied. At the same time, passive transfer of high-titer polyclonal antibodies to\nthe Ebola virus from vaccinated monkeys to naive ones provided incomplete\nprotection against lethal infection: 75% of the animals died despite the high\ntiters of common IgGs and NtAbs in peripheral blood serum\n[20]. The importance of cellular immunity\nwas indirectly confirmed by the fact that the peripheral blood of people who\nsurvived EVD contained an increased number of specific CD8+ cells compared to\nthe blood of healthy people. At the same time, the number of specific CD4+\ncells did not actually increase [21].\n",
