            "text": "Avian reovirus (ARV), a member of the Reoviridae family, is a pathogenic agent in chicken (Gallus gallus) and is associated with several diseases such as viral arthritis and malabsorption syndrome, causing considerable economic losses in the poultry industry [1]. The primary method to control ARV infection in chickens is vaccination, but the vaccines do not protect animals from all antigenic subtypes [2]. The ARV genome contains ten segments of double-stranded RNA that encode at least eight structural proteins (\u03bbA, \u03bbB, \u03bbC, \u03bcA, \u03bcB, \u03c3A, \u03c3B, and \u03c3C) and four non-structural proteins (\u03bcNS, P10, P17, and \u03c3NS) [3]. The roles of some of these viral proteins in ARV replication and pathogenesis have been characterized. For instance, outer capsid protein \u03bcB is involved in viral entry [4]. Outer capsid protein \u03c3C is a cell attachment protein [5], and overexpression of \u03c3C in cultured cells can induce apoptosis [6]. Other studies have shown that the non-structural protein p10 is a multifunctional protein that not only causes syncytium formation in transfected cells [7], but also enhances membrane permeability [8]. More recent studies have reported a connection between ARV proteins and cellular signaling pathways. For example, non-structural protein p17 triggers autophagy, enhancing viral replication through the PKR/eIF2alpha signaling pathway [9], and capsid protein \u03c3C induces apoptosis via the DNA damage signaling pathway [10].",

The strips were incubated in equilibration buffer containing 6 M urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 1% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and 65 mM dithiothreitol for 15 min, followed by incubation in the same buffer containing 240 mM iodoacetamide for an additional 15 min. The equilibrated IPG strips were transferred onto 26\u00d720\u2212cm 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and run in an Ettan DALTtwelve system (GE Healthcare) at 4 W per gel at 10\u00b0C until the bromophenol blue dye front had migrated to the bottom of the gels. Each 2D gel was run in triplicate. The 2D gels were scanned at the appropriate wavelengths for Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5 using an Ettan DIGE Imager (GE Healthcare), and the scans analyzed using DeCyder 2-D Differential Analysis Software v7.0 (GE Healthcare) to detect, normalize, and quantify the protein features in the images. Spots displaying a \u22651.5-fold increase or decrease in intensity of the AVR-infected samples relative to the mock-infected samples (with p<0.05) were selected for protein identification.",

These results are similar to what has been observed in HIV-infected T cells [40], although the metabolism-related proteins involved are not identical. Upregulation of energy-associated proteins may promote ARV replication and other energy-dependent biological processes [41]. Conversely, several proteins involved in the glycolysis pathway were downregulated in ARV-infected DF-1 cells, similar to observations in HIV-, IBDV- [12], and chikungunya virus-infected host cells [42].",

It will be interesting to examine whether ARV-induced autophagy regulates host cell lipid metabolism. p53 regulates autophagy and glucose metabolism via the TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), and the crucial functions of TIGAR are to block glycolysis, restrict production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and limit apoptosis [44].

An earlier study found a gradual increase in ROS during ARV S1133 infection of DF1 cells [10].

GAPDH also contributes to various other non-glycolytic processes, including nuclear membrane fusion [45], microtubule binding [46], RNA transport, and apoptosis [47]. GAPDH may also play a direct role in the viral life cycle. GAPDH has been shown to physically interact with RNA from Japanese encephalitis [48], hepatitis A [49] and parainfluenza viruses [50].

This result suggests that ARV turns off the host cell translation apparatus and initiates viral translation, consistent with the recent report that ARV non-structural protein p17 inactivation of host cell protein translation involves eIF2\u03b1 and eEF2 [25]. Moreover, upregulation of RPSA has also been observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus- and IBDV-infected cells, suggesting that it may play a role in the viral multiplication process in host cells.

ARV infection has previously been shown to cause apoptosis and enhance p53 expression [55]. In addition, PSME3 inhibits apoptosis and promotes MDM2-mediated p53 degradation [56]. The downregulation of PSME3 that we observed suggests that ARV infection likely reduces MDM2-dependent degradation of p53 in DF-1 cells and promotes apoptosis. Decreases in PSME3 have also been observed in IBDV-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts [12] and H1N1 influenza virus\u2212infected porcine alveolar macrophages [57].

Previous study indicated that transient transfection of liver cells with PRDX6 siRNA resulted in a rise in peroxide-induced cytotoxicity by apoptosis, implying that suppression of PRDX6 promotes apoptosis [60]. Therefore, the downregulation of PRDX6 here we observed suggests that ARV infection decreases the anti-apoptotic function for PRDX6.

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification, which covalent conjugated with ubiquitin-like proteins named SUMO-1, -2, and -3 to target proteins (12672486). Previous study has indicated that MDM2 can promote SUMO-2 and -3 modification of P53 to both activate and repress some P53-target genes (PMC3218624). To our knowledge, decreased expression levels of ANXA5 and SUMO3 proteins have not been reported in virus-infected cells.

ARV \u03c3C is known to induce apoptosis in cultured cells [17] through p53 and the mitochondria-mediated pathway [62]. Upregulation of \u03c3C in this study suggests that it also promotes apoptosis in DF-1 cells. HSPD1 is a mitochondrial chaperonin that promotes pro-caspase-3 maturation and regulates apoptosis [63]. HSPD1 is also upregulated in cells infected with H1N1 influenza virus [57]. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic protein VDAC2 is a mitochondrial porin [64] that regulates cell permeability and appears to cause swelling of the mitochondrial matrix in Nipah virus\u2212infected cells [65]. A viral protein from another chicken dsRNA virus, IBDV, has also been shown to induce apoptosis in DF-1 cells through interaction with VDAC2 [66], but a specific interaction between ARV proteins and VDAC2 has yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic protein YWHAB, which was downregulated by ARV in our study, is thought to play a crucial role in the anti-viral innate immune response [67]. These ARV-induced changes in apoptosis regulating proteins are similar to those observed in HIV-infected T cells [40].",
