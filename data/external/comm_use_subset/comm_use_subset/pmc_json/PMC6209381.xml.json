A successful host shift relies on a number of stages occurring [8]. Firstly, exposure of the host to the new pathogen species must occur in such a way that transmission is successful. Secondly, the pathogen must be able to replicate sufficiently to infect the novel host. Finally, there must be sufficient onwards transmission for the pathogen to become established in the new host species [7,9,10]. Some of the most deadly outbreaks of infectious diseases in humans including Ebola virus, HIV and SARS coronavirus have been linked to a host switch event [11\u201314] and many others have direct animal vectors or reservoirs (e.g. Dengue and Chikungunya viruses) [15,16]. The potential for novel host shifts may increase with changing temperatures due to, fluctuations in host and/or parasite fitness, or changes in species distributions and abundances [17,18]. Distribution changes may lead to new species assemblages, causing novel contacts between parasites and potential hosts [19\u201321].",

Thermally stressed hosts may face a trade-off between the resource investment needed to launch an immune response versus that needed for thermoregulation, or behavioural adaptations to withstand sub-optimal temperatures [26\u201329]. Temperature shifts could also cause asymmetrical or divergent effects on host and parasite traits [30]. For example, changes in temperature may allow differential production and survival of parasite transmission stages, and changes in replication rates, generation times, infectivity and virulence [31\u201333]. Temperature is also known to impact vector-borne disease transmission through multiple effects on both vector life cycles and transmission behaviours [20,34\u201337].",

Thermal tolerances \u2212 like virus susceptibility \u2212 are known to vary across species, with groups of closely related species having similar thermal limits, with a large proportion of the variation in these traits being explained by the phylogeny [42\u201345]. Previous studies on host shifts have assayed the susceptibility of species at a single temperature [9,39,41,46]. However, if the host phylogeny also explains much of the variation in thermal tolerance, then phylogenetic patterns in virus susceptibility could be due to differences between species\u2019 natural thermal optima and the chosen assay temperatures. Therefore, for experiments carried out at a single temperature, phylogenetic signal in thermal tolerance may translate into phylogenetic signal in thermal stress. Any apparent phylogenetic signal in susceptibility could potentially be due to the effects of thermal stress, and may not hold true if each species was to be assayed at its optimal temperature. If this was indeed the case this would have implications for species distribution models that aim to use estimates of environmental conditions to predict host and pathogen ranges [5,47,48].",

We infected 45 species of Drosophilidae with Drosophila C Virus (DCV; Dicistroviridae) at three different temperatures and measured how viral load changes with temperature. Viral load is used here as a measure of DCV\u2019s ability to persist and replicate in a host, which has previously been shown to be tightly correlated to host mortality [41]. We are therefore examining one of the steps (\u201cability to infect a novel host\u201d) needed for a host shift to successfully occur [7,9,10]. We also examine how proxies for thermal optima and cellular function (thermal tolerances and basal metabolic rate) relate to virus susceptibility across temperatures, as increasing temperatures may have broad effects on both host and parasite [43\u201345]. DCV is a positive sense RNA virus in the family Discistroviridae that was originally isolated from Drosophila melanogaster and in the wild has been found in D. melanogaster and D. simulans [49\u201351]. DCV infected flies show reduced metabolic rate and activity levels, develop an intestinal obstruction, reduced hemolymph pH and decreased survival [52\u201355]. This work examines how temperature can influence the probability of host shifts, and looks at some of the potential underlying causes.",

Each day, two vials of 0\u20131 day old male flies were randomly assigned to one of three potential temperature regimes; low, medium or high (17\u00b0C, 22\u00b0C and 27 \u00b0C respectively) at 70% relative humidity. Flies were tipped onto fresh vials of food after 3 days, and after 5 days of acclimatisation at the experimental temperature were infected with DCV. Flies were anesthetized on CO2 and inoculated using a 0.0125 mm diameter stainless steel needle that was bent to a right angle ~0.25mm from the end (Fine Science Tools, CA, USA)[9,41,57]. The bent tip of the needle was dipped into the DCV solution (TCID50 = 6.32\u00d7109) and pricked into the pleural suture on the thorax of the flies. We selected this route of infection as oral inoculation has been shown to lead to stochastic infection outcomes in D. melanogaster [55]. However, once the virus passes through the gut barrier, both oral and pin-pricked infections follow a similar course, with both resulting in the same tissues becoming infected with DCV [55]. One vial of inoculated flies was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to provide a time point zero sample as a reference to control for relative viral dose. The second vial of flies were placed onto a new vial of fresh cornmeal food and returned to their experimental temperature. After 2 days (+/- 1 hour) flies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. This time point was chosen based on pilot data as infected flies showed little mortality at 2 days post infection, and viral load plateaus from day 2 at 22\u00b0C. Temperatures were rotated across incubators in each block to control for incubator effects. All frozen flies were homogenised in a bead homogeniser for 30 seconds (Bead Ruptor 24; Omni international, Georgia, USA) in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at -80\u00b0C for later RNA extractions.",

Each qRT-PCR plate contained four standard samples. A linear model was used to correct the cycle threshold (Ct) values for differences between qRT-PCR plates. Any samples where the two technical replicates had cycle threshold (Ct) values more than 2 cycles apart after the plate correction were repeated. To estimate the change in viral load, we first calculated \u0394Ct as the difference between the cycle thresholds of the DCV qRT-PCR and the RpL32 endogenous control. For each species the viral load of day 2 flies relative to day 0 flies was calculated as 2-\u0394\u0394Ct; where \u0394\u0394Ct = \u0394Ctday0\n\u2013\u0394Ctday2.

For CTmax the tank was filled with water and for CTmin a mixture of water and ethylene glycol (50:50 by volume) was used to prevent freezing and maintain a constant cooling gradient. Five biological replicates were carried out for each species for both CTmax and CTmin. Temperature was controlled using a heated/cooled circulator (TXF200, Grant Instruments, Cambridgeshire, UK) submerged in the tank and set to change temperatures at a rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/min, always starting from 22\u00b0C (the rearing temperature for stock populations).

All measures were carried out during the day inside a temperature controlled incubator, with constant light, that was set to each of the experimental temperatures that the flies had been acclimatised to. The set up followed that of Okada et al. (2011)[60]. Compressed air of a known concentration of oxygen and nitrogen (21% O2:79% N2) was scrubbed of any CO2 and water (with Ascarite II & Magnesium Perchlorate respectively) and pumped through a Sable Systems RM8 eight-channel multiplexer (Las Vegas, NV, USA) at 100 ml/min-1 (\u00b11%) into the metabolic chambers housing the groups of 10 flies. The first chamber was left empty as a reference cell, to acquire a baseline reading for all subsequent chambers at the start and end of each set of runs, therefore seven groups of flies were assayed in each run. Air was flushed into each chamber for 2 minutes, before reading the previous chamber. Readings were taken every second for 10 minutes by feeding the exiting air through a LiCor LI-7000 infrared gas analyser (Lincoln, NE, USA). Carbon dioxide production was measured using a Sable Systems UI2 analog\u2013digital interface for acquisition, connected to a computer running Sable Systems Expedata software (v1.8.2) [61]. The metabolic rate was calculated from the entire 10-minute recording period by taking the CO2 reading of the ex-current gas from the chamber containing the flies and subtracting the CO2 measure of the incurrent gas entering the chamber. These values were also corrected for drift away from the baseline reading of the empty chamber. Volume of CO2 was calculated as VCO2 = FR (Fe CO2 \u2013Fi CO2) / (1-Fi CO2). Where FR is the flow rate into the system (100ml/min-1), Fe CO2 is the concentration of CO2 exiting and Fi CO2 is the concentration CO2 entering the respirometer. Species were randomly assigned across the respiration chambers and the order in which flies were assayed (chamber order) was corrected for statistically (see below).",

Briefly, any publicly available sequences were downloaded from Genbank, and any not available we attempted to Sanger sequence [9]. In total we had RpL32 sequences for all 45 species, 28s from 41 species, Adh from 43 species, Amyrel from 29 species, COI from 38 species, COII from 43 species and SOD from 25 species (see www.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6653192 full details). The sequences of each gene were aligned in Geneious (version 9.1.8, [63]) using the global alignment setting, with free end gaps and a cost matrix of 70% similarity. The phylogeny was constructed using the BEAST program (version 1.8.4,[64]). Genes were partitioned into three groups each with their own molecular clock models. The three partitions were: mitochondrial (COI, COII); ribosomal (28S); and nuclear (Adh, SOD, Amyrel, RpL32). A random starting tree was used, with a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock. Each of the partitions used a HKY substitution model with a gamma distribution of rate variation with 4 categories and estimated base frequencies. Additionally, the mitochondrial and nuclear data sets were partitioned into codon positions 1+2 and 3, with unlinked substitution rates and base frequencies across codon positions. The tree-shape prior was set to a birth-death process. The BEAST analysis was run twice to ensure convergence for 1000 million MCMC generations sampled every 10000 steps. The MCMC process was examined using the program Tracer (version 1.6, [65]) to ensure convergence and adequate sampling, and the constructed tree was then visualised using FigTree (version 1.4.3, [66]).",

The random effects and the residuals are assumed to be multivariate normal with a zero mean and a covariance structure Vp \u2297 A for the phylogenetic affects and Ve \u2297 I for the residuals (\u2297 here is the Kronecker product). A is the phylogenetic relatedness matrix, I is an identity matrix and the V are 3\u00d73 (co)variance matrices describing the (co)variances between viral titre at different temperatures. The phylogenetic covariance matrix, Vp, describes the inter-specific variances in each trait and the inter-specific covariances between them. The residual covariance matrix, Ve, describes the within-species variance that can be both due to real within-species effects and measurement or experimental errors. The off-diagonal elements of Ve (the covariances) can not be estimated because no vial has been subject to multiple temperatures and so were set to zero. We excluded D. pseudoobscura from the full model as data for BMR was not collected, but included it in models that did not include any fixed effects, which gave equivalent results.",

We observed significant levels of measurement error in the metabolic rate data; this was partially caused by respiratory chamber order during the assay. We corrected for this in two different ways. First, we fitted a linear model to the data to control for the effect of respiratory chamber number and then used this corrected data in all further models. We also used a measurement error model that controls for both respiratory chamber number effects and random error. Both of these models gave similar results although the measurement error model showed broad CIs suggesting the BMR data should be interpreted with caution.

However, this seems unlikely as at 2 days post infection at the medium temperature (22\u00b0C), viral load peaks and then plateaus [41]. Therefore, in those species where viral load increases at higher temperatures the peak viral load itself must be increasing, rather than us effectively sampling the same growth curve but at a later time point. Likewise, in those species where viral load decreased at higher temperatures, viral load would need to first increase and then decrease, which we do not observe in a time course at 22\u00b0C [41]. To check whether this also holds at higher temperatures we carried out a time course of infection in a subset of six of the 45 original experimental species at 27\u00b0C, where we would expect the fastest transition between the rapid viral growth and the plateau phase of infection to occur (Fig B in S1 Text).

Instead, we find the species means diverge with increasing temperatures and so the between species differences increase [73,82]. It is also important to note that temperature may not simply be causing a change in effect size when considering the biological processes occurring during host-parasite interactions [22,83]. For example, virus replication may plateau at higher temperatures due to resource limitation. The observed level of susceptibility may be the combined outcome of both host and parasite traits, which may interact nonlinearly with temperature. We also note that by using a limited range of temperatures for practical reasons we may have not captured all unimodal relationships between viral load and temperature.",

Previous studies that found phylogenetic signal in host susceptibility were carried out at a single experimental temperature [9,41]. Therefore, the patterns observed could potentially be explained by some host clades being assayed at sub-optimal thermal conditions. We used CTmax and CTmin as proxies for thermal optima which, due to its multifaceted nature, is problematic to measure directly [84\u201386]. We also measured basal metabolic rate across three temperatures to see if the changes in viral load could be explained by general increases in enzymatic processes. We found that these measures were not significant predictors of the change in viral load with temperature. This may be driven by the fact that all temperature related traits are likely to be more complex than what any single measure can explore. Traits such as host susceptibility are a function of both the host and parasite thermal optima, as well as the shape of any temperature-trait relationship [37,78].",

However, the mechanisms underlying the changes in susceptibility with temperature seen in this study are uncertain and a matter for speculation. Our results show that in the most susceptible species, viral load increases with temperature; this may be due to the virus being able to successfully infect and then freely proliferate, utilizing the host cells whist avoiding host immune defences. In less susceptible species viral load does not increase with temperature, and in some cases it actually appears to decreases. Here, temperature may be driving an increase in biological processes such as enhanced host immunity, or simply increasing the rate of degradation or clearance of virus particles that have failed to establish an infection of host cells.",

Using a controlled method of viral inoculation allows us to standardize inoculation dose so we can ask, given equal exposure, how does temperature affect the ability of a pathogen to persist and replicate in a given host? However, in nature hosts will be faced with variable levels of pathogen exposure, infected through various modes of transmission and often by multiple strains or genotypes [87]. Such variables may have consequences for the establishment and subsequent infection success of any potential host shift event. It is known that oral infection by DCV is stochastic and immune barriers such as the gut are important [55,88,89], therefore establishing the relevance of infection in the wild in this system would require further study using different potential routes of infection. The geographical distribution of a host will also influence factors such as diet and resource availability [28,90\u201393], and so further work on the role of nutrient and resource availability would therefore be needed to further explore the impact of these on potential host shifts.",

Our results show the rank order of species\u2019 susceptibilities remain the same across temperatures, suggesting that studies of host shifts at a single temperature can be informative in predicting which species are the most vulnerable to a novel pathogen. Changing global temperatures may influence pathogen host shifts; for example changes in distributions of both host and pathogen species may generate novel transmission opportunities. Our findings suggest that increases in global temperature could increase the likelihood of host shifts into the most susceptible species, and reduce it in others. Climate change may therefore lead to changing distributions of both host and pathogens, with pathogens potentially expanding or contracting their host range. Understanding how environmental factors might affect broader taxonomic groups of hosts and pathogens requires further study if we are to better understand host shifts in relation to climate change in nature.",
