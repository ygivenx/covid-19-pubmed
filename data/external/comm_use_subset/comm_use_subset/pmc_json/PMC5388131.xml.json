However, the guideline itself acknowledges that the available evidence for the risk of TB transmission during air travel and outcome data from passenger contact investigations are limited and it calls for a coordinated international approach to research, data collection, analysis and dissemination to strengthen the evidence base for operational decision-making and policy development. Moreover, a systematic review on contact investigations associated with air travel in 2010 argued that the evidence for TB transmission in commercial aircraft is limited and that there is reason doubt the value of actively screening air passengers for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8]. A more recent systematic review on the subject did not find any further evidence of TB transmission and concluded that the risk of TB transmission aboard aircraft seems to be very low [9].",

However, 8,000 smear-positive TB cases are still reported every year [13] and more than 65% of those involve persons aged 65 years or older, reflecting the ageing population. Therefore, incidents in which infectious, particularly elderly, TB cases travel by air unaware of their infectiousness, are not uncommon. On the other hand, almost all children and young adults are estimated to be uninfected [14-16], therefore the positivity among children and young adults could be used as a surrogate marker for the risk of contracting TB in contact investigations. The local governments of Japan usually comply with the WHO guidelines and conduct contact investigations for contacts of smear-positive index TB patients associated with air travel. However, in Japan, no literature has been published on the contact investigations associated with air travel and the outcomes of contact investigations have not been reported.",

When a contact is a resident of another health office's jurisdiction, the initiator health office requests the health office at the residency (implementer health office) to conduct health screening for the contact on its behalf. When a ministry of health of a foreign country requests the national TB programme (NTP) of Japan to conduct a contact investigation associated with air travel for a Japanese resident, the NTP asks the health office of the contact's residence to conduct health screening.

We found that 3.8% of the contacts had positive IGRA test results, with the positivity among the child and young adult contacts being 1.0%, which is almost equivalent to the IGRA positivity in Japanese medical students with no previous risk of TB infection (0.85%) [15] and in healthy university students (0.90%) [16]. This suggests that the risk of contracting TB infection associated with air travel is minuscule.",

We have collected the IGRA test results of more than 600 passenger contacts, enabling us to stratify them into age groups and analyse the data of the age group of 0\u201334 years-olds, who are least likely to have been infected with TB before the relevant air travel.",

As the ECDC guideline further recommends, the infectiousness of the index case, such as transmission to household members or other close contacts, should be considered before initiating air travel-associated contact investigations [9]. As modelling studies suggest, the risk of contracting TB infection on an aircraft varies from low to moderate and is highest in the rows closest to the index case [33]. Limiting the contact investigation to fewer passengers (within two seats surrounding the index case, rather than two rows) in the case of wide aircraft with many seats per row seems reasonable [9]. Countries with a high burden of TB should prioritise other, more important, activities [8].",
