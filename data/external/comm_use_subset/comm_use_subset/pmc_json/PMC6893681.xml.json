It is worth noting that in addition to its occurrence in humans, gout is one of the common diseases that plague poultry and causes huge economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide [3]. Avian gout is commonly divided into visceral gout and joint gout, and the typical clinical pathology of visceral gout is hyperuricemia. According to reports, various aviaries from all over the world have visceral gout, which has become one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of fatality in poultry [4,5]. In the poultry industry, visceral gout can be caused by many factors, including vitamin A deficiency, high dietary calcium, renal insufficiency, chicken astrovirus (CAstV), and NIBV [4,6,7]. Currently, NIBV that causes visceral gout in chicken has become a research hotspot [6,8].",

            "text": "NIBV has become the most common IBV strain in the commercial poultry industry. It is a gamma Coronavirus in the Coronavirus family that exhibit strong renal tropism and has become one of the most familiar pathogens that induce visceral gout outbreaks [9,10,11]. Initially, some IBV strains have been called nephropathogenic IBV because the starting respiratory infection was followed by a heavy kidney infection. A large number of previous research findings indicate that clinical symptoms of nephropathogenic IBV strains infection include increased water consumption, depression, watery droppings, and significant mortality. Notably, necropsy of chicks that died during nephropathogenic IBV infection showed enlarged and pale kidneys and monosodium urate crystal deposition in the renal tubules and ureters [12]. According to histopathology, NIBV replicates on the epithelial surface of the kidney and causes particle degeneration, vacuolation, and desquamation of the tubular epithelium, as well as massive infiltration of heterophilic granulocytes in the stroma [13]. However, there is a substantial lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of NIBV infection. In addition, it is well known that the gut microbial community is closely associated with the progression of diseases, and Inoue et al. also confirmed that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with gut dysbiosis [14]. In our study, we focus on the cecum as organs of particular interest as they harbor the highest microbial cell densities (up to 1011 cells g\u22121) and are significant sites for recycling of urea, water regulation, and carbohydrate fermentations [15,16]. Therefore, we suspect that the gut microbiota may be associated with the progression of visceral gout induced by NIBV infection.",

Applications of omics platforms include the identification of genes (genomics), messenger RNA (mRNA, transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), and metabolites (metabolomics). Moreover, the research of the gut microbiota (microbiomics) has brought increasing concern due to its important affection for different diseases [19]. Many scholars have used multi-omics analysis to make great progress in deciphering the pathogenesis of diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease [20], familial type 1 diabetes [21], autoimmune diseases [22], and cardiovascular diseases [23]. However, to date, there has been very few omics analyses for the study of poultry diseases, and in particular, as far as we know, there is no omics analysis for the study of the pathogenesis of NIBV infection.",

The characterization of these identified genes, metabolites, and microbiota clearly reflected the dynamic changes in the biological processes in chickens with NIBV infection.

Birds in each experimental room were randomly divided into three subgroups (30 birds for each subgroup), with ad libitum access to food and water. Each chicken of Dis groups was intranasally injected with 0.2 mL 105 median embryo lethal doses of strain SX9 at 28 days of age [24], while the Con group intranasally received 0.2 mL of sterile physiological saline. At 38 days of age, four chicken randomly chosen per subgroups were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation, then dislocated their cervical vertebra. The samples in a group were pooled and dead birds were not used for analysis. Ten serum samples were randomly collected from surviving chickens in the Con and Dis groups before euthanasia that were used for uric acid test. Six biological replicates of kidney samples were extracted from each group making a total of 12 samples that were used for GC\u2013TOF/MS analysis. Four biological replicates of kidney samples were collected from each group giving a total of eight samples that were used for RNA-seq analysis.

Among these pathways we found upregulated, \u201cToll-like receptor signalling pathway\u201d, \u201cNOD-like receptor signalling pathway\u201d and \u201cRIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway\u201d are pattern recognition signal receptor pathways involved in innate immunity. Simultaneously, the transcriptome showed that the \u201cperoxisome\u201d and amino acid metabolite pathways were suppressed in chickens infected with NIBV. Based on the above results, we predicted a schematic diagram of important pathways for chickens in the NIBV infection processes (Figure 3e).",

In the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway (Figure 3f, Signal 1), a series of upregulated genes were noticed, including TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, IRF5, TRAF3, and IRF7. It was already reported that TLR7 primarily recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequences of RNA viruses that enter endosomes by endocytosis [38,39,40]. NIBV used in this experiment is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. Thus, the expansion of TLR7 is pivotal for the recognition of NIBV and variable functions of the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway. Moreover, a number of viral glycoproteins have been shown to act as viral PAMPs (Pathogen-associated molecular pattern) that bind to and activate TLR4, leading to IFN-\u03b2 and/or proinflammatory cytokine expression (such as SARS coronavirus) [41]. Ru Liu-Bryan\u2019s study has established that host expression of TLR2, TLR4, and their intracellular adapter protein MyD88 is a major mediator of MSU crystal-induced inflammation [42]. This explains the reason for the increase in Tlr4 transcription levels in this experiment. In addition, the transcriptomic analysis showed that NIBV infection also activated the RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway (Figure 3f, signal 2), which included the transcriptional upregulation of genes such as MDA5, IPS-1, TRAF3, and I\u03baB. This induction may be due to MDA5 acting as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor to trigger an innate immune response against viral infection [43,44,45], while coronaviruses can produce dsRNA intermediates during replication [46]. RLRs can not only be expressed in cells infected with various viruses but also directly recognize and perceive virus products and virus particles present in the cytosol outside of the endosomes [47]. Therefore, we suspect that the RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway has a greater role than Toll-like receptor signalling in recognizing NIBV infection. The activation of the Toll-like receptor signalling and RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathways results in the production of chemokines and other cytokines that induce a proinflammatory response and tissue destruction. In our study, several features that are familiar to chickens infected with NIBV are consistent with the immunopathological disease. These features include the pathological damage of kidney and the presence of increased transcription of chemokines and other cytokines, such as IL-8 (interleukin 8), IL-18 (interleukin 18), and TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor \u03b2).",

            "text": "Peroxisomes act to eliminate a microbial infection by modulating the canonical innate immunity pathways through ROS signalling [48]. Several enzymes with antioxidant activity in the peroxisome are involved in neutralizing ROS to protect the cells from ROS damage. Among these enzymes, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), glutathione S-transferase kappa 1 (GSTK1), dehydrogenase/reductase member 4 (DHRS4), and epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2) are included [49,50]. Multiple viruses have been shown to use different mechanisms to reduce peroxisome numbers or interfere with their functions. In our study, the \u201cperoxisome\u201d was the most important pathway according to the downregulated gene enrichment analysis, which includes CAT, SOD1, DHRS4, and EPHX2 that belong to the peroxisome antioxidant defence system, while the catalase activity was decreased both in kidney and serum (Figure S3). Thus, decreased abundance and/or impaired function of the peroxisome could potentially cause endogenous elevation of ROS. ROS may either straightly trigger NLRP3 inflammasome assemblage or be indirectly sensed through cytoplasmic proteins that modulate inflammasome activity (Figure 3f, signal 3). The NLRP3 inflammasome senses pathogens or danger signals to promote the maturation of cytokines such as IL-18 [51]. The release of active IL-18 engages IL-18 receptor-harbouring cells and promotes inflammatory responses [52]. In addition, uric acid has been reported as another well-established activator of NLRP3 that is usually generated via xanthine oxidase (XOD), accompanying the generation of O2\u2022\u2212 [53,54]. Consistently, in this study, we detected a significant increase in XOD activity in serum (Figure S3) and a significant increase in serum uric acid levels (Figure 1b). These results indicate that NIBV infection can activate the inflammatory response by inducing severe ROS accumulation.",

            "text": "The kidney is responsible for the elimination of 70% of the daily UA production [55]. ATP-binding cassette transporter, sub-family G, member 2 (ABCG2) is a high-capacity urate exporter that is located in the brush border membrane of kidney proximal tubule cells (S3 segment). ABCG2 dysfunction results in extra-renal urate under-excretion and is a common mechanism of hyperuricemia [56,57,58]. In the present study, the ABCG2 mRNA was downregulated in the model group chicken kidneys, partially explaining the significantly increased uric acid levels caused by NIBV infection. In addition to being caused by insufficient urate excretion, hyperuricemia can also be caused by excessive production of uric acid [59]. We found a high level of glutamine, which enter the purine metabolic pathway as a raw material for uric acid synthesis. The high level of glutamine can be explained by two reasons. First, the lack of mRNA abundance of the gene GSS in the kidney tissue of the model group inhibited the conversion of glutamine to glutathione. A significant negative correlation between GSS and glutamine has confirmed this finding. Second, the transcription level of the gene glutamic pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) in the model group chickens\u2019 kidneys increased significantly. GPT2 is a pyridoxal enzyme that promotes the conversion of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to glutamate [60]. Of note, \u03b1-ketoglutarate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle, and glutamate can be reversibly converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase. Together, these data point to key genes and metabolites related to elevated uric acid synthesis, which provides us with new insights into host response to NIBV infection.",

It is well known that organisms fuel or instruct the immune response to pathogen threats by modulating metabolic pathways [61]. Innate and acquired immune systems are regulated by a highly interactive network of chemical communications, which include the synthesis of the antigen-presenting machinery, immunoglobulins, and cytokines. This network is highly dependent on the sufficient availability of amino acids. Thus, amino acids affect immune responses either directly or indirectly through their metabolites [62]. In our study, the correlation analysis highlighted a significant positive correlation between Tlr7 and proline, isoleucine, threonine, and valine. According to reports, isoleucine could maintain the development of immune organs and cells and stimulate the secretion of immune molecule substances in humans and animals [63,64], valine could improve dendritic cell function [65], and it has been proved in vitro that threonine plays a key role in lymphocyte proliferation and immunoglobulin production [66]. We observed an increase in the level of amino acids enriched in proline, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway, including isoleucine, valine, and threonine. Therefore, changes in these amino acid metabolism pathways may occur through the activation of innate immunity to enhance the body\u2019s antiviral response. Although there are many studies on amino acids and immunity, the modulation of amino acid metabolism in innate immune responses is still poorly known and deserves further study.",

            "text": "Previous research has confirmed that the dysfunction of the gut microbiome is tightly associated with kidney and liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis [67], liver cancer [68], and chronic kidney disease [69]. The gut microbiome incorporates a wide variety of commensal microbiota and has a large effect on the health of individuals. A community-wide effect involving the gain and loss of microbial populations and changes in general metabolic functions always occurs under pathological conditions. Our results showed that the abundance of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides vulgatus were significantly reduced in the cecal microbiota of NIBV-infected chickens based on LEfSe analysis. Similar to many other Bacteroides species, especially Bacteroides vulgatus which was shown to promote intestinal homeostasis, the Bacteroides vulgatus-mediated induction of semimature dendritic cells is associated with inflammation silencing [70,71]. Thus, decreased abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus promotes intestinal flora imbalance and activation of the immune system. Furthermore, it is well accepted that Lactobacillus may lower serum uric acid levels by reducing intestinal absorption of purines in humans [72]. Therefore, a decrease in the abundance of Lactobacillus in the caecum of the model group infected with NIBV further promoted an increase in uric acid levels in serum. The results of our correlation analysis further confirm this point, that is, the negative relationship between the abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus, Lactobacillus and the uric acid concentration. However, the mechanism of NIBV infection leading to a decrease in their abundance still needs further study. Taken together, multitudinous studies to date endorse the concept that a bloom of Proteobacteria in the gut reflects gut dysbiosis or an unstable gut microbial community [73]. In view of balanced gut microbiota with high stabilization that has symbiotic relationships with the immune system of the host, which is capable of suppressing the uncontrolled expansion of Proteobacteria, the increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria in this experiment may be closely related to the immune and metabolic changes caused by NIBV infection.",
