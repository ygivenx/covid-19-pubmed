            "text": "Despite intense research efforts over nearly three decades, only minimal progress has been made in developing an HIV-1 vaccine. In retrospect, a number of reasons can be proposed for this failure such as the enormous genetic diversity of HIV, the camouflage of the neutralizing epitopes in the envelope spike by glycan shields, the presence of \u201cdecoy\u201d immunodominant non-neutralizing antigenic determinants in non-conserved areas on the surface and the low gp120 trimer spike density on the virus membrane [1]. In addition, the most vulnerable regions may only be accessible for a short period. These short-lived structures include the so-called CD4 induced (CD4i) in gp120 and the pre-hairpin epitopes in gp41 that are only exposed following CD4 receptor binding and the subsequent conformational changes. Still, a few antibodies (Abs) are able to successfully interfere with the binding and fusion process, as seen in passive immunization studies in the macaque model. Such mAbs include 2G12 (binds to mannose residues on gp120); b12 and F105 (bind to the CD4 binding site, CD4bs); 17b and \u00d75 (recognize conformational epitopes in the CD4i region); and 4E10 and 2F5 (bind to epitopes in the membrane proximal extracellular region or MPER of gp41). Last year, however, three new mAbs (HJ16, HGN194 and HK20) were reported from African patients from the ITM HIV-1 cohort. Taken together these mAbs target three different steps in viral entry: binding to CD4bs and thus preventing interaction of HIV-1 with CD4 by HJ16, binding to V3 and blocking the coreceptor binding by HGN194 and finally immobilizing the unfolding of the gp41 by the HK20 mAb [2]. Since HK20 targets HR1 instead of MPER or glycans in this region, it has the conceptual advantage over 4E10 and 2F5 of avoiding potential auto reactivity [2], [3]. Importantly, the HGN194 mAb has recently been found to confer protection in infant rhesus monkeys by the group of Ruprecht [4].",

This assay differs from the classical \u2018short\u2019 PBMC neutralization assay by extending the incubation phase of plasma with virus from 1 to 24 hours. The importance of this format was shown in a SHIV challenge trial in rhesus macaques, where recombinant HIV envelope immunizations induced protection [5], [6]. Comparing various neutralization assays, we showed that the PBMC based assay with an extended incubation phase was able to discriminate between protected and non-protected animals after vaccination. Since we are attempting to develop a vaccine effective against a range of subtypes and because the subtype A, subtype C and circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG are responsible for at least 75% of the current new infections worldwide, we identified patients, whose plasma could cross-neutralize mainly viruses from these three subtypes in the extended incubation PBMC assay. From the blood of selected patients, memory B cells were isolated and immortalized using an Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) based procedure [7]. Supernatants of B cell clones were tested in ELISA with recombinant gp41, trimeric gp120 and gp140 proteins from several subtypes as solid phase. Clones with binding activity to any of these antigens were expanded and supernatants were tested using a HOS based PV neutralization assay. This effort ultimately resulted in the selection of the new mAbs HJ16, HGN194 and HK20, which showed considerable breadth of neutralizing activity against a panel of HIV-1 primary isolates spanning both tier 1 and tier 2 viruses of different subtypes [2].",

All isolates were classified by phylogenetic analysis of their envelope genes. All virus stocks were prepared and titrated on PHA/IL-2 stimulated PBMC. These strains have been extensively used for at least 10 years at ITM and are considered equivalent to neutralization resistant tier 2 viruses [8], [9]. Corresponding envelope PV constructs were obtained by DNA amplification of the complete env starting from PBMC co-cultures or by RT-PCR using plasma and subsequent cloning into an expression vector (pSV7d or pcDNA4/TO) [10]. These included the ITM strains VI 191 (A), VI 829 (C), VI 882 (C), VI 1358 (C), VI 824 (D), VI 1888 (CRF01), VI 1090 (CRF02), CI 20 (CRF02) and CA 18 (CRF02).

Cells are then washed and \u2018c\u2019 is the culture time in days (all at 37\u00b0C and 7% CO2). In this study results were obtained in 24/1/14, 1/2/7 and 1/24/14 formats. These are named \u2018extended incubation\u2019, \u2018short incubation\u2019 and \u2018extended absorption\u2019 assays respectively. The extended incubation assay, which was originally used for patient selection has been described previously [6], [11]. Briefly, virus stock is diluted in a five fold series from 1/2 to 1/6250 in culture medium (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 15% FCS and 200 U/ml IL-2) to establish the titer (-log10 if the dilution at which 50% infection is achieved). A titer below 1 constitutes poor growth of the virus and the experiment is discarded. Ninety \u00b5l of each virus dilution are mixed with 5 \u00b5l of plasma or 50 \u00b5g mAb. In assays testing neutralization by plasma the mixture is complemented with 5 \u00b5l culture medium to give a final 1 in 20 dilution of plasma. When testing mAb, the mixture is complemented with 5 \u00b5l flow through (IgG was removed from HIV-1 negative plasma using a Protein G column [GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Belgium]) to give 50 \u00b5g/ml of mAb. After the incubation phase 20 \u00b5l of each plasma or mAb/virus mix are first dispensed in quadruplicate into flat bottom 96-well microplates and 75,000 PBMC in 100 \u00b5l culture medium are added to each well. Plates are then left in a CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C during the absorption phase (b). Afterwards, cells are washed three times by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant is aspirated and 180 \u00b5l fresh culture medium are added to the cells. When cultured for 14 days, 125 \u00b5l of the medium is aspirated and replaced with 135 \u00b5l fresh culture medium. After c days, 200 \u00b5l of the supernatant are mixed with 50 \u00b5l Nonidet P40 (0.25% in PBS; Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, Puurs, Belgium) to disrupt virions and this mixture is analyzed for the presence of HIV p24 antigen. As a control, pooled plasma of 100 HIV-1 negative donors are tested in parallel. For the short incubation and extended absorption phase assays, times of incubation are appropriately adjusted: 1/2/7 and 1/24/14 respectively. Neutralization activities are presented as the percentage reduction in infectious titer of a virus isolate following incubation with patient plasma or mAb relative to its titer following incubation with HIV-1 negative control plasma. Virus titers were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench [12]. An 80% reduction in titer was considered significant. By extending the usual one hour absorption phase of the extended and short incubation PBMC assay to 24 hours (1/24/14 format) we aimed to reproduce the conditions of the cell line based assays where the mAbs remain during the entire absorption and culture phase.",

Luciferase reporter gene activity was quantified 48\u201372 h after infection upon cell lysis and addition of firefly luciferase substrate (Perkin-Elmer) as described. Emitted relative light units (RLUs) were quantified on a LB941 Berthold luminometer (Alabama, US). Infection of TZMbl cells was quantified using SteadyLite and infection of GHOST cells was quantified using BriteLite as a substrate (both Perkin-Elmer). In a preliminary experiment 1.104 TZMbl or GHOST cells were seeded in each well of 96-well, flat bottom plates and infected with a range of viral doses in a total volume of 200 \u00b5l to establish the dose, which resulted in a signal of 50,000 to 100,000 RLU in the presence of 10 \u00b5g/ml diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran, Sigma, Belgium) to enhance virus infectivity in TZMbl cells, while no DEAE-Dextran was used in GHOST cells. In the actual neutralization experiments, mAbs or plasma were pre-incubated with PV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The mAb concentration or plasma dilution producing a 50% reduction in luciferase reporter gene production was determined by linear regression analysis in Microsoft Office Excel as described on http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/nab-reference-strains/html/Protocol-for-Neutralizing-Antibody-Screening-Assay-for-HIV-1-in-TZM-bl-Cells-November-2010.pdf. For IC50 of mAbs, the 50% inhibitory concentrations were determined via a linear interpolation method using the mean of duplicate or triplicate cultures. The assay readouts for the dilutions above and below the IC50 were joined with a straight line, plotted against the log concentration of mAb. The position where the line crossed the 50% assay readout was taken as the IC50 estimate. Where the IC value was outside the range of concentrations tested, it was recorded as either greater than the highest concentration used, or less than the lowest concentration, as appropriate. An ID50 for plasma and IC50 for Abs were calculated from a dilution series starting from 1\u223620 for plasma and starting from 50 or 150 \u00b5g for Abs depending on the Ab used.",

In contrast, the classical short incubation phase assays as well as the extended absorption phase PBMC assays showed a reduction in the number of neutralized strains.

Cross-neutralization may require interaction between Abs acting at several epitopes. In this scenario, reproducing the range of isolates neutralized by plasma would not be possible when an average of only one to two neutralizing mAb were isolated. This would be buttressed by methods to directly determine the number of individual neutralizing antibody clones in the patient's repertoire. We will also address this issue in new studies but this has also been examined by the group of Guan and Lewis [22]. Obviously, combining more isolated mAb might correspond better to the plasma results when additive and synergistic effects between Abs could be unveiled. Unfortunately, we did not obtain more mAbs for the 242315-HJ and 529552-HK patients. Although we did obtain more mAbs from the 314994-HGN patient, none of these, except for HGN194, were neutralizing in either the HOS or TZMbl assays. Nevertheless, there may be \u2018missing Abs\u2019 as has been previously suggested by the groups of Guan and Nussenzweig [16], [22]. However, the \u2018non-neutralizing\u2019 mAbs may still be relevant in the wider context since they could have other effector mechanisms such as Ab-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI) or Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through their Fc\u03b3Rs [23], [24], [25].",

In the Walker study [17], it was shown that the most potent Abs did not bind in an ELISA and even Abs that did bind had a low neutralizing profile. The inference was that specific quaternary protein structures should be used in a primary screening. This issue is being addressed with the most recent samples under interrogation at IRB within our consortium. It should also be noted that the Abs in the plasma probably originate in the plasma cells of the bone marrow while the mAbs are isolated from memory B cells in the circulation. These two cell populations may not produce the same range of Abs. It should be possible to culture individual plasma cells, clone their heavy and light chain variable regions and identify the IgG or IgA repertoires produced.",

Since HK20 recognizes an epitope in the gp41 region this could partially be explained by the high level of CCR5 expression on the TZMbl cells making it more difficult for anti-gp41 Abs to be effective [2], [29].

It remains elusive whether the HJ16, HGN194 and HK20 mAbs would have been obtained from other patients. HK20 like Abs have been detected through ELISA and although the neutralizing capacity of this fraction was not shown it still provides proof that a significant number of HIV-1 infected patients have responded to the gp41-HR1 region which is only briefly exposed [2], [3].",

Although many groups have tried to identify which neutralization assay can predict in vivo protection, this issue is still open to debate [33]. In several SIV and SHIV macaque studies neutralizing mAbs have correlated with protection [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], but there are also multiple counter examples [44], [45]. In this context, the most compelling demonstration that pre-existing Abs can be protective comes from passive immunization studies with either IgG or mAbs [28], [34], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [46], [47], [48], [49]. The most recent study uses the HGN194 mAb against a SHIV strain containing an \u2018early\u2019 envelope and emphasizes the importance of potent neutralizing Abs that confer protection against a heterologous mucosal challenge [4]. The latter is highly significant since future vaccines will need to be effective against these relatively resistant early founder strains before infection is established in vivo [50].",

It is quite evident that different neutralization assays yield different results and it is still unclear which one is most predictive or suited to obtain neutralizing mAbs. Nevertheless, the strategy used for selection of plasma (in an extended incubation PBMC assay) and selection of mAb (based on ELISA binding and neutralizing capacity in a HOS_PV assay) yielded interesting new mAbs. A better understanding of in vitro neutralization characterizations of patient plasma and Abs and will hopefully lead to more effective ways of discovering new Abs that ultimately can be used for HIV-1 immunogen design and subsequent vaccine development.",
