The infectious prion forms (PrPSc) represent the misfolded normal proteins (PrPC) and were shown to be infectious, since then can self-propagate and interact with the endogenous PrPC, catalyzing their conversion into pathological PrPSc3\u20137. Previously they had been primarily known as the inducers of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, however, today they have been shown to be involved in the development of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases8\u201310.",

One of these approaches is prion-like amino acid composition (PLAAC) analysis, which allows the evaluation of proteins containing PrDs, defined as domains with the compositional similarity to yeast prion domains, based on amino-acid interactions27,31. The resulting log-likelihood ratio (LLR) indicates the possibility that the analyzed protein is a prion. Using PLAAC algorithms, PrDs defined as domains shown to contain at least a domain compositionally similar to yeast prions, have recently been investigated in different eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, confirming their important regulatory and functional roles20,32\u201334. There are other algorithms, such as PAPA and PrionW, using an experimentally derived prion propensity score combined with explicit consideration of the intrinsic disorder, that help to predict prion domains bioinformatically35\u201338. Recently, we investigated the PrDs in phagobiota and determined that these domains can be found in bacterial and archaeal virus families, which increased our understanding of their possible interplay with microbiota and implication for human health39.",

The output probabilities for the PrDs states in the PLAAC were constructed based on the amino-acid frequencies in the PrDs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Consequently, this basis can be altered, using the parameter \u201cAlpha value\u201d, which allows a continuous interpolation between organism-specific background frequencies (Alpha = 0.0) and S. cerevisiae background frequencies (Alpha = 1.0).

The majority of data received by the PAPA, was overlapping with PLAAC algorithm, which is in agreement with previous studies, showing that PLAAC and PAPA commonly overlap as both programs were trained on prion proteins of S. cerevisiae38. However, there were certain differences, and some PrDs that had high PLAAC score were found to be below the 0.05 cutoff of PAPA algorithm. Such a discrepancy can be explained by the fact that although both of these programs have a high level of prediction accuracy for prion and non-prion protein determination, the precision of the analysis is below 100%35,36.",

We identified the PrDs in the viral surface proteins that are involved in the direct contact and fusion of viruses with the host cell membrane, indicating that PrDs may be functionally implicated in these processes as well. Moreover, a similar trend was previously noted in the distribution of PrDs in proteins responsible for the bacterial and bacteriophage interactions39. Interestingly, most PrDs were found in Baculoviridae, the rod-shaped viruses. We identified PrDs in 56 out of 66 known species belonging this family, indicating that this high prevalence of PrDs in one viral family may not be a coincidence. Therefore, we further showed that one of the PrDs associated with the cell adhesion and entry most frequently found in Baculoviridae is occlusion-derived virus envelope protein 66 (ODV-E66), which was recently the first identified viral chondroitin lyase, an enzyme that degrades chondroitin and is associated with viral entry65,66.",

This may be explained by the presence of cell wall in the plant and fungal cells, requiring different mechanism of viral entry67. Plant viruses are known to have no specific mechanisms of entry, but instead they take advantage of the plant injury, vectors such as insects, or through a cell-to-cell movement of viral progeny in the infected plant68,69.

The presence of PrDs in viral assembly proteins is most likely important for the capsid assembly, which is known to be characterized by the nucleation-and-growth mechanism, dependent on the capsid assembly kinetics75. Therefore, the glutamine-rich motifs, which mediate protein-protein interactions and have greater potential for the kinetic conformational diversity, in capsid assembly proteins may determine the pathways of capsid protein complex assembly76. The majority of PrDs in the assembly proteins were found in the enveloped viruses, while PrDs in the structural proteins were predominantly identified in the non-enveloped ones. Further analyses indicated the PrD enrichment in the assembly proteins, such as adenoviral major capsid proteins hexons, found in different members of Adenoviridae, including human adenovirus serotype 40 (AdV40)77.",

Therefore, the discovery of PrDs in proteins associated with viral capsid growth indicates a possible role of these prionogenic properties in viral assembly. An indirect reference to that is that human cytomegalovirus capsid scaffolding protein, which plays an essential structural role in assembling the viral capsid, was identified in the current study as having a PrD, and in recent work by Vernon, R. et al., it was shown to be associated with phase separation88.",

Only enterovirus B were shown to have the PrDs in both polyprotein and capsid protein VP1.

We observed consistent PrD distribution patterns in different viral families and species, and these domains were identified in a variety of proteins.
