Two days later, a SARS Steering Committee was convened in Hamilton, Ontario, linking Public Health and Community Services (PHCS) with other partners (Table 1). Hamilton is located about 70 kilometers west of Toronto, which was the centre of the outbreak. Information management was critical during the crisis. Communication from the Ontario Provincial Operations Centre proceeded through email and fax to hospitals, long-term care facilities, health units, and the Ontario Medical Association. Simultaneously, information came from the World Health Organization (WHO), Health Canada, other health units and health care partners. The multi-source nature of the information made it difficult to manage and synthesize the most current, accurate information in a timely fashion. In addition, information impacting health units and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) might have reached only hospital staff. Directives changed often, necessitating version control measures to ensure that everyone was working from the most recent documents. This situation was difficult to manage with emails as updates were often sent daily and document file sizes were too large to send. A decision was made to develop a single, limited-access web-based system to manage constantly changing local and provincial SARS control information.",

The Extranet was developed to support the SARS steering committee in disseminating to partners comprehensive information that was timely, current, accurate and relevant. The Extranet also supported the implementation of local strategies using a secure accessible and managed centralized access point. SARS steering committee members (N = 53) received a common ID and password to access the site. The site did not require users to connect through a Virtual Private Network (VPN), nor was there any validation of IP addresses to validate users. The Extranet, however, was viewed as a private network using the Internet to securely share information with partners. The security aspects made it an Extranet.",

Ideally, participatory design principles, [8,9] would have been used to design the site, but there was no time to actively involve end users or track the costs to set up and maintain the site. Set-up and maintenance of the site was estimated to require one programmer (100 hours @ $40/hr), one Information Architect and Business/Technical Liaison (95 hours @ $50/hr), and one communicable disease expert (10 hours @ $75/hr) over the twelve weeks the Extranet was in use (total = $9,500).",

A three-member observation team tested the web survey with four PHCS employees who were familiar with the SARS Extranet and comfortable using the web. Instructions were given to each participant based on a think-aloud protocol, [10-14]. Participants were asked to complete the web survey, while observers took notes. Participants were instructed to think out loud, make statements, or ask questions as they made their way through the survey. They were informed that observers would not respond, but that observers would benefit from hearing their comments and watching their actions. Observers noted problems spoken and/or observed, which were later discussed in a debriefing session after each test. They participated in a final debriefing session to identify problems that occurred with more than one participant; this process provided direction for survey improvements. Several minor survey modifications were made prior to the launch. The online survey form was dynamic and, depending on how a respondent replied to one question, determined the next series of questions. Thus, changes identified through the think-aloud technique related to branching of questions (If yes, go here; If no, go there). No other significant issues were identified. The paper-based survey was also modified slightly to match the web version.",

Respondents indicated that they wanted future Extranets to support private email to experts as well as have a bulletin board for feature use, validating our conjecture that they would prefer more interactivity. Two-way communication features may be important features to consider in the creation of future Extranet solutions so as to enhance interactivity. Further research is needed to measure the perceived value and impact of interactive technologies. In addition to having synchronous communication modes, such as a discussion board or email link, web-conferencing and real-time online communication using text chat may provide more effective interactive web-based solutions.",

An administrator likely views the use of email as part of his or her daily routine activity, but does not view searching web sites as a routine. Information is automatically 'pushed' to users in email, whereas users need to actively seek information from an Internet site. Furthermore, a web site is typically less interactive than email, with which users can easily reply to senders. Although the Hamilton Extranet had an email link, it was not used. The Extranet was likely not perceived by users as a two-way communication tool but, rather, a place to find information.",

Despite this finding, the majority rated the Hamilton Extranet high overall, considering its own merits. Possible reasons for this positive opinion may be extrapolated from the findings: Given the most common reasons for visiting the site, the Extranet was perceived as useful to support local information needs such as meeting minutes, and Hamilton directives. In addition, until the provincial SARS site was launched, the Hamilton Extranet was the only source of provincial information. Once the MOHLTC website was launched, redundancy with Extranet information was inevitable; our findings supported this view. Also, provincial MoHLTC staff may not have been interested in specific local issues.",

Governance structures are needed to set guidelines about the practice of sharing passwords.

The survey was conducted three months after the initial SARS outbreak, so participants may not have accurately recalled their use of the site. This uncertainty is further complicated by the wide variety of SARS sites. The lack of statistical significance may be a result of the small size of the respondents. Finally, because the Extranet was developed quickly, it was not possible to plan for a rigorous evaluation. Qualitative evaluation methods would have been useful to answer questions about why participants rated the Hamilton site lower than other sites. Given more time for planning, set-up, and design of the Extranet, long-and short-term objectives would have been developed from which to frame a program evaluation. A more accurate system for tracking individual use would also have been incorporated. Better assessment of the human and financial costs of running the Extranet would have been a useful measure against the perceived value of the Extranet.",

It is likely that more interactivity in web-based communication solutions would enhance their use and value. Although the CDC, WHO, and federal and provincial sources of SARS health information on the Internet were rated higher than that on the Hamilton Extranet, a local area Extranet appears to have an important role in supporting local information sharing and communication in an emergency situation. There is a need, however, for anticipatory planning, coordination and development of an Extranet communication system to ensure we are prepared for the next public health emergency. In addition, the findings indicate that users envisioned an expanded role of a local Extranet to support public health communication and education beyond the management of emergencies.
