Since HBoV seroepidemiology in subspecialty clinics or hospitalized patients may not be representative of an overall seropositivity rate of the population, we enrolled healthy children in a prospective manner. While seroepidemiology in healthy vs hospitalized children was different, with more hospitalized children being exposed to HBoV than healthy children, this was found to be directly related to the age of the populations.

Regrettably, our study was performed prior to the discovery that HBoV has specific subtypes.
