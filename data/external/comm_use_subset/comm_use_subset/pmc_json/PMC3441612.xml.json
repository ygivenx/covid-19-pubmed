Recent outbreaks of new influenza strains like the H1N1 [1] and the H5N5 flu or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [2], which are characterized by a high rate of mortality and/or fast propagation velocity, motivate the development of epidemic models that capture the main features of the spread of those diseases. In particular, mathematical tools applied to model epidemics are very important since they allow to understand how a disease impact on the society, helping to develop new policies to slow down its spreading.",

            "text": "One of the simplest models that reproduce seasonal diseases, such as influenza, is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [3], [4], which has been the subject of extensive theoretical and numerical research on complex networks [3]. In the SIR model the individuals can be in one of three states, susceptible, infected or recovered. In its discrete formulation [5]\u2013[7], at each time step, infected individuals infect their susceptible neighbors with probability  and recover at a fixed time  since they were infected, called recovery time. According to these rules, the disease spreads on the contact network until it reaches the steady state where there are only susceptible and recovered individuals. It was found that the steady state of the SIR model can be mapped into a link percolation problem which provides a theoretical framework to study this process [6], [8]\u2013[10]. It is known that the size of the infection, defined as the fraction of recovered individuals at the steady state, is governed by the effective probability of infection or transmissibility  of the disease which depends on  and . In the SIR model, the size of the infection is the order parameter of a second order phase transition with a critical threshold transmissibility . Below  the disease is an outbreak, where the infection reaches a small fraction of the population while above  an epidemic develops exactly as in a link percolation process [6], [8]\u2013[10]. In uncorrelated infinite networks this threshold is given by \n[6], [11], where  is the branching factor of the network, and  and  are the first and the second moment, respectively, of the degree distribution . Here,  is the degree or number of links that a node can have with . For Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi networks (ER), the degree distribution is  and the threshold is found at . However, most of the real networks have a heterogeneous degree distribution that is better represented by a pure Scale-Free network (SF) with , where  measures the broadness of the distribution. In the thermodynamic limit, for SF networks with ,  and as a consequence, the critical transmissibility  which means that the epidemic spreads for any value of \n[6], [11]. However, due to finite size effects, real networks have finite critical transmisibilities.",

On the other hand, Valdez \n[13] showed that  is an important parameter to determine the efficiency of a mitigation or control strategy, because any strategy that decrease the transmissibility below , can protect a large and connected cluster of susceptible individuals.

            "text": "Even though percolation theory was very useful to describe the steady state of the SIR model on complex networks, it is still very challenging to explain the dynamics of the model to develop intervention strategies before the epidemic spreads to a large fraction of the population. To describe the dynamics of epidemic spreading on networks, recently some researchers developed differential rate equations for the SIR model that take into account the network topology. Lindquist \n[14] introduced an \u201ceffective degree\u201d approach through a large system of ordinary differential equations. Under this approach, the nodes and their neighbors are categorized by their disease state (susceptible, infected, recovered) and each differential equation compute the evolution of the fraction of susceptible or infected nodes with a number  and  of infected and susceptible neighbors, respectively, with  and . As a result, a system with  equations needs to be solved. This approach represents accurately the evolution of the number of infected individuals, but at a high computational cost. On the other hand, Miller [15] and Miller \n[16], [17] proposed an ingenious approach to describe the evolution of a SIR process with rates by means of an edge-based compartmental model (EBCM) [15], [16] which has the advantage to describe the dynamical spreading of an epidemic with only a few equations. With these equations, the authors found accurate results for the evolution of the number of infected individuals for static and dynamic evolutive topologies like \u201cedge swapping\u201d and \u201cdormant contacts\u201d for transmissibilities above the critical threshold [16].",

Understanding this problem is important because the network composed by the healthy individuals is the network that sustains the functionality of a society, e.g. the economy of a region. In this paper we present a novel idea for the SIR model, based on a dynamical study of the network composed by susceptible individuals. We show that the temporal decreasing of the size of the giant susceptible cluster can be described as a dynamic void node percolation process with an instantaneous void control parameter. We find that there exists a critical time  above which the giant susceptible component overcomes a temporal second order phase transition with mean field exponents. The paper is organized as following: in Methods and Results we present the theoretical framework to derive the evolution equations. Then we study the evolution of the giant susceptible cluster and its temporal critical behavior. Finally we present our conclusions.",

As a consequence, for large generations  can also be interpreted as the probability that a void cluster loses a node. However, in this kind of percolation process the void nodes are not killed at random, instead they are removed following a link. We call this type of percolation \u201cnode void percolation\u201d. If we denote by  the probability that a void node is removed due to the occupancy of a link, at the steady state the following relation holds(8)Then  is the probability that a void node is not removed due to the fact that the link has not been traversed. Thus,  is equivalent to  because the void nodes correspond to the susceptible individuals in the steady state. As in any percolation process, there is a critical probability  at which the void network undergoes a second order phase transition. Above  a giant void component exist while at and below  void nodes belong only to finite components. In epidemic terms, this means that at  only finite susceptible clusters can be reached. As a consequence, the fraction of links  needed to reach this point fulfills [13]\n(9)Therefore, from Eqs. (7) and (9) we obtain(10)where  is the solution of Eq. (10).

All our theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the simulations. Our findings are very interesting from an epidemiological point of view since the existence of a threshold time implies that when a very virulent disease reaches a small number of susceptible individuals, the authorities have only a limited time to intervene, in order to protect a big community (susceptible giant component) that has not been already reached by the epidemic, and to preserve the topological features of SF networks.
