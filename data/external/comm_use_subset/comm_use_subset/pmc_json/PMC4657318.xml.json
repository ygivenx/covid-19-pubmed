According to the viral envelope glycoprotein antigenic structure, host range and mutual interference between different strains cultured in cells, ALV can be classified as ten subgroups, A-J. Subgroups A-E and J exist in chickens. ALV- A, B and J are the most common exogenous subgroups that cause chicken tumors, but subgroups C, D appear to be rare [1]. Subgroup E is an endogenous leukosis virus, which has low or no pathogenicity to chickens directly, but studies have shown that chickens infected with ALV-E remained viremic with exogenous virus longer and developed neoplasm at a much higher frequency than did the control chickens not infected with ALV-E [2]. For best results, all the common ALV subgroups needed to be eradicated from the chicken breeder flocks. Currently, to determine these pathogens in large quantities, a preliminary test is done to see whether ALVs exist and then, if necessary, primers specified for every subgroup are used to detect the positive samples.",

Over the past decade, many myeloid tumor cases induced by ALV have been reported, especially involving ALV-J [3]. At first, it was only found in white meat-type breeders. Later, it was discovered that there were a growing number of AL cases in layers and local meat-type chickens. Over the past major economic losses were reported [4]. In recent years, the reports of leukemia/ hemangioma in post-laying chickens have increased significantly all over the country. Virus isolation and identification showed that leukemia/ hemangioma is mainly caused by ALV-J, but chickens are coinfected with the ALV-A or/and ALV-B at the same time [5]. In conclusion, ALV-A, ALV-B, and ALV-J were identified as the most common ALVs pathogens in the poultry industry and ALV-E co-infection was found to increase the pathogenicity of exogenous infection. An eradication program for ALVs has been developed and is being used on quite a few chicken farms in China since the NEP started in 2008. Unlike in the United States, where there are relatively few major breeding companies, in China there are more smaller poultry breeding companies and many of these produce \u201cyellow chickens\u201d of local breeds. These companies are in great need of an eradication program for ALV, but, in fact, they lack the money, technology and professional staff to obtain one. It appears that only a simple, rapid, and inexpensive detection assay would be suitable for these companies.",

However, while these methods for specific, sensitive, and rapid diagnosis appear to be promising, PCR requires skilled personnel and specialized high-cost instruments to observe the test results [7]. Virus isolation is the gold standard method for the detection of ALV, but it is very difficult to see this as practical in most of the smaller poultry breeding companies because it would require skilled personnel and specialized high-cost instruments. Also, it takes about 7\u20139 days after CEFs or DF-1 cell cultures are infected by the virus before they can be detected. In addition the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) based on the cell cultures takes further time. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit targeting the viral group-specific antigen (p27) was used in some large poultry breeder farms of China by those wanting to establish exogenous ALV-free breeder flocks when the NEP started. But, this assay is expensive for smaller companies and is time-consuming, especially if there is no costly ELISA plate-washing machine. Also, it results in a considerable proportion of false-positive results because some endogenous retroviruses like EAV-HP family may express p27. Therefore, the ELISA assay is not practical in all cases [8]. As a result, there is high demand for simple, simple and rapid molecular tests to supplement existing methods.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed by Notomi et al [9], based upon nucleic acid specificity and rapid amplification and has developed into a competitive molecular biology tool due to its specificity, simplicity, speed, and economical efficiency. The LAMP reaction is carried out at a constant temperature without the DNA template denaturation, annealing, and extension PCR cycles in a specific instrument [10]. In addition, the results can be easily identified through the naked eye [11]. The LAMP assay has been widely applied in clinical diagnosis of epidemic viruses [12\u201314], bacteria [15\u201317] and parasites [18], as well as in sex determination of embryos [19] and other applications. Although there was already a LAMP assay for rapid detection of ALV-J reported [20], the NEP for ALV in China needed to detect all the common subgroups of exogenous ALVs including the most common subgroups A, B, E and J and to eradicate them as possible in the production of poultry. Compared with the existing methods, the most efficient process may be a preliminary test showing whether any ALVs exist, and then if necessary, the use of primers specified for every subtype to detect the positive samples further. Thus, we have developed a LAMP assay for the simple, sensitive, and rapid detection of all the common ALV subgroups found in chickens, with the goal of helping to improve the NEP. First, we designed four sets of primers for common ALVs detection and optimized the reaction conditions of LAMP. Secondly, the specificity and sensitivity of the LAMP assay were evaluated. Finally, the reliability of the LAMP assay was evaluated on the detection of 81 clinical samples and compared to the conventional PCR method and virus isolation method. To ensure the accuracy of the results the assay was real-time monitored by the Loopamp real-time turbidimeter (LA320-C, Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 400 nm [21].",

Besides observations by real-time turbidimetry, we also used visual inspection to determine a positive reaction in a temperature-controlled water bath. After addition of commercial calcein dye to the terminated reaction at about 35 min when the LAMP reaction terminated according to the optimized conditions by real-time turbidimetry, the results were obtained with UV light trans-illumination.

The concentration of the plasmid was judged by a UV spectrophotometer (Beckman UV-800, Beckman Coulter, USA). According to Lamien\u2019s method [22] , the copy number was calculated as follows: number of copies = [amount (ng) \u00d7 6.022 \u00d7 1023]/[length(plasmid + insert) \u00d7 1 \u00d7 109 \u00d7 650]. The plasmid containing the ALV-J pol gene fragment was serially diluted from 2 \u00d7 100 to 2 \u00d7 107 copies/\u03bcl. Then the sensitivity of the LAMP assay was compared with the conventional PCR method. The plasmids concentration was subjected to the LAMP assay and routine PCR respectively. The results showed that the detection limit of the LAMP assay monitored by real-time turbidimetry was about 20 copies (Fig. 3). The detection limit of the LAMP assay by direct visual detection was also 20 copies (Fig. 4). Therefore, we concluded that these two LAMP detection methods had the same sensitivity. For comparison purposes, PCR using ALV-F3 and ALV-B3 primers was also carried out. We observed that the limit of the PCR was 200 copies (Fig. 5). Then we repeated sensitivity test 2 times. There were no apparent differences in the least detectable amount except slight differences which could be neglected in the detection time. Consequently, the sensitivity of this LAMP assay was at least 10 times higher than that of the routine PCR method.",

ALV- A, B, E and J are the most common pathogenic subgroups. An effective medication or vaccine against these ALVs is not currently available. As a result, the control or preventive procedures of ALV infections mainly depends upon early detection and limitation of the virus carriers to prevent the vertical and horizontal transmission. Virus isolation is regarded as the golden standard method for ALV diagnosis. However, it requires skilled personnel knowing complex cell culture procedures and obtaining the results takes more than 1 week [27]. It is too difficult to apply for the numerous smaller or mid-sized poultry breeding companies in China as opposed to the fewer, larger firms in the USA and many European countries. The p27 antigen ELISA assay is routinely used for the ALV diagnosis, but it also is expensive and time-consuming [28]. These are the reasons we have developed a specific, sensitive, inexpensive and real-time monitored LAMP assay for the detection of major ALV subgroups infected in chickens. This is the first report on the LAMP method being used for the rapid detection of the common ALVs.",

By evaluating the sensitivity of the LAMP assay, we observed that the LAMP assay was 10-fold more sensitive than the conventional PCR assay. In addition, the LAMP reaction was carried out in a constant temperature environment, and temperature cycling is not required. So even using the temperature-controlled water bath could provide a heat stabile condition, while the higher precision of the PCR instruments is necessary for the PCR. Furthermore, using real-time turbidimetry provides a real-time display of the reaction condition, assuring less chance of contamination. Moreover, LAMP assay primers can specifically recognize a target sequence by 4 or 6 of the 6 or 8 independent target sequence regions, compared to PCR primers that recognize target sequences by two independent regions. Therefore, the LAMP assay is the most suitable technique for rapid detection of ALVs in clinical samples, especially for preliminary testing to determine whether ALVs exist.",

These samples were detected by the LAMP assay and by PCR and virus isolation methods. The positive rates were 77.8 % (63/81), 65.4 % (53/81), and 46.1 % (37/81) as determined respectively by the LAMP assay, conventional PCR, and virus isolation. Forty-four samples, previously described as being ALV-negative by means of using virus isolation were further analyzed by the LAMP assay and PCR. The results showed that 26 and 19 ALV-positive samples were detected, respectively. It is suggested that the sensitivity of the LAMP assay was the highest among the three methods. In fact, when the cells are cultured to the second generation, four cases of the cell culture supernatants, which judged negative by virus isolation but judged positive by both LAMP and PCR, showed positive results detected by ELISA again (data not shown). This is a normal phenomenon in regular virus isolate, because one limitation is that only samples containing live virus can be detected and sometimes samples containing just a minute amount virus need continuously passaging to grow to enough amount for detection. However, conventional PCR and the LAMP assay can detect both live viruses and replication-deficient viruses. Seven more samples were positively detected by the LAMP assay than the conventional PCR. It is suggested that the sensitivity of the LAMP assay was better than that of the PCR method in this application. In comparison to PCR as the current reference method, the SEN was 100 %, SPC was 73.7 %, PPV was 84.1 % and NPV was 100 % for the LAMP assay. For the ELISA assay, the SEN was only 76.8 %, NPV was 63.6 %. This indicated that false negative judgments cannot be avoided when using the ELISA assay but the LAMP assay can detect ALV at high sensitivity. In a sense, none of the assays is entirely acuracte. The eradication program for AL however needs assays with a higher sensitivity. The LAMP assay presented here meets this requirement and could help to avoid the spread of ALV caused by false-negative judgments.",
