            "text": "B cell hybridomas have been an important source of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) since the initial production in the 1970s [1]. The most common approach for producing hybridomas has been to fuse B cells from mice hyper-immunized with the antigen with a myeloma B cell line lacking hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The fusion mixture is then seeded into 96-well plates and the hybridomas are selected with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) containing medium, which kills the unfused myeloma cells. Unfused B cells can\u2019t proliferate in vitro and finally die. Only the fused hybridoma cells can survive HAT selection and divide. Most commonly, supernatants from wells showing hybridoma growth are screened for antigen-specific antibody using antigen coated ELISA plates. The cells from positive wells are then sub-cloned at limiting dilution and retested to be sure of monoclonality.",

            "text": "Over the years, many useful mouse monoclonal antibodies have been successfully made by this fusion and screening method. However, it has two major shortcomings. First, mice hyperimmunized with soluble proteins not only produce antibodies specific for the native protein, but also those specific for epitopes unique to the denatured protein, especially when adjuvants such as Freund\u2019s adjuvant or alum are used in the immunization [2,3]. While these latter antibodies can be useful for detection of denatured protein in western blotting; the antibodies specific for native antigen have a much wider range of applications, including in vivo therapeutic reagents, as well as sandwich ELISA assays, histology, flow cytometry, immune precipitation and x-ray crystallography. Assays performed with antigen-coated ELISA wells generally can\u2019t distinguish antibodies that recognize the native vs. denatured form of antigen protein, since absorption to ELISA plates denatures some of the protein due to the hydrophobic interaction between the plate surface and protein [4]. The second shortcoming is the traditional mAb selection method is labor and time consuming with several rounds of plate seeding and selection before the antibody can be fully characterized.",

We captured potential antigen-specific mAbs from hybridoma culture supernatants within flow cells of a BIAcore BIAsensor chip, each containing an immobilized anti-Fc antibody specific for an individual mouse IgG isotype, with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signal identifying the mAb isotype. The captured mAb was tested for its ability to bind the native antigen, following the binding kinetics with SPR from which the mAb affinity was estimated. We also found that mouse hybridoma cells secreting IgG antibodies have a surface form of IgG that lacks Ig\u03b1 but binds antigen normally. We used fluorescent antigen bound to this surface IgG to single cell sort hybridoma cells secreting mAbs specific for native antigen.",

They were previously scored to bind to OVA protein coated on standard ELISA plates. However, when these mAbs were captured via their Fc within the anti-IgG\u03b31 Fc flowcell (Fig 1B and 1C), subsequently injected native OVA bound to the HO1 mAb, but not the HO14 mAb, showing that the HO14 epitope was not present on the native OVA protein. Furthermore, since OVA is a monovalent antigen, the binding kinetics, followed via the SPR signal, could be analyzed to estimate the affinity of the HO1 mAb binding to native OVA (Fig 1C).

H71 was an IgG\u03b31 mAb and H22 and M1 were IgG\u03b32a mAbs. We used the BIAcore system to determine whether these mAbs recognize the same or different epitopes on the antigen protein. When tested separately all three mAbs bound the native MBP (Fig 2A). To test whether these antibodies recognize different epitopes on MBP, H71 antibody was first captured on the chip and native MBP was injected and bound by H71 antibody. H22 and M1 antibody were then injected in sequence (Fig 2B). The MBP bound to the H71 mAb subsequently failed to bind the H22 mAb, indicating that its epitope was blocked by the H71 mAb. However the M1 mAb bound well to the H71 captured MBP, indicating its epitope was well separated from that of H71 (Fig 2C). This type data can allow for the rapid identification of pairs of mAbs that can be useful in developing a sandwich ELISA assay. Fig 2D shows standard sandwich ELISA data using wells coated with purified H71 mAb to capture various concentrations of MBP, which were subsequently detected with M1 mAb, but not with H22 mAb.",

S161 and 2A8 are two IgG\u03b32a mAb specific for the Spike protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). When either of these two mAbs was captured in an anti-IgG\u03b32a Fc flowcell, both bound injected native Spike protein.

This has also been documented in mAb secreted B cell hybridomas [9]. We confirmed this observation in our hybridomas that were produced with the Sp2/0 myeloma fusion partner by successfully staining the cells with various fluorescent anti-IgG Fc reagents (Fig 3A). We also demonstrated the presence of the membrane form of the heavy chain mRNA in the hybridomas, although at a level much reduced from that of the secreted form (Fig 3B). Interestingly, we could not detect the expression of Ig\u03b1, one of the surface IgG associated molecules involved in B cell signaling [10], in either Sp2/0 or any of our IgG producing hybridomas, suggesting that these surface IgGs are not signaling receptors (S1 Fig).",

We found that not all of the cells had expression of surface IgG (Fig 4A). However, after sorting the hybridoma cells with or without surface IgG expression respectively, we could only detect antibody secretion from hybridoma cells with surface IgG expression (Fig 4B). Furthermore, when the heterogeneous hybridoma cells were sub-cloned at limiting dilution, only those clones that secreted antibody had surface IgG expression (Fig 4C). This shows that the cell surface IgG expression on our Sp2/0 derived mouse hybridoma cells correlates with their ability to secrete mAbs of the same isotype. Others have suggested antigen specific hybridomas selected by cell surface Ig expression are more stable antibody secretors compared with traditional plate selected hybridomas [11].",

Since the fusion to the myeloma cells is not selective, many of the resulting HAT resistant hybridomas do not produce mAb specific for the immunizing antigen. Therefore all wells with growing hybridomas must be screened for the mAb specificity. Also, problems can arise when a miscalculation of the cell dilution results in wells with multiple HAT resistant hybridoma cells, only one of which is secreting the desired mAb. Furthermore, since after fusion initial daughter cells of the fused hybridoma cell tend to lose chromosomes, progeny in a well arise that is no longer secreting the mAb.

The remaining cells were then stained with anti-IgG to identify the IgG producing hybridomas and also with the fluorescent OVA reagent to identify those specific for OVA. Cells positive for both antibodies occurred with a frequency of less 0.3% of the live cell population (Fig 6B). Single double positive cells were sorted into individual culture wells of three microculture plates and, after 10 days supernatants of the resulting colonies were tested for OVA specific IgG secretion. This selection method is efficient and accurate, as 50% of wells had hybridoma cells growing in them and nearly 90% of these secreted IgG antibodies binding the native antigen (Table 2). Since almost all of the clones secreted IgG\u03b31 antibody, we randomly selected 6 clones for VH and VL sequencing. Five of the six clones had the same VH and VL sequence suggesting at least some clonal outgrowth during the bulk culture (data not shown). As a negative control we also single cell sorted one plate of surface IgG positive, but OVA negative clones. All 40 of the resulting colonies secreted IgG, but only one secreted antibody binding the native OVA. This hybridoma cell was later found to be positively stained by OVA. The sorting of this hybridoma cell might be due to a system error. Thus, this selection method greatly improved the detection and selection of hybridomas producing mAb binding to the native form of the immunizing antigen prior to initial screening for antibody specificity.",

These types of in vitro affinity maturation experiments are most often done via IgG surface display on phage or yeast [18]. While these systems allow for the construction of very large libraries, not all antibodies express well in these organisms [19]. This problem would be circumvented with B cell hybridoma surface expression and modern retroviral expression systems also allow for large scale mutant libraries. Moreover, the simultaneous surface expression and secretion of the mAb would make it immediately available for in vitro and in vivo functional experiments.",
