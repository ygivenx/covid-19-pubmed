Some vaccines and treatments have been developed, including imino sugar derivatives [3], DNA vaccines [4], interferon treatment, and human monoclonal antibodies [5]. The clinical evaluation of hE16 and other mAb therapeutics for flavivirus infections should monitor for the selection or emergence of resistant variants, especially in immunocompromised patients who are a likely target population for the treatment of severe WNV infections [6]. The use of a large dose of ribavirin inhibited WNV replication in vitro [7]; however, it was less efficient in vivo\u2014the mortality of the hamsters infected with WNV increased after the ribavirin injection [8]. The WNV RNA replication process is inhibited in vitro by mycophenolate (another candidate inhibitor) [9], which showed no protective effect in vivo. Another clinical study indicated that interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) could be protective against WNV infection [10]; however, only limited evidence has shown that IFN-\u03b1 could cure patients with serious WNV encephalitis.",

However, vaccine immunizations might not protect patients who have already developed WNV neuroinvasion. As of now, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for human use. In the study of Engle and Diamond, they found that immune mouse antibodies cannot be directly used in humans due to the heterogeneity of intact mouse IgG, which has the risk of inducing an allergic response in humans; human IgGs are not readily available in large quantities [12]. Passive immunotherapy has been proven useful for many infectious diseases. The administration of polyclonal immunoglobulins from hyperimmune animals or humans has controlled hepatitis B virus (HBV) [13] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [14]. The equine antibodies\u2014especially the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments with reduced heterogeneity\u2014are polyclonal, easy to purify in large quantities, and relatively inexpensive and successfully used to prevent Rabies virus infection [15] and snake venom in humans [16,17]. They can serve as a useful preparedness for WNV pandemic.",

To avoid potential allergic responses, pepsin was used to digest the antibodies and to generate the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. The protective efficacy of the serum IgG and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments against WNV was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The serum IgG and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments neutralized WNV infection in tissue culture, as determined by a plaque reduction assay. Furthermore, prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of mice with purified IgG or F(ab\u2032)2 fragments significantly decreased the viral loads in the spleens and brains of WNV-infected mice, and reduced mortality. These results indicate that equine immunoglobulin and equine neutralizing F(ab\u2032)2 passive immunotherapy could be potentially useful for the treatment of patients infected with WNV.",

After washing with PBST, 100 \u03bcL of the substrate 3,3\u2019,3,5\u2019-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcL of 0.5 M H2SO4. The optical density (OD) values were measured using a 96-well ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm (Bio-Rad, Los Angeles, CA, USA). The titer results were indicated as the reciprocal of the serum maximum dilution multiple, as the ratio of positive OD value to negative OD value was more than 2.",

After WNV infection, all wild type (WT) mice receiving the immune IgG or F(ab\u2032)2 survived, whereas 30%\u201340% of WT mice receiving the control horse IgG died, regardless of whether the antibodies were administered before or after the infection. The mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) is a key adaptor molecule in the RIG (Retinoic Acid-inducible Gene)-I-like receptor RNA-sensing pathway [23]; Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice were highly susceptible and uniformly succumbed to WNV infection, with death occurring by 11 days (Figure 4C\u2013E) [18]. However, 50% of the Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice that received the horse IgG one day before the infection survived. In contrast, in the in vitro neutralizing assays (Figure 3C,D), the mice that received the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments showed delayed mortality; however, 100% of these mice died within 15 days (Figure 4C). An immune antibody transfer one day after the infection was not protective in the Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4D). Furthermore, to determine whether two doses of the equine antibody treatment could enhance the prophylactic function in Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice, we treated mice both one day before and one day after WNV infection. All Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice from the control group died, whereas 90% of mice that received the horse immune IgG survived; the F(ab\u2032)2 treatment protected only 30% of the mice. Next, we asked whether a passive transfer of the equine immune antibodies could decrease the WNV load in vivo. WT and Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with WNV at the indicated time points, and the spleens and brains were harvested for titers. As expected, antibody treatment decreased the virus load in both the WT and Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5).",

The results of this study show that F(ab\u2032)2 fragments are not as efficient as IgG, both in vitro and in vivo, and a possible factor contributing to this outcome is that F(ab\u2032)2 has a shorter half-life than IgG.",
