            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows, and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs, and continues to be the most economically significant disease in the swine industry [1,2]. The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus containing a genome of approximately 15 kb [3]. The 5\u2019 two-thirds of the viral genome is occupied by overlapping open reading frames 1a (ORF1a) and 1b, which encode nonstructural polyproteins (Nsp), pp1a and pp1ab, respectively [4,5]. These polyproteins are proteolytically processed into 14 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, and Nsp2 to 12) [6-8]. In 2006, an atypical PRRS outbreak in China was caused by an emerging highly-pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain with a discontinuous deletion of 30-amino acid in the Nsp2 coding region in comparison with classical PRRSV strains [9,10]. Since then, the HP-PRRSV strain, which caused a more severe pneumonia and higher mortality than the classical PRRSV, has become the dominant strain found in China [11,12]. The immense genetic variability in the coding region of Nsp2 suggests that Nsp2 may play a limited role in viral replication but likely to play a very important part in modulating virus pathogenesis and the inflammation response in pigs during infection [13-16].",

            "text": "NF-\u03baB is a family of inducible transcription factors involving pathogen- or cytokine-induced immune and inflammatory responses, as well as cell proliferation and survival [17-20]. The members of the NF-\u03baB family in mammalian cells include p50/p105 (NF\u03baB1), p65 (RelA), p52/p100 (NF\u03baB2), c-Rel, and RelB. All of these proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region known as the Rel homology domain that is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. In most cells, Rel family members form hetero- and homodimers with distinct specificities in various combinations [21,22]. Classical NF-\u03baB exists as heterodimers consisting of a 50-kDa subunit (p50) and a 65-kDa subunit (p65) [23]. Under normal physiological conditions, NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes by its interaction with a member of the inhibitory kappa B (I\u03baB) family. When stimulated with a wide range of proinflammatory stimuli, the I\u03baB proteins are phosphorylated by I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and degraded in proteasomes [24]. The subunit of NF-\u03baB p65 is then phosphorylated while exposing its nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS), leading to nuclear translocation and subsequent binding of NF-\u03baB to DNA regulatory elements of the target genes involved in various biological functions [6,21-23,25].",

For example, UL37 tegument protein, encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) interacts with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), resulting in the NF-\u03baB activation [27]. Similarly, NF-\u03baB activation induced by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein and Epstein\u2013Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is important for infected cell survival and persistent viral infection [28,29]. Previous studies of PRRSV have demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein was a NF-\u03baB activator [30-32]; however, it remains unclear whether the PRRSV Nsps contribute to NF-\u03baB activation. The current study demonstrated that PRRSV Nsp2 alone could activate the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway and the potential molecular mechanism(s) for NF-\u03baB activation were also investigated.",

As shown in Figure 1A, overexpression of Nsp2 in HeLa cells potently induced NF-\u03baB activation, while this activation was not observed in cells overexpressing other viral nonstructural proteins. To further confirm the effect of Nsp2 on NF-\u03baB, HeLa cells were transfected with increasing amounts of Nsp2 expression plasmid and NF-\u03baB luciferase activity was monitored at 36 h post-transfection. As shown in Figure 1B, a dose-dependent increase in luciferase reporter activity was observed. These data clearly indicated that Nsp2 was responsible for the induction of NF-\u03baB activation among PRRSV nonstructural proteins. Similar results were obtained using MARC-145 cells overexpressing Nsp2 (data not shown).",

To investigate the potential mechanism(s) of NF-\u03baB activation by Nsp2, we first examined the I\u03baB\u03b1 expression level in the cytoplasmic extracts using a western blot assay. As shown in Figure 2A, the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein degraded in a dose-dependent manner in Nsp2-transfected cells. To further characterize the mechanism, the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit, as well as the total p65 in Nsp2 expression cells were determined. As shown in Figure 2A, the amount of phosphorylated p65 and nuclear p65 protein increased in a dose-dependent manner, while the amount of total p65 was unaltered. To further validate NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation after Nsp2 overexpression, HeLa cells co-transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-p65 and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-Nsp2 fusion expression constructs were used to monitor the translocation of p65 by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 2B, the p65 protein accumulated in the nucleus when co-expressed with Nsp2, while it was retained in the cytoplasm when co-expressed with the empty vector or expressed alone.",

Previous studies have shown that PRRSV infection can induce several cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, RANTES, and TNF-\u03b1, in porcine macrophages involved in the pulmonary inflammatory response [34,35]. To further investigate the possible biological impact of Nsp2 on pro-inflammatory molecules, a promoter luciferase reporter assay was used to determine if Nsp2 enhanced NF-\u03baB-regulated target gene expression, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. As shown in Figure 3A, overexpression of Nsp2 enhanced the promoter activities of IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES to varying degrees. To further confirm these results, the mRNA expression of these cytokines was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As shown in Figure 3B, gene expression data were consistent with the promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay. Interestingly, as a result of treatment with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, BAY-117082, Nsp2 exhibited reduced ability to upregulate IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES expression in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).

Using a series of chimeric viruses where the deletion region was substituted with corresponding regions of low virulence strains, Zhou et al. elucidated that the 30-aa deletion was not the primary determinant of virulence of HP-PRRSV. These findings are consistent with those in the current study that found there was no direct association between NF-\u03baB activation and the 30-aa deletion in Nsp2. In addition, our investigation showed that Nsp2 specifically localized to the mitochondria (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that the mitochondria played an important role in the activation of NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signalling (MAVS) in response to viral infection [38]. Whether the localization of Nsp2 in the mitochondria is essential for its capacity for NF-\u03baB activation requires further investigation.",

This suggested that PRRSV Nsp2 is a multi-functional replicase subunit with different domains involved in different functions in viral replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the activation of NF-\u03baB has been previously described in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages [31,32]. However, recent studies have reported that several PRRSV Nsps, including Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, Nsp11, could function as negative regulators of NF-\u03baB to escape the host innate immune response [14,40]. Furthermore, studies from our laboratory showed that the N protein of PRRSV could induce NF-\u03baB activation [41]. Taken together, these studies suggest that PRRSV might have developed sophisticated strategies for either activation or inhibition of NF-\u03baB pathway to survive in host cells.
