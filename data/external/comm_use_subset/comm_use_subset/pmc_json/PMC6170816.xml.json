            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a non-enveloped virus with positive-sense and single-stranded RNA genome. The viral genome is approximately 8.5 kb nucleotides in length, including a single large open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein. The polyprotein is subsequently processed by viral proteases during protein synthesis, generating several intermediates and 12 mature proteins (Sobrino and Domingo, 2001; Grubman and Baxt, 2004). During co-evolution with the hosts, these viral proteins have acquired many functions to counteract host antiviral responses, cause immunosuppression, and promote viral replication and infection (Mason et al., 2003; Rodriguez Pulido and Saiz, 2017). Therefore, FMDV causes an acute vesicular disease of infected animals, which is called foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). FMD is a highly contagious disease that can lead to significant economic losses to the local livestock industry (Rweyemamu et al., 2008a; Paton and Taylor, 2011; Zai-Xin, 2015; Bouguedour and Ripani, 2016). The understanding of host-FMDV interaction as well as the involved mechanism contributes to the planning of new strategies for FMD prevention (Domingo et al., 2005; Rweyemamu et al., 2008b; Rodriguez Pulido and Saiz, 2017). Accordingly, many researches on host responses in FMDV-infected cells have to be investigated.",

EGR1 is involved in diverse biologic functions and a broad variety of host signal transduction cascades that mediates cell growth, survival, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation (Pagel and Deindl, 2011; Papanikolaou et al., 2014). Different pathways have been identified that participate in EGR1 induction and then regulates several biological behaviors. Such as, the Ras homologue gene family (Rho) genes are involved in cell cycle progression, and the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway has been shown to regulate EGR1 expression (Barrientos et al., 2007; Pagel and Deindl, 2011). As a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein, EGR1 also regulates expression of diverse gene families by binding to promoter sequences of target genes (Papanikolaou et al., 2014). Therefore, EGR1 is involved in activation of signal transduction of many pathways.",

EGR1 modulates pro-apoptotic pathway and promotes Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication (Baer et al., 2016). Knockdown of EGR1 in Rhabdomyosarcoma cells decreases enterovirus 71 (EV71) replication (Song et al., 2015). It seems that EGR1 might play a positive role in these viruses replication. However, EGR1 also appears critical for the initiation of immune response in B cells and T cells. EGR1 plays roles in regulation of the expression of sever cytokines including interleukin-2, CD44, ICAM-1 and tumor necrosis factor genes (Skerka et al., 1995; McMahon and Monroe, 1996; Shin et al., 2009; Cubero and Nieto, 2012).",

(2009). Mutation of Lpro SAP domain promotes type I IFN signaling activation and decreases virus growth. In addition, animals inoculated with the FMDV SAP mutant display strong neutralizing antibody response and T cell response comparing with infection with wildtype FMDV (de los Santos et al., 2009; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2012). In this study, a robust EGR1 upregulation was observed in both wildtype and SAP mutant FMDV-infected cells comparing with the mock-infected cells by viewing the protein abundance of EGR1. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between FMDV infection and EGR1, and determined the antiviral role of EGR1 against FMDV. SAP mutant FMDV infection induced a higher expression of EGR1 than wildtype FMDV infection. SAP mutant FMDV infection also triggered higher IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression than wildtype FMDV infection. We also found that overexpression of EGR1 enhanced Sendai virus (SeV)-induced interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE) activation. SeV-induced ISGs expression was impaired in EGR1 knockdown cells, which may serve as a link between upregulation of EGR1 and type I IFN signaling. Further study showed that EGR1 enhanced TBK1 phosphorylation during FMDV infection. It indicated that EGR1 upregulation promoted type I IFN signaling activation by enhancing TBK1 phosphorylation and resulted in decreased FMDV replication. This study reveals a link between EGR1 and innate immune response during FMDV infection.",

The expression levels of EGR1 and viral VP1 protein were detected by Western blotting. We observed that EGR1 protein level is significantly upregulated both in wildtype and SAP mutant FMDV-infected cells at 12 h postinfection (hpi) (Figure 1A). Therefore, the correlation between FMDV infection and EGR1 was further investigated. The dynamics of EGR1 in FMDV-infected cells were determined. Transcripts of EGR1 were considerably upregulated after FMDV infection and reached to the highest level at 8 hpi. No significant changes were observed in mock-infected cells (Figure 1B). EGR1 protein expression was also gradually upregulated as the infection progressed (Figure 1C). This indicates that FMDV infection triggers upregulation of EGR1. To investigate whether EGR1 is an IFN inducible gene, HEK293T and PK-15 cells were incubated with IFN-\u03b2 to induce the expression of IFN inducible genes. The expression of two IFN inducible genes ISG15 and ISG54 was highly induced by incubation of IFN-\u03b2. However, the expression of EGR1 was not changed by treatment of IFN-\u03b2 (Figure 1D). This indicated that EGR1 expression was not induced by IFN-\u03b2 treatment; however, FMDV infection could induce EGR1 expression.",

PK-15 cells were transfected with different doses of EGR1 expressing plasmids, the cells were incubated with equal amounts of FMDV (0.5 MOI) at 24 h post-transfection (hpt). The viral protein and viral RNA expression level was measured at 12 hpi. Overexpression of EGR1 significantly suppressed both the viral protein expression and viral RNA replication. The viral titers in both vector and EGR1 plasmids (2 \u03bcg) transfected cells were measured and compared, which showed that FMDV yields were also decreased by overexpression of EGR1 (Figure 2A). To further confirm the antiviral role of EGR1 during FMDV infection, the siRNAs that target EGR1 were designed and evaluated. PK-15 cells were transfected with the NC siRNA or EGR1 siRNA for 48 h, the interference efficacy of the siRNAs was determined by qPCR analysis. The EGR1 siRNA-1819 showed the highest efficacy and was used for EGR1 knockdown assay (Figure 2B). PK-15 cells were transfected with EGR1 siRNA-1819, the cells were infected with FMDV at 48 hpt and incubated for another 12 or 16 h. The expression of EGR1 and FMDV VP1 protein was detected using Western blotting. Knockdown of EGR1 considerably increased VP1 protein expression during FMDV infection (Figure 2C). The relative fold-change in abundance of FMDV VP1 protein in FMDV-infected NC siRNA or EGR1 siRNA cells was determined by densitometric analysis and normalized to \u03b2-actin, which confirmed that knockdown of EGR1 enhanced FMDV VP1 protein expression (Figure 2C, right panel). Viral RNA detection also suggested that knockdown of EGR1 promoted viral replication (Figure 2D). The viral titers were subsequently measured at 16 hpi, which showed that knockdown of EGR1 significantly promoted FMDV propagation (Figure 2D, right panel). These results suggest the antiviral role of EGR1 against FMDV.",

Overexpression of EGR1 significantly promoted SeV-induced type I IFN signaling, showing a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B). The expression of IFN-\u03b2, ISG15 and MX1 in EGR1 overexpressed cells were subsequently evaluated. The results showed that overexpression of EGR1 considerably promoted SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2, ISG15 and MX1 expression (Figure 3C). The effect of EGR1 on SeV-induced NF-\u03baB activation was also evaluated by dual luciferase reporter assay, which also showed that EGR1 positively enhanced NF-\u03baB-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 3D). The role of EGR1 on Poly (I:C)-induced type I IFN signaling was further evaluated. Overexpression of EGR1 significantly promoted Poly (I:C)-induced type I IFN signaling (Figure 3E). The expression of Poly (I:C)-induced ISGs was also measured. The results showed that overexpression of EGR1 considerably promoted Poly (I:C)-induced ISG15 and ISG54 expression (Figure 3F). SeV-induced ISGs expression levels in EGR1 knockdown cells were also analyzed. The siRNA interference efficacy was also verified in HEK293T cells (Figure 3G). EGR1 was knocked down by transfection of siRNA, and the cells were infected by SeV at 48 hpt and incubated for 16 h. The expression of IFN-\u03b2, ISG15 and MX1 were measured. The transcript levels of IFN-\u03b2, ISG15 and MX1 remarkably decreased in EGR1 knockdown cells comparing with that in NC siRNA cell (Figure 3H). These results suggested a positive regulatory role of EGR1 on type I IFN signaling.",

Overexpression of adaptor proteins RIG-I, RIG-I(CARD), MDA5), VISA, TBK1, IRF3 or IRF7 all activated the ISRE luciferase reporter system, and overexpression of MDA5(Helicase) did not activate the ISRE luciferase reporter system (Figure 4). TBK1 or its upstream proteins (RIG-I, MDA5 and VISA) mediated type I IFN signaling was significantly enhanced by overexpression of EGR1. However, overexpression of EGR1 did not promote IRF3 and IRF7 mediated type I IFN signaling (Figure 4). IRF3 and IRF7 are the downstream proteins of TBK1.

EGR1 enhanced the activation of ISRE luciferase reporter stimulated by TBK1 and its upstream molecules. TBK1 might be a key adaptor to enhance type I IFN signaling. The influence of EGR1 on TBK1 expression and TBK1 phosphorylation levels were evaluated in FMDV-infected cells. PK-15 cells were transfected with 2 \u03bcg of Myc-EGR1 or its empty vector plasmids. The cells were infected with equal amounts of FMDV at 24 hpt and collected at 0, 6, 12, or 18 hpi. Overexpression of EGR1 had no influence on TBK1 expression during FMDV infection. However, it significantly promoted TBK1 phosphorylation levels after FMDV infection comparing with that in the empty vector transfected cells (Figure 5B). The VP1 was used as an indicator of viral replication. Overexpression of EGR1 also resulted in decreased VP1 abundance (Figure 5B).

However, EGR1 expression is related to viral pathogenesis during VEEV, MHV and EV71 replication. All these studies were performed using mouse or human cells, and most of these viruses can cause central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this study we investigated the function of porcine EGR1 and showed the antiviral role of porcine EGR1 against FMDV. FMDV infection does not cause any CNS disease. Whether the difference of species or tissue tropism resulted in the different role of EGR1 in different virus infections remain unknown. However, EGR1 has been suggested to participate in IFN-\u03b3-STAT1 pathway in T cells (Shin et al., 2009). T-bet is a Th1-specific transcription factor that is directly involved in T cells differentiation (Djuretic et al., 2007). EGR1 regulates T-bet expression by binding to the promoter of T-bet and induces T-bet transcription (Shin et al., 2009). T-bet plays a vital role in innate immunity, and lacking of T-bet expression increases host susceptibility to inflammatory disease (Garrett et al., 2007). This implies a regulatory role of EGR1 in innate immunity. Besides, overexpression of EGR1 downregulates NF\u03baB inhibitor (Kim et al., 2013), which also implies a potential role of EGR1 in innate immunity.",

A higher EGR1 expression was observed in SAP mutant FMDV-infected cells comparing with that in the wildtype FMDV-infected cells. It has been determined that SAP mutant FMDV infection resulted in stronger type I IFN signaling than wildtype FMDV infection (de los Santos et al., 2009). We found that SAP mutant FMDV infection triggered higher expression of IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs than wildtype FMDV infection. This result was similar as the result reported by de los Santos et al. (2009) previously. Whether the higher expression of EGR1 correlated with the higher expression of IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs was therefore investigated. Overexpression of EGR1 significantly activated type I IFN signaling and IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs expression. Knockdown of EGR1 considerably impaired SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs expression. Type I IFN blocking antibodies obviously abrogated the inhibitory effects of EGR1 on FMDV propagation. This suggested EGR1 is implicated in type I IFN pathway activation. A link between EGR1 and type I IFN pathway was reported for the first time.",

Overexpression of EGR1 upregulated TBK1 phosphorylation during FMDV infection. TBK1 phosphorylation enhanced type I IFN signaling and strengthened antiviral activity which subsequently suppressed FMDV replication. EGR1 is a transcription factor; however, it does not induce TBK1 expression. The interaction between EGR1 and various adaptors of type I IFN signaling pathway was not observed by performing coimmunoprecipitation assay. The role of the transcriptional activity of EGR1 for its antiviral function against FMDV was also evaluated. Suppression of the transcriptional activity of EGR1 did not affect its antiviral effect. EGR1 might enhance type I IFN signaling independent of its transcriptional activity. How does EGR1 promote TBK1 phosphorylation is not clear. Several phosphatases have been identified as regulator of phosphorylation of TBK1 (Gabhann et al., 2010; Zhao, 2013). The regulation of EGR1 on these phosphatases should be studied in future, and the detailed mechanism of EGR1 to promote TBK1 phosphorylation should be further investigated. In addition, the effect of EGR1 on the adaption of other upstream molecules of TBK1 should also be exploited.",
