Extracts and constituents of Andrographis paniculate exhibit broad pharmacological activities, such as anti-bacterial, ant-malarial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, immunological regulation, and hepatoprotective effects [3\u201312]. Lately, some andrographolide derivatives were reported to decrease blood glucose level by inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase [13,14]. It has been well known that \u03b1-glucosidase is a key enzyme in the absorption of sugar in the small intestine mucous membrane, and its activity is closely related to blood glucose levels. Studies also indicated that \u03b1-glucosidase might be involved in diabetes [15\u201320]. Accordingly, \u03b1-glucosidase is considered an important target for the design of antidiabetic drugs. Recently, efforts had been made in modification and synthesis of novel andrographolide derivatives to find more potent and safer \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors. Knowledge about the relationships between structures of andrographolide derivatives and their inhibitory activities on \u03b1-glucosidase could greatly facilitate the drug discovery process.",

Statistical methods are applied in QSAR modeling to establish correlations between chemical structures and their biological activities. Once validated, the findings can be used to predict activities of untested compounds. Recently, computer-assisted drug design based on QSAR has been successfully employed to develop new drugs for the treatment of cancer, AIDS, SARS, and other diseases [22\u201329]. With the availability of large commercial databases and highly efficient programs including Sybyl, Discovery studio, MOE and so on, it is estimated that QSAR modeling as a tool could remarkably reduces the cost of drug discovery [30].",

Cross-validation is used to estimate the QSAR model\u2019s predictability. In general, a LOO cross-validated coefficient Q2 (higher than 0.5) can be considered as statistically high predictive ability [36]. CoMFA, which is widely utilized in 3D-QSAR research, claims that if a group of similar compounds are ligands of the same receptor, their bioactivities depend on the differences of the molecules\u2019 fields surrounding them [37]. CoMFA can exhibit a contour map in a 3D graph, which makes it easier to distinguish differences between compounds with strong and weak activities. CoMSIA is another 3D-QSAR method that adopts a Gaussian function instead of traditional Coulomb and Lennard-Jones\u2019 function used in CoMFA [38]. Therefore, CoMSIA efficiently avoids the shortcomings of CoMFA in which only the steric and electrostatic fields are used. The leave-one-out (LOO) method is employed to validate the predictability of the models and Y-Randomization test is used to validate the robustness of the models [39].",

Since the QSAR model was employed to predict unknown compounds\u2019 activity, the model\u2019s predictability was the criterion to judge which QSAR model was the best. Predictability of a QSAR model was not only expressed by cross-validation (q2) but also by validation of the test set. The results illustrated that four models (4, 8, 10 and 11) had the top four predictabilities, so the Focus method was then applied to optimize these models, and further improved predictability for model 4, 10 and 11, but not for model 8. Among these models (model 8, 13, 15 and 16), model 16 exhibited the best predictability as indicated by the highest Q2 value. Predictability of these models (8, 13, 15 and 16) was further evaluated using a test set. Model 16 also provided the best prediction with a correlation coefficient R2 (0.941) (Table 3). Overall, this model represented the best QSAR model (q2 = 0.794, R2cv = 0.915, SEcv = 0.127, R2test set = 0.941, SEtest set = 0.104).

Furthermore, the 3D QSAR model was based on molecular properties belonging to steric, hydrophobic and H-acceptor fields and indicated that compounds with structures fitting better into the 3D contour maps of model 16 had more potent activities. Combining 2D and 3D QSAR models, the key fragments and their spatial distribution could be efficiently identified. The convinced predictability of the model was demonstrated not only by internal validation but also by external validation using a test set. Overall, these results suggested that the developed QSAR model could be used to predict the inhibitory activities of unknown andrographolide derivatives on \u03b1-glucosidase.
