The basic reproduction number (R\n0), defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical infectious individual in a whole susceptible population, is a common measure of disease transmissibility. Valid and reliable estimate of the R\n0 can assist officials in planning control and prevention measures for an influenza pandemic. On the contrary, underestimation of the disease transmissibility will induce an insufficient public awareness on the risk of infection and therefore lower the general public\u2019s incentive to protect themselves against infectious diseases through vaccines, hand washing or other protective measures.",

Common surveillance data can be fitted into an exponential growth model or Kermack-McKendrick-type models to estimate R\n0 [1, 2]. Likelihood-based methods are an alternative [3, 4]. Chowell et al. [5] showed that these types of methods are not sensitive on R\n0 estimation given an acceptable goodness of fit. Nevertheless, one of the caveats of using ILI surveillance data is the underreporting although several approaches were developed to adjust this problem [6].",

During the initial outbreak of a new influenza pandemic, control measures will be initiated at the border points of entry by various concerned countries. On preventing infected persons from seeding local epidemics, local governments may identify the symptomatic passengers by implementing thermal screening, monitor the suspected cases having a travel history to the originating country and even take quarantine measures [11]. Some travel information such as arrival times of infected cases seeded by the originating country is a combination of the epidemic size and the transport network between the originating country and other at-risk countries. By adapting this information, the transmissibility of an originating country during the initial phase of a pandemic can be back-calculated in order to reduce errors from the underestimation of routine surveillance data [9, 12, 13]. The data about importation events is usually timelier than other available data sources such as seroprevalence data. In the H1N1 pandemic, empirical evidence showed that the flow of airline passenger from Mexico had a significant correlation to the detection of exported cases [14]. Because of intense screening for ILI travelers returning from Mexico, ascertainment of early cases in at-risk countries was timelier and complete compared with routine surveillance in Mexico. Hence, it is believed that the data type is able to provide a reliable estimate on disease transmissibility.",

Subsequent to a report revealing that two cases of an acute respiratory illness were discovered in two children living in the Southern California of the United States and further confirmed as infections of a new strain of H1N1 virus, additional cases were soon discovered in the country. By the end of April, WHO had further raised the pH1N1 alert to Phase Five, although both the general public and the governments still lacked adequate knowledge on the early stages of pH1N1 at that time.

The arrival time and illness onset time of infected cases seeded by Mexico, and the number of passengers were retrieved from the studies of Fraser et al. [9], Balcan et al. [12], other articles [22\u201324] and some news from press [25, 26] with evidence that cases were imported from Mexico.

The results showed that with a low transmissibility, small samples could still achieve a stable precision level, for example, the 95% CrIs were around 1.19 to 1.22 when n \u2265 8 in the setting of R\n0 = 1.2. Higher values of R\n0 were associated with a slightly lower precision of the estimates. The estimation performance did not show any obvious difference between travel volumes. Apart from that, the estimates from our proposed method were robust to plausible drops of travel rates (Table 3). It was because most cases probably arose in the early phase of pandemic in which changes of travel may not subject to any impact in such a short period of time. The robustness of parameter assumptions was also assessed (Fig. 1). As with other studies, R\n0 estimation was moderately sensitive to the infectious duration (or the generation interval). Given a plausible distributional assumption, the bias increased and the precision levels decreased with the increase of R\n0. For example, the estimate was around 2.4 and the 95% CrI ranged from 1.7 to 3.7 for an expected R\n0 of 2.2. Nevertheless, the estimation performance was not sensitive in the scenarios with lower values of R\n0. Besides, the simulation results were robust to the assumptions of average stay duration and the proportion of asymptomatic infections. Like most simulation scenarios, the performances were better for a low transmissibility setting.\n\n\n",

Arrival times of cases seeded by the originating country can be regarded as an integration of the number of infected individuals in the originating country and their mobility networks connecting with other regions [28, 29]. By adapting such travel data as a proxy of the size of epidemic expansion, the transmissibility of the influenza virus can be estimated. The estimation based on this information can prevent the bias induced by underestimations of different surveillance data. Undoubtedly, numbers of cases reported by surveillance systems are usually underestimated due to sampling methods, under-detection, and changes of capacities and requirements over time [9, 13, 30]. Apart from that, routine seroprevalence studies that require laboratory resources and a considerably long sample collection time may no longer serve as a suitable monitoring approach during the initial outbreak of a pandemic [31]. In consideration that serological data can refine parameter estimates, a reliable way of using serial cross-sectional serological data alongside with surveillance data to estimate infection rate can be adopted [8]. To address possible errors in the estimation, multi-faceted surveillance measures shall be adopted, especially during the early stages of new influenza outbreaks.",

Compared with other similar studies, Fraser et al. developed a Bayesian method to draw a posterior distribution of R\n0 for the pH1N1 in Mexico by assuming that tourists infected at a rate proportional to the density of tourists per local resident [12]. The approach adopted the number of infected travelers within a fixed period rather than using the times of exporting infections to countries. Although their estimate (posterior median R\n0 = 1.4) was similar to us, time to event data combining the mobility and pattern of epidemic invasion is usually preferred to the count data. Balcan et al. used a MLE approach to fit the arrival time data to the simulated epidemics through a highly parameterized meta-population model in which the R\n0 was their parameter of interest [12]. Their estimate (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\widehat{R}}_0=1.75 $$\\end{document}R^0=1.75) was also closer to our finding. Although their transmission model required many details for parameterization and was computational intensive, it provides an estimate closer to the biological realism over a large population.

Moreover, no adjustment for disease transmissions on aircrafts was incorporated in the estimation. Nevertheless, a retrospective cohort study indicated in-flight transmissions were unlikely [33]. As with many other approaches, we assumed homogeneous mixings at a country level and same risks of infections between travelers and the domestic population. In the early stage of a pandemic, stochastic effects usually induce spatial variations [9]. Apart from that, since airports are the main hubs of connection between countries, passengers will be more likely to be infected in the areas near the airport than areas far from the airports especially for an infectious disease with a short generation interval. Some cases would even recover before their travels. Further developments can take these issues into a consideration.",
