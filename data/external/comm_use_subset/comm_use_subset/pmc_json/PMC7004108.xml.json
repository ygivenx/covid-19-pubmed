            "text": "Viruses occur across all environments that support life, where they play crucial roles in ecosystem function and in the health of their hosts (Manrique et al., 2016; Suttle, 2005). Additionally, viruses have played foundational evolutionary roles by introducing novel diversity into host genomes (Feschotte & Gilbert, 2012) which has, for instance, contributed to the development of mammalian placentas (Chuong, 2013; Mi et al., 2000) and enhanced antiviral defence through host domestication of viral proteins (Arnaud et al., 2007; Yan, Buckler\u2010White, Wollenberg, & Kozak, 2009). Our understanding of the factors that influence viral diversity in nature currently derives primarily from comparisons of viral communities between different host species. These studies have revealed that viral communities are shaped by host traits, including body mass and geographical range overlap with other species (Luis et al., 2013; Olival et al., 2017; Turmelle & Olival, 2009). At the population level, however (i.e., among populations of the same host species), the degree to which viral communities are structured by variation in demography and environmental heterogeneity, stochastic forces or host evolutionary history remains unclear.",

            "text": "Understanding whether spatial and ecological variation among populations can explain viral diversity is an important first step if we ultimately aim to forecast changes in viral communities in response to environmental changes or disease control interventions (Anthony et al., 2015; Johnson, Roode, & Fenton, 2015). Such community\u2010level changes may be important due to direct, immunological or ecological interactions between viruses (DaPalma, Doonan, Trager, & Kasman, 2010; D\u00edaz\u2010Mu\u00f1oz, 2017; Rohani, Green, Mantilla\u2010Beniers, & Grenfell, 2003). Under a null model, geographically proximate populations would be expected to have more similar viral communities than distant populations. Alternatively, viral communities could be structured by demographic or environmental factors that are largely independent of distance; these include established determinants of single viral species such as host population size, age structure and cross\u2010species transmission (Keeling & Rohani, 2008). Large\u2010scale biogeographical factors such as latitudinal gradients influence the diversity of human pathogens (Guernier, Hochberg, & Gu\u00e9gan, 2004), and analogous factors such as elevational gradients may create nonlinear relationships between viral communities and distance over smaller spatial scales, but these relationships have never been tested. Finally, viral communities may be so strongly influenced by stochastic factors that prediction is intractable in most natural systems using either spatial proximity or ecological variables that can be realistically measured in the field.",

A key barrier has been our inability to characterize unbiased viral communities. The predominance of single pathogen diagnostics, financial constraints and a priori uncertainty of which pathogens are likely to be detected have created ascertainment biases toward certain viral groups (Young & Olival, 2016). Metagenomic sequencing is an alternative data source that enables the simultaneous characterization of entire viral communities (Edwards & Rohwer, 2005) but is rarely applied across multiple populations of the same host species. Applying metagenomic sequencing to spatially replicated data sets therefore offers a new opportunity to understand how host ecology and biogeography influence viral diversity, particularly if applied to host species that occur across habitat types or environmental gradients.",

            "text": "The common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a widespread species that inhabits tropical rainforests, high\u2010elevation mountains and coastal deserts across North, Central and South America and thrives in both native and anthropogenically transformed ecosystems (Martins, Templeton, Pavan, Kohlbach, & Morgante, 2009; Quintana & Pacheco, 2007). This habitat generalism means that vampire bats live in colonies with extensive variation in climate, anthropogenic food resources and presence of other bat species. Colonies also vary in demographic traits that might impact viral community structure, such as population size, age structure and sex ratio (Delpietro, Marchevsky, & Simonetti, 1992; Delpietro, Russo, Carter, Lord, & Delpietro, 2017; Greenhall, Joermann, Schmidt, & Seidel, 1983; Streicker et al., 2012) (Table 1). As with most broadly distributed species, populations vary in their relative geographical proximity and genetic relatedness (Martins et al., 2009; Streicker et al., 2016), providing an opportunity to test the null expectation that viral community similarity declines with increasing geographical and genetic distance between populations (Nekola & White, 1999). Finally, viral diversity of vampire bats is a major concern for human and animal health, as these bats routinely feed on the blood of livestock and to a lesser degree humans, and are the primary reservoir of rabies virus in the region (Greenhall et al., 1983; Johnson, Ar\u00e9chiga\u2010Ceballos, & Aguilar\u2010Setien, 2014; Voigt & Kelm, 2006). The burden of vampire bat rabies is significant, with an estimated cost of US$50 million per year in livestock losses (Belotto, Leanes, Schneider, Tamayo, & Correa, 2005) and with an estimated force of infection of up to 960 rabies cases per 100,000 inhabitants in a hypothetical outbreak (Schneider et al., 1996). Demographic and ecological factors driving viral dispersal in vampire bats have been investigated specifically for rabies virus (Streicker et al., 2016; de Thoisy et al., 2016; Torres et al., 2014) but such questions have not yet been examined at the level of viral communities.",

The extent and determinants of variation in viral communities among populations of the same species have remained largely unexplored but have implications for understanding how viral communities will respond to environmental change or human disturbance. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing of viruses in vampire bat populations across Peru, our study showed extensive variation in viral communities across populations of the same species and rejected a null model of viral similarity being purely driven by spatial proximity of host populations. Instead, an elevational gradient, host age structure and anthropogenic food resources, but not bat colony size, influenced the richness of viral communities in faecal samples.

Indeed, saliva viruses were largely unique to each bat colony, while faecal viral communities were more conserved within ecoregions, with greater similarity among increasingly genetically and geographically proximal bat colonies (Figures S5 and S6). This difference between sample types suggests the possibility that routes of transmission specific to saliva (e.g., biting, licking, grooming) may restrict the extent to which viruses spread across the landscape relative to transmission routes involving faeces (e.g., environmental, faecal\u2013oral). The only factor correlated with saliva virus diversity was longitude (Figure 3; Figure S7; Table S13). In Peru, increasing longitude corresponds to a northwest\u2013southeast gradient, such that sites in the northwest (Cajamarca and Amazonas Departments) had the highest saliva viral diversity. While these sites do not correspond to a single ecoregion, our previous work has highlighted northwest Peru as a corridor for gene flow of vampire bats and rabies virus between the Coast and Andes/Amazon (Streicker et al., 2016) and as a hotspot of mitochondrial haplotype richness (Bohmann et al., 2018). We therefore hypothesize that unusually high mixing of bats from different ecoregions creates a melting pot for saliva viruses. Importantly, northwest Peru is also a hotspot of vampire bat depredation on humans, making regular human exposures to the high diversity of vampire bat salivary viruses encountered here virtually guaranteed (Gilbert et al., 2012; Stoner\u2010Duncan, Streicker, & Tedeschi, 2014). It is unclear whether the lack of bat\u2010borne zoonoses reported from this area (apart from rabies virus) reflects the host specificity of most bat viruses, an absence of reporting or insufficient diagnostics for novel human viruses.",

Similar elevational gradients have sometimes been observed in bacterial and macrofaunal communities (Fierer et al., 2011; Lomolino, 2001; Wang et al., 2011), but to our knowledge have not been described for viruses. Although the total viral community probably reflects environmental viral taxa as well as those infecting bats, increased viral diversity in the Amazon was also observed in vertebrate\u2010infecting viruses (Figure S8), suggesting this effect is not only driven by environmental viral diversity. An elevation effect in vampire bats could be explained by the declining diversity of prey, alternative host species or vectors at high elevations, or by factors correlated with elevation that influence the survival of environmentally transmitted viruses. In humans, local climate variables such as temperature and precipitation range, which are correlated with elevation, have been associated with reduced viral richness on a global scale (Guernier et al., 2004). However, that elevation itself was more strongly correlated with vertebrate\u2010infecting viral richness than environmental variables suggests that other factors that covary with elevation (i.e., community composition of bat species, prey or both) may be more important for viruses actively infecting bats. Indeed, cross\u2010species transmission is thought to be an important driver of bat viral diversity (Luis et al., 2013, 2015), and bat species richness declines with elevation (Patterson, Pacheco, & Solari, 1996). While our study did not find effects of other bat species on viral richness, it was only possible to measure the presence or absence of other bat species within the same roosts, rather than bat diversity, which might have a stronger effect. Our results also imply that, given expected range shifts towards higher elevations under climate change, we might anticipate novel interactions between hosts, vectors and environmental conditions that could eventually increase diversity in high\u2010elevation viral communities (Harvell, Altizer, Cattadori, Harrington, & Weil, 2009; Zamora\u2010Vilchis, Williams, & Johnson, 2012).",

The importance of juveniles in viral dynamics is well established; births introduce immunologically na\u00efve individuals that facilitate pathogen transmission (Amman et al., 2012; Dietrich et al., 2015; van Dijk et al., 2013; Hayman, 2015). While higher infection rates in juveniles are widely observed at the level of individual pathogens (Anthony et al., 2017; Streicker et al., 2012; Volokhov et al., 2017), to our knowledge, ours is the first report of an age effect on the richness of viral communities. This community\u2010level effect may be driven by bat demography (e.g., birth pulses or maternal stress) or differential exposure rates among age classes (Cross et al., 2009). For example, independent but subordinate juvenile bats might have elevated exposure to many viruses if they are forced to roost in suboptimal positions within caves (Amman et al., 2012). However, in vampire bats, juveniles remain dependent on their mothers until they are adults (~9\u201310 months) making this exposure effect unlikely (Greenhall et al., 1983). Consequently, we suggest that the importance of juveniles reflects many pathogens responding similarly to the influx of susceptible individuals, either through heightened transmission following a birth pulse or increased viral shedding by nursing females (Plowright et al., 2008). An effect of susceptible juveniles on viral communities is consistent with observed seasonal variation in individual vampire bat viruses (Streicker et al., 2016) due to birth pulses (Delpietro et al., 2017), and could have implications for viral spillover if shedding of many pathogens simultaneously results in more opportunities for exposure. There are also implications for the use of culling to control vampire bats and their pathogens, as culling is thought to results in a juvenile\u2010biased age structure (Streicker et al., 2012) and could therefore inadvertently increase viral community richness.",

We therefore predicted that colonies with greater access to livestock would have had higher viral diversity, potentially owing to either density\u2010dependent transmission or exposure to livestock viruses. Surprisingly, we found the opposite, that vampire bat colonies in areas of high livestock density had lower faecal viral richness (Figure 4). Moreover, colony size was unrelated to viral richness, suggesting that the transmission of many bat viruses may not be density\u2010dependent (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al., 2005). If confirmed, this finding would have important implications for managing bat pathogens through culling because artificial reduction of colony sizes would not be expected to reduce prevalence (Blackwood, Streicker, Altizer, & Rohani, 2013). One possible explanation for the observed lower viral diversity could be that the lower diversity of wildlife prey available in areas of high livestock density (Streicker & Allgeier, 2016; Voigt & Kelm, 2006) might reduce vampire bat exposure to a diverse set of viruses. Alternatively, the abundance and availability of livestock prey could enhance bat immunity leading to lower viral diversity, as hypothesized for bacterial infections (Becker et al., 2018).",

As a consequence, snapshots of viral diversity from single locations will not be representative at the host species level and may not even inform whether the virus is present in nearby populations. Adding environmental and demographic variables was able to explain significantly more variance in total saliva and faecal viral richness respectively (50% and 45%, Table S8), although some of the explanatory power for saliva samples was attributable to sequencing effort. This demonstrates that the overall ecological context governing viral exposure plays a key role in shaping viral communities in vampire bats and emphasizes the value of broad\u2010scale ecological sampling to understand viral community predictability. However, whether the presence of specific viruses can be predicted across populations remains doubtful (Anthony et al., 2015). One possibility would be to include additional variables such as seasonality because the prevalence of some bat viruses varies seasonally (Amman et al., 2012). Here, however, logistical constraints prevented us from sampling most Andean and Amazon sites during the wet season. Furthermore, although our study intended to assess population\u2010level drivers of viral communities, understanding the individual\u2010level impacts of factors including age, reproductive status or stress might provide a more complete picture of the determinants of viral diversity.",

            "text": "Although we did not test the ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation in viral diversity in this study, it is probable that some members of the vampire bat viral community identified here have functional importance. For example, viral metagenomics has identified specific viral taxa associated with disease (Duerkop et al., 2018; Hannigan, Duhaime, Ruffin, Koumpouras, & Schloss, 2018; Ly et al., 2014; Norman et al., 2015) and the critical contributions of certain viral groups to overall ecosystem function (Emerson et al., 2018; Sunagawa et al., 2015; Thurber, Payet, Thurber, & Correa, 2017). Follow\u2010up analyses could include targeting individual viral taxa that are linked with health or disease in other systems, examining associations between variation in viral diversity and host fitness, or testing interactions between viral communities and other components of the host microbiome.",

Viral communities were distinct across vampire bat populations, suggesting that analyses focusing on single individuals or single populations are unlikely to capture the full extent of species\u2010level viral diversity and that predicting changes in viral communities is likely to be challenging. Our results illustrate the power of metagenomics as a new approach for finding ecological effects on viral communities at the intraspecific level and demonstrate a combined ecological and metagenomic framework to identify these factors which could be applied in any host\u2013pathogen system.",
