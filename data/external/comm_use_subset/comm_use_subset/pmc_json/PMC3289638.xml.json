Comparison of the viral causes of infection provides a useful starting point for an understanding of illness following respiratory infection. It also provides data relevant to the development of prevention strategies. The following viruses (in no particular order) have been detected during acute respiratory infections (ARIs) [1], [2]: influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), picornavirus (PIC, including rhinovirus and enterovirus), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronavirus (HCoV). Respiratory virus infections are diagnosed in four principal ways: virus culture, serology, immunofluorescence/antigen detection, and nucleic acid/PCR-based tests. Nucleic acid tests are significantly more sensitive than the other methods described, which may have an impact on the viruses detected [1], [2]. Nucleic acid tests are now being multiplexed, allowing rapid simultaneous detection of many viruses [1], [2].",

However, more precise data regarding their epidemiology and clinical characteristics are lacking in mainland China after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no published report that describes the potential impact of viral agents on adults with ARTIs admitted to an ED in China. To directly address this situation, we screened for the presence of 13 respiratory virus in adults with ARTI admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from May, 2010, to April, 2011, in an effort to gain a better understanding of the seasonality, epidemiology, and clinical profile of these viruses in a city with a population of more than 22 million.",

Patients over 14 years of age were selected according to a set of criteria that included respiratory symptoms, a body temperature above 37.5\u00b0C, and a normal or low leukocyte count, but not pulmonary abnormalities on radiography [4]. Symptoms, history of illness, results of a clinical examination and laboratory investigations, and demographic data were recorded for each patient, using a standardized form.

This may be due to differences in detection methods, population, and/or the time the study was performed. This also reminds us that in the year after influenza pandemics, the frequency distribution of these 13 respiratory viruses in adult patients in the Beijing area may increase, pending further studies. In addition, of the 416 samples, no viruses were detected in 196 (47.11%).

Except for chills and diarrhoea (P>0.05), the clinical characteristics of ARTIs caused by these four viruses differed slightly. Headache was associated with PIC, ADV, and HCoV infection. Cough was significantly more common in influenza patients; and sore throat, cough, rhinorrhoea, nasal symptoms were more common in those infected with PIC, which were in line with previous reports [2], [6], [18]. Molecular assays are useful for diagnosis of RTIs, because it is often difficult even for the experienced clinician to pinpoint the aetiological agent based only on clinical information. Thus, etiological research may facilitate physicians' appropriate antibiotic use, and will provide useful information for surveillance and control of ARTIs [27].",

            "text": "In summary, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of 13 RVs in adults with ARTIs admitted to an ED in Beijing. Our study is original and unique in several aspects. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first use of sensitive, real-time RT-PCR assays targeting all four HCoVs and hMPV in adults with ARTIs in China. Compared to the reports of Ren et al. [4], [5] regarding adult ARTIs which specimens collected from the same hospital (Table 4), the detection rates of several aetiological agents (hMPV, total HCoVs, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-HKU1) in this study were significantly higher (P<0.05,the data were compared between groups of specimens for virus detected using a Student's t-test), although the reasons for this require further investigation. The second unique aspect of this study is the identification of four leading viral agents (PIC, FluA, ADV, and HCoVs) and associated clinical profiles in adults with ARTIs admitted to the ED. The pattern differed from those in previous reports from the same area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the potential impact of four viruses (PIC, FluA, ADV, and HCoVs) as causes of ARTIs in adults admitted to an ED in China. The main limitation of the study is that we did not evaluate other recently identified viruses (such as bocavirus, WU, and KI virus) or atypical aetiologies. An additional limitation is that the subjects were recruited only in one continuous year. It is possible that these limitations might have affected the results and should be taken into consideration.",
