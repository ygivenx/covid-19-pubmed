            "text": "Recent years have seen significant outbreaks of several emerging zoonotic diseases, ranging from the well known (e.g. Ebola), to the previously little known (Zika), to the novel (Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS). It is well established that most communicable human diseases have animal origins [1,2], and over two-thirds of emerging human pathogens originate from mammals [3,4]. In addition, endemic zoonoses continue to pose major threats to human health, well-being [5] and economic security [6]. Despite the importance of cross-species spillover transmission of zoonotic pathogens [7], there has been relatively little attention paid to how these pathogens are shared between humans and non-human animals. Indeed, in many cases, the animal sources of major human outbreaks have only been identified after the outbreaks have occurred. There is a pressing need to increase our understanding of how pathogens are shared between humans and animals, so that we can anticipate possible outbreaks in advance [8,9].",

Can we identify important host species and quantify their roles in sharing and transmitting different pathogen taxa? Can these roles be integrated with mammalian traits to predict reservoirs of zoonoses? And which host traits and roles best explain the number of pathogens shared between mammalian hosts and humans?",

We also calculated network-level E\u2013I index based on species orders. Given a categorical node attribute describing mutually exclusive groups (in our case, order), the E\u2013I index represents a ratio of external (with other orders) to internal (within order) edges. A positive network-level E\u2013I index indicates a tendency of hosts to share pathogens with species outside their order (i.e. extrovert), whereas a negative E\u2013I index indicates a tendency to share pathogens within orders (i.e. introvert).\n",

However, due to the large number of available metrics in each category, determining which ones are best suited for identifying important hosts in networks is not straightforward.

Let us assume, for instance, that we have three mammalian species: A, B and C, and that A and B share 10 protozoan agents, whereas B and C share 5 protozoan agents. Here, we have two extreme scenarios, as follows. (i) The protozoans are all different; A and C do not share any protozoan pathogens, which in turn means that there is no flow of protozoan pathogens from A to C despite a path existing between the two (via B). (ii) The five protozoans shared by B and C are among the 10 shared by A and B and, therefore, half of A's protozoans are shared with C, and all of C's are shared with A. Both scenarios have implications on the traditional centralities analysed in the previous subsection. To address these issues, we developed a novel entropy-based metric, which we term indirect influence (II). II captures the influence each host species exercises within the unipartite network by measuring the number and frequency of pathogens this host spreads indirectly through its neighbouring species if it were to interact with each of them in isolation to the remainder of the network. Entropy enables us to capture uncertainties in the destination of pathogens as a function of the original host [33] at three levels: (i) a species which shares a few pathogens with many neighbours: entropy captures uncertainty in which neighbour it could influence indirectly; (ii) a species which shares many pathogens with few neighbours: entropy allows us to capture uncertainty in pathogens shared; and (iii) a species which shares many pathogens with many neighbours will have high centrality due to uncertainties in both pathogens shared and neighbours influenced. In addition, using entropy allows us to avoid assessing the many paths connecting all node pairs and instead, focus on the potential of the node (i.e. the host species) to diversify pathogen propagation [33,34].",

This measure provided key insight into the probability of mammalian hosts sharing pathogens with humans (question 2). It suggested that, regardless of pathogen type, mammal species that can spread more of their pathogens indirectly through their neighbours are more likely to harbour zoonoses than other species. (ii) Our ensembles provided a flexible, robust, unbiased mechanism to address our questions. (iii) By investigating sharing of pathogens across multiple taxa and sub-taxa (e.g. DNA/RNA viruses, Gram+/Gram\u2212 bacteria), we were able to ascertain important differences in the mechanisms of sharing of different types of pathogens, and the effect this has on zoonoses. (iv) In addition, by integrating three measures of centrality, rather than focusing on a single measure, we were able to differentiate key species in networks based on the unique characteristics of each network. This was highlighted where host species with higher betweenness carried more zoonotic viruses and bacteria, whereas hosts with higher Opsahl degree carried more zoonotic helminths and protozoa. (v) Finally, we were also able to differentiate the roles that host order and their domestication status play in different networks.",

While we made best effort to capture all interactions available within our resources [19] and to control for research effort as per previous studies [9,12,16], we realize there are inherent biases in our data sources. Recent research has revealed that between 20 and 40% of pathogen host ranges are currently unknown [47]. An area of future improvement will therefore focus on closing this particular knowledge gap, furthering recent attempts to predict missing interactions in networks such as ours. Second, edges in our networks, which represent sharing of pathogens, may be interpreted in a variety of ways including: spillover; direct contact; indirect sharing through vectors, intermediate hosts or environment; and coevolution of specific host\u2013pathogen lineages. To further improve our models, we will aim to distinguish between these various events, focusing in particular on the role of transmission routes as means to include direction of pathogen sharing into our undirected networks. Third, we have focused our analyses on host and pathogen species interactions with minimal geographical layering. Geography plays a key role in facilitating host interactions and affects the probability of contact between humans and wildlife, which in turn increases chances of zoonotic transmission [5,48]. A future analysis will integrate geographical distribution of host species and will improve our ability to predict sources of zoonoses.",
