However, this protection is only partial, rarely totally preventing from infection, but slows down the transmission process among individuals and/or reduces clinical consequences whenever infections occur. Moreover, this protection is only temporary due to maternal antibodies waning and, in the absence of vaccination, individuals become fully susceptible to infection. Although vaccination could overcome this issue, several studies evidenced antagonistic effects between vaccine-induced immunity and maternally derived antibodies through inhibition of vaccine protection, which could potentially worsen the dynamics of infection [5]\u2013[9]. Hence, timely vaccination in regards to passive immunity waning appears crucial to optimize vaccine efficacy.",

Our model explicitly takes into account the distribution of passive immunity duration to define the transition rate between passively immune and susceptible states. The protective impact of passive immunity is assessed through the estimation of differential forces of infection (FOI), defined as the per capita rate of infection per time unit, in regards with the early life serological status (i.e. with or without maternally derived antibodies). A Bayesian approach, based on Monte-Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC), was used to estimate the protection conferred by maternally derived antibodies on the transmission process. Bayesian methodology is of particular interest for the estimations of parameters related to infectious disease dynamics [10]\u2013[18], since such data are subject to uncertainties due, for example, to under-reporting of cases, partially observed processes, or time-aggregated data.",

            "text": "As passive immunity was shown to be partially protective in the context of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in pigs [19], the developed methodology was applied to quantify the protection level conferred to new-born piglets by maternally derived antibodies (MDAs). Hepatitis E virus is a recognized zoonotic agent, which can cause enterically-transmitted hepatitis in humans, and for which domestic pigs are considered as the main reservoir [20]. Understanding the impact of passive immunity on infection dynamics is therefore of pivotal importance to identify strategies to decrease the prevalence of infected animals at slaughter time. To our knowledge, few studies have focused on quantifying the protection conferred by passive immunity (PI) in terms of pathogen transmission in pigs. In 1997, Bouma et al. calculated a reproduction number of 0.2 for pseudorabies virus in PI animals (vs. 6.3 in absence of MDAs) [5]. Another study on PCV-2 transmission demonstrated a two-fold reduction in pigs with MDAs and an estimated reproduction number of 1.5 [21]. Allerson et al. recently studied the transmission potential of swine influenza virus in the presence of homologous and heterologous MDAs (obtained from vaccinated dams) with regard to the challenge strain [22]. The results showed high protection with homologous MDAs but weaker protection in piglets born to sows vaccinated with a heterologous strain. The main risk regarding hepatitis E infection in humans in industrialized countries is the introduction of viremic pigs into the food chain, which is strongly related to the age at infection. Data from a cohort study were first used to characterize MDAs (IgG) kinetics in the early life of piglets (up to 14 weeks of age) and to estimate the distribution of the duration of passive immunity. A second dataset derived from a longitudinal study in 6 Spanish pig-herds [23] was then analyzed, accounting for previous estimates of MDAs waning time, to estimate forces of infection from herd-specific HEV prevalences.",

Distribution parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method and model selection was based on the AIC values. A nonparametric bootstrap procedure was used to determine the 95% confidence intervals for the parameter estimates and thus measure their accuracy. One thousand bootstrap replicates were generated by resampling individual profiles for each dataset.

Ten sows were chosen at random from this herd and from each followed batch. One week post-farrowing, 4 piglets born to the selected sows were chosen at random and ear-tagged.

The mean durations of PI were similar for all distributions but the gamma distribution was selected, based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

In contrast, in passively immune animals, the combined gamma-distributed duration of PI and the differential forces of infection produced sigmoid survival curves with a slight probability of infection in the presence of MDAs (before 7 weeks of age), followed by an increased probability of infection thereafter. In consequence, the infection-free survival age in piglets which had received maternal antibodies was much higher than in fully susceptible animals, ranging between 8.7 and 13.8 weeks.

Neonate piglets are thus susceptible to the majority of infectious agents to which they are exposed in early life. It is therefore essential to provide new-born piglets with MDAs via colostrum to protect them against viral and bacterial infections before their own immune system develops [31]. However, the protection conferred by PI has been shown to be partial for several pathogens, reducing the clinical expression and/or within\u2013host viral replication in infected piglets [21], [32]\u2013[35]. To our knowledge, the extent to which MDAs affect the transmission process has rarely been quantified to date [5], [21], [22]. We present an original approach to investigate and model the impact of PI on the transmission of an infectious agent in pigs based on batch-level prevalence data using two nested modeling structures: (i) differential forces of infection dependent on the serological status of piglets following colostrum intake (full model); and (ii) an equal force of infection exerted on fully susceptible and passively immune animals (SFOI model). This modeling approach, which combines a realistic distribution of the duration of PI and differential forces of infection, with and without maternal antibodies, provides a better understanding of early-life transmission of infectious agents. This approach was used to analyze serological data from a longitudinal study on hepatitis E prevalence in 6 pig herds.",

Indeed, the role of the environment on the course of infection was highlighted in a previous study, indicating that the force of infection represents a combination of transmission by direct contact between animals and ingestion of viral particles present in the environment [36]. Moreover, it is likely that the susceptibility to infectious agent in passively immune individuals varies as the level of maternally derived antibodies decreases with age. Thus, the estimated FOIs should be considered as the average infection pressure exerted on individuals to assess and quantify the protection conferred by PI. As all pigs within a specific herd were reared under the same conditions, the transmission process was summarized by forces of infection, by considering that a similar infection pressure was exerted on each individual independently of their serological status after colostrum intake. In consequence, the protection induced by PI is clearly related to a decrease in susceptibility.",

Data from a longitudinal survey in France were used to characterize the kinetics of maternally-derived antibodies in 120 piglets. The serological titers of piglets at 1 week of age were highly correlated with those of the dam, thus supporting previous observations [37], [38]. The duration of PI was modeled by a gamma distribution with a mean duration of 45.6 days [41.4; 50.4]. Although the duration was slightly shorter than in several epidemiological studies (8\u20139 weeks of age) [19], [37], [38], because of the gamma distribution, the probability of remaining passively immune fell below 0.1 by 60 days of age, as in these previous studies. In a recent study, the transmission parameters for hepatitis E virus in pigs were estimated from field data and the effectiveness of different hypothetical control strategies (early life vaccination and delayed vaccination around 10 weeks of age) was evaluated [18]. The author concluded that vaccination should lead to a 75% reduction of the main parameters governing the transmission process (host susceptibility, transmission rate or infectious period duration) to significantly decrease the expected prevalence at slaughter age. However, several studies showed interference between the maternally-derived antibodies and the immune response after vaccination [5], [6], [32], [39], [40]. Such interactions could have dramatic consequences on transmission. For example, the study by Bouma et al. revealed an increased reproduction number in piglets vaccinated against pseudorabies virus in the presence of PI as compared to vaccinated piglets without MDAs [5]. Further work should therefore be carried out to assess possible interactions between MDAs and future candidate vaccines before considering their usefulness in HEV control. However, a delayed vaccination strategy, as studied in [18], would certainly avoid such interactions as only 10% of piglets who received MDAs remained passively immune at 10 weeks of age.",

Two nested model structures were tested assuming either an equal force of infection in the presence and absence of MDAs (SFOI) or two different forces of infection (full model). However, neither model fitted the null prevalence observed at 3 weeks of age for two main reasons: (i) the estimated observed initial proportion of passively immune animals was about 60% in all herds so that 40% of the animals were deemed fully susceptible at birth; (ii) even in the presence of PI, piglets are not fully protected against infection as shown by the non negligible FOIs estimated in the presence of maternal antibodies. Moreover, only 20 piglets in each herd were sampled to establish the herd-specific seroprevalence profiles, which might have led to considerable uncertainty, especially if prevalence was low. These considerations are supported by the good concordance between the estimates and the data from 7 weeks of age onwards. In herd 2, the prevalence increased slowly, continuously and exponentially. Indeed the cumulative prevalence observed at slaughter age was about 50%. As the level of PI was similar to that of the other herds, this difference reflects a low infection pressure which might be due to differences in husbandry practices and herd structure.",

However, this relationship cannot be applied to the full model due to the interplay between piglet serological status and the differential forces of infection. The impact of PI on time-to-infection was therefore assessed by modeling the infection-free survival functions, i.e. the probability of escaping infection according to age of the animal, in piglets with and without MDAs, for each herd. In a fully susceptible animal, transmission occurs much earlier than in pigs with MDAs. Several epidemiological studies have shown that peak HEV prevalence occurs after the nursery stage, at about 13 weeks of age, which corresponds to the estimated median age at infection in passively immune individuals [19], [38], [42]. However, the predicted average age-at-infection in herd 2 was considerably higher and beyond the usual slaughter age (25 weeks). As the level of PI in all herds was similar, this difference could presumably only be explained by differences in herd structures and husbandry practices which might help to reduce the infection pressure due to piglet mixing and the environmental viral load. These results suggest that the age at HEV infection does not strictly depend on the proportion of passive immune piglets but also relies on later events which condition the force of infection after PI waning [43].",

In consequence, control measures in pig farms are aimed at preventing the presence of viremic animals at slaughter age. The modeling framework developed in this study was successfully used to evaluate the age at infection according to the serological status of piglets after colostrum intake in different pig farms. In herd 2, a large proportion of pigs remained susceptible before slaughter-age, mainly due to a lower force of infection after the wane of PI. These conditions could be associated with an increased risk as regards public health especially if later events, shortly before slaughter, enhance the infectious process and lead to massive infection of pigs. Further work needs to be carried out to fully understand which factors are involved in the resulting variations in forces of infection between herds.",
