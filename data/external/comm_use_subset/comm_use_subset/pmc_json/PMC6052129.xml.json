            "text": "Milk is the crucial natural source of nutrients for the growth of newborn mammals. Mammary glands undergo regular but complex cell proliferation and involution cycles after maturity (Gao et al., 2013). Lactation can be classified into three main steps: (1) early lactation where milk is produced in increasing trends, (2) peak production where energy balance is negative, and (3) late lactation where persistency of lactation is important, especially in dairy animals. Early lactation has great differences in gene expression profile with the ones form the late lactation (Strucken et al., 2015). So, elucidating the genes influencing each lactation time point can assist the animal breeders to accelerate the genetic improvement of dairy animals in breeding programs. Gene expression profiling of milk at different stages of lactation may reflect the molecular events of mammary glands (Farhadian et al., 2018). To provide a better understanding of milk production, unraveling molecular events in mammary glands is necessary.",

            "text": "One of the most studied animals for milk trait is Wallaby (Macropus eugenii). Wallaby has a short pregnancy that lasts for only 26 days followed by an extended lactation period of about 300 days with a lactation peak of 200 days postpartum (Lef\u00e8vre et al., 2010). Rat is another employed animal for milk research that produces multiple litters of milk during multiple gestations in a short period of time. In rat, peak lactation is around 12th day postpartum (Delongeas et al., 1997; Hadsell et al., 2012). In the context of animal breeding, peak lactation of dairy cow occurs 60\u201390 days postpartum. The gene expression data from wallaby, rat and cow can provide useful information for accurate discovery of key genes that control milk production. In line with this argument, the study of gene expression in mouse has facilitated the identification of candidate genes of milk production in cattle (Ron et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Important biological processes are often precisely conserved across related species (McCarroll et al., 2004; Wang and Rekaya, 2009). Meta-analysis and machine learning have the potential to uncover the common biosignature among mammals (Shekoofa et al., 2014; Ebrahimie et al., 2018; Farhadian et al., 2018; Sharifi et al., 2018). Recently, with availability of cross-species data, meta-analysis has been performed on multiple species (Lu et al., 2009). Individual studies have some limitations in their statistical power and reliability of the results. Meta-analysis, by combining data and results of different research, improves the statistical power and accuracy of expression estimates (Ramasamy et al., 2008; Sharifi et al., 2018). Transcriptomic meta-analysis can be classified into two types: co-expression meta-analysis and expression meta-analysis. Co-expression meta-analysis investigates whether genes co-expressed in one species are also co-expressed in another species. In contrast, expression meta-analysis investigates the commonality between expression profiles of homologous genes in different species. Significant strength of co-expression meta-analysis is that microarray experiments of different species can be combined even under different experimental conditions (Lu et al., 2009).",

Using publicly available high throughput microarray data, a meta-analysis was carried out in the current work to identify the DEGs between early (pre-peak) and late (post-peak) lactation. Meta-analysis is a powerful method for detection of the genes with small, but consistent effect on the trait of interest (Rest et al., 2016). The small-effect genes may neither be discoverable in a sole experiment nor be consistent in effect in multiple individually studied experiments. However, gathering information from multiple studies, as performed in meta-analysis, helps to discover these kind of effective genes more accurately. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the multiple publicly available microarray datasets belonging to the two important time points of lactation were analyzed. As the main result, we identified 31 (24 up- and 7 down-regulated) DEGs between the two specified stages of lactation from which ten DEGs were novel. These novel genes include six up-regulated (MRPS18B, SF1, UQCRC1, NUCB1, RNF126 and ADSL) and four down-regulated (TNNC1, FIS1, HES5 and THTPA) and are reported as milk production-related DEGs for the first time in the current work.",

Housekeeping genes tend to keep their expression relatively constant across various tissues or conditions. However, although there is no previous report about the possible effect of this gene on milk production, the significantly over expression of ATP5B at early stage of lactation, as compared to later stage of lactation, suggests an important role for ATP5B to contribute to the differences in milk production. In line with the previous reports, we found some DEGs with direct or indirect association with milk production including FTH1, TAGLN2, STMN1, TKT, RSU1, RPLP2, NDUFV2, LAS1L, KDELR2, TKT, PPIA, HSPA8, VAMP8, FOLR2, PRDX1 and ALPL. One of the most important genes express in secretary tissues, such as mammary gland, is VAMP8 (Ren et al., 2007). The expression of VAMP8 in the current study was significantly higher in pre-peak than the post-peak, probably due to the more milk production of secretary cells of mammary gland at earlier stage of lactation.",

Glutathione is a small molecular that affects the immune system (Perricone et al., 2009). Also, SOD2 acts as a regulator of immunity (Scheurmann et al., 2014). In addition to the enriched sub-networks related to immunity, the function of NUCB1 (Ma et al., 2014), RNF126 (Delker et al., 2013), FIS1 (Cheng et al., 2008), and TNNC1 (Augustin et al., 2016) genes were all reported to be related to the improvement of immune system. It can be concluded that, the activation of immune system is one of the most important functions of the DEGs. Therefore, it seems that one of the ways the DEGs affect the milk production is the development of immunity. In fact, animals with strong immunity against some disease (e.g., resistant to mastitis) produce more milk than non-healthy animals.",

It is regulated by 11 small molecules. Cell proliferation, the most relevant cell process related to CTNNB1, has been frequently referred to in the literature (Supplementary Data Sheet S4). In the network, CTNNB1 joined to LPL and CD44, which were both also central genes with a considerable number of connections. Interestingly, all of these three hub genes were down-regulated in the pre-peak rather than the post-peak. The important role of these three hub genes on the milk production was confirmed by all of the three algorithms (neighbor joining, common target, common regulation) used to construct the networks. The RNF43 had negative regulation effect on Wnt signaling pathway (Strikoudis et al., 2014). In addition, RNF43 was regulated by CTNNB1 and CD44. Therefore, it can be concluded that these genes regulate Wnt signaling pathway through negative effect on RNF43 and decline the production of milk at later days of lactation. There were other DEGs that related to cell proliferation and differentiation including SF1 (Tanaka and Nishinakamura, 2014); UQCRC1 (Zucchi et al., 2002); HES5 (Fathi et al., 2011); THTPA (Fischer-Fodor et al., 2015); ADSL (Skottman et al., 2005) and MRPS18B (Thompson-Crispi et al., 2014).",

According to Table 4, the organism feature attribute weighting is less than the most gene features. So, we conclude that, the type of organism has lower importance in this analysis. Milk production is influenced by many factors that can be classified into genetic and non-genetic factors. Since the lactation lasts for a long time in mammalian life, there should be some genes that regulate the entire lactation by keeping their expression relatively constant throughout the lactation. While some genes may go into considerable or negligible modifications in expression during the different stages of lactation and, thus, contribute to the corresponding differences exist in milk production at different stages of lactation. We investigated the possible modifications happen in gene expression between early and late stages of lactation and found out that genes related to the development of the mammary gland, proliferation and differentiation of cells as well as genes related to the improvement of immune system were mainly altered in their expression between the specified time-points of the lactation. We conclude that the development of immunity, especially at early stages of lactation, is probably very important. Because animals are very sensitive against pathogens and diseases like mastitis at early stages of lactation. Furthermore, the activation of genes related to cell proliferation and cell differentiation sustain the growth of mammary gland, especially after peak, and help milk production to continue more persistently.",

Our study suggests that the DEGs influence on milk production by improvement of immune system and cell differentiation. Milk production is a complex trait so considerably more work will need to be performed to identify all genes related to specific time points of lactation. Using attribute weighting models and counting the species as variable in addition to gene expression levels, we showed that the developed meta-analysis signature of lactation is species-independent and is common among species.
