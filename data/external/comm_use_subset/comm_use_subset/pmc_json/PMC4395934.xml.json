However, several concerns have been raised about the safety of the widespread use of nanoparticles [2,3]. Among these concerns, the potential toxicity of nanoparticles to humans is among the most distressing. Nanomaterials have been reported to be harmful at the cellular, subcellular, and protein levels, and they have been found to elicit injurious responses in various organisms [4-6]. Many of these studies have focused on lung diseases, including clinical studies of workers who developed pulmonary disease from nanoparticle exposure [7-11]. A worldwide moratorium on nanomaterials has even been called until the safety issues have been resolved [12]. Nanoparticle safety in the respiratory system is important not only for workers who have high exposure to the particles but also in pulmonary drugs where nanoparticles serve as a vehicle directly to the lung [13]. Therefore, it is of critical importance to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which nanoparticles induce lung injury.",

            "text": "Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers are a family of dendritic polymers that are based on an ethylenediamine core and repeated amidoamine branching. As PAMAM dendrimers grow through generations 1\u201310 (G1-G10, G represents the generation of the dendrimers, which are based on an ethylenediamine core and repeated amidoamine branching), their size increases from 1.1\u201312.4 nm [14,15]. PAMAM dendrimers are commercially available as either whole (cationic) or half (anionic) generation polymers. The low polydispersity index and the ability to precisely control their surface chemistry make dendrimers useful for biomedicine applications such as drug or gene delivery and diagnostic imaging [6,14]. For example, PAMAM dendrimers can be used to inhibit inflammation [16], improve therapeutic responses against cancer [17], and suppress HIV-1 infection [18]. In addition, PAMAM dendrimers can also be used as nanocarriers for pulmonary drug delivery [19,20] or as an effective vector for pulmonary gene transfer [21]. Because many PAMAM nanoparticles have been considered carriers for pulmonary drug delivery, in addition, a study reported that the PAMAM can be found in major organs and have highest levels in lungs in B16 melanoma and DU145 human prostate cancer mouse tumor model [22], the safety of PAMAM nanoparticles should be under rigorous assessment and evaluation [23].",

Although the systemic and oral toxicity of PAMAM nanoparticles has been investigated, there are few studies that have focused on the safety of PAMAM nanoparticles in the respiratory system. Considering the potential biomedical applications of PAMAM nanoparticles, especially the applications in pulmonary disease, it is paramount to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms that may be involved in PAMAM-induced lung injury in vivo.",

The G4, G5, G6, and G7 PAMAM dendrimers induced severe lung injury, as evidenced by an increased wet-to-dry weight ratio, which is a measure of lung edema and inflammation (Figure 1A). Among all of the tested nanoparticles, high generations of cationic PAMAM nanoparticles induced severe alterations in the lungs, whereas low generations of PAMAM and carboxyl-terminated dendrimers showed no acute toxicology; these results were consistent with previous studies [24,26-29]. Because G5 PAMAM nanoparticles (diameter is approximately 5 nm) exhibited the most severe acute lung injury, we focused on the G5 PAMAM nanoparticles in subsequent experiments. We also tested the acute toxicology of G5 PAMAM nanoparticles in vivo; the result showed that the LD50 of the G5 PAMAM nanoparticle was 11.22 \u03bcg/g and the 95% confidence limit was 9.89-12.74 \u03bcg/g (Table 1).",

Almost all mice treated with G5 PAMAM nanoparticle died within 48 hrs, whereas all control mice and mice instilled with anionic G5.5 PAMAM dendrimers survived (Figure 1B). The cause of death was rapid development of severe lung injury characterized by decreased blood oxygenation (Figure 1C), increased lung tissue wet-to-dry weight ratios (Figure 1D), and massively altered elastance (Figure 1E). (Lung elastance is a measure of lung function, i.e., the change in pressure per unit change in volume, and indicates the stiffness of the lungs [30].) The histopathology of G5 PAMAM-treated lungs showed increased bleeding and inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 1F). Moreover, G5 PAMAM administration resulted in increased vascular permeability (Figure 1G), another hallmark of acute lung injury/respiratory distress syndrome in humans [31,32]. These results indicate that the inhalation of G5 PAMAM nanoparticles induces acute lung injury in mice, resulting in pathologies that resemble acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans.",

            "text": "We previously discovered a role for ACE2 in protecting mice from severe acute lung injury [33-35]. ACE2 proteolytically cleaves angiotensin II (AngII) and thereby negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [36]. The induction of acute lung injury by acid aspiration, sepsis, or SARS-CoV resulted in the down-regulation of ACE2 expression in mouse lung tissue and the subsequent upregulation of AngII [33,34]. We also reported that plasma AngII levels are linked to disease severity and can predict fatal outcomes in H7N9-infected patients [37]. We therefore tested whether the RAS was also affected during nanoparticle-induced lung injury in mice. The serum AngII levels were measured in mice following the inhalation of PAMAMs, and other nanomaterials (Figure 2A, Additional file 2: Figure S1A). Additionally, ACE2 mRNA (Figure 2B) and protein levels in the lungs were determined (Figure 2C, Additional file 2: Figure S1B). The RAS system was markedly activated, as demonstrated by the increased serum AngII levels in mice treated with G4, G5, and G6 cationic PAMAM nanoparticles; the G5 PAMAM particles had the greatest effect (Figure 2A). Moreover, the inhalation of G5 and G6 PAMAM dendrimers resulted in significant down-regulation of ACE2 protein expression in lung tissue, again with G5 PAMAM inducing the greatest effect (Figure 2C). Inhalation of G4 and G7 PAMAM nanoparticles also resulted in reduced ACE2 expression in the lungs, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Notably, the lung levels of ACE, the enzyme that generates AngII [38], were apparently not affected by PAMAM inhalation (Figure 2C). Thus, the pulmonary administration of certain PAMAM nanoparticles, especially G5 PAMAM, markedly activate the RAS via the down-regulation of ACE2 expression.",

We assessed the binding affinity of ACE2 for various nanoparticles using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Interestingly, most cationic PAMAMs could bind ACE2 protein directly, whereas the anionic PAMAMs failed to bind ACE2 (Figure 2D, Additional file 3: Figure S2). This is predictable since the theoretical isoelectric point of protein ACE2 calculated by Expasy (http://www.expasy.org) is 5.36 and the SPR assay is performed in neutral pH. The dynamic binding constants and equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding between the examined nanoparticles and ACE2 were also measured, demonstrating that G5 PAMAM nanoparticles, in particular, strongly bind to ACE2 (Additional file 4: Table S2). We next monitored ACE2 enzyme activity by measuring AngII levels after mixing recombinant ACE2 protein and various nanoparticles in vitro. The enzymatic activity of ACE2 was decreased after incubation with cationic G5 PAMAM nanoparticles, but its activity was not affected after incubation with anionic G5.5 PAMAM in vitro (Figure 2E). These data show that G5 PAMAM nanoparticles can directly associate with ACE2 and alter its enzymatic activity, thereby resulting in activation of the RAS.",

As measured by Evans blue vascular leakage assays, losartan also significantly decreased the vascular permeability of the pulmonary blood vessels in G5 PAMAM-treated mice (Figure 4F). In addition, treatment with losartan ameliorated G5 PAMAM-induced lung histopathology, including bleeding and inflammation cell infiltration (Figure 4G). Furthermore, we measured interleukin-6 (IL-6), which was a classical pro-inflammatory cytokine, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).

Our data provide in vivo molecular insight into the acute lung failure that can be induced by nanomaterials. Our data indicate that G5 PAMAM dendrimers down-regulate ACE2 expression in lung tissue, resulting in increased AngII production and, consequently, acute lung failure. Our SPR data show that PAMAM G5 and protein ACE2 have the highest binding affinity (Additional file 4: Table S2), however, PAMAM G7 have the most amino surface groups (Additional file 1: Table S1), suggesting that the nanoparticles surface charge is not the only determinant. Further studies of conformation characteristic and stability of PAMAM G5-ACE2 complex are needed.",

            "text": "In our study, PAMAM nanoparticles of G4-G7 could induce lung edema (Figure 1A), whereas lower generation cationic and anionic PAMAM dendrimers exhibited no acute lung toxicity. This result is consistent with previous findings that state nanoparticle size significantly influences the toxicology of PAMAM nanoparticles [24]. It is interesting to note that not all nanoparticles have such effects on the ACE2 and AngII levels; for example, G5.5 PAMAM dendrimers appear to be less toxic than G5 PAMAM dendrimers. Additional studies regarding the entry of nanoparticles into pulmonary epithelial cells and/or local resident macrophages are required to explain these differences. Nevertheless, minor modifications of nanomaterials appear to significantly reduce their pulmonary toxicity, suggesting a possible approach to enable a safer use of nanomaterials. We have previously shown that G3-8 cationic PAMAM nanoparticles, COOH single-walled carbon nanotube, and copper oxide nanoparticles induce autophagy in vitro in A549 cell models or in vivo in mouse models [9,39,40]. Thus, the severity of the lung injury triggered by PAMAM nanoparticles may be due to the activation of multiple signaling pathways that collectively cause severe lung disease. A previous study showed that AngII could increase autophagy levels via activation of the AT1 receptor and NADPH oxidase in vascular muscle cells [41]; whether this signaling transduction pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of lung failure induced by G5 PAMAM nanoparticles needs further study. Our new data now clearly establish that ACE2 and the RAS play key roles in G5 PAMAM nanoparticle-induced lung injury. Interestingly, these mechanisms also apply in severe acute lung injury associated with acid aspiration, sepsis, or infection with SARS-CoV, H5N1 and H7N9 influenza [33-35,42]. Thus, these parallel mechanisms suggest that ACE2 and RAS share a common disease mechanism for acute lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome. Modulating the RAS may have a wide range of therapeutic applications.",
