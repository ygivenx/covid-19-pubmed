            "text": "The Ranunculaceae is a small family with five genera and around 19 species found throughout the World. Currently, about nine Cimicifuga species grow in China. C.\nsimplex (Shengma in Chinese) is a deciduous perennial herb widely distributed in China. Traditionally, the root of C.\nsimplex has been used in oriental countries as an anti-inflammatory and anti-viral agent [1,2,3] and the beneficial ingredients responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects are ferulic acid and isoferulic acid [4,5]. This herb has also been used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and its more general analgesic, antipyretic, antidiabetes, antimalaria and vasoactive properties [3,4,5]. Its chemical constituents have been extensively investigated and the main constituents are 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides, flavonoids, alkaloids, and chromones [6,7,8,9]. More than 200 uncommon cycloartane-type triterpenoid saponins have been isolated from Cimicifuga plants [6]. Genjiro and his team have isolated more than fifty cycloartane-type triterpenoids from C. simplex grown in Japan [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. It was reported that 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpene glycosides exhibited antiosteoporosis, anti-tumor and anti-complement activities [23,24,25]. Furthermore, triterpenoids may be useful candidates for the development of new drugs for cardiovascular disorders due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [3]. In continuation of our search for pharmacological and structurally interesting substances from Chinese traditional herbal drugs, we investigated the chemical constituents of C.\nsimplex. Fractionation of the ethyl acetate soluble extract of the roots of C.\nsimplex by column chromatography afforded three new cycloartane-type triterpenoid saponins (Figure 1). We report here on the isolation and structural elucidation of these compounds by chemical and spectroscopic analysis.",

The presence of a galacose was further confirmed by its NMR data [16], and the galactose linkage was assigned as \u03b2 from observation of the anomeric proton coupling constant at \u03b4H 4.89 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz). The residual three further signals at \u03b4H 4.60 (1H, ddd, J = 2.0, 4.3, 9.2 Hz), 4.53 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz) and 3.77 (1H, d, J = 4.4 Hz) in the region of aglycon moiety suggest three additional oxygen-bearing carbons on the aglycone. This hypothesis was confirmed by the HMBC spectrum, which showed cross-peaks between proton signal at \u03b4H 4.53 (1H,d, J = 7.6 Hz) with C-14 and C-16, C-13 and C-17, between proton signal at \u03b4H 4.60 (1H, ddd, J = 2.0, 4.3, 9.2 Hz) with C-24 and C-22, and between proton signal at \u03b4H 3.77 (1H, d, J = 4.4 Hz) with C-23 and C-25. This unambiguously iindicated that the oxygen-bearing carbons are C-15, C-23 and C-24. In the HMBC spectrum, significant correlations between \u03b4H 4.89(H-1') and 88.4(C-3) suggested that the galactopyranosyl was located at the C-3 position. Furthermore, the long-range correlations between an acetyl proton (\u03b4H 2.01) with C-25 (\u03b4C 79.8) indicated that the acetyl unit locating at C-25. Other key long-range correlations were observed for H-19/C-19, H-1'/C-3, H-24/C-25, H-23/C-22 and C-24, and an acetyl methyl proton and an acetyl carbon and C-25. ",

The reduced sugars were acetylated with 1:1 pyridine-Ac2O in a boiling water bath for 2 h to give the corresponding alditol acetates, which were analyzed by GLC on a HP 6890 N gas chromatograph (Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector FID) using N2 as carrier gas. The instrument was fitted with a HP-5 capillary column (30 m\u00d70.32mm\u00d70.25 \u03bcm). The injector temperature was set at 250 \u00b0C and the column temperature program was as follows: the initial temperature of 120 \u00b0C was increased by 3\u00b0/min to the final temperature of 210 \u00b0C, then was held 4 min. The detector temperature was set at 300 \u00b0C. The standard monosaccharides were subjected to the same reaction and GC analysis under the same conditions (D-galacose, tR, 30.8 min)",

As a part of our chemical investigation on C. simplex, three new cycloartenol triterpene saponins with galactopyranosyl moieties, shengmaxinsides A-C, were isolated. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and chemical evidence. Their biological activities will be further researched in our laboratory. ",
