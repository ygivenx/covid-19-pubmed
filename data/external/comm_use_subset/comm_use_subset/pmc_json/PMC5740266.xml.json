LBMs are a known source of AI in which high densities of poultry, unhygienic conditions, infected drinking water and dust particles all serve to amplify transmission [3\u20136]. The continuous introduction of naive birds into LBMs replacing those sold ensures that the pool of hosts susceptible to infection is continuously replenished, facilitating ongoing transmission of AI within LBMs. In addition, the movement of humans and poultry between farms and markets across different geographical areas further contributes to the spread of multiple AI strains [3,5].",

While the concept has been used for infectious diseases of humans for many years [8] and also within wildlife populations [9] it has not been applied to the persistence of AI in a multi-strain system. The persistence of AI within LBMs is of public health and evolutionary importance; if multiple different AI strains persist in LBMs, there is greater opportunity for co-infection, where a co-infection is the presence of at least two independent viruses within a single host. Frequent co-infections with genetically distinct viruses increase the opportunity for novel viruses to be generated through reassortment.",

Because co-infection of a host with two different strains is a necessary prerequisite for reassortment to occur, the higher the number of co-infection events that occur, the greater the chance that transmissible and pathogenic novel reassortant progeny will be generated. Here, we use the word strain to describe a distinct lineage that may reassort with another lineage. Currently, we have a poor understanding of the frequency of co-infection in LBMs and the factors driving persistence [16]. A better understanding of factors that predict the persistence of multiple strains would provide a foundation for advancing our ability to predict the risk of reassortment. Worryingly, an increasing number of studies are showing that reassortment between different AI subtypes and human endemic subtypes can readily occur [17,18] and spillover of AI infections into the human population continue to be reported as a consequence of exposure to LBMs.",

Therefore, further investigation is required at points in the supply chain prior to birds entering LBMs.",

Here we use a multi-strain stochastic susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model to investigate the drivers of single and co-infecting strains, where co-infecting strains are two genetically distinct, independent viruses within a single host. Subsequent reassortment that may occur following co-infection is not considered. We assess how different parameters impact the persistence probability of a single AI strain, we determine the CCS for single and co-infecting strains, and the relationship between the CCS, market turnover rate and the R0 of co-circulating strains. We highlight high-risk features of LBM systems that may increase opportunities for AI persistence. We then use time series data collected in Shantou, China, in 2006 to explore the mechanisms that may generate the non-persistent multi-strain dynamics observed in surveillance data from a wLBM.",

Interactions and importations between external farms and the market were modelled such that at one time point within a day, birds would be brought into the market and at the same time point approximately the same proportion were sold onwards (i.e. instantaneous turnover). As turnover rates within markets remain poorly quantified, we also examined the effects of different fixed turnover rates (above and below 50%) on our model outcomes. We assumed the market population size remained approximately constant, which is the prevailing opinion of fieldworkers as physical space is a scarce resource within LBMs and is therefore highly utilized [19,20]. However, although the market population may be approximately constant across days (except at major holidays), it is unlikely to be constant throughout the course of a day\u2014i.e. most birds come in in the morning (highest population size) and gradually leave throughout the day (population size decreases gradually throughout the day). Thus, we also evaluated how fluctuations in population throughout the day impacted CCS estimates. Insights from the variable population sizes throughout the day could be extrapolated to interpret the effects of variable population sizes during holiday seasons.",

Exposed (E) birds were infected but not infectious to other birds, and susceptible to infection with a second strain. I birds were infectious to other birds, and temporarily immune to infection with a second strain [24,25] as a consequence of the innate immune response to infection [26]. In terms of adaptive immunity, R birds were fully recovered, and immune to re-infection with the same strain (i.e. full homologous immunity) but were susceptible to infection with a second strain with the same probability as fully susceptible hosts (S) (no cross-immunity). States in which birds were S, E, I or R to both strains were denoted as subscripted state symbols. We do not explicitly model particular AI strains, but generally model possible multi-strain dynamics. Additional model description is provided in the electronic supplementary information. Co-infection here represents simultaneous infection with strain A and B, thus our notation for co-infection reflects the host's state. Supporting quantitative evidence for the relative infectivity of two strains in co-infected birds was limited, therefore, we assumed co-infected birds always transmitted strains A and B concurrently (i.e. equal fitness for both strains) and that this led to direct co-infection in a susceptible bird. As a minimum criteria for co-infection, each individual strain must be capable of establishing sustained transmission for a period of time in a rapid-turnover market. Therefore, we define Rtotal0 for a single strain as the sum of Rwf0 and Renv0.",

The definition for the persistence of co-infecting strains is more complicated. Even if direct transmission of the co-infecting strain fades out, if both individual strains are still circulating, direct transmission of the co-infecting strains can re-emerge. Thus, we calculate the CCS for the persistence of the co-infecting strains by considering the frequency with which a single introduction of both strains separately results in an epidemic of the co-infecting strains which persists for at least 1 year, ensuring the number of birds infected with strain A and B (individually), or strain AB is greater than 1 at the end of the year.

Studies have shown that higher volumes of minor poultry sales resulted in a significant increase in virus isolation rates [20], and that live poultry market density was the most important predictor of H7N9 infection risk within poultry markets [31].

However, given the short average stay times of birds within the market system modelled, our assumption should not impact our findings on AI persistence. Within the system modelled there is competition for susceptible hosts, therefore if there were marked differences in fitness between the two strains it is possible that one strain may outcompete the other. The environmental transmission parameters were selected based on estimates from experimental data and values previously used in modelling studies, however, there remains large uncertainty in these values [3,21,23].
