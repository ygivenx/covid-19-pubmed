The cellular miRNA genes could encode the endogenous cellular miRNAs [3,4]. Because the structures of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are similar to the structures of pre-miRNAs, shRNAs are used as the precursor molecules of siRNA in cells.",

During virus infection, the anti-viral activity of RNA silencing could be activated by the emergence of virus-specific dsRNA or miRNA, finally destroying the RNA of the virus. However, during the co-evolutionary process of the virus and the cellular RNA silencing process, the viruses have produced suppressors of RNA silencing (RSSs) to overcome the anti-viral RNA silencing [8,9]. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggested that RNA silencing might also be an important innate antiviral immunity in vertebrates [5,10,11,12]. Firstly, the RNA silencing pathway in mammal cells is competent. Secondly, small RNAs induced by the virus have been identified in several animal viruses [13]. Thirdly, inactivation of Dicer could influence the replication of animal viruses [9,14,15,16]. Finally, many animal viruses encoded RSSs to inhibit RNA silencing [5].",

            "text": "It is clear that PRRSV could inhibit the RNA-induced gene silencing, and conversely, it is an attractive notion that the RNA silencing may be an anti-viral response to PRRSV. In this work, specific siRNAs or shRNAs were used to reduce the expression of endogenous Dicer to address whether the RNA silencing system played an important role in regulating PRRSV replication. Through detecting the mRNA or protein expression of Dicer, it was clear that siRNAs and shRNAs could respectively reduce the expression of Dicer (Figure 2C\u2013F and Figure 3C\u2013F). The results in Figure 2 and Figure 3 show that downregulation of Dicer enhanced the viral titers (Figure 2G,H and Figure 3G,H) and the levels of PRRSV RNA (Figure 2A,B and Figure 3A,B) in MARC-145 cells (Figure 2) and Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) (Figure 3). Next, to confirm the above results, the specific shRNA targeting Ago-2 was used in the following experiment. The results of qRT-PCR in Figure 4A and the results of Western bots in Figure 4B,C show that the shRNAs could significantly downregulate Ago-2 expression in MARC-145 cells. Meanwhile, Figure 4A,D also shows that downregulation of Ago-2 enhanced the levels of PRRSV RNA and the viral titers in MARC-145 cells, respectively.",

The virus genome could induce an RNAi-based antiviral response, since the viral genome could form a double-stranded RNA intermediate, local secondary structures and overlapping virus transcripts during viral replication. It is worth debating whether the RNA silencing also plays an important role in controlling animal virus, and more and more evidence indicates that RNA silencing is also a part of the innate immunity of animals to the virus [5,10]. For example, Chinnappan et al. [9] have found that both downregulation of Dicer and Ago-2 enhanced HBV replication, and the viral titers of HBV were negatively correlated with the mRNA levels of Dicer and Ago-2; in a further study, it was found that the HBx protein was the important RSS of HBV. Maillard et al. [11] showed that ablating a Nodamura virus (NoV)-encoded RSS could deregulate viral replication, while a Dicer-deficient mouse cell line could rescue this mutant NoV and enhanced NoV replication.",

The experimental results showed that PRRSV could suppress the RNA silencing induced by shRNA, dsRNA and miRNA (Figure 1), so it was reasonable to speculate that PRRSV modified the antiviral response of RNA silencing if the RNA silencing could be a partial anti-PRRSV response. Thereby, we tested whether the RNA silencing could be a part of the anti-PRRSV response. Because the proteins Dicer and Ago-2 are the cellular RNA silencing apparatus for shRNA, dsRNA and miRNA-induced RNA silencing, both silencing Dicer and silencing Ago-2 enhanced PRRSV replication (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4), which indicated that RNA silencing could be a defense system against PRRSV. Therefore, our present work provides new evidence that RNA silencing may be as an antiviral immunity to the invading virus in mammal cells.",

Similar to the above results, this work not only showed that the PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp11 were the RSSs, but also demonstrated that the activity of PCP\u03b1 and the activity of endoribonuclease were respectively required for nsp1\u03b1 and nsp11 as the RSSs (Figure 5). In fact, the relationship between the IFN pathway and the RNA silencing pathway may be an interesting topic in the future, since it suggests that the RNA silencing and the IFN pathway are overlapping. Firstly, some viral components antagonize both the RNA silencing and IFN response. For example, the most discovered RSSs were also the antagonists of type I interferon [5]. Secondly, some miRNA could be induced by IFN cytokine, and miRNA could regulate the IFN system. Thirdly, adenosine deaminase acting on the production of miRNA was also an effector of the IFN system. Therefore, the relationship between RNA silencing and the IFN system suggests that both RNA silencing and the IFN system were the first line against animal virus infections. However, the detailed mechanism of the interaction between RNA silencing and the IFN system deserves further study.",
