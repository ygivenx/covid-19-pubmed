Evidence of PRV infection in humans has been reported in various locations in Southeast Asia (Figure 1). In a molecular surveillance study in Rembau, Malaysia, PRV was detected in oropharyngeal swabs from 17% of out-patients suffering from acute respiratory tract infections [7] and in serological studies on select populations, PRV seroprevalence rates range from 4.4\u201313% [7\u20139]. Although direct bat-to-human transmission was likely the route of transmission in the PRV3M outbreak [3], it is less clear whether bats played a direct role in transmitting the viruses to humans in the other reported cases of human infection. The high prevalence in selected populations from the recent surveillance studies supports the possibility of transmission by reservoir or intermediate hosts, which may have closer contact with humans than bats.\n",

It is well known that interspecies transmission of bat-borne viruses is a source of disease outbreaks in the human population and indeed evidence of bat-to-human transmission of PRV has been demonstrated [3,13]. In contrast to all previous discoveries, non-human primates were the source of the most recent PRV detection. Given the cross-species transmission of PRVs and frequent human-monkey interaction in Singapore and surrounding regions, we initiated this study to determine the seroprevalence of PRV3M in wild cynomolgus macaques and to examine the susceptibility of cynomolgus macaques to experimental infection with PRV3M and their potential role in acting as hosts facilitating cross-species transmission. Non-human primates may serve as natural reservoirs and maintain PRV, or act as intermediate hosts to provide a link for virus transmission between bats and humans.",

An initial screening was performed using a PRV3M whole virus-based ELISA. By using three standard deviations of the geometric mean as a cut-off, 67 serum samples were identified as reactive to PRV3M (Figure 2(a), Table 1). To further confirm the positivity of the samples and increase specificity, a serum neutralization test against PRV3M was performed on all ELISA positive serum samples. A total of 34 serum samples were able to neutralize PRV3M at a dilution of at least 1:10 (Table 1). To further confirm the specificity, Western blot analysis was conducted using purified virions. Shown in Figure 2(b) is a representative Western blot conducted with sample #6301, a known positive sample with a high neutralizing antibody titre, and a negative control sample, both used at dilution of 1:500. The Western blot analysis not only confirmed findings from ELISA and VNT, but also revealed that the major outer capsid protein (mu1) was the most reactive viral protein (Figure 2(b)).\n",

Furthermore, as the immunobiology of humans is more closely related to monkeys than bats, host-adaptation within monkeys could serve to enhance the virulence or transmission efficiency of PRV in humans. Given the overlapping habitats of bats and monkeys, interspecies transmission to monkeys and subsequent pathogen adaptation could be a relevant theme in the broader context of bat-borne virus spillover to humans, and warrants further investigation. Finally, the recent report by a group in Thailand on the isolation and characterization of a PRV from monkey faecal samples ruled out contamination of these samples with bat faeces. During analysis of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene, bat DNA was not detected in the faecal samples, emphasizing monkeys, especially a long-tailed macaque, as potential reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, such as PRV [18].
