The alphabaculoviruses can be further divided into Group I and Group II, based on phylogenetic analysis and their membrane fusion proteins. Group I viruses use GP64 as the fusion protein while Group II viruses use F-protein instead [6\u20138]. Phylogeny analysis suggested that Group I fall into two clades, \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d [9]. Despite the diversity in gene content of baculovirus genomes, 37 have been identified as core genes present in all sequenced baculoviral genomes and play very important roles in the viral replication cycle [10]. In addition, there are 23 genes conserved in all sequenced lepidopteran baculoviruses (NPVs and GVs) and 11 are specific to Group I [10\u201313].",

Although deletion of fgf from AcMNPV had no effect on replication in tissue culture cells, bioassays showed that time of death in larvae was delayed [24]. It has been suggested that FGF may play a role in dissemination of the virus within the host insect [25].
