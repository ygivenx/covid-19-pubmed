The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which started in China in the city of Wuhan likely from a wet market of live animals, has caused a rapid increase in the number of infections and deaths across Chinese borders, and has become a serious public and global health threat.",

Prevention activities are difficult to implement because events causing the emerge or re-emerge of zoonoses are complex and affected by multiple factors, such as genetic evolution, demographic changes, environmental conditions, or climate changes affecting the ecosystem.",

The fact that the beginning of the nCoV-2019 outbreak was observed by at least one physician, as reported by The Guardian on February 2, but not perceived as an urgent threat at the level of decision makers, demonstrates the essential need to identify what could be done better\u2014before new diseases emerge\u2014therefore preventing future outbreaks or, at least, reducing their impact.",

At present, the main players of the network are in place (eg, medical doctors, veterinarians, public health experts, and food quality inspectors), but they act separately; for example, veterinarians are not connected with occupational physicians, and in turn they are not in contact with general practitioners who are at the frontline of the disease. Therefore, in the current system, a cohesive network able to receive and act on early warnings at different levels is missing.",

The concept of One Health recognises the interdependence of human health, animal health, and environmental health, and aims to achieve better public health outcomes through the understanding and prevention of risks that originate at the interface between humans, animals, and their environments. Such approach implies a multidisciplinary effort in the implementation of programmes, policies, and research, where multiple sectors communicate and work together, with the common goal of helping disease prediction, prevention, and preparedness.",

A year later, as a result of this partnership, they released a guide (Taking a multisectoral, one health approach: a tripartite guide to addressing zoonotic diseases in countries) that provides principles and best practices to assist countries in achieving sustainable and functional collaboration at the human-animal-environment interface.",

Rare examples are the University of Washington's Center for One Health Research (Seattle, WA, USA) or the Global Health department at Harvard University (Boston, MA, USA), which has recently promoted the cross-education of its practitioners by collaborations with veterinaries. In public health, interestingly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is following One Heath strategies against some zoonoses. An example is the response to the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Virus outbreak in East Africa in 1997. Most of the human infections resulted from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. To break the chain of transmission, CDC researchers developed a vaccine to vaccinate animals against RVF, therefore preventing its transmission to humans.",

Some professions have greater exposure to zoonotic risks than others\u2014eg, farmers or butchers. Nearly half of the first patients affected by COVID-19 were working at the wet market where the virus originated, according to the first clinical characterisation provided by Chen and colleagues from The University of Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen Hospital (Shenzhen, China), and published by The Lancet in January. Those occupational categories deserve attention as groups at particular risk of zoonotic exposure. In public health departments the collaboration between hygienists, occupational physicians, general practitioners, and veterinarians could provide a push to implement monitoring activities, where the health of workers, animals, and the general population are jointly monitored.",

Now it is time to embrace One Health as a framework for public health action against zoonoses, as suggested by the tripartite (WHO, FAO, OIE) zoonotic guide. Governments must prioritise strategies to introduce the One Health approach in education and training programmes and in their public health systems, both at the national and international level. The timely recognition of the interconnection between humans, animals, and environment, intrinsic in the One Health approach, is a key prerequisite for understanding and managing the future of global health threats.",
