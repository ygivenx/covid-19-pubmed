However, evidence also indicates that: 1) H7N9 viruses are transmissible from ferrets in a direct contact setting [5\u20137]; 2) they can bind to both human and avian receptors [8]; 3) they can attach to the epithelium in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans [9]; and 4) they efficiently propagate in human alveolar tissue [10]. All of these features are important factors for human-to-human transmission. Fortunately, H7N9 viruses do not appear to transmit easily from person to person. However, there are many more factors that are important in the adaptation to sustained inter-human transmission. In this scenario, primary cultures of human respiratory tract epithelial cells would be invaluable to understand H7N9 virus tissue tropism and pathogenesis, as well as to evaluate how patient-related characteristics can modulate the host's response to infection.",

An age- and sex-based analysis of 63 patients infected by the H7N9 virus showed that elderly men are most commonly affected, whereas no deaths were observed in elderly women. Age-dependent changes in the airway epithelium mean that older patients may be more prone to respiratory tract infections [16] and the development of symptomatic H7N9 disease [11]. Moreover, the presence of comorbidities is the only independent risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome in H7N9-infected individuals [2]. In the most recent epidemic episode in China (during September to December 2016 (n = 114)), distributions of age, sex, and severe illness remained unchanged compared with other epidemics [3]. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which age, sex, medical comorbidity, and obesity can influence H7N9 virus replication kinetics remain unclear. However, numerous studies have shown that increased levels of specific proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are robust predictors of morbidity and mortality in H7N9-infected patients [2, 8, 17\u201320].",

While these studies have recognized many important characteristics that can help to understand the pathogenesis of influenza viruses, few studies have investigated person-to-person differences in virus replication and the influenza-related cytokines and chemokines of respiratory epithelial cell cultures. Recently, Mindaye et al. [26] found different protein expression levels of pro-viral and antiviral factors among normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells isolated from three different donors, and suggested that this model may provide a way to identify individuals or population groups who are susceptible to severe influenza disease. In the present study, we addressed the hypothesis that respiratory epithelial cells from different human donors would vary in their response to influenza virus infections. To determine the impact of age on cellular response after influenza virus infection, commercial NHBE cells cultured from 24-year-old and 69-year-old donors were infected with both H1N1pdm virus (A/California/07/2009 [27]) and avian H7N9 virus (A/Taiwan/4-CGMH/2014 [28]), and viral growth kinetics and the cytokine response were compared. We further explored how different donors\u2019 characteristics (i.e., age, sex, medical comorbidities, and obesity) could influence both virus replication kinetics and the cytokine response to experimental H7N9 infections. Human respiratory tract primary epithelial cells were cultured from patients undergoing upper or lower airway surgery and experimentally infected with H7N9. The limited amount of primary epithelial cells available from each patient meant that only H7N9 virus infection was conducted.",

In the H1N1pdm virus or H7N9 virus-infected supernatants, viral RNA quantity reached a plateau between 48 and 72 h p.i. (P = 0.753 and 0.249, respectively). Table 1 summarizes the viral RNA quantity in influenza virus-infected culture supernatants harvested from NHBE cells isolated from two different donors. Differences in viral RNA quantities between H7N9 and H1N1pdm virus infections were not significant at each time point in the same NHBE cells. Viral RNA quantities of both influenza viruses measured in culture medium of NHBE cells obtained from a 24-year-old female donor were significantly higher than those obtained from a 69-year-old donor at each time point (P = 0.041, 0.002, 0.002, and 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the viral RNA quantity detected in H7N9-infected cell culture medium of the 24-year-old NHBE cells was the highest among all cultures from 48 to 72 h p.i., whereas the viral RNA quantity of the H1N1pdm-infected 69-year-old culture medium was the lowest from 24 to 72 h p.i.

            "text": "Influenza virus infection can induce a cytokine storm, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 are key cytokine storm mediators [29]. An early-onset cytokine storm is associated with H7N9-related mortality [18, 20]; therefore, we specifically focused on the six cytokines that were found to most consistently predict death in previous studies (i.e., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and TNF-\u03b1). Such molecules are also produced by human airway epithelial cells [30\u201334], and are termed \u201ccore cytokines\u201d in the present study. In cases in which the cytokine concentration was undetectable, we assumed a value of 0.1 pg/mL for statistical purposes, in accordance with the recommendation of Guo et al. [20]. Figure 1B shows that the IL-1\u03b2 levels in the culture media of H7N9 virus-infected 24-year-old NHBE cells were significantly higher than those of the Mock and H1N1pdm virus-infected 24-year-old NHBE cells at 48 and 72 h p.i. The IL-1\u03b2 levels of the H7N9 virus-infected 69-year-old NHBE cells were significantly higher than those of Mock and H1N1pdm virus-infected 69-year-old NHBE cells at 48 h p.i. Figure 1C reveals that the IL-6 levels in the culture media were not related to virus type or the donor's age. In Figure 1D, the IL-8 level of the culture medium of H7N9-infected 24-year-old NHBE cells was significantly higher than those of the Mock and H1N1pdm infected cells. Figure 1E shows that the IFN-\u03b3 level of H7N9-infected NHBE cells (either 24-year-old or 69-year-old) was significantly higher than those of the Mock and H1N1pdm infected cells. Figure 1F demonstrates that levels of IP-10 in H7N9-infected 69-year-old NHBE cells were significantly higher than the others at 24, 48, and 72 h p.i., whereas those of H7N9 and H1N1pdm virus-infected 24-year-old NHBE culture media were significantly higher than that of Mock at 72 h p.i. Figure 1G demonstrates that the levels of TNF-\u03b1 of H7N9 virus-infected NHBE cells obtained from 24-year-old and 69-year-old donors were significantly higher than the others at 72 h p.i.",

In the present study, our objectives were to discover whether viral replication and cytokine responses of NHBE cells from two donors of different ages are distinct after H7N9 and H1N1pdm virus infection, and to validate whether these changes are different after H7N9 virus infection using primary epithelial cells from the respiratory tracts of 27 donors with various patient-related characteristics. In the second model, we used a primary culture approach to possibly retain the effects of patient-related characteristics.

Intriguingly, infections of the upper airways were associated with a marked release of IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 within 72 h p.i. These observations suggested that the H7N9 virus infection induces a site-specific, amplified, local innate immune response [44]. Notably, Chan et al. [22] found that H7N9 virus infection did not enhance the mRNA expression of IL-8 in peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages.

These observations may be attributable to \u201cimmunosenescence,\u201d i.e. an age-related decline in immune function accompanied by the dysfunction of chemokine signaling pathways [45]. In contrast, younger subjects are more likely to survive after H7N9 infection [2, 10\u201314]. It is possible that the high viral replication occurring in their respiratory tract can act as a reservoir [46, 47].

In our study, cells from patients with medical comorbidities produced higher IL-8 levels after experimental infection compared with those from otherwise healthy individuals, which might explain the absence of an association between medical comorbidities and the severity of H7N9 infections after adjustment for age and sex [14]. Obesity was significantly associated with a higher increase in viral RNA quantities; a higher level of IL-8 at 24 h and a lower level at 72 h p.i.; and less pronounced increases in IL-1\u03b2 and IP-10. Our data indicated that cells derived from obese individuals have subtle but widespread changes in viral replication and cytokine response following experimental H7N9 infection.

Second, because of the limited amount of primary epithelial cells, we did not include control virus infections in the primary culture model of explanted cells to verify the viral response. However, we confirmed that the H7N9 virus could replicate and induce a cytokine response differently from H1N1pdm virus in the NHBE experiment. Moreover, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus A/Anhui/1/13 could attach moderately or abundantly to both the upper and lower respiratory tract, and could be replicated in primary cultures of the nasopharynx and bronchus [9]. Nevertheless, the primary epithelial cells used in the present study seemed to reflect the properties of virus infection in patients, where the virus interacts with primary epithelial cells. Finally, the relatively small sample size precluded the analysis of a greater number of host characteristics that could affect virus replication kinetics and cytokine response. Further studies are needed to confirm and expand our findings.",

Interestingly, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 were the most differentially influenced by grouped host-specific features. Our results require independent replication in clinical studies before the widespread use of our primary cellular model can be recommended. However, our platform is less costly and labor-intensive than the use of animal models to mimic H7N9 virus infection. Our preliminary results using a primary cellular model have revealed many interesting differences among patient responses, and might represent a potential tool to identify individuals more prone to developing severe H7N9 infections.",

We used the FluA primers and probe originally developed by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre in Beijing, China (2013). The nucleotide sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5\u2032-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3\u2032; reverse primer, 5\u2032- AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA-3\u2032; probe, 5\u2032-FAM-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-BHQ1-3\u2032. In brief, 140 \u03bcL of supernatant was mixed with 560 \u03bcL of lysis buffer (350 \u03bcL for up to 5 \u00d7 106 cells). The volume of extracted RNA was adjusted to 30 \u03bcL with RNase-free water. Negative controls consisted of sterile water and were subjected to all the preparation steps in parallel with the extracted samples. A RealTime ready RNA virus master kit (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH Mannheim, Germany) was used for amplification. To set up the amplification reaction, 5 \u03bcL of template was added to each reaction tube; the working concentrations for the primers and probe were 10 and 5 \u03bcM, respectively. The final volume for the qRT-PCR was 25 \u03bcL. Reverse transcription and amplification were carried out in a one-step reaction on a Bio-Rad PCR system (CFX96; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The conditions for qRT-PCR were as follows: 45 \u00b0C for 10 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min; followed by 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 45 s.
