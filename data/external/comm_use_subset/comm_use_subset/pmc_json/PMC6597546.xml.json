            "text": "Despite efforts to improve hygiene, infectious diarrhea is responsible for \u223c11% of early childhood deaths1. A recent multicenter study of life threatening diarrhea conducted in the Indian subcontinent and Sub-Saharan Africa found that the little-studied apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium, predominantly either Cryptosporidium parvum or Cryptosporidium hominis, is amongst the two or three most important causes of childhood diarrhea2,3. Cryptosporidiosis is also strongly associated with child malnutrition and developmental stunting4,5. Cryptosporidium parasites were previously best known as a frequent cause of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised people, such as those with AIDS or following organ transplantation, and in the United States they account for more than 85% of waterborne diarrheal disease for which a pathogen is identified6\u20138. Cryptosporidiosis is also a large economic concern for beef and milk producers, and infection of cattle may contribute to contamination of water supplies and human outbreaks9,10. In a nationwide survey of farms in the United States, C. parvum was present on more than 50% of dairy farms, and 48% of all calves aged 1\u20133 weeks were infected9. Despite the public health and economic impacts of Cryptosporidium, there is no preventive vaccine and treatment options for both humans and cattle are limited. The only approved treatment, nitazoxanide, reduces the duration of diarrhea in immunocompetent adults, but is only moderately effective in children and is equivalent to a placebo in immunocompromised patients11\u201313. Its activity in dairy calves is controversial and at best marginal14,15. New anti-Cryptosporidium drugs are urgently needed, and several promising drug leads have been reported recently16\u201319.",

They typically engage with proteins through interaction of an electrophilic boron atom with nucleophilic partner residues (e.g., serine, threonine or tyrosine) or with metal cations (e.g., Zn2+, Mg2+) present in the active site of enzymes, acting as a phosphate mimetic. Potent benzoxaborole inhibitors of bacterial21,22, fungal23, and protozoan24 pathogens have been identified that work by inhibiting various essential microbial enzymes22,23,25\u201328. Tavaborole, a leucyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor, is approved for treatment of onychomycosis, and crisaborole, which targets human phosphodiesterase 4, was recently approved for treatment of atopic dermatitis20,29.",

Given this and the recent identification of benzoxaboroles with potent antimalarial activity28,30,31, we screened a library of benzoxaborole compounds for anticryptosporidial activity. Here, we report identification of a novel drug candidate, AN7973, for treatment of cryptosporidiosis. AN7973 potently inhibits multiple C. parvum isolates and the C. hominis TU502 isolate in vitro, appears to be parasiticidal, has outstanding activity in rodent models of both acute and established infection, and was efficacious against C. parvum in a dairy calf clinical model. Its initial pharmacokinetic (PK), stability, and safety profiles are highly favorable, and indicate its potential as a new drug for treating cryptosporidiosis in all target populations.",

A library of 7802 compounds, including analogs similar to four chemical scaffolds with antiprotozoal activity, was screened in duplicate for inhibition of C. parvum growth within MDCK cells using high content microscopy and adaptation of a previously described screening assay (Fig. 1)32. This screen yielded 403 hits with >70% inhibition at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M. Confirmatory dose-response assays were conducted in triplicate on 400 compounds available for follow-up, and an additional 222 compounds were tested to complete structure activity relationship (SAR) analyses for each scaffold. Further prioritization was then done by conducting a preliminary mouse efficacy study with one compound representative of each chemical scaffold that was selected based on availability of chemical stocks, existing potency and mouse PK data, and the potential to leverage other programs within Anacor\u2019s Neglected Tropical Disease portfolio. AN7973 was selected for further development based on these considerations, and the remaining scaffolds were retained as alternates worthy of revisiting if necessary.",

It predominantly affected intracellular Cryptosporidium development, since it arrested new DNA synthesis as reflected by inhibition of incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) into newly synthesized DNA (Fig. 2c). The relative effects of AN7973 on different life cycle stages were assessed by comparing potency against asexual replication with potency in reducing the percent of parasites expressing the meiotic recombination protein DMC1, which is a biomarker for Cryptosporidium sexual development38. Unlike some compounds, e.g., the piperazine-based lead MMV665917, that have equal potency against asexual and sexual stage parasites38, AN7973 inhibited asexual parasite growth four times more potently than asexual-stage to sexual-stage differentiation (Fig. 2d), which was felt to be consistent with its effect on intracellular replication.",

We therefore used a neonatal calf model to test the effect of AN7973 treatment on diarrhea and dehydration, in addition to its effect on parasite shedding. For this, an initial small efficacy study was conducted during which the effect of infection on PK was also assessed. These data were then used to guide the design of additional dosing regimens (Fig. 5a). One-day-old to two-day-old bull calves were infected by oral administration of \u223c5 \u00d7 107 C. parvum Bunch Grass Farms Iowa isolate oocysts. Fecal parasite shedding was measured daily using qPCR, and the animals were assessed clinically at least twice daily for diarrhea, hydration status, appetite, and overall health status. Clinical observations were quantified using previously described scales ranging from 1 (normal) to 3 (severely abnormal) for fecal consistency, overall health status, hydration status, and appetite (see Supplementary Table 2)43. Finally, the areas under each time course curve (AUC) were calculated to provide an overall measure of the impact of AN7973 on each parameter and facilitate statistical comparison.",

Twice daily 5 mg per kg AN7973 curtailed parasite shedding and completely eliminated diarrhea (Fig. 5b, d and e). Once daily 10 mg per kg AN7973 also reduced peak parasite shedding and diarrhea. However, despite equal or better mean plasma exposures in animals treated with once daily 10 mg per kg vs. twice daily 5 mg per kg AN7973, fecal parasite shedding resumed and persisted in the once daily treated animals (Fig. 5b).

Thus, it may be useful for treatment of all patient populations affected by cryptosporidiosis, including AIDS patients, transplant recipients, and malnourished children. In addition to efficacy in mouse models of both acute and established infection, AN7973 reduced C. parvum fecal shedding, diarrhea, and dehydration in a neonatal calf model in which disease closely mimics that seen in infants. AN7973 also meets many of the stability and safety requirements for a novel anticryptosporidial44, although additional toxicology and PK studies of AN7973 are needed. Note that AN7973 was 3-fold to 4-fold less potent in vitro against the C. hominis TU502 isolate, which highlights the need to test in vivo efficacy of AN7973 against C. hominis.",

Many compounds that do not directly target DNA synthesis (e.g., several tRNA-synthetase inhibitors presumed to inhibit protein synthesis) look similar to AN7973 in this assay38. Recent studies of AN7973 demonstrated that its trypanicidal activity results from inhibition of trypanosome mRNA processing45. Furthermore, related HAT and AAT lead compounds, also 6-amides like AN7973, target Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specific Factor 3 (CPSF3), an endonuclease that functions in mRNA processing46. It is known that other oxaboroles inhibit CPSF3 in Plasmodium falciparum28, and Cryptosporidium CPSF3 is greater than 40% identical to that of P. falciparum at the amino acid level. It therefore seems possible that AN7973 inhibits Cryptosporidium CPSF3 as well.",

Oocysts were induced to excyst by treatment for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C with 10 mM HCl and then 10 min at 15 \u00b0C in 2 mM sodium taurocholate, washed in the above medium with 1% FBS, and then added to cell monolayers in the presence of compounds. The number of oocysts added to each well was dependent on the viability of the parasite stock, and varied between experiments. Compounds were screened at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 48 h, the cells were fixed for at least 24 h by adding an equal volume of 8% formaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were blocked with 0.1% Titron X-100, 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in saline, which was also used for all subsequent steps. Cells were incubated with 0.5 \u00b5g per mL of biotinylated Vicia villosa lectin (VVL, Vector Laboratories, catalog# FL-1231) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, and stained in the dark for 1 h at room temperature in 0.5 \u00b5g per mL Cy3-streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog# 016-160-084) containing 1 nM DAPI [2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamide]. After incubation, the plates were washed three times and 50 \u00b5L per well of the above blocking buffer was added. Plates were stored at 4 \u00b0C in the dark until processed. Images were acquired using a GE InCell 2000 automated microscope, and GE InCell Developer (version 1.9) image analysis software was used to quantify the parasites and host cells. Confirmation by 8-point dose response curve was performed in triplicate, with half-log serial dilutions starting at 10 \u00b5M.",

Before and after each treatment, oocysts were spun down at 14,000 \u00d7 g for 4.5 min and supernatant was removed. Oocysts were then diluted in complete media and added to cells at 5 \u00d7 104 oocysts in 25 \u00b5L per well such that the final concentration of compounds was the same as the indicated concentration. Oocysts were allowed to excyst and sporozoites allowed to invade in presence of indicated compound concentrations for 3 h after which cells were washed three times with PBS containing 111 mM D-galactose, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.25% triton X-100 for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C.

Ricerca performed a Lead Profiling and Adverse Reaction Enzyme panel of 109 off-target enzymes and receptors. This included the hERG K+ ion channel, which is associated with cardiac tachyarrhythmias, and used a radioligand binding competition format with 10 \u00b5M test compound for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C. For the enzyme and receptor panel, competitive inhibition at 10 \u00b5M of test compound was the most common assay format. The AMES bacterial reverse mutation assay detects point mutations in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium as an indicator of mutagenic activity. Bacterial strains were obtained from Molecular Toxicology (Boone, NC). WuXi tested AN7973 against five strains with and without S9 (Aroclor 1254 induced rat liver S9) in triplicate. AN7973 was tested for mutagenic activity at doses ranging up to 5000 \u00b5g per plate. An in vitro micronucleus genotoxicity assay was performed to assess the clastogenic/aneugenic potential of AN7973. WuXi tested AN7973 against human lymphocytes with and without S9 for 3 and 28 h using a range of concentrations from 0.25 to 260 \u00b5g per mL, in duplicate, and observed by microscopy for induction of micronucleated human lymphocytes.",

These studies were reviewed and approved by the WuXI AppTec Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and a staff veterinarian monitored them for animal welfare issues. Animals were individually housed in solid bottom plastic cages with bedding in compliance with the US Animal Welfare Act. All rat studies were performed using \u223c8-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats (Rattus novegicus)/Crl: CD[SD] VAF/Plus weighing between 243.22 and 276.57 g at the start of compound dosing. A 7-day repeated oral dose toxicity study was performed using 5 vehicle (0.5% (w/v) methyl cellulose and 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate in purified water) control and 5 treatment group rats dosed AN7973 80 mg per kg once daily oral gavage for 7 consecutive days. Cage side clinical observations of condition and behavior (i.e., gait, stool, activity level, atonia, coat soiling and grooming, skin turgor, posture, priapism, piloerection) were performed twice daily during the dosing phase, and weights and food consumption were measured daily. At termination, all study animals were evaluated for erythrocyte count, absolute reticulocyte count, alkaline phosphatase, and triglycerides by fasting the animals overnight and obtaining blood from the abdominal aorta at necropsy as a terminal procedure under deep anesthesia (pentobarbital). A complete necropsy and histopathologic studies (hematoxylin and eosin staining) of large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and any gross lesions were performed on all animals on day 7 of dosing. A TK study was performed in parallel to determine exposure, using 3 vehicle control animals and 6 experimental animals dosed 80 mg per kg AN7973 by oral gavage once daily for 7 consecutive days. Serum was collected from vehicle-control animals at 1 h and 4 h after dosing on days 1 and 7. The AN7973 recipient group was divided into two, with serum collected according to the following schedule: first 3 of 6 animals (pre-dose, 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 72 h post dosing on days 1 and 7 (72 h time point day 7 only)); and second 3 of 6 animals (0.5 h, 2 h, 8 h, 48 h post dosing on days 1 and 7 (48 h time point day 7 only)). Following completion of blood collection, TK animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and exsanguination without necropsy. AN7973 was quantified using a qualified liquid chromatographic triple quadruple mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method that had a lower limit of quantification of \u22645 ng per mL.",
