            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus belonging to the Orthohepevirus genus within the Hepeviridae family [1]. Its genome is 7.2 kb in length and codes for three open reading frames (ORF1 to 3) [2]. ORF1 codes for a nonstructural polyprotein composed of several putative functional domains including a methyltransferase (Met), a domain of unknown function (Y), a papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), a macrodomain (X), a helicase and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [3]. It is still unclear whether ORF1 is expressed as a single polyprotein or cleaved to several functional proteins in the context of infection. Multiple studies have suggested that ORF1 is cleaved into several products [4,5,6,7,8], whereas a few others have reported a lack of processing of the viral polyprotein [9,10,11]. The use of different expression systems may explain these conflicting results. Recently, a paper has suggested that ORF1 is cleaved by thrombin and factor Xa [12]. ORF2 and ORF3 code for the capsid protein and a multifunctional phosphoprotein, respectively. Four genotypes infect humans. Genotypes 1 and 2 (HEV-1 and HEV-2) are transmitted via the faecal-oral route, through the consumption of contaminated water or soiled food in endemic regions. In contrast, genotypes 3 and 4 (HEV-3 and HEV-4) are detected in humans and other animal species worldwide and are transmitted via direct contact with infected animals or the consumption of infected meat [13,14]. In most human cases, HEV infection causes an acute hepatitis that is self-limited. However, fulminant hepatic failure can occur in pregnant women in endemic regions (HEV-1 or -2), in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, or in the elderly (HEV-3 or -4). More recently, chronic cases of hepatitis E have been reported in immunocompromised patients (HEV-3 or HEV-4) and extrahepatic manifestations including renal, pancreatic and neurological disorders have been linked to HEV infection [15]. With the exception of China, no country has yet commercialized an HEV vaccine, and no treatment against HEV infection is approved.",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are a group of secreted cytokines that play a key role in the host early antiviral response. Type I IFNs (IFN-I), composed mainly of IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2, are produced directly in response to viral infection, upon the sensing of viral molecular signatures by specialized cellular receptors such as retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). IFN-I subsequently binds to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors (IFNAR) at the cell surface and activates the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (STAT) signalling pathway in an autocrine and paracrine manner. The binding of IFN-I to receptors leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and JAK1 [16,17,18] and the subsequent phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the IFNAR subunits [18,19,20,21,22]. STAT1 and STAT2 are then recruited and phosphorylated by the JAK kinases on tyrosine 701 and tyrosine 690, respectively [18,23]. Phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers are released in the cytoplasm, where they interact with IFN response factor 9 (IRF9) to form IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) factor 3 (ISGF3). This transcription factor translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to specific promoter elements called IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), leading to the upregulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that may display antiviral properties and contribute to the establishment of a rapid and robust antiviral state within the cell [24]. Most cells can produce IFN-I. In contrast, type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) is secreted mainly by activated T cells and natural killer cells. The binding of the cytokine to a specific IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR) leads to the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of STAT1. STAT1 homodimers are then formed and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific promoters to activate the transcription of a different subset of ISGs [25].",

            "text": "Different reports have suggested that an IFN response is triggered by HEV as the expression of IFN-I, and multiple ISGs have been detected after infection in vivo and in vitro [26,27,28,29,30,31]. However, IFN-I seem to have a moderate and delayed antiviral effect on HEV infection in vitro and in patients in comparison, for instance, to the potent effect they exert on the hepatitis C virus (HCV), another hepatotropic RNA virus [32,33]. Consistently, recent studies have indicated that the host ISG response to IFN-I is inhibited during HEV infection [31,32,33,34], but the mechanisms involved in this inhibition remain poorly characterized. As a nonstructural polyprotein, HEV ORF1 contains one or several functional domains able to modulate the IFN-I system. The macrodomain, the PCP domain and the Met domain have been described as antagonists of the signalling cascade leading to IFN synthesis [35,36]. However, nothing is known about the ability of the viral polyprotein to inhibit the response to IFN-I and the JAK/STAT pathway. To address this question, we studied the effect of HEV ORF1 and several of its domains on this signalling pathway. We used a transfected cell model to express full-length or fragments of ORF1 fused to a FLAG tag, as it is difficult to detect the polyprotein and its putative cleavage products in the context of infection or replication [10,37]. We were particularly interested in testing PCP and the macrodomain (X), as such functional domains encoded by several RNA-positive viruses have been shown to modulate the host innate immune response [38,39,40,41,42,43]. The amino-terminal end of ORF1 (MetYPCP) containing Met, Y and PCP was also included in this study as a putative zinc finger domain is present in Met that might be critical for the enzymatic activity of PCP [44]. We found that the MetYPCP domain inhibited ISRE promoter activation and the expression of several ISGs after stimulation with IFN-I. Further investigations revealed that MetYPCP interfered with STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation. Overall, our data provides evidence that the predicted MetYPCP domain of HEV ORF1 antagonises STAT1 activation to modulate the IFN response.",

A strain of HEV-3f was extracted from this sample using QiAmp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with a Primescript reverse transcriptase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). A total of seven overlapping fragments were amplified using the hot start high-fidelity Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or a 5\u2032RACE and 3\u2032RACE kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and cloned into the plasmid pCR2.1. The 7 overlapping fragments were then digested with restriction enzymes and ligated 2 by 2 with the T4 DNA ligase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) to generate a DNA fragment corresponding to the full-length viral genome downstream of a T7 promoter and a unique SwaI restriction site. This fragment was subsequently cloned into a pUC19 vector to generate pUC19-FR-HuFulHEV3f. The complete nucleotide sequence coding for ORF1 was then determined by sequencing and deposited in the GenBank database under accession number MG197988. The position of the different putative functional domains of ORF1 was identified by comparison with a previous computer-based analysis [3]. DNA sequences coding for full-length ORF1 as well as MetYPCP, Y, PCP, X, Met, MetY and YPCP (Figure 1a) were amplified using pUC19-FR-HuFulHEV3f as a template and specific primers (Table 1) by standard PCR using the Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The PCR products were then cloned by in vitro recombination into pDONR207 (Gateway system, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described previously [45]. These coding sequences were subsequently recombined into a translation-optimized pCINeo-3xFLAG expression vector [46] using the Gateway cloning procedure (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).",

            "text": "To assess the ability of the different HEV ORF1 products to interfere with the IFN-I response, we first examined their effect on ISRE promoter activation using a luciferase reporter assay. For this, 293T cells were transfected with an ISRE-reporter plasmid (pISRE-Luc), a control vector (pCMV-Luc) to normalize for transfection and a pCINeo-3xFLAG empty vector or plasmids coding for ORF1, MetYPCP, Y, PCP or X. Cells were treated 40 h later with IFN-\u03b2 for 7 h. As a positive control, cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for the V protein of the Schwarz strain of measles virus (MV-V) fused to a FLAG tag at its amino-terminal. This viral protein inhibits the IFN-I response by interacting with STAT1 and JAK1 and interfering with STAT1 and TYK2 phosphorylation [45]. As shown in Figure 1c and Supplementary Materials Table S1, the expression of MetYPCP was able to inhibit significantly ISRE promoter activation after stimulation with IFN-\u03b2. This inhibition was not due to a cytotoxic effect of the viral protein, as transfection of the construct coding for MetYPCP for 40 h did not affect cell viability (Figure 1d). The MetYPCP inhibitory effect on the ISRE promoter was modest compared to the one of MV-V. This might have been due to the low expression level of MetYPCP in our reporter assay (Supplementary Materials Figure S1). In contrast, no significant inhibition was detected when PCP alone was expressed. It is interesting to note that both MetYPCP and PCP were able to inhibit significantly IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity after stimulation of the RLR pathway in a luciferase reporter assay [49]. This result was in agreement with previous findings showing that PCP from HEV-1 ORF1 was an inhibitor of the RLR pathway [35] and suggested that the PCP domain expressed in our study was functional. ORF1 had no impact on ISRE promoter activation in our assay, but the relatively low expression of full-length ORF1 or a lack of processing of the polyprotein in 293T cells (Figure 1b and Supplementary Materials Figure S1) might have masked a putative inhibitory effect. To determine whether the entire MetYPCP product was necessary to inhibit ISRE promoter activation, we also tested the effect of Met, MetY and YPCP of HEV ORF1 on ISRE promoter activity using the same luciferase reporter assay (Figure 1a\u2013c, Supplementary Materials Figure S1 and Table S1). As shown in Figure 1c, expression of Met alone resulted in a significant increase in ISRE promoter activation, and MetY or YPCP had no effect on ISRE promoter activation. These results suggested that expression of the amino-terminal region of ORF1 containing the Met, Y and PCP domains was necessary to inhibit the signalling pathway triggered by IFN-I.",

First, we assessed the ability of MetYPCP to modulate STAT1 nuclear translocation after IFN-\u03b2 stimulation by immunofluorescence. In the absence of IFN treatment, STAT1 was found predominantly in the cytoplasm of 293T cells transfected with an empty vector or plasmids coding for FLAG-tagged MetYPCP, PCP or MV-V (Figure 3a, upper panels). STAT1 was also found in the nucleus as the transcription factor shuttled between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells [50]. IFN-\u03b2 treatment led to the nuclear accumulation of STAT1 in most of the cells transfected with an empty vector or a plasmid coding for PCP (Figure 3a, lower panels). In contrast, STAT1 remained diffuse in the cytoplasm and nucleus of a proportion of cells expressing MetYPCP and MV-V (Figure 3a, lower panels). We then quantified the number of cells showing predominant nuclear localisation and the number of cells with a cytoplasmic/nuclear localisation of STAT1 upon IFN-\u03b2 stimulation (Figure 3b). A significant decrease in the percentage of cells showing STAT1 nuclear localisation was found in cells expressing MetYPCP (65%) and MV-V (39%) in comparison to cells transfected with the empty plasmid (88%) or expressing PCP (84%), thus suggesting that MetYPCP interfered with STAT1 nuclear translocation. In addition, ORF1, Met, Y and X had no effect on STAT1 nuclear translocation (Supplementary Materials Figure S3), thus corroborating our results from the reporter assay (Figure 1c). Interestingly, MetYPCP localised more frequently in dense structures around the nucleus upon IFN-\u03b2 stimulation. It is possible that the viral protein interacted with a cellular protein whose expression was induced by IFN-\u03b2, leading to a change in its localisation upon stimulation. This difference of localisation was also observed with PCP but was less apparent than for MetYPCP.",

As IFN-I and -II activation triggers different components of the JAK/STAT pathway, these experiments could help pinpoint at which level of the pathway MetYPCP was acting. First, we assessed the effect of MetYPCP expression on STAT1 nuclear translocation after IFN-\u03b3 stimulation by immunofluorescence (Figure 5a and Supplementary Materials Figure S4). IFN-\u03b3 treatment led to the nuclear translocation of STAT1 in around 96% of cells transfected with an empty vector and around 80% of cells expressing MetYPCP (Figure 5a), thus suggesting that MetYPCP was able to inhibit STAT1 translocation in response to IFN-\u03b3. However, this antagonist effect was less pronounced than the one observed after IFN-\u03b2 treatment, for which 68% of cells expressing MetYPCP displayed a predominant localization of STAT1 in the nucleus (Figure 5a). We also assessed the ability of MetYPCP to inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation after IFN-II treatment. Cells expressing MetYPCP were treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 30 min, and the level of phosphorylated STAT1 was quantified by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 5b,c, no significant inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation was detected in cells expressing MetYPCP following IFN-\u03b3 treatment. These results suggested that MetYPCP had a limited impact on the JAK/STAT pathway after IFN-II treatment. Similarly to MetYPCP, MV-V caused a slight decrease of STAT1 translocation (Figure 5a) and did not inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation (Figure 5b,c) after IFN-\u03b3 treatment. These results were in agreement with several studies showing that MV-V was more efficient at antagonizing the response to IFN-I in comparison to IFN-II [51,52,53].",

We found an amino acid sequence identity of 86% between the MetYPCP domains from the HEV-1 and HEV-3 strains cloned in this study (Supplementary Materials Figure S5) and of 69% between the PCP domains. Expression of the ORF1 fragments was then confirmed in 293T cells by immunoblotting (Figure 6a). The effect of the HEV-1 MetYPCP and PCP domains on ISRE promoter activation was then assessed using the luciferase reporter assay described above. As shown in Figure 6b and Supplementary Materials Table S2, MetYPCP from HEV-3, but not HEV-1, was able to inhibit ISRE promoter activation after IFN-\u03b2 treatment. This difference was not due to a problem of expression of HEV-1 MetYPCP, as this domain was more efficiently expressed in 293T cells than HEV-3 MetYPCP and did not impact cell viability (Figure 6a, Supplementary Materials Figures S6 and S7). In agreement with this result, we also found that the expression of MetYPCP from HEV-3, but not HEV-1, inhibited significantly STAT1 nuclear translocation after IFN-\u03b2 stimulation (Figure 6c and Supplementary Materials Figure S8). Altogether, these results suggested that the MetYPCP domain from HEV-1 was not able to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway as efficiently as the one from HEV-3 and that differences in the ability of MetYPCP to interfere with the JAK/STAT pathway existed between HEV genotypes.",

Further investigations revealed that MetYPCP interfered with IFN-\u03b2-induced STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation, thus indicating that MetYPCP targeted the JAK/STAT pathway. Moreover, MetYPCP seemed to act specifically on STAT1 activation, as STAT2 phosphorylation was not affected by the expression of this ORF1 product. STAT1 is a key component of the JAK/STAT pathway that is targeted by a large number of viral proteins, and multiple mechanisms of inhibition have been described [54,60]. Some viral proteins interact directly with STAT1 to block its phosphorylation, while others act as phosphatase to dephosphorylate STAT1 or sequester STAT1 in the cytoplasm or induce its degradation [54,60]. Here, we found that MetYPCP did not affect total levels of STAT1, suggesting that MetYPCP was not able to degrade the cellular protein or affect its expression. However, we found that MetYPCP was able to inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation more efficiently in response to IFN-\u03b2 than to IFN-\u03b3, thus suggesting that MetYPCP interfered more specifically with one or several components or regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway triggered by IFN-I. Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway by type II IFN involves a specific receptor (IFNGR) and the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1, but not TYK2 and STAT2, which are activated by IFN-I only. One can then hypothesize that MetYPCP interferes with the recruitment of STAT1 to the IFNAR subunits or with the phosphorylation of STAT1 by TYK2. MetYPCP could also interfere with cellular proteins involved in the regulation of IFN-I-driven STAT1 phosphorylation. In addition, it is possible that MetYPCP targets several steps of the JAK/STAT pathway and that one target (upstream STAT1 phosphorylation) is specific to the IFN-I response while another (upstream STAT1 translocation) is common to both the IFN-I and -II response. This would explain why we found that MetYPCP inhibited significantly the translocation of STAT1 but not its phosphorylation after IFN-II treatment.",

Surprisingly, in contrast to MetYPCP, expression of Met significantly enhanced ISRE promoter activation. We did not investigate further the mechanism involved in this stimulatory effect. The function of Met might differ depending on whether it is expressed alone or coexpressed with other ORF1 domains. One region of MetYPCP might be needed for its localisation or its catalytic activity while another interacts with specific cellular protein(s). A previous study has reported that a putative zinc-finger domain is present in Met (between amino acids 73 and 94) that might be critical for the enzymatic activity of PCP [44]. Many viral cysteine proteases require a zinc-binding finger motif to be catalytically active or to function as an antagonist of the IFN response. For example, the zinc-finger domain of Nsp1-\u03b1 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is critical for the viral protein to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 synthesis [61]. One can envisage that the enzymatic activity of HEV PCP is dependent on a zinc-finger domain present in Met and is important for the inhibitory action of MetYPCP. This would then explain why MetYPCP was able to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, while PCP alone did not, or did less efficiently. In future work, it would be interesting to assess the inhibitory effect of MetYPCP mutants with a disrupted zinc-binding finger motif to check this hypothesis.",

The amino acid sequence of MetYPCP from genotype 1 is 86% identical to that of MetYPCP from genotype 3 (Supplementary Materials Figure S5). The main differences in the amino acid sequence between the two genotypes are present in the C-terminal part (amino acids 454\u2013592), which corresponds to the PCP domain (433\u2013592). It would then be interesting to construct MetYPCP chimeras carrying the MetY domain from HEV-3 and the PCP domain from HEV-1 and vice versa to determine which part of MetYPCP is responsible for its inhibitory function on the JAK/STAT pathway. In addition, a recent paper has suggested that a factor Xa cleavage site is present at amino acid 560 within the PCP domain of HEV-1 strains but is not present in HEV-3 strains [12].

(c) Effect of full-length ORF1, MetYPCP, Y, PCP, macrodomain (X), Met, MetY and YPCP on ISRE promoter activation: 293T cells were transfected with pISRE-Luc, pCMV-Luc and a pCINeo-3xFLAG empty vector (EV) or a plasmid coding for ORF1, MetYPCP, Y, PCP, X, Met, MetY, YPCP or MV-V. Forty hours later, cells were treated or not (NT) with IFN-\u03b2 for 7 h and lysed to determine firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Mean ratios between firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were calculated and are presented as percentages of the treated EV control (\u00b1 standard deviations). Results shown represent the mean of four independent experiments performed in triplicate. Here, * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.0005 compared to EV control for treated samples (unequal variance t-tests). Raw data are shown in Supplementary Materials Table S1. (d) Cell viability assays at 40 h post-transfection: 293T cells were transfected or not with a pCINeo-3xFLAG empty vector or a plasmid coding for ORF1, MetYPCP, Y, PCP, X, Met, MetY, YPCP or MV-V fused to a 3xFLAG tag. Forty hours after transfection, cells were lysed and cell viability determined using a luminescent-based assay. Luciferase activities (\u00b1 standard deviations) are expressed as percentage relative to nontransfected cells. No significant difference was found between the cells transfected with the pCINeo-3xFLAG empty vector and the one transfected with the plasmid coding for the different FLAG-tagged proteins (unpaired t-tests). Results represent the mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.",
