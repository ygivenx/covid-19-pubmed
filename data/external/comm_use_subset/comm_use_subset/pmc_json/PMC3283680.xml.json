Indeed, the vast majority of previous health system analyses in relation to pandemic influenza have focused on developed countries [1], [3]\u2013[11], while the capacity of health systems in low and middle income countries remains largely unstudied. Paradoxically, understanding outbreak response capacity in low and middle-income countries is arguably of greater importance than that in developed countries, not only because health systems are weaker [12], but also because many of these countries are in regions where the risk of emerging infectious diseases is highest [13]. Moreover, these countries may suffer disproportionately because of associations between morbidity, pandemic influenza and poverty [14].",

Resource gaps for a pandemic response are likely to be wide and vary greatly between and within countries in Asia [20].

These resources, along with over 50 other resource items relating to health system infrastructure, equipment, materials, and human resources, were selected through a systematic literature review and a Delphi consensus process by a panel of 24 experts, as described in [21]. Quantities of these resource items were enumerated during March to September 2009 through questionnaires administered to hospitals and health offices in all districts of each of the six study countries (except Indonesia, where data were collected only from districts in Jakarta and Bali due to the vast geographic scale of the country). Additional questionnaires were sent to ministries of health to capture central stockpiles.",

The response rates for hospital questionnaires were slightly lower at 93% for Indonesia and Vietnam, 70% for Lao PDR, and approximately 46% for Thailand and Taiwan. Data from the questionnaires were double-entered into an Excel database. Missing values, due to non-responses or incomplete questionnaires, were extrapolated using linear prediction models, specific to each country and resource item, based on a number of district characteristics such as total number of hospital beds or public hospital beds, population size, and geographic location (region/province). For oseltamivir and ventilators, two-step models were used to first estimate the likelihood of having any oseltamivir or ventilators, and then to predict the number of these items.

Full details and equations of the model can be found in [22], and are summarized in Text S1. Briefly, the model is based on a deterministic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered/removed) model described by differential equations tracking number of people in each compartment over time. Given that the primary aim of this analysis was to provide relative estimates of resource gaps within and across countries, rather than to accurately simulate the spread of pandemic influenza throughout each country, the model structure was kept relatively simple, with homogeneous mixing patterns and no age-structure assumed within the modeled population. However, novel complexity is incorporated through making parameters describing the clinical course of infected individuals conditional upon the availability of certain key health system resources (antivirals, beds, and ventilators). Thus we could obtain relative indications of the consequences of resource shortages on the pandemic disease burden, specifically in terms of \u201cavoidable deaths\u201d, which we define as deaths that would not have occurred in the presence of sufficient resources.",

A combination of the large population size and shortage of ventilators results in the estimation that, out of the five countries for which nationwide data were collected, Vietnam would have the highest total number of avoidable deaths. However, the results for Jakarta and Bali suggest that Indonesia would have the highest avoidable death toll if the data is extrapolated across the entire population of this country. When standardized by population size, the highest rates of avoidable deaths were estimated in Cambodia and Lao PDR, accounting for over half of all pandemic-associated mortalities in these countries. The median avoidable death rates for these countries were over 15 times higher than that for Taiwan, where a relatively low proportion (median: 7.6%, IQR: 5.5\u201310.7%) of total deaths was estimated to be due to resource gaps. Almost all avoidable deaths in Taiwan were predicted to be due to local shortages of oseltamivir. In all other countries shortages of ventilators were estimated to be the biggest cause of avoidable deaths (Figure 3). In Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam, this result was largely robust to uncertainty surrounding resource effectiveness and spare capacity. For Cambodia and Thailand, however, the uncertainty analysis suggested that gaps in oseltamivir might also be a main cause of avoidable deaths (Figure 3). When adding an additional layer of uncertainty to the model assumptions, by allowing for up to 5% of mild cases to be treated with oseltamivir, the increased shortages of the latter further increased uncertainty surrounding the relative importance of gaps in oseltamivir (Figure S3). Given such uncertainties and the sensitivity of results to model assumptions, the proportion of mortalities that can be attributed to gaps in specific resources should be interpreted with some caution.",

Our estimates of resource gaps and avoidable mortality rates at country level show a clear association with national GDP. This result is consistent with a previous analysis of data from the 1918 influenza pandemic, which found that per capita income explained a large proportion of the variation in mortality across countries during the pandemic period [14]. Moreover, extrapolation of these mortality rates to the 2004 world population suggested that around 96% of deaths from pandemic influenza would occur in developing countries [14].

Indeed, in all countries except Vietnam, we estimated that optimum mobilization of resources across administrative boundaries could save more than 10% of avoidable deaths. While timely mobilization of resources may be possible in Taiwan, with its small geographical size and relatively developed infrastructure, the feasibility of this scenario is questionable in the poorer, and larger, countries of the Mekong region, where it might be prudent to disburse central stockpiles of antiviral drugs to provincial and district health facilities prior to an outbreak.",

A previous analysis similarly suggested that a dire shortage of mechanical ventilators would be a major limiting factor in responding to a pandemic influenza outbreak in the United States [31].

For example, in our baseline scenario we assumed that 12% of hospital capacity, across all provinces and countries, would be available to care for the surge of patients with influenza infections. In reality, surge capacity is likely to vary substantially between and within countries (and over time), but few data on this are available. Robust analytical frameworks are urgently needed to define and measure health system surge capacity in order to inform analyses of resource gaps for emergency response scenarios. The effectiveness of resources such as antiviral drugs, ventilators, and general hospital care for improving the survival rates among severe influenza cases is also surrounded by considerable uncertainty and may vary between settings. Our results show that, even if epidemiological parameters describing transmission and pathogenicity are kept constant, uncertainties in spare capacity and resource effectiveness lead to considerable uncertainties in estimates of avoidable mortalities rates. Nevertheless, the distributions of model outputs from our multivariate uncertainty analysis still showed some significant differences when compared across countries and across resource types (Figures 3 and 5). Furthermore, it seems likely that spare capacity and resource effectiveness would be higher in more resource-rich settings, which would only strengthen the findings of this study in terms of the geographic distribution of resource gaps and avoidable mortalities.",

In reality, heterogeneities in factors such as age-structure, geographic structure, population density, human behavior, and the underlying health of the population are all likely to play a role in transmission dynamics and burden of influenza. A previous modeling analysis, for example, has shown that higher levels of population heterogeneities, such as in age and spatial structuring of contacts, result in lower overall attack rates and peak prevalence for a given basic reproduction number [33]. However, there is a lack of data on such heterogeneities and how they might affect patterns of pandemic progression for our study region. Ongoing studies, such as contact pattern surveys in Asia similar to those undertaken in Europe [34], are attempting to rectify this. Another limitation is that the resource data were collected between May and September 2009, which includes the first wave of the H1N1-2009 pandemic; thus some resource data (particularly for antiviral stockpiles) may be influenced by the time point within this period at which the data were recorded.",
