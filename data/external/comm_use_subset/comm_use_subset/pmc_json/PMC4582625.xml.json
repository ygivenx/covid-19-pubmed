            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious enteric disease of swine characterized by acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss. It was first observed in farm pigs in England in 1971 [1]. The causative agent, PED virus (PEDV), was identified in 1978 [2]. Subsequently, PEDV caused epidemics with pig mortality in European countries until the late 1980s. Thereafter PEDV was more often associated with endemic cases in Europe. In Asia, epidemics with major losses in suckling pigs were first reported in 1982, continuing into the 1990s-2000s [3-5]. Since October 2010, severe PED epizootic outbreaks, affecting pigs of all ages but characterized by high mortality rates among suckling piglets, have been reported in China, causing significant economic losses [6]. In April 2013, PEDV emerged in US swine and spread rapidly throughout the country, leading to the death of 8 million pigs and economic losses between $900 million - $1.8 billion in 2013\u20132014 [7,8].",

In agreement with field observations, the original US PEDV isolates were highly virulent with 100% morbidity and 50-100% mortality in suckling piglets [12]. Intentional exposure of pregnant sows to PEDV via feedback of fecal material or/and the intestinal tracts of infected piglets stimulated maternal immunity and shorted the outbreaks on some farms [8].

In this study, the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) of an original US PEDV, PC22A strain, was determined by using 4-day-old CDCD piglets and was confirmed using conventional suckling pigs.

Treatments with antibiotics (Penicillin (VET one, UK), gentamicin (VET one, UK) and neomycin (MED-PHARMEX, Pomona, CA, USA)), antitoxin (Clostridium antitoxin (Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, St. Joseph)) and probiotics (probios (Chr. Hansen, Menomonie, WI, USA)), as prescribed by the clinician, were performed to prevent opportunistic infections of piglets throughout the experiment. All piglets were randomly allocated into 8 dose-groups (G1-G8) and two mock control groups (Table 1). Each piglet was housed in individual steel cages and the same group of pigs was in cages installed in 3 levels (2\u20134 cages/level) above the floor. The cages were maintained in biological safety level II (BSL2) rooms. Two adjacent dose-groups of pigs were housed in different sides of the same room (5.4 \u00d7 3.0 m2).",

It was used as inoculum (5 log10 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL) to orally challenge a 19-day-old Gn pig. The pig was euthanized at 1 day post-inoculation (dpi) when it had watery diarrhea. The small and large intestinal contents were collected at 1 dpi aspectically, mixed and stored in 1 mL aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C as the virus pool. The infectious and RNA titers of the virus pool were 7.75 log10 PFU/mL and 13 log10 genomic equivalents (GE)/mL, respectively, using plaque assay and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) as reported [13]. For the preparation of inocula for pigs, 1 mL of PC22A virus pool was diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), mixed well, and vortexed. The suspension was centrifuged at 2095 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was collected as the 1:10 (10\u22121) dilution.

In this study, 40% (2/5) of piglets of G6 (with 10\u22128 diluted virus, calculated dose of 0.3 PFU per pig) showed severe diarrhea by 1 dpi.

One limitation of the present study was that the possibility of PEDV airborne transmission could not be excluded completely since no separate air handling system was available for the control group 1 cages and the inoculated group 5 cages. Our results indicated that even low dose PEDV inoculum resulted in high titers (>10 log10GE/mL) of fecal PEDV shedding in piglets. High levels of PEDV in feces from the first breaking pigs may increase the risk of cross-contamination. Two pigs of control group 1 (Table 1) became infected at 24\u201348 hours post-inoculation (hpi) possibly via airborne transmission of PEDV from the inoculated G5 piglets (10\u22127 dose), which were housed on the other side of the same room. Because of this concern, we decided to set the cut-off time point as 24 hpi for determination of the PDD50. Also the additional control piglets were maintained in a separate room and tested negative for PEDV. Piglets (G6-G8) receiving very low doses, calculated <1 PFU, still had diarrhea, but after 1 dpi. Therefore, the actual minimal infectious dose could be lower than 1 PFU. Our data suggest that piglet bioassay is more sensitive to PEDV infection than Vero cells. This may explain why it is so difficult to eliminate PEDV endemic infections from a farm with a history of PEDV outbreaks.",

In this study, dominant clinical signs and microscopic lesions and high fecal viral shedding were observed in PEDV PC22A-inoculated piglets (>1 PFU) within 1 dpi. The VH:CD ratios were less than 2 in the majority of PEDV PC22A-infected CDCD piglets. On the other hand, a longer incubation time (22\u201336 hpi) was reported in prototype PEDV CV777-inoculated, age-matched piglets (104 pig infectious dose/pig) [21,22]. A previous Korean endemic PEDV strain SNUVR971496 induced severe villous atrophy in younger (1-day-old) colostrum-deprived piglets [23]. However, no PEDV antigen or nucleic acid was detected in epithelial cells within the crypts in PEDV SNUVR971496-infected pigs [23]. It was proposed that current US or US-like PEDV outbreaks are more severe than those previously described in Europe and Korea [3]. Our results suggest that the clinical and histopathological features of PEDV PC22A infection are generally comparable or more severe than those reported for historical European or previous endemic Korean PEDV infection in 1- to 3-day-old piglets. However, this speculation needs to be proven by experimental infection of pigs with historical and emerging PEDV strains under the same condition. In agreement with previous studies that PEDV antigens of CV777 [21,22] and the original US PEDV strain [10,12] were detected in crypt cells, we found that infection of crypt cells by PEDV PC22A strain was observed in about 10% (5/53) of CDCD piglets and in one of 12 conventional sucking piglets. In addition, a strong PEDV antigen signal was detected in crypts (Figure 1). The significance of this finding is unknown.",

            "text": "Our published in vitro study showed that anti-PEDV CV777 convalescent serum cross-reacted with US original PEDV PC22A by CCIF assay for IgG antibodies and by viral neutralization assay. However, the antibody titers against homologous PEDV strains were higher than those against heterologous strains [16]. These results are in agreement with the reported genetic variances between classical/historical PEDV strains, including the prototype PEDV CV777, and original US PEDV strains [19]. Similarly, testing of antigenic cross-reactivity between three current Korean field PEDV strains and two vaccine strains (SM98, P5-V) also revealed antigenic variation between field and vaccine PEDV strains [20]. Current Asian (Chinese, Thailand, Japanese, Vietnam and Korean) PEDV pandemic strains have higher genetic similarity to original US PEDV strains than to classical PEDV strains [8]. These results may explain why the vaccines based on classical PEDV strains did not work well in these countries. Alternatively, it is unclear from published studies if the PEDV vaccine strain used induced sufficient lactogenic immunity in the sows to protect their nursing piglets against high challenge doses of virulent PEDV strains. In this study, the two field exposed PEDV-recovered sows F and G were obtained from a farm with a known history of a recent PEDV outbreak and immediate exposure to live virus for 3 continuous days at 73\u201375 days pre-farrowing. It is most likely that these sows were exposed to homologous or genetically similar original US PEDV strains. Since feedback was performed on the farm for 3 continuous days and within 2\u20133 months before farrowing, the sows had lactogenic immunity (documented in Table 2). Therefore, the suckling piglets of sows F and G were most likely protected from PEDV diarrhea after challenge with high doses (1000 and 10 000 PDD50) of virulent PEDV which were 10\u2013100 times higher than the 100 PDD50 that caused 100% diarrhea in piglets derived from PEDV-na\u00efve sow E. The piglets were likely protected by PEDV-specific antibodies detected in the milk of PEDV-recovered sows (Table 2). In addition, no booster antibody response was detected in serum samples of sows F and G, likely because all piglets were protected from disease and only some pigs shed PEDV at low levels after PEDV-inoculation.",
