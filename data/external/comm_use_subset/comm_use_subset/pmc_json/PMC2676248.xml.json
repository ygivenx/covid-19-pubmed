Soon after its first outbreak, the etiological agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus [2-4], and its complete genome sequence was determined [3,5,6]. The identification of SARS-CoV in Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs in live animal markets in Guangdong, China, provided the first clue of an animal-to-human transmission [7,8]. Further studies indicated that civets were unlikely to be the natural reservoir [9]. Instead the detection of different SARS-like-CoVs in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) seemed to suggest that bats might be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and many other closely related coronaviruses [10-13].",

The \u03c9 ratio (dN/dS ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions) can measure the selective pressure at protein level, with \u03c9 = 1, < 1, > 1 indicating neutral selection, negative selection and positive selection, respectively [18,19]. Previous studies have suggested that the S protein of SARS-CoV experienced positive selection during SARS epidemic [20-22]. However, these studies did not find or did not analyze for positive selection among the replicase or accessory proteins, which may be equally important for SARS-CoV's adaptation to a new host. In order to systematically investigate the adaptive evolutionary process of SARS-CoVs, we employed the branch-site model to analyze the selective pressures that may act upon some key SARS-CoV functional proteins involved in virus entry, replication and assembly. Our results suggest that diversified selective forces act upon different proteins and during different epidemic phases.",

            "text": "To test for diversifying selection and to infer codon sites under positive selection, we mainly used CODEML program in the PAML 4.1 software package, which is based on the maximum likelihood algorithm of Yang and coworkers [32]. Three kinds of models (branch-specific, site-specific and branch-site) were employed to detect selective pressure among different branches and at different sites. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to investigate whether the null hypothesis, where no positive selection is allowed, can be rejected against the alternative hypothesis, where positive selection is allowed [32]. The one ratio model (M0) assumes the same \u03c9 ratio for all branches and sites in the phylogeny. The free-ratio (FR) model assumes an independent \u03c9 ratio for each branch in the phylogeny. M0 and FR can be compared using LRT to examine whether \u03c9 ratios are different among lineages. The discrete model (M3) estimates \u03c9 for three classes of codon. Comparing M0 and M3 can test the variability of selective pressure among sites. When evidence for positive selection (\u03c9 > 1) was detected, the na\u00efve empirical Bayes (NEB) method was used to calculate posterior probabilities for site classes. A higher posterior probability suggests strong support for a site to be under positive selection. In brief, the branch-specific model assumes variation among branches, but not among sites; the site-specific model assumes variation of selective pressure among sites, but not among branches. Both models are widely used to investigate selective pressure. However, if adaptive evolution occurs at a few time points and affects a few amino acids, these two models might lack power in detecting positive selection. To overcome this limitation, we also used branch-site model, which assumes that the \u03c9 ratio varies both among sites and among lineages [33,34]. In the branch-site model A (model A), the lineages of interest are set to be foreground, and the other lineages to be background. Selective constrains are assumed to vary across sites both along foreground and background, and a small fraction of sites only vary along foreground lineages. There are 3 \u03c9 ratios for foreground (0 < \u03c90 < 1, \u03c91 = 1, \u03c92 > 1) and 2 \u03c9 ratios for background (0 < \u03c90 < 1, \u03c91 = 1) in branch-site model A. When evidence for positive selection (\u03c9 > 1) was detected, both na\u00efve empirical Bayes and Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) were used to calculate posterior probabilities for site classes. Since NEB does not account for sampling errors, we used the BEB outputs as suggested by Yang [35]. The null model (model A') is same as model A, but \u03c92 = 1 is fixed. Branch-site model tends to be the most powerful of the three tests. In order to investigate the variation of selective pressure in different epidemic periods and hosts, we set each group of SARS-CoVs as foreground in turn to implement branch-site model. However, in such multiple tests, the probability of false rejection of at least one null hypothesis can be high. So we used Bonferroni correction to control the false positive rate, as it has been shown to be powerful when applied to the branch-site test [36]. As to dataset 1 and 3, we applied branch-site model to 6 groups on the tree, and for dataset 2, we applied branch-site model to 5 groups. So we used 0.0083 as the significance level for each branch-site tests in dataset 1 and 3, used 0.01 as the significance level for dataset 2. As indicated previously by Yang [33], these models sometimes fail to converge to maximum likelihood estimates. We thus performed each analysis at least twice using different starting values. Only identical data produced from both runs were considered reliable. All data are available upon request.",

REL method is often the only method that can infer selection from small (5\u201315 sequences) or low divergence alignments and tends to be the most powerful of the three tests. So this method was run using the GTR substitution model on a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree by the Datamonkey web server.

As to the HP03 group, it can be subgrouped into HPEM and HPL in S gene tree, and HPEM and HPML in 3'-end ORF tree. It should be noted that the posterior probabilities for several nodes are low and there are some polytomies. These uncertainties could be due to some sequences in SARS group have high amino acid similarity, especially for replicase and 3'-end ORFs which are more conservative. However, previous studies suggested that the LRTs and qualitative results of ML parameter estimation were rather insensitive to tree topology [35,38-42]. For branch-site model, Bayesian site identification might be affected by tree topology [40]. Remarkably, one isolate (38-HP03L_GD01), which was isolated in the later epidemic phase in 2003, always clustered with the early phase isolates. A possible explanation could be that this patient was infected in the early epidemic phase, which is supported by sequence analysis; this isolate has 29 extra nucleotides between ORF8a and ORF8b, a feature shared among isolates from civets and early phase patients. Another isolate (5-HP03E_HGZ8L1-B), which was isolated in the early epidemic phase, tends to cluster with the middle phase isolates (Fig 2 and 4). This virus may be a transitional virus because it does not have the extra 29 nucleotides like the middle phase isolates.",

            "text": "Recombination and mutation are two important evolutionary mechanisms driving gene diversity and adaptation. Since recombination can affect the detection of positive selection, we first tested for recombination in our datasets [46]. GARD detected no evidence of recombination within the replicase and 3'-end ORFs, while one putative breakpoint in spike protein was detected. Whether there is any recombination among SARS-CoV is still debatable [13,22,47-49]. Previous studies suggested putative recombination only when analysis of SARS-CoV sequences were put together with other coronaviruses [47-49]; however, when analyses were focused solely on SARS-CoV sequences, recombination could not be detected [13,22]. We also tested recombination in SARS group alone for each dataset. No evidence of recombination was detected by GARD. These results might imply that there could be some ancient recombination events occurred between bat SARS-like-CoV and the ancestor of SARS-CoV, which drove the bat SARS-like-CoV adaption to civet and human. Nevertheless, previous studies had revealed that detection of positive selection by LRT method was robust to low levels of recombination (with fewer than three recombination events), and identification of sites under positive selection by the empirical Bayes method appeared to be less affected than the LRT by recombination [46]. Overall, the issue of recombination among RNA viruses is highly controversial because the putative recombination events described were detected only by utilizing computationally-demanding phylogenetic analyses (split decomposition and/or maximum likelihood methods). Therefore, caution should be used when inferring conclusions about putative recombination events that are based only on such analyses. Because viable clonal recombinant viruses have been rarely observed in nature, for natural recombination leading to the transmission of a recombinant strain to be conclusively confirmed, the following prerequisites should be met: (i) the recombinant crossover should be demonstrated in a single PCR amplicon following cloning to ensure it occurs in a single DNA molecule; (ii) the recombination should be demonstrated repeatedly in clonal populations of viable virus (e.g. a plaque harvest or limited endpoint dilution; and (iii) the recombinant should maintain adequate sequence conservation during post-recombination evolution [50].",

            "text": "The S protein is a structural protein of coronavirus. It has a crucial role in the binding of virus to host receptor and subsequent fusion between the viral and host membranes, both processes being important for virus entry into host cell. In the case of several mammalian and avian coronaviruses, the S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2. The former contains receptor attachment sites and the later is involved in the fusion of CoV onto host cell. The S1 subunit, which usually has high divergence, contains a receptor binding domain (RBD); the S2 subunit, which is comparatively more conserved, contains two heptad repeat (HR) domains [51]. Several studies revealed that the S gene of SARS experienced noticeable positive selection during the SARS epidemics, especially in the early and middle phases [20-22]. However, our analyses indicated that the S protein of SARS-CoV underwent a stepwise adaptive process subsequent to its spillover into the civet and human populations. In the BSL group, our analyses suggest that the bat SARS-like-CoVs experienced purifying selection, indicating that the S gene is relatively stable in bats. In palm civet, SARS-CoV experienced strong positive selection as indicated by the results of PCHP04 group. The failure to identify significant positive selection in PC03 group was most likely due to the limited number of sequences available for analyses (only four sequences for PC03 group and two of them have identical S gene sequences). During the early and middle phases of the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic in human population, a small fraction of sites among the S protein were under strong positive selection. In contrast, isolates from the late phase showed no sign of positive selection, implying the S protein became stable again after two stages of adaptive evolution. Our analysis using the HYPHY package accessed through Datamonkey facility also revealed similar evolutionary patterns for the S protein (Table 3). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that SARS-CoVs originated in bats, that the spill over into civets and humans were recent events and that the two SARS epidemics that took place one year apart, were results of independent animal-to-human transmissions [7,20]. The major sequence difference of the S genes between bat SARS-like-CoVs and civet/human SARS-CoVs suggests that there may be other more closely related SARS-CoVs in bats or there may be other unknown intermediate animal host(s) in the transmission of the virus(es) from bats to civets [49].",

            "text": "Among the SARS-CoVs from human and palm civets, numerous sites are identified to be potentially under positive selection (Table 2 and see additional file 3A). Those sites inferred from different SARS epidemic phases reflect the adaptation process of SARS-CoVs. Those sites identified from the PCHP04 group may be important for SARS-CoV adaptation to palm civets. Those sites identified from the HPEM group may be important for SARS-CoV adaptation to human. Most of these sites, especially from the entire SARS group, are located in the S1 domain that contains the receptor binding domain. Zhang et al. [22] previously identified 12 positively selected sites in the SARS-CoV group, all of which were confirmed in our current study. The greater number of sites identified in our study is likely due to the fact that the branch-site model is more powerful than the site-specific model. Some of these sites have been confirmed by experimental data to be crucial for the adaption of SARS-CoVs to human. For example, it has been found that adaptation of S protein to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is facilitated by alteration of residue 479 to asparagine and of 487 to threonine [52,53]. Also, using site-directed mutagenesis, Zhu and Chakraborti identified that residues 344, 392, 426, 431, 479, 480, 487, 488 and 494 are important for the binding of RBD with ACE2 and SARS-CoV antibody [54,55]. In RBD, there are eight newly identified sites (333, 336, 353, 391, 440, 442, 457, 459, and 462) which have not been proved to be critical for RBD and ACE2 interaction. Furthermore, there are ~60 sites to be under positive selection beside RBD. Although evaluation of every observed site under positive selection by reverse genetics would not be realistic or feasible, generation and evaluation of mutant viruses based on sites located within or adjacent to functional domains could provide clues for the genetic aetiology of SARS adaptation to new hosts and emergence.",

            "text": "The first two thirds of coronavirus genome encode two large polyproteins: P1a and P1ab, which are cleaved by virus-encoded proteinases (PLpro and 3CLpro) into 16 non-structure proteins (nsp1\u2013nsp16) playing important role during coronavirus replication. Because the P1ab is too big (~21 kb), we analyzed four most important domains related to viral replication: PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp and Hel, which correspond to nsp3, nsp5, nsp12 and nsp13, respectively [17,43,44]. Our results revealed that, unlike the adaptive evolutionary pattern of S protein, these replicase domains did not experience positive selection in bat and palm civet, but underwent strong positive selection in human patient. Moreover the evidence of positive selection is stronger in the later phases than that observed in the early and middle phases (data no shown). Furthermore, our analysis using HYPHY package observed very weak positive selection in the HP03 group but not among the other groups (Table 3). These results to some extent differ from the observations derived from several previous studies. Using pairwise analysis of the dN/dS, Song et al. found that the average \u03c9 ratio of S protein for the early phase was larger than that for the middle phase, which in turn was larger than the ratio for the late phase. A similar pattern was found in ORF1a and ORF3a but not in ORF1b and nsp3, which were suggested under purifying selection during the whole course of the epidemic. They identified over 200 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and inferred the importance of some SNVs on SARS-CoV adaptive evolution [21]. Zhang et al. also investigated the adaptive evolution of the S protein employing the site specific model, but they did not observe any positive selection in RdRp, Hel or nsp3 [21,22]. The best explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the methods used in their studies were more conservative than the branch-site model used in our study, and hence were not able to detect positively selected changes among the highly conserved genes. Alternatively, it may be due to the use of concatenating analysis in our study, which can provide additional information due to the compiling of more dissimilar sequences for datasets. For the replicase genes of bat and civet isolates, there was no sign of positive selection. This is probably due to the following reasons: 1) the civet isolates were collected within a very short time period and thus there was not enough time for adaptive evolution; 2) civet cells are very suitable for SARS-CoV replication which may imply that the civet is a perfect intermediate host for SARS-CoV; and 3) the bat isolates might have completely adapted to their hosts and hence were under no further selective pressure for evolution.",

            "text": "As to the 3'-end ORFs, the most diversifying selection happened in the middle and late phases of the SARS epidemic in 2003\u20132004. No positive selection was found in the BSL, PC03 and HPEM groups. When the isolates from two epidemics of 2003 and 2004 were investigated together, 12.2% sites in these 7 ORFs were shown to be under positive selection (Table 5). In addition to a few sites identified at p > 90% level, many sites are inferred to be under positive selection at 70\u201380% posterior probability (see additional file 3B). Most of these sites are located in ORF3a, E, M and ORF6, implying these four genes may play a more important role for SARS-CoV adaptation in a new host. Our results based on the REL method showed weak positive selection in HPML group, but not in other groups (Table 3). The failure to identify specific sites under positive selection could be due to weak and thus undetected positive selection. These results suggested that the 3'end-ORFs underwent positive selection after SARS-CoV spilled out into civet and human populations, and adaptive evolution mainly happened in the middle and later phases in 2003. Song et al. previously suggested that the 3a protein evolved adaptively as S protein [21]. By estimating mutation rates, Zhao et al. suggested that the non-synonymous substitution rates were comparatively high in E, M and N [56]. ORF3a encodes a protein of 274 amino acids. A recent study indicated that the 3a protein forms a potassium sensitive channel that may promote virus release and may be important for modulating expression of S on the cell surface [16,57]. 3a protein also interacts with the structural proteins S, E, M [57,58]. Therefore, amino acid changes in 3a protein might be necessary to maintain the interaction between 3a and other proteins. E and M protein play a pivotal role in viral morphogenesis, assembly and budding. Co-expression of E and M was shown to produce virus-like particles, roughly the same size and shape as virions [59]. N protein is important for viral packaging which is the first step in the assembly of infectious SARS viruses [60]. Thus the amino acid changes in these three structural proteins may be critical for virus assembly in the new host. SARS-CoV ORF 6 protein can enhance the virulence of attenuated murine coronavirus (MHV) [61], as well as stimulate cellular DNA synthesis [62]. A recent study showed that ORF 6 protein inhibited both interferon synthesis and signaling [63]. These findings suggested that ORF 6 may have a role in enhancing virus replication or assembly. ORF 7a protein inhibits cellular protein synthesis and blocks cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase, suggesting that 7a may play important roles in the life cycle of SARS-CoV and the pathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV [64,65]. The function of other accessory proteins remains to be determined. Overall, these findings suggest that the 3'-end ORFs play important roles for SARS-CoV replication, assembly and release. Collectively, amino acid changes in these proteins could play a role in modulating the host switch of SARS-CoV.",
