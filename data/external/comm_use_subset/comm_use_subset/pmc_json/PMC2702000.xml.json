In SARS-CoV E the transmembrane domain spans \u223c25 residues [21], approximately from residue 10 to 35. Coronavirus E proteins are incorporated into the virion lipidic envelope, along with the spike protein (S) and the membrane protein (M). While the S protein is involved in fusion with host membranes during entry into cells, and the M protein is important in envelope formation and budding, E protein is not essential for in vitro and in vivo coronavirus replication. However, its absence results in an attenuated virus, as shown for SARS-CoV [22]. Recently, using a transgenic mouse model expressing the SARS-CoV receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), SARS coronavirus lacking gene E was shown to be attenuated and, in contrast to the wild type virus, did not grow in the central nervous system [23]. In other coronaviruses, E protein affects viral morphogenesis, i.e., virus-like particle (VLP) formation and release [24]\u2013[29]. Indeed, mutations in the extramembrane domain of E protein impaired viral assembly and maturation in MHV [30]. In TGEV, the absence of E protein resulted in a blockade of virus trafficking in the secretory pathway and prevention of virus maturation [31],[32].",

The observed paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) of the six isotopically labeled residues in ETM (Fig. 3A) was compared with the PRE calculated from our model according to Protocol S1 (and see Fig. S3). The good fit between observed and expected values validates the proposed orientation of the ETM helices in the \u03b1-helical bundle. This orientation was further confirmed by the observed broadening of the NOESY crosspeaks from aromatic side-chains of F20, F23 and F26 to aliphatic protons of DPC after addition of 3 mM 16-DSA (not shown). Cross-peaks from ETM N- and C-terminal residues, E8-T11 and T35-R38, remained unaffected, indicating that these residues are exposed to the aqueous environment. Consistent with this, we observed broadening of NOESY cross-peaks from E8-L12 and A36-R38 when 1.5 mM of the water soluble paramagnetic probe gadodiamide was added to a fresh sample (not shown).",

In both RDC measurements, a sinusoidal wave of residue periodicity of \u223c3.6 could be observed from residues 19 to 25, consistent with \u03b1-helical periodicity. The RDC of residue L18 could not be fit to this periodicity, due to either deviation from ideal \u03b1-helical geometry or to conformational dynamics. The RDCs were used to determine the alignment tensors of the helix, where one of the tensors coincided with the axis of symmetry of the helical bundle, consistent with the helix forming part of an oligomeric complex, as shown previously by other techniques [38]. Thus, to summarize, the present pentameric \u03b1-helical bundle model was built using (i) NOE constraints, (ii) paramagnetic relaxation data, (iii) the obtained alignment tensor/axis of symmetry from RDCs, and (iv) the known oligomeric size of the ETM \u03b1-helical bundle.",

This figure also shows that a protonated form of HMA at nitrogen-5 is bound to the channel. This form may be stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the side-chain carbonyl of N15 and the guanidinium moiety of R38, resulting in an observable 1HN5 signal at 10.7 ppm (Table S3).

In contrast, at the C-terminal binding site, near R38, the HMA\u2236ETM stoichiometry was 1\u22362 suggesting for this site a rapid (in the chemical shift time scale) exchange between ETM-bound and micelle-bound forms of HMA.

If the channel was poorly selective, the reversal potential would have a value somewhere in between ENa and Ek, whereas no selectivity would produce a reversal potential in the mid point between these values (\u223c\u221210 mV). The observed value of reversal potential at \u223c0 mV (Fig. 7B) indicates low selectivity between sodium and potassium, with perhaps a mild preference for sodium. This is consistent with previous results performed in planar lipid bilayers with synthetic E proteins [35],[36].",

However, to facilitate resonance assignment and to unequivocally identify inter-monomer NOEs, six labeled amino acids were chemically incorporated near the center of the ETM \u03b1-helix. Selection of appropriate specific labels is facilitated by prediction of likely inter-monomer interactions using other lower resolution biophysical techniques. In particular, the model reconstructed here with NMR data is consistent with a model that was derived from the analysis of evolutionary conservation of ETM in coronavirus envelope proteins [40]. The latter approach is data independent, and only relies on the reasonable assumption that all homologues share the same backbone structure [42]. Because by definition conservative mutations that appear during evolution should not destabilize the correct model of transmembrane interaction, but may destabilize incorrect low energy models that appear during the simulations along with the correct model, these mutations act effectively as an in silico filter [43]. The inter-helical orientation obtained for the ETM \u03b1-helices, and their orientation respect to the lumen of the ETM channel and detergent phase, is also in agreement with previous ETM helix rotational orientation measurements obtained by infrared linear dichroism [38].",

The 1H-15N dipolar couplings from the six labeled backbone amides exhibited a periodicity of 3.6, consistent with a canonical \u03b1-helical periodicity, except for L18 which was found to be an outlier, i.e., its 1H-15N vector points in a direction not consistent with the other labeled residues. Additionally, the amide groups of L18 and L19 showed significant line broadening, which was reduced at more elevated temperature likely due to acceleration of the exchange rates. We interpret this as a conformational exchange-induced transverse relaxation at these residues, and we speculate that these conformational dynamics may be required for the channel's function.

In the present work, we observed a very mild preference for sodium over potassium. According to these data, only the apparent selectivity of HMV for sodium appears to be significant. The diameter of naked Na+ is around 2 \u00c5, and that of K+ is 2.66 \u00c5, and the diameter of the ETM pore at the level of N15 (4 to 5 \u00c5) is sufficient to accommodate a single dehydrated Na+ or K+ ion. Hence it may be speculated that N15, or its polar equivalent in other sequences, form a selectivity filter for cations. The equivalent residue to SARS-CoV E N15 in MHV E is Gln (Fig. S7), which has a one methylene longer side chain. This may lead to further occlusion of the channel at this position, and may explain the observed higher selectivity for sodium in MHV E. We also note that the lumen-facing orientation of Asn and Gln may also have a structural role, as these residues are known to stabilize transmembrane interactions [44]\u2013[46].",

Addition of AMT to M2 caused substantial narrowing of 15N spectra [48] and a reduced M2 conformational distribution in a MAS 13C and 15N NMR study [49], both indicative of a more rigid M2 channel in the presence of the drug. The latter studies conform to a model where M2 accesses several conformational states, and AMT would stabilize a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation.

However, the physiological relevance of this activity has only been shown conclusively for M2, a well known pharmacological target that is inhibited by AMT for which a detailed structure is available [53]\u2013[55]. Electrophysiological data, as well as detailed structural information is lacking for most of these proteins. We show in the present work that SARS-CoV E possesses channel activity not only in vitro, but also when expressed in mammalian cells, and we have structurally characterized the homo-pentameric transmembrane domain (ETM) responsible for this activity, when solubilized in DPC micelles in the absence or presence of small drugs.",

The internal solution (pipette solution) contained the following (mM): 135.0 potassium gluconate, 10.0 KCl, 10.0 Hepes buffer, 0.5 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP (pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH; osmolality 275\u2013285 mOsmkg\u22121). The voltages were uncorrected for a \u22129 mV junction potential, and actual voltage is obtained by subtracting 9 mV from the reported values. Whole-cell currents, obtained under voltage clamp with an Axopatch Multiclamp700B amplifier (Axon Instruments), were filtered at 1\u20135 kHz and sampled at 5\u201350 kHz. The access resistance Ra (usually less than 20 M\u2126) and the capacitive transients were not compensated. Stock solutions of amiloride and HMA (Sigma) at 100 mM were prepared in 50% DMSO\u223650% methanol. To determine if the amiloride derivatives blocked SARS-CoV E protein ion channel conductance in HEK-293 cells, after ion channel currents were detected, 10 \u00b5M of the drug diluted in bath solution was applied to the cell.",
