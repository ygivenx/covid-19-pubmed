            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an air-borne infective disease caused by the slowly-replicating bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Person-to-person transmission of Mtb occurs via the respiratory system, which can happen through both close contact between people and through infectious bacilli being carried throughout buildings by air currents [1]. According to the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Global Tuberculosis Report 2013 [2], an estimated 8.6 million new cases of TB and 1.3 million deaths, including 320,000 deaths among HIV-positive people, were recorded in 2012. Approximately 80% of all new TB cases in the world occur in 22 high burden countries that have incidence rates from 59 to 1003 per 100,000 people. India and China have the largest number of cases at 26% and 12% of the global total, respectively. Despite widespread implementation of control measures, including the Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination, antiretroviral therapy, antimicrobial chemotherapy, and the WHO\u2019s short course chemotherapy strategy, TB remains a major cause of illness and death in most high-incidence countries.",

Attributed to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mtb and the spread of HIV/AIDS, the TB burden in China has increased over the past two decades [3]. Meanwhile, according to the United Nations, as a result of the one-child policy and low mortality, China is ageing more rapidly than almost any other country [4]. From the morbidity statistics from 2005 to 2012, shown in Figure 1, we know that the difference in morbidity between different age groups is remarkable: the morbidity of the 0\u201314 age group is the lowest and that of the 60 and older age group is the highest, while the morbidity of the 15\u201359 age group is in between. However, the role of this age grouping pattern in the transmission of TB in China is not yet clear. Therefore, we wanted to identify the potential effect of age on the morbidity for the transmission of TB in China, which could help provide effective control strategies for diverse sub-populations.",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling has become a powerful tool for analyzing epidemiological characteristics [5,6,7,8,9]. Different models have been developed for defining target sub-populations for treating latent TB infections and incorporating certain factors, such as drug-resistant strains, co-infection with HIV, relapse, re-infection, and vaccination, to study the transmission dynamics of TB [7,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. In particular, Blower et al. [10] proposed a simple TB transmission model and presented a theoretical framework for assessing the intrinsic TB transmission dynamics. Bhunuet et al. [14] considered a TB model incorporated the treatment of infectives and chemoprophylaxis. Liu et al. [19] studied a TB model incorporating seasonality. Huynh et al. [24] developed an individual-based computational model to explore the trajectory of the TB burden if the DOTS strategy is maintained or if new interventions are introduced. A more detailed discussion on different TB models was completed by White and Garnett [25]. However, few works have used mathematical models with age groupings to study the transmission of TB in China. In this paper, based on the reported data and the observed morbidity characteristics, we created a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model with age groups of childhood, middle-aged, and senior, to investigate the role of age on the transmission process and evaluate feasible control strategies to reach the goals outlined in the WHO End TB Strategy. We estimated the basic reproduction number R0, analyzed the globally dynamic behavior of the model, and used the model to simulate the annual data of infected TB cases reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) from 2005 to 2016. Finally, we completed uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of R0, and explored some effective and targeted control measures for the transmission of TB in China. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the data collection; formulate the TB model; obtain the theoretical results, such as existence and uniqueness of the solution; and define the basic reproduction ratio R0 and global stability of disease-free equilibrium. In Section 3, data fitting and sensitivity analysis of R0 are shown, and the feasibility of the WHO End TB Strategy is assessed. A brief discussion ensues in Section 4.",

Based on the observation that the morbidity among diverse age groups is significantly different (Figure 1), to explore the role of age on the infection pattern between susceptible and infectious classes, the susceptible class was further divided into three age groups: childhood (S1), middle-aged (S2), and senior (S3). We also assumed that the latent, infectious, and recovered classes are the same for different age groups. Since the latent TB cases, which are individuals who have been infected by TB bacteria but are asymptomatic, and cured TB cases may not directly cause death [26], we assumed that the death rate of the latent and recovered classes were related to the natural death rate d. Additionally, for infectious class, we added the term \u03bc, based on natural death rate d, to describe the deaths caused by TB infection. Our assumptions for the dynamic transmission of TB in China with age groupings are demonstrated in Figure 2.",

To examine the TB controlling effects with respect to \u03b3 and \u03bb3, we examined if reaching the WHO End TB Strategy would be feasible based on the current different control strategies. We used the parameter values listed in Table 2 as a baseline to compare the control effects. First, we only considered the single intervention scenario including \u03bb3, and, as shown in Figure 7a, we would not be able to reach the goal of WHO End TB Strategy under the current plan, even with decreasing \u03bb3 by 50%. Then, we considered the single intervention scenario of \u03b3, and as shown in Figure 7b, 15% increasing of the baseline \u03b3 would allow us to reach the WHO target. Finally, we considered an integrated control strategy including both \u03b3 and \u03bb3 simultaneously. Figure 7c shows that if we can reduce the morbidity in the senior group \u03bb3 by 15%, and increase the recovery rate \u03b3 by 10%, then we will meet the TB End Target. Therefore, we concluded that, by using the current TB control interventions, China may not reach the WHO End TB Strategy in 2025. To achieve the WHO End TB Strategy goal, China will need to pay more attention to enhance their combination TB interventions and further explore the feasibility of additional control strategies.",

Importantly, significant differences exist among different age groups in terms of the morbidity of TB. Taking this into account, and using the reported TB data in China from 2005 to 2016, we proposed a SEIR epidemic model with three age groups, children, middle-aged, and senior, to study the transmission of tuberculosis in China. By means of the Least Square method, we evaluated the parameters and simulated the model, and the model agrees well with the annual reported TB data in China. Furthermore, we calculated the basic reproduction number R0\u22481.7858, and obtain the 95% confidence interval for R0 is about (1.7752,1.7963) by Latin hypercube sampling. We also assessed the feasibility of reaching the WHO End TB Strategy goal under current China TB control initiatives by using a sensitivity analysis of R0 in terms of the parameters.",

Based on the age-structuring model, more risk factors for different age groups can be identified. Interventions could be targeted toward specific groups, which would be particularly effective as an epidemic control measure [38]. Thus, the age grouping pattern provides a meaningful scheme, based upon the treatment of active cases and the chemoprophylaxis of latently infected individuals, to define targeted sub-populations for treating TB infections. For instance, the BCG vaccine is useful only for younger people but is less effective for the middle- or the senior-aged groups, having an average efficacy of only about 50% for those groups [2,39]. However, with the aging of the Chinese population and high morbidity rate of TB in seniors, perhaps an analogue of the BCG vaccine control strategy should be implemented for the potentially high-risk senior sub-population, which may result in the decreasing the morbidity in that group. In addition, the nationwide DOTS program should be more focused on the senior-aged group, such as providing more financial assistance for this group, who may experience catastrophic costs due to TB [26], and should place more emphasis on the people with latent TB in middle-aged group, who may increase the proportion of the actively infected people in the senior group.",

Although the WHO\u2019s target treatment levels may not lead to eradication, these non-eradication treatment levels could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality [11]. Thus, two important indexes must be improved: First, the TB treatment success rate and treatment coverage (increasing \u03b3), for example, by providing high-quality TB care to prevent suffering and death from TB. Second, monitoring and detecting the latent TB in the senior population (reducing \u03bb3) may help prevent the development of active TB in those already infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including further strengthening the public health facilities and providing an isolation policy for those with detected latent TB. For TB infection in children, contact tracing is one of the key components of TB prevention, so educational programming and campaigning can be aimed the youngest age group.",

[5]. Due to the influence of drug-resistant strains, co-infection with other diseases including HIV, diabetes mellitus, etc., and increasing infection opportunities that accompanies world travel, TB will be weakly persistent and should show an overall decreasing trend in the future (see Figure 7). shows that if we can reduce the morbidity of the senior group by 15%, and increase the recovery rate by 10% , then we could potentially achieve the WHO TB End Target. Similar to Wang et al. [31] pointed out, China is not on track, nor does it appear to be currently possible, to reach the required reduction in prevalence.
