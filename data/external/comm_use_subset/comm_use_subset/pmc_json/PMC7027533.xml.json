Various types of vaccines have been developed to eradicate infectious diseases that once killed millions of people: the live\u2010attenuated vaccines (weakened or altered), inactivated vaccines (toxins generated by the bacteria, and not the bacteria themselves) and subunit and conjugate vaccines (segments of the pathogen).1, 2 Currently, more than eighty vaccines have been licensed for use in the United States (more than 15 viral vaccines are also FDA approved) and several vaccine candidates are in the development pipeline3, 4 (https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm093833.htm). Efforts are ongoing to not only improve existing vaccines but to develop novel vaccines targeting infectious diseases with a high unmet medical need. The global public health community's goal is to develop preventative and therapeutic vaccines for major diseases targets such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile, Lyme disease, Lassa fever, Yellow fever, Nipah virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and Dengue fever.5, 6, 7, 8 Unfortunately, despite the increased understanding of immunology and greater insight into the viruses responsible for these infections, limited success has been achieved towards development of vaccines for these epidemics.",

Although MS is not without limitations, some of the misconceptions relating to reproducibility and validation are overstated. To implement a method in the QC environment, the method has to be validated to demonstrate the method's accuracy, precision, intermediate precision, specificity, linearity, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation. Furthermore, appropriate system suitability controls or calibrators are part of the method to ensure repeatability. All of these parameters and controls ensure that during the performance of the assay, no variability between different instruments and operators arises. Unfortunately, some aspect of these validation activities are inherently challenging for a MS\u2010based method. Thus, the burden of proof lies with the vaccine developer to convince a regulator that the MS\u2010based method is a phase appropriate release test without regulatory guidelines applicable to this class of drugs. It is clear from the author's perspective that classical validation regulations as stated in the ICH guidelines are unsuitable for MS\u2010based methods. In the last decade, some of the conventional gel\u2010based or plate\u2010based release assays have been replaced by HPLC or capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods in the QC environment. These HPLC\u2010 or CE\u2010based assays are used to monitor aggregation, fragmentation, clipping, and for content determination. As the application of MS in the vaccine QC environment is an evolving story, the challenge of convincing regulators should be directed toward highlighting MS capabilities as has been shown in the multiple examples in this manuscript. For those working in this field, it will be important to present MS data testing multiple quality attributes of the sample in the same analytical run in combination with HPLC/CE methods or by performing MS analysis to validate simpler HP/UPLC assays used to assess batch to batch consistency. In this way, comparative data sets could demonstrate what the authors believe is the ultimate utility of MS\u2010based methods for QC release of vaccines. The main rational for the MS\u2010based methods in the QC/cGMP environment should not be to replace the existing methods. Rather, it should be a supplemental batch release test to ensure that the product is within specifications and without any unwarranted modifications. Using MS techniques will ensure improved quality and increased safety for clinical trial participants.",
