            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus was the first CoV isolated in 1930. Different CoVs were subsequently isolated in infected rodents and domestic animals, including mouse, pig, cow, turkey, cats, and dogs. CoVs were once believed not to cause human disease, but this was changed after the successful isolation of HCoV strain B814 from the clinical specimen of patients with common cold by serial passage of inoculum in tracheal organ culture in 1962 [2]. In the 1960s, several novel HCoVs were described but no further characterization was performed in most cases [3,4]. 229E and OC43 were known as causative agents of the common cold and upper respiratory tract infection, accounting for up to 30% of cases with common cold [4]. 229E is a prototype strain isolated using tracheal organ culture. OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brain of suckling mice. The clinical features of 229E and OC43 infection were characterized in human volunteer study [4]. In most cases, natural infection with HCoVs results in mild common cold-like symptoms. Severe lower respiratory tract infection develops only in immunocompromised patients [5]. Apart from a respiratory infection, 229E and OC43 were suspected to infect the central nervous system (CNS) as mRNA and CoV-like particles were detected in CNS samples of patients with multiple sclerosis. This claim was further supported by the susceptibility of human neural primary culture to 229E and OC43 [6]. However, the influence of 229E and OC43 on the development and progression of multiple sclerosis awaits further investigations.",

The first reported case of SARS-CoV infection was retrospectively dated back to November 2002 in Guangdong Province of China. In the subsequent seven months, the SARS epidemic resulted in over 8000 reported cases in 37 countries with a case fatality of 9.6% [7]. The superspreading events in SARS-CoV transmission caused fears in the society. Although the exact cause of superspreading remains to be understood, the host but not the virus only is thought to play a key role in the release of large amounts of virions in superspreading. In this regard, the use of immunosuppressive agents such as high-dose steroid in an early phase of viral infection as a treatment modality might boost viral replication leading to the shedding of large amounts of virus. Likewise, the immunocompromised status of the superspreader could have the same effect. In addition, mutation of virus susceptibility genes encoding restriction factors implicated in host antiviral defence would also result in the shedding of extraordinarily large quantities of the virus [8]. In other words, compromising host antiviral defence or decoupling host antiviral immune response from viral replication might allow or facilitate superspreading.",

Unlike 229E and OC43, SARS-CoV infection causes lower respiratory tract infection, accompanied by a cytokine storm in patients with poor outcome. Life-threatening ARDS was developed in some critically ill patients. Apart from a respiratory infection, gastrointestinal and CNS infection was also found in some patients with SARS [10,11]. FRHK4 and Vero-E6 cells played an important role in the discovery of SARS-CoV [9]. The same as chicken embryos in which other CoVs including avian infectious bronchitis virus were isolated and cultured, these cells are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection because they are type I interferon-defective [12]. Consistent with this, infection of STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice with SARS-CoV resulted in a lethal outcome with a profibrotic phenotype in the lung [13]. These mice cannot clear the virus. All these highlight the importance of host antiviral response in the control of SARS-CoV infection at the cellular and organismal level.",

The search was fruitful and two new HCoVs were identified in human samples positive for HCoV but not for SARS-CoV. NL63 and HKU1 were first isolated from a child suffering from bronchiolitis and a patient with pneumonia, respectively [14,15]. HKU1 is difficult to culture and can only be propagated in primary human airway epithelial cells cultured at the air\u2013liquid interface. Similar to 229E and OC43, NL63 and HKU1 were found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases. Particularly, NL63 infection was associated with virus-induced croup in children [16]. All these four viruses are community-acquired HCoVs that are well adapted to humans. Only in rare cases, they might be accidentally mutated to cause more severe lower respiratory tract disease. For example, a subtype of NL63 was recently found to be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection in China [17].",

One relatively big secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015. Up to January 2020, >2500 laboratory-confirmed case were reported with a case fatality of 34.4%. Clinical symptoms were diverse in MERS patients, ranging from asymptomatic to ARDS [19]. Acute renal injury was unique in MERS patients, but it is more commonly observed in the Middle East than in South Korea. MERS-CoV replicates well in many different types of cells and extrapulmonary tissues including the kidney and intestinal tract [20,21].

Error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase creates diversity in the CoV genome, enabling them to jump across the species barrier. However, HCoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) that plays a crucial role in RNA synthesis and replication fidelity [22]. This serves to reduce errors in RNA replication. The inactivation of ExoN causes a mutator phenotype and the resultant virus is either attenuated or inviable. In addition, other structural and non-structural genes might also contribute to the genomic diversity of CoVs by modulating polymerase and ExoN activity [23]. In addition to mutations, recombination and deletion also play an important role in host switching and adaptation. Among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, a mutation rate as high as 0.80\u20132.38 \u00d7 10\u22123 nucleotide substation per base per year has been documented for SARS-CoV [24]. This is comparable to those of primate lentiviruses, including HIVs. Compared to SARS-CoV, the variabilities in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genomes are much less dramatic. It will be of interest to clarify how this might relate to their host adaptability. In this regard, adaptive mutations in the S protein of SARS-CoV have been found during the outbreak to result in better binding with the ACE2 receptor. Cryo-EM analysis has provided structural evidence that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2 with higher affinity. It will be of interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might be further adapted to ACE2 in the near future. Since the receptor-binding domain also contains predominant neutralizing epitopes, variations in this domain are only relevant to the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [25].",

Intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs were also found in domestic and wild mammals. Ancestors of OC43 were identified in domestic animals such as cattle and swine. The switch of hosts from cattle or pigs to humans might have occurred in the context of a pandemic of respiratory disease recorded around 1890 in human history [26]. Similar to MERS-CoV, 229E could be acquired by humans from dromedary camels. However, the direction of this cross-species transmission remains to be determined and the possibility cannot be excluded that both humans and camels might have acquired 229E from an unidentified host including bats [27].",

Palm civets were once thought to be the natural host of SARS-CoV as anti-SARS-CoV antibody was detected in civets in the market. In experimental infection, civets were equally susceptible to SARS-CoV and SARS-rCoV. Infected animals displayed clinical symptoms. However, no anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected in any wild or farmed civets [29], raising the possibility that they are not a natural host of SARS-CoV and SARS-rCoVs. In 2005, horseshoe bats were identified as a natural host of SARS-rCoVs [30,31]. These bat SARS-rCoVs serve as the gene pool and an evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV. It is particularly noteworthy that a SARS-rCoV using the same ACE2 receptor as SARS-CoV was also found in bats [32]. Their genomes share 95% nucleotide sequence homology. Presumably, palm civets and other mammals in the market were transiently infected, and they transmitted the virus to humans. It remains to be clarified whether another stable and natural reservoir host of SARS-CoV, exactly like dromedary camels for MERS-CoV, might exist.",

These camels are the natural reservoir host of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoVs isolated from dromedaries are identical to those found in humans. Experimental infection of dromedary camels with MERS-CoV results in mild disease, shedding large quantities of the virus from the upper respiratory tract [33]. In addition, other non-camelid domestic animals in close contact with infected camels, including sheep, goats, a cow, and donkeys, are also infected by MERS-CoV [34]. These domestic animals could also pose a risk to humans and should, therefore, be included in the MERS-CoV surveillance programme.",

SARS-CoV-2 was detected from the working environment of the market, supporting the existence of a live animal source. Bamboo rats in the family of Rhizomyidae and civets are the prime suspects of an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, although no concrete evidence is available. Metagenomic analysis of CoV sequences indicates that pangolins, which are a group of endangered small mammals, carry betacoronaviruses at a high rate [37], including some sharing \u223c90% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2. The pangolin betacoronaviruses are phylogenetically related to both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. Existing evidence suggests that neither RaTG13 nor pangolin betacoronaviruses might be the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2. Further investigations are required to determine whether pangolins and other animals might harbour parental viruses of SARS-CoV-2 and serve as its intermediate and amplifying host.",

            "text": "CoV-infected bats are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms suggesting that CoVs and bats are mutually adapted to high degrees [38]. Particularly, bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically. First, a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity may suppress CoV replication in bats to a manageable level. Second, degeneration of inflammatory sensors and NF-\u03baB signalling pathway in bats attenuates virus-induced pathology [39]. Particularly, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is defective in bats [40]. Third, constitutively active type I and III interferon production and innate immune response suppress viral replication through the persistent expression of interferon-stimulated genes [41]. It has been speculated that endogenous retroviruses in bats help to sustain interferon stimulation in bats. On the other hand, STING signalling is defective in bats and this might lead to selective repression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes [42]. Finally, upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules in bats may hinder natural killer cell activity [43]. All these unique features empower bats to survive CoV infection and to co-exist with a large number of bat CoVs. Moreover, a high metabolic rate in bats may provide the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains. High ROS level in bats is mutagenic by affecting proofreading of CoV polymerase [38]. More pathogenic CoV strains may be generated by recombination, leading to the acquirement of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation. Bats have an average life span of >25 years [38]. The long life span and the possible establishment of persistent virus infection in bats increase the chance for cross-species transmission of bat CoVs [38].",

Second, infection of their reservoir hosts with parental viruses of HIVs and SARS-CoV-2 results in no or mild symptoms. However, when they infect humans, much more severe symptoms are developed. Third, the similarities and differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 resemble those between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Multiple other transmission events of SIVs from chimpanzees to humans were also detected, but their resulting HIV-1 viruses in groups N, O and P spread in humans only to a limited extent [44]. Group O was found in a few tens of thousands of people in West-Central Africa. Groups N and P were identified in 13 and 2 individuals, respectively. Likewise, appreciable spreading of HIV-2 within humans is seen only with groups A and B resulting from two cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys in West Africa [44]. All other groups (C\u2013H) were found only in single individuals. Thus, both HIV-1 and HIV-2 originated from one or two primate-to-human transmission events.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 share 40\u201360% nucleotide sequence homology. The transmission rate of HIV-2 is lower because the viral load is generally lower in infected individuals. The natural history of HIV-2 infection is quite different from that of HIV-1. Although clinical symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV-1 and HIV-2 are indistinguishable, most people infected with HIV-2 do not progress to AIDS. One strong predictor of disease progression that distinguishes pathogenic HIV infection and non-pathogenic SIV infection is the activation of host antiviral defence including a prominent stimulation of T cells in the former but not the latter. Another possibility is that the natural hosts of SIVs might be the survivors of ancient SIV pandemics. One prediction is that HIVs and humans will eventually adapt to each other just like SIVs and their natural hosts. In this regard, AIDS might be considered an accident in which HIVs fail to adapt to humans or humans fail to adapt to HIVs. In support of this view, species-specific features in host restriction factors, such as TRIM5\u03b1 and tetherin, can prevent SIV infection of humans. On the other hand, adaptive mutations and accessory genes such as Vpu, Nef, and Vif in HIVs have been found to counteract host restriction factors, which constitute the antiviral defence, in a host-specific manner. For example, a five-codon deletion in the cytoplasmic domain of human restriction factor tetherin results in the prevention of its interaction with SIVcpz Nef in humans [45]. On the side of the virus, some HIV-1 strains use their Vpu protein to degrade tetherin [45].",

It also remains to be determined what percentage of the general population in Wuhan have been or are being infected by SARS-CoV-2. These are important research questions that should be set as priority. However, as seen in HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-3, and HTLV-4, not every animal-to-human transmission event gives rise to a virus that is highly and sustainably transmissible within humans. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be stopped due to the intrinsic characteristics of the virus, the action of human restriction factors, and human intervention measures. Another possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 becomes highly transmissible within humans just like the other four community-acquired HCoVs. Some estimates of the transmission rate expressed as reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 fall within the range of 3\u20134, which is higher than that of SARS-CoV (Table 1). If that can be sustained, SARS-CoV-2 will be well adapted to humans ultimately. It will be fortunate if it also becomes less pathogenic, resembling 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63. Plausibly, when they initially crossed species barriers to infect humans decades or centuries ago, 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63 might have also caused pandemics in which humans were suffering from more severe respiratory diseases. As mentioned above, one such pandemic recorded at the end of nineteenth century has now been linked to the jumping of OC43 from cattle to humans [26].\n",

Overemphasizing the differences in the initial stage of the outbreak has turned out to be counterproductive and very costly in disease control. The sequence similarities predict that the patterns and modes of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence would be similar. Indeed, they share many features during the course of infection. First, they share the same cellular receptor ACE2 [35]. Second, their transmission routes and patterns are very similar. While both are transmitted through droplets primarily, close contact is a major risk factor. The attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 within the family context is even higher than that of SARS-CoV [36,51]. The faecal\u2013oral route for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported as in the case of SARS-CoV. More studies are required to elucidate the exact role of faecal\u2013oral transmission in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Third, superspreading events have been documented for SARS-CoV [52] and are also suspected to have occurred in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which could explain the rapid increase in confirmed cases in many places including 691 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship as of 23 February 2020. Fourth, clinical presentations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar, although symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are generally milder. Fifth, host antiviral defence plays a critical role in the course of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. For severe cases, immunopathogenesis and induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm are the culprit. Finally, drugs tested effective for SARS-CoV have been shown to exhibit an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect; examples include nucleotide analogue Remdesivir [53], protease inhibitors Lopinavir and Ritonavir, as well as interferon \u03b12a. Particularly, activation of innate antiviral response by interferon \u03b12a should have beneficial effects at least in the initial stage of infection. However, cautions should still be observed and the possibility that interferon \u03b12a might exacerbate inflammation during the late phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be excluded. Other innate immune stimulators should also be tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in future in vitro and in vivo experiments.",

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an asymptomatic carrier to close contacts was later suggested, but this has subsequently been challenged. However, even if family members and close contacts could be infected by the index patient in the presymptomatic window period as claimed, it is still worthy of a significant concern. Presumed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an asymptomatic carrier to family members has recently been documented [54]. The existence of many asymptomatic carriers, presymptomatic patients, and patients with very mild symptoms posts a huge challenge to infection control, as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from these people to susceptible groups would be difficult to prevent. The number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be underestimated. However, existing evidence suggests that the risk might probably be lower than expected. First, asymptomatic carriers are not common. In the first family cluster that was carefully studied, only one of the six family members was found to be asymptomatic or present with non-specific and mild symptoms with the typical ground-glass opacities in only one but not both lungs [51]. Second, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients could be even less common, if their viral loads are low and virus shedding is not substantial. The key questions concern how often asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding might occur as well as whether their viral loads could be high.",

Importantly, the detection rate of the virus in this group was lower and viral loads were much lower compared to patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms [55]. This is generally consistent with the notion that asymptomatic or presymptomatic shedding of SARS-CoV-2 might be less common than some estimates such as half to half. In this regard, epidemiological studies to determine the percentages of asymptomatic carriers and in selected large cohorts of subjects in Wuhan should help clarify the role of asymptomatic virus shedding in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This analysis will also rule in or rule out our prediction that asymptomatic virus shedding exists but is uncommon. Since patients with non-specific and mild symptoms as well as asymptomatic carriers can go undetected easily, the chance that SARS-CoV-2 will be established in humans is increased. It will likely become either endemic in some regions or pandemic.",

When the immune response effectively limits but could not completely block SARS-CoV-2 replication, asymptomatic shedding might occur. In this scenario, the risk of transmitting to others is relatively low because of a low viral load. Alternatively, if the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is decoupled from viral replication as in the infection of natural primate hosts with SIVs, the viral load would be higher, posing a higher risk for person-to-person transmission.

Although NL63 and HKU1 of low pathogenicity were isolated in the post-SARS era, their time of emergence was earlier than the other two highly pathogenic viruses. Whereas NL63 emerged >500 years ago [57], the origin of HKU1 dated back to the 1950s. In other words, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV represent newcomers that are striving to adapt to humans, whereas other community-acquired HCoVs including NL63 and HKU1 are better adapted.

The use of interferon to treat HCoV-infected patients was tested as early as the 1960s, when various volunteer experiments were performed to investigate how humans combat HCoV infection. Administration of interferon ameliorated the severity of symptoms in 229E-challenged volunteers [58], suggesting that interferon confers protection against 229E infection. Indeed, 229E potently induces type I interferon and its replication is susceptible to inhibition by type I IFN [59], suggesting that interferon serves as a key component of host antiviral defence. Since interferon effectively suppresses the early phase of viral replication, the suppression of interferon production and signalling by highly pathogenic HCoVs can exacerbate disease progression. Thus, highly pathogenic HCoVs adopt various countermeasures to suppress host interferon production and signalling as reviewed elsewhere [49].",

Oligomerization of adaptor protein MAVS is induced by the activation of RNA sensor, leading to the formation of TRAF3-TANK-TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex, which phosphorylates transcription factor IRF3 and drives type I IFN transcription [49]. Highly pathogenic HCoVs often encode viral proteins with a higher capability to antagonize RNA-induced type I interferon production through perturbation of RNA sensing. For one example, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domain of MERS-CoV ORF4a is responsible for the suppression of Sendai virus- or poly (I:C)-induced type I interferon production [60]. The gain of dsRNA-binding ability is observed in bat CoV HKU5 but not HKU4, suggesting that the functional gain of MERS-CoV ORF4a and HKU5 ORF4a might be acquired at a later stage in evolution [60]. For another example, only M proteins from highly pathogenic CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were reported to potently suppress type I interferon production [61,62], suggesting that the loss of this activity might have taken place during viral evolution, leading to attenuation.",

            "text": "Apart from preventing interferon production, CoV proteins have also evolved to suppress interferon effector signalling. One of the best-characterized examples is the oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. Upon activation by interferon in response to the sensing of dsRNA, transcription and expression of OAS are induced to catalyse 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate (2\u2032-5\u2032A) synthesis [65]. 2\u2032-5\u2032A serves as a second messenger, which activates RNase L and limits viral replication through the cleavage of cellular and viral single-stranded RNA [65]. The cleaved RNA fragments, in turn, prime RNA sensors to amplify interferon production in infected cells. To counter RNase L activity, some CoVs have evolved phosphodiesterases which cleave 2\u2032-5\u2032A [66]. The first CoV phosphodiesterase identified is NS2a in mouse hepatitis virus. From protein sequence alignment, multiple CoVs including NS2a from OC43 and a bat CoV, as well as ORF4b encoded by MERS-CoV, are very similar to NS2a of mouse hepatitis virus. All these viral proteins preserve a phosphodiesterase activity [67]. This suggests that some CoVs have developed an important enzymatic activity through convergence and divergence. Hence, although most HCoVs retain one or another strategy to counter host antiviral defence, the highly pathogenic CoVs are particularly powerful in the suppression of host immunity. These capabilities might be weakened or lost when they adapt to humans.",

            "text": "One form of cell death known as pyroptosis is one of the results of a proinflammatory cytokine storm, which drives at least in part the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Poor outcomes of patients with SARS and MERS are often associated with exceedingly high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract and other tissues [71]. The upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2, was observed in SARS-CoV-infected monocyte-derived human dendritic cells and tissue models [72]. Maturation of IL-1\u03b2 is generated through proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 by caspase 1, the activation of which requires the formation of a multiprotein complex termed inflammasome. When danger signals are sensed in the cells, NLRP3 is activated to recruit ASC and facilitate its oligomerization. For full activation of inflammasome activity, two signals that, respectively, stimulate pro-IL-1\u03b2 transcription (signal 1) and cleave pro-IL-1\u03b2 (signal 2) are required. Recombinant SARS-CoVs with either deletion of ORF3a or defective ion channel activity of E protein are compromised in the activation of IL-1\u03b2 maturation and secretion [73,74]. Mechanistically, both ORF3a and E can activate both signals. Both stimulates NF-\u03baB activation, resulting in the activation of pro-IL-1\u03b2 transcription [73,75]. In particular, ORF3a achieves this through TRAF3-dependent ubiquitination of p105 [73]. For the activation of the second signal, ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E protein promotes assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome [76]. Different mechanisms have been suggested for SARS-CoV ORF3a-mediated inflammasome activation. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV ORF3a promotes NLRP3 inflammasome assembly through TRAF3-dependent K63 ubiquitination of ASC [73]. Alternatively, SARS-CoV ORF3a might provide a potassium flux through its ion channel domain to activate NEK7-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome [77]. Further investigations are required to resolve the discrepancies (Figure 2). Nevertheless, enhanced secretion of IL-1\u03b2 mediated by SARS-CoV E and ORF3a proteins might contribute to the induction of proinflammatory cytokine storm since IL-1\u03b2 further promotes the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 and IL-6 [74,75]. Thus, small-molecule inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasomes such as MCC950 and INF58 might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19. This merits further preclinical and clinical studies.\n",

Apoptosis was detected in various HCoV-infected samples derived from not only the respiratory tract, but also extrapulmonary sites. Autopsy studies on SARS casualties revealed massive apoptosis in multiple organs including the liver and thyroid gland [78]. MERS-CoV induces apoptosis in the kidney, lung, and primary T lymphocytes, plausibly through induction of Smad7 and FGF2 [21]. To delineate how CoVs might activate apoptosis, pathway analysis was performed with CoV proteins. ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF7a, ORF8a, ORF9b, and E proteins of SARS-CoV are pro-apoptotic [79]. SARS-CoV ORF7a protein activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through an interaction with anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby sequestering a key suppressor of apoptosis. MERS-CoV infection activates both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis, exacerbating viral pathogenesis [21]. Other than apoptosis, SARS-CoV induces RIP3-mediated necrosis through induction of ORF3a oligomerization [80]. Generally, highly pathogenic HCoVs are capable of activating different cell death programmes more efficiently. In this regard, it will be of great interest to see whether and how the lower pathogenicity and higher human-to-human transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be linked to its abilities to modulate inflammasome activation and cell death programmes selectively.",

Whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within humans will come to a dead end depends primarily on whether the virus has acquired the ability to transmit from person-to-person efficiently and sustainably. In the cases of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, secondary and tertiary spreading becomes weakened, giving the opportunity for quarantine and other measures of human intervention to take effect so that human-to-human transmission cannot be sustained. However, if transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to that of the other four community-acquired HCoVs and influenza viruses, we should prepare well for the arrival of another community-acquired HCoV. In this regard, it is crucial to determine the infection rate in the epicentre of Wuhan by RT\u2013PCR and serology. The real ratios of asymptomatic carriers and patients with mild symptoms as well as the transmission rates in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary spreading are also pivotal.
