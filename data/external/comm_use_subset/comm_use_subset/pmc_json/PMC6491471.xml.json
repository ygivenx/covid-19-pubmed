Reston virus causes disease in non-human primates only, and its circulation appears to be limited to the Philippines and China1. Far less is known about Bombali virus, as its genomic viral RNA was only recently detected in Angolan free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus) and little free-tailed bats (Chaerephon pumilus) in Sierra Leone4.

Furthermore, the evidence linking ebolavirus spillover to a particular species of bat is largely circumstantial. For example, the 1976 and 1979 index cases of Sudan virus disease both worked in a cotton factory in Sudan, where a retrospective investigation eight to nine months after the initial outbreak identified a large roof colony of Trevor\u2019s free-tailed bats (Mops trevori) directly over the working area of the index case19. The putative index case of the 2007 Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Kasa\u00ef-Occidental province of the DRC was said to have purchased bats for consumption following a reported annual migration of hammer-headed bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus) and Franquet\u2019s epauletted fruit bats (Epomops franquetti)20. Lastly, the presumed index case of the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak that started in Guinea was reported to have played in a tree hollow, where DNA traces of Mops condylurus were later identified21.",

            "text": "The majority of research directed towards the identification of the natural reservoir hosts of the ebolaviruses has consisted of cross-sectional surveillance of the sub-Saharan African and Asian bat population for evidence of active and past ebolavirus infection. The predominance of cross-sectional studies can be attributed to the large number of bat species residing within the geographic range of ebolavirus circulation that require investigation, as well as the challenges associated with obtaining diagnostic specimens from a mammal that is difficult to capture due to its elusive nocturnal nature and ability to fly. Collectively, Ebola virus RNA has been detected in three bat species captured in the Republic of the Congo and Gabon (Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franquetti and Myonycteris torquata)22 and Reston virus RNA has been reportedly detected in four bat species captured in the Philippines (Chaerephon plicatus, Cynopterus brachyotis, Miniopterus australis and Miniopterus schreibersii)23. Yet, infectious virus was not isolated from any of these species22,23, indicating that they are either dead-end virus hosts, had cleared virus infection prior to sampling, or that current filovirus isolation techniques lack the sensitivity to recover infectious virus from specimens with low viral loads. Serological reactivity of bat sera with ebolavirus antigens using indirect ELISAs, indirect fluorescent tests, bead-based multiplex assays and/or western blots has been reported in 375 bats representing at least 21 species throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Asia22\u201332. However, interpretation of this data has been exceedingly difficult due to multiple reasons that include: (1) the absence of a panel of positive and negative bat sera for initial serological assay validation and continuing quality control, (2) the use of various uncharacterized recombinant filovirus antigens, and (3) the application of different statistical methods for establishing cutoff values for seropositivity. Nonetheless, ebolavirus serosurveillance offers several distinct advantages compared to surveillance for active virus infection including a longer diagnostic window (i.e., length of time a diagnostic test can detect evidence of infection), no knowledge of virus-tissue tropism and no requirement for destructive sampling.",

The sera were transferred into polypropylene CryoElite Wheaton vials (DWK Life Sciences, Millville, NJ, USA), and then temporarily stored under liquid nitrogen vapors in the biosafety level four laboratory (BSL-4) until they were double bagged, passed through a dunk tank containing 5% Micro-Chem Plus (National Chemical Laboratories Incorporated, Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA) and transported to the gamma-cell irradiator. The doublebagged serum aliquots were sandwiched between layers of dry ice and then exposed to 5 \u00d7 106 rads of gamma-cell irradiation using a cobalt-60 source.",

Wells of 96-well ELISA plates were coated (100 \u00b5L) with the dilution of filovirus antigen lysate (diluent: PBS containing 1% thimerosal) that was found to result in optimal reactivity with sera pooled from each of the filovirus-infected bat groups (1:1000 for the Ebola, Bundibugyo, Ta\u00ef Forest and Reston virus lysates, and 1:2000 for the Marburg, Ravn and Sudan virus lysates) and corresponding wells were coated with an equivalent dilution of uninfected control lysate (1:1000 or 1:2000). After incubation overnight at 4 \u00b0C, the plates were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and 100 \u00b5L of serum diluent (PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% tween-20) was added to each well of the plate. After 10 min, 33 \u00b5L of a 21:521 dilution of gamma-irradiated bat serum pre-diluted in masterplate diluent (PBS containing 5% skim milk powder, 0.5% tween-20 and 1% thimerosal) was added to the first well of the plate and four-fold serial dilutions were performed. Final bat serum concentrations were 1:100, 1:400, 1:1600 and 1:6400. Following a 1 hr incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the plates were washed with PBS-T and 100 \u00b5L of a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-bat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA, Cat#: A140-118P, Lot#: A140-118P-13) in serum diluent was added to the plates. The manufacturer notes that this antibody reacts specifically with bat IgG and with light chains common to other immunoglobulins. After incubation for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C, the plates were washed with PBS-T, 100 \u00b5L of the Two-Component ABTS Peroxidase System (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added, and the plates were allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The plates were then read on a microplate spectrophotometer set at 410 nm. The optical density (OD) values of each four-fold serial dilution were visually inspected to ensure linearity. To negate non-specific background reactivity, adjusted OD values were calculated by subtracting the ODs at each four-fold dilution of wells coated with uninfected control antigen lysate from ODs at corresponding wells coated with filovirus antigen lysate. The adjusted sum OD value was determined by summing the adjusted OD values at each four-fold serial dilution. The average adjusted sum OD of duplicate runs was reported. Notably, performing each indirect ELISA (seven filovirus antigen lysates and two dilutions of uninfected control antigen lysate) in duplicate required only 25 \u00b5L of serum.",

We assume that the seroprevalence of the ebolaviruses in their respective natural reservoir bat hosts approximates this value. However, the prior probability has relatively little influence on determining the magnitude of the cutoff value for seropositivity. The cutoff value for each filovirus-specific indirect ELISA represents the value where the posterior probabilities for the reactivity of the filovirus-specific antisera with homologous antigen and the reactivity of filovirus-na\u00efve sera with this same antigen are equal.",

Strong serological cross-reactivity was observed between Marburg virus antisera and Ravn virus antigen (95%), and Ravn virus antisera and Marburg virus antigen (95%) (Fig. 2a,b). The level of serological cross-reactivity between ebolavirus antisera and ebolavirus antigen varied from 20% (Ta\u00ef Forest virus antisera versus Reston virus antigen) to 100% (Bundibugyo virus antisera versus Ebola virus antigen, Ta\u00ef Forest virus antisera versus Bundibugyo virus antigen, and Reston virus antisera versus Bundibugyo and Ta\u00ef Forest virus antigens) (Fig. 2e\u2013g). Very limited cross-reactivity was observed between marburgvirus antisera and ebolavirus antigen (0%: majority of antisera-antigen combinations; 5%: Marburg virus antisera versus Ta\u00ef Forest virus antigen, Ravn virus antisera versus Bundibugyo and Ta\u00ef Forest virus antigens; 15%: Ravn virus antisera versus Reston virus antigen), and ebolavirus antisera tested against marburgvirus antigen (5.3%: Sudan virus antisera versus Marburg virus antigen; 10.3% Sudan virus antisera versus Ravn virus antigen) (Fig. 2). A Pearson\u2019s Product-Moment Correlation revealed that there was a statistically significant, strong positive correlation between percent filovirus serological cross-reactivity and percent filovirus amino acid identity (r = 0.922, n = 42, p < 0.01).",

This indicates that this system, using seven independent filovirus IgG indirect ELISAs, has the ability to establish an antibody fingerprint from filovirus convalescent bat sera that can be used to predict which of the filovirus species in the system is the most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection (see Supplementary Note for an example of how the antibody fingerprinting was performed in this study).",

Initial validation of the system revealed that the individual filovirus-specific IgG indirect ELISAs exhibited high sensitivity (90\u2013100%) and specificity (100%). Similar to previous studies using human sera, we observed limited to no serological IgG cross-reactivity between the filovirus genera (0\u201315%)41\u201343, varying levels of serological IgG cross-reactivity between the ebolavirus species (20\u2013100%)40,44 and strong serological IgG cross-reactivity within the species Marburg marburgvirus (95%). The low level of serological IgG cross-reactivity between some of the ebolavirus species underscores the necessity of performing all assays within the system to avoid false negative results. Although significant levels of serological IgG cross-reactivity were observed between the prime-boost filovirus-specific antisera and some of the filovirus antigens, when the overall covariance of the seven-individual indirect ELISAs in the system were considered, we were able to predict the filovirus species responsible for past infection 100% of the time using as little as 25 \u03bcL of sera (each serum was tested against each antigen in duplicate). Further evaluation of the performance and predictive ability of our system using seven Marburg virus convalescent serum or whole blood samples collected after primary experimental infection with Marburg virus (or primary experimental infection with Marburg virus plus a \u201cnatural\u201d boost) confirmed that the system was able to predict the filovirus species most likely responsible for past infection. As expected, the filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system was not able to correctly predict whether past infection was due to Marburg virus or Ravn virus 100% of the time. This finding supports the current classification of Marburg and Ravn viruses into a single virus species, Marburg marburgvirus2.",

We employed infectious-based filovirus antigens, rather than recombinant virus protein antigens, as a strategy to increase both the sensitivity (i.e., ability of the filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system to correctly identify those with past exposure to a filovirus as filovirus IgG antibody positive) and specificity (i.e., ability of the filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system to correctly identify those with no past exposure to a filovirus as filovirus IgG antibody negative) of the system. Although recombinant filovirus antigens can be generated in large quantities and do not require a BSL-4 laboratory for production, the use of single recombinant virus proteins for antibody detection can lead to false negative results if an individual\u2019s antibody repertoire is not directed against the particular recombinant virus protein that was employed23,26\u201331. Alternatively, false positive serological results can occur when recombinant virus antigens unknowingly share similar epitopes with other virus antigens for which the study population possesses antibodies against45,46. False positive results can also arise from failing to account for non-specific serological reactivity resulting from the presence of non-virus contaminants in an antigen preparation. Here, we negated non-specific serological reactivity to Vero E6 cell components by subtracting the reactivity of wells coated with uninfected antigen lysate from the reactivity of corresponding wells coated with filovirus antigen lysate. While the majority of previously published ebolavirus serosurveys of bats used recombinant filovirus antigens generated in bacterial expression systems, not all of the studies implemented procedures to negate non-specific reactivity between residual bacterial epitopes in the antigen preparation and antibacterial antibodies in bat sera27,29. Like the majority of published ebolavirus serosurveys of bats, we performed serial serum dilutions to assess for linearity and specificity22,24,25,27\u201330. Most importantly, we included pooled filovirus-specific bat antisera as a positive control and pooled filovirus-na\u00efve bat sera as a negative control in every run to ensure that our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system continually performed as expected.",

Four out of the 11 previously published ebolavirus serosurveys of bats used Ebola virus antigen only to detect ebolavirus IgG antibodies22,24\u201326 and another four of these serosurveys used Ebola and Reston antigens only to detect ebolavirus IgG antibodies23,27\u201329. Based on the low serological cross-reactivity between Ebola virus antigen and Sudan virus antisera (68.4%) and Reston virus antigen and Sudan virus antisera (57.7%) observed in our study, we predict that the serosurveys using Ebola virus antigen or Ebola and Reston virus antigens only would have missed the opportunity to detect bats previously infected with Sudan virus. Likewise, due to the high level of serological cross reactivity between ebolavirus-specific antisera and heterologous ebolavirus antigen that we observed in our study, it is possible that the serological reactivity of bat sera with Ebola or Reston virus antigens in the previous serosurveys was due to past infection with one of the other known ebolaviruses or an undescribed ebolavirus. Although we successfully used quadratic discriminant analysis to predict which of the filovirus species in the system was most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection, only nucleotide sequence data can be used to ascertain infection with a particular filovirus. Furthermore, incrimination of an ebolavirus-natural reservoir host relationship requires consistent detection of both active (RNA and virus isolation from tissues/bodily fluids suggestive of a transmission mechanism) and past infection with a particular ebolavirus through space and time.",

First, this system was validated using virus-specific antisera from prime-boosted bats and sera from filovirus-na\u00efve bats. Although all seven of the Marburg virus convalescent whole blood and serum samples collected from ERBs after primary experimental Marburg virus inoculation or following a \u201cnatural\u201d boost were marburgvirus IgG antibody positive, these samples had markedly lower marburgvirus-specific IgG antibody levels compared to samples collected from the bats in this study that were prime-boosted with one of seven filoviruses. This suggests that the sensitivity of the individual filovirus IgG indirect ELISAs may be lower than what was reported here (90\u2013100%) using filovirus-specific antisera from prime-boosted bats and filovirus na\u00efve bat sera. However, statistical determination of seropositivity cutoff values for the indirect ELISAs were largely driven by the variance surrounding the mean reactivity of the filovirus-na\u00efve sera with each of the virus antigens. It is likely that circulation and long-term maintenance of the ebolaviruses in their natural reservoir hosts leads to multiple virus exposures throughout the lifetime of an individual, resulting in boosting of virus-specific IgG antibody levels. \u201cNatural\u201d boosting of virus-specific IgG antibody levels in ERBs that had been previously infected with Marburg virus was observed during a recent experimental transmission study shortly after documenting virus infection and seroconversion in na\u00efve contact bats36. Others have reported periodic boosting of rabies virus neutralizing antibody titers in a wild colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)47. Second, we used a goat anti-bat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody in our system. This antibody was generated using sera from ERBs, as well as sera from nine other bat species comprising four chiropteran families (manufacturer product datasheet). While this antibody has been confirmed to react with sera from these 10 chiropteran species and has been used with success to detect IgG antibodies in sera from >27 bat species comprising seven chiropteran families48\u201357, it is possible that its reactivity with IgG antibodies from divergent bat species might diminish. If this is the case, the concentration of secondary antibody may need to be optimized prior to testing a new species of bat or an alternative secondary antibody may need to be used. Third, our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system includes seven virus antigens that represent all of the reported culturable filoviruses. Given the recent discoveries of filovirus RNA from divergent bat families in geographically distant locations (Lloviu virus from Miniopterus schreibersii [family Miniopteridae] in Spain58 and Hungary59; Bombali virus from Chaerephon pumilus [family Molossidae] and Mops condylurus [family Molossidae] in Sierra Leone4; M\u011bngl\u00e0 virus from a Rousettus bat [family Pteropodidae] in China60), we expect that there are a number of undiscovered ebolaviruses that continue to circulate in nature. However, we believe that the genetic diversity of ebolavirus antigens (up to 61.6%) included in our system will allow for the detection of past infection with a novel ebolavirus, and prediction of the ebolavirus species that is most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection.",
