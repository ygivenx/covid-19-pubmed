The afp gene is a member of the family of albuminoid genes, including serum albumin (SA), vitamin D-binding protein (VTDB) and \u03b1-albumin (afamin). The albuminoid genes evolved from a common ancestor and exhibit considerable similarity in their primary structure. For example, human AFP and human serum albumin (HSA) share 40% identity with highly conserved cysteine residues. Human AFP consists of 609 amino acids, has a molecular mass of 69 kDa and contains only one glycosylation site (N233). However, the glycosylation site may link various carbohydrate moieties, and the structure of the carbohydrate moieties varies in different tissues and diseases [3].",

AFP is also an immunomodulatory molecule, as transfer of foetal AFP through the placenta into the mother\u2019s circulation is correlated with remission of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders [9]. Recombinant expression of human AFP is under development as a biopharmaceutical for the treatment of autoimmune diseases [9], and human AFP is also being used as a bioactivated molecule in drug discovery studies for cancer treatment [4\u20138]. Recombinant expression of human AFP has been described in Escherichia coli expression systems [10,11], in yeast [12] and in the milk of transgenic goats [13], but human AFP expression is unsatisfying in these systems. For example, human AFP production in E. coli expression systems yields inclusion bodies, and refolding of this material is not practical for commercial production [13]. In addition, human AFP produced in the milk of transgenic goats is not easily purified.",

We harvested the medium after infection at each monitoring time, and the medium was replaced with HBS buffer.

The eluted 6\u00d7 His-tagged proteins were concentrated and purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column.

Myeloma cells in the exponential phase were mixed with the spleen cells in a certain proportion and fused by 50% PEG3000 buffer. Both cell types were cultured in HAT (H-hypoxanthine, A-aminopterin, T-thymidine) medium supplemented with feeder cells to form a hybridoma cell line. The hybridoma cells that secreted antibody were screened by ELISA and continually cloned by the limited dilution method; thus, a stable anti-AFP antibody producing hybridoma cell line was obtained. BALB/C mice were inoculated with positive clones. Anti-AFP antibody was harvested from ascites fluid and purified by affinity chromatography. The specificity of the monoclonal antibody (with a titre higher than 5000 for AFP) was ascertained by ELISA and Western blot assay to prevent interference from human albumin, which has a structure similar to that of human AFP. The results of the ELISA and Western blot assay showed the specific binding of the monoclonal antibody to human AFP and a lack of reaction to human albumin [19].",

First, we observed the expression of AFPR, and the results revealed that Bel 7402 expressed AFPR and that the receptor was located in the cell membrane (Figure 5A). Second, Bel 7402 cells were treated with R-AFP or E-AFP (20 mg/l) for 24 h, and the 3H-TdR incorporation results indicated that after treatment with R-AFP or E-AFP, the content of 3H-TdR in Bel 7402 cells was markedly enhanced (Figure 5B, groups 2 and 3 respectively). We also selected R-AFP or E-AFP (20 mg/l) co-treated with a human AFP antibody (anti-AFP). The results showed that anti-AFP (40 mg/l) antagonized the effects of R-AFP or E-AFP (Figure 5C, groups 4 and 5 respectively). When we changed the concentration of R-AFP or E-AFP (10\u201380 mg/l), the results indicated that the 3H-TdR content in the Bel 7402 cells was markedly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. The peak of the increase reached 123.0% compared with the control group (Figure 5C, the red and blue lines). Anti-AFP (40 mg/l) antagonized the effects of R-AFP and E-AFP, but as the concentration of R-AFP or E-AFP increased, the antagonizing effect decreased (Figure 5C, green and purple lines). Further, we used the MTT method to analyse the effects of R-AFP or E-AFP (20 mg/l) on the proliferation of Bel 7402 cells, and the results also demonstrated that R-AFP or E-AFP stimulated the proliferation of Bel 7402 cells (Figure 5D). In addition, anti-AFP reversed the effects of R-AFP or E-AFP (Figure 5E). These results demonstrated that the effects of R-AFP on cellular proliferation are similar to those of E-AFP.

To extract human AFP, a great deal of human cord blood is needed, which is difficult to purify. Expressing R-AFP in the Bac-to-Bac system allows a large amount of purified bioactive protein to be obtained without the need for human cord blood. R-AFP may allow the study of the biochemical features of human AFP and drug screening. Human AFP expression was previously reported in E. coli expression systems, in yeast and in the milk of transgenic goats, but these expression systems produced low amounts of human AFP. For example, human AFP expressed in E. coli was deposited in bacterial inclusion bodies and subjected to harsh denaturants [10,11,21]. Human AFP expressed in yeast was indistinguishable immunologically from authentic human AFP, and the human AFP produced in yeast contains seven extra amino acid residues at the N-terminus that are not present in mature human AFP [12]. The purification of human AFP expressed in the milk of transgenic goats was difficult and time consuming [13]. There is no such problem when human AFP produced in the Bac-to-Bac system. The Bac-to-Bac system had achieved successful protein expression levels for potential drug applications [16]. The R-AFP produced in the Bac-to-Bac system is highly expressed and easily purified, and its bioactivity is similar to that of the native human AFP. This finding will aid clinical research on the immunomodulatory function of this protein.",

Recombinant protein was expressed intracellularly and needed time to be modified and transported to the extracellular space. Thus, the best harvest time depends on the protein and the experiment [14]. In the optimization of R-AFP expression, we found that many cells died and were lysed after 96 h. Therefore, the best harvest time was approximately 72\u201396 h.",

            "text": "The effects of extracellular human AFP on cellular proliferation are mainly achieved through signal transduction mediated by AFPR. Previously, we found that Bel 7402 cells express AFPR [8]. In the present study, we found that AFPR was highly expressed in the membrane of Bel 7402 cells. This result provided further evidence that the effects of extracellular human AFP on the proliferation of Bel 7402 cells were mediated by membrane-bound AFPR. Previously, we found that human AFP bound to AFPR might activate cAMP and Ca2+ to stimulate the transduction of cellular signals to stimulate N-ras and c-myc expression, leading to promote proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells and Bel 7402 cells [19,22]. In the present study, R-AFP and E-AFP played similar roles in the proliferation of Bel 7402 cells, suggesting that R-AFP harbours biological characteristics identical with those of E-AFP. Human AFP is a protein that is specifically expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We previously found that cytoplasmic human AFP could interact with signal molecules, such as caspase-3 [7], retinoic acid receptor-\u03b2 (RAR-\u03b2) [23] and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) [5]. These interactions inhibited the transduction of apoptotic signals and activated growth signals, which led to the promotion of proliferation or drug resistance in liver cancer cells. These results suggested that human AFP may interact with these signalling molecules. In the present study, we successfully expressed and purified human AFP protein. We also found that the bioactivity of human AFP protein is similar to that of cytoplasmic human AFP. Recombinantly expressed human AFP is soluble, is stable and can be used to identify signalling molecules or potential drug interactions by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [24,25]. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the successful expression and purification of R-AFP, which paves the way for future structural and functional studies of human AFP.",
