Evidence suggests red blood cells (RBC) can sense local oxygen (O2) conditions and signal the vasculature, via adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to increase capillary flow. We hypothesized that sepsis impaired microvascular autoregulation over the entire capillary network, within a capillary and within the RBC. Study objectives were to: 1) measure capillary response time within hypoxic capillaries (capillaries with RBC hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO2) < 20 %), 2) test the null hypothesis that sepsis had no effect on RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux and 3) develop a pathophysiological model.",

Moreover, comprehensive diagnosis is today delayed by the long time-to-result required for the quantitative measurement of blood proteins in centralized laboratories. Therefore, the need to combine a rapid, near-patient diagnostic platform with the accurate measurement of proteins in complex matrices is the key to improve sepsis patient outcome. We developed nanofluidic biosensors that accelerate molecular interaction and thereby reduces incubation time from hours to minutes. Biosensors are analyzed in the abioSCOPE, a miniaturized automated fluorescence microscope. Fluorescent antibodies specific for the tested protein are mixed with 50 \u03bc l of blood collected at the patient\u2019s fingertip. Complexes of detecting antibodies and analytes are captured on the sensing area of the biosensors and, upon excitation, emit a signal proportional to the concentration of the analyte. As a proof-of-concept, we prepared biosensors for the quantification of pancreatic stone protein (PSP/reg), a promising biomarker that showed its superior ability to predict the outcome of patients affected by sepsis in several clinical studies [1].",

Global mortality in the study period was 44,59 %, the mortality associated to MDR infection was 51,16 %. In fact, mortality of ESBL infections was not so higher than the global one (48,57 %) whereas CPB infection weighed down mortality to reach 71,43 %. In the same way, length of stay was significantly longer in MDR infected patients (18,37 days \u00b1 11.6 STD) than non-MDR infected ones (8,66 \u00b1 4.60 STD, p < 0,001).

Length of stay and duration of MV were found to be risk factors for acquiring MDR infection in ICU. Ventilator associated pneumonia was the most frequent acquired infection as well in non MDR infected patients as in both ESBL and CPB. Acinetobacter Baumannii was the leading isolate from CPB infection (60 %) followed by Klebsiella Pneumoniae (27 %).

Most patients had multiorgan failure requiring support. Eight hospital employees had MERS requiring ICU admission for a median stay of 28 days: 7 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 4 were treated with proning, 4 needed continuous renal replacement therapy and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hospital mortality of ICU MERS patients was 53 % (0 % for the hospital employees). All MERS patients were admitted in single negative pressure rooms, which were promptly increased from 14 to 38 rooms. The nurse-to-patient ratio was ~1.2:1. Infection prevention practices were intensified. For example, the consumption of surface disinfectants and hand hygiene gel increased by ~30 % and an average of 17 N95 masks were used per patient/day. Family visits were restricted to 2 hours/day and the ICU physicians communicated with the next of kin by phone daily. During the outbreak, 2 ICU nurses and 1 physician tested positive for MERS-CoV, had mild disease and recovered fully. Although most ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS, none refused to report to work. However, 27.0 % of nurses and 18.4 % of physicians working in the MERS ICUs had upper respiratory symptoms, but tested negative for MERS-CoV. The total sick leave duration was 138 days for nurses and 30 days for physicians.",

The organism produces an array of factors that contribute to its virulence. Two such virulence factors are the Psl exopolysaccharide, which contributes to bacterial persistence, and the PcrV protein which contributes to the virulence of the organism. MEDI3902 is a novel bivalent, bispecific mAb that selectively binds to both factors, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxicity and immune evasion properties of the pathogen. Psl and PcrV target expression is independent of antibiotic susceptibility status; therefore, MEDI3902 also has the potential to be active against multi-drug resistant strains of P aeruginosa. MEDI3902 is being developed for the prevention of P aeruginosa pneumonia.

Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of serum creatinine (SCr) per time unit and is an important measure to approximate \u201ctrue\u201d GFR. CrCl can be estimated either by population based mathematical equations or it can be measured using serum and urine creatinine concentration after collection of urine over a certain period of time. Deterioration of CrCl/GFR identifies patients with acute kidney injury and is important for appropriate drug dosing. In our ICU practice the MDRD-eGFR equation is standard of care for a \u201creliable\u201d estimation of GFR. Recently, the CKD-EPI-SCr equation was introduced as a more accurate measure especially in patients with higher GFRs. However, in critical ill patients there is no steady state of SCr, which is a prerequisite in order to estimate GFR irrespective of the mathematical formula used. We regularly treat patients with demonstrably highly impaired kidney function in spite of \u201cnormal\u201d estimated GFR leading to toxic levels of renally cleared drugs. We investigated the actual practice of GFR approximation in Dutch ICUs.",

It is possible that this may be secondary to the routine post-operative admission of patients with risk factors to the HDU environment. Risk factors found to be associated with AKI were consistent with the results of previous studies [3]. Even Stage 1 AKI resulted in an increased mortality at one year. Interpretation of our findings is limited by confounding. Early recognition of risk factors will aid identification of patients at increased risk of AKI. Subsequent pre-optimisation and normalisation of reversible risk factors where possible as well as planning of appropriate post-operative care may reduce the burden of AKI.",

Both nebulisers were put in-line with the humidifier nebuliser (Aquamist, Intersurgical) system. Two nebuliser positions (distal and proximal to the patient) were assessed for their effect on both emitted and tracheal dose delivery at supplemental gas flow rates of 5 and 11 LPM (n = 3). For tracheal dose the nebuliser was connected to the head model via facemask. The head model was connected to a breathing simulator (BPM 15, Vt 500 mL, I:E 1:1,) and drug collected on an absolute filter (RespirGard II 303, Baxter).

Methods of titrating PEEP to safely recruit the lungs have included achieving adequate SpO2, attaining best compliance, or increasing PEEP while monitoring esophageal manometry to establish a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (Ptp). Bedside ultrasonography is available and useful as a diagnostic tool in the care of critically ill patients. Preliminary work identified marked differences in excursions between the dorsal and ventral diaphragms during lung-protective tidal ventilation in ARDS patients. We hypothesize that lung recruitment in the supine patient may be detected non-invasively by increased dorsal diaphragmatic excursions, indicating that dependent lung regions may be recruiting with adequate PEEP.",

It can be described as V(t) = Vinsp \u00b7 e^(-t/(R \u00b7 C)) where V is the lung volume at time t, Vinsp the volume at end inspiration, R the resistance and C the compliance of the lungs. The product of R \u00b7 C is called \u03c4 (tau). Although R and C can vary considerably between different lung regions, traditional pulmonary function tests provide global values, only. Therefore, we recently proposed a novel method to obtain regional \u03c4 values using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). As this approach can be challenging in presence of small ventilation amplitudes, noisy signals and heterogeneity we determined in this study its robustness.",

Severe COPD in particular is often characterized by inhomogeneous ventilation. In case of mechanical ventilation in obstructive pulmonary diseases or ARDS, modern ICU ventilators provide accurate measurements of pressure-volume curves on a global, but not on a regional level. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in contrast is an established non-invasive tool to measure regional ventilation. The aim of our study was to calculate an EIT-based (32x32 pixel, 50 frames per second) expiratory time constant \u03c4 (tau) for each image pixel and a global one for the entire lung and to validate it against a global volume signal measured at the airway opening.",

Esophageal pressure, used as a surrogate for pleural pressure (PPL) is unreliable for determining absolute end-expiratory esophageal pressure, because of extra-pleural effects on measurements.

Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO[sub]2[/sub]R) can control CO[sub]2[/sub], but existing devices are expensive and require considerable expertise to operate. Since CO[sub]2[/sub] is transported predominantly as bicarbonate, using dialysis to remove bicarbonate offers several advantages, but this approach has been limited by bicarbonate replacement problems. However, contemporary understanding of acid-base balance treats bicarbonate as an anion whose concentration is dependent on the strong ion difference (SID). We hypothesised that a novel dialysate designed to remove bicarbonate, but maintain SID, would lower CO[sub]2[/sub] with no change in pH. We tested this hypothesis in a rodent dialysis model, comparing our dialysate to a conventional solution (Prismasol\u2122).",

Risk factors for liver injury in the ICU include toxicity of drugs and TPN, but etiology often remains unknown. Currently, there is emerging interest in the relation between intestinal failure and liver injury. The occurrence of IFALD is mostly attributed to the use of TPN in patients with intestinal failure, but recent data suggest that interruption of the enterohepatic cycle also may be an important cause. Diarrhea induces nutrient malabsorption but may also impair reabsorption of bile acids and disturbance of the gut-liver axis. Along this line of reasoning diarrhea may be a hitherto unidentified risk factor for liver injury through the development of IFALD.",

Since 5 % variation of EEVCO2 corresponded to \u00b10.05 of RQfixed, we compared the EEVCO2 and EE among patients with measured RQ lower, matching, or higher than this range. Statistical analysis was conducted by paired t-test of EEVCO2 and EE, and bias was determined from the mean difference (kcal/d). Actual 5 % accuracy rates of EEVCO2 for each group were also calculated. All analyses were conducted on SPSS statistics version 22 (IBM, USA).",

Two of them received a one-hour BLS session conducted by an intensivist assisted by 3 medical students. Sessions contained: a theoretical lecture and a practical simulation-based training using low-fidelity manikins (MiniAnnePlus\u00ae, Laerdal). Between 2 and 3 months later, both trained and non-trained students were assessed using a serious game reproducing real-life cardiac arrest situation (3D real-time simulation software, Stayingalive\u00ae, ILUMENS-Dassault system). Primary outcome was the time spent to complete the serious game (from onset of cardiac arrest to shock delivery and recovery). Secondary outcomes included knowledge of emergency call, hand placement during chest compressions and electrodes placement of automated external defibrillator.",

The clinical picture consisted of vomiting, diarrhea, and progressive generalized muscle weakness requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, with subsequent ICU admission. Severe hypokalemia was documented (minimum K+ 1.2 mmol/L), complicated by frequent ventricular premature beats with prolonged QT interval (corrected value was 640 ms). Magnesium sulfate and a K+ infusion were administered, but serum K+ remained low. Serum K+ was then 2.2 mmol/L and barium levels were 0.04 mmol/L (toxic range). Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was started. This resulted in a rapid decrease in barium levels and normalization of serum K+. Clinical improvement ensued with the correction of hypokalemia and restored muscular function, allowing spontaneous ventilation and extubation 6 hours later. Barium was persistently undetectable from 12 hours after the beginning of CVVHDF (<0.006 mmol/L). The patient was later transferred to the Psychiatry department, with an uneventful hospital stay.",

This patient presented with symptoms typical of severe barium intoxication, non-responsive to K+ supplementation. Clinicians in the ICU should remain aware of the potential ingestion of unusual chemicals such as barium chloride in the appropriate clinical context, as the risk of availability through internet purchases may continue to rise in the future.

Although a causal relationship between delayed discharge, night discharge and mortality cannot be proved; this data adds to the evidence.

The REALISTIC-80 (Realities, Expectations and Attitudes to LIfe Support Technologies in Intensive Care for Octogenarians) trial studied the outcomes of very elderly patients admitted to ICUs in Canada. Not only was mortality high, but long-term physical and functional recovery was also poor, raising questions about the appropriateness of ICU admission in this group. These findings also carry significant economic implications. Using data from REALISTIC-80 trial, we examined the cost of ICU admission for the very elderly, factors affecting this cost, and the potential savings of reducing admissions that are either undesired by the patient or medically futile.",

Deterioration detection based on changes of a single vital sign can result in missed deterioration events and high false alarm rates.

These systems offer improved performance compared to single-parameter systems, but were created through physician consensus and may not be making optimal use of the available data. Here we explore use of modern data mining techniques to derive a high performance multi- parameter deterioration detection algorithm, the Early Deterioration Indicator (EDI).",

Regarding the training program: 77% knows the CoBatriCE project; 89% knows the PACT and 95% finds it usefull.

More than 50% of non-fellow respondents identified that fellows ranked below expectations in counseling about the emotional impact of emergency situations; fellows reported they had the least amount of training in this area and were least comfortable addressing patient and family emotional issues. Staff physicians were least comfortable teaching and assessing fellows\u2019 capacity to address emotion, and had received the least amount of training in this area themselves. All non-trainee groups described fellows\u2019 focus on giving information over building rapport; fellows indicated their challenges may be related to the absence of a prior relationship with patients and families, and their own discomfort in talking about death and dying. Despite challenges in the relational aspects of communication, topics of greatest interest to fellows included organ donation, adverse events, conflict, and family meetings. Preferred learning methods included simulation and feedback in clinical practice. This data guided the development of a communication skills curriculum involving 5 formal sessions over a year, and structured feedback during CCM rotations. Each formal session consisted of a didactic presentation and simulated practice. One formal session was dedicated to basic principles of communication, which were incorporated into each of the topic-based sessions. A form to guide multidisciplinary preceptors in providing feedback to fellows in clinical practice was also developed and implemented. Preliminary data indicate that fellows value the curriculum and feedback; more objective curricular evaluation is ongoing.",

Moreover where in general relative-staff conflict tend to be centered around crisis moments (end-of-life decision making, patients\u2019 death) [3], we found that in a multi-ethnic ICU conflicts tend to be present during various care phases (curative phase, end-of-life decision making, non-curative phase, patients\u2019 death) and concern a broad spectrum of care aspects ( e.g. bedside care activities, seeking a second opinion), easily assaulting the core of actors\u2019 identity.

An instruction box is included with ICU materials (Fig. 108). These materials are used to give children a more tactile experience of the ICU. Guidance materials for when a patient may die were developed included. For example: there are little boxes that can be decorated by the children to put in a memory or a token of grief. Pedagogical staff are available to support parents, children and staff. If there are more profound problems there will be referral to our children\u2019s psychologist. Our hospital photographers can be called upon to commemorate the last moments (Fig. 109). We instructed our nurses and doctors on how to use these materials and how to guide children.
