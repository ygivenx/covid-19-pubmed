HIV-1 has the ability to rapidly mutate in infected individuals [3] and take advantage of host genes like C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) [4], therefore it is imperative to know whether certain variations confer any survival advantage to the virus. HIV-1 subtype-specific differentiations with respect to transmission, replication and progression of the disease have been reported previously [5,6]. Recently, we have reported an in-vitro study of Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat) subtypes and demonstrated that TatB activates the HIV-1 subtype-C Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) promoter greater than TatC due to differential Trans-Activation Response element (TAR) interaction [7,8].",

Tat binds to nascent leader RNA and augments the HIV-1 promoter for transcription of viral genes [12]. Tat is made from a multiple spliced viral mRNA and expressed during early stages of viral infection [13]. The Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) of Tat constitutes amino acid sequences of RKKRRQRRR, which enables Tat to accumulate in the nucleolus [14]. The trans-activation domain of Tat (1\u201348 aa) is implicated in interactions with several cellular proteins [15], namely CyclinT1, Sp1, Histone Acetyl Transferase (HAT) and Protein Kinase R (PKR), while the basic domain of Tat (49\u201372 aa) is involved in binding to TAR [16], nuclear localization [17] and plasma membrane permeability [18]. The second exon (73\u2013101 aa) defines a separate domain that is involved in cell death [19]. In addition, Tat is involved in RNAi silencing suppressor (RSS) activity [20] and induction of cell death in T cells [21].",

            "text": "RNA silencing is a eukaryotic posttranscriptional gene regulation mechanism and innate defense to abrogate virus infections [22]. Understanding complex interplay between siRNAs, micro-RNAs, and RSS with host antiviral immunity has revolutionized our current thinking of replication of many viruses including HIV-1, influenza and other viruses, which have widespread implications for viral replication and pathogenesis [23,24]. Viruses have developed strategies to abrogate this pathway by interacting with the proteins involved, namely a double-stranded RNA-specific endoribonuclease (DICER) and Drosha [25]. In general, human cells evoke a strong small interfering RNA (siRNA) or micro RNA (miRNA) mediated response upon HIV-1 infection that could control HIV-1 replication [26]. Tat derived from HIV-1 pNL4-3-subtype B has been shown to possess RSS activity by interfering with the cellular siRNA/microRNA machinery by interacting with the enzyme DICER [27]. RNA silencing-mediated translation repression plays a strategic role in determining the viral set-point in a newly HIV-1-infected patient [20]. The differential abilities of Tat subtypes in various viral activities is due to its differences in the genetic pattern, which in turn modulate its functions [28], however, it is not known how these genetic differences would play a role in the RSS activity. The majority of HIV-1 infections are due to genetic subtype C in India underscores the importance of determining the RSS potentials of natural Tat variants with the control subtypes TatB and TatC.",

In-vitro studies have shown that Tat promotes cell death during HIV-1 infection via intrinsic pathway in a number of human cell lines [32]. Tat is secreted out from the infected cells [32], which are then endocytosed by neighboring cells [33] to cause cell death. The RGD motif of subtype B Tat exon-2 is involved in increased cell death [34]. The glutamine-rich region of HIV-1 Tat protein is involved in the Tat-mediated cell death of T-cells [35]. The cysteine-rich domain and basic domains of HIV-1 Tat peptides inhibit angiogenesis and induce endothelial cell death [36]. The core region has a highly conserved phenylalanine (F) and, in combination with the end of cysteine-rich region, is important in tubulin binding and cell death [37]. Numerous evidences suggest that Tat plays an important role in mediating cell death, which is associated with immune suppression [38,39,40,41], although other HIV-1 proteins (GP120, nef, vpr, vpu, and protease) have also been shown to induce cell death [42,43,44,45]. Mechanisms by which Tat has been reported to induce cell death include upregulation of several apoptotic proteins Fas ligand, Bax, caspase 8, Receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells (RCAS)-1, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), activation of cyclin-dependent kinases, microtubule alteration and inhibition of expression of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase [39,46,47].",

TatB, the representative Tat from subtype B; TatC, the representative Tat from subtype C; TatN12, a subtype C variant; TatD60, also a subtype C variant; and TatVT6, a B/C recombinant were used in this study. These variants showed more than 80% sequence similarity to subtype TatC. The unique mutations in these variants as compared to TatC are shown in the Figure 1A. The amino acid sequence comparisons between subtype TatB (pNL4-3) and TatC (93IN905) revealed 9 amino acid changes in almost all domains of Tat exon 1 sequence (Figure 1A). Tat protein expression was measured after 24 h of transfection on human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells with Tat variants and Tat subtypes by western blotting. The empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a control to measure the relative protein intensity. TatB protein was expressed higher (p < 0.005) than that of TatC. TatN12 and TatVT6 proteins were expressed similarly to TatC. TatD60 was expressed at a higher level than other TatC variants, namely TatN12 and TatVT6, and also higher (p < 0.005) than TatC (Figure 1B,C). All Tat variants and subtypes were well expressed (p < 0.0005) at the translational level which were normalized to the expression levels of control GAPDH and the relative protein intensity was calculated from the control pCMV-Myc vector. Tat RNA expression was measured after 24 h of transfection with Tat variants on HEK293T cells by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). The empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a control to measure the relative RNA intensity. All Tat variants and subtypes were well expressed (p < 0.0005) at the transcriptional level which were normalized to the expression levels of control beta-actin and the relative RNA intensity was calculated from the control plasmid Cytomegalovirus expressing an N-terminally Myc-tagged protein (pCMV-Myc) vector. We observed a less significant difference between TatB and TatC subtypes (p < 0.05), however there were no significant changes between TatC and Tat variants indicating that the genetic variations in Tat variants might not be affected at the RNA expressional levels (Figure 1D,E). These observed differences at the protein and RNA level with respect to subtypes and variants might be due to the amino acid variations found in Tat proteins.",

Tat is reported to act as suppressor of RNAi by binding to DICER (RNA-specific endoribonucleases), thereby causing RNAi suppression [27,52]. It has been demonstrated that Tat variants have been found to show widely varying potential for their ability to activate HIV-1 LTR promoter [1,27,53,54] via TAR interactions [7] through hydrogen bonds [8]. However, there is no data available to address whether these Tat variants and subtypes differ in their ability as a suppressor of RNAi or mediated cell death.

Tat variants were chosen based on the similarities in their genetic and functional activities. Before further investigation of control subtypes (TatB, TatC), our variants (TatN12, TatD60, and TatVT6) on RSS activity and cell death, we verified the expression levels of Tat at protein and RNA levels by western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. We found TatB was better expressed at the protein level than TatC, which could be due to unique variation between these subtypes. TatVT6 was better expressed than TatC, perhaps due to the chimeric nature of TatVT6. TatB and the Tat variants showed similar levels of RNA expression, but TatC showed a slightly reduced level of RNA expression.

This differential RSS activity might be due to the differential genetic signature pattern of subtypes; however, the protein expressions might also modulate the differential activities. We examined cell death by analyzing the DNA content of propidium-iodide treated cells using flow analysis and by cytochrome C release. Under identical conditions, TatC from an Indian isolate showed low levels of cell death when compared with those from subtype TatB. It is likely that reduced cell death mediated by HIV-1 TatC may result in a greater number of susceptible host cells for the virus in comparison to HIV-1 TatB infection. On other hand, Tat triggers high levels of cell death which may be critical for the virus at the end of the cell-cycle process to release virions from the human cells [21,55]. TatB showed a higher level of cell death than TatC, which could be due to variation in the cysteine-rich and glutamine-rich regions that are known to mediate cell death. TatVT6, a B/C recombinant, showed higher cell death than TatC, but lower than TatB, which could be due to a cysteine-rich region from originating from TatB and the glutamine region from TatC. This study elucidates the importance of unique polymorphisms in Tat variants (TatN12 and TatD60), as well as subtype-specific variations in cysteine and glutamine regions of TatVT6 in causing varying levels of cell death and RSS activities.",

The GFP-expressing cells were counted using ImageJ software (in Cell Counter plugin). The total number of GFP cells were plotted against each transfected condition. The un-transfected cells were used as a control for the transfected cells. The cells treated with shRNA-GFPvector + empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a control to show that there was no effect of our expression pCMV-Myc vector in RSS activity. More than 10 to 15 regions were captured for each transfected condition and the accumulative data were plotted. Multiple-group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by student t-test and are presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M.), ** moderately significant (p < 0.005), * significant (p < 0.05), NS is non-significant. All experiments were repeated three times.",

Panel (A and B) HEK293T cells (1 \u03bcg plasmid DNA/well in 1 \u00d7 106 cells) were transfected with Tat variants (TatN12 or TatVT6 or TatD60) or Tat subtypes (TatB or TatC) or empty pCMV-Myc vector. After 24 h of transfection, cells were stained with PI (10 \u03bcg/mL) for 20 to 30 mins on Ice under dark condition. The flow cytometry (BD-LSRII) was performed to determine cell death and the data was analyzed using FlowJo 10.3 software. PI stained cells fall in the PE channel. In the plot, the X-axis represents FSC-H and the Y-axis represents PE. The un-stained cells were used as a control to make gating for the transfected cells. The cells treated with empty pCMV-Myc vector were used as a control to show that there was no effect of our expression pCMV-Myc vector in causing cell death. The relative cell death of Tat variants was measured by subtracting empty pCMV-Myc vector values. Multiple-group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by student t-test and are presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. *** Highly significant (p < 0.0005), ** moderately significant (p < 0.005), * significant (p < 0.05), NS is non-significant.
