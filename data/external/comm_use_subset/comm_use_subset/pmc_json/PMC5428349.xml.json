According to the Swedish OCTO and NONA immune longitudinal studies, immune risk profiles (IRP) associated with low-grade inflammation, including an inverse ratio of CD4/CD8, a reduction in B cells, the depletion of na\u00efve T cells, an increased frequency of well\u2212differentiated CD28\u2212CD57+ T cells and the expansion of CMV-specific oligoclonal cells, have strong associations with morbidity and mortality in the elderly9, 10. Several studies have demonstrated that classical markers of immunosenescence such as a high frequency CD28\u2212 T cells and CD31\u2212 na\u00efve T cells strongly predict subsequent disease progression, less CD4+ T cell restoration after 2 years of treatment and poor responsiveness to vaccination after ART independent of other predictors in HIV-1+ patients11\u201313. Thus, immunosenescence due to both HIV-1 infection and aging may explain the accelerated development of AIDS and poor outcomes in older HIV-1-infected patients.",

Fortunately, Asian macaques such as rhesus macaques (RM) and pigtailed macaques (PTM) infected with multiple SIV strains or related artificial chimeras (HSIV/SHIV) are desirable animal models to study the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS as well as its prevention and treatment14. Furthermore, existing evidence indicates that aged RM may serve as a translational model for immunosenescence research, because their immune system ages in a manner that is similar to the process in humans15\u201317. Recent studies have detected a high level of viral replication in aged RM with severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) or influenza due to increased inflamm-aging18, 19. Surprisingly, some AIDS cases have even been found in SIV-infected natural hosts that are generally regarded as non-pathogenic models and that are primarily aged animals20. It has been suggested that aged non-human primates have a high susceptibility to various types of infections. Our previous studies have revealed that ChRM act either as an excellent model for HIV-1 infection in humans or as a favorable model to research the mechanisms of immunosenescence21\u201323. Thus, there are reasons for believing that old ChRM infected with SIV might be a favorable model to study the pathogenesis and treatment of the HIV-1-infected elderly population. In this study, we compared the immunological, virological and gene-expression dynamics between young and old ChRM during early SIVmac239 infection to identify the characteristics of elderly AIDS patients and to explore the interactions between immunosenescence and HIV/SIV infection.",

Thirty-five days post-infection (dpi), 4 old macaques without the Mamu-B*03, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17 alleles gradually died of severe diarrhea and wasting disease even in spite of antibiotic treatment, whereas 4 young macaques lacking the protective MHC class I alleles remained alive during early infection (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table S1). To determine whether this increased risk of death was associated with a high level of viremia, we monitored the plasma viral loads of all of the animals. Similarly to the 9.63 \u00d7 106 copies/ml plasma in the young animals, a mean peak viral load of 1.58 \u00d7 107 copies/ml plasma was found in the acute phase in the old ChRM (P = 0.6468). Throughout the infection, no significant differences in viral load were detected between the young and old groups (Fig. 1b). However, the old macaques reached their peak earlier, at 10 or 14 dpi, compared with the delayed peak at 14 or 21 dpi in the young macaques (P = 0.0154) (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, in contrast to the survivors, the macaques that died displayed a more robust viral replication as indicated by higher viral loads from 35 dpi to death (Supplementary Fig. S2). Because chronic diarrhea induced by increased intestinal permeability occurred during the progression of SIV infection24, it is conceivable that old ChRM may have a higher risk of rapid progression of AIDS.\n",

Moreover, compared with the young macaques, the old ChRM had a more pronounced and a more proportional reduction of CCR5+CD4+ memory T cells relative to the pre-infection level. This result is further supported by a previous finding that SIVmac239 preferentially infects CCR5+CD4+ memory T cells and induces the rapid depletion of CD4+ central memory T cells27 (Fig. 2c). B cells were depleted quickly and to a great extent both in young and old macaques during only the acute phase (Fig. 2d). No statistically significant changes were detected in CD8+ T cells over time, although the old ChRM had more CD8+ T cells than did the young macaques (Supplementary Fig. S3).",

In our study, the plasma viral loads in old ChRM were also at a moderate peak and low set-point level during early infection and rapidly rose to peak levels and remained high as the infection progressed.

Furthermore, old ChRM had a low level of B cells, as is also seen in chronic HIV-1infection6. Because fewer CD4+ T cells and B cells and the inversion of CD4/CD8 are strong predictors of mortality and morbidity in old individuals9, it is not surprising that old ChRM showed a high risk of fast progression during early infection.",

Because the increased Ki67 expression might reflect the proliferation of cells entering an activated state, studies have suggested that elevated Ki67 expression in T cells is associated with an increased risk of AIDS in both HIV-1- and SIV-infected individuals31\u201333. Furthermore, a previous report has demonstrated that the expression of Ki67 is elevated in peripheral na\u00efve T cells from old rhesus macaques, thus partially representing a dramatic increase in homeostatic turnover and a loss of the na\u00efve T-cell pool34. Together with the decrease in na\u00efve lymphocytes in old ChRM and the strong association between Ki67+ na\u00efve T cells and disease progression, these observations suggest that the na\u00efve lymphocytes in old ChRM have a rapid turnover and exhaustion, thereby probably contributing to disease progression.",

Thus, a na\u00efve T-cell subset may play an important role in delaying HIV progression35\u201337. In our study, the low frequency of na\u00efve T cells before infection in ChRM predicted a robust immune activation and rapid SIV progression. Moreover, in accordance with the robust turnover in the na\u00efve subset, the rapid decrease in na\u00efve CD4+ T cell and na\u00efve B cell numbers that was induced by SIVmac239 infection in old ChRM may have contributed to the gradual absence of their immune defense. Similarly to what has been shown in elderly individuals, there is some evidence that direct HIV infection and HIV-induced immune activation destroy the microenvironments supporting immune renewal, reduce the thymic and myeloid output and finally, result in the disruption of normal immune homeostasis and the loss of na\u00efve lymphocytes in the periphery38\u201340. Our data demonstrated that old ChRM exhibited an SIV-induced decrease of thymic and myeloid output after 2 months post-infection. In fact, in the chronic stage, SIV infection induced a deep impairment of immune homeostasis, thus resulting in a scarcity of na\u00efve T cells in the peripheral blood of old ChRM (unpublished data).",

            "text": "The gene expression data from old ChRM displayed a rapid, strong and persistent interferon and pathogen recognition response to SIVmac239. Notably, distinct from nonpathogenic SIV infection with a transient elevated expression of ISGs in the acute phase, the expression of ISGs is persistently higher in HIV-infected individuals and SIVmac239-infected macaques29, 41. This phenomenon was also seen in the young and especially in the old ChRM. Other studies have also found that most ISGs are significantly elevated in old rhesus macaques infected with various viruses such as H1N1 and SARS-CoV. This elevation is due to the highly activated upstream NF-\u03baB transcription factor, primarily because of increased viral replication and inflammation18, 19. Recent studies have demonstrated that a sufficient type I interferon (IFN-I) response during acute infection suppresses the depletion of CD4+ T cells, SIV transmission and active HSCs. However, the persistent activation of the IFN response after acute SIV infection may functionally impair HSCs with hematopoietic defects and decrease the protection from viruses caused by IFN desensitization42, 43. Interestingly, SOCS1, which encodes a member of cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling that act as modulators of IFN-\u03b3 action (ENTREZ gene summary), was slightly induced by SIVmac239 in ChRM but was quickly down-regulated in old macaques. Specifically, IFNB1 expression was highly induced in young ChRM and may have partially prevented the depletion of CD4+ T cells. As a corollary to the above, and in line with the negative correlation between ISG expression and na\u00efve lymphocyte number, it is possible that the IFN response plays a key role in the initiation of the anti-viral program and the homeostatic proliferation that compensates for the massive depletion of na\u00efve lymphocytes. However, the uncontrolled and highly activated IFN response may finally induce anergy in the IFN signal and silence the antiviral activity in the hosts.",

Because they are associated with the up-regulation of MYD88, IRF7, IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2, these genes can activate signaling cascades and lead to the activation of the NF-\u03baB and IFN-I responses44\u201348. However, the highly significant defect in the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production in monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and in the pDC-induced functional activity of CD8+ T cells observed in the elderly may result from decreased TLR surface expression and dysfunctional IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)49\u201351. Thus, integrating the contradictory findings, we suspect that immunosenescence contributes to the sensitivity to SIVmac239 and causes a high level of viral replication, which in turn elevates the host response and immune activation and ultimately accelerates disease progression in old ChRM. However, to make the best use of PBMC resources, we selected only the 6 old macaques with higher PBMC numbers and compared their gene expression levels with those in the 6 young animals. Therefore, our study may only partially reflect the relationships between gene expression and other parameters. Moreover, the T cell-specific chemokine RANTES, which plays an important role in sustaining CD8 T cell responses52, is markedly induced in old ChRM and associates with the homeostatic proliferation of T cells. Thus, it may be an effective marker for disease progression in old patients infected with HIV.",

Simultaneously, this process induces the robust proliferation of na\u00efve T cells and the host response to compensate for the severe exhaustion of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells (Fig. 7b). However, the persistent immune activation and lack of immune regulation in old ChRM eventually leads to increased immunosenescence and accelerated disease progression that first prompts these events. In conclusion, aging results in increased disease severity after SIV infection, even before the chronic phase. In addition, old ChRM may serve as an excellent model for elderly HIV-infected people and may thus promote research relating to the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS and aimed at identifying therapeutic strategies for elderly patients.",
