            "text": "Pulmonary fibrosis, a severe pathological outcome associated with several lung diseases, can be commonly reproduced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. The tissue remodeling that ensues is characterized by severe inflammation (evident from edema and leukocyte migration) and a delayed phase with fibroblast proliferation and excess matrix deposition [1]. The pathological events leading to pulmonary fibrosis have been attributed to an overproduction of interstitial collagens by cytokine-activated fibroblasts [2]; moreover, though a variety of cytokines have been implicated in fibroblast activation, a paramount causative role for transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 has emerged. This cytokine activates fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts [3] and stimulates extracellular matrix (ECM) production [4]. However, besides its pro-fibrotic properties, TGF-\u03b21 exerts a number of other homeostatic functions in immune and cancer biology [5], so that inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 would provoke a series of adverse effects, making it not that valuable as a therapeutic approach. Other therapeutic interventions include anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. glucocorticoids as prednisone) that are effective to relieve disease without halting fibrosis progression. Anti-fibrotic drugs do not improve lung function or life expectancy and their use may also be associated with harmful side effects [6]. Nonetheless, our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis is increased, and this might help for the identification of targets amenable for the development of novel therapies [7].",

Most of these studies have focused on acute inflammation, elucidating endogenous anti-inflammatory pathways that operate in parallel, and sometimes in a time-delayed fashion, to the more widely studied pro-inflammatory mediators, to ensure rapid resolution of the host response with return to tissue homeostasis [9]. One line of research has focused on the glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin A1 (AnxA1; 346 amino acids long; 37 kDa protein), a potent modulator of leukocyte trafficking/transmigration in acute and chronic inflammation [10,11], with a particular ability to inhibit the leukocyte/endothelium interaction in the microvasculature [12]. Characterization of an AnxA1 null mouse colony has revealed, upon stimulation, a dysregulation of pathophysiological mechanisms, with an exacerbation of acute and chronic experimental inflammatory responses [12-15].",

The AnxA1 anti-inflammatory effects can be replicated by a shorter peptide spanning the first 25 amino acids, termed peptide Ac2-26. Both AnxA1 and its N-terminal derived peptides exert potent regulation of the inflammatory reaction by activating its receptor, the formyl-peptide receptor (FPR) [19-21], with consequent inhibition of white blood cell trafficking and promotion of efferocytosis [22,23]. Of interest in the context of lung inflammation, down-regulation of endogenous AnxA1 expression has been noted in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of cystic fibrosis patients [24]. More recently, blockade of the transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) led to the release of AnxA1 from human and mouse neutrophils, a finding associated with an altered acute inflammatory reaction [25].",

Few studies in humans and animals have demonstrated down regulation of one endogenous effector of resolution, the protein AnxA1, during the development of cystic fibrosis [24,25]; the present study was intended to address, for the first time, the potential relevance of AnxA1 in experimental fibrosis using the recently generated AnxA1 null mouse [14,15].",

At day 21 post-bleomycin, the X-Gal staining detected higher Anxa1 gene promoter activity in leukocytes and epithelial cells compared to day 0 lung tissue samples. These data, together with the AnxA1 protein expression, indicate that despite the lower levels of AnxA1 detected in the cells, there is ample Anxa1 gene promoter activity; we wish to postulate that reduction in AnxA1 protein may be associated with a post-transcriptional mechanism(s) which could perhaps lead to AnxA1 proteolysis or leakage (aberrant secretion) from the cells. AnxA1 lacks a signal peptide yet it is released from cells (e.g. activated PMN; see ref. 31). Several non-canonical secretory pathways have been ascribed, possibly in a cell specific fashion, including phosphorylation [32], proteolysis [24,33], granule/membrane fusion [34] and microparticles release [35]. Future studies will attempt to establish the 'preferred' mode of AnxA1 secretion in activated lung cells, though it cannot be excluded that alternative mechanisms might be operating in diseased cells.",

In pathology, AnxA1 has been implicated directly or indirectly in tumor cell growth [41,42]. Our previous results also showed an abnormal growth formation in the AnxA1 null mice skull, probably caused by increased extracellular matrix and a delay in the bone mineralization [43]. Thus, we would postulate that absence of AnxA1 may lead to higher cell proliferation, increasing the extracellular matrix production and fibrosis formation.

The combined effect of AnxA1 absence and bleomycin-induced fibrosis exceeded the sum of the effects of each factor alone on the severity of histological changes. This was visible because the higher degree of activation of circulating leukocyte and a remarkable leukocyte infiltration to the alveolar space and lung parenchyma; these cellular events led, or at least contribute, to: i) a more severe inflammatory response and ii) a greater destruction of alveolar architecture, pronounced in the perivascular and peribronchial areas. This effect is in line with our previous data in different experimental models of inflammation, including acute peritonitis [13] and lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation [12]. Absence of AnxA1 is conducive to increased leukocyte infiltration leading to a more severe inflammatory reaction. Several studies have associated inflammatory cell recruitment and lung damage with fibrosis formation [7,45], prompting us to propose that alteration in the early protective role of AnxA1 during the inflammatory phase could lead, downstream, to a higher degree of fibrosis.",

Analysis of cytokine content favors a functional association between these two readouts. In fact, tightly coupled to the early inflammatory response is a higher cytokine expression. We measured TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b3 since they instrumental for the inflammatory process and/or fibrosis [46,47]. In wild type mice, levels of these cytokines changed in the blood and BAL fluid samples. TGF-\u03b21 is largely responsible for fibroblast activation/differentiation, as well as collagen over-expression [3]. Furthermore, a lower degree of parenchymal inflammation has been observed in IFN-\u03b3 deficient mice subjected to the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model [45]. In our samples we could determine a correlation between increased levels of TGF-\u03b21 with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 up-regulation. Hardie and collaborators [48] showed that TGF-\u03b21 conditional over-expression in epithelial cells, endothelial cells and macrophages induces fibrosis and TNF-\u03b1 expression even in the absence of inflammation. It is plausible that complex positive loops might be activated locally, since TGF-\u03b21 induction from macrophages occurs in a two-stage process requiring both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-13 [49].",

Such a model is congruent with a recent study in mouse colitis, which revealed the ability of treatment with peptide Ac2-26 to increase tissue mRNA for AnxA1 receptors [44]. The same held true for epithelial cells treated with AnxA1 [52]. Therefore, different studies are coming together with indications for the existence of this positive loop; if extended to other settings; this would indicate possible \"auto-reactivity\" of endogenous anti-inflammation and resolution, at least with respect to the AnxA1 pathway.",
