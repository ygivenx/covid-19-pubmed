Pneumonia is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide.

            "text": "In this study, the most prevalent pathogen was RSV A/B. It was detected in 53% of samples. According to several studies, RSV (A and B) is known as the most common cause of pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide [25]. Hall CB et al. suggest that RSV has the greatest disease burden both in hospitalized children and in outpatients, especially in children under 5 years of age [26]. This higher proportion in infants is due to maternal antibodies that are ineffective in preventing RSV infections [24]. A systematic review realized by Shi et al. in 2015 estimated that 30 million episodes of acute lower respiratory infection caused by RSV were about a third in the first year of the life among children aged less than 4 years in low-income and middle-income countries. They also estimated 2.8 million episodes in high-income countries [27]. The second virus detected in the study was RV with 23%. The human RV is the most frequent causative agents of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and the main causative agents of the common cold. It causes severe ARIs in infants and young children [28, 29]. ADV was detected in 2% of cases; it is one of the major causes of lower respiratory tract infection in children aged more than 2 years and in adults, but rarely in newborns and infants [30]. Influenza A accounted for 4% of virus-detection-positive samples. According to the results of a study published in Morocco by Ezzine et al. during both seasons (2016/2017-2017/2018), influenza infections in ARIs cases affects especially adults aged more than 65 years (20.7%) and children aged between 5 and 15 years (36%), while children aged less than two years had a low rate (4.4%) [31]. The IV is known for its seasonal outbreaks of ARI during a few weeks in winter [29]. According to a study realized in Brazil by Canela et al., among children aged between 0 and 18 years, the virus positivity is higher with frequency of IV H1N1 (38%) [32]. PIV subtype 4 was detected in 2% of our cases, and it has been reported to be a much less frequent cause of ARIs [33]. The group of coronavirus is heterogeneous (HCoV 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) [34]. In our study, we detected only Cor229E. The clinical symptoms of coronavirus and other newly discovered viruses involved in RTIs (human bocavirus and hMPV) are similar to the other respiratory viruses and are recognized frequently at young age [13]. Our results are similar to those of other studies conducted among children and infants [35, 36]. Our etiological results coincide with those of a study realized at Toulouze University Hospital among children suffering from ARIs; there samples were analyzed using the RespiFinder 15 assay, the prevalence of virus was 88.7% and the RSV was the most frequently detected 39.5% [9]. Regarding bacteria, only 6% of our patients had Mycoplasma pneumoniae, while 81% of the cases have been treated with antibiotic. The low prevalence of bacteria may be explained by the use of antibiotics as an urgent act used in cases suspected with ARTs. Beckmann and Hirsch detected Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2.1% among pediatric and adult patients [36].",

Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al. reported that the molecular assays revealed a high frequency of double infections. Specifically, coronaviruses (75%), RSV (58%), and RV (46%) were frequently detected as mixed infection [8]. The current study shows coinfection in 31% of positive samples, with a high frequency in the combinations between RSV/rhino and RSV/Cor229E. Several studies had pointed out that clinical severity is associated with coinfection with more than one virus [8, 37, 38]. Another study reported that coinfection was not associated with an increase in the clinical severity [39]. Our results did not show a significant difference in clinical severity between coinfection and single infection. Also, clinical presentation of different causative agents was often similar. The association of viral detection with clinical characteristics shows a predominance of respiratory signs specially (dyspnea, polypnea, cyanosis, labored breathing, wheezing, and Rhonch). Our clinical symptoms and signs concurred with those of the study realized by Singh S et al. among infants aged less than 2 months [40].",

Multiplex RT-PCR assays for respiratory infections are not used in routine diagnosis in Morocco. Their use in the near future may help pediatricians choose an appropriate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, stop their use in patients infected with virus, initiate antiviral therapy and preserve intestinal flora, and help to decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization, which would also decrease management costs. Multiplex RT-PCR assays for respiratory infections are likely to be the subject of future studies on larger samples and different age groups.",
