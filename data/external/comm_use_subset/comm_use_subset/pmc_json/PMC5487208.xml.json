Recent deep-sequencing studies of human clinical samples suggest that influenza accumulates relatively limited genetic diversity within hosts during most acute infections (Dinis et al., 2016; Poon et al., 2016; Sobel Leonard et al., 2016; Debbink et al., 2017), in line with earlier studies in dogs and horses (Murcia et al., 2010; Hoelzer et al., 2010). Some within-host mutations may confer novel antigenic properties (Dinis et al., 2016), but most lack clear functional interpretation. Altogether, it remains unclear how influenza\u2019s within-host diversity is transformed into global evolution.",

These mutations fluctuate in frequency but rarely fix, showing that complex evolutionary dynamics can emerge within single infected individuals (Figure 2B, Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20135). We focused on within-host mutations that reached a frequency of at least 5% in two independent sequencing replicates from any patient sample. Many nonsynonymous mutations occur at sites that affect the antigenicity of HA (Koel et al., 2013) and the antiviral sensitivity of NA (Baz et al., 2006; van der Vries et al., 2013) (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6). In NA in particular, we observe the emergence and persistence of mutations T242I and R292K, which are known to be associated with oseltamivir resistance (Baz et al., 2006; van der Vries et al., 2013), a phenomenon of strong clinical importance (Renaud et al., 2011) (Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20135).",

Not all sites are expected to tolerate mutation, so we also performed simulations where we only considered sites for which there was variation in human H3N2 influenza globally between 2000 and 2015: for instance, in HA about 25% of codon sites show no variation within the GISAID database. We found significant parallelism in HA (p<0.01), but not in NA or in the rest of the genome (p>0.05) when we consider all sites of global variation.

In particular, four of the five sites of recurrent within-host mutation in HA are also sites of global influenza variation (Figure 4, Figure 4\u2014source data 1). The V223I and N225D mutations arise in multiple patients, and then fix globally in the decade after the patient infections (Figure 4D). Mutations also reach high global frequencies at sites 138 and 193, although the F193 and S193 variants that spread globally differ from the Y193 variant that arises within our patients. However, the concordance is incomplete. Mutation L427F reaches a frequency of >75% in three patients but is rare or nonexistent in influenza globally (Figure 4D), suggesting that this mutation may have within-host benefits that are not reflected in global evolution. But overall across hemagglutinin, within-host variants tend to arise at sites that vary on the global scale.",

Another previous study used hemagglutination inhibition assays to show that antigenic drift of influenza within an immunocompromised patient resembled global antigenic change (McMinn et al., 1999). These similarities further support our finding that influenza evolution shows parallelism across diverse patients.",

For instance, one recent study deep-sequenced HA from several hundred patients but only found a small number of antigenic variants, and mostly at low frequencies (Dinis et al., 2016). But our study suggests that influenza may experience many of the same selective pressures within acute infections as it does globally, even if the short durations of these infections make it difficult for selected mutations to reach frequencies that are detectable with current methods. We suggest that within-host viral diversity may act as a noisy early measurement of global viral evolution, shaped by some of the same immunological and evolutionary constraints. As high-throughput sequencing continues to improve, detailed characterization of within-host variation will be increasingly valuable for understanding how molecular, immunological, and epidemiological forces interact to shape viral evolution.",

We calculated the number of unique sites of mutation among all four patients in this simulated data set, and we compared this distribution to the number of unique sites observed in our sequencing data: fewer unique sites of mutation indicates more parallelism (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7A). This null model is overly simplistic, since some sites in a protein experience more evolutionary constraint. To estimate this constraint, we limited the number of sites considered mutable to the sites that show at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 population between 2000 and 2015 (see Analysis of Global Variation) (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7B).

(B) Distribution of overlapping sites for simulations as described in (A), but with a constrained null model in which the fraction of sites considered mutable is the fraction that shows at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 influenza population between 2000 and 2015 (see Materials and methods) to account for constraints on protein evolution. For both HA and NA, the observed overlap of mutations between patients is statistically significant under this set of constraints. (C) p-values as described in (A), calculated across a range of constraints on the fraction of mutable sites. The constrained null model indicated in (B) is indicated with a red arrow. For both HA and NA, the observed parallelism is statistically significant at a threshold of 0.05 unless it is assumed that fewer than 15% of the sites in HA or 35% of the sites in NA are mutable.

(B) Frequencies of haplotypes at HA sites 193 and 225 in patient X. Evolutionary paths from the ancestral to double-mutant state are shown, with haplotypes colored according to their maximum frequency during the infection. Solid black lines connect pairs of haplotypes that are both present at a frequency of above 1% and that unambiguously occurred through the indicated mutation. Dashed lines indicate that multiple mutations could have produced a particular haplotype.

We mixed equal volumes of extracted RNA from the first influenza-positive nasal washes from patients W and X and prepared replicate libraries for sequencing as described in Materials and methods. In the absence of PCR recombination, all haplotypes should consist entirely of bases from one or the other original sample: for instance, 00000000 or 11111111. Based on sequencing of the unmixed samples from patients W and X, we identified eight sites of fixed differences within a 200 bp region of the HA gene, and we inferred haplotypes in the mixture sample at these eight sites. Beginning at the first haplotype site, we tallied the proportion of haplotypes that had experienced recombination by each successive site in the haplotype. We did not seek to distinguish between PCR recombination and sequencing errors: the haplotypes 00100000 and 00111111 were both recorded as having experienced recombination by the third haplotype site. The maximum-frequency recombinant haplotype never exceeded 3.5% of the total haplotypes. DOI:\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26875.015",

We calculated the overlap between the two sets of sites in each simulation as a metric of parallelism: greater overlap means that more parallelism has occurred.
