            "text": "Respiratory viruses first infect nasal epithelial cells which triggers an antiviral response. This response is driven by type I (\u03b1/\u03b2) and III (\u03bb) interferons (IFN) that are induced following recognition of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are cell surface and endosomal PRRs, whilst the RNA helicase receptors (RIG-I and MDA-5) and NOD-like receptors (NOD2), detect viral RNA in the cytoplasm. Signalling via the PRRs activates transcription factors (IRF-3, IRF-7, NF-\u03baB), which lead to the production and secretion of type I and III IFN. The IFNs then bind to cell surface receptors to activate a separate pathway leading to the production of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) which encode antiviral proteins that combat infection, as well as PRRs and transcriptional factors which further amplify IFN production. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human meta-pneumovirus (hMPV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) are all single stranded RNA viruses but engage differently with cell signalling pathways. In airway epithelial cells RSV and hMPV RNA are primarily detected by RIG-I in the cytoplasm [14,15]. RSV can also be detected by NOD2 [16]. HRV is endocytosed by epithelial cells, and is therefore primarily detected by TLR3 in the endosome early in the infection process and by RIG-I and MDA-5 later in infection following upregulation of these PRRs [17]. The fusion (F) protein of RSV is recognised by TLR4 at the epithelial cell surface [18].",

Subsequent  in vitro  infection of primary airway epithelial cells from asthmatic and healthy adults with HRV have demonstrated that asthmatic cells produce less IFN-\u03b2 [21] and IFN-\u03bb [22] making them potentially more susceptible to infection, slower to clear infection, and more susceptible to virus-induced cell cytotoxicity. Deficiencies in the IFN-\u03b1 response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells from asthmatic adults and children has also been observed, in these particular studies, in response to RSV, HRV [14,15] and Influenza A [23]. It is likely that the overall impaired innate immune response of the asthmatic airway epithelium is a result of deficiencies in the antiviral response of both epithelial cells and immune cells. Childhood, especially infancy, is characterized by developmentally-regulated deficiencies in innate and adaptive immunity [24]. Such deficiencies are likely to increase the risk of viral LRI in children, especially in those at high risk for asthma and allergies.",

            "text": "Each year, at the end of summer, parents of asthmatic children are concerned about acute asthma exacerbations following a common cold, asking how to minimize the risk during the winter viral season. It is a valid concern as up to 70% of asthmatic children have an intermittent or wheeze which is mostly symptomatic after viral infections [25,26]. Asthmatics with exacerbation-prone phenotype are susceptible to acute exacerbations requiring hospitalization or an unscheduled visit for medical attention. Major risk factors for acute exacerbations include previous acute exacerbation, allergy, young age, poorly controlled asthma, and, in particular, viral respiratory infections. Moreover, recent data suggests an interaction between allergies and viral infections occurs to increase the risk of asthma exacerbation [27]. Acute exacerbations are associated with decreased lung growth or accelerated loss of lung function and, as such, add substantially to both the cost and morbidity associated with asthma [28,29]. Viral respiratory infections are the main cause of asthma exacerbations in children (80-85%) and are a major risk factor for admission in hospital every autumn [30-32]. HRV are the most common viral agents [33]; Other respiratory tract viruses detected in children with an asthma exacerbation include RSV, influenza, coronavirus, hMPV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and bocavirus [34-36]. Current drugs for the prevention and treatment of virus-induced exacerbation of asthma are poorly effective and novel alternative therapies are needed.",

            "text": "Much research interest has focused on the potential role respiratory viral infections play in the inception of asthma. It is well established that hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis is a risk factor for asthma during childhood [37,38]. Epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of asthma with LRI caused by HRV. In the Childhood Origin of Asthma (COAST) birth cohort study, wheezing with RSV (odds ratio [OR], 2.6), HRV (OR, 9.8), or both HRV and RSV (OR, 10) was associated with increased asthma risk at age six years [7]. The Childhood Asthma Study (CAS) in Perth, Australia showed that wheezing with HRV or RSV in the first year of life was a risk factor (OR, 2.5) for current wheeze at five years of age [4]. Infant birth about four months before the winter virus peak carried the highest risk of developing asthma compared with birth 12 months before the peak [39]. The risk of asthma is increased by severe LRI (sLRI), especially in the presence of allergic sensitization in early life [4,25]. There appears to be a synergistic interaction between viral infection and allergic sensitization, suggesting a \u201ctwo hit\u201d model for induction of persistent asthma. These data also provide a series of novel strategies for the primary prevention of asthma by prevention of either allergic sensitization or of sLRI in high risk children. This strategy is also supported in a study by Simoes et al. [40], in which the use of palivizumab to prevent RSV infection decreased the risk of recurrent wheezing in nonatopic premature infants.",

Pulmonary inflammation resulting from atopy and sLRI occurring during this vulnerable time is hypothesized to perturb underlying tissue differentiation programs, resulting in deleterious long term effects on respiratory functions. As a result, there is widespread belief amongst the paediatric respiratory community that intervention measures that can lower the frequency and/or intensity of sLRI in early life amongst the high risk atopic subgroup of children are likely to be successful at preventing asthma. If successful, these strategies would have major implications for reducing the high impact of this chronic disease on the community [17,41,42].",

Vitamin A derivatives are involved in the regulation of the immune system and tissue inflammation as well as prevention of respiratory infections [71]. Zinc, selenium and other trace elements are necessary for function of both innate and adaptive immune function. A high intake of fruit and vegetables ensures adequate consumption of nutrients and antioxidants and appears to be beneficial for asthma. Although recent reviews have shown that zinc [72], garlic [73], Echinacea purpurea [74] or Ginseng [75] supplementation for several months may reduce cold incidence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend any vitamin or mineral supplementation in the management of asthmatic children without nutrient deficiency [76,77]. However, a large controlled trial showed Echinacea was ineffective in reducing infection rate or symptom severity of HRV infection in healthy young adult volunteers [78]. Vitamin C supplementation failed to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population except in those exposed to short periods of extreme physical stress [79]. Finally, it is worth remembering that infants who are not breastfed have significantly higher risk of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other infections, as breast milk is a biologically active substance containing antimicrobial and immunomodulatory elements [80-82].",

Common mucosal immunity describes the phenomenon where immune cells, especially regulatory T-cells, traffic to and influence responses at other mucosal surfaces, including the lungs [99].

In the first year of life, especially the first few weeks, the microbiota of the newborn is highly variable during this critical time of post-natal maturation of the immune system. Microbiota is shaped by genetic and environmental factors including: mode of delivery, neonates born by means of vaginal delivery are exposed to mothers gut, skin, and vaginal flora [104]; breast feeding and diet [105]; farm or urban living [106]; vitamin D status [107]; and antibiotic consumption [98,108]. This knowledge stimulated interest in the use of probiotics and prebiotics as the intentional introduction or encouragement of specific microbes to shape immune system development. Specifically, the microbiota can activate distinct tolerogenic dendritic cells in the gut and through this interaction can drive regulatory T-cell differentiation that modulates both Th1 and Th2 responses inside and outside the gut [109-111]. Probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders (viral and antibiotic-associated diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease) [112,113]. However, attempts to prevent or treat allergic disorders such as eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis have had inconsistent results [99,109,114-116].",

While the precise mechanisms are largely unknown, speculations include: probiotics compete against pathogens; increase the barrier function in respiratory epithelium; immunostimulatory effects by enhancing cellular immunity with increased activity of natural killer cells and macrophages in airways [117]. Probiotics reduce the frequency of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections in children who attend day care centres [118]. They have also been found to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory infections in healthy and hospitalized children, and reduce the duration of common cold symptoms [119-122].",

A recent Cochrane review of 14 randomised controlled trials showed that probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of episodes of acute upper respiratory infections (URIs) and reducing antibiotic use, while there were no differences in the mean duration of an episode and no increase in adverse events [125]. Probiotic foods such as probiotic milk or yogurt (functional foods) containing well-defined probiotic strains may reduce the risk of catching the common cold and represent a simple, safe, effective, available and affordable method for preventing respiratory infections in children [112,120,126-131].",

Entry of rhinovirus into normal epithelial cells initiates a vigorous innate immune response with IFN-\u03b2 secretion and apoptosis induction. In asthma, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb responses are impaired, resulting in viral replication, cell cytotoxicity, enhanced virion shedding and increased susceptibility to common cold [17,142]. Epithelial cells of asthmatic patients responded to exogenous treatment with IFN-\u03b2 exhibiting reduced rhinovirus release (Cakebread, Xu et al. 2011; Jackson, Sykes et al. 2011). If the proposed deficiency of type I and III contribute to asthma exacerbations [21,22,143], correcting this deficiency with exogenous interferons would be a logical approach. The advantages of interferon application include the broad spectrum of activity with low risk of resistance development [47]. Prophylactic intranasal recombinant IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 have been shown to be effective against rhinovirus infection in humans [144-146]. The results of these clinical trials are awaited with interest [147,148]. However, the systemic symptoms associated with severe viral infections, e.g. influenza, are associated with interferons, so careful dosing may be required. Considering the occurrence of the local side effects, neutropenia and cost, the use of long-term prophylaxis with daily, intranasal administration of interferons is not feasible [144]. However, randomized clinical trials using similar strategies are currently underway in adults with chronic respiratory disease and the results are keenly awaited.",

Recent reports suggest that vitamin D might play a role in the recent increase in allergic disease [155-157]. Vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with a higher incidence of respiratory tract infection, wheezing illness in children [158], reduced asthma control [159], emergency department visits, severe asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations [70,160]. In a recent study of 48 children from five to 18 years of age, with newly diagnosed asthma, vitamin D supplementation during the northern hemisphere winter months (September to July) prevented declining serum concentrations of 25(OH) D and reduced the risk of asthma exacerbation triggered by acute respiratory tract infections [161].",

In early life, they contribute to the inception of asthma and are responsible for most of the acute exacerbations for asthma in childhood. While the debate is not completely settled, children at high risk of developing asthma and those with established asthma may be at increased risk of acquiring respiratory viral infections and may be less able to contain these to the upper airway. Several simple general strategies can be used to help prevent respiratory viral infections in asthmatic children (Table 2), with good personal hygiene, hand-washing and avoidance of cigarette smoke likely to reduce respiratory viral infections. General immuno-stimulatory strategies, such as eating a healthy balanced diet, active probiotic supplements and bacterial-derived products, e.g. OM-85, may reduce recurrent infections in susceptible children.",
