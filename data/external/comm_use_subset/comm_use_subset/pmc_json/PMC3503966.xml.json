Passive antibody therapy has been successfully used to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV [2]\u2013[4], and to confer protection against lethal challenge in experimental animals [5]. Re-emergence of SARS in humans remains a credible health threat because of the animal reservoirs [6]\u2013[9]. As of now, there is no effective treatment for SARS. However, since virus titer peaks 10 days post-infection [1], [10], post-exposure treatment that is effective against a broad spectrum of viral variants remains a viable option. Many of the reported HmAbs against SARS-CoV fail to neutralize all of the clinical isolates [11]\u2013[13]. Therefore, there is a need for a clinically usable therapy against SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "The Spike (S) glycoprotein plays an essential role in receptor binding and membrane fusion critical for the virus entry, and contains epitopes that elicit neutralizing Abs [14]\u2013[17]. The SARS-CoV S protein consists of two functional domains, S1 (amino acids 12\u2013680) and S2 (amino acids 681\u20131255) [18]. The receptor binding domain (RBD) (amino acids 318\u2013510) contained within the S1 domain is required for binding to ACE-2 receptor on the cell surface and is thought to contain the majority of neutralizing epitopes [14], [19], [20]. Co-crystallization of the RBD and human ACE-2 identified the receptor binding motif (RBM) (amino acids 424\u2013494) in direct contact with ACE2 [18]. The S2 domain contains the fusion peptide followed by two conserved heptad repeats (i.e. HR1 and HR2), which upon cleavage by cathepsin-L associate to form a fusion core [15], [18], [21]\u2013[23], and facilitate fusion with the cell membrane required for the virus entry [24]. Synthetic HR2 peptides as well as HR2 specific antibodies have been shown to block SARS-CoV infection [25]\u2013[27]. The RBD shows high rates of mutation which allows the virus to escape neutralization by Abs without losing its ability to infect cells [13], [28]. In contrast, the S2 domain is highly conserved among different clinical isolates of the SARS-CoV [29], [30], and thus raise the possibility that Abs against this region may confer better protection against a broad spectrum of clinical isolates.",

Interestingly, analyses of the amino acid sequences of the S protein of 94 SARS-CoV clinical isolates revealed no mutations that are localized to HR1, and only K1163E mutation in the HR2 of six isolates (i.e. SZ3, GZ0402, HSZ-Cb, SZ16, A022, and GZ02), and Q1183R and Q1183K mutations in the HR2 of BJ182-12 and GZ-C isolates respectively.

This is further substantiated in the current study by the loss of neutralization by different RBD binding antibodies due to a single mutation in the S protein. However, HR1 and HR2 regions contain highly conserved neutralization epitopes in which mutations are likely lethal due to their critical role in the membrane fusion required for virus entry. Consequently, as shown by our results, the HR1 and HR2 specific antibodies can neutralize a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV variants with very limited potential, if any, for the emergence of escape mutants, especially when they are used in combination.",

Combining the S1 binding 4D4 HmAb with either 1F8 (HR1) or 5E9 (HR2) resulted in increased virus neutralization of the mutants Sin845, GZ-C and GZ0402 compared to the individual HmAbs. Failure of the 4D4/1F8, 4D4/5E9 and 1F8/5E9 combinations to increase GD01 pseudovirus inhibition, when compared to the inhibition seen either with 5E9 or 1F8 alone, was likely due to enhanced binding and neutralization of this virus by these HmAbs when used individually. However, a combination comprising of HmAbs 4D4, 1F8 and 5E9 showed further significant increase in virus neutralization compared to each of the individual HmAbs or any of the pairs. These results suggested that the use of a cocktail consisting of HmAbs that can bind to different conserved regions of the S protein may be more desirable for therapeutic use against SARS-CoV infection. This speculation is supported by earlier studies that have shown that it is far more difficult to select for viral variants in the presence of either a polyclonal neutralizing antibody or a cocktail of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies [36], [38]\u2013[40].",

SARS-CoV S protein is a class I fusion protein that contains HR1 and HR2 regions [16], which are highly conserved. Presence of similar structures in many other class I viral fusion proteins [42], point to a common fusion mechanism used by different viruses. Therefore, monoclonal antibodies against such conserved regions might constitute the most effective passive therapy. Our findings are not only relevant to designing a highly effective passive therapy for SARS-CoV but have implications for the development of passive therapy for other viral infections including influenza and HIV [38], [39], [43].",
