            "text": "Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality,[1] and is associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Within the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I to the vasoconstrictor and pro-atherosclerotic peptide Ang II,[2] whilst ACE2 is an endogenous inhibitor of the RAS through its major action to degrade Ang II.[3] ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart and blood vessels[4] and is cleaved from the cell surface to release the catalytically active ectodomain[5] into the circulation through the action of tumour necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE).[6] In human myocardium, ACE2 is localized to the endothelium of the microcirculation,[7] and is also present in the media of atherosclerotic radial arteries.[8] In healthy individuals, circulating ACE2 activity levels are low[9, 10] but increase in the presence of CV disease or risk factors including heart failure (HF),[11] atrial fibrillation (AF),[12] kidney disease[13, 14] and type 1 diabetes.[15] To date, there is limited information on the prognostic role of circulating ACE2 activity levels and the results are conflicting. For example, increased ACE2 activity predicted adverse CV outcomes in heart failure,[16] but not in patients after emergency orthopedic surgery[17] or with chronic kidney disease.[13, 14] These differences may reflect the patient population, the relative cardiovascular risk of the patient population or the length of follow up. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of plasma ACE2 activity levels to predict CV events in a high-risk cohort of patients with angiographically proven obstructive CAD with more than 10 years of follow-up.",

Plasma ACE2 activity was measured within 2 years after all samples were collected. Samples were batched and ACE2 assays were run over a period of 2 days. The catalytic activity of ACE2 was measured using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay as previously described.[9] Briefly, plasma (0.25 ml) was diluted into low-ionic-strength buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.5) and added to 200 \u03bcl ANXSepharose 4 Fast-Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) that removed a previously characterized endogenous inhibitor of ACE2 activity.[9] After binding and washing, the resulting eluate was assayed for ACE2 catalytic activity. Duplicate samples were incubated with the ACE2-specific quenched fluorescent substrate, with or without 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The rate of substrate cleavage was determined by comparison to a standard curve of the free fluorophore, 4-amino-methoxycoumarin (MCA; Sigma, MO, USA) and expressed as \u03c1mole of substrate cleaved/mL of plasma/min. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation was 5.6 and 11.8% respectively.",
