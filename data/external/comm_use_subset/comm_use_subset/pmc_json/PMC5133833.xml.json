IFN-\u03b1 exerts its anticancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting cell apoptosis, and/or suppressing oncogene expression [4,5,6,7,8,9]. IFN-\u03b1 has been increasingly used in clinics to treat a wide range of malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), malignant melanoma, and renal cell cancer (RCC) [10,11,12,13,14]. However, IFN-\u03b1 has been barely used in the treatment of cervical cancer either alone or in combination with other agents. Although cervical cancer is the leading threat to women\u2019s health worldwide, there is no cure to this disease at present [15,16]. Therefore, finding a novel and effective treatment for this disease is highly demanded and should be the direction of scientist\u2019s efforts.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is the basic physiological process of the body to eliminate either the damaged, aged, or mutated cells to maintain homeostasis of the body system [17,18,19,20]. Cell apoptotic signals can be generated from and transmitted through different cellular compartments such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or the death receptors on cell surfaces [21,22]. Although induced by different means, apoptosis is primarily executed by a family of proteases known as the caspases (cysteinyl, aspartate-specific proteases), and among them the activation of caspase 3 is the hallmark of apoptosis. The apoptotic signal may target the outer membrane of mitochondria to increase membrane permeability, which in turn promotes the release of cytochrome c [22]. The apoptotic signal may be generated from the ER by various stresses in a caspase 4 dependent and independent manner. In addition, the membrane proximity-induced activations of caspases 8 and 10 release the respective cleaved caspase molecules within the cytoplasm [23,24,25,26]. Subsequently, the three pathways stimulate the common effectors (caspases 3, 6, and 7) to ultimately execute cell apoptosis.",

To test this hypothesis, the levels of glucose and lactate of HeLa cell culture medium after IFN-\u03b1 treatment were determined. Figure 1A,B show that the glucose level increased and lactate level decreased when the delivered doses of IFN-\u03b1 were enhanced, indicating that the proliferation potential of HeLa cells was inhibited. Consistently, IFN-\u03b1 treatment on HeLa cells resulted in a marked and dose-dependent reduction on the amount of viable cells, as demonstrated by both MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Figure 1C) and Cell-Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assays (Figure 1D).",

To test this possibility, HeLa cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 for 48 h and subjected to annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis showed a marked increase in the population of Annexin V+/PI\u2212 cells in response to a higher dose of IFN-\u03b1 delivery (Figure 2A), indicating that early apoptosis is induced upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Statistical analysis showed that a higher dose delivery of IFN-\u03b1 significantly increased the population of apoptotic cells (Figure 2B). To further define the optimal dose of IFN-\u03b1, HeLa cells were treated with six increasing doses (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng/mL) of IFN-\u03b1 for 48 h. Figure 2C shows that dose-dependent apoptosis was induced as the IFN-\u03b1 concentration increased from 0 to 50 ng/mL. The result also indicates that IFN-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis reaches a platform when the delivered dose of IFN-\u03b1 is more than 50 ng/mL. To further confirm this result, whole-cell lysates were prepared from these IFN-\u03b1-treated cells (depicted in Figure 2C) and probed with anti-caspase 3 and anti-cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies, then subjected to Western blot analysis. Figure 2D demonstrates that the increased delivery of IFN-\u03b1 significantly reduced the pre-caspase3 expressions and markedly increased the cleaved caspase 3 expressions, indicating that IFN-\u03b1-induced cell apoptosis indeed reaches a platform after 50 ng/mL. Based on the above information, we chose the concentration 100 ng/mL as the optimal dose for IFN-\u03b1 treatment in the experiments afterwards.",

To address this question directly, cell lysates prepared from IFN-\u03b1-treated HeLa cells were probed with anti-Bim, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-caspase 3, anti-cytochrome c, anti-PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1), and anti-cleaved-PARP1 antibodies. Bcl-xL belongs to the BCL2 family and exerts its anti-apoptotic function by preventing the oligomerization of Bax/Bak proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the other member of BCL2 family, Bim, has the opposite effect by promoting cell apoptosis [28]. Oligomeric Bax/Bak proteins that are inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane can cause alterations of membrane permeability and the release of cytochrome c, which eventually activates caspase 3 for executing cell apoptosis [29]. Indeed, IFN-\u03b1 treatment was observed to markedly enhance the expression level of Bim protein, dramatically inhibit the protein expression of Bcl-xL, and significantly activate caspase 3 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). In addition, a slight increase in the production of the cleaved PARP1 was also detected as the doses of IFN-\u03b1 increased (Figure 3A).",

As described earlier, the activation of caspases 8 and 10 can turn on the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, while human caspase 4 (equal to mouse caspase 12)\u2014localized on the cytoplasmic side of the ER outer membrane\u2014plays a major role in ER stress-mediated cell death [30,31]. Figure 4A shows that the increased doses of IFN-\u03b1 did not significantly alter the expression levels of caspases 8/10, while in contrast, caspases 8/10 could be activated by the combined effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 plus cycloheximide (CHX) in a TNF-\u03b1 dose-dependent manner. In addition, the activation of caspase 4 could be induced by increased doses of IFN-\u03b1 (Figure 4B), indicating that the caspase 4-related ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway, but not the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, may also contribute to IFN-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis in HeLa cells.",

Standard treatments such as ablation and cervical conization are the common strategies for early cervical cancer therapy, but are not recommended for high-risk HPV-infected patients [32]. In addition, most of the cervical cancer patients also receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy either solely or in combination. However, none of these approaches should of persistent HPV infection in the remaining cancer tissues after classic therapy [33]. More recently, the immunotherapy approach, with the help of immunomodulators, has attracted more attention, since this approach can enhance HPV-specific cellular immune responses that might be critical for eliminating HPV-specific neoplasia [16,34].
