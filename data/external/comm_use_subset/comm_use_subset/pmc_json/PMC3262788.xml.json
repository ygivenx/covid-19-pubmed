Computational gene prediction methods such as Glimmer [8] or GenMark [9] use Hidden Markov models which are based on a training set of well annotated genes. Although these methods are quite efficient, they often miss genes with anomalous nucleotide composition and have several well-described shortcomings: because bacterial genomes do not have introns, detecting gene boundaries is comparatively difficult; due to the usage of more than one start codon, computational genome annotation methods may predict overlapping ORFs [10]; prediction programs use arbitrary minimum cutoff lengths to filter short ORFs, which may lead to under-representation of small genes. In case of sRNA (small non-coding RNA) prediction, the lack of DNA sequence conservation, lack of a protein coding frame, and the limited accuracy of transcriptional signal prediction programs (promoter/Rho terminator prediction) confound computational prediction [11], [12].",

The genome has 2065 computationally predicted genes, of which 1980 are protein coding. We sequenced the transcriptome of H. somni using Illumina RNA-Seq methodology, and obtained 9,015,318 reads, with an average read length of approximately 76 bp. We mapped approximately 9.4% reads onto the reference DNA sequence of H. somni strain 2336 using the alignment program Bowtie [20]. To determine expressed regions in the genome, we estimated the average coverage depth of reads mapped per nucleotide/base. We used pileup format, which represents the signal map file for the whole genome in which alignment results (coverage depth) are represented in per-base format.

The single nucleotide resolution map helped uncover the structure and complexity of this pathogen's transcriptome and led to the identification of novel, small RNAs and protein coding genes as well as gene co-expression. Prokaryotic genome annotation is performed often using computational gene prediction programs [8], [9]. However, these prediction algorithms are not able to identify the non-coding sRNAs, antisense transcripts, and other small proteins. To overcome the shortcomings of computational genome structural annotation, various experimental methods are used for identification of novel expressed elements [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [26], [27], [28]. Deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged recently as a method that enables the study of RNA-based structural and regulatory regions at the genome scale. RNA-Seq technology has many advantages compared with existing array based methods for transcriptome analysis. In particular, RNA-Seq does not require probes, so the process is free from probe design issues or bias from hybridization issues. Also, the transcriptome coverage from RNA-Seq is very high [29], [30]. RNA-Seq was demonstrated to be effective for the discovery of bacterial non- coding RNAs, accurate operon definition, and correction of gene annotation [27], [31], [32]. Therefore, in the current study, we used RNA-Seq for profiling H. somni 2336 transcriptome.",

We analyzed BLAST results manually, to identify novel protein coding regions and start codon corrections. If no protein coding region was found in the intergenic expressed regions, the presence of a promoter or a rho-independent terminator allowed us to classify the regions as sRNA. Bacterial promoter sequences were predicted by Neural Network Promoter Prediction program (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html) [43]. Rho-independent transcription terminators were identified using the program TransTermHP [44]. For functional annotation, all identified identified sRNA sequences were searched against the Rfam database [23]. sRNA sequence conservation among other genomes was determined by blastn searches against non-redundant nucleotide database at NCBI.
