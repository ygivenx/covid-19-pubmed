Next, the hybridoma cell lines that survived culture in HAT and HT media were screened by IFA against the PEDV strain FJzz1/2011. We obtained six positive clones (F21-F3, F31-F3, F31-D4, F31-G4, F31-D6 and F42-G4) that were specific to PEDV (Fig. 1a). We then examined which MAbs could detect the GST-tagged recombinant N protein using indirect ELISA. F31-D4 and F31-D6 exhibited a positive color, whereas F21-F3, F31-F3, F31-G4 and F42-G4 were negative (Fig. 1b). We designated the MAbs secreted by hybridomas F31-D4 and F31-D6 as PN-D4 and PN-D6, respectively. The results suggested that MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 are specific to PEDV N protein.",

The results in Fig. 3 showed that the minimum antigenic epitopes that MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 could recognize were N1-10 (residues 18\u2013133) and N2-10 (residues 252\u2013262), respectively, which were designated NEP-D4 and NEP-D6, respectively.",

The results revealed that HLJ/2011 could be recognized by both PN-D4 and PN-D6 (Fig. 3g and h), suggesting these three substitutions do not alter the antigenicity of epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 and that both NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 are highly conserved. In addition, sequence alignment among all the known members within subfamily Coronavirinae revealed that epitope NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 are highly specific to PEDV (Fig. 4b) because the homology of these two regions between PEDV and all other members of Coronavirinae remains very low (<44%).",

One of these tools, the GeneSilico MetaDisorder server, was used to predict the intrinsic disorder. Three regions presented with the highest propensity for intrinsic disorder, which we designated as PIDR1819202122, PIDR107\u2013116 and PIDR127\u2013133 (Fig. 5a). The prediction suggested that there might be some intrinsically disordered regions on NEP-D4. To verify this prediction, purified GST-tagged NEP-D4 was treated with trypsin and used for detection against PN-D4 or anti-GST antibody by Western blotting. We observed that the trypsin-treated peptide was recognized by anti-GST antibody but not by MAb PN-D4 (Fig. 5b). In addition, we repeated the experiment with the freeze-thaw cycle-treated GST-tagged NEP-D4. The result showed that the treated peptide (up to 5 and 10 cycles) could be recognized by MAb PN-D4 but not by the anti-GST antibody (Fig. 5c). The intrinsically disordered proteins have a high proportion of solvent-exposed residues, making them highly accessible to protease and resistant to cold treatment6566. Taken together, these results suggested that NEP-D4 is likely to be an intrinsically disordered protein.",

The amino acids of NEP-D6 were located in close proximity and were exposed on the surface of the N protein, suggesting that NEP-D6 is highly likely to be a linear epitope. By contrast, NEP-D4 is much more complex; although most of the amino acids are located on the surface, a small fraction of its residues are buried inside the N protein, suggesting that NEP-D4 is more likely to be a conformational epitope (Fig. 6).",

            "text": "As one of the most serious intestinal infectious diseases, PED has posed a substantial threat to the swine industry of many countries over the last few years121667. The accurate diagnosis at the early stage of infection plays a key role in PEDV prevention. The N protein of PEDV consists of 441 amino acids and represents an essential agent in the formation of the virus nucleocapsid structure. The abundant expression of N protein in PEDV-infected cells and the high conservation among different PEDV strains make it fairly suitable for use as a target for PEDV diagnosis3068. However, the epitopes on PEDV N protein have been poorly characterized. In the present study, six monoclonal antibodies were generated against PEDV from BALB/c mice immunized with the purified PEDV strain FJzz1/2011. Among these antibodies, MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 were demonstrated as N protein-specific; the remaining four MAbs are still being studied (data not shown). Combined with ELISA and Western blotting, peptide scanning was performed to identify the epitopes of MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6. We confirmed that Leu18 and Ile133 were the essential amino acids of the epitope NEP-D4 because the deletion of either of these amino acids stopped the recognition between NEP-D4 and PN-D4. Notably, the absorbance value also largely declined when the peptide was truncated at Leu18 instead of Ser17. Therefore, Ser17 might have a significant effect on the antigenicity of NEP-D4, although Leu18 was the only essential amino acid at the N-terminus of this epitope. Likewise, Arg252 and Lys262 are crucial amino acids for the binding of epitope NEP-D6 with MAb PN-D6. The results suggested that NEP-D4 (residues 18\u2013133) and NEP-D6 (residues 252\u2013262) are the specific antigenic epitopes of MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6, respectively.",

Additionally, the sequence similarities of the epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 with the representative strains were 98.3\u2013100% and 81.8\u2013100%, respectively. Although three major mutations, Asn123 to Lys, Arg252 to Lys, and Ser255 to Asn, were observed in certain strains, these substitutions do not alter the antigenicity of NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 because PN-D4 and PN-D6 could precisely recognize another PEDV strain, HLJ/2011, which was isolated in our laboratory and contains all three of these mutations (Fig. 3g and h). In addition, we demonstrated that NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 could be recognized by PEDV pig antisera collected at 14 and 21 days after inoculation with PEDV, indicating that PEDV infection could induce specific host antibodies against NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 (Fig. 3c and d). These findings suggested that epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 were highly conserved and immunogenic; both MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 and epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 have the potential for use as effective tools in the serological diagnosis of PEDV during early stages of infection. Thus far, N protein and MAbs against N protein have been widely used for the diagnosis of PEDV.

Thus, the epitopes of N protein used for PEDV diagnosis should be highly PEDV-specific and the reported immunoassays above should be seriously re-examined. We analyzed the NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 epitope sequences of PEDV and other members within the subfamily Coronavirinae, especially TGEV, PRCV, and PDCoV, all of which can infect newborn piglets. We found that the amino acid sequences of NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 of PEDV differed greatly from their counterparts in other coronaviruses. NEP-D4 shared less than 43.1% homology with TGEV and PRCV of Alphacoronavirus, and only 26.5% homology with PDCoV of Deltacoronavirus. The homology of NEP-D6 between PEDV and the other three viruses (TGEV, PRCV, and PDCoV) remained at zero. We also used IFA to investigate whether NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 could induce cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV. The results showed that neither PN-D4 nor PN-D6 recognized TGEV, and the TGEV SH/2012 hyperimmune pig antisera failed to react with NEP-D4 and NEP-D6; these results indicated that NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 were unable to cause a cross-reaction between PEDV and TGEV. Therefore, the MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 and their corresponding epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 have the potential for use in developing an immunoassay that differentiates between PEDV and TGEV.",

            "text": "The epitope NEP-D6 has 11 amino acids and can be recognized by PN-D6 using Western blotting, a method that imposes protein denaturation. This finding indicates that NEP-D6 is a linear epitope, which agreed with the result that NEP-D6 is located on the surface of the predicted 3D structure of N protein (Fig. 6a and b). However, the epitope NEP-D4 seems much more complicated. Western blotting suggested that NEP-D4 is a linear epitope, which contradicts the previous assumption that the full 116 aa length is too large to be a linear epitope when bound to an antibody. Again, multiple residues are buried inside N protein, and there is a significant spatial distance between the first residue (Leu18) and last residue (Glu133) of NEP-D4 (Fig. 6d,e and f). The NEP-D4 portion of the 3D model is highly reliable because the residues 18\u2013133 were constructed based on five templates (PDB IDs: c3hd4A, d2bxxa1, d2geca1, d1sska and c4ud1B) at nearly 100% confidence, as shown in Fig. 6h. Therefore, NEP-D4 is more likely to be a conformational epitope than a linear epitope. Interestingly, a denatured conformational epitope is unexpectedly recognized by its cognate antibody in Western blotting. Although it is possible that the formation of some disulfide bridges between certain residues may have contributed to this binding effect, this possibility was ruled out by the ability of PN-D4 to react with dithiothreitol (DTT)-treated NEP-D4 in a Western blotting assay (Fig. 5d). Additionally, no disulfide bridges were predicted by the online software PredictProtein (data not shown). We also analyzed the other properties of NEP-D4. The software GeneSilico metadisorder predicted that NEP-D4 is an intrinsically disordered protein, which was further confirmed by two independent experiments: namely, trypsin-treated NEP-D4 could not react with PN-D4, and NEP-D4 underwent freeze-thaw cycles (up to 5 and 10 times) that were indeed recognized by PN-D4, albeit weakly. As previous findings have shown, the solvent-exposed residues on IDPs make proteins highly susceptible to protease; moreover, IDPs have much higher cold stability than structured proteins6566. Thus, we speculated that folding occurred upon binding, which may have led to the recognition of NEP-D4 by PN-D4. Specifically, when the antibody binds to the first or last residue of the epitope NEP-D4, it may trigger the disordered domain to fold completely to form a certain conformational site, which could, in turn, be recognized by MAb PN-D4. In a previous study, different PEDV and TGEV pig antisera were used in a two-way cross-reactivity examination of different PEDV and TGEV strains, but only a one-way reactivity between TGEV Miller hyperimmune pig antisera and PEDV strains was observed. The complex mechanism remains unclear47. However, given that the N-terminal region of the N protein is intrinsically disordered, some disordered epitopes such as NEP-D4, which may be folded under certain conditions, might be the cause of the one-cross reactivity between PEDV and TGEV. In other words, the antibodies generated from PEDF infection cannot induce the folding of the disordered epitope on TGEV, whereas the corresponding epitope on PEDV can fold upon the binding of the antibodies produced from the infection of certain TGEV strains with specific epitopes. These hypotheses merit further investigation.",
