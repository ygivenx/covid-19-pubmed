            "text": "The viral linear double-stranded DNA genome of ~36,000 bp, is delivered to the host cell nucleus rapidly after virus entry, where mRNA is transcribed from both DNA strands using host cell RNA pol II. Transcription from ten different transcription units proceeds in early, intermediate or late temporal classes, as defined relative to the onset of viral DNA replication3. There are early (E1a, E1b, E2, E3 and E4) and intermediate (IVa2, pIX and L4) transcription units, as well as the major late transcription unit (MLTU) driven by the major late promoter (MLP) that produces transcripts for most of the virus\u2019s structural proteins. Except for pIX mRNA, all adenovirus transcripts are spliced. The MLTU itself has over 20 distinct alternative splice sites and five distinct polyadenylation sites giving rise to five different classes of mRNA L1\u2013L5. There are three non-coding exons at the 5\u2032 of all known late mRNA (known collectively as the tripartite leader, TPL) as well as three non-coding exons present in varying amounts on a subset of MLTU mRNA (known as the x-, y- and z-leaders)4,5. Finally, there is the i-leader exon, which is infrequently included between the second and third TPL exons, and codes for the i-leader protein6. Thus, the MLTU produces a complex array of mRNA with diverse 5\u2032-UTRs5, some of which are known to influence mRNA stability, spliced onto different 3\u2032 coding exons grouped into five different 3\u2032-end classes.",

            "text": "Short-read deep sequencing has created a high-resolution image of the adenovirus transcriptional landscape7,8. However, there are difficulties determining how multiple splicing events are linked on a particular mRNA. For example, when i-leader exon is included in an MLTU mRNA, it is unclear which of the possible MLTU 3\u2032 exons it has been added to. Secondly, in short-read sequencing the mRNA is fragmented, reverse transcribed into cDNA, then amplified by PCR before sequencing using a second PCR-based method. These steps could introduce bias confounding qualitative and quantitative analysis. Nanopore-based direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) avoids these issues because individual mRNA molecules are introduced, poly-A tail first, into the nanopore with their sequences read as they pass through the pore. This provides a direct and complete record of the exons present in any given mRNA without reverse transcription or amplification steps. dRNA-seq has recently been used to examine the transcriptome of human cells9,10, coronavirus11 and herpes simplex virus12, revealing greater complexity than previously appreciated and underlining the power of this approach to improve our understanding of transcriptomes, even in well-studied systems.",

Key to this deeper understanding was the development of an ORF-centric approach to classification of the data.

Very few transcripts that could code for E1b19k were detected in our data before programmatic extension of the 5\u2032-end (above), after which the vast majority of detected E1b transcripts coded for this protein. This intervention therefore converted apparently E1b55k mRNAs into E1b19k mRNAs. It is generally understood that translation initiation at the E1b19k AUG is inefficient, leading to the significant expression of E1b55k from these mRNAs as a group but it cannot be excluded, given the presence in our data of mapped 5\u2032-ends lying downstream of the E1b19k AUG, that some of these RNAs genuinely initiate at these locations and encode E1b55k as the 5\u2032 proximal ORF.",

The RNAs encoding E2B proteins also share their TTS with the IVa2 gene22. A further gene known as UXP (ref. 23) has a shared TTS with the transcripts for DBP. As expected from the previous data, the levels of transcript for pTP and Ad-pol were very low (fewer than five transcripts), whereas mRNA levels for DBP were very high and were detected coming from both E2-early and E2-late promoters with the E2-early promoter always dominant. We also detected DBP-coding transcripts at all time points driven by the E4 promoter and a small number of individual transcripts that extended beyond the normal TTS (Fig. 4a). Importantly, we detected previously unreported DBP-coding transcripts, including one group without the usual second exon (nt 24,745\u201324,668) and another with a previously undescribed exon (nt 25,947\u201325,839; Fig. 4a). We also identified a substantial number of spliced transcripts (with copy numbers < 100) that can only code for DBP if the 5\u2032 proximal AUG is skipped (Fig. 4b). In the dominant example of this, an additional previously unreported exon (24,331\u201324,150/47) containing a short ORF is incorporated upstream of the DBP-coding exon.",

Our data support the concept that E3 expression is highly complex and provides evidence for rare transcripts clarifying aspects of E3 gene expression. For example, expression of E3 gp19K protein could only previously be explained by translation (re-)initiation at the downstream or second ORF on the E3 Cr1-alpha transcript, something that is known in other viral systems27. While this may occur, we detect transcripts from MLP whereby the TPL is directly spliced onto the gp19K ORF (Fig. 5b). Indeed, splicing from the TPL directly to splice acceptor sites just upstream of each of the relevant E3 ORFs is common28, was reflected in our data, and may be one strategy used by the virus to ensure all E3 proteins are expressed. Considering E3 transcripts in our data that arose from either the E3 promoter or the MLP as a whole, we identified all known E3 transcript classes. Similar to the other transcription units, there were a large number of non-classical transcripts involving splice events and exon combinations that have not been reported before (Supplementary Data 4).",

However, the levels of transcript for each protein did not reflect the stoichiometry of those proteins within the virion. For example, there are 20-fold more copies of hexon polypeptide than fibre polypeptide in each virus particle32, whereas more fibre (12%) than hexon (7.7%) coding transcripts were detected at 48 h.p.i.

PreX is proteolytically matured by the viral 23K proteinase post assembly33,34; the mature pX associates with viral DNA in the particle alongside viral proteins pV and pVII, providing histone-like functions. There are ~150 copies of pV, ~300 copies of pX and ~500 copies of pVII in a virus particle35, which is at odds with the observed transcript abundance ratio (2.3% pV, 3.1% preVIII and 8% for preX), suggesting either that the abundance estimate for pX in particles is inaccurate, or that more is made than is needed or that preX/pX proteins have additional roles beyond viral DNA packaging.",

Inclusion of i-leader followed by TPL3 forms an ORF that terminates in TPL3 and encodes the i-leader protein regardless of downstream splicing events.

We found over 3000 distinct transcripts of this type belonging to 900 different transcript groups creating 60 distinct ORFs, with the i-leader protein N terminus fused to different C termini.

Also, the x, y- and z-leader exons have intron\u2013exon boundaries that are integral to expression of some E3 proteins, meaning they are established components of some E3 mRNAs.

Whether these proteins are made and are functional is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but the large number of alternative transcripts is striking. For example, focusing on fibre-coding transcripts and considering only those that started and terminated at the dominant TSS (nucleotide 6051) and TTS (nucleotide 32,790) sites to exclude transcript groups that likely arose from truncated transcripts, 123 different groups were found (covering 59,005 independent sequence reads). Even considering only transcript groups with ten or more supporting reads, there were 17 distinct transcript groups with fibre protein as the 5\u2032 proximal ORF (Fig. 10a); similar observations were made for most of the known ORFs (e.g., Figs. 4 and 6). Most notably among fibre-coding transcripts, the TPL was not always intact, with TPL exon 2 being sometimes spliced directly to the y-leader exon or to the fibre ORF; low-frequency omission of TPL exon 3 was also seen in transcripts encoding other late proteins. Previously, the TPL (sometimes with the further inclusion of the i-leader exon, above), has been viewed as an invariant feature of MLP-derived transcripts. Also, none of the most abundant transcript groups contained the x- or z- leader exons, which were previously reported to be found in a proportion of L5 mRNAs (ref. 4); instead an apparently novel exon was found >50 times in two transcript groups, positioned 3\u2032 to the y-leader exon. Finally, the sizes of TPL exons 2 and 3, as well as the y-leader exon, varied among the groups as a result of usage of splice donor and/or acceptor sites which have not been reported previously.",

Adenoviruses use of alternative splicing combined with a modest number of promoters and polyadenylation sites makes for a particularly complex transcriptome. Part of this challenge is the large volume of data generated by dRNA-seq. Our approach to managing this data complexity was to group transcripts based on their structure and then to annotate them for their potential to code for known proteins, which in turn allowed definition of suspected novel protein-coding opportunities within the RNA. This supervised, but essentially unbiased, approach was shown to produce a transcript map for human adenovirus that was strikingly similar to the classical map.",

For the most part, observed transcript abundances for the major proteins were as expected. However, one (of several) notable exceptions is preX. This is a 79aa protein precursor that is cleaved after virion assembly into three components, the middle 19aa of which comprise the mature protein X that is associated with viral DNA inside the particle alongside viral histone-like proteins pV and pVII (refs. 39\u201341). However, the roles of the other portions of preX that are liberated by this cleavage and any additional roles of the precursor relative to the mature protein are not understood. Although the excess of preX transcripts over those of pV and preVII may be needed to compensate for differences in translation rates and stability of these proteins, we believe it also suggests additional role(s) for preX. Indeed, there are many cases where our observations raise interesting questions in relation to the large body of previously published work on adenoviruses. While it is beyond the scope of this manuscript to compare in detail this dataset with that work, we believe that the raw and analysed data will prove useful to other teams working on adenovirus transcription and splicing control.",

The 5\u2032-end position inferred by dRNA-seq was 11\u201316 nt downstream of the previously mapped 5\u2032-end for all the adenovirus promoters\u2014a number that agrees with human dRNA-seq datasets14. The precise peak count position at each promoter was reproducible between different time point samples, indicating that differences in the sequence near the 5\u2032-end affect how close to the end of an RNA molecule dRNA-seq can read. At the 3\u2032-end there are distinct issues too; even though we could both detect and measure the length of poly-A tail, there was a notable lack of precision over the TTS. That the mapping software usually clipped the 3\u2032-end of a sequence when aligning it to the genome suggested different possibilities. Potentially, mapping accurately within what is typically an A/U rich region poses problems for mapping algorithms. Alternatively, as the raw nanopore signal transitions from poly-A tail to the mixed nucleotide sequence of the RNA, there may be additional difficulties with accurate base calling. The shortening of the viral poly-A tail for viral late transcripts is intriguing; a similar observation has been reported for coronaviruses and this was associated with reduced translation efficiency43. Further work will be needed to see if this is the case for adenovirus. We propose that adenovirus is a useful testbed for dRNA-seq experiments aimed at improving the capture of 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-end sequence information.",

The first (classify_transcripts_and_polya.pl) establishes the locations of TSS and TTS alongside possible splice acceptor/donor sites. This script produces tables indicating where on the genome and how often in the data each TSS, TTS or splice site occurs. Subsequently, these events are grouped for simplicity of analysis. For example, the most frequently used polyadenylation site is established and all other polyadenylation sites within a user defined window (in our case 15 nucleotides either side) are presumed to be grouped with that location. Once this is done the next most abundant site outside this 15-nucleotide window is selected and so on until all the polyadenylation sites are accounted for. In this analysis, splice acceptor and donor sites are not grouped. Once this is complete, the software then assigns each transcript to a \u201ctranscript group\u201d depending on its pattern of TSS, splice sites and TTS locations, and counts how many transcripts belong to each transcript group.",

It first uses the transcription start, termination and splice site locations for each transcript group to create a pseudo transcript based on the genome sequence, in effect a consensus for the group. The user can specify how many nucleotides upstream of the transcript start site for the group should be included in each pseudo transcript, in order to compensate for any observed failure to fully sequence the 5\u2032 ends of the RNA (see Results section). The script then examines each pseudo transcript to determine what features it has, using a user-specified list of canonical features or ORFs on the viral genome (Supplementary Data 9). For example, it will define the 5\u2032 most ORF and if that ORF is not canonical, search for a canonical ORF coded by the next available start codon. Finally, the software produces tables that indicate how many transcripts in total, from all the transcript groups, code for each ORF listed in the features table. The tables also include additional data, such as average polyA length for each transcript group, and the sequences of the splice donor and splice acceptor sites for all exons detected. It also produces GFF files that allow the user to visualise the dominant transcript coding for each ORF, as well as GFF files that describe the whole range of transcripts coding for any given ORF (Supplementary Data 10\u201313). In addition, an analysis counting the final number of transcripts belonging to each translated feature is produced (Supplementary Data 14).
