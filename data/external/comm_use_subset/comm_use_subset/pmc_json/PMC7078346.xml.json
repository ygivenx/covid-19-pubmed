PCI is widely used in the treatment of CHD (Cheng et al., 2019; Dayoub et al., 2019). Although the cases of the patients with coronary artery restenosis and thrombosis can be reduced from 30\u201340 to 15% after 1 year of PCI, restenosis, and thrombosis are still serious clinical problems (Jaffery et al., 2011; Hofma et al., 2015). Therefore, controlling the risk factors of CHD is still necessary to prevent the occurrence of MACEs.",

The exercise needs mental concentration, physical balance, and muscle relaxation and shows a great potential in rehabilitating medical and psychological status (Yeh et al., 2009). Tai Chi even effectively treats adolescents with depression (Zhang et al., 2018). SSD and SSA are common in the elderly population and can cause suicide risk and disability. Tai Chi has been proven to improve SSD and SSA symptoms over 1 year of intervention (Rawtaer et al., 2015). Meta-analysis has shown that Tai Chi intervention reduced the Hamilton Depression Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores of stroke patients (Yang et al., 2018). Another meta-analysis has indicated that Tai Chi is a worthy complementary non-pharmacological resource which works by ameliorating depression and anxiety and may have great implications in public health (Zhang et al., 2019). However, the effects of Tai Chi on the anxiety and depression of patients with CHD after PCI and its related molecular mechanisms remain unclear.",

The miR-17-92 cluster is an important indicator in the development of the immune system, the heart, and the lung and in oncogenic patients. It is involved with cellular innate and adaptive immunity, such as B cells, T-lymphocyte subsets, T follicular helper cells, regulatory T cells, monocytes, macrophages, and so on (Kuo et al., 2019). The miR-17-92 cluster plays a critical role in cardiomyocyte proliferation (Gao et al., 2019) and affects the development of various diseases by regulating many related cellular processes and multiple target genes, including neurological diseases and cardiac diseases (Bai et al., 2019). The members of the miR-17-92 cluster and the expression of their passenger miRNAs expressions promote exercise-induced cardiac growth and reduce adverse ventricular remodeling (Shi et al., 2017). Cardiac rehabilitation will contribute in protecting against the development of depression and anxiety (Zheng et al., 2019). A recent study showed that miR-17-92 may regulate neurogenesis and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Jin et al., 2016). Tai Chi can affect the level of miRNA, and it possibly also affects the level of miR-17-92 because it can improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression (Rawtaer et al., 2015).",

The former styles are effective in improving global cognitive function, balance, and fitness (Zou et al., 2019). However, Chen style is more complex than Yang style; thus, the latter style of Tai Chi (24-form) was tried in the present work. The present paper aims to investigate the effects of the 24-form Tai Chi on the anxiety and the depression of CHD patients after PCI.",

For instance, preclinical evidence supports that the microRNA-34 family is involved in stress-related psychiatric conditions and in the modulation of depression (Lo Iacono et al., 2019). miR-140-5p has been found to be associated with the pathogenesis of late-onset post-stroke depression (Liang et al., 2019). The miR-101a-3p and its target, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) in the amygdala, contribute to anxiety-like behavior (Cohen et al., 2017). The microRNA levels may change based on the training type or exercise (Domanska-Senderowska et al., 2019). Aerobic exercise delays neurodegenerative diseases and lesions by regulating miR-3557/324 (Liu et al., 2019). It is quite possible that Tai Chi also induces the changes in miRNA. The present work also showed that the serum level of miR-17-92 was increased after Tai Chi intervention. Furthermore, a negative correlation between the serum level of miR-17-92 and the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress was observed (Figure 5). The results suggested that the miR-17-92 changes may contribute to the emotional changes.",

The exact molecular mechanism for the functional role of Tai Chi was not explored in the CHD patients after PCI. The possible side effects of Tai Chi were not investigated, although most reports showed that Tai Chi could reduce most side effects of various diseases (Murley et al., 2019; So et al., 2019). According to our experiences, there is a difference in learning Tai Chi between males and females, but the issue was not explored in the present study. Further work is highly needed in the future.",
