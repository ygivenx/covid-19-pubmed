A recent population-based study showed that HRV was detected in 26% of children under 5 years of age hospitalized with respiratory symptoms or fever [10]. Subsequently, studies in high income countries have confirmed the importance of HRV as a cause of severe LRTI in young children requiring hospitalization [11,12]. It is unclear if the diverse spectrum of clinical illnesses associated with HRV infection is related to host factors, the infecting HRV type or both. Recent evidence suggests that infection with HRV-C may result in more severe disease [12-16].",

Exclusion criteria were known underlying cardiac or chronic pulmonary disease (other than asthma), presence of stridor or daily treatment with oral corticosteroids for more than 2 days prior. Eligible children were sequentially enrolled from Monday to Friday during working hours. Clinical and sociodemographic information were recorded.

The purified RNA sample was converted into cDNA using random primers (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Samples were screened for HRV using PCR primers targeting the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) which had previously been shown to amplify all known serotypes and HRV-C species [22]. In the first reaction 10 \u03bcl cDNA was added to a 50 \u03bcl PCR mix containing 2 IU Supertherm polymerase (JMR Holdings, Kent, UK), 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 \u03bcmol/L each dNTP (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and 0.2 \u03bcmol/L P1-1 and P3-1 primers [22]. Amplification was performed on a Thermo Hybaid PxE 0.2 thermal cycler (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), with the following conditions: 1 cycle of 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes, 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 50\u00b0C for 25 s, and 72\u00b0C for 35 s, and a final elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 7 minutes. The second round semi-nested PCR was performed on 2.5 \u03bcL outer PCR product using the same basic master mix ingredients containing 0.2 \u03bcmol/L P1-1, P2-1, P2-2, and P2-3 primers [22]. Cycling conditions were as for the first round PCR with an increase in annealing temperature to 55\u00b0C. Amplified products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel, and visualized under UV irradiation after staining with ethidium bromide. The expected sizes of the outer and inner HRV PCR products were 390 bp and 300 bp respectively. VP4/VP2 amplification was performed as above on a selection of HRV-C and HRV-A samples to differentiate HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants using the primers described by Huang et al. [19]. All work was performed in an ISO-15189 accredited molecular laboratory which employs strict precautions to prevent contamination.",

However, there is now accumulating evidence that HRV-associated illness occurs in young children with LRTI with many studies from other areas of the world reporting HRV detection rates from 24% to 48% [11,30,31], and as high as 78% in predisposed children [32]. Consistent with these, 72% of the HRV-positive children were under 2 years. This data is also consistent with prior studies that report mild to moderate illness in most children [11], although in this study a third required hospitalization. The study suggests that HRV is responsible for a large burden of illness in young African children with associated implications for health care utilisation.",

Interestingly this pattern was more prominent with HRV-A than HRV-C and HRV-B which were detected throughout the year or sporadically. Seasonal variation is a common feature of many respiratory viruses, including RSV, influenza, parainfluenza virus, and although the causes of this variation are largely unknown, one possible explanation may be as a result of viral interference where one respiratory virus predominates and prevents other viruses from establishing infection at the same time. As the study was of 18 months duration any inferences about seasonality are difficult to make. However, the study period included 2 winter seasons. Further long term studies of the epidemiology of viral infections and HRV specifically in African children are needed.",

[19], HRV-C was the most prevalent followed by HRV-A and HRV-B. This distribution pattern is different from other studies where HRV-A was more frequently detected; this may vary depending on the population [21,24,37]. Consistent with previous studies HRV-C was the common type in children with wheezing and asthma [13,21,37]. Typing using the 5'UTR may underestimate the true number of HRV-C samples as there is evidence that recombination with HRV-A species at this site is a common occurrence, resulting in these types grouping with HRV-A species instead of HRV-C [19,38]. However, limited sequencing of the VP4/VP2 region (data not shown) and inclusion of sequences of HRV-C with HRV-A-like 5'UTR's in the phylogenetic analysis confirmed that HRV-C was the most common species in this population, with HRV-Ca more prevalent (65%) than HRV-Cc. Further confirmation is that all HRV-Ca sequences from this study grouped phylogenetically with GenBank-derived HRV isolates that have been confirmed to be true HRV-C types based on the classification proposed by Simmonds et al [27]. As most children presented with mild or moderate illness, and as only a subgroup of HRV isolates were sub-typed, we were unable to investigate the association between HRV species and clinical severity; this requires further investigation.",

However, previous studies have reported that HRV is more frequently found in sick children than in asymptomatic children [4,11]. HRV can be shed from the nasophaynx for 10 to 14 days in immunocompetent individuals with extended shedding in immunocompromised patients [9]. The immune status of children enrolled in this study was not recorded, although it can be inferred that some children may have been HIV-positive as South Africa is a high HIV burden country. Thus detection of HRV in some children with wheezy illness may therefore be an incidental finding due to extended shedding. Due to resource limitations, only a subset of specimens could be tested for the common respiratory viruses (RSV, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and adenovirus) using the relatively insensitive general shell vial culture assay which does not provide sufficient information to determine the role of co-infection and disease severity. Finally, the study did not test for all known respiratory viruses (e.g. human coronavirus 229E and OC43, and human parainfluenza type 4) and recently discovered viruses (e.g. human coronavirus HKU1 and polyomaviruses K1 and Wu) which may also play a role in wheezy illness.",
