R0 is the most widely used epidemiological measurement of the transmission potential in a given population. Statistical estimation of R0 has been performed for various infectious diseases [2,3], aiming towards understanding the dynamics of transmission and evolution, and designing effective public health intervention strategies. In particular, R0 has been used for determining the minimum coverage of immunization, because the threshold condition to prevent a major epidemic in a randomly-mixing population is given by 1-1/R0 [4]. In addition, R0 gives an estimate of the so-called final size, i.e., the proportion of the population that will experience infection by the end of an epidemic [5,6].",

When one estimates R0 using epidemic data of an emerging (or exotic) disease, the exponential growth rate, r, of infections during the initial phase of the epidemic is used [8,9]. Assuming that the generation time, i.e., the time from infection of a primary case to infection of a secondary case generated by the primary case [10], is known (or separately estimated from other empirical data), the growth rate r is transformed to R0 using that knowledge (see below). That is, the conventional estimation technique has required two statistical steps, namely, first estimate r and then convert r to R0.",

The frequency of secondary transmissions relative to infection-age \u03c4 (i.e., the generation time distribution), approximated by a step function, is shown in Figure 1. As has been known for some time [19], the frequency of secondary transmissions is very high shortly after infection (for a duration d1 = 0.24 years), followed by a long asymptomatic period with a low frequency of secondary transmissions (for d2 = 8.38 years) [20]. Subsequently, the frequency rises sharply again resulting in a substantial number of secondary cases for a duration d3 = 0.75 years until death or until the infected individual ceases risky sexual contact due to AIDS [20\u201322]. Assuming that the contact frequency does not vary as a function of infection-age, g1, g2 and g3 have been estimated at 1.30, 0.05 and 0.36 per year [20].

The present study does not discuss the details of back-calculation, but explanatory guides can be found elsewhere [24\u201326]. Figure 2B shows the enlarged HIV incidence curve during the initial phase of an epidemic. The peak incidence was observed in 1982 for Western Germany and 1983 for France and the UK.

Thus, a likelihood-based approach to reconstructing the tree is considered (Figure 3B) [29\u201331]. Given the total number of effective contacts that have equal potential for resulting in secondary transmission, the probability of a single effective contact resulting in a secondary transmission (or the probability that a secondary case is linked to an effective contact made by a single primary case in year t) is given by 1/R0. This is a simple binomial sampling process.

Again, Western Germany yielded the highest estimate without an overlap of the uncertainty bound with the other two countries. The maximum likelihood estimate of R0 based on the proposed new method ranged from 3.59 to 3.74. Not only were the qualitative patterns for the expected values of R0 consistent with those based on an exponential growth assumption, but the 95% CI also broadly overlapped with those based on the other method. In particular, although R0 in Western Germany using the proposed method is smaller than that based on an exponential growth assumption, the 95% CIs of the two methods overlapped. The 95% CI based on the proposed method appeared to be wider than those based on exponential growth assumption. Since HIV is mainly transmitted via sexual contact, the above mentioned estimate may vary with the mixing pattern and contact frequency (thus, there is no general disease-specific R0, especially for HIV/AIDS). At least, compared with a previous estimate of R0 as ranging from 13.9 to 54.5 in the USA, based on an exponential growth assumption that adopted a mean infectious period of 10 years [32], R0 in the present study appeared to be much smaller using a precise estimate of the generation time distribution.",

R0 in the present study can even be interpreted as R0 for a heterogeneously-mixing population (i.e., the dominant eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix), provided that the early growth rate is the same among sub-populations (though it is not the case if the growth rate varies across sub-populations) [34,35]. Analyzing heterogeneous transmission among approximately-aggregated discrete groups, the estimate of the next-generation matrix would give more detailed insights into the epidemic dynamics, including the most important target host for intervention [36]. As discussed in a modeling study in this special issue of the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health [37], understanding the implications of sexual partnerships and their variations as a function of calendar time as well as infection-age is also of utmost importance. As the next step for a similar estimation framework, methods for estimating robust R0 and the next-generation matrix from structured data (i.e., data stratified by age- and/or risk-groups) will be useful. Despite the future challenges, I believe the present study at least satisfies a need to offer a likelihood-based approach to estimate R0 from early epidemic growth data, while being easily tractable and calculable among general epidemiologists.",

A step function is employed to approximately model the frequency of secondary transmissions relative to infection-age. For d1 years shortly after infection, the frequency g1 is very high. Subsequently, for d2 years (i.e., during the asymptomatic period), g2 is persistently low, followed by a time period with high infectiousness g3 for d3 years until death or no secondary transmission due to AIDS. Following a statistical study [20], d1, d2 and d3 are assumed to be 0.24, 8.38 and 0.75 years. Assuming that the contact frequency does not vary as a function of time since infection, g1, g2 and g3 are estimated at 1.30, 0.05 and 0.36 per year.",
