Recently, two independent groups reported the identification of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) in different Chinese horseshoe bat species, providing strong evidence that bats could serve as natural reservoirs of SARS CoV [18]\u2013[20]. The S coding sequence of SL-CoV isolated from bats displays low level of similarity to those isolated from human (76%) or civets (78%) [18]\u2013[20], while the E and M proteins of SL-CoV have high sequence similarity (96% to 100%) to those from human or civets [19], [20]. It is worthy to note that the nucleotide sequence identity among these coronaviruses from different sources was greatly increased when the S region was excluded [19], [20]. The host range of coronaviruses was reported to correlate with the degree of S protein variations [21], suggesting that the variations in S protein are responsible for the interspecies transmission and the adaptation to new hosts.",

Many studies have documented that VLPs are capable of inducing B-cell-mediated immune responses and are highly effective in stimulating CD4 T cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses [23]\u2013[25]. The stimulating activities of Ebola, Marburg and HIV VLPs in dendritic cells (DCs) were previous investigated [26]\u2013[28], indicating that, unlike native virus, VLPs are effective stimulators of DCs and can enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. Our previous study described that VLPs formed by E, M and S proteins of SARS CoV elicited strong SARS CoV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice [29]. However, whether SL-CoV VLPs can elicit cytokines secretion or/and activate human DCs remains to be determined.",

The main variation between SL-CoV and SARS CoV of human or civet locates in the S protein [18]\u2013[20]. To study whether BS protein can be incorporated into VLPs formed by the E and M proteins of SARS-CoV, we co-infected sf21 cells with the recombinant baculoviruses vAcBS and vAcME. After 72 h of co-infection, the cells were collected and thin-sections were prepared and examined. As shown in Figure 1A, numerous viral particles, \u223c100 nm in diameter, were mainly observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Western blot and immunogold labeling were subsequently performed to detect the incorporation of BS in VLPs. As shown in Figure 1B, the presence of BS, M and E proteins was detected in BVLPs by using an anti-SARS CoV antibody. There were no corresponding bands in the negative control of preimmune rabit antiserum. The genomic differences between SL-CoV and SARS CoV largely locate in the S gene, particularly at the 5\u2032 end of S region (equivalent to S1 coding region). Therefore, it is not surprising that serum raised against human SARS CoV recognized bat SL-CoV S protein. The S2 coding region of S protein is highly conserved (\u223c96%) [5], [10], [21]. Using a specific anti-BS2 (Bat S2 region 667\u20131242 aa) antibody (Figure 1C), the gold particles were detected around the BVLPs in immunogold labeling analysis, further confirming the results of western blot. In addition, the anti-BS2 antibody also recognized the human SARS CoV VLPs but not VLPs formed by E and M proteins in the absence of S protein (Figure 1C). Taken together, our data indicate that the BS protein of SL-CoV was successfully incorporated into VLPs formed by the E and M proteins of human SARS CoV.",

To assess the effects of BVLPs on DCs, immature DCs were treated under various conditions and supernatants were collected for cytokine (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) quantification. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are proinflammatory cytokines while IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. As shown in Fig. 3, incubating DCs with BVLPs significantly enhanced the secretion levels of these three cytokines and were all similar to those in LPS-treated DCs. The boiled-BVLPs lost the ability to induce cytokine production. The secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 were 5\u201310 folds lower in heated BVLPs-treated DCs than those in BVLPs-treated DCs, although the secretion levels were still 5\u201315 folds higher than those in PBS or Ac treated groups. This enhancement is likely due to non-specific stimulation by remaining denatured proteins in heated BVLPs. Moreover, cytokine secretion profiles were similar in DCs inoculated with BVLPs with or without polymyxin B pretreatment, excluding the possibility of LPS contamination. In contrast, LPS-treated DCs significantly lost the cytokine-secretion ability with polymyxin B pretreatment. Combining the flow cytometry results in Fig. 2, it is reasonable to draw a conclusion that the structure of BVLPs, not LPS contamination, contributed to cytokine production in BVLPs-treated DCs.",

Similar to LPS treatment, both SARS CoV VLPs and BVLPs enhanced the expression of CD40, CD86, CD80 and CD83 (Fig. 4). However, BVLPs showed a stronger ability to induce the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, with 2 and 4 fold higher, respectively, while the secretion of IL 10 was similar (Fig. 5).

Thus, the BVLPs or SARS CoV VLPs treated DCs could polarize Th cells toward a Th1 phenotype.

These two plasmids were then immunized in mice intramuscularly every two weeks.

Antibodies against SARS CoV S protein inhibit pulmonary viral replication and protect against SARS CoV challenge [34]. Variations in the S proteins can dramatically affect the virulence and host tropism of the virus [35], [36]. For instance, SL-CoVs isolated from bats display greater genetic variations than SARS CoVs from humans or civets [19].

Because the major difference of S proteins between SARS CoV and SL-CoV locates in the S1 region (\u223c64%) and the S2 region is more conserved (92% to 96%) [19], [20], successful incorporation of the SL-CoV S protein into VLPs formed by the E and M proteins of SARS CoV suggests that such BVLPs likely assembled through S2 region other than S1 region.

Exposure of DCs to infectious SARS CoV leads to the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs, including costimulatory molecule expression, T cell-stimulation and cytokine production. [43]. In addition, UV-inactivated SARS CoV also activates immature DCs [44]. In this study, we have demonstrated that BVLPs, morphologically and antigenically similar to the native virus, exhibited stimulating ability in DCs and induced DC maturation by enhancing the expression of cell-surface costimulatory molecules including those essential for optimal activation of T cells: CD40, CD86, CD80 and CD83. Phenotypic maturation of DCs exposed to BVLPs was similar to those observed in DCs incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a well-known stimulator of DCs maturation. In contrast, heat-denatured BVLPs lost the ability to enhance the expression of cell surface molecules and the secretion of cytokine, suggesting that the specific structure of viral proteins might significantly contribute to the immune modulating activity. Taken together, our data indicate that the baculovirus derived-BVLPs can interact with human DCs to induce DC maturation and activation.",

Here, we showed that both BVLPs and SARS CoV VLPs activated DCs and induced DC maturation by enhancing the expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD86 and CD80) and the maturation marker CD83. A study in SARS CoV-infected patients indicated that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were markedly increased in the acute stage and returned to normal after given adequate immunosuppressive treatment [45]. Corticosteroid has been used for the treatment of SARS on the basis that proinflammatory cytokines is responsible for the immunopathology in the lungs [46]. Of interest, in the current study, BVLPs induced much higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 than did SARS CoV VLPs. It seemed that BVLPs vs DCs served as a better model to simulate the acute-phase response between the virus and the host. Thus, this model may be applicable in the development of vaccines and drugs against the virus. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 are important proinflammatory cytokines mediating apoptosis, immunity, and inflammation, and may play important role in antiviral responses and inflammation [31]. A previous study by Wang et al indicated that the S protein of SARS CoV played a key role in the production of proinflammatory cytokine at a stage of virus-host cell interaction. S protein could activate NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and thus up-regulate the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Here we demonstrate that BVLPs are stronger immune modulators in terms of DC activation and maturation. Since the only difference between SARS CoV VLPs and BVLPs was the S protein incorporated, the enhanced immune modulating ability of BVLPs is very likely contributed by the S protein.",

The balance between Th1 and Th2 cells is important and may determine the outcome of an immune response toward infection and allergy. We therefore studied the influence of BVLPs-stimulated DCs on T cell polarization by intracellular cytokine staining. Compared to mock-treated DCs, BVLPs-exposed DCs increased the population of IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4 positive CD4 T cells. The IFN-\u03b3 secretion level was much higher than that of IL-4, indicating a bias of Th1 immune response. Because matured DCs can enhance native T cells differentiation, these results further confirm that BVLPs can induce DCs activation and maturation.",
