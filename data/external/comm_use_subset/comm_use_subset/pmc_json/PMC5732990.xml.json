            "text": "Waterfowl parvovirus causes high morbidity and mortality in geese and Muscovy ducks, and mortality rate ranges from 10 to 80%. These diseases can lead to enteric symptoms, watery diarrhea, prostration, and growth retardation, thus resulting in serious economic losses to waterfowl industry (Gl\u00e1vits et al., 2005). In 2015, a disease, which emerged in France and Poland in the early 1970s in mule and Muscovy ducks was first reported in Chinese mainland (Chen et al., 2015). It mainly caused short beak, protruding tongues, fragile tibia and pteroid, and growth retardation to commercial ducks. The morbidity rate ranges from 10 to 30%, and even up to 50%, thereby resulting in enormous economic losses to duck industry of China. In order to identify the exact pathogen that caused this disease, pathogen isolation and identification and genomic sequence analysis were carried out. Isolated pathogen was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and the result showed that only GPV was positive; Genomic sequence analysis showed that this new pathogen shared 90.8\u201394.6% of nucleotide identity with goose parvovirus (GPV). These two studies above indicated that this new pathogen shared higher homology with other GPV strains. Therefore, it was called duck-origin novel goose parvovirus (N-GPV) (Chen et al., 2016). In common with other waterfowl parvovirus, N-GPV was also a member of the Parvoviridae family with a single-stranded DNA genome, and has a small, nonenveloped, icosahedral capsid packaging a single-stranded DNA genome of approximately 5,100 nucleotides. There are two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding non-structural proteins (NS), and capsid proteins (VP) (Chen et al., 2015).",

In addition, LAMP has been considered as a time-saving, low-cost, highly specific and sensitive method (Chotiwan et al., 2017), which can be completed within 60 min under condition of constant temperature, and it has been established to detect GPV, Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), canine parvovirus (CPV), and others targeting at VP gene (Cho et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2010; JinLong et al., 2010). Results of LAMP can be judged by either turbidity, or end-products that can be visible to naked eyes with fluorescent reagents such as SYBR Green I (Tomita et al., 2008).",
