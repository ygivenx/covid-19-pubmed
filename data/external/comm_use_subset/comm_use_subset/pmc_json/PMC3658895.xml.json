More importantly, stakeholder engagement increases the likelihood that findings will be relevant to stakeholders and more readily adopted into practice, thereby making the overall research pipeline more efficient. These \u201cevaluability assessments\u201d [8] or participatory approaches are considered key to facilitating the adoption of research findings by practitioners [9]. The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), for example, is creating public advisory groups and soliciting patient input on specific comparative effectiveness questions that are relevant to practitioners and stakeholders [10].",

This belabored research process typically begins with pilot trials that we posit have limited benefit, are used inappropriately to estimate effect size [14], and often prematurely concretize a less than optimal intervention. Instead, we recommend replacing the traditional pilot trial with a more flexible iterative intervention testing and optimization approach, analogous to the agile software development process that places a premium on failing early to succeed later [15]. For example, N-of-1 trial designs provide intervention development flexibility. With the increasing availability of intensive longitudinal data from wireless sensors and mobile devices, N-of-1 trials can be rapidly implemented and provide results congruent with a more personalized medicine approach [16], and Bayesian analyses from a series of such trials [17] may provide sufficient evidence of generalizability to limit the need for a larger trial.",

The Minimal Intervention Needed for Change (MINC) standard [20] provides a standard pragmatic comparison anchor across studies for comparative effectiveness research. The VA is adopting a \u201cpoint of care\u201d randomization that computer-randomizes patients to different treatments, and then uses adaptive algorithms to change allocation of new patients as evidence accumulates [21]. Recent technological advances make it possible to conduct \u201cautomated RCTs\u201d in which the enrollment, random assignment, intervention delivery, and outcome assessments are fully automated. To fully realize the potential of automated RCTs and other rapid learning systems, the nature of and procedures for informed consent need to be resolved.",

The health system has lagged decades behind other sectors in IT implementation [35]. As a result, health research has been severely constrained by a data-poor environment in which acquiring needed research data is expensive, difficult, and time-consuming. Since the rapid-learning health system and learning healthcare system concepts were advanced in 2007 [36], major investments have been made in databases and learning networks to take advantage of the research potential of electronic health records. It is now possible to conduct some studies in weeks or months instead of years. The FDA mini-Sentinel system accesses 125 million patient records to generate several studies per week on drug safety questions [37]. Large biobanks are now coming on-line at Kaiser-Permanente, [38] the Veterans Health Administration [39], the ENCODE network, [40], and the UK Biobank [41]. Using these and other patient databases, researchers have been able to assess the unintended effects of treatments [42] and produce outcome findings comparable to RCTs [43].",

This call to streamline and speed the research process is also likely to be met with skepticism, especially among those who fear that methodological rigor might be compromised in a quest for greater efficiency. We believe that the recommendations outlined in this paper can be achieved without compromising scientific rigor, and any efforts to streamline research should be judged based on methodological soundness.
