            "text": "The negative binomial (NB) distribution has broad applications as a model for count data, particularly for data exhibiting overdispersion (i.e. with sample variance exceeding the mean). In the biological literature, classical uses of the NB distribution include analysis of parasite loads, species occurrence, parasitoid attacks, abundance samples and spatial clustering of populations [1]\u2013[7]. The range of applications of the NB distribution was extended recently to include the epidemiology of directly-transmitted infections, as the NB distribution was shown to be a suitable model for the \u2018offspring distribution\u2019 for a number of disease transmission datasets [8]. The offspring distribution, a concept arising in the theory of branching processes [9], is the probability distribution for the number of individuals (termed \u2018secondary cases\u2019) infected directly by each infectious individual in a disease outbreak. Estimation of NB parameters for empirical offspring distributions revealed a high degree of overdispersion\u2014particularly for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), measles, and smallpox\u2014signalling an unexpectedly large influence of individual variation and \u2018superspreading\u2019 on the dynamics of disease emergence [8]. However, the authors emphasized the challenges inherent in estimating NB parameters and the confidence intervals (CIs) associated with those estimates, and noted that previous work on NB parameter estimation had not explored the parameter ranges of interest for epidemiological studies. A particular concern is whether the results were influenced by small sample size in the datasets analyzed, or biases peculiar to disease transmission data. This study uses simulated data to assess the bias and precision of NB parameter estimates and the coverage accuracy of CIs for highly overdispersed datasets, addressing the challenges of small datasets as well as potential biases arising in the data collection process.",

The distribution is commonly expressed in terms of the mean m and dispersion parameter k such that the probability of observing a non-negative integer x is1The variance of the NB distribution is m (1+m/k), and hence decreasing values of k correspond to increasing levels of dispersion. The Poisson distribution is obtained as k\u2192\u221e, and the logarithmic series distribution is obtained as k\u21920 [1], [10]. When k = 1, the NB distribution reduces to the geometric distribution. Note that recent work in the statistical literature uses the quantity \u03b1 = 1/k due to its preferable properties for inference (discussed below), but studies applying the NB distribution in ecology and epidemiology are overwhelmingly posed in terms of k. Accordingly, all calculations in this study were conducted using \u03b1, but all results and discussion are posed in terms of k.

Many simulation studies have examined the efficacy of different estimators of NB parameters for finite datasets [11], [13]\u2013[16], [17; also see review in 14], but owing to precedent most of these have focused on k\u22651 and hence do not apply to highly overdispersed data. One biologically motivated study did explore values of k<1 [16], but it did not test the maximum-likelihood (ML) methods of estimation that have become standard owing to their asymptotic efficiency and low bias [12], [13], [17]. The small-sample accuracy of ML estimates of k has not been tested for NB distributions with moderate to high degrees of overdispersion. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the accuracy of CIs of such NB parameter estimates. The first aim of this study, therefore, is to investigate the bias, precision and CI coverage accuracy of ML estimates of k for small samples. The investigation focuses on datasets with k<1, to address the gap in existing studies, but results for k\u22651 are included to establish continuity with earlier work.",

Empirical offspring distributions can be constructed by counting the number of secondary cases infected by the first infectious individual in each outbreak, but ignoring all subsequent generations of transmission (which often are not reported in detail, or may be influenced by outbreak control measures). The resulting datasets are analogous to many other datasets in biology, compiling many independent records of unrelated events. Datasets of this type can be affected by two broad classes of under-counting error. First, data points may be underestimated, due to the possibility that some of the secondary cases will be overlooked, misdiagnosed, or not traced to the individual that infected them. Second, individuals who do not transmit the disease may be more likely to be missed by surveillance programs, because they do not initiate a cluster of cases and thus are less likely to attract the attention of health authorities. Therefore instances of a particular value (i.e. x = 0, for no secondary cases) may be systematically under-counted in the surveillance samples. These two classes of under-counting error are common to many types of biological data [e.g. 18], [19], [20].",

            "text": "Outbreak datasets, comprising the second category of disease transmission data, are more unique to epidemiology and disease ecology. Offspring distributions drawn from outbreak data include the number of secondary cases caused by many individuals within a single disease outbreak. These datasets arise when several generations of epidemic spread (typically early in an outbreak, before control measures are imposed) are fully reconstructed by contact tracing, so the number of secondary cases caused by each infectious case can be determined. Lloyd-Smith et al. [8] showed that when the degree of infectiousness is highly overdispersed (e.g. when the offspring distribution is NB with k<1), many outbreaks will die out stochastically in their first few generations of spread. In such situations, the outbreaks that survive tend to be those where a highly infectious individual (i.e. an individual whose number of secondary cases is drawn from the right-hand tail of the offspring distribution) appears in the early generations [8]. Because outbreak datasets necessarily are drawn from successful outbreaks, there is the possibility of selection bias for an increased proportion of exceptionally infectious individuals, or \u2018superspreaders\u2019 [21]. Intuitively, this risk appears to be particularly acute for offspring distributions with lower mean values, for which the epidemic's growth is more dependent on chance. (Note that the mean of the offspring distribution corresponds to the basic reproduction number R\n0 of the disease [8], [22]).",

Each of these second-generation cases infects xi other individuals, where the xi are independent and identically distributed draws from the same NB offspring distribution; the number of cases in the third generation is then . This process was repeated until the cumulative number of cases exceeded n, and the xi values corresponding to the first n infectious cases were used as the simulated outbreak dataset. To mirror the selection bias in using real outbreak datasets of a given size, outbreaks were simulated repeatedly until the cumulative number of cases was n or higher. Outbreaks that died out with fewer than n total cases were not used. Large outbreaks were less likely when m<1, particularly for k>1 where extremely infectious individuals (who cause large superspreading events) were very rare. No results were reported for parameter sets for which fewer than 1 in 105 simulated outbreaks had n cases or more.

First, use of the reciprocal avoids discontinuities for homogeneous datasets, because increasing homogeneity yields \u03b1\u21920 instead of k\u2192\u221e. Indeed, there is a continuous transition to values \u03b1<0 corresponding to underdispersion (when sample variance is less than the mean), for which direct estimation of k is problematic [14], [25].

Estimates of \u03b1\u0302 were restricted to positive values, because the allowed range for k was (0,\u221e). Underdispersed datasets were assigned the minimum value of \u03b1\u0302, corresponding to k\u2192\u221e. This approximation is reasonable because the study focuses on highly overdispersed NB distributions (with k<1); estimation of \u03b1\u0302 for underdispersed data is discussed in-depth elsewhere [14], [15], [17], [25]. The ML estimate of m is the sample mean, x \u00af [10]. The ML estimate of \u03b1 was determined by unidimensional numerical maximization of the log-likelihood function [15], conducted using the fminbnd function of Matlab 6.1 over the interval (0.001,1000). The termination tolerance was set sufficiently small that negligible accuracy was lost in inverting the estimates, and direct ML estimates of k (obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood function derived from equation (1)) matched k\u0302 = 1/\u03b1\u0302 to beyond the fourth decimal place. Reported estimates of k\u0302 thus are drawn from the range (0.001,1000), which is much broader than the range of k commonly estimated from epidemiological data (e.g. the range of k\u0302 was [0.032,5.1] in 11 uncontrolled outbreak datasets [8], or [0.038,6.014] in 49 macroparasite burden datasets [4]). NB distributions with k = 1000 and k\u2192\u221e (the Poisson distribution) are indistinguishable in practice.",

The positive bias in k arises because smaller samples are less likely to include values from the right-hand tail of the NB distribution, without which the dataset appears more homogeneous. Estimates of k\u0302 were less biased and more precise for larger values of m, possibly because such datasets had higher total numbers of non-zero events. Estimates were more biased and less precise for higher values of k (particularly in the previously-studied range of k\u22651), corresponding to the known instability of ML estimates when data are closer to being fitted by a Poisson distribution [13]. Intuitively, this effect arises because a NB distribution with k = 10 is qualitatively similar to one with k = 50 or k\u2192\u221e, and quite dissimilar to one with k = 1, so the range of k\u0302 estimates for small samples tends to be large and skewed upwards.",

The true coverage of the nominal 90% intervals was typically less than 90%, and CI overestimates were much more numerous than CI underestimates. For all parameter sets considered, <5% of CIs had upper bounds below the true value of k. The realized coverage of the CIs is driven by the interplay of two factors: the value of the estimates, k\u0302, and the breadth of the intervals (determined by the sampling variance, ). The upward bias of k\u0302 increases for lower values of n and m and higher values of k; lower values of n, m, or k lead to increases in  and hence broader intervals. Overestimates of k\u0302 favor CI overestimates by setting a high mid-point for the estimated intervals, and by reducing the estimated sampling variance (because  is calculated with an inflated value of k) and thus leading to narrower intervals. The gross patterns in the frequency of CI overestimates thus are driven primarily by patterns of bias in k\u0302.",

Recall that intervals were estimated for \u03b1 = 1/k as [\u03b1\u0302\u2212z\n0.95\u03c3\u03b1\u0302, \u03b1\u0302+z\n0.95\u03c3\u03b1\u0302], then converted into intervals for k. CI underestimates for k occur when \u03b1<\u03b1\u0302\u2212z\n0.95\u03c3\u03b1\u0302. The complete absence of CI underestimates in many small-n parameter sets arises because \u03b1\u0302<z\n0.95\u03c3\u03b1\u0302 such that the lower bound of the CI for \u03b1\u0302 is <0. In these instances, the upper bound of the CI for k\u0302 is set to the maximum value for k\u0302 and cannot be exceeded. As n, m, or k increases, \u03c3\u03b1\u0302 decreases and the CIs narrow such that some CI underestimates occur. Similarly, CI overestimates occur when \u03b1>\u03b1\u0302+z\n0.95\u03c3\u03b1\u0302. As k increases, CI overestimates become less frequent (despite the high frequency of k\u0302 overestimates) because \u03b1 = 1/k is often smaller than z\n0.95\u03c3\u03b1\u0302. Because \u03b1\u0302 is constrained to positive values in these simulations, CI overestimates are impossible when \u03b1<z\n0.95\u03c3\u03b1\u0302. Accordingly, for given values of k>1, CI overestimates are more frequent for higher values of n and m (corresponding to lower values of \u03c3\u03b1\u0302). This study's focus on overdispersed datasets, and hence on the positive values of k familiar to biologists, has thus influenced the determination of CI coverage in some regions of parameter space. Estimation procedures allowing for underdispersed data (\u03b1\u0302<0) may show different results. Investigators requiring CIs guaranteed to reach nominal levels of coverage should consult the literature on exact CIs for discrete distributions [e.g. 26].",

In uniform under-counting, each instance of the quantity being counted (e.g. secondary cases, in the epidemiological context) can be overlooked with equal probability pu. The expected value of each datum xi in the raw dataset (drawn from an NB distribution with parameters m and k) is reduced to (1\u2212pu) xi, and the resulting distribution is NB with parameters (1\u2212pu) m and k (as argued under the topic of \u2018population-wide control measures\u2019 by Lloyd-Smith et al.

Indeed, outbreak estimates had slightly smaller bias and greater precision for smaller n, probably because the use of outbreak data (biased toward including high-xi events) counteracts the usual small-sample bias (which arises because small datasets often lack high-xi events).

This is unsurprising because the minimum value of m\u0302 for an outbreak with n cases is (n\u22121)/n (for an outbreak that dies out immediately following the n\nth case), while higher values are quite feasible. (Recall that m\u0302 is estimated as the mean number of secondary cases generated by the first n cases in an outbreak, regardless of whether the outbreak continues beyond n cases. If the cumulative number of cases after the r\nth generation of transmission is j, then the mean value of xi for i = 1 to j is (j\u22121)/j. If the n\nth case then occurs in the (r+1)th generation of transmission, then all infections caused by the final n\u2212j individuals in the dataset (i.e. xi for i = j+1 to n) serve to inflate m\u0302 above its minimum value of (n\u22121)/n.) The greatest bias in m\u0302 occurs for low k and n, when large superspreading events in the final generation can have disproportionate effect on the sample mean. For m = 1.0, the bias decreases as n increases, probably because higher-n datasets involve more generations of disease transmission, so the \u2018left-over\u2019 cases of the final generation (i.e. the final n\u2212j individuals in the example above) make a smaller proportional contribution. For m = 3.0, there is no substantial bias for any parameters (with a minor exception for k = 0.1 and n = 10).",

This study has focused on ML estimation only, and it would be fruitful to extend the conclusions to other methods of estimating k, such as maximum quasi-likelihood [14], method-of-moments with small-sample correction [16], or bias-corrected ML [17]. Further studies on estimation of m\u0302 will be interesting, particularly in the epidemiological context where the mean of the offspring distribution is equivalent to the crucial quantity R\n0\n[8], [22]. In particular, it will be important to learn how the overdispersion observed in disease transmission data [8] influences estimation of R\n0 from continuous-time outbreak data such as daily case reports [28], [29], as opposed to estimation directly from known chains of transmission as assessed here. Overdispersed offspring distributions cause outbreaks to either die out stochastically or grow explosively [8], so estimation of R\n0 from daily case reports (of successful outbreaks only, necessarily) may exhibit bias beyond that shown in Figure 4b.",

There is substantial risk of overestimating k, particularly when sample sizes are small or the zero-class is systematically under-counted. All of the systematic biases identified in this study favored higher values of k\u0302, and instances when confidence intervals excluded the true value k were predominantly overestimates. Note that an independent risk of underestimating k can arise from pooling data from heterogeneous groups: the dispersion parameter estimated from pooled data is nearly always less than the average of values estimated for the individual groups [11], [16]. Regarding sample sizes for NB datasets with k\u22641, n = 100 or more allows accurate and precise ML estimation of k\u0302, while for n = 30 the median estimates showed minimal bias but the sampling distribution skewed to high values. A sample size of 10 yields unreliable estimates, particularly for m\u22641. These findings will help guide prospective design of sampling regimens, or, when sample size cannot be increased, will aid investigators in understanding the limitations of ML estimates of k\u0302 and associated CIs.",
