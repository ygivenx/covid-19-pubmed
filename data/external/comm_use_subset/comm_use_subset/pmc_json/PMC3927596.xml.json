But does this reflect reality? What would be the opposite of fragile? In a recent piece for Edge magazine [1] Nassim Taleb discussed another familiar attribute of life, tinkering. There he asserted that, contrary to the favored emphasis on intelligent engineering, \u201ctinkering outperforms design\u201d. This property enables finding unexpected solutions, especially when challenged by \u201cnormal accidents\u201d [2], rare deleterious events (in terms of individual probability of occurrence) for which he himself coined the phrase \u201cBlack Swan\u201d events [3].",

Tinkering is indeed at the core of life [8]. The biological evolution of unusual structures and processes in response to extreme environments or other types of challenges is ubiquitous. We explore various facets of this notion and see whether it might help us better understand the behavior and evolution of living organisms. In this context, tinkering derives from unexpected (undesigned) properties that are put in action under stressful or difficult circumstances.",

The expected fate of the entity is sealed: either it hardens for some time, stays the same or it breaks down. Should we extend this view to define a possibly new concept, antifragility? To define antifragility, Taleb opposes the fragility of the Damocles' Sword not to the robustness of the Phoenix (who rises from the ashes), but to the inventiveness of the Hydra (who gets two heads each time one is cut off). Is it possible to think of entities that would not just resist the ravages of time but, through the creation and recombination of novel components, actually become able to cope with an unpredictable future? More generally, can we identify processes that make an entity stronger (sturdier) through the effect of ageing, shock or stress?",

This property is at the root of our models of evolution. We use dichotomies to construct the Tree of Life. Of course, many (most) branches are cut off forever\u2014and the Greek Hydra is not an immortal animal\u2014but in the succession of generations, antifragile life tends to expand its exploration of the world by generating a systematic creation of novelty. This is illustrated by the huge number of new life forms that flourish following mass extinctions. On shorter time scales, we know well that it takes only a few months before anticancer drugs are defeated by cells trying to become immortal. In the same way, resistance to an antibiotic follows shortly after its introduction. Moreover, resistance does not simply result from horizontal gene transfers, using some hidden form of pre-existing resistance, but, quite often, from the emergence of a completely novel activity. For example, while the precursor of Nylon\u00ae never existed before the creation of this man-made polymer, it did not take long to find bacteria that used it as a nitrogen and carbon source [9]. The enzymes involved have been created de novo from apparently random pieces of DNA [10]. In the same way, emerging diseases are often the progeny of pre-existing diseases. The SARS coronavirus evolved a novel surface antigen [11], and the Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain assembled traits that were distributed in the environment with a completely different pattern [12]. Evolution, then, should be reconsidered in this new light. Living systems are antifragile in that they can do much more than simply respond to the \u201cpressure\u201d of the environment by random mutations followed by selection; they have an in-built property that allows them to find solutions in the face of adversity. Antifragility is one such property. It unfolds not only in individual organisms, which age much slower than what could be expected from a fragile entity, but also in the way they generate a progeny. All these processes have in common the ability to create some novel information: antifragility cannot be separated from management of information [13].",

Rather than study multicellular organisms, where a variety of cells with complicated hierarchies display the functions of life, possibly hiding important underlying principles, we restrict our views to unicellular organisms, bacteria. We first recount the core functions, emphasizing their relative position in the process of ageing. We focus on \u201csteady state\u201d or \u201cstationary\u201d life, which we see as differing from senescence, the continuous degradation of the cell's components as time elapses (in human beings the analogous ageing-before-senescence stage would be roughly between ages 25 and 50). Subsequently we explore the process of antifragility [14] (without bothering to carry over likely challenges about the novelty of the concept) using a specific molecular example. Choosing among a variety of antifragile processes, we discuss the existence of (literally) flexible proteins and the processes in which they participate. We show how this could help delay the senescence process, providing an example of how tinkering and antifragility work together during ageing. The final discussion recapitulates the possible roles of these processes in biology at the cellular level, focusing on the stationary regime.",

Nutrients are imported and waste products are exported. In parallel, the cell monitors its sensors. Two types of sensing are used: sensing the physical state of the environment (temperature, light, pressure, etc) and sensing chemicals. The physical constraints cannot be neglected. Except in homeothermic organisms, changes of environmental temperature are immediately passed on to the organism. Because the effects of temperature on macromolecules are often similar to those of ageing (misfolding is the consequence of both changes), there may be considerable overlap between sensing ageing and sensing temperature variations. Indeed, molecular chaperones have both the role of sensors and of maintenance systems and they belong to the heat shock response [20]. Hence, because these molecules must act on a large number of substrates, we may assume that functions fulfilled by molecular chaperones are to be executed in priority in stationary life.",

Fortunately, turnover of metabolites and salvage processes minimize the need to resort to the environment for their supply. Salvage is not a heavy-duty process. Although necessary, it should not belong to the first-line protection because few functional molecules of the corresponding enzymes are needed in the salvage process (this is akin to the marginal cost of a process in the financial world). Similarly, the time-dependent decay of most functions involved in transport of chemicals into the cell can be compensated for through considerable redundancy. The cell only needs to transport a few categories of products: amino acids, simple carbohydrates or dicarboxylates, polyamines, vitamins and ions. This is readily observed in the organisms that can live with a very low number of genes such as Mycoplasma genitalium [21]. Redundancy in the function of transporters, either pre-existing or resulting from the process of ageing, will limit the number needed to be conserved in the long term. Overall, in contrast with the front-line requirement for molecular chaperones, there is no heavy-duty requirement for these functions that may slowly deteriorate over time without dramatic consequences.",

This requires the continued use of the global biosynthetic capacity of the cell. Unfortunately, the identification of essential ubiquitous functions is somewhat difficult, as they cannot be solely identified using comparative genomics. While functions may be ubiquitous, enzyme structures are not [22]. In the present work we used sets of persistent genes [23] to identify the essential functions for stationary life. Consider a bacterium after it has entered stationary phase. RNAs are expected to turn over first, as they are seldom repaired (see however [24]). This process is managed by the degradosome and related activities [25]. The degradosome structure (exosome in Archaea and Eukarya) is highly diverse, being different in gamma-Proteobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, for example [26]. It always contains polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) at its core: This enzyme uses phosphorolysis rather than hydrolysis, generating nucleoside diphosphates instead of nucleoside monophosphates as basic building blocks for nucleic acids, followed by the recovery of one quantum of energy [27]. Associated to PNPase we find a variety of ribonucleases of different descent, such as RNase E in gamma-Proteobacteria or RNase J and RNase Y in Firmicutes [28], energy-dependent helicases, as well as core enzymes of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway [25]. We also find co-evolving proteins meant to degrade leftovers, such as nanoRNases of various families, depending on the phylogenetic clade [29].",

            "text": "A puzzling observation stems out from the composition of the degradosome: Many of its functions are carried out by proteins that are significantly longer than average bacterial proteins (300 residues). This is counter-intuitive because the synthesis of long proteins is expected to be fragile. The probability of transcription/translation errors, especially the premature termination of translation, is proportional to the length of the messenger RNA. Moreover, it is well known that truncated proteins in complexes display a negative-dominant phenotype [30]. However, the significance of this bias is supported by further observations. RNA turnover implies that the first anabolic function that must be preserved is transcription, because any requirement for re-synthesized macromolecules will first go through this step. RNA polymerase is its core component. Surprisingly, it involves two very large subunits (more than 1,300 residues), RpoB and RpoC. This might have just been a statistical coincidence, but an experiment shows that length is significant. Bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, which thrive in difficult environments, fuse RpoB and RpoC into a single gigantic protein. Splitting it back into two components makes the cell sensitive to the denaturing agent urea, showing that premature termination followed by re-initiation is not an option for recovery [31]. Other important components of the machinery are also large, e.g., NusA [32] or the transcription-repair factor Mfd [33]. Is there a special property, associated with increased length that could compensate for the fragility of synthesis of long molecules?",

Many energy-dependent proteases have been characterized, including Clp, Lon, and FtsH (HflB) in E. coli. Clp proteases are degradation machines composed of a sensor required for both substrate recognition and ATP-dependent selection for unfolding, and of a peptidase made of multiple subunits, required for substrate hydrolysis (see e.g., [38]). Clp proteases (ClpP) use the ATPase subunits to choose between folded and unfolded substrates. The importance of choosing (i.e., collecting information on) the substrate to be degraded is illustrated by the unexpected role of a novel class of antibiotics, acyldepsipeptides, that are active against ClpP. The acyldepsipeptide-activated ClpP core initiates proteolytic degradation without the control exerted by Clp-ATPases. This unchecked activity, which demonstrates that the energy of ATP is not used in the very process of protein hydrolysis, leads to the inhibition of bacterial cell division and eventually cell death [39]. Again, these proteins, essential during stationary life, are long.",

In this challenging situation the cell has two choices: either its components will steadily accumulate malfunction, resulting in the error catastrophe [44], or the cell will find a solution where, provided that there are enough representatives of a given particular entity, variants will emerge, some of them ready to provide a relief to the stress induced over time.",

For living organisms this could act at the level of the population of organisms, the population of cells, or the population of intracellular molecules. We explore here how antifragility could operate at the molecular level, noting that its implementation has features highly reminiscent of what we call natural selection. Antifragility gathers and utilizes information [13] in the process of allowing some individual entities to stand out from the bulk and thus improving the fate of a population under a challenging situation. The number of obvious candidates for antifragile behavior among biological processes is enormous. We choose here to illustrate one of them, protein ageing, using a few specific structural features.",

However, in addition to being more flexible, long proteins display remarkable structural features. Longer proteins can fulfill more easily than short ones the requirements for unfolding and misfolding stability, because they have a higher number of native interactions per residue. They are also relatively enriched in small amino acid residues. Furthermore, there is a correlation between the tendency to misfold and protein hydrophobicity, with long proteins being less hydrophobic than short ones [53]. Interestingly, when hydrophobicity is low, long proteins are more resistant to unfolding and misfolding than short proteins [54]. The collapse of unfolded polypeptides, generally believed to be driven by hydrophobic forces, is an early event in the folding of a protein. Whether hydrogen bonds and side chains play a significant role in the process has been an open question. This has recently been addressed by demonstrating that the backbone displays a considerable organizing role [55]. It seems important therefore that flexibility be a core feature of proteins involved in stationary conditions. Before discussing in more depth the way antifragility may exploit flexibility, we explore some features of flexible regions, which might be a trait selected in proteins that must solve new functional questions while ageing.",

Post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications show that some metabolism-dependent changes are genetically programmed. At the same time, basal metabolism is required to allow the cell to maintain its activity. Many metabolites are not innocuous. Some have intrinsic reactivity: dicarbonyls (including reducing carbohydrates) react with accessible amino groups resulting in glycation [56] and respiration produces free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) that modify nucleic acids and proteins. The role of ROS is often perceived as negative. However, in addition to being a potential threat to cellular integrity, ROS are also used in a programmed way by the cell, for example in insects, where ROS-triggered protein alteration is required for the formation of the exoskeleton [57]. In the same way, laccase is involved in formation of the spore coat defense in Bacillus subtilis [58]. Superoxide is essential for longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans [59] and there is evidence in mice that several oncogenes actively promote a ROS detoxification program that is required for tumour initiation [60]. This raises questions such as: Is the ROS-dependent modification of a common amino acid, such as methionine oxidation, programmed or accidental [61,62]?

This allows the protein to change its interaction with relevant control mediators, at a pre-set time. Clocks are central devices in information processing. In particular they allow parallel processes the opportunity to synchronize. Accurate timing requires the presence of a stable clock-an unlikely feature of living cells-but cooperation of many inaccurate clocks may result in defining a proper timing [75], possibly to tell cells that they have to start expressing new regulatory pathways or initiate replication.

In the same way, repair systems are made of long proteins, and these proteins need to avoid the damages of age because they are essential to prevent premature death [76].

L-succinimide will either hydrolyse into L-isoaspartate spontaneously or after methylation (in 2/3 of the cases), or L-aspartate (in 1/3 of the cases). Subsequently, L-succinimide will isomerise into D-succinimide at a slow rate, and then lead to formation of D-isoaspartate and D-aspartate residues. As a consequence, proteins with flexible regions containing aspartate or asparagine residues will considerably change over time, leading to multiple states, depending on the past history of the protein. Remarkably, the beta subunit of RNA polymerase contains conserved AsnGly motifs. Because of the cost of resynthesising the protein, if destined to become rapidly non-functional after cyclisation-deamidation, these motifs should have been genetically rejected rather than preferred, unless deamidation is of positive biological value. In the same way, aspartates modified by phosphorylation or methylation are also prone to cyclisation. This may lead to loss of activity, creation of novel functional properties, such as regulatory properties or novel catalytic features (reviewed in [73]).",

However, this is extremely costly and should be limited to some rare situations when it is better to lose energy than control. This cannot be the rule, and inevitable time-dependent changes in macromolecules provide good reasons to suspect that some have been recruited for being functional in the long run, and even to alter their function in a context-related positive direction, allowing them to display antifragile features.

This way, the cell could learn and memorize a particular moment in its history, and fixate it so that it could be recalled later on when similar conditions appear. Antifragility would thus be a way to implement a form of epigenetic memory and contribute to the overall mechanisms of network epistasis [50]. In the present context it has properties similar to those used in the market of financial derivatives: the cell develops a diverse population of molecules of processes such that, under challenging conditions, one or more will emerge and improve the cell's fate in a much better way than a uniform population would have [14]. At this point, an aged cell, when facing suddenly a medium where it could reproduce, would initiate a round of replication.

The cell is constantly in the midst of a huge network of interacting partners. This constitutes an evolving graph. Can we identify some order in the graph? An important feature of large interaction graphs is that they comply with Ramsey's theory, which states that a sufficiently large system, no matter how random, must contain highly organized subsystems [79]. Antifragility is context- dependent. But there is no means for an antifragile structure to know whether the constraints that made it evolve came from the outside or from the inside. Antifragile structures and processes that would change state when some order is reached could memorize a diagram of that particular order. In this way, once time has taken its toll on the organism, a network of interactions would have been created via antifragile modifications of multiple elements, allowing it to trigger re-synthesis of some components that would fit in place in the graph, because the interaction graph itself would play the role of the original situation that enabled its creation.",
