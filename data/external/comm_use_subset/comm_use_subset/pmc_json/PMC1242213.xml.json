In a more targeted approach, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify a particular subset of sequences, which can then be cloned and analyzed. For example, 16S rRNA sequences are frequently used to identify bacterial and archaeal species [9-12]. Another approach is based on functional screening of shotgun expression libraries to identify DNA fragments that encode proteins with desirable activities [13-15].",

            "text": "Use of DNA microarrays in metagenomics introduces a series of analytical challenges. First, the sequence space to explore may be very large, especially in the case of environmental samples. Given the technologic constraints on the total number of probes that can be placed on a microarray, improved algorithms are required for optimal probe selection to maximize coverage. Second, microarray data generated in metagenomic studies can be very complex. In the case of viral diagnostics, nucleic acid extracted from clinical specimens usually contains host and bacterial contaminants in addition to viral RNA and DNA. As a result, hybridization patterns are complicated by substantial amounts of noise introduced by specific and nonspecific cross-hybridization that cannot be anticipated or controlled. Third, multiple and potentially closely related species may be present in a single sample, resulting in complex or even overlapping hybridization patterns. Finally, a species identification strategy based on the use of experimentally derived patterns alone is not feasible, because such empirical controls can be obtained only for a limited number of species available as pure cultures or genomic clones. New analytical tools capable of overcoming these challenges are acutely needed.",

Briefly, the platform employs a spotted 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray containing approximately 11,000 oligonucleotides, which represent the most conserved sequences from 954 distinct viruses corresponding to every NCBI reference viral genome available at the time of design. Nucleic acids are extracted from a sample of interest, typically a clinical specimen, and are amplified and labeled using random-primed reverse transcription, second strand synthesis, and PCR. The labeled DNA is then hybridized to the microarray, and hybridization patterns are analyzed to identify particular viruses that are present in the sample.",

This set of profiles included all viruses represented on the microarray and many viruses whose genomes became available after the array design had been completed. All microarray oligonucleotides expected to hybridize to a given viral genome were identified using nucleotide BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) alignment [28]. Free energy of hybridization (\u0394G) was then computed for each alignment using the nearest neighbor method [29,30]. Oligonucleotides that failed to produce a BLAST alignment were assumed to have hybridization energies equal to zero. Thus, a given theoretical energy profile consists of the non-zero hybridization energies calculated for the subset of oligonucleotides producing a BLAST alignment to the corresponding genome. Collectively, the energy profiles of all the viruses constitute a sparsely populated energy matrix, in which each row corresponds to a viral species and each column corresponds to an oligonucleotide from the microarray (Figure 1b).",

The performance of each combination was then evaluated by calculating the separation between the score obtained for the correct (match) virus profile and the best scoring nonmatch profile from either the same or a different virus family (Figure 2a and Figure 2b, respectively). We defined separation as the difference between the similarity scores of a match and the appropriate nonmatch profiles, divided by the range of all similarity scores on a given microarray. Using this statistic, a value of one corresponds to the best possible separation, a value of zero corresponds to no separation, and negative values represent cases in which a match profile is assigned a score lower than a nonmatch profile.",

In addition, changes in normalization and similarity metric had greater impact on intrafamily than on interfamily separation. The best overall separation was determined by calculating the product of the means of the intrafamily and interfamily separations divided by the corresponding standard deviations. Sum normalization of the intensity vectors, quadratic normalization of the energy vectors, and uncentered Pearson correlation as the similarity metric achieved the highest overall separation, producing a mean intrafamily separation of 0.69 (standard deviation 0.17) and a mean interfamily separation of 0.93 (standard deviation 0.08).

Outliers on the right tails of the distributions, assumed to be true positives, were removed (see Materials and methods, below), and parameters of the null distributions were estimated as the mean and standard deviation of the remaining observations. These parameters were used to calculate the probability associated with any observed similarity score.

However, after the entire genome sequence of the virus became available [32], its theoretical energy profile was added to the E-Predict energy matrix. Reanalysis of the original SARS microarray data (NCBI GEO [27], accession GSM8528) using E-Predict revealed that the SARS CoV energy profile attained the highest similarity score and a highly significant P value (P = 1 \u00d7 10-6), despite the fact that the microarray, and therefore the profile, did not contain any oligonucleotides derived from the SARS CoV genome.",

However, these predictions were based on oligonucleotides corresponding to a conserved 3'-untranslated region shared by these viruses with the SARS CoV [23,33]. To identify incorrect predictions, such as these, resulting from partial profile overlaps with a match virus, we implemented an iterative version of E-Predict in which oligonucleotide intensities corresponding to the top scoring profile from one iteration are set to zero before running the next iteration. As a consequence, misleading predictions resulting from oligonucleotides shared with the top scoring profile fail to attain significant similarity scores in subsequent iterations. Conversely, only those predictions that are based on alternative oligonucleotides, namely predictions representing distinct species, remain. When iterative E-Predict was used on the SARS microarray, no astrovirus or picornavirus profile attained a statistically significant score (P > 0.04) in the second iteration, effectively removing these profiles from consideration.

Rhinoviruses are a genus in the picornavirus family, which also includes enterovirus, aphthovirus, cardiovirus, hepatovirus, and parechovirus genera. Partial sequence analysis [34-36] indicates that HRV serotypes can be divided into two major groups (A and B), with the exception of HRV87, which is more closely related to enteroviruses. Only two complete rhinovirus reference genomes are available, one for each group: HRV89 (group A) and HRV14 (group B). Energy profiles of both viruses are included in our energy profile matrix as well as profiles of several enteroviruses and other more distant members of the picornavirus family. RNA samples from cultures of 22 representative serotypes were individually hybridized to the microarray, and the results were analyzed by E-Predict. In the absence of complete genome sequence data and corresponding energy profiles for each of the 22 serotypes, the E-Predict results revealed whether a particular serotype was most similar to HRV89, HRV14, or one of the enterovirus genomes in the energy matrix. To further refine our analysis, we clustered the E-Predict similarity scores from all 22 microarrays across all picornavirus profiles (Figure 4a). The resulting cluster dendrogram of the serotypes exhibited striking similarity to a phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of VP1 capsid protein (Figure 4b; also see Ledford and coworkers [34]). Serotypes 4, 26, 27, 70, and 83 were correctly grouped together on the basis of their similarity to the profile of HRV14 (group B); HRV87 formed a separate node, and the remaining serotypes were grouped together on the basis of their similarity to the profile of HRV89 (group A).

Existing methods have utilized direct visual inspection of hybridizing oligonucleotides [23,37] or inspection following clustering [19,38]. Such methods are intractable for interpreting complex hybridization patterns, are time consuming, and suffer from user bias. Improved data interpretation tools must address several challenges. First, hybridization patterns may represent signal from dozens or even hundreds of species. Also, several closely related species may be present in a sample, giving rise to overlapping hybridization signals. A likely additional source of noise is unanticipated cross-hybridization, because many of the genomes present in a complex sample may be uncharacterized. Finally, obtaining pure samples of each possible species for the purpose of generating reference hybridization patterns is impractical or impossible in most cases.",

In particular, E-Predict does not rely on the use of empirically generated reference hybridization patterns, because species identification is based instead on theoretical hybridization energy profiles. The energy profile matrix currently represents over 1,200 distinct viruses whose complete genomic sequences are known. As new viral genomes are sequenced, profiles are added to the matrix to broaden the range of species detection. For example, addition of the SARS CoV profile enabled accurate identification of the virus, even though no oligonucleotides derived from its genome were present on the microarray. Conversely, even when a perfectly matching profile is not available because of limited sequence coverage, E-Predict will identify the closest related species, as long as such species are represented on the microarray. This feature is particularly useful for detecting novel viruses as well as for discriminating between closely related viruses such as HRV serotypes. Naturally, maximum range and precision of detection is achieved through addition of new profiles and periodic microarray updates to include specific oligonucleotides from newly sequenced species.",

For example, in applications concerned with bacterial species detection, some species may be present in most or even all samples and others encountered only rarely. In this case, a more complicated model will be required to assess whether a specific distribution represents negative, positive, or both negative and positive scores. For example, in cases in which distributions appear bimodal, one mode may represent true negatives and the other true positives.

For example, using a procedure similar to that used to generate null distributions for the virus profile scores, empirical distributions can be obtained for individual oligonucleotide intensities, and individual oligonucleotide contributions may be weighted by the probabilities associated with the corresponding observed intensities.

In this setting, it is important to distinguish between true predictions representing unique species present in the sample and misleading predictions arising from partially overlapping profiles. In each iteration it is assumed that the profile attaining the highest score corresponds to the species most likely to be among those present in the sample. When a novel species is present, this assumption may not hold because of limited oligonucleotide coverage. For instance, in the SARS CoV example, although SARS CoV attained a higher similarity score than mink astrovirus, the corresponding P values were comparable. However, even if mink astrovirus were the top prediction in the first iteration, SARS CoV would be the top prediction in the second iteration (P = 2 \u00d7 10-6; data not shown) and therefore would not be missed as a true positive. In our current studies P values in all iterations are estimated using the same set of null probability distributions. In addition, we use two iterations as our default, and essentially never need to run more than three iterations, because detection of more than two or three viruses is rare. However, iterative resolution of hundreds or thousands of species present in a sample may necessitate other normalization methods or adjustments to the null distributions for P value estimation.

The list also included 137 oligonucleotides obtained by clustering of distributions of sum-normalized intensity, based on the same set of 1,009 hybridizations, and visual identification of an outlier cluster with median sum-normalized intensities significantly higher than those observed for most oligonucleotides. Energy vectors were further filtered to exclude terms with energy predictions higher than -30 kcal/mol (again by setting their values to zero), because such predictions on our platform do not correspond to detectable array intensities [30]. A profile was considered only if it had at least three oligonucleotides with non-zero energy predictions. The resulting intensity and energy vectors were normalized using appropriate normalization methods (no normalization, sum, quadratic, and unit-vector). Similarity scores were computed using an appropriate similarity metric (dot product, Pearson correlation, uncentered Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, and similarity based on Euclidean distance).",

Scores were log-transformed. Right tail outliers corresponding to positive cases were excluded by iterative trimming of the top scores in 1% increments until the best normality fit was obtained, as judged by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test [44] (implemented in R [45]). Trimming was allowed to involve 0-25% of all scores. Over one-third of virus profiles required no trimming at all. Only a small number of profiles (34) required trimming beyond 10%, all of which corresponded to viruses frequently present in our samples. No profile required trimming of more than 17% of the scores. The resulting trimmed distributions were assumed to be normal, and their parameters were estimated as the mean and standard deviation of the included scores (Additional data file 7). Obtained parameters were used to estimate significance of individual scores as probabilities associated with observing values equal or greater than the scores. For this purpose, only profiles with at least three oligonucleotides with raw intensity greater than 100 (about two to four times background) were considered.",
