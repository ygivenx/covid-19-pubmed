Major losses to the broiler meat industry are due to carcass condemnation at processing, a poor feed conversion ratio resulting in poor weight gain, and mortality. IBV is considered a highly infectious agent with near 100% morbidity, and with mortality reaching 10\u201325% [10,11]. In breeder and layer flocks, the major losses are due to reduced egg production during and after infection with IBV. The egg drop during IBV infection has been estimated to be between 3\u201350% [11]. Furthermore, the downgrading of eggs because of a poor internal egg quality and egg shell quality also account for considerable production losses [12]. The standard preventive measures, such as strict quarantine and biosecurity measures [13], do not seem to sufficiently control the disease. Thus far, the most efficient method for controlling IBV is by vaccination [14]. The immunization of chickens against IBV is mainly by live attenuated and killed vaccines [15]. However, the emergence of variant IBV strains/serotypes arising from vaccinated flocks, among other factors, has led to vaccine failure and IB outbreaks. Thus, the development of novel approaches as an alternative or adjunct in order to control the current measures against IBV is becoming increasingly important.",

            "text": "Toll-Like receptor (TLR)s are a family of germ line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on the surface or within the endosomal compartments of cells [16]. These receptors are crucial for recognizing whole or segments of microbial pathogens, and they initiate key host immune defenses against inciting agents. Among the TLRs, TLR9 (in mammals)/TLR21 (in birds) are the only receptors capable of distinguishing bacterial, parasitic, and viral DNA containing cytosine-guanosine (CpG) motifs [17]. Several studies have demonstrated the immunostimulatory and therapeutic success of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) application in various host\u2013pathogen interaction models [18,19,20]. The protection provided by CpG ODNs against lethal challenges of extracellular bacteria, such as Escherichia coli [18] and Salmonella Typhimurium [19], and viruses, such as low pathogenic avian influenza virus [20] and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) [21,22], in chickens have been well documented. CpG ODNs are known to induce an array of cytokines; chemokines; and effecter molecules, such as interferon (IFN) \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and nitric oxide (NO) [23,24,25]. These effecter molecules are believed to play a pivotal role in protecting the host against intra and extra cellular pathogens. Whilst activating a variety of immune cells, it plays an integral role in bridging the innate immune system with the adaptive immune system directing immune responses toward T helper (Th)1 response [26].",

Additionally, the authors saw a significant reduction in the IBV nuclear (N) gene mRNA expression in various embryonic tissues pre-treated with CpG ODNs, compared with the control, highlighting the value of CpG ODN treatment in IBV control. However, they did not demonstrate whether the in ovo CpG ODN delivery is effective against the IBV challenge encountered post-hatch. In this study, we determined whether the CpG ODNs delivered in ovo could provide protection against a post-hatch IBV challenge. Furthermore, we looked into several cytokines and immune cells that may be activated with such protection. We found that in ovo delivery was protective against IBV challenge post hatch, suggesting a potential lasting protective effect of CpG ODNs towards IBV infection, which could be exploited for developing control measures.",

In ovo delivery targets the deposition of CpG ODNs in the amniotic cavity. Subsequently, the ingestion of CpG ODNs containing amniotic fluid by the developing embryo distributes CpG ODNs in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, leading to immune cell recruitment in these two body systems [22]. We have shown in this study that CpG ODNs when delivered in ovo are capable of protecting young chickens against a post-hatch IBV infection induced IB. In ovo CpG ODN-treated birds displayed reduced IBV viral loads in the lungs and a decreased IBV replication and pathology in the trachea, which is associated with high survival rates and low morbidity. We found that the macrophages in the trachea and CD4+ and CD8\u03b1+ T cells in the lungs play important roles in this process, as increases in these cells were observed in the in ovo CpG ODNs treated group. Lastly, we saw an up-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in the in ovo CpG ODN pre-treated lungs, suggesting the critical role of this cytokine in the in ovo CpG ODN-induced clearance of IBV infection.",

In the current study, the protection-mediated by the in ovo administered CpG ODNs was associated with significantly lower IBV replication in the trachea and IBV genome loads in the lungs at 3 and 7 dpi. Consequently, the IBV genome loads in the oro-pharyngeal swabs were significantly reduced at 3 and 7 dpi. However, we did not observe a significant reduction in the IBV genome loads in the cloacal swabs at 3 and 7 dpi, because of the high variability of the IBV genome loads within the control ODN pre-treated group. It is difficult to explain why we observed a discrepancy in the IBV genome loads between the oro-pharyngeal and cloacal swabs, as the in ovo delivered CpG ODNs have been shown to recruite immune cells into the gastrointestinal mucosa [22].",

Previously, we saw that the in ovo delivered CpG ODNs increased the macrophages in the trachea at one day of age [21,22]. This macrophage recruitment to the trachea is associated with a lower IBV replication in the tissue, and it is possible that the CpG ODN-mediated increase of the macrophages seen in the trachea in this study, played a central role in limiting the viral replication by three possible mechanisms. First, these cells may have efficiently and rapidly phagocytized the virus-infected cells and aided in virus elimination. Second, they may have alerted the adaptive immune system to the invasion via active antigen presentation to the T cells. Third, it may have contributed to the T and B cell activation and proliferation through the release of cytokines [30,31].",

Interestingly, we saw an expansion of the CD8\u03b1+ T cell population, but not the CD4+ T cell population in the in ovo CpG ODN pre-treated-IBV infected lungs. Although a portion of this increase of CD8\u03b1+ cell recruitment could be potentially attributable to the IBV specific CD8+ T cells, we did not determine whether these CD8\u03b1+ T cells are in deed IBV specific. We are at a loss as to why we did not see a similar CD4+ and CD8\u03b1+ T cell response in the trachea, but it is possible that the in ovo delivered CpG ODN-mediated CD8\u03b1+ T cell recruitment is tissue specific [22].
