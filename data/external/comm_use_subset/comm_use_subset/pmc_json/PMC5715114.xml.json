In the past few years, novel treatment options have been developed that prime the immune system for tumor cell eradication. Amongst these, the presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) has been shown to be a promising approach to induce potent and persisting antigen-specific T-cell responses. For this purpose, immunotherapies aim to break tolerance of the immune system against endogenous self- or to even target patient-specific mutant neo-antigens1. Cancer vaccines already licensed or currently in clinical trials comprise several different antigenic formats including vaccines targeting HPV antigens as the causative agent of cervical carcinoma2, dendritic cells loaded with antigens/peptides3, antigen-adjuvant conjugates (e.g. Sipuleucel-T/Provenge\u2122)4, or antigen-encoding modified RNAs5.",

Application of unmodified wild-type viruses has only rarely been successful, but was sometimes accompanied by significant disease caused by the infection. The advent of recombinant DNA technologies allowed rational development of viruses tailored for the specific lysis of tumor cells, so called oncolytic viruses (OVs). OVs have been derived from at least nine different virus families and have broadly entered early to advanced phase clinical trials6. While OVs have originally been developed for direct tumor cell lysis due to their inherent cytotoxicity, the potential contribution of the immune system to treatment efficacy seemed ambiguous. On the one hand, anti-viral immunity can inhibit oncolysis. On the other hand, at least some OVs trigger anti-tumoral immune responses, which has led to a change of the \u201concolytic dogma\u201d7. Local inflammation due to the release of pathogen- and danger-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively) during oncolysis transforms the originally immune-suppressive microenvironment into an immune-stimulatory one, triggering not only anti-viral, but also anti-tumoral immune responses, which may also act on distant tumor sites.",

Also GM-CSF encoding recombinant vaccine strain-derived measles viruses (MV) have been pre-clinically tested10,11, but only marker-gene encoding MVs are currently developed in several phase I and two phase II clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Nevertheless, the co-expression of immune-stimulants significantly enhanced the efficacy in mouse tumor models10,12. Although indicating the potential benefit of immune-stimulation, the (natural) selection of the tumor antigen(s), which the induced immunity is directed against, is presently not understood. This implies the risk of induction of autoimmune pathogenicity by selection of an antigen being also expressed on healthy tissue, especially, if combined with immuno-oncologic agents such as check-point inhibitors. To better focus induced anti-tumoral responses, other OVs, i.e. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or Maraba virus, have been equipped with expression cassettes encoding selected TAAs to direct immunity to those. However, these desired responses could only be induced by employing a heterologous prime-boost scheme using an adenoviral vector as prime, yet, since otherwise anti-OV immunity seemed too dominant13,14. In parallel, recombinant MV is developed as a vaccine platform by encoding foreign antigens in extra expression cassettes, so called additional transcription units (ATUs). MV expressing antigens of a range of different pathogens have been generated and have shown protection in pre-clinical models15,16 as well as safety and immunogenicity in a phase I clinical trial17.",

VLPs can incorporate and present selected antigens of choice on their surface. For example, hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg)-based VLPs presenting an immunogenic peptide of the TAA Claudin 18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2)34 or murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived VLPs presenting immunogenic peptides of the amyloid beta protein35 are able to effectively break immune tolerance against these auto-antigens.

For this purpose, Ova was genetically fused to the transmembrane domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR-TM) giving rise to a membrane-bound extracellular variant (DisOva) that should be readily incorporated into retroviral particles (Fig. 1b). A recombinant MV (MVvac2-gag-DisOva) encoding DisOva in an additional transcription unit (ATU) following the P gene in combination with a second, MLV Gag-encoding transgene cassette in front of the viral N gene, which give rise to in situ produced VLPs, was also generated (Fig. 1c,d). To analyze the immunogenicity of particle-associated antigen presentation by the resulting Ova-VLPs in comparison to exclusive surface antigen expression, a variant only carrying DisOva (MVvac2-DisOva) as well as a recombinant MV just encoding MLV-Gag (MVvac2-gag) for the release of bare VLPs have been generated (Fig. 1c).

Moreover, expression of mCLDN6 demonstrated by Western blot analysis of P10 virus was comparable to the expression in cells infected by P3 vaccines (Fig. 4a), and CLDN6-VLPs revealed considerable and specific staining for CLDN6, thereby demonstrating efficient incorporation and presentation of mCLDN6 by MLV-VLPs.

For MV-driven virotherapy, this has been largely hampered by the resistance of mice and most murine cells against MV infection already at the level of cell entry, since murine MV receptor homologues are not38,39 or less well40 recognized by the virus. Therefore, MV-based virotherapy has largely been analyzed in immunodeficient mice bearing human xenograft tumors. To analyze oncolytic MV in an immunocompetent mouse tumor model, entry restriction has been partially overcome by using re-targeted MV and target-transgenic murine tumor cell lines10,12. This system however not allowed the direct natural interaction41 of replicating MV with immune cells due to the lack of respective MV receptors on murine immune cells. In this study, we have developed for the first time a largely immunocompetent albeit somewhat impaired, MV-susceptible tumor-bearing mouse model that allows assessment of direct and indirect interaction of the replicating MV vector with most components of the immune system in vivo. This model may therefore be more predictive for immune-mediated effects although lacking the type-I IFN-driven immune-stimulatory program, which comprises a powerful stimulus for adaptive immunity during virus infection42. In human patients, these limitations are not as severe since MV is a primate virus and man is the natural host. Therefore, virus-host adaptation is granted, and tumor cells are known to often up-regulate the vaccine-strain receptor CD4643 to protect themselves from complement activity, since CD46 is the major complement regulating protein (MCP). Nevertheless, individual patients and their tumors will have to be stratified before treatment, since at least the oncolytic vaccine has to match the tumors\u2019 antigen profile, and susceptibility of primary tumor cells to measles virus infection is most likely quite advantageous to boost the lytic mode of action of such oncolytic vaccines. By additionally encoding a TAA to be presented either on the surface of infected cells or in situ produced VLPs, both cellular and strong humoral anti-TAA immune responses were induced using the MV-derived platform. Of note, humoral immunity became significant every time when the VLP-presenting vaccine has been used, an observation that may be defined more in detail by future experiments. This is even most remarkable, since the immune responses have been induced in a background lacking proper stimulation of adaptive responses by the type-I IFN pathway, which is likely to be also important for gaining full anti-tumor potency upon cancer vaccination44, especially since IgG-types with CDC effector function, in mice pre-dominantly IgG2a or IgG2b, became induced that are known to be typically associated with Th1-type responses. Therefore, our model may underestimate the potency of the vaccine component. Nevertheless, these tumor-specific responses substantially enhanced treatment efficacy against pre-established highly aggressive tumors and significantly inhibited metastasis formation.",

As an alternative to heterologous prime-boost, co-transfer of tumor antigen-specific T-cells45, or expression of cDNA libraries46 has revealed efficacy, but this is obviously not needed when applying the MV-based vectors, despite significant immune responses also against the MV platform.

Indeed, passive immunotherapy with anti-CLDN6 mAb (IMAB027) is currently under clinical development for patients with recurrent advanced ovarian cancer (NCT02054351). Such antibodies are effective by inducing responses such as CDC and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against opsonized tumor cells34,48. Here, we observed efficient killing of target-positive cells by CDC using the vaccine-induced antibodies of mouse sera that were most robustly induced when using VLP-encoding vaccines. The advantages of using an oncolytic vaccine to induce humoral anti-tumoral immunity compared to the application of respective mAbs may be two-fold: Firstly, oncolytic vaccines possess an additional mode of action by directly lysing tumor cells during virus replication. Secondly, the oncolytic vaccine induces polyclonal antibodies, thereby impairing resistance development of tumor cells harboring mutations of the single epitope targeted by a given mAb.",

Interestingly, the experiments using the vaccines encoding the DisOva model antigen may indicate some mechanistic background: Only for the VLP-encoding vaccine, induction of CD4+ T helper cells became significant. This T-cell help is required for efficient induction of humoral immune responses and may thus explain the high capacity of MVvac2-gag-CLDN6 to induce humoral responses. Of note, the additional expression of the TAA turned out to be sufficient to induce potent anti-tumoral immune responses, different to previously studied alternative oncolytic vaccine platforms, which needed an heterologous prime for induction of anti-tumoral responses13,14. Interestingly, antibody effector function as well as protection in the prophylactic setting became only significant using VLP-presented antigen, a quality that might be related to inducing a Th1-bias facilitating antibody class switch. Anyway, our data provide evidence that such targeted immune induction is more effective than virus replication alone, already acting by releasing stimulatory danger- and pathogen-associated motif patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively) during tumor cell lysis49,50. Moreover, oncolytic viruses are known to additionally stimulate anti-tumoral immunity by direct or indirect interaction via infected tumor cells with immune cells51. This holds especially true for MV, which naturally is a lymphotropic virus, and also vaccine strain viruses reveal a strong preference for dendritic cells and macrophages in vivo\n52,53. Moreover, the stimulatory action of such infection has already been shown49. These properties of the viruses allow the tumor vaccine activity also in the prophylactic setting in mice without tumors.",

The MV vaccine strain used is tested pre-clinically and clinically as platform for the generation of vaccines against at least 17 different pathogens, while the oncolytic efficacy is analysed in at least 7 clinical phase I or II trials. The recombinant vaccines provide powerful and protective immune responses in appropriate animal models and clinical testing. In this study, first evidence is provided that the MV platform combining both the oncolytic and tumor vaccination approach is even strong enough to break tolerance against endogenous tumor antigens and can thus be used to generate potent tumor vaccines. The potent and highly specific anti-tumoral immune responses significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in a novel, meaningful in vivo model for solid tumor growth and metastasis formation using a clinically relevant tumor antigen. Thus, oncolytic MV presenting selected TAAs may improve virotherapy efficacy by increasing the immunotherapeutic aspect of this approach.",

To obtain membrane-associated Ovalbumin, ova was amplified by PCR without STOP, flanked with BglII/SacII sites, and sequenced after cloning into pCR2.1-TOPO to yield pCR2.1-OvaBgl/Sac. The ova fragment was introduced via BglII/SacII into pDis-mod encoding for PDGFR-TM. pDis-mod is a modification of pDisplay (Invitrogen), with MluI and AatII sites 5\u2032 of the SP and 3\u2032 of the PDGFR-TM-sequence, respectively. mCLDN6 or DisOva were inserted into p(+)MVvac2-ATU(P)61 via AatII/MluI to yield p(+)MVvac2-mCLDN6(P) or p(+)MVvac2-DisOva(P), respectively. A CMV promoter cassette62 was inserted via NotI/SbfI to generate p(+)PolII-MVvac2-mCLDN6(P) or p(+)PolII-MVvac2-DisOva(P).

The fragment with CMV promoter and gag gene cassettes were transferred via NotI/SbfI into p(+)MVvac2-mCLDN6(P) or p(+)MVvac2-pDisOva(P) to obtain p(+)PolII-MVvac2-MLVgag(N)-mCLDN6(P) or p(+)PolII-MVvac2-MLVgag(N)-DisOva(P), respectively.
