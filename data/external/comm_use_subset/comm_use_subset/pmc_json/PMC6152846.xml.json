As with many novel concepts, this \u201cradical\u201d method of vaccination met with skepticism and doubt. Jenner self-published his use of variolation to protect against smallpox because the Royal Society considered that they might damage the Society's reputation by publishing his findings in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.1 So too, the idea of using DNA as a vaccine was first considered questionable. However, convincing experimental evidence from our laboratory and others over the past 25 years has demonstrated the powerful potential of this method for immunization and contributed to the use of in vivo expression of DNA-encoded proteins for gene therapy, cancer immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibody production.2\u20134",

In experiments conducted in collaboration with Rob Webster of St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital (which had the appropriate BSL3 laboratory for testing avian influenza virus infections in chickens), the retroviral vector\u2013based vaccine completely protected chickens against a lethal influenza virus challenge.7 In contrast, birds within the control group succumbed to influenza. Given this, we next tested an infectious, replication-defective pseudotype of the retroviral vector for the ability to provide protection. This replication-defective pseudotype, despite inoculating <1 \u00d7 106 infectious units, also achieved 100% protection, demonstrating that even low titers of a replication-defective vector could achieve protective immunity.",

Given the ability of relatively few infectious units of the infectious, replication defective pseudotype to achieve protection and a growing body of evidence for successful in vivo transfection,8,9 we tested the ability of the DNA forms of both the replication-competent and replication-defective vectors to achieve protection. We made as much DNA as we could and asked Rob to vaccinate chickens with 300 \u03bcg of vaccine DNA or empty vector DNA (the control). Each chicken received 300 \u03bcg of DNA at weeks 0 and 4 delivered by three routes (subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intravenous). A lethal influenza virus challenge was administered at week 5. We learned that our first DNA experiment had worked when Rob left the message \u201cSend more vaccine.\u201d We had achieved 100% protection in both groups of chickens, receiving either the replication-competent or the replication-defective vectors. We immediately set out to repeat the trial, telling nobody of the result until a patent had been filed. Once we had filed, we began to present the results, but these were met with disdain and skepticism. The first question at the summer 1992 American Society of Virology meeting was \u201cYou don't think this will ever be useful, do you?\u201d Our grants were triaged and our manuscripts returned (despite Nature sending the report to multiple reviewers). Fortunately, our department chair, Guido Majno, a pathologist with broad interests in the history of science and medicine and author of the bestselling book, The Healing Hand, recognized the potential of what we were doing and provided departmental funds to keep us going. We knew we were onto something, and we kept going.",

In earlier biolistic studies, Stephen Johnston had used a gene gun to deliver human growth hormone to the outer ears of mice and realized that he had not affected mouse growth but had elicited Ab to human growth hormone.13 The use of the Agracetus gun (the size of a refrigerator) generated a great deal of excitement (and noise) within the department, but did not allay suspicions about our laboratory's endeavors.",

Part of this is due to DNA vaccines having been used for the development of vaccines for chronic infections, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which are difficult targets for vaccination.

Protein boosts are most effective for the epitopes that are common to the DNA-expressed antigen and the boost. In this case, the DNA-expressed antigen can serve to focus the boost on epitopes that represent the native antigen.

            "text": "Heterologous prime boosts can be highly effective for eliciting high levels of CD8+ T cells26,27 and antibody.28,29 They are, however, cumbersome for the development of real-world vaccines because they require two different products that need to be used in the correct order. Thus, they can be expensive to manufacture and deliver. Recently, however, successful vaccination, including the generation of neutralizing Ab, has been achieved in nonhuman primates with a DNA vaccine for Zika virus using only two intramuscular bioject deliveries of the vaccine preparation.30 Following challenge, 95% (17/18) of the animals had no detectable viremia. Currently, this Zika virus DNA vaccine candidate is in Phase I clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02840487). This success reflects the high immunogenicity of the Zika glycoprotein, and sets a precedent for DNA immunizations with other highly immunogenic proteins holding good promise for success. Following electroporation, Ebola, Marburg, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) vaccines have shown promise in nonhuman primates,31,32 and the MERS vaccine has been advanced to clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02670187).",
