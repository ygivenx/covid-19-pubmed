            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. They are globally important infectious agents that are associated with respiratory, digestive, and neurological diseases in humans and animals [1]. The Coronaviridae family consists of four genera known as the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and Deltacoronaviruses [1,2]. These viruses use a variety of cellular receptors and co-receptors, including proteins and sugars. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the Betacoronavirus genus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor, and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) is located within CTD of the S1 domain [3]. ACE2 is also a receptor for human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), in which three discontinuous fragments located within CTD of the S1 domain are responsible for receptor binding [4]. No structural homology has been found between the SARS and HCoV-NL63 RBDs, but they recognize the same receptor (ACE2). Meanwhile, their RBDs share the same receptor recognition hotspots [5]. The RBD of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is located within CTD of the S1 domain. The RBD crystal structures of TGEV and HCoV-NL63 show similarities, but they use different receptors [2]. The RBDs of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in the same genus of Betacoronaviruses are located in the N-terminus of the S1 domain. However, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) and sugar serve as the receptors for MHV and BCoV, respectively, despite their high sequence homology [6,7].",

Its clinical symptoms include watery diarrhea, severe enteritis, vomiting, and weight loss; the mortality rate can reach 50%\u201390% in suckling piglets [8,9,10]. In 1977, Pensaert isolated a new coronavirus-like particle associated with diarrhea from Belgian swine breeding farms. This virus was different from TGEV and was designated CV777 [11]. Subsequently, the disease was reported in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, Switzerland, Hungary, and Italy. Since 2010, massive PED outbreaks have been reported in Asia. In April 2013, there was a sudden occurrence of PED disease that rapidly spread across the United States, causing high rates of death among piglets [8]. Currently, PED is considered a pandemic disease that causes substantial economic losses to pork producers all over the world.",

The PEDV S protein is a homotrimeric membrane glycoprotein that contains a signal peptide (residues 1\u201320); an S1 region (residues 21\u2013793) that mediates the attachment of virus particles to the cell surface receptor; an S2 region (residues 794\u20131385) that mediates virus fusion to host cells; a transmembrane domain (residues 1335\u20131358) and a cytoplasmic tail (residues 1359\u20131385); the S1 region contains two subdomains, an NTD (residues 21\u2013324) and a CTD (residues 253\u2013638) [14,15] (Figure 1A). Previous studies have confirmed that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) acts as a receptor for PEDV entry into target cells [16,17,18]. All characterized coronavirus S1 domain contain an RBD that is responsible for interactions with the cellular receptors for viral attachment. Lee determined that the N-terminus of the PEDV S1 domain was necessary for receptor binding using a co-immunoprecipitation assay; the minimal binding region was confirmed to be located within residues 25\u201388 [14]. To date, there are no conclusive data concerning the exact location of the PEDV RBD and the key amino acids that participate in receptor binding.",

To compare the receptor-binding activity between the variant field isolate and the prototype strain, a plasmid expressing residues 249\u2013634 of the S1 domain from the CV777 strain was constructed with a C-terminal IgG4 Fc tag. The protein was expressed in insect cells and purified with a Protein G column; a highly purified protein was obtained (Figure 3B). Then, the receptor-binding activities of the CHGD-01 S253\u2013638 fragment and the CV777 S249\u2013634 fragment were investigated using a flow cytometry assay, different concentrations of the CHGD-01 S253\u2013638 or the CV777 S249\u2013634 protein including 12.5, 25, and 50 \u03bcg/mL were used for detection. pAPN-transfected cells untreated with protein or treated with IgG4 Fc protein were used as controls.

The PEDV S1 C-terminus was predicted to contain eight \u03b2-strands and several loops (Figure 4A, left). Importantly, three loops were located at the tips of the \u03b2-barrel domains in the predicted structure; these loops also occur in the structure of TGEV RBD (Figure 4A, middle) and the HCoV-NL63 RBD (Figure 4A, right). Then, the correspondence sequences of PEDV, TGEV, and HCoV-NL63 were aligned using ClustalW. The results showed that the three loops responsible for receptor binding at the tips of the \u03b2-barrel domains of PEDV, TGEV, and HCoV-NL63 were located at the same site (Figure 4B). Since PEDV, TGEV, PRCV, and HCoV-NL63 all belong to Alphacoronavirus, our results confirmed that the RBD of PEDV was located in the CTD. Based on the above results, we infer that the three loops at the tips of the \u03b2-barrel domains may also be responsible for PEDV receptor binding.",

The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV RBD and ACE2 complex revealed a continuous receptor-binding motif located at residues 424\u2013494 of the S1 domain [26]. In contrast, the CTD of HCoV-NL63 S1 is composed of a \u03b2-sandwich structure that contains three discontinuous receptor-binding motifs responsible for ACE2 binding [4]. The crystal structures of the PRCV and TGEV RBDs show a single domain unit that adopts a \u03b2-barrel fold with two highly twisted \u03b2-sheets located in the CTD of the S1 domain and participates in pAPN binding [2]. The NTD of the MHV S1 domain is a RBD for the CEACAM interaction, and the crystal structure of the MHV NTD shows a galectin-like fold with four discontinuous receptor-binding motifs [7]. The homologous BCoV NTD also possesses a galectin fold but uses Neu5,9Ac2 as its receptor [6]. Several studies have identified pAPN as a functional receptor for PEDV virus entry [16,17], but the exact location of the RBD and the function of the NTD and CTD of the S1 domain in receptor recognition have not yet been determined.",

The RBDs from these viruses are all located near the C-terminal region of the S1 domain [29,30]. Our results are in agreement with previous studies. Hence, we can conclude that the pAPN-binding domain of the PEDV S1 domain is located within its CTD. In Figure 2D,E, the results of the S19\u2013638 and S477\u2013629 fragments were not consistent. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear but may be related to the different exposing level of protein surface in ELISA and FACS.",

Single amino acid mutations in the three loops completely or significantly reduce PRCV RBD binding to pAPN, and the mutations outside the RBD have no effect on receptor recognition [2]. The crystal structure of the HCoV-NL63 RBD-ACE2 complex shows three protruding \u03b2-loops surrounding a shallow bowl-shaped cavity at the top of the RBD that are important for receptor binding. RBM3 (residues 585\u2013590) is more compact than either RBM1 (residues 493\u2013513) or RBM2 (residues 531\u2013541) [4]. Only one amino acid mutation completely or greatly reduced the ACE2 binding activity of HCoV-NL63 [31]. In our study, the RBM1-1, RBM2-1, and RBM3-2 proteins did not significantly lose their pAPN-binding activities, indicating that the PEDV S protein uses a different receptor-binding model than TGEV, PRCV, and HCoV-NL63, which was further confirmed by PEDV displaying a broader receptor binding region than other Alphacoronaviruses in our study.",

A sugar moiety on cell-surface glycoproteins or glycolipids (i.e., Neu5,9Ac2) can be recognized by BCoV and HCoV-OC43 in the genus Betacoronavirus [6,32]. Moreover, two other types of sugars (Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac) can serve as receptors or co-receptors for some \u03b1- and Gammacoronaviruses, such as TGEV and IBV [9,33,34]. The NTD of the TGEV S1 domain is responsible for its enteric tropism, and the related PRCV, which lacks this domain, does not show enteric tropism [35]. Thus, binding sugar as a co-receptor is linked with the enteric tropism of coronaviruses [36]. In the present study, a flow cytometry assay found that the S1\u2013434 and S253\u2013533 fragments could weakly bind to pAPN-expressing cells, and that the S19\u2013638 fragment revealed a much higher binding affinity, which indicates that except for pAPN recognized by the CTD of the PEDV S1 domain, other cellular molecules, such as sugars, can be recognized by the NTD of the S1 domain as receptors or co-receptors. Similar to TGEV, which uses Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac as co-receptors [33,36,37], we confirmed that the NTD of the PEDV S1 domain can also interact with sugar. Thus, sugar may act as a co-receptor for PEDV.",

Sequence analysis of PEDV prototype and variant strains revealed more than 100 amino acid mutations within the S protein, especially in the N-terminus, but very few changes are found within the C-terminus [20,21]. When comparing the RBD sequences between the CHGD-01 and the CV777 strains, only several amino acid mutations were found, so it is reasonable that the pAPN-binding activities of the CHGD-01 and CV777 RBDs are similar. When the sugar-binding activity was compared between the CHGD-01 and the CV777 strains, the CHGD-01 strain showed stronger binding efficiency. This finding is not unreasonable due to the obvious difference in the N-terminal S1 gene sequences between the two strains. Most likely, the mutated amino acids participate in sugar binding. Furthermore, among the many factors that contribute to the infectivity and pathogenicity of PEDV, the enhanced receptor binding activity of the variant strain may play important roles. Prior to 2010, PEDV infection was relatively mild, with sporadic PED outbreaks; however, since late 2010, PED outbreaks have occurred in many countries in Asia and North America [13,38]. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether the enhanced receptor binding activity of the new variant strain is responsible for the recent PED outbreaks.",

Before visualization, the blots were incubated with mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody; (E) A pull-down assay was performed to assess the pAPN-binding activities of the CHGD-01 S477\u2013629, RBM1-1, RBM2-1, and RBM3-2. pAPN was mixed with the CHGD-01 S477\u2013629, RBM1-1, RBM2-1, and RBM3-2 proteins. The formed complexes were precipitated using Ni Sepharose\u2122 6 Fast Flow. After washing with RIPA lysis buffer, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected using anti-His antibodies and anti-human IgG4 Fc antibodies, respectively. The top panel shows the input pAPN protein and the bottom panel shows the precipitated CHGD-01 S477\u2013629, RBM1-1, RBM2-1, and RBM3-2 proteins.",

Wells without S fragment protein were used as controls. ELISA plates were coated with the S1\u2013793, S1\u2013543, S1\u2013434, S1\u2013324, S253\u2013631, and S477\u2013629 proteins and blocked with BSA. The plates were then incubated with the pAPN protein. The TMB substrate was added after incubation with mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody.
