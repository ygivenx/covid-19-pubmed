Reports in the Philosophical Transactions played a leading role in establishing the efficacy and relative safety of inoculation against smallpox.",

He became personal physician to the families of three British monarchs, Queen Anne, George I and George II, a man of public affairs and a philanthropist. Born into an Irish Protestant family in the year that the Royal Society was founded, Sloane studied medicine and took a great interest in natural history, being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society at the age of 25. Although he had already established a medical practice in London, he leapt at the opportunity to accompany the Duke of Albemarle as family physician when Albemarle was appointed Governor of Jamaica in 1687. Sloane collected numerous botanical specimens and kept a detailed account of his observations on the natural history and people of the Caribbean islands during his 15 months' sojourn there, which he later published in two volumes of exemplary natural history. He disliked the bitter cocoa beans of the New World and advocated the use of a concoction of cocoa, sugar and milk, which we know as chocolate, mostly as a medicinal beverage. In 1719, he became President of the Royal Society of Physicians London. He was also appointed physician-general to the army in 1722. He served as Secretary to the Royal Society (1693\u20131713) when he had editorial responsibility for Philosophical Transactions [3], and in 1727, he succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as President of the Society, stepping down from that post 13 years later at the age of 80.\n",

He left his personal collections to the Crown on the provision that they would be well housed and curated for the benefit of the public, and that his daughters would receive a stipend. Parliament eventually approved this bequest and Sloane's collections became the basis of the British Museum in Bloomsbury and its offshoot, the Natural History Museum in South Kensington. He donated the land on which the Physick Garden stands in Chelsea to the Apothecaries' Society, which still exists as an eighteenth century medical herbarium. The influence of Sir Hans Sloane on this area of London, where he bought the manor of Chelsea, lasts to this day in place names such as Sloane Square and Hans Crescent. As a benefactor, Sloane was a founding supporter of the Foundling Hospital for Children in Bloomsbury, which was established by three notable friends, the merchant seaman Thomas Coram, the composer George Frideric Handel and the artist William Hogarth.",

His paper on smallpox describes how he became acquainted in 1721 with the benefits of intradermal inoculation of a small dose of smallpox-infected fluid from a vesicle, and became an advocate of the procedure among the royal family and the medical profession. This paper is just what its title suggests: it is an account or reminiscence of Sloane's introduction of the practice of inoculation and does not really represent a remarkable discovery. Nonetheless, it is full of insights into the disease and an important means to prevention.",

In fact, it was not published until 1755, just over a year after Sloane's death. Why Sloane provided this account at this time to John Ranby FRS remains obscure as Ranby was not involved in editing Philosophical Transactions. By 1755 his \u2018co-author\u2019 (the person who communicated the paper to the Royal Society), the Reverend Dr Thomas Birch, was the Secretary of the Society with responsibility for Philosophical Transactions. Birch would have had access to Sloane's papers as he was a founding trustee of the British Museum where the papers were (and are) stored. Sloane's collections of books, antiquities, natural curiosities and manuscripts formed the museum's original collection, including material on Sloane's activities as Secretary and later President of the Royal Society. The reason for the long delay in publication is not clear, but it seems possible that when Birch was sorting through Sloane's papers, he came across this piece and thought that it should finally see light of day.",

The first was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689\u20131762) (figure 2) who first observed variolation in Turkey and who had her son inoculated there in 1717 and her daughter in England during the 1721 epidemic (box 1). The second was Princess Caroline (1683\u20131737), wife of the future George II, who sought Sloane's advice on whether her own children should be inoculated. Sloane relates that her decision to take this risk followed two successful trials of variolation: the first was on adults in Newgate prison under death sentence who \u2018volunteered\u2019 to be variolated in exchange for their release if they survived, one of whom was sent to have contact with a smallpox patient as a test of protection; the second was on \u2018charity children\u2019, orphans in the parish of St James in London. The ethics of enrolment into clinical trials may have changed since those days but the concept of step by step inquiry from safety to efficacy remains unchanged.\n",

This was a very diplomatic reply so that the Princess had to make the decision herself. She then urged Sloane to speak to the children's grandfather, George I, who condoned it (even though he was barely on speaking terms with the children's father, the Prince of Wales). Inoculating the royal children without ill effect helped to make variolation widely acceptable among the English aristocracy and gentry. The procedure was also introduced in New England [5] (see box 5). In France, however, it was thought to be reckless [6] and Voltaire commented on the difference in attitudes between the two nations with characteristic acuity (box 2).",

Like many epidemic infectious diseases, the causative agent, variola virus (figure 3b), probably crossed over from an animal source after humans attained sufficient population density to sustain the propagation and diversification of the variola virus independently from its original host. It was not until the 1890s that filterable viruses were first distinguished from bacteria that were retained by porous filters. Orthopox viruses, to which variola and vaccinia belong, were first identified as filterable agents by Adelchi Negri's study of vaccinia in 1906 [11]. The story of the rise and fall of smallpox is told by Frank Fenner and the pioneers of eradication [11] as well as several more recent popular books [12\u201315].\n",

Many of those who survived showed permanent signs of past infection, such as blindness and pock marks on the skin, but they acquired long-term immunity that rendered them resistant to re-infection. The lack of an animal reservoir, combined with the appearance of obvious signs of infection in all cases, and lack of virus persistence in recovered individuals, permitted the containment and eventual eradication of smallpox as a naturally occurring disease.",

There are no records of a smallpox-like disease in the Bible or Greco-Roman writings [16]. The first reliable description of smallpox was made in China and dates from the fifth century of the Christian Era (CE) although it may have been present in Asia earlier. The first recorded description of smallpox in Western Europe was made in 581 by the Bishop Gregory of Tours. The Persian physician Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyya Al-Razi (854\u2013925 CE) [18] wrote a monograph on smallpox and measles (Kitab al-Jadari wa'l-hasba) which is the oldest medical treatise on these two diseases as distinct ailments (interestingly, he considered measles to be the more virulent infection). Al-Razi advocated a way to prevent smallpox affecting the cornea and thereby causing blindness [18]. He wrote: \u2018As soon as the symptoms of smallpox appear, drop rose water into the eyes from time to time, for if the disease be favourable and the pustules few in number, you find that this method of treatment prevents their breaking out in the eyes' (p. 148).",

Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA genome of the virus reveals a close similarity to camelpox virus [19] but also to a poxvirus isolated from the West African rodent, the Tatera gerbil [16,20]. Using forensic DNA and phylogenetic methods, it is often possible to ascertain which host was the original reservoir by determining whether the genetic variability of one species' microbe is nested within a broader diversity of the other's. Thus, it is clear that the pandemic strain of HIV-1 came from chimpanzees in Cameroon [21], whereas for the tubercle bacillus, human Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be ancestral to animal strains such as Mycobacterium bovis [22]. While the ancestral orthopox virus for Variola appears to reside in burrowing rodents, insufficient samples of pox virus isolates have been analysed to discern whether both smallpox and camelpox were independently derived from the rodentpox virus, or smallpox from camelpox, or camelpox from smallpox. If camelpox was the immediate precursor to smallpox, this situation has parallels to the current outbreak in humans of the coronavirus causing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Serological and genome studies indicate that a virus closely related to MERS is widespread among domestic dromedaries; fortunately, human cases thus far represent either a primary zoonosis or nosocomial infections directly related to the zoonosis [23].",

It is curious that no further field investigations of rodent variola-like viruses have been made since the African gerbil virus was isolated 40 years ago. We therefore propose that it would be informative to characterize pox viruses of gerbil and marmot species indigenous to Mongolia, the Gobi desert and the central Asian steppe. These are the same species, incidentally, that gave rise to the Black Death clades of the plague bacillus Yersinia pestis in the fourteenth century; indeed, Variola major may have migrated westwards along the same silk route 1000 years earlier. We further propose that several independent cross-species introductions of smallpox may have occurred, as seen for HIV in the twentieth century [21]. Thus, the two major clades of Variola minor [16,20] may have separate African origins, and Variola major an Asian one.",

Smallpox emerged as a major scourge of humankind, spreading all over the inhabited world. As late as 1967, when the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Campaign, the annual number of smallpox cases was estimated to be between 10 and 16 million, with 2.6 million deaths across 31 countries [11]. During the past 500 years, the impact of smallpox was particularly severe when it reached naive populations. For instance, pre-Columbian New World peoples had never experienced smallpox because their ancestors crossed the Bering Strait before it emerged in humans. The high mortality observed in the first American epidemics, authentic examples of \u2018virgin soil epidemics\u2019, could have been exacerbated by the genetic constitution of the affected population which limited their capacity to establish appropriate immunological responses to the newly introduced pathogens [25]. Hernan Cortes and his band of adventurers would not have succeeded in overcoming the mighty Aztec Empire in 1521 without the epidemic of smallpox which they unwittingly released into the capital city, Tenochtitlan, the previous year, as told in the chronicles of the conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo [26]. Without the devastating effect of smallpox [27] and other viral diseases such as measles, there would not have been an estimated 85\u201390% fall in the population of indigenous Americans during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries [28], and therefore little impetus to establish the trans-Atlantic slave trade [9].",

Therefore, it was recommended that inoculated individuals should undergo a preparation procedure and be isolated during the vesicular period to avoid starting an outbreak among contacts. Later, vaccination removed these risks, but variolation was preferable to catching natural smallpox, with its much higher mortality and survivors often left pock-marked or blind.

In that meeting, and to honour Jenner, Pasteur proposed to generalize the term \u2018vaccination\u2019 to all protective immunization procedures. In 1885, almost 90 years after the development of vaccination against smallpox, Louis Pasteur and \u00c9mile Roux described the second human vaccine, against rabies, although this was an inactivated vaccine rather than an attenuated one [49].",

But we recognize that the full impact of vaccination has not been achieved, and major efforts are being made to develop vaccines against other diseases [55,56]. Equally important is the ongoing effort to make those vaccines available to all people of need around the world [54].

Every medical intervention implies the need for a risk\u2013benefit assessment and the prevention of smallpox provides a good example. Although vilified by some, variolation could be justified on the terms of a more damaging alternative, namely to suffer the disease. Despite the inherent value of variolation, modern vaccinologists often consider variolation only as a procedure that facilitated the introduction of vaccination. However, variolation and vaccination coexisted in the UK until at least 1840, when variolation was outlawed by the Vaccination Act of that year. More controversial at that time was the Vaccination Act of 1853 that instituted compulsory vaccination. That decision led to movements that opposed vaccination, which on several occasions resulted in violent demonstrations [62]. Alfred Russel Wallace, who postulated evolution by natural selection independently of Charles Darwin, was deeply opposed to compulsory vaccination [63]. Eventually, in 1898, a new UK law was passed which permitted conscientious objectors [64].",

The 0.3% mortality from variolation in Sloane's time was considered to be worth the risk, and the seriously adverse side effects of modern vaccines are far fewer; yet we recently witnessed how the entirely spurious scare of autism resulting from measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) combined vaccine led so many parents to avoid protecting their children.
