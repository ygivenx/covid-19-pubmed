            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is one of the most important causative agents of enteric infections in pigs. The infection is associated with high morbidity in animals of all ages and with high mortality rates (up to 100%) in seronegative suckling piglets [1]-[3]. TGEV is an enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome approximately 28.5-kb in size, and it consists of four structural proteins: the spike (S), the integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [1], [4], [5]. About two-thirds of the entire RNA from the 5\u2032 end comprise open reading frames 1a and 1ab, which encode a number of nonstructural proteins including the replicase. The 3\u2032 third of the genome contains the genes encoding the structural and some nonstructural proteins (5\u2032-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032) [6]. The glycoprotein S is primarily responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies and for initiating infection [7]-[9]. The appearance of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), a respiratory mutant of TGEV has drastically decreased the risk of TGE in Europe, since neutralizing antibodies elicited by the avirulent PRCoV can provide cross-protection against TGEV infection [10]. In contrast, TGE prevalence is still reported and some TGEVs have been isolated in different parts of the world, e.g. in various geographical locations in China, implying that TGEV infection is still threatening pig industry [11]\u2013[14].",

However, current traditional inactivated and attenuated vaccines are less effective than desired due to failure of vaccination to prevent viral shedding or reversion of the attenuated to a virulent phenotype. The lack of therapeutical treatment of TGE underlines the importance of development of effective antivirals Lithium salts have been used to treat diseases such as 'gout and rheumatic gout', 'Bright's disease', epilepsy, syphilis, acute mania and depressive episodes [15]. There are several reports regarding the inhibitory effect of lithium salts on the replication of several DNA viruses, such as type 1 and 2 herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus [15], [16]. More recently, we and another research group demonstrated that lithium chloride (LiCl) inhibits infection of cell cultures by infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), an avian coronavirus [17], [18].",

The effect of LiCl on TGEV infection was analyzed by plaque assays, RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. The effect of the drug on infection cycle of TGEV and virus production was assessed by time-dependent drug addition. The inhibition of LiCl to cell apoptosis caused by TGEV was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The protective effect of LiCl to other RNA viruses was also compared. Our data demonstrate that LiCl may be a potent antiviral agent via an anti-apoptotic mechanism.",

There are very limited reports concerning anti-TGEV drugs and lack of effective therapeutical treatment highlights the importance of identifying appropriate antivirals. Recently, Yang et al.

The authors found a series of benzothiazolium compounds that had inhibitory activity against TGEV 3CLpro, one of the main proteases for the replicase polyproteins in coronaviruses and these drugs exerted anti-TGEV activities in terms of viral protein synthesis and RNA replication in TGEV-infected ST cells [25].

            "text": "To see whether coronaviruses from different species have a general susceptibility to LiCl treatment, we performed an evaluation of the antiviral effect of LiCl on TGEV, a porcine coronavirus. First, we used two approaches to analyze TGEV infection in two cell lines (porcine kidney cell line, PK-15 and swine testis cell line, ST). The inhibitory effect of LiCl was evident both when the virus was titrated by plaque assay and when the viability of the cells was determined by the MTT assay quantifying mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities. In addition to TGEV strain PUR46-MAD, a virulent TGEV isolate HBY was tested for its sensitivity to LiCl and was found also to be affected by this inhibitor (data not shown). At the same time, infection of different cell lines by PEDV, another porcine coronavirus and bovine rotavirus (PRV), a double-stranded RNA virus, were inhibited by LiCl effectively. These data show that inhibition by LiCl may be a general feature of some virus families, e.g. coronaviruses. In addition, we found that LiCl did not directly interact with or inactivate TGEV particles and was ineffective when pre-incubated with host cells. In contrast, it inhibited plaque formation of virus-infected cells. The results are consistent with the inhibitory effect of LiCl on IBV. We therefore confirm our hypothesis that the sensitivity of coronavirus to LiCl is a general feature of this virus family.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that LiCl may act as an inhibitor of the DNA virus herpes simplex virus [15]. Viral proteases play key roles in virus replication and have been identified as potential targets in the search for antiviral agents, e.g. for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus infections [25]\u2013[28]. In our study, the conventional RT-PCR targeting the 3CLpro and a 5\u2032 leader sequence of 3a gene in conjunction with the partial TGEV S gene indicated that the effect of LiCl could be on RNA transcription and replication. For IBV and TGEV coronaviruses, it is also possible that LiCl inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are characteristic of positive and negative-stranded RNA viruses [17]. To further address the action of LiCl on TGEV replication, the plaque formation and virus production were quantified using time-of-addition assays during the infection cycle of TGEV. Our results showed that LiCl inhibited TGEV infection effectively when added as late as 12 h after the virus inoculation, indicating that the inhibition of LiCl occurred during the whole viral replication after infection. In our study, we used different TGEV titers for cell infection and the inhibition of TGEV by LiCl in vitro was titer-independent, which implies that the drug also inhibits virus spread from cell to cell. The impact of LiCl on TGEV load evaluated by real-time PCR further confirmed its inhibition activity against TGEV.",

            "text": "Recently, the antiviral activity of quercetin 7-rhamnoside against PEDV, another porcine coronavirus, has been analyzed. Interestingly, the effectiveness of Q7R against TGEV and PRCV (a respiratory variant of TGEV) was lower when compared to PEDV [29]. This finding might suggest that some coronaviruses differ in their susceptibility to the same drug. In our study, we show that coronaviruses TGEV and PEDV are equally sensitive to LiCl treatment; BRV, another RNA virus, showed a similar sensitivity to the inhibitor. Our findings suggest a consistent sensitivity of coronaviruses and some other RNA viruses to LiCl. TGEV is the first coronavirus documented to trigger apoptosis in infected cells [30]. Subsequently, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [31], murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [32], severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [33], and equine coronavirus [34] were found to have similar apoptotic effects. In our study, we confirmed that TGEV infection induced the appearance of apoptotic cells as shown by immmunofluorescence analysis. The flow cytometry results showed that most apoptotic cells were at a stage of late apoptosis at 40 h post-infection; however, both early and late apoptosis of TGEV-infected cells was inhibited by LiCl efficiently. Caspase-3, a member of the aspartate-specific cysteinyl proteases or caspases has been identified as being a key mediator of apoptosis of mammalian cells [35]. In this study, the expression of caspase-3 was inhibited after addition of LiCl to TGEV-infected cells. PDTC, a known caspase inhibitor, was able to inhibit TGEV induced apoptosis [30]. Interestingly, we found that LiCl also had a potent inhibitory effect on TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. Apoptosis-associated caspase activation of TGEV and SARS-CoV has been reported [30], [33]. We therefore anticipate that LiCl may have protective effects on SARS-CoV induced infection and apoptosis. Taken together, the data indicate that LiCl may inhibit TGEV infection via exerting an anti-apoptotic effect mediated by caspase 3-related pathways.",
