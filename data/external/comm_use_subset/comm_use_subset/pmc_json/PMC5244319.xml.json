The left-end hairpin contains a bubble region and an asymmetric T, while the right end harbors a stem-loop structure (21). mRNA transcripts are generated from alternatively processed mRNA precursor transcribed from the promoter located at map unit 5 (P5). The left half of the HBoV genome encodes the nonstructural protein NS1, which is essential for viral replication. Like other parvoviruses, HBoV NS1 contains DNA-binding and endonuclease domains in the N terminus, ATPase and helicase domains in the center, and a transactivation domain at the C terminus (23). The nonstructural protein NP1 open reading frame (ORF) is located in the middle of the viral genome. NP1 is required for the efficient replication of viral DNA, facilitates VP-encoding mRNA transcripts to read through the internal polyadenylation site, and plays a role in controlling the production of VP mRNAs (21, 24, 25). The right half of the genome encodes the structural proteins VP1 and VP2, which share a C terminus, while the N terminus of VP1 contains a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) domain which is essential for parvovirus infectivity (26, 27).",

Blockage to the production of full-length capsid-encoding transcripts by (pA)p in the middle of the viral genome could be a limiting step for parvovirus infection (29, 30). All of the bocaviruses contain a similar stem-loop structure at the right end. The distal polyadenylation sites, (pA)d, of BPV and MVC are located on the right-end palindromic terminus (31, 32), and the capsid mRNA transcripts of BPV and MVC are polyadenylated in the loop of stem-loop structures (32). However, the distal polyadenylation site of HBoV is located about 400 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the right-end hairpin and is polyadenylated downstream of the hexanucleotide AAUAAA. The differences among the (pA)d sites in BPV, MVC, and HBoV raise the question of how HBoV polyadenylation at (pA)d is regulated.",

Interestingly, the last 42 nt of the right-end stem of HBoV and MVC are almost identical, with only two different nucleotides in the loop (Fig. 2A). To confirm our 3\u2032 RACE results, total RNA of pHBoV1-WH-transfected HEK293T cells were harvested at different times (12, 24, 36, and 48 h) and hybridized with oligo(dT) and specific primers upstream of (pA)d. RNA fragments were detected with probes spanning from nt 4745 to nt 5171 after RNase H cleavage. Polyadenylation at (pA)d and (pA)d2 were both detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2D), which is consistent with 3\u2032 RACE data and suggests that a portion of VP1/VP2 encoding mRNA transcripts are polyadenylated at (pA)d2.",

Transfection of the NS1 knockout plasmid (pHBoV1-NS1KO) resulted in a 7-fold reduction in polyadenylation at (pA)d2 (Fig. 3B, lane 3, and C, lane 2). Cotransfection of pHBoV1-NS1KO and NS1 expression plasmid (pcDNA-NS1) restored polyadenylation at (pA)d2 (Fig. 3B, lane 4, and C, lanes 8 and 13), which suggested that NS1 is necessary for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Transfection of the NP1 knockout plasmid (pHBoV1-NP1KO) to HEK293T cells resulted in decreased polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2 as measured by using 3\u2032 RACE (Fig. 3B, lanes 5) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 9). However, the ratio of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 to (pA)d was not changed.

However, the abundance of RNA transcripts polyadenylated at both (pA)d and (pA)d2 (Fig. 3B, lane 6, and C, lane 10) increased more than 10-fold, which is consistent with the previous report that NP1 facilitates capsid protein expression (33).

Mutating the sequences between the U-stretch and AAUAAA resulted in reduced polyadenylation at (pA)d, but polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was not changed (Fig. 6B, lane 5). This result shows that polyadenylation at (pA)d is not required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. There is also a difference in the requirement of cis elements for polyadenylation at the two different sites. The sequences between nt 5159 and nt 5196 are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d. Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 only requires sequences between nt 5178 and nt 5196. Replacing the (pA)d and downstream sequences with a synthetic polyadenylation signal resulted in strong polyadenylation at (pA)d but a loss of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 (Fig. 6B, lane 6), which further confirmed that a strong polyadenylation at (pA)d inhibited polyadenylation at (pA)d2.",

In contrast to the distal polyadenylation sites of BPV and MVC, which are located in the right-end palindromic terminus, the (pA)d of HBoV is located about 400 nt upstream of the right-end hairpin. VP1/VP2-encoding mRNAs are efficiently polyadenylated downstream of the AAUAAA site. Polyadenylation signals include the hexanucleotide AAUAAA or its variants, the cleavage site CA dinucleotide, downstream U-rich elements, and G/U-rich upstream elements. However, (pA)d2 of HBoV is located in the loop of REH, and no classical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal was found around (pA)d2. The last 42 nucleotides of the stem-loop structure of HBoV and MVC are almost identical. It is possible that HBoV and MVC use similar mechanisms for polyadenylation at the stem-loop region. The only puzzling thing is that there is no polyadenylation site immediately upstream of (pA)d2.

Mutating either the hexanucleotide AAUAAA or the DSE resulted in decreased polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2, indicating that AAUAAA and DSE of (pA)d are indispensable for the efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Interestingly, we found that polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was detected when polyadenylation at (pA)d was abolished by mutation of sequences from nt 5159 to nt 5177, which suggested that polyadenylation at (pA)d is not required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2.

The distance and sequence per se between (pA)d and (pA)d2 also affected polyadenylation efficiency at (pA)d2. Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was decreased when the distance was increased or the sequence was replaced with heterologous sequence. Thus, polyadenylation at (pA)d2 depends on the cis elements of (pA)d. Mutating the right-end hairpin structure destroyed the stem-loop structure where (pA)d2 is located and resulted in the loss of polyadenylation at (pA)d2, indicating that the hairpin structure also plays an important role in polyadenylation at (pA)d2.",

            "text": "Alternative polyadenylation is widely spread in metazoan protein-coding transcripts and leads to variable 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), which has been shown to regulate gene expression (37, 38). In the presence of the NS1 expression plasmid, transfecting pXJ40-VP2(pA)d2 resulted in polyadenylation at (pA)d and (pA)d2. We found that polyadenylation at (pA)d2 increased not only the abundance of VP1/VP2 transcripts but also the expression level of VP1/VP2 proteins. However, our results do not immediately suggest a mechanism to explain the increase in capsid protein expression, a topic we are currently investigating. The distance between (pA)d and (pA)d2 is 274 nt and affects polyadenylation efficiency at (pA)d2. This 3\u2032 noncoding region (NCR) of HBoV has been predicted to form two conserved hairpin structures and plays an important part in the replication of bocaviruses (39\u201341). The 3\u2032 NCR could function as a binding site for miRNAs or be involved in the production of noncoding RNAs to regulate protein expression (42, 43). The sequences of this region enhanced polyadenylation at (pA)d2, but the mechanism is currently unknown. Taken together, our study has demonstrated that alternative polyadenylation of HBoV capsid-encoding mRNA transcripts is regulated both by the nonstructural protein NS1 and by multiple cis elements.",

(B) Southern blot analysis. Hirt DNAs were isolated from recombinant infectious HBoV clone-transfected HEK293T cells. DpnI-digested fragments were resolved in 1% agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane, followed by hybridization of an HBoV probe spanning from nt 1 to nt 5543. Lane 2 shows the size of bands after digesting the HBoV genomic DNA with DpnI. dRF, double replication form; mRF, monomer replication form. (C) Purified recombinant HBoV viral particles were negatively stained and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy.",
