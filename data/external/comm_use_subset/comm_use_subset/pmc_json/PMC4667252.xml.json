We observed that PR8-infected WT mice appeared visibly ill with ruffled fur and reduced oral intake during the 6 to 10 days after infection, whereas Card9\u2013/\u2013mice appeared more active than WT mice. Consistent with their activity, the final survival rate up to day 21 after infection was dramatically improved in Card9\u2013/\u2013mice (~80%) as compared with WT mice (~40%; Fig. 1A). Histopathological analysis of IFV-infected lungs on days 4 and 8 revealed that lung inflammation, which was the most obvious on day 8 in WT mice, was much less severe in Card9\u2013/\u2013mice (Fig. 1B).",

Consistent with the pathological data, the number of CD45+ BALF cells were significantly fewer in the lungs of Card9\u2212/\u2212 mice than in those of WT mice on day 8, with a marked decrease in the numbers of T cells and neutrophils (Fig. 1C) that were the two main infiltrated subpopulations at this time point (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, the numbers of B cells, NK cells, macrophages, cDCs, and pDCs were not significantly affected by the CARD9 deficiency. The BALF levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, i.e., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CXCL1/KC, and CXCL10/IP-10, which have been reported to contribute to lung pathology101314, peaked on day 4 and were considerably lower in the Card9\u2212/\u2212 mice than in the WT mice (Fig. 1D). However, no reduction in cytokine/chemokine levels was evident on day 8, indicating that a CARD9-mediated innate response controls cytokine/chemokine production at an early time point after IFV infection and influences subsequent inflammatory cell recruitment and lung pathology at a later time point. Collectively, the loss of CARD9 attenuated severe influenza pneumonia and improved host mortality.",

            "text": "Activation of innate immunity in response to IFV regulates anti-viral protective immunity26. To evaluate the impact of CARD9 deficiency on anti-IFV protection, we first analyzed the viral burden in the IFV-infected lungs of WT and Card9\u2013/\u2013mice. Notably, we found that CARD9 deficiency did not increase virus titers and the amount of viral RNA in the lungs, but instead significantly accelerated viral clearance in the later stage (day 8) of infection (Fig. 2A). Type-I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) are the primary factors that induce host resistance to IFV2627. In contrast to cytokine/chemokine production, CARD9 deficiency did not significantly affect IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in IFV-infected lungs (Fig. 2B). The type II interferon IFN-\u03b3 is not essential for viral clearance28, but its presence during IFV infection ameliorates the severity of inflammation and lung injury29. IFN-\u03b3 production was significantly more in the lungs of Card9\u2212/\u2212 mice than in those of WT mice on day 8 but not on day 4 (Fig. 2B); thus, this increase might contribute to the improvement of lung pathology in Card9\u2212/\u2212 mice. Moreover, the expression of IP-10 encoded by an IFN-responsive gene was significantly impaired in Card9\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 4 (Fig. 1D), albeit no significant reduction was seen in either Type I or Type II interferons, suggesting that synergistic signals of interferons and various cytokines/chemokines are required for the higher expression of IP-10 at an early phase of infection. Next, we examined the induction of virus-specific CD8+ T cells using the H-2Db tetramer coupled with a viral nuclear protein (NP)-derived peptide (NP366\u2013374)3031. The percentages of NP-specific CD8+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes of the lungs on day 8 were comparable between WT and Card9\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2C). To evaluate the impact of CARD9 deficiency on acquired immunity to IFV, WT and Card9\u2212/\u2212 mice were immunized with a sub-lethal dose (1/10 of LD50) of the PR8 strain and rechallenged with a high lethal dose (100 LD50) of PR8 after 4 weeks. We found that CARD9 deficiency did not alter viral clearance after the challenge (Fig. 2D). Next, we assessed the induction of humoral and cellular acquired immunity to IFV in Card9\u2013/\u2013mice. We re-infected WT and Card9\u2013/\u2013mice on day 21 after their first infection (representing the second infection) and analyzed the production of virus-specific antibodies as well as the development of virus-specific CD8+ T cells on day 14 after the second infection. We found that the CARD9 deficiency affected neither the production of virus-specific IgG in the serum nor virus-specific IgA in the lung mucosa (Fig. 2E). Additionally, CARD9 deficiency did not affect the IFN-\u03b3 response by splenic CD8+ T cells specific to a NP antigen epitope NP366\u2013374 (Fig. 2F). Collectively, the CARD9 pathway is dispensable for the induction of protective immunity against both the primary and secondary IFV infections, and its deficiency even improves primary viral clearance upon lethal-dose infections probably because of improvement in lung damage and elevated IFN-\u03b3 production.",

Thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages (TG-MFs), bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMFs), alveolar macrophages (AMFs), conventional DCs (cDCs), or Flt3 ligand-induced plasmacytoid DCs (FLT3L-DCs) prepared from WT or Card9\u2013/\u2013mice were brought into contact with PR8 in vitro and the production of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was measured. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 produced by TG-MFs (Fig. 3A) or BMMFs (Fig. 3B) and those mRNAs produced by AMFs (Fig. 3C) in response to PR8 were not affected by CARD9 deficiency. As previously reported1819, CARD9 was required for a cytokine response to ox-zymosan through Dectin-1-Syk but dispensable for the response to LPS through TLR4-MyD88 in cDCs (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We found that Card9\u2013/\u2013 cDCs (Fig. 3D) or FLT3L-DCs (Fig. 3E) produced significantly lower levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 than WT cells in response to PR8. In contrast, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production was not compromised in Card9\u2013/\u2013 cDCs or FLT3L-DCs. These findings suggest that CARD9 deficiency primarily affected DCs but not MFs regarding the production of inflammatory cytokines but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to IFV. It has been reported that the CARD9-IPS-1 pathway mediates the cytokine response to RNA viruses through RLHs21, while CARD9 has been found to transmit signals from myeloid ITAM-coupled receptors via Syk181920. Thus, we evaluated the contributions of these pathways. IPS-1-deficient (Ips-1\u2013/\u2013) cDCs and Myd88-deficient (Myd88\u2013/\u2013) FLT3L-DCs produced significantly lower levels IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 than WT cells in response to PR8 (Fig. 3D,E), consistent with previous findings showing that the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response to RNA viruses is mediated mainly through RIG-I/IPS-1 in cDCs, and through TLR7/MyD88 in pDCs3233. In addition, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 production was impaired in Ips-1\u2013/\u2013 cDCs and Myd88\u2013/\u2013 FLT3L-DCs. Lower levels of cytokine production were also observed in Myd88\u2013/\u2013 cDCs, likely due to impaired activation through several TLRs (i.e. TLR3, 7, 8 and 9) that sense virus nucleic acids3435. We found that inducible Syk-deficient (Sykdel/del) cDCs and FLT3L-DCs produced significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines than WT cells similar to the responses of Card9\u2013/\u2013 cDCs and FLT3L-DCs, whereas the Syk deficiency did not affect cytokine production in response to LPS (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Consistent with these findings, treatment of WT cDCs (Fig. 4A) and FLT3L-DCs (Fig. 4B) with the Syk inhibitor BAY61-3606 reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines but not type-I interferons in response to PR8 in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment with BAY61-3606 reduced the cytokine response to ox-zymosan but not to LPS, indicating that the effect of the inhibitor on cytokine expression depends on the stimulus but cannot be attributed to its general effect on cytokine gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Overall, these results suggest that the attenuation of influenza pneumonia by Card9 deficiency was likely attributable to the reduced cytokine/chemokine production by pulmonary DCs through the Syk-CARD9 pathway in response to IFV.",

Although the Syk-CARD9-mediated innate immune response is crucial for anti-fungal acquired immunity36373839, our data showed that CARD9 was dispensable for anti-IFV immunity, as demonstrated by the findings that CARD9 deficiency did not alter viral burden, the elevation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, or the induction of anti-viral adaptive T and B cell responses in the IFV-infected mice.

In our study, CARD9 deficiency resulted in a selective reduction in inflammatory cytokines, but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production, by both cDCs and FLT3L-DCs in response to IFV. This pattern of impairment was observed in Ips-1\u2013/\u2013 cDCs, and was consistent with results from previous reports indicating that CARD9 selectively regulates the cytokine response through RIG-I-IPS-I in cDCs21. Additionally, we found that Sykdel/del and Syk inhibitor-treated cDCs showed the same pattern of impairment as Card9\u2013/\u2013 or Ips-1\u2013/\u2013 cDCs. On the other hand, in FLT3L-DCs known to release large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and type-I interferons upon recognition of IFV3233, IPS-1 deficiency affected neither cytokine or type-I interferon responses. However, Syk deficiency in FLT3L-DCs, similar to that in cDCs, resulted in a selective reduction in inflammatory cytokines but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Thus, it is likely that the Syk-CARD9 pathway controls detrimental cytokine production by pulmonary DCs upon acute influenza infection. Alternatively, because CARD9 deficiency impairs cytokine production by DCs following stimulation with several TLR ligands18, it may be important to examine whether the Syk-CARD9 pathway is involved in the TLR7-meditated response to IFV.",

It has been reported that an interaction between DC-SIGN, which possesses an ITAM-like \u201chemITAM\u201d motif, and the carbohydrate of IFV hemagglutinin induces maturation of DCs and promotes endocytosis of the virus42, indicating the signal-activating capacity of DC-SIGN upon virus binding. However, it is unclear whether the DC-SIGN hemITAM is capable of transmitting sufficient signals to produce inflammatory cytokines. With regard to other viruses, recognition of the dengue virus by the DAP12-associated CLR CLEC5A results in increased vascular permeability due to the overproduction of TNF-\u03b1, resulting in fatal outcomes43. However, its ability to recognize the IFV remains unknown. Thus, it is worth examining whether these CLRs are involved in the cytokine response to IFV. It is also conceivable that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), generated due to lung damage by IFV infection, may be ligands for some ITAM-coupled receptors. Indeed, the FcR\u03b3-associated CLR Mincle was shown to recognize SAP130, a component of the ribonucloprotein released from dead cells44.",

Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD, and are representative of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 by Student\u2019s t-test. (C) NP-specific CD8+ T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) after PR8 infection. The MLN cells of WT and Card9\u2013/\u2013 mice (n = 6 per group) were stained with anti-CD8\u03b1, anti-CD45 and anti-CD3\u03b5 mAbs, and H-2Db-NP366\u2013374 tetramer and analyzed by flow cytometry. Representative dot plots are shown after gating on CD45+ CD3\u03b5+ cells. The numbers near the outlines indicate the percentages of tetramer-specific cells. (D) Virus titers in the lungs of pre-immunized WT and Card9\u2013/\u2013 mice (n = 6 per group) two days post-challenge with a high lethal dose (106 PFU: 100 LD50) of PR8. Mice were left unimmunized or immunized with a sublethal dose (103 PFU: 1/10 LD50) of PR8 infection 28 days before challenge. (E) IFV-specific antibody production. WT and Card9\u2013/\u2013 mice (n = 6 per group) were infected twice with 103 PFU of PR8 virus on day 0 and 21. IFV-specific IgG in serum and IgA in the BALF were analyzed on day 0 and 14 after the second infection. (F) IFV-specific adaptive T cell response. Splenocytes from WT and Card9\u2013/\u2013 mice (n = 6 per group) 14 days after infection as in (E) were stimulated in vitro with IFV nucleoprotein peptide (NP366-374) for 3 days. The culture supernatants were analyzed for IFN-\u03b3 production. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD of triplicates.
