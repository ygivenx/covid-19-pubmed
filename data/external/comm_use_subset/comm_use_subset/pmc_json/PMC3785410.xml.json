To achieve good sensitivity and specificity, one or more conserved genes of each pathogen were chosen as targets. The uniqueness of all primers was checked using a full search of the GenBank database with the BLAST program [19]. The method of Tania Tabone, et al. [20] was adapted to reduce the intra-primer interaction and to further ensure the similar amplification efficiency by adding a linker sequence of 18 bases (forward universal tag sequence, UTS-F) and 19 bases (reverse universal tag sequence, UTS-R) to the 5\u2019 ends of forward and reverse primers, respectively. To further minimize the possibility of potential of primer dimers and to help ensure sufficient amplifications, the primers were divided into four independent reactions, which simplified primer design and optimization.",

In this study, a targeted multiplex PCR based on temperature-switch PCR (TSP) amplification technology was adopted and a commonly used multiplex PCR reagent was used, which increased assay sensitivity compared to conventional amplification strategy in the case of samples with heavy backgrounds (e.g., human and bacterial genome). The biphasic PCR parameters of the TSP allows a multiplex PCR to be performed under standardized PCR conditions without extensive optimization of each individual PCR assay [22]. Unique buffer in the multiplex kit promotes stable and efficient primer annealing by preventing nonspecific primers from annealing to the template and increasing the local concentration of primers at the template and allows efficient extension. This improvement therefore made it easy to group the pathogens into subsets for efficient amplification without much optimization, which allowed stable performance when new primers were added into primer mix or when the primers were changed [23].",

In contrast to RPM-Flu3.1, about 30% of which is dedicated to targeting all 16 HA and 9 NA alleles of avian influenza A viruses [26], the new resequencing array design of RPM-IVDC1 allows more coverage of respiratory viral pathogens. The two main changes of the new microarray design compared to RPM-Flu3.1 were the length of the detector tiles and the primers selected for amplification of the chosen targets. The shortening of detector tiles allows an increase in the number of probe sets to be placed on the microarray, and therefore almost all common respiratory viral pathogens could be detected by RPM-IVDC1 in a single assay. Some atypical respiratory pathogens (e.g., measles virus, rubella virus and influenza C virus) and non-respiratory virus (e.g., HHV) could be detected by RPM-IVDC1, but the probes corresponding to these are not present in RPM-Flu3.1. Furthermore, the new technology, by using one or more pairs of primers designed for amplification of conserved regions, allows rapid and efficient strain-level identification for some pathogens, which may be critical in outbreak investigations.",

In this study, sixteen single-virus infected reference specimens were used to evaluate the new microarray. The results showed excellent specificity of the new microarray for type- or strain-level identification of some reference samples. As the new resequencing microarray was designed to be smaller than previous versions to increase the hybridization efficiency, the lengths of the detector tiles of RPM-IVDC1 were much shorter and the numbers of the tiles were relatively limited. As a consequence, the conserved gene sequences obtained from detector tiles of some pathogens could differentiate samples at a strain level for only a few viruses (hMPV, CoV-OC43, RSVA, RSVB, PIV1, PIV3). In addition, some viruses have many serotypes, thus for these, the identification could only be achieved at species level (AdV, RV).",

This was particularly noticeable in the RV identification, where only 5 of the 22 RPM-identified RV infections were detected by the reference assay.

One instance of measles virus, one rubella virus and one influenza type C infection were found in patients aged 13 years, 13 years and 1 month, respectively. Rubella virus is the pathogenic agent of rubella, which is a common childhood infection but could affect anyone of any age, with the possible complications of fatal pneumonia [29]. As the causative agent of measles, the presence of the measles virus may also lead to serious problems, including measles pneumonia, which is a life-threatening complication in children [30]. Influenza C virus, which is sometimes present in patients with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, could cause a variety of respiratory illnesses that cannot be clinically differentiated from those caused by other viruses [31]. HHV is ubiquitous in humans, causing lifelong infection. After primary infection, which usually occurs during childhood, the virus remains latent in the ganglia of sensory neurons. Systemic stimuli including fever due to bacterial or viral infection can cause reaction of the virus [32] and potentially clinical disease, resulting in active secretion in the throat. Although there are few reports of symptomatic pulmonary involvement directly attributable to HHV infection [33], the presence of HHV in the throat is still a highly significant and independent risk factor for the development of lower respiratory tract infections with HHV [32,34]. Sequences of HHV-1 through HHV-6 were tiled on RPM-IVDC1 and 5 instances of HHV-1, 7 HHV-4 (EBV), 1 HHV-5 (CMV), 4 HHV-6 infections were detected using the RPM method, which was subsequently confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Of the 15 patients infected with HHV, 2 were co-infected with HHV-6 and HHV-4 and another one was co-infected with HHV-1 and HHV-4. HHV-6 virus, which causes roseola and fever after the primary infection, was identified in three children with ages under 5 and one aged 8. All HHV-1-positive samples and 5 (71.4%) of 7 HHV-4-positive specimens were from adult patients; the frequency of HHV in the NPAs (13%) of adult patients were lower than found in a previous study (22%) [32], which might be due to the difference between the sample characteristics. Although it is not possible in a retrospective study, and without the concomitant detection of bacterial pathogens, to state that these atypical pathogens were causative agents, the results of this study show the capability of RPM-IVDC1 for the detection of atypical pathogens and the potential for diagnosing infectious syndromes manifesting by similar symptoms but caused by diverse etiological agents.",
