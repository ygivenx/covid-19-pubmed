Respiratory infection caused by AdV in non-immunocompromised patients is usually mild and self-limited. In contrast, in immunocompromised patients, AdV infection can be disseminated and result in a considerable mortality rate [2\u20134]. Despite the low incidence of serious illness in non-immunocompromised patients, Levin et al. reported fatal AdV pneumonia in a previously healthy adult in 1967 [5], and sporadic cases of severe respiratory disease in non-immunocompromised adults have been reported [6\u201311] since. These reports include several outbreaks of AdV respiratory infections in previously healthy adults in vulnerable populations, such as residents of mental health care centers and military recruits [12\u201317].",

Our data suggest that early administration of cidofovir in the course of respiratory failure could be a treatment strategy worth considering in severe AdV pneumonia. In the seven cases discussed, cidofovir was administered more promptly than in previous fatal cases. In previous studies, most patients did not receive antiviral therapy with cidofovir; indeed, even in the few patients who did receive cidofovir, the administration time was not early in the course of respiratory failure [6, 8, 12] and they had poor outcomes. For example, in a recent study that evaluated outcomes in five patients with severe AdV pneumonia caused by AdV-55 infection in non-immunocompromised adults [26], similar to our study group, four (80%) of the five patients died despite receiving appropriate respiratory support and antiviral therapy, including acyclovir, ganciclovir, and ribavirin, without using cidofovir. In a study of the etiology and epidemiology of acute viral lower respiratory tract infections of South Korean soldiers in our institution, six cases of severe AdV pneumonia were identified. All six patients required mechanical ventilation, most (5/6) did not receive cidofovir, and half (3/6), including one patient who was treated with cidofovir 7 days after admission, died [17]. Moreover, in a case report of fatal AdV pneumonia in immunocompetent adult identical twins, one patient did not recover despite administration of cidofovir antiviral therapy no sooner than 8 days after the onset of symptoms [6]. In the present study, in contrast, time from admission to identification of AdV was short (median, 2 days), and all patients received antiviral therapy on the day of diagnosis of AdV infection. Given this background, our findings may indicate that administration of cidofovir early in the course of respiratory failure may be a beneficial treatment strategy in severe cases of AdV respiratory infection, and this may assist physicians in making decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment.",

Among these, human AdV-B55 has been identified as an emergent acute respiratory disease pathogen, fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing, and has caused two recent outbreaks; one in China in 2006 [33] and one in Singapore in 2005 [14]. In one study that evaluated 48 cases of AdV pneumonia [19], patients infected with human AdV-55 had higher pneumonia severity index scores compared with those infected with other serotypes. Thus, human AdV-55 could be a major pneumonia pathogen in the general population, and further surveillance and monitoring of this agent as a cause of pneumonia are warranted. However, to date, limited data on the correlation between human AdV-55 and clinical severity or clinical courses are available; and no data are available on the treatment responses to cidofovir in cases of human AdV-55 infection. In these contexts, our data may have clinical significance and further studies on the associations of AdV serotypes with severe respiratory infection are necessary.",

These features may, in part, explain the self-limiting nature of cases of even severe AdV infection without antiviral therapy, and suggest that the host\u2019s immunological reaction to the infection is a major factor in the pathogenesis of the lung injury. Moreover, this implies that antiviral therapy administered late in the course of respiratory failure may not be effective.

Although we obtained favorable outcomes, other factors may have influenced the outcomes in the study patients, such as the supportive treatment strategies, including ventilator settings and the prone position, or host factors, including young age and previous good health status, and moreover, self-limiting cases of severe AdV infection have been reported previously [9\u201311, 16]. To date, no controlled study has been reported on the benefits of antiviral therapy in severe AdV pneumonia. This may be mainly because of the rarity of severe AdV pneumonia in non-immunocompromised adults and ethical problems in using antiviral agents that have not obviously been demonstrated to have clinical effect. In this context, our data, despite the limitations, may suggest possible benefits of administering cidofovir as early as possible in severe AdV pneumonia caused mainly by human AdV-55. Based on our clinical data, further controlled studies are warranted to confirm the benefits of cidofovir. Second, despite extensive microbiological testing, the possible influences of bacterial or other co-infection on treatment outcomes cannot be excluded. Furthermore, this study included only a small number of patients. Additionally, the study population was not representative of the general population in terms of age or gender because our study was conducted at a military hospital; thus, large prospective studies are needed.",
