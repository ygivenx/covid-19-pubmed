            "text": "The role of purinergic signaling through the P2X7r during virus infection has been demonstrated using different models. During HIV infection, the activation of the pathway is important for cell-to-cell infection (23) and for the release of infectious particles from infected macrophages (24). Studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hepatitis C virus-infected patients showed that the upregulation of the P2X7r correlates with a sustained antiviral response after treatment (25). In human PBMC infected with dengue virus, activation of the purinergic signal through P2X7r modulates the immune response by reducing virus replication and killing of infected cells by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (26, 27). Finally, mice lacking the P2X7r (P2X7r KO mice) have increased survival to adenovirus infection compared to wild-type (WT) mice (28). Some studies suggest that activation of purinergic signaling through the P2X7r may be important for the immune response to influenza virus infection. A partial reduction in IL-1\u03b2 secretion was observed in bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells from virus-infected P2X7r KO mice, indicating a possible role for the receptor in NLRP3 activation (29). In a different study using tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) receptor KO mice, it was observed that after influenza virus infection, the mRNA levels of the P2X7r were lower in these mice, suggesting a role for this pathway in the TNF-\u03b1 signaling after infection (30). In addition, the levels of extracellular ATP (the P2X7r ligand) increase in the lung airways after influenza virus infection (31, 32). To determine the possible contribution of the P2X7r pathway in the induction of an exacerbated immune response during influenza virus infection, we tested the survival, cytokine production, leukocyte infiltration, and lung pathology after infection in P2X7r KO mice and compared it to wild-type mice. Overall, the KO mice have a reduced inflammatory response in the lungs, with a lower degree of lesion development, which resulted in increased survival.",

First, we confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy that these cells expressed the P2X7 receptor (Fig. 1A). One hour before infection with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR/8) virus or A/Netherlands/602/2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) (NL/09) virus, cells were treated with BBG, BzATP, or AZ11645373. No significant differences were observed in PR/8 virus growth in cells treated with BBG or BzATP compared to the untreated cells (P = 0.1) (Fig. 1B). We observed a significant reduction in virus titers in cells pretreated with AZ and infected with PR/8 at 24 h and 48 h postinfection compared to untreated cells (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). In cells infected with NL/09 virus and treated with BBG or BzATP, no significant differences were observed in virus growth (Fig. 1C).

Therefore, we infected wild-type and P2X7r KO mice with NL/09 virus, and at 4 or 7 days after infection, the lungs were harvested, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Reduced virus titers were observed in the lungs of the P2X7r KO mice compared to the wild-type mice, particularly in the samples collected on day 7 postinfection, although these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.1) (Fig. 3A). In a different set of mice, the lungs were collected on day 4 postinfection, and representative sections were prepared for histopathology. In both groups of mice, lesions were characterized as bronchointerstitial pneumonia, although the severity of the lesions differed in the groups (P < 0.05) (Table 1). In the lungs of the virus-infected P2X7r KO mice, the bronchiolar region showed mild to moderate epithelial degeneration, characterized by vacuolation and multifocal necrosis of individual epithelial cells with a thin layer of peribronchiolar inflammatory cells, and moderate perivascular inflammation with little to no presence of intraluminal debris (Fig. 3B). The bronchiolar region of the lungs from wild-type mice exhibited a marked epithelial degeneration characterized by vacuolation, segmental necrosis, and loss of the epithelium, with a thick layer of peribronchiolar inflammatory cells, and mild to marked amounts of intraluminal debris (Fig. 3C). At the alveolar level, lesions in the KO mice consisted of mild inflammation as well as tissue damage that was characterized by the presence of scattered cell necrosis with mild to moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig. 3D). The alveolar region of lungs from wild-type mice exhibited marked alveolar inflammation characterized by multifocal necrosis and marked infiltration by inflammatory cells (Fig. 3E).",

Cultured BMDM, obtained from P2X7r KO and WT mice, were infected with NL/09 virus, and supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h postinfection.

No statistical differences were observed for other cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), although a trend to significance was observed in the amount of CCL5 in samples collected at 24 h postinfection (P = 0.07). For the in vivo experiments, we first infected a set of mice (P2X7r KO and WT) with the influenza NL/09 virus, and then on day 3 postinfection, we collected lungs and sera.

When cells are under stress or damaged by infection, ATP is released into the extracellular space and rapidly binds to excitatory receptors such as P2X7 to promote an inflammatory response (9, 10, 34). Activation of the purinergic pathway through P2X7r encompasses a series of inflammation-related responses, including activation, proliferation, and recruitment of immune cells, as well as secretion of diverse inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines (7, 9, 10).",

We observed differences only in cells treated with the P2X7r antagonist AZ11645373. AZ is a potent cyclic imide (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50], 5 to 10 nM) that selectively inhibits the human P2X7r (36). In contrast, BBG, the other P2X7r antagonist used in this study, is moderately selective and less potent in blocking the human P2X7r (IC50, 200 nM) (37). Since we treated cells with the same concentration of compound (100 \u00b5M), we speculate that differences in potency may be one of the reasons why we observed some effect in virus growth with one receptor antagonist but not with the other.",

It is generally accepted that survival of the infected host correlates with a reduction of the viral burden in the lung (38, 39). However, when we quantified the virus titers in the lungs of infected mice, we observed that the virus titers in the lungs of virus-infected KO mice were not significantly different from those in the lungs of virus-infected wild-type mice. This lack of correlation between lung virus titers and severity of disease has been previously reported (6, 40, 41). In early stages of viral infection, influenza A virus (IAV) activates antiapoptotic signals to evade the host defense mechanism. However, in the later stages of infection, IAV triggers apoptosis through activation of intrinsic pathways in order to achieve enhanced viral replication and dissemination (42, 43), contributing to tissue damage. We evaluated apoptosis in lungs at day 4 postinfection in what can be considered late in infection, and we observed reduced numbers of apoptotic cells in the KO mice. Apoptosis can occur through many mechanisms, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines leading to an increased burden of apoptosis of the alveolar epithelium (44), activation of caspase cascades, including caspase-1, -3, and -8 (45), and the formation and release of reactive oxygen species (46). It is interesting that activation of the P2X7 receptor induces some of the aforementioned proapoptotic mechanisms (45, 46); therefore, the absence of this receptor is causing a reduction in apoptosis during later stages of infection.",

            "text": "During influenza virus infection, an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines positively correlates with severity of disease in humans, especially during infection with highly virulent strains of the virus (38, 47, 48). During the recent H1N1 pandemic, patients with severe disease also had high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (39). A similar correlation has been observed in animal models of influenza virus infection (49, 50). In the mouse model of influenza, mice with severe clinical signs that succumb to infection have increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and develop lung immunopathology (50\u201352). In our studies, we observed that the virus-infected P2X7r KO mice had lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, CXCL10, and CCL2 in their lungs at day 3 postinfection. Activation of P2X7 receptors by extracellular ATP plays a central role in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and it plays a role on the regulation of macrophages, neutrophils, and effector T cells, important cell mediators during inflammation (9, 11, 53, 54). Therefore, the lower level of cytokines observed in the lungs of the P2X7r KO mice after influenza virus infection may be explained by the lack of activation of this purinergic signaling pathway in these mice. We observed that IL-10 levels in the lungs of the KO mice infected with PR/8 or NL/09 were lower than those of the WT mice. IL-10 is considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine in the context of influenza virus infection, and its production relates to reduced immunopathology and increased survival (41). This discrepancy may be explained by the time when we measured IL-10 in the lungs, since the main contributors to IL-10 production in the context of influenza infection are CD8+ effector T cells, a population of cells that is found later in infection (41). In addition, increased levels of this cytokine early during infection can hinder the activation of the antiviral immune response (53), suggesting that the increased levels observed in the WT mice early during infection may be detrimental.",

Together, these results suggest that the reduced histopathology and increased survival observed in the KO mice after infection are in part due to a protective immune response at the site of infection rather than ablation of the response.",

In our studies, we observed a reduction in neutrophil influx to the airways of the KO mice at day 3 postinfection that was also evident during the analysis of the lung histology sections. An exacerbated response with an increased influx of highly proinflammatory neutrophils and the prolonged activation of these cells leads to increased tissue damage and lethality (3, 6, 60). Purinergic signaling in the presence of high concentrations of extracellular ATP has a critical role in activation of neutrophils for the production of cytokines and in the increased influx and persistence of neutrophils at the site of infection (11). Furthermore, we observed a significantly smaller amount of CXCL10 in the lungs of KO mice infected with NL/09 or PR/8 influenza virus. This chemokine is an important factor for the chemotaxis and activation (increased oxidative burst) of neutrophils, and high levels in the respiratory tract after influenza virus infection correlate with enhanced pulmonary immunopathology (61\u201363). Together, these results suggest that purinergic signaling through the P2X7 receptor is important for the recruitment and possible activation of neutrophils in the lungs after influenza virus infection.",

In addition, flow cytometry analysis of the lungs in virus-infected mice showed an increased number of CD11b+ macrophages or inflammatory macrophages in the KO mice compared to the WT mice. These cells can be proinflammatory or immunomodulatory based on the cytokine profile they produce and surface markers they express after activation (1). Lung accumulation of these inflammatory macrophages with an immunoregulatory phenotype contributes to reduce the development of immunopathology (64). Furthermore, it has been shown that maintenance of this cell population for a longer time at the site of infection correlates with protection of mice from influenza-induced immunopathology and lethality (65). The role of the P2X7 receptor in the activation of macrophages has been previously established in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro (8). Activation of the P2X7r pathway is important for the release of proinflammatory cytokines, increases in cation fluxes, respiratory burst, inhibition of phagocytosis, and apoptosis in different populations of macrophages (19, 21, 66).",

The histopathology analysis of lung sections clearly showed an increased number of infiltrating cells in the lung parenchyma of the virus-infected wild-type mice compared to the virus-infected KO mice. However, further analysis of the infiltrating cells showed that the number of CD11b+ macrophages (whole lung) and number of activated macrophages (BALF), both associated with protection, were higher in the virus-infected KO mice. Furthermore, activation of the P2X7 receptor can modify the protein secretion profile of stimulated macrophages depending on the activation status of the cells (proinflammatory or immunomodulatory), providing evidence that activation of this pathway may function to fine tune the activity of the heterogeneous population of macrophages observed through infection of the lungs (54).",

Antibodies against the following immune markers were used for discrimination of immune cell types: CD45 (30-F11; BD), CD11b (M1/70; BioLegend), CD11c (HL3; BD), Ly6c (HK1.4; eBioscience), GR1 (RB6-8C5; eBioscience), major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) (M5/114.15.2; BD), and SiglecF (E50-2440; BD). Live cells were discriminated from dead cells by using a viability dye eFluor 520 (eBioscience). All flow cytometry data were acquired on an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo LCC, Ashland, OR). Cell sorting was performed on a FACS Aria (BD).",

Leukocytes recruited to the airway space were collected by lavaging the lungs in situ by slowly injecting 1 ml of cold sterile PBS using an input 3-ml syringe with three-way stopcock and then approximately 1 ml of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from lungs using the output 3-ml syringe. We repeated this procedure three times. Cell number and cell viability were determined using trypan blue and an automatic cell counter (Countess II; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For the cytospin, 300 \u00b5l of each BALF sample containing 1 \u00d7 105 cells was spun at 600 rpm for 10 min. The slides were air dried for 2 h and then stained with Diff-Quick. The slides were evaluated in a blind manner by a trained comparative pathologist. Differential cell counts (percentage) were established by counting at least 200 cells at a high magnification (\u00d7600) using the following categorization (69). Undifferentiated alveolar macrophages were defined as relatively large, round to oval cells with eccentric round to oval nuclei and abundant granular cytoplasm, while activated macrophages were larger and contain more cytoplasm and numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles, with some macrophages binucleated. Neutrophils (10 to 15 \u00b5m in diameter) were characterized by an eosinophilic cytoplasm and a basophilic lobulated nucleus with violet granules. Inactivated lymphocytes were small (<10 \u00b5m) cells with rounded nuclei, dense nuclear chromatin, and little cytoplasm, while activated (reactive) lymphocytes were larger with more basophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. Finally, we also quantified the percentage of lysed cells by the relative proportion of isolated (naked) nuclei.",
