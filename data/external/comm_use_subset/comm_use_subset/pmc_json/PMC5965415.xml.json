Surprisingly, existing literature and guidelines give little guidance to the EP regarding an approach to empiric antimicrobial therapy for fulminant, immediately life-threatening pneumonia.",

This patient\u2019s blastomycosis was covered empirically (and as it turns out, definitively) with amphotericin from the time of his arrival in the ED.

This delay is most often due to unrecognized infection, failure to initiate antibiotic therapy in the ED, or failure to anticipate antimicrobial resistance. In fact, among hypotensive ICU patients with septic shock (nearly 40% of whom had pneumonia), each hour delay in effective antimicrobial therapy after the first hour was associated with an average decrease in survival of 8%.3 The Surviving Sepsis Campaign, while not addressing fulminant pneumonia specifically, does recommend that empiric antimicrobial therapy include one or more drugs that have activity and adequate tissue penetration against \u201call likely pathogens,\u201d including viruses and fungi.5 Professional society guidelines on the management of critically ill patients with severe CAP highlight the need to cover empirically for resistant organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).6 In our experience, patients with septic shock rarely receive antifungal or antiviral therapy. Besides knowledge of non-bacterial pathogens endemic to a certain geographic area (e.g. Coccidioides spp. and hantavirus in the southwestern U.S.), these guidelines are of limited utility to an EP caring for an intubated patient because treatment is initiated before a detailed travel and exposure history can be obtained.",

In fact, there is evidence that multilobar lung involvement is independently associated with a twofold increased likelihood of treatment failure in CAP.7,8 Usual pathogens include standard or atypical bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A Streptococcus, Legionella spp., or aerobic gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Massive aspiration can lead to a polymicrobial pneumonia that often includes anaerobes, or in the case of freshwater aspiration, infection with Aeromonas hydrophila.9 In our case, antibacterial coverage included piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. Endemic fungal infections, such as blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis, have also been associated with fulminant pneumonia; thus, we gave amphotericin. One must also consider viruses such as influenza A and B (for which we gave oseltamivir), but also varicella zoster virus10 or herpes simplex,11 and thus it may be prudent to administer acyclovir in the appropriate setting. Respiratory viruses that are prevalent, detectable on polymerase chain reaction-based assays but without specific treatment include respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, multiple coronaviruses (the etiologic agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and of Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), and hantaviruses (responsible for the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS]). Fulminant pneumonia can also be caused by rare zoonotic bacteria often recognized in the U.S. for their potential as biological weapons, namely Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Yersinia pestis (pneumonic plague), for which we gave doxycycline. Lastly, fulminant pneumonitis can be due to non-infectious vasculitic or idiopathic disorders, which are typically corticosteroid-responsive, and methylprednisolone was given in this case.",

This endemic fungus is found most commonly surrounding the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers.12 In states where blastomycosis is a reportable disease (Arkansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), it is relatively rare; annual incidence rates vary from 1\u20132 cases per 100,000 population to as high as 10\u201340 cases per 100,000 population in several northern Wisconsin counties.13,14 Fulminant pneumonia leading to ARDS and respiratory failure occurs in a minority of cases, with mortality of 50\u201389%. (Contemporary mortality may be lower in the era of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support).15,16 Extrapulmonary blastomycosis can occur by hematogenous spread of yeast to the skin, bones, and joints. Delay in diagnosis is relatively common; clinicians even in endemic areas often fail to consider blastomycosis in the initial differential for severe CAP. The diagnosis is made by isolating the organism in culture. Rapid evidence of blastomycosis is often obtained by visualizing the broad-based budding yeast forms in a sputum smear or potassium hydroxide prep. In severe infections, Blastomyces can cross-react with the urine Histoplasma antigen assay yielding a positive result before the final culture is available, as occurred in our case. Treatment of severe pulmonary or disseminated blastomycosis is with liposomal amphotericin B for 1\u20132 weeks until clinical improvement is noted, then daily itraconazole for at least one year.17",
