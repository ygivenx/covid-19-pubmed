Their fundamental activity is to catalyze the hydrolysis of an acetyl ester, and they have a broad range of substrate specificities and enzyme\u2013substrate promiscuity (Le\u0161\u010di\u0107 Asler et al., 2010 \u25b6). Their active sites all contain four absolutely conserved residues, Ser, Gly, Asn and His (hence the SGNH acronym), and the catalytic mechanism is predicted to proceed through a nucleophilic Ser which is activated by a catalytic triad that includes the conserved His and an accompanying conserved acidic residue (Le\u0161\u010di\u0107 Asler et al., 2010 \u25b6; Lo et al., 2003 \u25b6). The superfamily shares a common \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold that is frequently observed in structures with catalytic triads such as lipases and thioesterases (Le\u0161\u010di\u0107 Asler et al., 2010 \u25b6). Although this family of enzymes was identified more than 15 years ago, a full structural understanding of their broad substrate specificities, enzyme promiscuity and catalytic mechanism remains to be elucidated (Le\u0161\u010di\u0107 Asler et al., 2010 \u25b6).",

            "text": "Recently, a newly described SGNH esterase was reported, peptidoglycan (PGN) O-acetylesterase (Ape1), the primary function of which is to catalyze the de-O-acetylation of PGN (Weadge et al., 2005 \u25b6). PGN O-acetylation in Gram-negative bacteria occurs by the action of PatA and PatB, which facilitate the transfer of a acetate modification to PGN (Fig. 1 \u25b6\na; Weadge et al., 2005 \u25b6). Ape1 is present in Gram-negative bacteria that O-acetylate their PGN, and it catalyzes the hydrolysis of the O-acetyl modification specifically at the sixth carbon position of the muramoyl residue (Fig. 1 \u25b6\nb). No structural data exist for the Ape1 family of enzymes or indeed for any enzyme that is involved in PGN acetylation (Weadge et al., 2005 \u25b6), a process that allows pathogenic bacteria to subvert the host innate immune response (Diacovich & Gorvel, 2010 \u25b6; Aubry et al., 2011 \u25b6; Fig. 1 \u25b6\na). However, this modification also precludes the normal metabolism and maturation of the peptidoglycan by the endogenous hydrolases of the hexosaminidase superfamily such as lytic transglycosylases (Chan et al., 2012 \u25b6; Bera et al., 2005 \u25b6). Thus, the fine-tuning of this modification is essential for bacterial metabolism and survival. Ape1 performs this fine-tuning in Neisseria sp. (Veyrier et al., 2013 \u25b6; Dillard & Hackett, 2005 \u25b6) and is essential for virulence, similar to the viral haemagglutinin-esterase, an SGNH esterase that plays an important role in the pathogenicity of some viruses such as influenza C virus, coronavirus and H5 avian and H9 swine influenza viruses (Rosenthal et al., 1998 \u25b6; Zeng et al., 2008 \u25b6; Desforges et al., 2013 \u25b6; Ha et al., 2002 \u25b6).",

Three important outstanding issues to be resolved are the geometry and activation mechanism of the catalytic triad, the precise architecture of the oxyanion hole and the structural basis of the substrate promiscuity. To address these questions, we first determined the crystal structure of Ape1 and then trapped and structurally characterized two intermediates along its catalytic pathway: the bound substrate before catalysis and the covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate.",

Ape1 crystallized in space group P212121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (termed A and B; see Supplementary Fig. S11 for an expanded view) and the structure reveals a two-domain architecture (Figs. 2 \u25b6\na and 2 \u25b6\nb). The C-lobe is split and comprises residues 45\u201399 and 227\u2013393, and the intervening N-lobe comprises residues 104\u2013221 (Figs. 2 \u25b6\na and 2 \u25b6\nb and Supplementary Fig. S2). Two short linkers connect these domains, residues 100\u2013103 and 222\u2013226, and this suggests a tightly packed structure with a limited degree of N/C-lobe domain rearrangement or interaction (Figs. 2 \u25b6\na and 2 \u25b6\nb). This was further explored using the ElN\u00e9mo normal-mode web server (Suhre & Sanejouand, 2004 \u25b6; http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/elnemo/). A normal-mode analysis in the lowest energy conformations revealed negligible rearrangement of the N- or C-lobes (Supplementary Fig. S2), although there were some predicted intermolecular movements within the lobes independently (Supplementary Fig. S2).",

Based on sequence analyses, the N-lobe was not predicted to resemble any structure currently in the PDB, but DALI and PDBeFold revealed that the fold matched that of the carbohydrate-binding module of family 35 (CBM35; Fig. 2 \u25b6\nc). These non\u00adcatalytic modules (CBMs) are frequently found in enzymes that need to be targeted to carbohydrate-associated substrates, and are commonly appended to plant cell-wall-degrading enzymes (Montanier et al., 2009 \u25b6). The interaction of the N-lobe with a specific carbohydrate moiety would therefore possibly explain how Ape1 is able to select PGN when presented with an array of possible substrates in vivo (Montanier et al., 2009 \u25b6). A more detailed analysis of the structure and substrate specificity of the N-lobe will be presented elsewhere.",

In addition, the space afforded by Gly236 together with the OD1 atom of Asn268 are well placed to mediate substrate binding (Fig. 4 \u25b6, 0 min). Within the catalytic triad, Ser80 is flanked by Asp79 and His81, which appear to provide structural support to the catalytic residue (Fig. 4 \u25b6, 0 min) and establish a barricade for the active-site groove, but this is inconsistent with previous studies that suggest that these residues position or facilitate substrate interaction or binding (Pfeffer et al., 2013 \u25b6). Meanwhile, the backbone amide N atom of Val368 appears to orient Asp366 with respect to His369 via a hydrogen-bonding interaction and Thr267 structurally supports the catalytic residues.",

The acetylated PGN substrate is insoluble and the available acetylated substrate analogues rapidly turn over to products. We took advantage of the well known fact that some enzymes are able to catalyze both reverse and forward reactions, in some cases rather efficiently. The canonical serine protease, which is the best documented example of an enzyme that proceeds via a catalytic triad, can reconstruct peptide hydrolysis (Zakharova et al., 2009 \u25b6). Ape1 catalyzes the removal of the O-acetyl group from the muramyl residue of the polymeric PGN, thus releasing an unmodified muramyl residue and free acetate (Fig. 1 \u25b6\nb). We rationalize that a valid product mimic of the reverse reaction would be muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a monosaccharide substructure of the polymeric PGN, along with acetate. Serendipitously, the crystals already contained trace amounts of acetate, a byproduct that is frequently found in the active site of SGNH esterases (Figs. 3 \u25b6\na\u20133 \u25b6\nd) and is possibly introduced by the crystallization precipitant. To reconstruct acetyl hydrolysis in the crystalline state, a tenfold excess of MDP was added to crystals that already contained trace amounts of acetate before flash-cooling them in liquid nitrogen at time points of 5 and 30 min (Fig. 4 \u25b6, 5 and 30 min). We were able to capture two key steps in the catalytic mechanism that were well defined in our electron-density maps at the 5 min time point: bound acetate in chain A and the covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate in chain B (Fig. 4 \u25b6, 5 min; Supplementary Fig. S4). Acetate was not visible in the active site of the apo structure and we are confident that its appearance in these structures is indeed the result of catalysis. Moreover, Ape1 is highly specific for the presence of the O-acetyl group and solely catalyzes the O-acetyl modification of the polymeric PGN; it does not appear to utilize N-acetyl-containing substructures of PGN such as MDP, MurNAc or GlcNAc (Weadge & Clarke, 2006 \u25b6; Veyrier et al., 2013 \u25b6).",

The acetate ion is buried in a groove adjacent to Ser80 with one of its O atoms hydrogen-bonded to three N atoms: the backbone amides of Ser80 and Gly235 and ND2 of Asn268 (Fig. 4 \u25b6, 5 min, chain A). These three hydrogen bonds were previously noted in the E. coli thioesterase (TAP) structure (Lo et al., 2003 \u25b6) and prompted the suggestion that the oxy\u00adanion hole unusually comprises three participating N atoms. The shape of this groove complements the bound acetate, and this may explain the preference that Ape1 shows for O-acetyl-containing substrates such as p-nitrophenyl acetate (Fig. 4 \u25b6, 5 min; Weadge & Clarke, 2006 \u25b6; Pfeffer et al., 2013 \u25b6). The acetate-binding groove is the only portion of the active-site region that is buried, suggesting that the rest of the PGN substrate is exposed (Fig. 3 \u25b6 and Fig. 4 \u25b6, 5 min). However, a bound HEPES molecule adjacent to the acetate in the 5 min soaked structure may mimic the PGN substrate, and this suggests that Phe271 and Lys310 may contribute to the substrate-binding site (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6).",

In the absence of substrate Ser80 points towards the oxyanion hole, where it is hydrogen-bonded to Gly236, and the enzyme appears to be in the \u2018parked\u2019 position (Fig. 5 \u25b6, step 1). In the presence of substrate, the O\u03b3 atom of Ser80 rotates to accommodate the acetate moiety and aligns with His369 to form the catalytic triad (Ser80\u2013His369\u2013Asp366). The now activated Ser80 then attacks the carbonyl C atom of an ester-linked acetate group on the muramoyl residue (Fig. 5 \u25b6, step 2), leading to the formation of a tetrahedral species with the assistance of the now available oxy\u00adanion hole (Fig. 5 \u25b6, step 3). The intermediate then collapses and leads to the formation of the covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 5 \u25b6, step 4), with concomitant release of the product. Finally, a water molecule enters and the acetate is hydrolyzed from the catalytic Ser80 (Fig. 5 \u25b6, step 5), thereby returning Ser80 to its protonated state in which the active site is regenerated for another catalytic cycle (Fig. 5 \u25b6, step 5). As regards substrate promiscuity, we suggest that the rotational flexibility of the catalytic serine combined with the generally open substrate-binding groove but the snug acetate-binding pocket may enable Ape1 to bind and process a range of distinct but structurally related O-acetylated substrates as large as the polymeric PGN and as small as p-nitrophenyl acetate (Weadge & Clarke, 2006 \u25b6).",

In contrast to other serine protease-like mechanisms studied thus far, we observed rotation of the side chain of Ser80 into its catalytically competent position in response to the binding of substrate (Fig. 4 \u25b6, 0 and 30 min). Gly236 plays a crucial role in supporting the formation and hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, but also appears to provide a gate that potentially closes the active site in the absence of substrate (Fig. 4 \u25b6, 5 min, chain A). Asn268 plays a key role in stabilizing the substrate and the acyl-enzyme intermediate and possibly the unobserved tetrahedral intermediate. His369 influences the nucleophilic catalysis of Ser80 by maintaining the proton relay of the catalytic triad in the presence of substrate. These snapshots provide a detailed view of the enzyme-catalyzed acetyl transfer of a SGNH esterase. They illustrate for the first time a substrate-induced catalytic triad, an enzyme mechanistic model that is potentially conserved within the diverse SGNH esterase superfamily (Fig. 3 \u25b6). These structures also offer additional insights into the catalytic roles of the absolutely conserved SGNH residues in this diverse superfamily (Figs. 3 \u25b6 and 4 \u25b6) and reveal important intermediates in the catalytic mechanism of Ape1 (Fig. 4 \u25b6).",
