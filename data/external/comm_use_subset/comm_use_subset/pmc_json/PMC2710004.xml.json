            "text": "The orthopoxviruses (family Poxviridae, genus Orthopoxvirus) are a diverse group of large, enveloped viruses that contain a covalently closed, double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 200 kbp [1]. The genus is comprised of at least 10 recognized species. Several viruses within this group are significant human pathogens, including Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox), monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and Vaccinia virus. Other members, including raccoonpox, camelpox, ectromelia (mousepox), taterapox, and volepox viruses have only been isolated from their respective mammalian hosts. Although many orthopoxviruses specifically infect certain animal hosts, others (e.g., monkeypox and cowpox viruses) can also infect humans and are considered zoonotic pathogens. In humans, symptoms of orthopoxvirus infections range from mild skin lesions to fatal systemic disease. For example, smallpox produced a generalized rash that progressed from the papular to vesicular to pustular stages and resulted in a greater than 30% mortality rate in unvaccinated persons [2]. Although naturally-occurring smallpox was eradicated nearly three decades ago [3], official stocks of the virus still remain in two locations, one at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA and the other at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, Novosibirsk, Russia. This, in addition to waning immunity against smallpox within the human population, has led to concerns that Variola virus might be used as a bioweapon [4].",

Monkeypox virus is primarily transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals, generally various species of rodents or squirrels in the rain forests of central Africa. However, additional attention was brought to bear on this virus when, in the spring of 2003, it emerged for the first time in the Western Hemisphere and caused a cluster of cases in the U.S. Midwest [6].",

It was also the first animal virus to be purified and chemically analyzed and was the first to be genetically engineered [7]. Despite its notoriety, however, its origin and natural history remain obscure. Recent evidence suggests that Vaccinia virus and horsepox virus are very similar phylogenetically and share a relatively recent common ancestor [8]. Vaccinia virus is often confused with cowpox virus; although it is now well established that they are distinct virus species [9]. In fact, cowpox virus is considered a zoonotic pathogen and is seen in a broad range of host species, most notable wild rodents, but rarely in cattle, as its name would imply. Interestingly, wild and domestic cats and elephants appear to be highly susceptible to infection with cowpox virus [9]. Numerous recent studies have uncovered several novel vaccinia-like viruses that have caused zoonotic outbreaks in Brazil [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. It is likely that as various ecological niches are examined further, even more species of Orthopoxvirus will be identified.",

More recently, several real-time LightCycler-based PCR assays have been developed for pan-Orthopoxvirus or specific orthopoxvirus species detection [19], [20], [21]. For these assays, differentiation of the various orthopoxvirus species requires the use of different TaqMan probes in separate reactions or melt-curve analysis of hybridization probes. Here, we describe a rapid, high-throughput, multi-locus method for identifying orthopoxviruses based on PCR amplification followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) performed on the Ibis T5000 instrument [22], [23], [24], [25]. This technology has been applied to detection and identification of other viral pathogens, including alphaviruses [26], influenza viruses [27], adenovirus [28], and coronaviruses [29]. The assay described here is extremely sensitive and able to detect and identify each species from a diverse collection of orthopoxviruses.",

The goal of this work was to develop a simple assay that would allow the detection of all of the diverse members of this group of viruses. Several sets of primers were evaluated for their analytical sensitivity, pan-Orthpoxvirus coverage and performance under uniform PCR conditions. Four primer pairs were chosen for use in the final assay format (Table 1). Several of the primers have non-homologous nucleotides at their 5\u2032 ends to raise the temperature of melting (Tm) of the primers after the first round of amplification as orthopoxviruses have a low GC genome. Primer Pair VIR982 exhibited the greatest analytical sensitivity of the four primers in the assay. Figure 1 shows the alignment of this primer pair against the known sequences of several diverse orthopoxviruses. For each primer region, a database of expected base compositions (A, G, C, and T base counts) from all known orthopoxvirus sequences in GenBank was generated (data not shown) and used in the identification and classification of the test isolates.",

Though Variola virus has been eradicated there is still the potential for its reintroduction into the human population through an act of bioterrorism. It is also possible that a zoonotic orthopoxvirus could emerge as a variola-like virus of humans or be used as a bioterrorist agent. A single assay that can detect and identify all orthopoxviruses is critical for effective surveillance. Though several methods exist for the detection and surveillance of orthopoxvirus, these assays are limited in their coverage or require large numbers of reactions to identify all Orthopoxvirus species. In this study, we describe an assay using four PCR primer pairs that can identify and distinguish all orthopox species and can provide subspecies level of identification of several important orthopoxviruses. Our primers target the highly conserved core viral DNA and RNA polymerase and helicase genes and thus it is very likely that novel orthopox viruses will also be detected using this strategy.",
