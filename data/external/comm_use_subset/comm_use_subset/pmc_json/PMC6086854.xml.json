Of those, 3310 were positive for H1N1 influenza virus, accounting for 92% of the 3606 virus\u2010positive samples.3 There were 1809 complicated cases due to novel A H1N1 influenza infection during 2009\u20102010 in Taiwan.4 Severe H1N1 pneumonitis would result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi\u2010organ failure, and associated with prolonged use of mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).5 The mortality associated with severe H1N1 infections was reported as high as 20%\u201040%.6 In a study of 320 pandemic influenza pneumonia in Japan, 43 (13.4%) had received invasive mechanical ventilation and 7.8% died of severe pneumonia.7\n",

The pulmonary function abnormalities correlated with decreased health\u2010related quality of life for domains reflecting physical function in survivors of ARDS.8 Schelling and colleagues demonstrated that patients with more abnormality on pulmonary function tests had the lowest health\u2010related quality of life.25 In patients with H1N1\u2010ARDS, Quispe\u2010Laimea et al found there was no correlation between lung diffusion and quality of life at 6 months.22 In our patients, the quality of life measured by SGRQ improved but not reached to statistical significance in the first 3 months despite significant improvement in pulmonary function tests and 6MWD. The total score of SGRQ decreased significantly from 3 to 6 months, although the measurements of pulmonary functions and 6MWD had no significant increase during this period. Our findings indicated that there would be a further improvement of quality of life even after the improvement of pulmonary functions or exercise capacity reached to plateau levels.",

The declines in physical function may even persist at 8 years.26 Several studies had reported pulmonary rehabilitation can help to improve exercise capacity, sleep quality, depression, and health\u2010related quality of life. With the limited number of patients included in this study, we did not compare the outcomes between H1N1\u2010ARDS patients with and without pulmonary rehabilitation. All of the patients in our study received similar pulmonary rehabilitation program because we thought that pulmonary rehabilitation could be beneficial to the recovery of physical status in these severely ill patients. Therefore, this could partly explain why our patients had more significant improvement after survived form H1N1\u2010ARDS. However, further studies are needed to identify the optimal therapeutic interventions in a timely and targeted manner.",
