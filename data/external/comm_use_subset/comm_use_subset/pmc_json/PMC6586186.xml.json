Moreover, as GrippeWeb also collects information if a person with ARI consults a physician for his or her illness GrippeWeb data on \u201cARI with ensuing consultation of a primary health care provider\u201d could be successfully compared and cross\u2010validated with data on \u201cphysician consultations due to ARI\u201d generated by the German sentinel physician network \u201cArbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza\u201d (AGI).6\n",

            "text": "Most physician sentinel networks use a second pillar, namely microbiological analyses of respiratory samples taken from primary care patients, to assist in the interpretation of syndromic data derived from the same patient population. In contrast, population\u2010based, participatory surveillance systems typically lack this kind of information. Thus, there is little up\u2010to\u2010date information what kind of pathogens cause respiratory infections that may or may not lead to physician consultations. However, longitudinal information on the type of pathogens would be helpful to interpret syndromic data, focus on specific risk groups, calculate (pathogen\u2010specific) burden of disease estimates, support therapeutic decisions (eg, regarding the use or non\u2010use of antibiotic therapy) and, finally, guide decisions on the development of vaccines that could reduce disease of responsible pathogens. To keep complexity and cost low, the very nature of these participatory surveillance instruments calls for a simple mechanism of respiratory sample collection by participants themselves. Self\u2010collection may be more acceptable when nasal or particularly anterior nasal swabs can be used. While in clinical practice pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs are taken frequently for upper respiratory illness, it has been shown that for influenza and other respiratory viruses, nasal swabs are at least equally sensitive if not superior to pharyngeal specimens.7, 8 Furthermore, Akmatov demonstrated that self\u2010collected and medical staff\u2010collected nasal swabs were equivalent in acceptance and the capability to detect pathogens.11 We therefore designed a feasibility study (\u201cGrippeWeb\u2010Plus\u201d) to test if self\u2010collection of anterior nasal swabs is logistically possible, acceptable for participating adults and children, and if it yields valid microbiological results that are capable to complement syndromic surveillance data.",

Parents can report for their children aged 13 years or younger. Upon registration, participants answer questions on demographic variables, lifetime physician\u2010diagnosed chronic conditions, smoking, household size, daily occupation and main mode of transportation used. Participants receive weekly emails summarizing the GrippeWeb results published on the system's website and reminding them to complete the weekly online questionnaire. In this questionnaire, participants are asked whether they have experienced the onset of a new respiratory illness during the previous week. If the participant has had a respiratory illness with new symptom onset, participants were additionally asked to report the date of onset, selected symptoms from a short list (cough, sore throat, fever and coryza), if they have consulted a physician because of the illness and whether they have been able to continue their usual daily occupation. Influenza vaccination is recorded weekly during the winter season. Participants can report weekly answers retrospectively up to a maximum of four weeks. Reported illnesses are recorded in the participant's personal password\u2010protected online diary and can be accessed online at any time. In February 2016, about 4500\u20105000 participants from all over Germany delivered their weekly report, ensuring a broad geographical representation.",

Of note, the ILI definition in the AGI includes fever + one systemic symptom such as headache or myalgia + one respiratory symptom and differs therefore from the ILI definition in GrippeWeb. Since the proportion of samples among children was very similar compared to that in the virological surveillance system in the AGI during the same weeks (42% among GrippeWeb\u2010Plus samples; 40% among AGI samples) and for specific pathogens numbers became very small, no age\u2010adjusted PR was calculated.

In general, the possibility to detect a pathogen by PCR depends on the specimen taken (eg, nose swab, throat swab) and the time point of swab collection after symptom onset.7, 9 Thus, not detecting a pathogen does not necessarily mean absence of the pathogen in the patient.
