            "text": "Respiratory viruses pose a significant threat to human health. In particular, annual influenza epidemics are associated with several hundred thousand deaths every year, and interspersed pandemics may wreck even greater havoc [1], as documented by the 1918 Spanish influenza, which caused 30 to 50 million deaths [2]. Antiviral drugs against influenza are available but their effectiveness is compromised by frequent acquisition of viral resistance. Moreover, no drugs with broad antiviral activity are available to combat emerging and highly virulent respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV. In order to close this gap, novel antiviral strategies are being sought, which allow inhibition of a broad spectrum of viruses and which are associated with a high barrier against resistance development. Host cell factors which are essential for viral spread but dispensable for cellular survival are attractive targets for such approaches to antiviral therapy.",

            "text": "The surface proteins of influenza A viruses (FLUAV) and coronaviruses, termed hemagglutinin (HA) and spike (S), respectively, facilitate viral binding to host cells and fusion of the viral envelope with a host cell membrane [3]. These proteins are synthesized as inactive precursors and are converted by host cell proteases into their active forms [4], a process referred to as activation in the remainder of the manuscript. Activation is essential for viral infectivity and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for antiviral therapy. Recent work indicated that several respiratory viruses hijack the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 for their activation. Thus, TMPRSS2 was shown to cleave and activate the HA proteins of diverse FLUAV in culture [5\u20138] and studies with tmprss2-deficient mice indicated that TMPRSS2 expression is essential for spread and pathogenesis of FLUAV [9\u201311]. Moreover, augmented TMPRSS2 expression was found to be associated with increased risk of severe influenza upon infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus and with increased susceptibility to H7N9 FLUAV infection [12]. Finally, TMPRSS2 was shown to activate diverse CoVs [13\u201316], parainfluenza virus [17], human metapneumovirus [18] and hepatitis C virus [19] in cell culture and might contribute to viral spread in the host. Remarkably, the absence of TMPRSS2 does not compromise development or homeostasis [20], indicating that TMPRSS2-specific inhibitors might exert broad antiviral activity without causing substantial unwanted side effects.",

For instance, the presence of an alternative first exon in the corin mRNA can alter surface localization of the protein and conversion of the zymogen form into the mature enzyme [21]. It has been suggested that the tmprss2 transcript can be alternatively spliced [23,24], which may result in the production of two isoforms which differ only in the N-terminal, cytoplasmic tail: Isoform 1 contains 37 amino acids in its tail which are not present in isoform 2. However, previous analyses of TMPRSS2 in the context of viral infections have exclusively focused on isoform 2 while expression of isoform 1and its ability to cleave and activate the surface proteins of respiratory viruses has not been assessed.",

Isoform 2 has been shown to activate the envelope proteins of several viruses while it is at present unknown whether isoform 1 can also act as a viral activator. Moreover, it is unknown whether the isoforms are differentially expressed in viral target cells. To address these questions, we cloned the transcript variants encoding for each individual isoform and analyzed whether the proteins are efficiently expressed in transfected cells. The expression levels of TMPRSS2 isoforms 1 and 2 were comparable as determined by Western blot (Fig 1B) and flow cytometry (Fig 1C) and unprocessed isoform 1 exhibited a slightly higher molecular weight than its counterpart (Fig 1B), in keeping with expectations (expected molecular weight isoform 1, 57.7 kDa; expected molecular weight isoform 2, 53.9 kDa). Both proteins were autocatalytically activated (i.e. the inactive zymogen form was cleaved between the C-terminal protease domain and the remainder of the protein, which allows the protease domain to undergo conformational changes and to transit into an active state), as evidenced by the presence of N-terminal cleavage products. A single N-terminal fragment was observed for isoform 2 while two fragments were detected for isoform 1 (Fig 1B), suggesting that the presence of an extended N-terminus in isoform 1 does not alter the efficiency of TMPRSS2 auto-activation but might change cleavage specificity.",

Similarly, the PCR designed to amplify transcript variant 2 was negative when a plasmid encoding isoform 1 was used as template but generated the expected amplificate from cDNA prepared from several cell lines and tissues, indicating that also this PCR was specific. In this context, it should be noted that the forward primer used for detection of transcript variant 2 binds to a 5\u2019-untranslated region which is absent from the plasmid encoding isoform 2.

A similar result was obtained when expression in cell lines was determined (Fig 2, right panel): Transcript variant 1 was expressed in several but not all cell lines tested, including the lung-derived cell line Calu-3 and the colon-derived cell line Caco-2, which were previously shown to produce TMPRSS2 protein [5,6].

Thus, all organs and cell lines positive for transcript variant 1 also expressed variant 2 except for muscle tissue, which was negative for variant 2. Conversely, heart tissue and the cell lines A549 and EA-hy were negative for transcript variant 1 but expressed variant 2. Collectively, tmprss2 transcript variant 1 and variant 2 exhibit an overlapping but not identical expression pattern.

Activation of SARS-S and MERS-S by TMPRSS2 isoform 2 occurs during viral entry into target cells and renders this process independent from the activity of cathepsin L [14\u201316,29,30], an endosomal cysteine protease which can activate SARS-S and MERS-S for entry into TMPRSS2-negative cells [29\u201331]. We investigated whether TMPRSS2 isoform 1 can also activate SARS-S and MERS-S. Western blot analysis of protease and SARS-S or MERS-S transfected cells revealed that both TMPRSS2 isoforms processed the S proteins comparably (Fig 5A and data not shown). Moreover, SARS-S- and MERS-S-driven entry into control cells was markedly reduced by pre-incubation of cells with MDL28170, a cathepsin B and L inhibitor, and this effect was rescued by TMPRSS2 isoform 2 and DESC1 but not TMPRSS3 (Fig 5B and 5C), in keeping with published data [14\u201316,25,29,30]. Similarly, rescue was observed upon expression of isoform 1 (Fig 5B and 5C), indicating that the extended N-terminus is compatible with coronavirus S protein activation during entry.",

It has been suggested that tmprss2 mRNA may be alternatively spliced [23,24] and two transcript variants were documented at NCBI, which only differ in the first exon. The encoded proteins are identical except for the presence of an extended cytoplasmic domain in isoform 1 and the impact of this extension on expression and function was unknown. The present study shows that isoform 1 is efficiently expressed in transfected cells and, in keeping with expectations, exhibits a slightly increased molecular weight relative to isoform 2. Thus, the enzymatically inactive zymogen form of isoform 1 migrated slower than its counterpart in isoform 2 (the two bands observed might be the result of differential glycosylation) and differences were also observed for the N-terminal fragment of the protease, which is generated upon autocatalytic activation. Notably, two prominent N-terminal fragments were consistently observed for isoform 1 but not for isoform 2. Thus, the extended cytoplasmic domain might give rise to the expression of different glycoforms or, maybe more likely, might alter the specificity of autocatalytic cleavage, which is essential for the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2. In fact, an impact of the cytoplasmic domain on the autocatalytic activation has previously been reported for the TTSP corin, in which the presence of a shortened cytoplasmic tail, due to the use of an alternative exon 1, reduces plasma membrane localization and autocatalytic activation [21].",

In general, the expression patterns of transcript variant 1 and 2 were similar but not identical, suggesting that in certain tissues only isoform 1 might be available for viral activation. Whether the mRNA expression data match the expression of protein remains to be determined and such studies are complicated by the absence of isoform-specific antibodies. No major differences in the cellular localization of the two isoforms were observed, although distribution of isoform 2 at or close to the cell surface was more homogenous than that of isoform 1, which was frequently detected within speckles.
