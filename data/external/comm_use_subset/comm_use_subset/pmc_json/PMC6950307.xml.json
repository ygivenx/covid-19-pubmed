            "text": "Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) causes high mortality rates in wild and farmed tilapia. The disease caused by TiLV was first reported in Israel in 2009, while the virus was first characterized in 2014 [1]. Since then, TiLV infections have been reported from different countries around the world [2,3,4,5]. It is an icosahedral virus made of a trilaminar capsid with a diameter of 55\u2013110 nm, which is morphologically similar to orthomyxoviruses [1]. Its genome is made of -ssRNA consisting of 10 segments, of which segment 1 has a weak homology with the influenza virus C PB1 subunit (~17% amino acid identity, 37% segment coverage). In addition, it has four motifs (I\u2013IV) conserved in RNA-dependent RNA and RNA-dependent DNA polymerases that are homologous with influenza A, B, and C viruses [6]. As such, TiLV was initially proposed to be an orthomyxo-like virus belonging to the genus Tilapinevirus based on ultrastructural, chemical, and weak sequence similarities with orthomyxoviruses, but was recently classified as the only genus of the family Amnoonviridae of the order Articulavirales. It is transmitted horizontally from infected to susceptible fish [1], although vertical transmission has also been reported [7]. Clinical signs include lethargy, exophthalmia, haemorrhages, irregular swimming, and skin erosions [1]. Mortality ranges between 10% and 90% in TiLV-infected tilapia. Mortality caused by TiLV has been reported in various countries such Egypt, Thailand, Peru, Malaysia, India, and Ecuador [1,2,5,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Current control measures are mostly focused on the implementation of biosecurity measures.",

            "text": "Influenza A and B viruses contain envelope-associated proteins, namely, hemagglutinins (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), inserted into the lipid bilayer, which protrude from the outer surface as spikes. HAs play vital roles in virus entry by binding to sialic acid (Sia) on epithelial cell surfaces, which promotes fusion of the envelope to the cell membrane [14,15]. On the other hand, NA cleaves sialic acid on virion proteins to prevent clumping and facilitates virus release from infected cells [16]. During viral infection or budding, HA is activated when its precursor, HA0, is cleaved by membrane-bound host trypsin-like proteases into HA1 (50 kDa) and HA2 (25 kDa) subunits [15,17,18]. The HA1 subunits of the influenza A and C viruses contain a shallow pocket of conserved amino acids at the distal tip (receptor-binding site) that binds to Sia receptors, either \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6 linkages [19]. The HA2 subunit contains the hydrophobic peptide required for membrane fusion [15,20]. Sialic acids (Sia) are among the class of monosaccharides containing a nine-carbon backbone, which normally attach to the glycans of animal cells [17,21]. In general, red blood cells (RBCs) from different host species possess both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 linkages, where viruses containing HAs bind [22]. For example, influenza viruses agglutinate avian, mammalian, and piscine RBCs, while infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) agglutinate RBCs from cold-water-adapted piscine species [23]. The term hemagglutinin was coined due to the binding ability and aggregation (hemagglutination) of RBCs by the virus [16]. This viral property led to use of the HA assay, first introduced by Hirst [16] in the early 1940s, as a method to identify and quantify viruses that agglutinate RBCs. The HA assay is based on the principle of hemagglutination, in which HA binds to Sia receptors on RBCs, forming lattices that keep RBCs in suspension and appearing as a diffuse suspension. The ability of TiLV to agglutinate RBCs from tilapia or other host species has not been determined, despite the identified similarities with orthomyxoviruses.",

The fusion of viral envelopes with endosomal membranes is highly dependent on the low endosomal pH (<6.0). Inhibiting endosomal acidification using weak basic lysosomotropic agents such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and chloroquine that diffuse across lysosomal membranes due to protonation have been shown to interfere with orthomyxovirus replication [25,26]. Hence, in the present study, we wanted to determine whether the replication of TiLV could be inhibited by endosomal membrane fusion inhibitors, such as NH4Cl. Given that TiLV has been shown to have some properties that are similar to influenza viruses, we also wanted to determine whether TiLV agglutinated piscine and avian RBCs, as seen in influenza viruses and ISAV. We found that TiLV did not agglutinate RBCs from any of the species included in the present study, thereby suggesting an absence of surface proteins with hemagglutination properties, pointing toward receptors other than sialic acid types for uptake. Resistance toward lysosomotropic agents indicated that the viral uptake mechanisms were independent of acidification.",

E-11 cells were used to propagate TiLV, while SHK-1 cells were used to grow ISAV. Near confluent monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by adding the virus suspension and incubation for 1 h at 28 \u00b0C (TiLV) and 15 \u00b0C (ISAV) to allow virus adsorption onto the cells. The cell culture flasks were gently tilted to ensure uniform distribution of the virus solution on the cell monolayer. After 1 h of virus adsorption, the unbound virus was washed off three times using PBS and freshly prepared growth media containing 2.5% FBS was added to the cells. Cell culture flasks infected with TiLV were cultured at 28 \u00b0C, while ISAV-infected flasks were cultured at 15 \u00b0C. The virus was harvested when the cytopathic effect (CPE) was fully developed by centrifugation of the supernatant from each flask at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The virus supernatant harvested from each flask was filtered at a size of 22 \u03bcm to remove cell debris. Each virus was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. The influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8, designated as PR8 in this study, was grown in the allantois membranes of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and harvested after 3 days. The PR8 virus was kindly provided by Professor Espen Rimstad of Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) in Norway.",

Confluent monolayers were washed twice using PBS before treatment using various concentrations of NH4Cl. Experiments using NH4Cl treatment of E-11 cells were done in two parts, of which the first part was to determine the toxicity of different concentrations of NH4Cl on E-11 cells. To do this, the concentrations of NH4Cl tested were 1, 5, 20, 25, 30, and 50 mM. Once the different NH4Cl concentrations mixed with growth media were put on the cells followed by incubation at 28 \u00b0C, the cells were observed every hour to check for toxicity based on morphological changes and cell death. The second part was to test the impact of NH4Cl on replication of TiLV in E-11 cells once the optimal duration that did not cause toxicity on the cells was determined. To do this, cells were treated with NH4Cl during virus adsorption, while post-adsorption treatment was done at 1, 2, or 3 h post-infection (hpi). Cells were infected with TiLV at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1.0 and adsorbed for 1 h at 28 \u00b0C to allow for virus binding onto E-11 cells. The cell culture flasks were gently tilted to ensure uniform distribution of the virus solution on the cell monolayer. After 1 h of virus adsorption, any unbound virus was washed off three times using PBS. The cells were cultured in normal growth media containing 5% FBS after NH4Cl treatment. Three negative control cell culture flasks without NH4Cl treatment and cells treated with NH4Cl but without virus infection were included in the study. The positive control group consisted of cells infected with the virus at MOI 1.0 without NH4Cl treatment. All cells were incubated at 28 \u00b0C and monitored daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) development. Once CPE was observed, total RNA was extracted for virus quantification from all treatment groups using a modification of the Trizol (GIBCO, Life Technologies) and RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) methods, as previously described [32,33].

Lower concentrations, i.e., between 1 and 30 mM, had no toxic effect even when left on the cells until the end of the experiments. When the NH4Cl media was replaced by maintenance media (L15 plus 2.5% FBS) after 7 h of NH4Cl treatment had no toxic effect on the cells for high concentrations (\u226550 mM NH4Cl). Hence, a concentration of 30 mM was selected to test the effect of NH4Cl on TiLV replication, which was replaced with maintenance media after NH4Cl treatment. The choice of 30 mM was in the range of NH4Cl concentration used in several previous studies [34,35,36]. Therefore, in the pre-treatment group, NH4Cl-containing media was added 30 min before virus adsorption, NH4Cl treatment was performed during virus adsorption in the group designated as 0 hpi, and NH4Cl media was added after 1, 2, and 3 hpi and was later replaced with maintenance media in the post-infection groups. The cytopathic effects (CPE) seen at 3 days post-infection (dpi) included the formation of vacuoles (patches) of detached cells from E-11 monolayers infected with TiLV (Figure S5A\u2013H).

The influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) agglutinated avian and piscine RBCs, while ISAV only agglutinated Atlantic salmon and tilapia RBCs. The agglutination of tilapia RBCs by ISAV observed in this study was weak. The inability of TiLV to agglutinate RBCs from any of the species included suggests an absence of surface proteins able to agglutinate RBCs. A lack of an observed effect of lysosomotropic agents indicates an acidification-independent uptake mechanism, although additional studies should be carried out to understand the details of the mechanisms involved.",

            "text": "Different orthomyxoviruses bind to different Sia receptors on host cells. In human influenza A and B viruses, the HA1 subunit binds to Sia receptors attached to either \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6 linkages [19,21], avian and equine influenza viruses bind Sia containing the \u03b12-3 linkage [17], and swine influenza viruses bind Sia attached to the \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 linkages [37,38]. Erythrocytes from several species, such as chicken, turkey, equine, guinea pigs, and humans, possess both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 linkages [22]. Hence, it is likely that the influenza virus strain PR8 used here binds \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 linkages on RBCs found in different host species, including avian and piscine species. Paramyxoviruses, such as the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), share the Neu5,9Ac2 antigenic determinant with orthomyxoviruses [39]. Other viruses that use the Neu5,9Ac2 receptor include coronaviruses. This receptor has been reported in various species, such as humans, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, horses, chicken, turkey, goose, salmonids, crucian carp, mollusks, and sea urchins [40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. Unlike influenza C, ISAV specifically binds Neu4,5Ac2 glycans on host cells using its hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. This HE is unique when compared with the HA or hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) proteins of other orthomyxoviruses, where the sequence identity is very low (<10%). The ISAV HE sequences shares sequence similarity with non-orthomyxoviruses, such as toroviruses and coronaviruses, by <25% [51,52,53]. It is this high specificity of the ISAV HE protein for Neu4,5Ac2 glycans which make it different from other orthomyxoviruses, and may be what accounts for ISAV having lower tropism and mostly binding to fish RBCs, unlike other orthomyxoviruses which bind a wide range of RBCs from different avian, mammalian, and piscine species.",

            "text": "Given that the HA and HE proteins that bind RBCs in hemagglutination assays also serve as ligands that bind Sia receptors used for virus entry into host cells, the inability of TiLV to bind RBCs suggests that it uses mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses for entry into and replication within host cells. This observation is supported by our findings regarding the NH4Cl treatment of E-11 cells infected by TiLV. Studies into cell attachment and replication mechanisms of orthomyxoviruses showed that after HA binding to Sia receptors on host cells, the virus is taken up into endosomal compartments by endocytosis. The low endosomal pH mediates the fusion of viral envelopes with endosomal membranes to facilitate virus uncoating, leading to release of nucleoproteins required for virus replication by acid-dependent cellular proteases. The pH dependence of viral uncoating has been completely paralleled with the fusion of viral envelopes with endosomal membranes [35]. As such, raising the endosomal or lysosomal pH by adding weak lysosomotropic bases like chloroquine and NH4Cl has been shown to prevent virus uncoating, thereby blocking virus replication [35,54]. This phenomenon is supported by several studies [55,56,57,58,59] including Matlin et al. [60], who showed that NH4Cl treatment of Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was able to block the uncoating of the influenza virus in endosomal compartments, leading to replication failure and culminating in the prevention of infection. Other viruses where replication was shown to be inhibited by NH4Cl treatment include alphaviruses [55], herpes simplex virus type 1 [56], reoviruses [57], and coronaviruses [58,59]. In the present study, NH4Cl treatment neither inhibited nor enhanced TiLV replication in E-11 cells, as there was no difference in virus replication in NH4Cl-treated or -nontreated cells.",
