More importantly, EV71-infected children can develop neurological complications, such as aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, encephalitis, acute cerebellar ataxia, brainstem encephalitis, as well as fatal pulmonary edema or cardiopulmonary collapse [1]. Currently, EV71 is recognized as the most clinically important neurotropic virus since poliovirus has been nearly eradicated in the majority of countries around the world [2]. Significant morbidities and mortalities associated with increasingly frequent HFMD outbreaks throughout the Asia-Pacific region have raised public concerns [3-6]. Despite improvements in virological and medical research, treatments for acute EV71 infections are mainly aimed towards alleviating clinical symptoms, and there is still no specific antiviral agent available against EV71.",

Identifying the appropriate chemical modifications will be essential to resolving these hurdles and bringing RNAi to the clinic [16]. The properties of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be optimized by incorporation of chemically modified RNA analogues to increase nuclease resistance, improve target specificity and maintain gene-silencing activity [16]. Importantly, the high efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs can be accompanied by low cell toxicity [17]. Recent studies have successfully improved siRNA performance by incorporation of chemically modified RNA analogues against virus infection [18-22]. Among these, 2\u2019-O-methylation (2\u2019-OMe) and 2\u2019-fluoro (2\u2019-F) are classic patterns of chemical modification.",

            "text": "The selection of appropriate siRNA targets is a critical initial step in the development of antiviral RNAi therapeutics. Successful siRNA designs must be based on the conserved sequences of the viral genome. EV71 is a small, non-enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. Like all picornavirus, EV71 genome possesses a conserved 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of approximately 740 nucleotides (nt) [23,24]. The 5\u2032 UTR of EV71 is involved in key steps of the viral life cycle, including replication and translation [25,26]. Due to its high degree of conservation which renders it less likely to mutate and functional importance for viral replication, the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome is an attractive target region for siRNA therapeutic treatment. In both cell cultures and animal experiments, RNAi in the form of chemically synthesized siRNA or plasmid-derived shRNA has been used to effectively inhibit EV71 infection, revealing several potential target sequences within the 3\u2032 UTR, VP1, 3D, 3C, and 2C regions of the EV71 genome [27-31]. However, the higher order structure of the EV71 genomic 5\u2032 UTR makes targeting of this region especially challenging. To date, no effective siRNAs targeting the conserved 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome have been reported.",

Identification of effective target sequences within the highly conserved 5\u2032 UTR and optimization of siRNA properties by 2\u2032-OMe or 2\u2032-F modification for future in vivo applications were considered primary objectives. Direct in vitro evaluation explored the effectiveness of siRNAs targeting the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome in inhibiting viral replication. Meanwhile, we observed good compatibility of the introduction of appropriate 2\u2032-OMe or 2\u2032-F modifications into the siRNA duplexes, which maintained high antiviral activities. Enhanced serum stability was confirmed as a major advantage of the 2\u2032-modified siRNAs in comparison with unmodified counterparts.

The nucleotide identities between siRNA targeting sequences in HM003207.1 and corresponding sequences in other EV71 China strains available in GenBank were also considered by using the cluster alignment function of the DNAStar (DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) software. Specifically identified sequences were subjected to analysis by the BLAST algorithm (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) to exclude homology in both human and mouse genomes. Unmodified siRNAs targeting the 115\u2013133 nt sequence and the 648\u2013666 nt sequence of 5\u2032 UTR that satisfied the above criteria were designated as si-1 and si-2. Subsequently, si-1 and si-2 were chemically modified by 2\u2032-OMe or 2\u2032-F at U and C sequences on complementary strands. The 2\u2032-modified siRNAs were designated as si-1OMe, si-1 F, si-2OMe, and si-2 F. A scrambled sequence with the same base composition as si-2 and no sequence homology to the viral genome was designed as a negative control. In addition, FAM-labeled si-2 was synthesized with the label on the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand, designated as si-2FAM. The siRNA sequences are listed in Table 1.

The efficiencies of the various siRNAs in inhibiting EV71 replication were analyzed using the real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assay. Results showed that there were significant reductions in EV71 RNA transcripts in a dosage-dependent manner when the infected RD cells were treated with the unmodified (si-1, si-2) and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs (si-1 F, si-2OMe, or si-2 F) after EV71 infection (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

Transfection of RD cells with unmodified (si-1, si-2) and 2\u2032-modified (si-1 F, si-2OMe, or si-2 F) siRNAs effectively deceased progeny virus yield, resulting in significant reductions in plaque formation in RD cell monolayers compared with those of the mock transfection control (Figure 6A).

            "text": "For many years, there has been an ongoing search for effective vaccines or antiviral agents for the treatment of EV71 infections. Previous studies have shown that EV71 for its survival and replication developed a defense mechanism that could not only eliminate the innate interferon immune response but also weaken the effect of exogenous interferon treatment. The 3C protein of EV71 inhibits retinoid acid-inducible gene I-mediated interferon regulatory factor 3 activation and type I interferon responses [33]. EV71 suppresses Toll-like receptor 3-mediated type I interferon responses by down-regulation of Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing beta interferon (TRIF) [34]. EV71 also antagonizes type I interferon signaling by reducing the level of interferon receptor 1 [35]. Traditional interferon therapy, which has been successfully applied to many viruses, showed only weak anti-EV71 activities and is not suitable for the treatment of EV71 infections [35,36]. Given the limitations of current therapies for EV71 infections, our attention was drawn to the developing RNAi research field. In this study, unmodified and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs were designed to target the highly conserved 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome to inhibit EV71 infection in vitro. When compared with EV71 China strain genomes available in GenBank in the previous 5 years, siRNAs targeting the 115\u2013133 nt sequence of the EV71 genomic 5\u2032 UTR indicated the rates of sequences with complete nucleotide coincidence reached about 71.30%, while the siRNAs targeting the 648\u2013666 nt sequence of the EV71 genomic 5\u2032 UTR showed the rates of sequences with complete nucleotide coincidence (37.04%) and those with the same single-nucleotide difference (41.66%) together reached about 79.70% (Additional file 2: Table S1). Thus, siRNA nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that a mixture of the siRNAs (including consideration of the same single-nucleotide mismatch of target sequences to design a pair of siRNAs) targeting these two regions above may have much broader antiviral effect on diverse EV71 China strains.",

The inhibitory effects against EV71 replication were sequence-specific and dosage-dependent, resulting in significant decreases in viral RNA, VP1 protein and viral titer. The most effective inhibition was observed for the siRNAs (si-2, si-2OMe, and si-2 F) targeting the 648\u2013666 nt sequence of the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome, followed by the siRNAs (si-1 and si-1 F) targeting the 115\u2013133 nt sequence of the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome. It is likely that variations in efficiency are primarily due to differences in positional accessibility of respective target sequences. The current research demonstrates that the highly conserved 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome can be targeted for inhibition of EV71 replication by efficient siRNAs. The results were consistent with previous studies of siRNAs targeting the 5\u2032 UTR of other RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus [37,38] and coxsackievirus B3 [20]. These studies demonstrated that siRNAs targeting the 5' UTR of the viral genome can exert significant antiviral activity. However, siRNAs targeting the highly conserved 5\u2032 UTR of the poliovirus genome failed to inhibit virus replication [39]. It is possible that some siRNAs cannot efficiently hybridize to target sequences of the viral 5\u2032 UTR due to complex secondary structure or protein interactions with RNA motifs that may occlude the target sequences. Thus, the secondary structure of target RNA is an important factor in selecting a suitable target sequence, as it can have a negative effect on RNAi efficiency [40,41].",

Synthesized siRNAs used to mediate RNAi against EV71 may be a good strategy for genetic antiviral therapy as it is straightforward and amenable to chemical modification. The 2\u2032-OMe and 2\u2032-F chemical modifications are classic patterns that can increase binding affinity, nuclease stability and be well-tolerated throughout the duplex [16]. These advantages are important for therapeutic applications. To optimize the properties of siRNAs for further research and clinical applications, 2\u2032-OMe or 2\u2032-F modification at U and C sequences on siRNA complementary strands were employed in this study. We compared the serum stabilities as well as gene silencing and cytotoxic effects of the unmodified siRNAs and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs.",

In this study, the RNAi activities of 2\u2032-modified siRNAs were evaluated. It was found that 2\u2032-modified si-1 F, si-2OMe and si-2 F manifested similar RNAi activity in comparison with unmodified counterparts. The cells transfected with si-2OMe and si-2 F targeting the sequence of nt 648\u2013666 within the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome had better RNAi activity than si-1 F targeting the sequence of nt 115\u2013133 within the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome. The results indicated that the RNAi activity of 2\u2032-modified siRNAs can be determined based on the primary sequence of the siRNAs. It is worth noting that the 2\u2032-modified si-1OMe showed significantly decrease in antivirus activity compared with unmodified counterparts. It is not clear why the patterns of 2\u2032-OMe modifications work for one sequence but not for another. Perhaps the introduction of 2\u2032-OMe modifications into the si-1 alters the thermostability of the duplex that could interfere with the activity of siRNA. The results also indicated that siRNA modifications are typically sequence dependent, requiring optimization of the modification strategy for each different siRNA sequence when screening for efficient chemically modified siRNAs.",
