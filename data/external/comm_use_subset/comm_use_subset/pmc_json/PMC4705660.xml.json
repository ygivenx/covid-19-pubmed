            "text": "Reading-frame maintenance is crucial for translational fidelity because it ensures that codons are in the correct reading-frame of an mRNA on delivery into the A site of an elongating ribosome. However, functional translational frameshifting is programmed site-specifically into particular mRNA of a variety of mobile elements as well as viruses and a few cellular genes (1\u20137). Specifically programmed sequences and structures in mRNA can cause a fraction of elongating ribosomes to shift 1 nt in the 5\u2032-direction of mRNA, leading to a \u22121 programmed reading-frame shift (PRF), whereas a +1 frameshifting occurs when the ribosome slips toward the 3\u2032-direction by 1 nt (8). In addition to the in-frame translation products, frameshifting events thus allow the synthesis of an extra protein with its N-terminal and C-terminal regions (separated by the shifting site) encoded by the 0-frame and the shifted frames, respectively. Many viruses require \u22121 frameshifting in their decoding of crucial viral genes and rely on \u22121 PRF efficiency to control the ratio between viral proteins for optimal viral propagation.",

            "text": "Efficient eukaryotic \u22121 PRF requires two cis-acting elements in mRNA, a slippery sequence (where frameshifting occurs) and an optimally placed downstream stimulator structure. An X_XXY_YYZ sequence in the slippery site facilitates \u22121 frameshifting by paving codon-anticodon disruption in the P and A sites of the 0-frame (XXY and YYZ codons) and codon-anticodon repairing in the \u22121 frame (XXX and YYY codons). This transition is further enhanced by resistance from the downstream stimulator (usually a pseudoknot or a hairpin) to the duplex unwinding activity of ribosome, leading to interference in the translocation step of an elongation cycle (9\u201313). Additionally, the spacing nucleotide number between the slippery site and downstream stimulator affects \u22121 PRF efficiency because it helps positioning the slippery site in the A and P sites of an elongating ribosome while the downstream stimulator approaches the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome (14). It has been proposed that tension is created between the unwinding stimulator and the codon-anticodon interaction network anchored around the ribosomal P and A sites, and the shift to \u22121 frame relieves the tension and overcomes the ribosomal pause imposed by the stimulator (14\u201316). Interestingly, base-pairing interaction between an internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD)-like sequence upstream of the frameshifting site and anti-SD sequence in 16S ribosomal RNA also acts as a frameshifting regulator in 70S ribosome (17,18). This could be due to the tension or a translation pause mediated by the upstream SD\u00b7anti-SD mediated duplex (19).",

Given the crucial role of \u22121 PRF for efficient viral replication, different strategies have been developed to target viral \u22121 PRF stimulators to explore potential antiviral applications. Small ligands capable of interfering with viral \u22121 PRF activity by binding with the downstream \u22121 PRF stimulators of HIV and SARS-CoV have been identified either by screening or structure-based design (23\u201325). Alternatively, antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) targeting the viral \u22121 PRF stimulator pseudoknot has been shown to impair the replication of an SARS-CoV replicon (26). For both approaches, the functional characterization of a viral \u22121 PRF stimulator is required and this may represent a bottle-neck in combating emerging epidemic viral pathogens such as the MERS-CoV (27).",

            "text": "Recently, an RNA hairpin upstream of the \u22121 frameshifting site of the SARS-CoV has been shown to attenuate \u22121 PRF depending on hairpin stability and an optimal spacer length between the slippery site and hairpin (28,29). This unique upstream hairpin represents the first cis-element capable of downregulating eukaryotic \u22121 PRF activity and understanding its functional mechanism should provide insight into the mechanism of \u22121 PRF regulation with antiviral application potential. As the upstream attenuation hairpin is unwound by the ribosome before the ribosome encounters the downstream stimulator, it has been proposed that the refolding dynamics of the hairpin is responsible for its \u22121 PRF attenuating activity (29). Here, we found that an RNA\u2013DNA duplex formed by annealing antisense DNA to its complementary mRNA sequence upstream of a \u22121 PRF slippery site could attenuate \u22121 PRF to a similar extent as that of an upstream hairpin attenuator. That the cis-formed upstream hairpin can be replaced by a trans-formed duplex suggests upstream duplex formation is the determining element in \u22121 PRF attenuation. This finding is reminiscent of frameshifting regulation by SD\u00b7anti-SD mediated short upstream duplex in 70S ribosome (17,18), providing insight on the functional mechanisms of upstream \u22121 PRF attenuation in 80S ribosome. Furthermore, we apply this upstream duplex attenuator to counteract several viral \u22121 PRF signals to demonstrate its general application potential as an alternative \u22121 PRF inhibition approach. Thus, inhibiting \u22121 PRF by antisense-mediated upstream duplex provides a potentially quick antiviral solution to the emerging highly pathogenic coronaviruses and an opportunity to sequence-specifically regulate \u22121 PRF related cellular events.",

Aiming for sequence-specific regulation of \u22121 PRF, we designed DNA oligonucleotides complementary to the 5\u2032-half (6BPGC-5\u2032-DNA) or the 3\u2032-half (6BPGC-3\u2032-DNA) sequences of the stem of a potent \u22121 PRF attenuator hairpin (6BPGC) (29) (Supplementary Figure S1A) to interfere with attenuation hairpin refolding. Each antisense DNA was designed to form either 19 or 20 bp with its complementary upstream RNA target to generate RNA\u2013DNA duplexes of similar stability (37). We then measured the effect of each antisense on attenuation efficiency of a \u22121 PRF reporter (6BPGC-SARSPK) containing the upstream 6BPGC attenuator hairpin and a downstream SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF pseudoknot stimulator (30). The \u22121 PRF attenuation was tracked by decreased \u22121 PRF efficiency, which was observed from decreased \u22121 frame or/and increased 0 frame translation products upon antisense addition in a \u22121 PRF assay. Interestingly, addition of 6BPGC-5\u2032-DNA resulted in a dose-dependent loss of 6BPGC attenuator activity consistent with antisense-mediated attenuation hairpin disruption, whereas addition of 6BPGC-3\u2032-DNA did not suppress attenuator activity of 6BPGC (Figure 1A and B). This means that \u22121 PRF activity can be oppositely controlled in-trans by antisense DNA oligonucleotides designed to target either side of the stem region of an upstream attenuator hairpin, providing a way to sequence-specifically regulate \u22121 PRF.",

Alternatively, the opposite effects may have been caused by the difference in spacing from the slippery site between the two antisense-mediated RNA\u2013DNA duplexes, given that proximity plays an important role in the attenuation efficiency of a cis-formed attenuator hairpin (29). Consistent with the later explanation, addition of an antisense DNA (restore DNA), with sequences complementary to the 3\u2032-stem of an impaired attenuator hairpin (6BPGC5\u2032WT) (Supplementary Figure S1B), led to enhanced attenuation of \u22121 PRF efficiency of a reporter (6BPGC5\u2032WT-SARSPK1) containing 6BPGC5\u2032- WT in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C and D). As the impaired attenuator hairpin shares the same 3\u2032-stem sequences to those of 6BPGC, this result also rules out the accessibility issue. Thus, these findings indicate that an upstream duplex needs to be proximal to the slippery site for efficient \u22121 PRF attenuation and suggest that the duplex in a proximal upstream hairpin stem is the functional unit responsible for \u22121 frameshifting attenuation.",

The \u22121 PRF attenuation activity of the shortest upstream duplex declined dramatically while being compared with that of the longest upstream duplex (both mediated by 10 \u03bcM of antisenses) (Figure 2A and B). Although the proximity requirement of a functional upstream \u22121 PRF attenuation duplex in Figure 1A and B suggests that the observed \u22121 PRF attenuation is not the result of ribosomal drop-off during translational elongation of a ribosome, the loss of observed \u22121 PRF attenuation activity by a shorter upstream duplex in Figure 2A and B implies that the observed \u2018\u22121 PRF attenuation\u2019 by restore DNA23 could have been caused by drop-off effect mediated by the longer upstream duplex (39). In particular, the gel based assay may not resolve the potential upstream duplex-mediated drop-off product from the 0-frame translation product. Eventually, this could result in the amount of 0-frame product being overestimated, leading to underestimation of \u22121 PRF efficiency. To address this issue, we created a new construct (6BPGC5\u2032WT-SARSPK2) with the 0-frame stop codon being moved further downstream of the slippery site (Supplementary Figure S1D) to help distinguishing 0-frame products from the potential drop-off products that should appear within upstream mRNA sequences targeted by the antisenses. The trend in \u22121 PRF attenuation efficiency for upstream duplexes of different lengths using the 6BPGC5\u2032WT-SARSPK2 construct is similar to that of the one used in Figure 2B in the presence of 10 \u03bcM of antisenses (Figure 2C and D), indicating upstream duplexes of sufficient length do act as a \u22121 PRF attenuator. We noted that the attenuation efficiencies of antisense-mediated upstream duplexes in Figures 1 and 2 were not dramatic (but statistically significant) in the presence of 1 and 10 \u03bcM of antisenses because they were calculated from constructs carrying 6BPGC5\u2032WT hairpin that possesses residual \u22121 PRF attenuation activity. Nevertheless, these results confirm that the \u22121 PRF attenuation effect can be generated in-trans by an antisense DNA-mediated upstream duplex proximal to the slippery site.",

To see if the upstream duplex can be used to attenuate viral \u22121 PRF stimulators other than that of SARS-CoV, we compared the frameshifting efficiencies of several viral \u22121 PRF pseudoknot stimulators, including mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), simian retrovirus (SRV) and a hairpin stimulator derived from SRV pseudoknot (40\u201342) (Supplementary Figure S2), in the presence of different amount of antisense targeting upstream sequences (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Surprisingly, we found that significant \u22121 PRF attenuation was observed in the presence of 1 \u03bcM of antisenses by comparing with those in Figures 1 and 2. It could be explained by the less stable structures formed upstream of the slippery sites in the current reporters. By contrast, the amount of \u22121 frame product translated from a read-through control (p2luci) was not affected. Furthermore, the \u22121 PRF activities can be attenuated to different extents by designed antisense DNA of different complementarities to the sequences upstream of the slippery site. For example, 10 \u03bcM of restore DNA23 was needed to attenuate \u22121PRF to similar extent as that of 0.1 \u03bcM of SRV 5\u2032 as (Figure 3E and F) because restore DNA23 forms less base pairs with the upstream sequences. Taken together, these results indicate that the upstream duplex approach provides a general means of downregulating \u22121 PRF activity stimulated by distinct types of downstream stimulators in vitro.",

However, the \u22121 PRF activity of a shortened p2luc reporter containing the 229E upstream hairpin and an SARS-CoV pseudoknot was not attenuated as efficiently as that by the SARS-CoV attenuator hairpin (Supplementary Figure S4A\u2013C), and could be explained by the less stable free energy of the 229E upstream hairpin predicted by Mfold (43). We then asked if an antisense-mediated duplex can compete with the predicted 229E upstream hairpin to generate a potent \u22121 PRF attenuator in a duplex form. EMSA experiments indicated an isolated 229E upstream RNA hairpin (Supplementary Figure S4D) forming a complex with an antisense DNA (anti-229E) that targets the 3\u2032-side sequences of the hairpin (Supplementary Figure S4E), suggesting the formation of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the addition of anti-229E led to higher \u22121 PRF attenuation activity than the cis-formed 229E viral attenuator hairpin alone in a full-length p2luc-based \u22121 PRF reporter (Supplementary Figure S4E and S4B). Thus, pre-existing local conformations upstream of \u22121 PRF slippery site can be programmed by the antisense approach to generate a functional \u22121 PRF attenuator in the form of a trans-formed duplex.",

However, the success of this approach requires characterization of the boundary of the downstream stimulator. Such information may not be available for a new outbreak pathogen, such as the MERS-CoV (27). Indeed, we found that both a SARS-CoV type 3-stems pseudoknot (28,44\u201346) and a 229E type kissing hairpin pseudoknot (47) might exist downstream of the UUUAAAC \u22121 PRF slippery site of the MERS-CoV (48) (Supplementary Figure S5A and B). Additionally, two \u22121 PRF reporters containing sequence deletions of MERS-CoV \u22121 PRF signal that block the formation of either pseudoknot (Supplementary Figure S6) possessed substantial \u22121 PRF activity both in vitro and in 293T cell (Figure 5 A\u2013D), suggesting that both pseudoknots may function during viral replication although the contribution of either pseudoknot to viral \u22121 PRF activity requires further study. 2\u2032 OMe-modified RNA was used to evaluate the viral \u22121 PRF attenuation activity of the antisense-mediated upstream duplex in human cell lysate because DNA antisense would be digested in crude cellular lysates. We found that a 2\u2032 OMe-modified antisense RNA oligonucleotide capable of mediating upstream duplex formation (Supplementary Figure S6A) efficiently downregulated the in vitro \u22121 PRF activities of the MERS-CoV viral sequence capable of forming alternative downstream stimulators in a dosage-dependent manner in human 293T cell lysate, whereas the attenuation effect was neutralized by the co-existence of an anti-antisense (Supplementary Figure S6A and Figure 6A). A more rigorous statistical analysis recommended for p2-luc based assay (36) using 10 \u03bcM of 2\u2032 OMe-modified antisense RNA and a read-through control led to a similar extent of inhibition (Figure 6B). Therefore, targeting the sequence upstream of the slippery site represents an efficient and straightforward approach to viral \u22121 PRF inhibition because detailed knowledge of the downstream stimulator boundary is not required. This approach should be useful in looking for quick therapeutic solutions to emerging pathogens such as the MERS-CoV.",

Accordingly, a frameshifting pseudoknot can prohibit a significant fraction of frameshifted ribosomes that it stimulated from reaching the \u22121 frame stop codon. Eventually, it leads to the compromise of observed \u22121 PRF efficiency (49). By contrast, the trans-formed \u22121 PRF attenuator duplex identified in this work is upstream of the slippery site and the potential ribosomal drop-off effect mediated by the duplex should occur before the ribosome reaches the slippery site. While the drop-off effect could lead to under-estimation of \u22121 PRF efficiency if the drop-off products could not be distinguished from the 0-frame products, the observations from experimental design that moves the 0-frame stop codon away from the location of upstream duplex (in Figure 2C and D) clearly clarified the role of upstream duplexes in \u22121 PRF attenuation. Furthermore, both a cis-formed upstream hairpin (29) and a trans-formed duplex (this work) can act to attenuate \u22121 PRF stimulated by a variety of downstream stimulators in 80S ribosome systems, suggesting both attenuators could share the same \u22121 PRF attenuation mechanism.",

            "text": "Previously, a ribosomal E site adjacent duplex formed between an internal SD-like element upstream of the slippery site and the anti-SD sequence of 16S rRNA was shown to attenuate prokaryotic \u22121 frameshifting efficiency in E. coli (18). By contrast, internal SD can promote release factor 2 (RF2)-dependent +1 frameshifting when placed adjacent to the ribosomal E site (20). Such an opposite role in \u22121 and +1 frameshifting regulation led to the suggestion of a tension-mediated mechanism in frameshifting stimulation (19). Alternatively, such effects could be caused by the elongation pausing mediated by an internal SD\u00b7anti-SD interaction during the elongation of 70S ribosome (50). Interestingly, we have previously shown that an upstream hairpin can stimulate +1 frameshifting in yeast in addition to attenuating \u22121 PRF in an in vitro 80S translation system (29). The mechanism of in-cis refolding hairpin as well as trans-formed upstream duplex in eukaryotic frameshifting regulation may thus be relevant to that of the duplex formed between internal SD and 16S rRNA in prokaryotic frameshifting regulation, given that formation of a duplex upstream of the slippery site is involved in all these cases. However, moving the attenuator hairpin 5\u2032 further (29) did not enhance \u22121 PRF efficiency in the same manner as SD-like stimulator element did (18). A possible reason for this difference is that the internal SD-mediated duplex involves the 16S ribosomal RNA component of 70S ribosome and is part of the translational machinery, whereas the eukaryotic ribosome lacks an anti-SD sequence. Due to such a difference between 70S and 80S translation systems, the antisense-mediated upstream duplex identified in this work could simply act as a wheel chock to block \u22121 ribosome movement triggered by downstream \u22121 PRF stimulator mediated tension effect (14\u201316).",

Ongoing works will test if a trans-formed upstream duplex can replace the functionality of an internal SD\u00b7anti-SD interaction in the 70S ribosome for frameshifting regulation aimed for establishing a link between 70S and 80S ribosome in frameshifting regulation via upstream duplexes of different forms. The effects triggered by downstream stimulators during translocation cycle (51\u201353) could then be examined in the presence of an upstream duplex to help illustrating the mechanisms of both stimulation and attenuation.",
