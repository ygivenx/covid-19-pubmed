However, when measured the quality and volume of health research data that has been shared, even when related to public health emergencies, remains low\n1,\n2. There are a number of ethical, legal and technical issues that act as impediments to sharing data but it seems this lack of progress is more a consequence of a cultural reluctance among researchers to \u2018give up their data\u2019 unless there are clear benefits returning to them. This reluctance is heightened among researchers in low resource settings who feel that the requirements to share data, from funders and journals, risk turning them into data exporters unless greater efforts are made to ensure a fairer distribution of benefits. In this paper the authors draw on their experience working for Wellcome Trust and TDR - the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases - of supporting data sharing initiatives and combine that with commissioned research to highlight the barriers to sharing research data and the role research funders might play to improve this situation.",

The detailed search workflow, a spreadsheet recording the results, and a bibliography of all papers deemed in scope are published\n1,\n2. The year 2003 was chosen as the start date for the review as this was the year of the last major SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak.

Funders should ensure better monitoring of the implementation of their policies and where such evidence exists that shared data added value this should be documented and disseminated. The overall purpose of sharing the data needs to be clear and ideally developed with input from data suppliers, secondary data users, potential end-users and beneficiaries, and if possible with input from the participants that are the source of those data.
