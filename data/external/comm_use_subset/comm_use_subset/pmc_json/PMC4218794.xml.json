In human and animal models of seasonal influenza, influenza virus A/H5N1 (Avian Influenza A H5N1 virus) and A/H1N1/1918 (Influenza A H1N1 1918 strain) the cytokine levels in host respiratory secretions and serum have been associated with disease severity and outcome [3]. Hypercytokinemia was observed in humans infected with influenza virus A/H5N1 and found to be correlated to severity and mortality [4]. The innate immune responses in humans infected with influenza virus A/H5N1 suggest that pro-inflammatory mediators are contributing to disease pathogenesis, with elevated blood levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and sIL-2R and elevated levels of IP-10, MCP-1, and MIG observed in patients [5]. Such responses may contribute to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure observed in many patients. Recently, IFITM3, an interferon-induced transmembrane protein, has been shown to have important roles in restricting the morbidity and mortality in mice infected with influenza virus [6].",

The study took place across five hospitals in Vietnam, three hospitals in Indonesia, four hospitals in Thailand, and one in Singapore, all hospitals being part of the Southeast Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network (SEAICRN). The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of subjects with no detectable viral RNA in respiratory swabs at day 5 as measured by RT-PCR. Whole-blood samples were collected in PAXgene tubes on day 0, 5 and 28 of enrolment into the study. For this study, to avoid the effect of the treatment on the host response, only the whole blood samples collected before oseltamivir treatment (study day 0) and at follow up (day 28) were used.",

The interferon response was shown to be strongly up-regulated in influenza virus A infection [11], however, the exact mechanism of interferon responses in different clinical severities of influenza has not been described. Here, we found that the interferon signaling pathway and the protein ubiquitination pathway were attenuated in patients with fever of unknown aetiology and patients with severe influenza manifestations suggesting the protective roles of these pathways in the disease mechanism. Furthermore, our data suggests that interferon signaling pathway and other interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) play important protective roles in the disease mechanism. Amongst the IFITMs, IFITM3 has been shown to block influenza virus entry to the cells [12] and limit the severity of influenza virus infection in mice [13]. Our data suggests that not only IFITM3, but other IFITMs and ISGs genes could similarly play important roles in the disease outcomes.",

            "text": "Apart from the interferon pathway, the ubiquitiniation signaling pathway was also attenuated in patients with severe outcome. Protein ubiquitination is a post-translational process involving the addition of ubiquitin to a protein substrate, and it plays important roles in protein-protein interactions. For example the NS1 protein from influenza A virus could inhibit the IFN response by inhibiting the ubiquitination of the viral RNA sensor RIG-I [14]. RIG-I is the key host sensor for viral RNA inside the cytoplasm that accounts for the induction of the host IFN response [15]. Ubiquitination of the CARD domain in RIG-I is essential for the activation of IRF3 and NFkB which in turn induce the IFN production [16]\n[17]. As mentioned above, ubiquitination of RIG-I is the key process by which the host could recognize the influenza virus RNA to induce interferon response. The attenuation of the protein ubiquitination pathway and RIG-I could lead to the lack of interferon response in the severe patients. It was also shown that the host protein ubiquitination system is required for influenza virus replication [17]. This may explain why the percentage of patients who had virus detected at sample collection was lower in the severe group (55%) in comparison with those in the moderate group (86%).",

It was shown in mouse model that MMP9, which is capable of digesting the extracellular matrix, was produced mainly by neutrophils and was required for neutrophils migration to the respiratory tract in response against viral replication [18]. The up-regulation of MMP9 in the severe patients suggests the contribution of this gene in the disease outcome. The up-regulation of the Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) gene was IFNAR1-dependent and it has negative regulatory functions to the innate immune response which could inhibit type I interferon signaling [19]. The lack of interferon signaling in the severe patients could be explained by the up-regulation of SOCS3 in these patients. TLR10 has recently been shown to play a role in innate immune response in influenza infection and that its expression is stronger during infection by the highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus [20].",

Previous studies have shown that severe influenza A disease was associated with a transient NK cell and CD8 T cell response [22], [23]. Amongst the down-regulated genes, NCR3 has been reported to show a direct interaction with influenza viruses whereby the virus down-regulates the cytotoxicity of NK cells mediated by this gene [24], [25]. In addition, single polymorphisms in NCR3 have been shown to be strongly associated with decreased lung function in a recently conducted large scale (N>48,000) genome-wide association study of forced expiratory volume as a surrogate for lung function [26].",

Nevertheless, we have generated a large exploratory transcriptomic dataset in influenza disease with a wide spectrum of severity. Although the validation of these findings is beyond the scale of the current study, our dataset can serve as a valuable data mine for researchers in the field to select their own gene candidates for hypothesis testing and validation. Taken together, by investigating the global host transcriptional profile in influenza virus A infected patients with different clinical outcomes, we have provided insights into the global gene expression in influenza virus A infection. In particular, we have revealed the attenuation of interferon and protein ubiquitination pathways and the down-regulation of T and NK cell related responses in patients with severe influenza virus A infections. Lastly, we propose the following candidate genes for further studies: MMP9, SOCS3, IFITMs, TLR10, RIG-I, CD244 and NCR3.",
