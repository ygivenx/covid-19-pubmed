When evaluating vaccine response, however, it is important to also consider racial background. For example, among a racially diverse, healthy elderly population in the USA, a reduced response to influenza vaccine was observed among elderly African Americans, compared with elderly Caucasian and Latinos [16]. Furthermore, racial differences in relation to vaccination have been observed in Taiwan among Han Chinese children compared with Aboriginal children; higher titres against hepatitis B vaccination were reported for Han Chinese children [17].",

Influenza vaccination prevented approximately 69% of influenza-related hospitalisation admissions in Hong Kong during the 2003\u20132004 winter season [19] and was strongly associated with a reduction in pneumonia, heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus and renal disease in Taiwan in 2001 [20]. Vaccine effectiveness, however, has also been reported to be lower in elderly Chinese people than in adult Chinese people (68.6% versus 74%, respectively) [18]. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, coverage rates are low in China; for example, the general vaccination rate among the urban population of Beijing is only 10.5%, falling to 7.9% for those \u2265 60 years of age [21]. Thus, because currently available vaccines do not offer optimal protection in the elderly [14,15] and vaccine coverage rates are low [21], elderly Chinese people are at increased risk of influenza and its related complications. As China has the world's largest population of elderly people (>80 million) [22], influenza represents a considerable health and economic burden.",

Although the number and incidence of some of the solicited local reactions in the Sub/MF59\u2122 vaccine group was greater than in the Subunit group, they were generally mild or moderate and of short duration, and no subjects withdrew from the study due to safety concerns. Furthermore, the incidence of injection-site pain reported here was lower than has been reported in other studies [25,27]. Although the incidence of fever was higher than has been reported previously with MF59\u2122-adjuvanted influenza vaccination [25,27], the increased incidence was evident for both vaccines used in this study, rather than for the Sub/MF59\u2122 vaccine only. The increase does not appear to be due to race, as in a previous study in elderly Chinese subjects [19] the incidence of fever was 0% following vaccination with non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. These findings are in agreement with the published results of clinical trials conducted in elderly Caucasian populations in Europe [25]. These trials supported registration of the vaccine in Europe, and concluded that the addition of MF59\u2122 to subunit influenza vaccines does not cause clinically important changes in the safety profile of the influenza vaccine. To date, more than 30 million doses of the MF59\u2122-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine have been sold, and it has demonstrated a good safety profile [32]. Evaluation of post-marketing pharmacovigilance case reports (n = 385; September 1997 to April 2006) confirmed that vaccination with the MF59\u2122-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine was associated with a very low frequency of adverse reactions [33].",

Significantly (P < 0.05) higher antibody titres were induced by the Sub/MF59\u2122 vaccine compared with the Subunit vaccine. Furthermore, as for the safety profile, the immunogenicity results agree with the results of trials conducted in Europe [24,25,27]. For all three influenza strains tested, both the MF59\u2122-adjuvanted and the non-adjuvanted vaccine met at least one criterion of the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) criteria for the immunogenicity evaluation of seasonal influenza vaccines, as required for vaccine licensure [34]. For both vaccines, the trend was for higher immunogenicity for the influenza A strains, compared to the B strain. It is of note that very high pre-vaccination titres were recorded in this study, especially for A/H1N1. This could be explained in part by the A/H1N1 vaccine strain (A/New Caledonia/20/99-like H1N1) being included in the vaccine formulation for several influenza seasons previous to the 2005\u20132006 season. Furthermore, from an epidemiological standpoint, influenza A strains are often the most dominant and the most relevant strains among adults and the elderly, with A/H1N1 having been the predominant circulating strain in the Guangxi region of China during the time before the trial was conducted.",

Subjects were randomised (2:1) to receive either Sub/MF59\u2122 (n = 400) or a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine (Subunit; Agrippal\u00ae, Novartis Vaccines; n = 200). Both vaccines included the strains recommended for the 2005\u20132006 Northern hemisphere influenza season. Randomisation was achieved using the PEMS V2.1 statistical software (Statistics Teaching and Research Division, West China University of Medical Sciences; released January 1996). A 0.5 ml dose was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.",
