At least one virus was detected in 52.1% of samples in this study. Influenza virus was the predominant agent, and this finding is consistent with other reports [7]\u2013[9]. Since ILI is a clinical definition designed to detect potential influenza cases, the use of ILI as a case-definition makes influenza viruses the viruses most likely to be identified [9]. This case-definition is suitable for the purpose of HIMM surveillance, which is focused on the detection of influenza. Yu et al. investigated respiratory viral etiology in adults with acute respiratory tract infections visiting an ED in China, and the parainfluenza virus was found to be the dominant agent [12]. In their study, enrollment criteria included respiratory symptoms, a body temperature above 37.5\u00b0C, and a normal or low leukocyte count, but not radiographic abnormalities on chest [12]. There is a difference in the respiratory viral etiology between children and adults. RSV was the most prevalent virus and was associated with substantial morbidity in children with respiratory virus infection [13]\u2013[15]. In this research, the study population included only adult patients, and the viral etiology of pediatric patients with ILI was not evaluated.",

In this study, multiple respiratory viruses were detected in 5.6% of positive specimens and 2.9% of total ILI patient samples. The clinical significance of the co-incidence of respiratory viruses has not been clearly determined. In infants with bronchiolitis, dual viral infection was a risk factor for ICU admission and co-infection with human metapneumovirus and RSV was strongly associated with disease severity [16], [17]. Additionally, viral co-infections were related to an increased probability for hospitalization in children with respiratory infection [14]. However, the impact of detection of multiple respiratory viral infections on clinical outcome has rarely been investigated in adults. In this study, the disease severity or outcome were not different significantly between patients with single virus and patients with multiple respiratory viruses. In addition, the detection of viral nucleic acid in respiratory specimens does not always suggest that it is the causative agent of the apparent infection [18]. Among respiratory viruses, rhinovirus was the most common virus detected in influenza patients. In one patient, six respiratory viruses were detected simultaneously. This 20 years old female patient was previously healthy, and the outcome was good without hospitalization or any complication or sequelae. Among 58 co-incidence cases, two patients were hospitalized (influenza A virus and rhinovirus, influenza A virus and RSV A). Further research on viral interference, especially between influenza virus and rhinovirus, is required in both animal models and humans.",

Third, there is a possibility that a low viral titer could not be detected by RT-PCR. Fourth, patients with acute febrile illness but without respiratory illness could be enrolled in this study because the recruitment depended on whether cases met the established ILI criteria or not. Finally, this study described only the result of laboratory data. However, this study is valuable for understanding the respiratory viral etiology of ILI patients during the 2011\u20132012 season.
