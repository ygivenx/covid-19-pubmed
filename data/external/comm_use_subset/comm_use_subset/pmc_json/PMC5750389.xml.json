This is particularly problematic for RNA viruses because of their high mutation rates, propensity to undergo recombination and/or reassortment, and the establishment of viral quasispecies upon infection. Recent advancements in metagenomics and next-generation viral genomic sequencing have exacerbated the problem because of the magnitude of new viral sequences discovered in a multitude of hosts and environmental samples. This has altered dramatically the known viral sequence landscape. To cope with the volume of new viral sequence data, it has been proposed that the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) include official classification of viruses based solely on virus genome and metagenomics sequence information (1).",

In this article, we focus on the Alphacoronavirus 1 species of the Alphacoronavirus genus, to highlight some issues and limitations with current classification schemes and to provide some suggestions to improve them. This type species groups strains infecting distinct hosts and is based on a threshold level of more than 90% sequence identity in key coronavirus (CoV) replicase domains (pp1ab polyprotein and ORF1ab gene). However, this grouping leads to an association of viruses with divergent biological properties. Here, we propose a classification within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species based on the spike (S) gene sequence that allows the recapitulation of the complex evolutionary histories.",

The Alphacoronavirus 1 type species is composed of the following prototypical viruses (5): feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). FCoV is of particular interest as it manifests as two distinct biotypes (pathotypes) with a highly transmissible form, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which provokes self-limiting, usually mild, enteric tract infections, and a systemic form, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), typically associated with low transmissibility but high morbidity (6). In the widely accepted \u201cinternal mutation\u201d hypothesis, it is believed that genetic mutations in the genome of FCoV occur within an infected animal, giving rise to FIPV (7). A similar FIP-like pathogenesis is also observed with ferret coronaviruses (FRCoVs) (8). While CCoV is a widespread enteric virus of dogs and can occur in highly pathogenic forms, the virus does not manifest itself with FIP-like clinical signs (9).",

            "text": "The coronavirus spike (S) envelope glycoprotein, the main determinant of virus entry, is an essential structural protein as it is the main surface antigen, governs binding to the host cell receptor, and mediates viral membrane fusion. S is typically primed proteolytically by host cell proteases to activate its fusogenicity (10, 11). As such, the coronavirus S protein is a critical component as it determines to a large extent host species, tissue, and cell tropism as well as pathogenicity and transmission. Previous serological characterizations of alphacoronaviruses, based on the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein, have revealed the existence of two distinct FCoV serotypes (serotypes I and II) (12\u201314). Both serotypes can manifest as either FECV or FIPV biotypes. FCoV serotype I is more prevalent in cats than serotype II but has proved more difficult to culture in vitro (15, 16). Likewise, for CCoV, two serotypes (I and II) have been characterized and are distinguished by genetic differences in S and ORF3 genes. Serotype II CCoV strains can be further subdivided into the IIa, IIb, and IIc subtypes (9). CCoV IIa and IIb strains are distinguished by differences in the N-terminal domain of the S protein (NTD), where the IIb NTD is closely related to the TGEV NTD. The recently characterized IIc subtype of CCoV has been reported in Sweden and in the United States.",

It is thought that serotype I FCoV and CCoV originated from a common ancestor. A recombination event occurring between a serotype I CCoV and an unknown coronavirus gave rise to serotype II CCoV, which acquired a recombinant S protein, distinct from serotype I S. TGEV appears to have originated from a serotype II CCoV (17). Additional, independent recombination events between serotype I FCoV and serotype II CCoV gave rise to serotype II FCoVs, such as FIPV-WSU-79-1146 and FECV-WSU-79-1683, which acquired a serotype II CCoV S protein (18). Furthermore, we have previously shown that CCoV strain A76 also has a recombinant S protein, a product of recombination between serotype I and II CCoV sequences (19). CCoV-A76 S was shown to have a serotype I-like S1 N-terminal domain (NTD), while the rest of the protein was serotype II-like. Analysis of coronavirus recombination events within the S protein sequence revealed its modular nature, allowing exchange of functional domains between coinfecting viruses (19, 20).",

In addition to serological differences, serotype I and II S proteins are fundamentally different in several biological aspects. While the receptor for serotype II FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV has been shown to be aminopeptidase N (APN, or CD13), the receptor for serotype I strains remains unknown. Serotype I S proteins contain a cleavage site, the S1/S2 site, not present in serotype II or other alphacoronaviruses. This site has been shown to be important for cell culture adaptation and pathogenesis of FCoV (21, 22). Because of the critical role played by S protein in virus entry, pathogenesis, and tropism and since the S proteins of serotype I and II strains differ greatly, we propose a classification of Alphacoronavirus 1 strains into two clades (Alphacoronavirus 1 clades A and B), using a functionally based S protein sequence classification that reflects the previously determined serologically based demarcation. We argue that, when available, combining function-based data with sequence-defined taxonomic groupings should be encouraged as it allows for useful, biologically relevant virus classifications.",

The S1 analysis shows similar relationships as in the complete spike analysis but with the recombinant CCoV-A76 strain being more closely related to clade A viruses, reflecting its serotype I-derived NTD (Fig. 2A and B) (19). For the S2 analysis, while the serological demarcations are retained, the CCoV-A76 strain is found more closely related to clade B or serotype II strains due to its recombinant S protein (Fig. 2C). A characteristic feature of serotype I FCoV and CCoV is an S cleavage site containing a polybasic furin recognition motif at the junction between the S1 receptor-binding domain and the S2 fusion domain, S1/S2 (Fig. 2D). Alignment of protein sequences of alphacoronavirus S1/S2 S cleavage sites reveals that serotype I CCoV and FCoV contain a 16- to 19-amino-acid insert, with a stretch of basic residues, flanked by fairly well conserved N- and C-terminal regions. This feature is absent in serotype II FCoV, CCoV, TGEV, and ferret CoV, mink CoV, or other alphacoronaviruses. The lack of an S1/S2 furin site in CCoV-A76 S protein sequence is in agreement with the fact that only the NTD of the CCoV-A76 S protein is serotype I-like, with the rest of the protein being serotype II-like, including the region around the S1/S2 site. Overall, these alignment observations are in good agreement with the complete S, S1, and S2 phylogenetic tree analyses.",

Adding to the confusion are the different terms used to designate various Alphacoronavirus 1 strains: FCoV serotypes and types; CCoV serotypes, types, and genotypes; and TGEV, which is not classified according to FCoV/CCoV serotypes. We propose a more unified classification, based on the important serological and sequence differences between the S proteins of serotype I and II viruses. Our analysis reveals two well-defined clades, clade A and clade B, corresponding to the serotype groupings. Both clades contain FCoV and CCoV strains, while TGEV belongs only to clade B, in agreement with the finding that TGEV is most closely related to clade B (serotype II) CCoV. We recommend the inclusion of representatives of both clades when performing phylogenetic analysis of alphacoronaviruses. The proposed classification scheme for the alphacoronaviruses is similar to the one used to characterize lineages and clades of avian influenza viruses. Indeed, instead of performing phylogenetic analyses on the entire genomes, avian influenza virus classifications are based on the surface protein genes, e.g., that for hemagglutinin (HA) (24).",

In our analyses, using complete genome phylogenies, strains were clustered according to the host that they infected, whereas the S-based phylogeny allowed grouping of FCoV and CCoV strains together in separate clades. Our approach allows for a better understanding of the complex phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history observed in coronaviruses. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis on S proteins can reveal relationships that are not observed using replicase domains or complete-genome-based analysis. In particular, in a study characterizing novel deltacoronaviruses, Woo and colleagues showed that the S proteins of alphacoronaviruses are more closely related to deltacoronaviruses than to other coronavirus genera (4).",
