However, analysing Africa\u2019s development prospects based solely on indicators such as GDP growth rates, per capita incomes, or increase in mobile phone use is misleading. Africa is still deficient in terms of manufacturing. Agriculture and extraction of natural resources are still at the core of most African economies, in contrast to the industrialization that is characteristic of wealthier global economies, such as the USA and China. Indeed, a recent UN report paints a more realistic portrayal of Africa\u2019s development prospects, finding that despite some improvements, some African countries are at a standstill in terms of industrialization, with some even moving backwards. Service industries alone cannot, in the long\u2013term, create enough jobs for the millions of African youth; instead, trade arrangements and bilateral agreements should be revised such that Africa is able to adopt sustainable, long\u2013term industrialization policies.

The drug could become the first discovery in the fight against malaria in two decades. The malaria parasite survives in red blood cells, which are full of salt, and \u201c...the parasite is quite leaky, but it\u2019s got a very effective molecular salt pump, that keeps pushing the salt out again,\u201d said Professor Kiaran Kirk, director at the Research School of Biology at Australia National University (ANU). Research teams in the United States and Singapore had developed a drug that attacked the protein that makes up the salt pump, but it wasn\u2019t until the ANU researchers tested it that they confirmed it worked effectively. The drug attacks the salt pump and disables it, causing the parasite to fill up with salt and die. Targeting such a basic function is crucial because malaria tends to evolve quickly, developing resistance and rendering other drugs ineffective. (Reuters, 19 Feb 2013)",

Official bilateral and multilateral donors pledged as much as US$ 13 billion and almost 50% of these pledges have been disbursed, according to UN sources, while private donations added further US$ 3 billion. However, three years after the tragedy it is not really clear how the money was spent or whether the desired outcomes were achieved. (The Guardian, 14 Jan 2013)",

During her tenure, she became an icon of global development. (Devex, 31 Jan 2013)",

The UNICEF Representative in Mexico, Ms Isabel Crowley, said that although the economy has grown well in Mexico, this does not always mean that the poor are better off, because human development indexes in parts of Mexico are close to those of some of the world\u2019s least developed countries. Moreover, children are overrepresented among the poor. In 2010, 46% of all Mexico\u2019s residents lived in poverty, but in children the poverty rate rises to 54%. The study also reported that nearly 14% of Mexican pre\u2013school children are stunted, ie, slowed in their development, which is often a result of malnutrition. The rate is higher in rural areas, reaching nearly 33% among indigenous children. (UN News, 3 Apr 2013)",
