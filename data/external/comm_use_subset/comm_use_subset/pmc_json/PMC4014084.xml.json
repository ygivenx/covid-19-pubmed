The M, S and E viral membrane proteins are translated on membrane-bound polysomes, inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and transported to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where E and M interact and trigger budding\n[5,6]. N and S are incorporated into virions via interaction with M, with virions accumulating in large, smooth-walled vesicles that eventually fuse with the plasma membrane and release virions from cells\n[2,7-11].",

The addition of hexamethylene amiloride (HMA, an ion channel inhibitor of mouse hepatitis coronavirus [MHV] and human coronavirus 229E [HCoV229E] ion channel activity in vitro) to culture medium blocks MHV and HCoV229E replication\n[12], suggesting that the coronavirus E ion channel plays a role in virus replication. Two or three cysteine residues are located on the carboxyl side of the hydrophobic domain in coronavirus E proteins, with some serving as targets for palmitoylation\n[14-17], which may contribute to virus assembly in the MHV.",

Although M and N co-expression is also sufficient for SARS-CoV VLP production\n[21,22], VLP yields are further enhanced by E co-expression\n[23]. According to these data, SARS-CoV E plays a supporting role in promoting virus assembly and/or budding. E and N are thought to be packaged into VLPs through separate and individual associations with M; it remains unknown whether E/N interaction exists, which might contribute to enhanced virion production. MHV and IBV E proteins are capable of release from cells as vesicles\n[5,24], implying a relationship between E release and its contribution to virus production. Our goal for this study was to determine whether SARS-CoV N is capable of interacting with E and cell release via an association with E-containing vesicles. Our results indicate no correlation between SARS-CoV E capacity to release or interact with N, or its ability to promote VLP production.",

In addition, E74LL/AA was capable of producing VLPs as efficiently as wt when co-expressed with M and N (Figure \n5A, lanes 16 vs. 17 and 18). These results suggest that 74-LL-75 was not functionally involved in E release, E/N interaction, or the promotion of VLP production. Conversely, E\u039476A was not capable of efficiently promoting N release, and exhibited a reduced release capacity (Figure \n5B, lanes 12 to 15). GST pull-down assay data suggest that the E\u039476V mutation markedly affected E/N interaction, but exerted no major impacts on N/M association (Figure \n5C, lanes 16 vs. 18). The level of GST-N-associated E was significantly lower than that of GST-M-associated E, suggesting that E/N association is not as strong as E/M association (Figure \n5C, lanes 15 vs. 17). While pull-down assay results suggest an association between E\u039476V and M, E\u039476V release was not significantly enhanced following M co-expression (Figure \n5C, lane 18 vs. Figure \n5B, lanes 17 and 20). A possible explanation is steric hindrance during VLP assembly. Note that E\u039476V was still capable of promoting VLP production as efficiently as the wt, despite defective packaging into VLPs (Figure \n5B, lane 20). This suggests that the SARS-CoV E contribution to VLP production is independent of its ability to be packaged into VLPs.",

It is likely that there may be a combination of these different VLPs in culture medium when cells are co-transfected with M plus E and N. The iodixanol density gradient fractionation analyses suggest that released E vesicles and E-N VLPs exhibit slightly higher densities compared to those of M-E-N VLPs (Figure \n2C). Since M is the major viral component, the strong presence of M molecules may exert a spatial effect that explains, at least in part, the lower density for M-E-N particles. We consistently observed marked E-N VLP yield enhancement following M co-expression. Since M is the most abundant viral structural protein capable of recruiting both E and N into VLPs, we do not consider this a surprising result. In addition, M exhibits a noticeably higher N binding capacity than E (Figure \n5C). VLPs formed by M, E and N look more morphologically homogeneous than E-N VLPs, possibly due to additional intermolecular interactions between M/M, M/E and M/N.",

Blocking MHV E palmitoylation results in significantly impaired VLP assembly, suggesting that palmitoylated E proteins are essential for murine coronavirus assembly\n[14]. In the present study we found that changing all three cysteines into alanines (EC3A) did not exert negative effects on SARS-CoV E protein release or VLP assembly (Figure \n4). This suggests that E palmitoylation or interchain disulfide bond formation is not required for SARS-CoV E protein release or VLP assembly.

Furthermore, E\u039476A was still capable of enhancing VLP production even though it was defective in both release and N association. Although E\u039476A is capable of M association (as shown by GST assays), it is not efficiently incorporated into VLPs when co-expressed with M. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the disruption of cellular compartments allows E/M to associate at a higher capacity, whereas less E/M association occurs in assembly and budding compartments such as ER/Golgi, resulting in smaller amounts of E being packaged into virions. This scenario is compatible with the proposal that E may promote virus assembly and/or budding by facilitating membrane bending and scissions without required packaging into virions. In support of this hypothesis, one research team has reported that E deletion does not significantly affect SARS-CoV replication, but that E-deleted mutants exhibit 100- to 1,000-fold reductions in virus yields associated with decreased efficiency during morphogenesis\n[32]. Although E/N interactions may not be directly involved in virus assembly and budding, it remains to be seen whether the SARS-CoV E contribution to virus production requires efficient E/M interaction.",
