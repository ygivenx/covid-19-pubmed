            "text": "Although there are an enormous number of studies in the literature exploring the volume-outcome issue, the findings are not consistent. In the topic of volume-infection, the controversial findings can perhaps be attributed to two major issues. Firstly, the identification of infection cases might not have been accurate. Most studies analyzed the relationship between provider volumes and infection on the basis of claims data. [2\u20134] Researchers usually have identified infection cases through International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) infection codes. In contrast to surveillance data, the use of administrative data can increase sample sizes due to reduced labor intensity and also facilitate the efficiency and standardization of case identifications. [5] However, several studies have indicated that the ICD-9-CM codes might be inappropriate for identifying such cases in claims data because of insufficient code list and coding bias. [2, 6\u20138] These problems might not only over- or under-estimate the number of infection cases, but also affect the validity of studies, especially in patient-level studies. [9, 10] The use of surrogate markers or development of identification models has been popular in the identification of cases of healthcare-associated infections since 2000. For example, Yu et al [11] used utilization of antibiotics (e.g. type, dose, second-line antibiotics), length of stay, and number of vessels obstructed etc., to develop the CART and other alternative models for the identification of cases of CABG SSIs, based on the National Health Insurance claims data and healthcare-associated infection surveillance data from two medical centers in Taiwan, and compared the performance between these models and the ICD-9 CM codes.",

In the ICD-9-CM based model, SSI cases were divided into two categories: index hospitalization events and post-discharge events (i.e., SSIs that occurred within 1 year after discharge and required readmission to a hospital and/or the use of ambulatory services). Following Wu et al [13], this study adopted the secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for index hospitalization events (ICD-9-CM code: 996.03, 996.61, 996.72, and 998.5), and the primary and secondary diagnosis codes for post-discharge events (ICD-9-CM code: 038.0\u2013038.4, 038.8, 038.9, 682.6, 682.9, 780.6, 790.7, 875.0, 875.1, 891.0, 891.1, 996.03, 996.61, 996.72, 998.3, and 998.5.) as the criteria for SSI identification, in order to avoid cases in which infection existed prior to hospitalization.

But, except for provider\u2019s experiences, SSIs are also impacted by many factors, such as environmental and clinical factors. Wu et al once used Taiwan 2001 NHI claims data to explore the relationship between provider CABG operation volumes and SSIs. [13] They found that hospital volumes had a greater effect than surgeon volumes and claimed that this may imply that hospital teamwork is more important than individual surgeon. However, our findings demonstrated that there was no relationship between hospital volumes and SSIs. Wu et al. adopted the cumulative operation volumes within the study period as the definition, and identified SSIs by ICD-9-CM codes. Except, there were two differences between our work and Wu et al., which were the length and year of the data; our data was longer and more updated than theirs. Moreover, it is worth noting that there was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan in 2003, after which the hospital infection control system in Taiwan was reviewed and re-designed. Wu et al data was before SARS, so these efforts may also have improved the level of SSIs control in hospitals, leading to different findings in this study.",

Although the performance of the CART model to identify CABG SSIs was better than ICD-9-CM codes in Taiwan NHI claims data, it did not reach the perfect scenario. The accuracy of SSIs identification was still a challenge in our work. The second limitation relates to unmeasured variables, such as length of stay before operation, infection condition, hair removal, clinical information (e.g. blood glucose level, causative microorganism), time-related information (e.g. the duration of operation), the environment, surgical skills, use of post-operative drains, number of operations involved, and surgical site and wound care, etc.[40] Furthermore, information about type (elective or urgent) and incision site for surgery was not available in the Taiwan NHI claims data.",
