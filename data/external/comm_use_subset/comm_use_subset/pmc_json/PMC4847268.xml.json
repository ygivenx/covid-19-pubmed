Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) has greatly improved test sensitivity and reduced the time-to-result, enabling pathogen detection in patients long after symptom onset or antibiotic therapy [6]. However, most PCR tests provide high throughput capacity but not rapid real-time test results due to the common practice of batching samples to gain efficiency [7, 8]. Moreover, laboratory diagnosis of respiratory infections has been affected by substantial variations in collection and transport methods. The emergence of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved automated, rapid \u201cmega\u201d-multiplex PCR platforms (RM-PCR) such FilmArray\u2122 (BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT) exemplifies a technical breakthrough, enabling rapid diagnosis of acute viral and bacterial respiratory infections from a swab specimen and a single molecular panel.",

Both RM-PCR (FilmArray) for respiratory viruses and a laboratory-developed PCR (LD-PCR) for three pertussis pathogens (B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. holmesii) were deployed during this outbreak [8]. At the time, detection of B. pertussis was included within the panel of RM-PCR panel but results were unavailable to laboratory for reporting pending FDA approval. B. pertussis detection results were obtained post hoc following licensure of the expanded RM-PCR panel by FDA in October 2012 [10]. In addition to increased laboratory utilization of high throughput LD-PCR during the pertussis outbreak, our diagnostic operation also included culture for all PCR-positive samples, achieving a 48 % culture-positivity rate that was useful in statewide epidemiological studies of pertussis [3].",

The assessment of physician suspicion of potentially either a respiratory viral or pertussis infection was based on the presence of physician orders for both pertussis by LD-PCR and respiratory viruses by RM-PCR. We therefore planned to evaluate three groups (or cohorts) in our analysis: (1) children suspected for pertussis alone (with only LD-PCR for pertussis ordered); (2) children in whom pertussis was not suspected (with only RM-PCR for respiratory viruses ordered); and (3) children suspected for viral illness and/or pertussis (with both LD-PCR and RM-PCR ordered).",

The limit of detection for LD-PCR was determined to show 90 % reproducibility at a minimum of 15 copies per PCR reaction. Consensus criteria for interpreting results used 3 targets, where either 2\u20133 positive targets with specific melt curve (IS481, ptx promoter region, and/or recA) or a single reproducible positive target were accepted as positives, with a contingency that if IS481 was the only target positive, test to rule out B. holmesii is carried out [8]. Testing was batched; results were typically available within 4\u201315 h. Bacterial culture for pertussis was performed on all PCR-positive specimens by inoculating the same swab (post PCR elution) on Regan-Lowe agar. A sheep blood agar was added if specimen was positive for B. parapertussis or B. holmesii.

The RM-PCR utilizes a two-step nested multiplex PCR process, including primary multiplex PCR followed by an array of organism-specific second-stage PCR reactions [14]. The RM-PCR for pertussis targets only the toxin promoter region; cross reactivity with B. parapertussis is not observed at concentrations less than 106 CFU/ml [15]. Although the limit of detection was listed in the FilmArray product description for B. pertussis at 4000 CFU/ml, we have further verified that the sensitivity of the test can approach 31 CFU/ml using serial dilutions running in duplicate. The specific RM-PCR panel at the time was approved to detect 8 viral pathogens and their subtypes, including influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B), RSV, parainfluenza viruses(PIV) 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus (CoV) HKU1 and NL63, adenovirus (AdV), and rhinovirus/enterovirus (RhV). This assay detected but did not reveal results from three bacterial pathogens (B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) until FDA approval in October, 2012.",

Our results suggest similar performance between RM-PCR and LD-PCR methods in identifying pertussis pathogens. Although we were unable to culture pertussis from the 6 samples with discordant results, these cases are likely to be true positives based on evidence of exposure to pertussis, detection of pertussis by other laboratories, and/or the presence of coughing paroxysms. It is possible that the discordant specimens had low copy number of B. pertussis DNA and/or sampling variation. The 5 cases missed by LD-PCR could potentially also be related to PCR inhibition with aluminum-shaft swabs [17]. Limitations associated with the design of RM-PCR include the capacity to test only one specimen at a time and to detect only B. pertussis. Consequently, the emergence of B. parapertussis and B. holmesii may be overlooked [13, 18]. In addition, the use of antibiotic-containing media for specimen collection precludes culture for viable organisms, necessitating both molecular and epidemiological investigations [3, 19].",

Influenza appeared to be recognized by clinicians as well; nearly twice as many laboratory-confirmed Flu A/B cases occurred in the viral-only tested Cohort 2 compared to the dual tested Cohort 3 (17 vs. 9.6 %, respectively; p < 0.001). Our retrospective analysis supports the use of RM-PCR in children <24 months as the findings of both respiratory viruses (including multi-viral co-infections) and pertussis are significantly higher in this age group (Table 1).",
