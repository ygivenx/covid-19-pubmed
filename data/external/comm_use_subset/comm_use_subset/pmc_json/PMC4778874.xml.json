            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the family Filoviridae, is the causative agent of severe hemorrhagic fever in humans, which is responsible for the outbreak in West African countries in 2014 [1]. Following EBOV infection, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are the early and preferred replication sites of this virus, after which other cell types, including endothelial cells, epithelial cells and hepatocytes, are rapidly infected [2,3]. In experimental animal models, excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines occurs during lethal EBOV infection, leading to endothelial cell permeability, multiorgan failure, and severe clotting disorders and culminating in a final septic shock-like syndrome [4\u20136]. More importantly, a fatal outcome in infected patients is also associated with aberrant innate immunity characterized by a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, with hypersecretion of numerous proinflammatory mediators [3,7], suggesting that the inflammatory response plays an important role in EBOV pathogenesis. Consequently, identification of the molecular mechanisms of the inflammatory response is very important to our understanding of EBOV diseases.",

Glycoprotein (GP) gene is the fourth of seven genes and encodes type I transmembrane GP termed pre-GP via transcriptional RNA editing [8,9]. The pre-GP is cleaved by furin into two subunits, GP1 and GP2, which remain linked by a disulfide bond [10,11]. This heterodimer (GP1,2) is known to form a trimer on the viral surface. The cleavage of surface GP by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE) releases a trimeric GP, termed shed GP [12]. During EBOV infection, significant amounts of shed GP can be detected [12]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that shed GP can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by activating non-infected DCs and macrophages, which can explain the dysregulated inflammatory host reactions to Ebola infection [13]. In addition, Ebola virus-like particles (eVLPs) consisting of virus protein (VP40) and GP are able to induce the activation of DCs [14]. GP is required for eVLPs to induce DCs cytokine production [15,16]. All of these results support that GP can induce inflammatory response. However, the molecular mechanism underlying GP-mediated inflammatory responses is unclear.",

            "text": "Inflammatory responses are rapidly elicited in response to infection by pathogens [17,18]. Innate immune cells including macrophages and DCs play important roles in this process. DCs and macrophages express diverse pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit inflammatory immune responses via upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6. C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) have been identified as PRRs and play important roles in initiating an innate immune response [19]. The functions of these receptors in immunity as PRRs for carbohydrates present on fungi and some bacterial have been well defined, such as via dectin-1 and DC-SIGN, which signal through Syk [20] and Raf-1 [21], respectively. However, the role of CLRs in inflammation mediated by virus components is less documented. The lectin LSECtin is encoded in the same chromosomal locus as DC-SIGN and also expressed by human peripheral blood DCs as well as DCs and macrophages generated in vitro [22,23]. It has been reported that LSECtin binds exogenous Ebola GP [24,25] and mediates its internalization as a PRR [23]. However, it is unclear whether LSECtin initiates specific signaling events and is involved in GP-mediated inflammatory responses.",

To verify whether LSECtin interacts GP, recombinant protein GP1-Fc was prepared and subjected to Coomassie blue staining and Western blotting (S1A and S1B Fig). In addition, we found that under nonreducing conditions, recombinant protein GP1-Fc is in monomeric form (S1C Fig). Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, our data demonstrated that GP1-Fc binds LSECtin in a dose-dependent way (S1D Fig). LSECtin has a typical carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and binds Ebola GP in a Ca2+-dependent manner [25]. Amino acid sequence alignment of the CRD of LSECtin with those of other C-type lectins indicates that 2 amino acids, Asn256 and Asn274, interact with Ca2+ through their carbonyl groups. Thus, we mutated the residues to aspartic acid. The mutant LSECtin (N256D or N274D) did not bind Ebola GP, which suggests that these residues are critical for recognition of EBOV GP (S1D Fig). Furthermore, we also performed a cell surface staining assay and demonstrated that Jurkat cells lentivirally transfected with LSECtin rather than mutant LSECtin bind GP (S1E Fig).",

As shown in S2A Fig, the anti-LSECtin mAb CCB059 did not stain granulocytes, monocytes or lymphocytes. We further investigated the expression of LSECtin on monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) by culturing monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 (S2B Fig). This treatment resulted in a strong up-regulation of LSECtin. In addition, this result was confirmed by PCR and Western blotting (S2C and S2D Fig). Ebola GP interacts with LSECtin stably expressed on Jurkat cell line. It was thus of interest to investigate whether GP could also bind LSECtin on human MDDCs. To address the issue, MDDCs were transfected with siRNA specific for LSECtin or with control siRNA for 48h (S3 Fig) and stained with GP1-Fc. First, we found that Ebola GP can bind MDDCs. More importantly, the activity is partially dependent on LSECtin. These results suggest that LSECtin involves GP binding to MDDCs (Fig 1A).",

Although eVLPs produced in insect cells or mammalian 293T cells exhibit similar DC-stimulating activities [26], eVLPs were also produced in 293T mammalian cells to determine whether the data are influenced by the insect cell expression system for GP. Similar with the results shown in Fig 1B, eVLPs produced in 293T mammalian cells induced less production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and MIP-1\u03b1 in LSECtin \u201cknockdown\u201d MDDCs (Fig 1C).

To simulate the configuration and multivalency of GP on eVLPs or shed GP, GP1-Fc was coated on a culture well for stimulation of MDDCs. To directly investigate the role of LSECtin in GP1-mediated proinflammatory cytokine production, control or LSECtin siRNA-transfected MDDCs were stimulated with plate-bound GP1-Fc. Similar to the results as described above, GP1-Fc-induced cytokine production was impaired in LSECtin \u201cknockdown\u201d DCs (Fig 1D). In addition, our results demonstrated that the production of cytokines induced by eVLPs and plate-bound GP1-Fc was inhibited by Pepinh-MYD, a MyD88 inhibitor peptide, which is consistent with the previous reports that eVLP and shed GP induced cytokine production through TLR4/MyD88 signaling (S5A and S5B Fig) [13,27]. However, the cytokine production induced by LPS is not impacted in LSECtin \u201cknockdown\u201d DCs, suggesting that MyD88 signaling pathway is intact (Fig 1D). Given that the production of cytokines is partially inhibited by LSECtin silencing or MyD88 inhibitory peptide, we next determined whether there is a synergistic efficacy of LSECtin silencing in combination with MyD88 inhibitory peptide. We found that MDDCs treated by double silencing produced less TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 than LSECtin silencing or MyD88 inhibitory peptide alone treated cells (Fig 1E). In addition, we also demonstrated that there is a synergistic efficacy of LSECtin and TLR4-induced cytokines after LSECtin/TLR4 double \u201cknockdown\u201d DCs (S6 Fig).

We treated MDDCs with immobilized anti-LSECtin mAbs. The production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 was significantly increased in MDDCs after 24h of treatment with CFD051, compared with CCA023, CCB059 and the control mIgG1, suggesting that only CFD051-LSECtin engagement promoted cytokine production (Fig 2A). We also observed similar changes in mRNA levels. We found that LSECtin engagement induced rapid but transient mRNA expression for the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig 2B). The IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA amounts peaked approximately 3h after LSECtin ligation and subsequently declined to close to baseline 6h after LSECtin crosslinking. In addition, LSECtin engagement increased the maturation of MDDCs, as characterized by increased surface expression of HLA-DR, CD83 and CD86 (Fig 2C). Interestingly, GP/LSECtin interaction also triggers the maturation of DCs as the surface expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86 decreased in LSECtin \u201cknockdown\u201d DCs (S7 Fig).",

To determine whether the two tyrosines of DAP12 are required for LSECtin/DAP12-mediated phosphorylation of protein tyrosines, we transduced a lentivirus encoding wild-type (WT) or mutant DAP12 in which the ITAM tyrosines at positions 91 and 102 were mutated to phenylalanine (2YF) into Jurkat-LSECtin stable cells. Our results show that eVLP stimulation enhanced the phosphorylation of protein tyrosines in Jurkat-LSECtin cells expressing WT but not mutant DAP12 (Fig 4C), suggesting that the two tyrosines within the ITAM are required for LSECtin/DAP12-mediated phosphorylation of protein tyrosines. We next determine whether ligation of LSECtin results in tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12. Jurkat-LSECtin/DAP12 and Jurkat-LSECtin/DAP12(Y2F) stable cells were stimulated with eVLP. To detect DAP12 phosphorylation, DAP12 protein was immunoprecipitated and tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12 was examined with 4G10 antibody. Our results show that eVLP induced DAP12 phosphorylation in Jurkat-LSECtin cells expressing WT but not mutant DAP12, although mutant DAP12 can also co-precipitate LSECtin (Fig 4D). More importantly, MDDCs stimulated with eVLP were found to induce DAP12 phosphorylation, but knockdown of LSECtin resulted in a substantial decrease in DAP12 phosphorylation (Fig 4E). In addition, the phosphorylation of DAP12 is independent on TLR4 activation as the effect is not affected after TLR4 \u201cknockdown\u201d in MDDCs (S11 Fig).

To determine whether endogenous LSECtin could activate the Syk tyrosine kinase, we stimulated MDDCs with plate-bound anti-LSECtin mAb. Consistent with the results shown in Fig 2A, only plate-bound CFD051 Ab induced phosphorylation of the kinases Syk and ERK in MDDCs (Fig 5A). In addition, the Syk inhibitor piceatannol abrogated the expression of cytokines in MDDCs induced by CFD051 in mRNA and protein levels (Fig 5B and 5C). Identical results were achieved with interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against Syk (S12 Fig), confirming specificity of the Syk inhibitor. Syk inhibition by piceatannol also abrogates the enhanced expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by LSECtin-TLR4 cross-talk (S13 Fig). Considering that another C-type lectin, DC-SIGN, has been shown to mediate signal transduction through Raf-1 [21], we investigated whether Raf-1 is also involved in LSECtin-mediated signaling. The Raf inhibitor GW5074 did not inhibit the expression of cytokines in MDDCs induced by CFD051 (S14 Fig). We next determined whether ligation of LSECtin by eVLP leads to the activation of Syk and ERK. We found that the activation of Syk and ERK induced by eVLP was significantly impaired in LSECtin \u201cknockdown\u201d DCs (Fig 5D). In addition, the phosphorylation of ERK induced by eVLP was also significantly impaired in TLR4 \u201cknockdown\u201d DCs, but the activation of Syk is independent on TLR4 signaling (S15 Fig). These results suggest that eVLP activates Syk through a LSECtin-dependent way. We then examined whether Syk is involved in cytokine expression induced by eVLP. Syk inhibition by piceatannol reduced the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by DCs stimulated with eVLP (Fig 5E), plate-bound GP1-Fc (Fig 5F) or eVLPm (Fig 5G). R406 is another specific Syk inhibitor and in clinical trials for human inflammatory diseases [30]. In the presence of R406, the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by DCs is also significantly suppressed after the stimulation by eVLPs (Fig 5H), plate-bound GP1-Fc (Fig 5I) or eVLPm (Fig 5G). As a control, LPS does not activate Syk kinase and the cytokine production induced by LPS is not suppressed in the presence of either piceatannol or R406 (S16 Fig), which suggests that the inhibition of Syk signaling by piceatannol or R406 is specific to the eVLP and GP1-Fc treatment.",

We used mAbs to selectively crosslink LSECtin, inducing Syk- and CARD9-dependent inflammatory cytokine production in DCs. It is noteworthy that the anti-LSECtin mAbs failed to induce cytokine production by DCs after transfection with LSECtin siRNA, which further confirms the specificity of the anti-LSECtin mAbs. Thus, LSECtin signaling by itself is sufficient to induce activation of the Syk/CARD9 pathway and gene expression.

However, the function of LSECtin as a PRR is still undefined. We have shown here that LSECtin recognizes Ebola GP and transduces an activating signal in DCs. This is contrary to DC-SIGN-mediated immunomodulatory function. For example, DC-SIGN was employed by measles virus to suppress antiviral type I IFN responses and then escape antiviral immunity [35]. It is noteworthy that we used eVLPs or plate-coated GP1-Fc to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by MDDCs. Previous studies showed that soluble GP1 alone does not induce cytokine production in human macrophages [15], and we confirmed this with MDDCs. The data is different from that soluble shed GP which can induce the secretion of cytokines. Shed GP is a trimer, but GP1-Fc is a monomer in our study (S1 Fig). Therefore, the different structures of soluble shed GP and GP1 maybe cause their varied ability of activating DCs. In addition, sera Lectins especially MBL in FBS used in our stimulation systems might also interfere GP binding DCs since MBL present in human sera is capable of affecting the binding of shed GP to cells [13].",

Piceatannol and R406, two Syk inhibitors, both significantly inhibit the cytokine production induced by eVLPs or plate-coated GP1-Fc. eVLPs trigger protein tyrosine phosphorylation in LSECtin- and DAP12-co-expressing Jurkat cells, and this effect is dependent on the ITAM of DAP12. Alignment of the LSECtin amino acid sequence indicates that 2 amino acids within CRD, Asn256 and Asn274, interact with Ca2+ through their carbonyl groups. Recognition of Ebola GP by LSECtin appears to be dependent on carbohydrates, as eVLPs do not trigger protein tyrosine phosphorylation in mutant LSECtinN256D or N274D- and DAP12-co-expressing Jurkat cells. These results show that LSECtin is a novel DAP12-coupled myeloid CLR that acts as a PRR for Ebola GP.",

            "text": "Fatal EBOV infection in humans is associated with severe immune dysregulation and the hypersecretion of numerous proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, it has been demonstrated that trimeric shed GP released from virus-infected cells could activate non-infected DCs and macrophages, causing massive release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines [13]. In addition, Qiu et al. reported that ZMapp, a blend of three EBOV GP-specific mAbs, protected EBOV-infected nonhuman primates [38]. This protection occurred even when ZMapp administered 5 days after infection, a time at which the clinical signs of disease are apparent. However, the mechanisms by which protection is achieved are unclear [39]. Given that GP participates in the production of numerous proinflammatory cytokines, it is reasonable to speculate that ZMapp not only neutralizes EBOV infection but also inhibits the excessive cytokine storm by blocking the interaction between GP and its PRRs, such as TLR4 and LSECtin. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to inhibit the cytokine storm should be considered during treatment for Ebola infection, especially for the patients with obvious clinical symptoms. In this regard, treatment with anti-GP, anti-TLR4 and anti-LSECtin Abs could be used to reduce the inflammatory responses caused by shed GP and may be helpful to alleviate the septic shock-like syndrome observed with EBOV infection.",
