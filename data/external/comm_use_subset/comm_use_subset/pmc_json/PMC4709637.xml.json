In contrast to the mock-treated cell lysate results, CHN06 infection led to a rapid and transient increase in ERK phosphorylation within 15 min p.i., which declined by 30 min p.i., and returned to the basal level by 2 h p.i. ERK phosphorylation increased again at 6 h p.i., subsiding by 12.5 h p.i., and then activation resumed between 108 h and 132 h p.i. (Fig. 3a).

Similar to the results of ALV-J strain infection, both GD13-1 and CD08 activated ERK phosphorylation as early as 15 min and as late as 120 h after infection of DF-1 cells. Moreover, ALV-J strain NX0101 and two strains of ALV-J isolated from clinical plasma samples, which were numbered KNE131218 and JX130911A7, increased p-ERK expression at 120 h p.i.

Various inhibitors have no cell toxicity except 20 \u03bcM LY294002 (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, only PD98059 inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation while SP600125 or SB203580 had no influence on c-Jun activation at 15 min p.i (Fig. 6a\u2013c). Hence, we deduced that ALV infection activated AP-1 family members mainly through the ERK signaling pathway in DF-1 cells. More importantly, PD98059 simultaneously inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and VEGF-A expression at 120 h p.i (Fig. 6d).",

Figure 8b shows that electroporation of DF-1 cells with the vector induced visible phosphorylation of ERK2 and c-Jun, however, gag-expressing cells showed a greater degree of ERK2 and c-Jun phosphorylation. In contrast, cells transfected with the control vector or gag-expressing vector did not affect Akt, p38 or JNK activation. This result suggests that gag protein, whose gene is conserved among ALV subgroups, also contributed to the ALV-induced activation of the ERK2/AP1 pathway in DF-1 cells.

In our laboratory, we have previously reported that some exogenous ALVs induced Akt phosphorylation within 15 minutes30, while ALV also activated ERK within 15 min at the early infection stage in this study. Therefore, we tested the relationship between PI3K and MAPK activation in response to ALV infection. Consistent with the observations above, CHN06-induced Akt and ERK phosphorylation were PI3K-dependent and MAPKK-dependent, respectively. However, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no inhibition effect on ERK activation and MAPKK inhibitor PD98059 could not suppress Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 8c).

Similarly, a significant decrease in viral transcription was observed when SP600125 or SB203580 was added at \u22121, 0 or 1 h p.i. However, no statistical differences in viral transcription were observed when either inhibitor was added at 4 h p.i. Moreover, addition of U0126 at 0 h p.i had an inhibitory effect on the viral RNA levels of ALV-J and on the ALV-J-induced VEGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9b). Treatment of cells with inhibitors at \u22121, 0, 1, 2 and 4 h p.i. with ALV-J, showed that 20 \u03bcM SP600125 treatment resulted in a remarkable decrease in VEGF mRNA expression levels, however, incubation with 20 \u03bcM SB203580 showed no significant effect (Fig. 9c). These results demonstrated that MAPK primarily acted at an early stage of ALV-J replication cycle. The ERK pathway inhibitor, U0126, and the JNK pathway inhibitor, SP600125, significantly reduced the levels of VEGF mRNA expression, whereas the p38 pathway inhibitor, SB203580, exhibited no statistical difference in VEGF mRNA expression compared with DMSO treatment before ALV-J infection.",

The p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor, SB203580, also significantly inhibited ALV LTR promoter activity, but with a dose of 5 \u03bcM, hence, it was far less effective than PD98059. Interestingly, the JNK pathway inhibitor, SP600125 caused a dose-dependent increase in the levels of CHN06 LTR promoter activity and a dose-dependent decrease in the LTR promoter activity levels of NX0101, GD13-1 and CD08 strains (Fig. 10). These results suggest that the MAPK pathways play a role in the activation of the ALV LTR promoter. Moreover, of the three distinct MAPK signaling pathway inhibitors, the ERK pathway inhibitor, PD98059, contributed the most to LTR promoter activity inhibition.",

As such, many studies are currently attempting to define the molecular determinants of the ALV-J tumorigenic mechanisms. In light of the numerous reports on the association between the ERK/MAPK pathway and cancer, in addition to our in vitro experiments demonstrating the importance of activated ERK2 to ALV replication, we next examined the activation of MAPK in tumor cells from ALV-J-infected chickens. The methods of PCR tests on the genomic DNA of tissues and viral isolation assays have been previously described32 and the results were all positive for ALV-J, and negative for ALV-A, ALV-B, REV and MDV. Under the microscope, the tumor cells were observed as relatively uniform large myeloid cells and lymphoid cell hyperplasia in the liver whose morphology are similar to eosinophils (Fig. 13a, HE). Compared with normal cells in the liver, we observed a significant up-regulation of gp85 and pMAPK expression in tumor cells from ALV-J-infected liver. In contrast, only few cells expressing pMAPK were identified in quiescent livers without tumor cells and gp85 expression (Fig. 13a, p-ERK, gp85). Of note, both the tumor cells and normal cells exhibited abundant overall MAPK expression in the liver (Fig. 13a, ERK). These results were also confirmed by western blot analysis of tissue homogenates prepared from tumor tissues and normal tissues (Fig. 13b). These findings suggest that ALV-J-induced tumorigenesis in vivo could be correlated with MAPK activation.",

ALV-J, which originated from a recombination event between ALV and an endogenous retroviral element3435, induces a different spectrum of tumors than ALV-A and ALV-B, primarily myeloid leukosis and hemangiomas3. Although many studies concentrate on the ALV viral replication and tumorigenesis, the molecular basis of oncogenesis in these tumors is not well understood. In our pervious study, we proposed that ALV provirus has to integrate into the particular genes with a long latency to deregulate specific regulatory pathways and lead to malignant transformation7. Exploring cellular signaling pathways involved in virus replication and oncogenesis has become a potential objective. We took advantage of proteomics to identify the differential proteins and intracellular signal transduction pathways in DF-1 infected by ALV-J. The results demonstrated that MAPK1 involved in the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway was up-regulated at 60 h p.i. According to the bioinformatics analysis, Wang et al.36 have shown that the differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in the tumorigenesis-related MAPK signaling pathway, which may represent a possible signaling pathway involved in the ALV-J-induced tumorigenesis. Hence, we examined the role of the MAPK pathway during exogenous ALV infection and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "The experiments presented in the current study provide evidence that exogenous ALV could induce and sustain activation of ERK2, which is, in turn, required for productive virus replication. The best characterized MAPK module contains ERK1 and ERK2, which is the unique isoform in chickens. ERK2 was found to be phosphorylated at 15 min, 6 h and from 108 h to 132 h post ALV-J infection, suggesting that it was mainly activated at the early and late infection stages. Both ALV-A and ALV-B triggered the production of phosphorylated ERK at 15 min and 120 h p.i. Meanwhile we detected the phosphorylated p38 and c-Jun but not JNK activation at these time points. Besides, ALV-induced c-Jun-phosphorylation could be inhibited by PD98059 instead of SP600125 and SB203580. Hence, it may be active ERK2 that phosphorylates the transcription factor, c-Jun. c-Jun is a member of the AP-1 transcription factor family, and is highly responsive to extracellular signals that control proliferative and apoptotic programs37. ERK has been shown to phosphorylate and activate AP-1, which binds to specific genes at binding sites in their promoters3839. Dimerization of Jun is required for DNA binding, and DNA binding is necessary for transcriptional activation. All three properties, dimerization, DNA binding and transactivation, are essential for oncogenic transformation40. Megan et al. have shown that active ERK2 induced the activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and Elk-1, which was sufficient to induce differentiation or transformation depending on the cellular context41. MYC, TERT and ZIC1 genes are common targets of viral integration and transcriptional deregulation in ALV-J-induced myeloid leukosis7. Furthermore, tumor growth and metastasis require angiogenesis, which are regulated by VEGF204243. Wang et al.44 and Li et al.45 have found that VEGF-A was overexpressed in DF-1 cells after infection with ALV-J, indicating an increased opportunity for ALV-J to further induce the expression level of VEGF-A to reach the threshold level needed to promote tumorigenesis. AP-1 present in the promoter region of the human VEGF gene has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of VEGF gene expression4647. Intriguingly, 20 \u03bcM PD98059 or SP600125 inhibited VEGF mRNA expression in ALV-J-infected cells to approximately 50% (p < 0.001), whereas SB203580 did not affect it (p > 0.05). Actually, compared with the negative control DF-1 cells, the CHN06 strain of ALV-J caused a 1.75-fold up-regulation of VEGF mRNA at 72 h p.i. (data not shown). In this regard, both ERK and JNK pathways were involved in the regulation of VEGF gene expression after ALV-J infection. Though we did not detect JNK activation at 15min and 120h p.i, ALV infection may activate JNK at other time points. Surprisingly, PD98059 simultaneously inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and VEGF-A expression at 120 h p.i. We also found that the mRNA expression of VEGF in the tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in the control tissues. In light of our present study, we speculate that the ALV-induced oncogenic transformation was triggered by binding of active c-Jun to the promoters of candidate genes (e.g., VEGF, MYC, TERT and ZIC1). In our ongoing study, we hope to identify the promoter sequences and transcription factors\u2019 binding sequences in these chicken candidate genes to further verify the above hypothesis.",

            "text": "There is mounting evidence that activation of MAPK during infection plays an important role in the multiplication of a number of RNA and DNA viruses that replicate in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)48, influenza virus A and B4950, murine coronavirus51, Borna disease virus52, coxsackievirus B353, BK virus54, human cytomegalovirus55, herpes simplex virus 256, and the orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus (VCAV)57. In this study, we took advantage of four available MAPK signal pathway inhibitors, the ERK pathway inhibitor, PD9859 and U0126, the JNK pathway inhibitor, SP600125, and the p38 pathway inhibitor, SB203580, to further investigate the contribution of each MAPK signaling pathway to ALV virus propagation. To some degree, inhibition of the three kinds of MAPK pathways resulted in a reduction in ALV-J envelope mRNA levels in DF-1 cells, without exception. As ALV transcripts are mainly initiated from the 5\u2019LTR, generating DNA and mRNAs5859, we further investigated whether the MAPK inhibitors affect ALV 5\u2019LTR promoter activity. We found that PD98059 and SB203580 substantially reduced the5\u2019LTR promoter activity of ALV subgroups J, A and B in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, PD98059 almost completely blocked ALV 5\u2019LTR promoter activity with a mere 500nM dose. Of note, SP600125 lead to an obvious increase in the CHN06 5\u2019LTR promoter activity, whereas it inhibited the promoter activity of the NX0101, GD13-1 and CD08 stains. It is conceivable that the differential effect of the JNK inhibitor on the LTR promoter activity was due to the LTR sequence differences among the various strains. The unique 3\u2032 (U3) region of retroviral LTRs has been characterized with transcriptional enhancers and promoters60616263, and multiple cis-acting enhancer elements have been verified within the avian retroviruses64. Hence, it is possible that MAPK pathways influence LTR promoter activity by interacting with transcription control sequences, further affecting the transcription rate or RNA stability. However, the discrepant effects of SP600125 between CHN06 strain viral RNA level and LTR promoter activity remain unclear. Interestingly, when the ERK pathway was effectively blocked, for example in the presence of U0126 or PD98059, the expression of p27 and gp85 proteins dramatically decreased, whereas SP600125 and SB203580 only slightly decreased the viral protein synthesis. Thus, ERK/MAPK plays active roles in posttranscriptional regulation, supporting the concept that the ERK pathway contributes the most to ALV infection if compared with the other two pathways. This is consistent with other studies on HIV-1 infection65.",

In this study, we first verified that the MAPK pathways are involved in ALV replication and that gp85 or gag protein alone contributes to ERK2/AP-1, but not Akt, p38 and JNK activation. In view of the importance of ERK/MAPK in ALV-J infection, we further explored the relevance of ERK/MAPK activation to ALV-J-associated neoplasm. We showed that the presence of activated ERK2 in ALV-J-induced tumor cells, within which classical targets (gp85 protein) were identified for ALV replication in vivo, strongly correlated with virus-induced neoplasm. In other diseases such as visna virus-induced encephalitis67 and in human reactive astrocytes in response to CNS injury68, chronic activation of ERK1/2 was observed. In this context, the requirement of activated ERK2 for ALV replication is meaningful with regard to our current understanding of cellular proteins and pathways required for avian retroviruses replication and associated oncogenic pathology.",
