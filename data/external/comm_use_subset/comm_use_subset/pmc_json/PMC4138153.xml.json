            "text": "Rhinitis can be divided into allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR). AR occurs when an allergen is the trigger for the nasal symptoms. NAR is when obstruction and rhinorrhea occurs in relation to non-allergic, noninfectious triggers, such as changes in the weather, cigarette smoke, etc [2]. Approximately 10%\u201325% of the world population is affected by AR [3]. The worldwide prevalence of allergic rhinitis among adults has been on the rise since at least 1990 [4]\u2013[8]. In Sweden, the prevalence of AR increased from 22% to 31% from 1990 to 2008 in young adults [7]. However, less information is available on the prevalence or incidence of NAR. Generally, females [9], [10], young adults [10]\u2013[12], and those with allergic heredity [13], [14] are at higher risk of having AR. Allergen sources in the home environment are common, such as from pets [15], cockroaches [12], [14], house dust mites, microbiologic agents [16], [17], etc. Signs of dampness and indoor molds is another common exposure that has been widely studied in relation to both AR and NAR in home [17]\u2013[19]. Other factors such as traffic-related air pollution, different lifestyle and socioeconomic conditions are quoted as adjuvant factors for AR [20].",

Epidemiological studies have suggested that the prevalence of asthma in adults is approximately 7\u201310% in different parts of the western world [22]. The current trend (since 1990's) in the prevalence of asthma among adults is unclear, some studies suggesting that asthma prevalence has stabilized or even decreased [5], [7], [22], while, others suggesting it is still increasing [4]. However, asthma prevalence among children in many parts of the world is still increasing [23]. Asthma frequently co-exist with rhinitis [3], [24]\u2013[26]. Adult asthma is more common among females [27]\u2013[29], younger adults [27], and those with allergic heredity [27], [29]. Smoking [30], [31] and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) [29], [32]\u2013[34] were found to be associated with asthma or asthma related symptoms. A common finding is the association between observed building dampness and molds and adults' asthma [35]. Exposures related to building dampness can be house dust mites, molds, bacteria, and even chemicals (from the degradation process of building materials). Studies has shown that adults' asthma or asthmatic symptoms were associated with higher levels of cockroach allergen [36], mouse allergen [36], house dust mites [37], fungal [38], airborne bacteria [37], formaldehyde [39], [40] and total volatile organic compounds (VOC) [39], [40] in dwellings, newly painted indoor surfaces [41], and combustion of wood, coal or biomass fuels [34].",

The probability for a municipality to be selected was proportional to the size of the population of the municipality in December 31, 2006. The next step was selection of multi-family buildings from these 30 municipalities. Data on all multi-family buildings and their construction year were obtained from the central building register in Sweden. Stratified random sampling was used to sample buildings based on the construction year in 5 classes (before 1960, 1960\u20131975, 1976\u20131985, 1986\u20131995 and 1996\u20132005) aiming to get the same number of buildings in each age class.

The sample size of this study was reasonably large, and is one of few covering a sample from a whole country. The response rate was not very high (46%). The participation rate was higher among elderly persons, married persons, and slightly lower in larger cities, suburban municipalities and in older buildings. However, we have found no major difference in participation rate between different municipalities, between those being born in Sweden as compared to those foreign-born persons, and between those having or not having Swedish citizenships. Furthermore, most of the differences in participation rate were small. The elderly in our study accounted for 36% in our study. It has been shown that elderly population (more than 65 years old) in Sweden are accounting for 23% of the adult population [55]. Elderly in our study were more prone to answer questionnaire, and retired people lives more in apartments other than in single-family buildings in Sweden. Recall bias can be a potential problem in questionnaire surveys. Subjects may overestimate or underestimate their personal symptoms or reports on indoor environment risk factors. However, some factors, such as building constructed year, population density were not collected by questionnaire. Moreover, we found some associations between specific home environmental risk factors and health status, not a similar association for all risk factors.

Renting apartment can be a proxy variable for lower socio-economic status (SES). One Swedish study on multi-family buildings in Stockholm found that dwellers renting their apartments reported more nasal symptoms than those owning their homes, and found a high correlation between different socio-economic factors (apartment ownership, income, education, and occupation) [60]. One study on SES (defined by parental education) and children's respiratory and allergic symptoms conducted in 13 diverse countries found that lower SES was related to decreased prevalence of allergy to aero-allergens [61]. The association between SES and asthma prevalence and incidence in adults is not well understood and is a matter of debate [62]. However, lower SES seems to be associated with more severe asthma or poorly controlled asthma [62]. Asthma prevalence was higher in lower SES groups among adults [63] and among children [61]. In Sweden, a large number of multi-family apartments of all construction periods are rental, owned by the community, with similar living standards and rental costs as private apartments [64]. However families with lower SES are overrepresented in buildings built from 1961\u20131975, mostly rented and today buildings prioritized for renovation. The influence of ownership on health in our study may also depend upon differences in building maintenance, e.g. a lack of control over the home environment because of renting rather than owning.",

This finding is consistent with another Swedish study among adults living in multi-family buildings [65]. Building dampness problems in homes is associated with increased asthma prevalence, which has been shown in former studies [35], [43], [66], [67]. A cohort study found that new onset of adult asthma was related to dampness/molds in dwellings in Europe, and concluded that the population-attributable risk was 3\u201314% for observed dampness/molds [68]. One meta-analysis showed that wheeze among adults were associated with damp homes, and concluded that building dampness and molds were associated with approximately 30\u201350% increases in a variety of respiratory and asthma-related health outcomes [43]. Building dampness is related to a complex mix of exposures, including house dust mite allergens [69], microbial agents [70], [71], bacteria [71]\u2013[73], chemical emissions from degradation of building materials [74] as well as microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOC) [71].",

            "text": "We found that certain construction periods were associated with more respiratory illness. Buildings constructed from 1961\u20131975 were associated with more day time breathlessness. Buildings constructed from 1976\u20131985 were associated with more current rhinitis, infection rhinitis and respiratory infections in the last 3 months. Our age classification of multi-family buildings were based on major changes in buildings technology in Sweden. Buildings from 1961\u20131975 were constructed during a building boom in suburbs of large cities rented by poorer people. They were mostly poor quality high-rise buildings with basements and only exhaust ventilation. These buildings have been reported to have the highest prevalence of dampness problems [77]. The next generation of multi-family buildings (constructed during 1976\u20131985) was influenced by energy saving demands, with many changes in construction techniques and new building materials [64]. The drastic increase of the oil price in 1974 initiated energy saving measures to reduce energy consumption in buildings during this period. Moreover, in 1977 self\u2013level mortar containing the protein casein were introduced and used in Swedish buildings from 1977\u20131983. Due to severe indoor environmental problems this mortar was not used after 1983. Studies have shown that the problem was due to dampness causing chemical emissions such as ammonia and sulfhydryl compounds [78]. Later research identified another odorous compound, 2-acetophenone, emitted from the casein containing mortar. The compound is produced by degradation of the amino acid tryptophan [79]. It has a raw stuffy smell, and has been identified as a compound causing malodour in wine [80] and green tea [81]. The emission of ammonia from the mortar is known to cause blackening of parquet floors and degradation of acrylate polymers in water based glue and the plasticizer di-di-ethyl-hexyl-phthlate (DEHP) in polyvinylchloride (PVC) floor materials, causing emission of 2-etyl-1-hexanol to indoor air [82]. Epidemiological studies have shown that subjects staying in buildings with this type of mortar, and with emission of ammonia and 2-etyl-1-hexanol have a higher prevalence of mucosal inflammation and sick building syndrome [82] and asthma [74]. Thus, multifamily buildings constructed 1976-1984 had particular indoor exposures and were the first generation of buildings in Sweden with low ventilation due to increased energy saving demand and testing of new building materials on a large scale. This may have resulted in an impaired indoor environment leading to the elevated levels of health problems observed in this study.",

Polluted outdoor air entering the indoor environment when opening windows could be one explanation. However, this study included all multi-family buildings of the whole country, not only a small polluted area of Sweden. Another possible reason would be that those with asthma problems tried to improve ventilation situation by opening window more often (limitation of the cross sectional design).",

Negative or positive attitudes to the odors may (cognitive bias) influence the occurrence of irritative symptoms on experimental exposure to odorous compounds [84]. As our results were based on mutual adjustment models, it is less likely that differences in personal factors or attitudes would have biased our results. Odor perception in our study may be an indicator of poor ventilation. Increased ventilation was found to be associated with less report of odor among university students in computer classrooms [85]. Reported odor was related to higher levels of total fungal DNA in Swedish daycare centers in Sweden [86]. Pungent odor, musty odor and stuffy odor in multi-family buildings in Sweden were associated with asthma symptoms among adults [65]. Self-report of odor perceptions in dwellings were also found to be associated with SBS among adults in China [87]. Thus, odor perception can be associated with different types of exposure and can be of importance for asthma.",

The reason for the opposite finding in our study is not clear. Maybe some other activities that related to indoor painting improved the indoor environment but was not measured in our study. Paint used in indoor environment has becoming more and more environmental friendly with less and less chemical emissions, especially in developed countries like Sweden. One study compared new paint and conventional paint and found a significant increase in wheeze and breathlessness during use of conventional paint, but not with the new paint [88].

            "text": "The elderly in our study reported less pollen allergy, furry pet allergy, current rhinitis and respiratory infections in the last 3 months. The prevalence of environmental factors were also different. Two review articles have summarized articles on environment factors and respiratory health among the elderly [47], [48]. The first review summarized 59 articles about the adverse respiratory effects of outdoor air pollution among individuals >65 years [47]. The second review included 33 relevant publications about exposure to major indoor air pollutants and respiratory diseases [48]. Few studies are available on adverse effects of building dampness and molds in relation to respiratory symptoms among subjects above 60 years [48]. Building dampness (dampness index) were associated with current rhinitis, wheeze, day time breathlessness, current asthma and used antibiotic medication for respiratory infections in the last 12 months among subjects less than or equal to 65 years old in our study (born during1943\u20132008), but no significant association were found among subjects more than 65 years old (born before 1943). The possible explanation for our finding could be that the effects of dampness problems and renting apartments were different between elderly and others in Sweden. The elderly in our study was born before 1943, and others were born during 1943 to 1990. The major increase in atopic diseases in Sweden started among those being born in the early 1960's and later [56], [89]. The era with a lot of new chemical products started in the 1940s'. The elderly in our study was grown in a different environment (more exposed to a farming environment) compared with those younger (less than or equal to 65 years old), and which may make the elderly becoming less sensitive to building dampness and molds later in life. Sweden was a rural society in the old time and those born early were more often living on farms when they were young. Farming life experience in childhood was associated with a reduced risk of atopic sensitization [90] and less adult-onset of asthma [91].",
