Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belong to the Coronaviridae family, Coronavirinae subfamily, and genus Alphacoronavirus [5]. A new coronavirus genetically distinct from TGEV and PEDV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (genus Deltacoronavirus), has recently been associated with enteric disease in pigs [6]. Enteric porcine coronaviruses including TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV are characterized by acute diarrhea and anorexia with rapid dissemination in na\u00efve populations. The severities of clinical diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia can vary based on the age of the affected pigs [7, 8]. Without adequate passive lactogenic immunity, the mortality rate in neonatal piglets can reach up to 100% [1, 9\u201311]. Etiological diagnosis relies mainly on molecular tools like PCR and serology, as the clinical signs and enteric lesions associated with TGEV and PEDV are indistinguishable [8, 12, 13].",

In addition to swine, it has be documented that cats, dogs, and foxes can host TGEV [14]. The virus can be shed in feces for approximately 18 months, and milk shedding from infected sows can result in vertical transmission. Historically, TGEV infection has followed a seasonal pattern, becoming more prevalent during winter months perhaps due to increased viral survival in colder temperatures and with less exposure to sunlight. TGEV is susceptible to most commercial disinfectants, but resistant to digestive bile and stable at pH 3 [1]. Only one TGEV genotype has been described, however differences in pathogenicity among strains has been reported in field outbreaks, although not confirmed by an experimental study [12].",

In epidemics, TGEV enters a na\u00efve herd and all pig categories are affected, particularly piglets that are 1\u20132 weeks old. The duration of the clinical presentation is short, approximately 3 weeks, and in small, farrow-to-finish herd, the infection can be self-limiting [1, 14]. Endemic disease scenarios, those occurring after the epidemic phase, are observed in farms with incomplete AIAO management or in breeding farms that have a continuous flow of na\u00efve gilts. In breeding herds, the varying levels of humoral and lactogenic immunity lowers piglet mortality, but may lengthen the course of the disease [1].",

In South America, it has been reported in Colombia [16], Venezuela [17], Bolivia, and is currently seen in Brazil [18]. In Argentina, an episode of high pre-weaning mortality related to Isospora suis infection alone or in association with an unknown enteric virus was reported in 1998 [19]. Further studies using negative stain electron microscopy demonstrate the presence of viral particles consistent with coronavirus in feces of pre-weaning diarrheic (34.4%) and post-weaning (10%) piglets [20]. A retrospective histopathological study performed on cases of neonatal diarrhea at our laboratory during 2013 showed that 29% of neonatal diarrhea cases had lesions consistent with viral enteritis [21]. In 2014, a notification of TGEV infection was reported by the National Services of Animal Health of Argentina (SENASA) to the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE). It was detected by serology in a small farm with an apparent morbidity rate of 2.3% without clinical signs [22]. This is an unusual presentation of TGEV infection and might be related to passed infection or interspecies transmission [1].",

Their stomachs were empty or contained floccules of undigested milk. No other macroscopic findings were observed. The histopathological evaluation showed a shortening of intestinal villi with a crypt-villous ratio of 1:2 (Fig. 1b), that villi were fused and lined by vacuolated cuboidal or attenuated epithelium, and that the lamina propria was expanded by moderate edema. Microscopic lesions were limited to the jejunum and ileum. Immunohistochemistry and ISH-RNA against TGEV showed strong staining in the epithelium of sections that presented minimal epithelial villous changes (Fig. 1c, d). Conversely, sections with the most severe epithelial damages were IHC negative. All sections evaluated in this case were negative for PEDV and rotavirus.",

Both gilts and sows showed anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting before enteric signs were observed in neonatal piglets. However, the prevalence of clinical signs in the breeding stock was low and no mortality was reported. When TGEV enters in a na\u00efve herds, an epizootic form characterized by a 100% mortality of pre-weaning piglets due to diarrhea and dehydration is normally observed [1, 14]. Although in the present study, the farms had a high prevalence of diarrhea in suckling pigs, only farms A and C showed almost 100% neonatal mortality, while in farm B had approximately 20% neonatal mortality. The clinical presentation and epidemiological pattern observed in farm B resembled the TGE endemic form. Although no other etiological diagnosis was confirmed, the low mortality associated with TGEV that was observed in farm B might be the result of previous exposure to PRCV. PRCV infection can confer cross-protection against TGEV, reducing the enteric clinical signs and pre-weaning mortality [12]. Therefore, herds concomitantly infected with PRCV and TGEV develop less severe clinical signs, making the clinical differentiation from other enteric infections such as rotavirus or E. coli infections more challenging [1, 14]. Another potential reason for the low mortality rate due to TGE infection that was observed in farm B could be the intermittent viral exposure of the breeding stock that provided partial immunity to the neonatal piglets [14]. In all herds in this study, it was suspected that the virus entered the farms through the subclinically infected replacement animals that were not quarantined, or that the herds were exposed to the virus due to the proximity of a farm to a slaughterhouse (as seen in farm B).",

According to a previous study, the pre-weaning mortality due to diarrhea should not exceed 20% [26]. Usually, in porcine CoVs infections, the course of the clinical disease is short and normally does not exceed 3\u20134 weeks [14] due to the establishment of a rapid herd immunity, as early as one week post-infection. However, in farm B the clinical presentation persisted for approximately 2 months.

However, TGEV infection is segmental, so multiple segments should be included for histopathology or etiological diagnoses in situ such as IHC or ISH-RNA. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, fixed tissue was used to confirm the presence of TGEV and the morphological changes consistent with viral infection in the intestinal mucosa. It is important to highlight that although TGEV was detected by different means in each farm, due to the segmental nature of the lesions and viral distribution, viral ARN or viral antigen was not detected in all of the intestinal segments that were evaluated. In piglets that are less than 2 weeks old, the reduction of villus length and the fusion of jejunum and proximal ileum are the main histological changes [27]. The normal villous/crypt length ratio is 7:1, however, after 24\u201348 h post-infection, the villous/crypt ratio can be reduced to 2:1 or 1:1 [27]. Since TGEV replicates in mature absorptive epithelial cells [28], a false negative diagnosis can be observed by IHC or ISH in specimens that display villous shortening. Few absorptive vacuolated cells are seen normally in the intestine, however, during TGEV infection, they are found in great numbers with a cuboidal shape [27]. In endemic TGEV infection, histopathological diagnosis is more difficult because only 25% of pigs display typical TGE lesions. In addition, immunofluorescence tests and IHC often fail in endemic farms due to a low number of enterocytes in the TGEV-infected because of partial protection conferred by colostral antibodies [23, 29]. Different diagnostic techniques have been used to detect TGEV infection such as IHC, ISH, electron microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy and PCR [13]; however, histopathology remains the most useful tool for screening diagnosis [18]. In this study, although all cases were selected using clinical features and epidemiological information, the histological evaluation consistently showed lesions compatible with viral infection.",
