            "text": "Each year hundreds of millions of people are afflicted with respiratory tract infections caused by a wide range of viruses. Most cases of respiratory viral infections are asymptomatic or relatively mild, causing minor illness before the patient fully recovers. Serious illness can develop, especially among certain high-risk groups, leading to hospitalization, worsening of chronic conditions, and even death. In between are cases of moderate to severe respiratory tract infections in which patients seek outpatient medical attention, referred to as medically attended acute respiratory infection (ARI). These infections frequently result in lost productivity in the form of work or school absenteeism or reduced productivity due to attendance at work or school while sick (presenteeism).",

These viral pathogens vary in their pathogenesis, epidemiology, and temporal appearance throughout the year, but typically share a common set of symptoms including cough, fever, and rhinorrhea. Among the many viral ARIs seen in primary care each year, only a portion has been routinely tested to determine the offending organism because (i) rapid testing to differentiate among viruses is not readily available, and (ii) available treatments for most respiratory viruses are chiefly palliative, with the exception being antivirals for treatment of influenza.",

That study used singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR) to detect influenza virus. The University of Pittsburgh site of the Flu VE Network also used MRT-PCR. The purposes of this study were to (i) compare the agreement between SRT-PCR and MRT-PCR for influenza virus detection; (ii) examine the distribution of viruses associated with ARI visits during January through April 2012 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, using MRT-PCR; and (iii) compare personal characteristics and symptoms among those infected with various viruses. This study is among the first to examine a wide range of respiratory viral infections, including four CoVs and four PIVs, resulting in outpatient primary care visits among individuals across a broad age spectrum.",

Eligibility criteria included age \u22656 months as of 9/1/2011 and presentation at one of the participating primary care centers for treatment of an upper respiratory illness of \u22647 days duration, with cough or fever, and not taking an influenza antiviral (oseltamivir or zanamivir) before the medical visit. Emergency department visits were not included. Eligible individuals provided written informed consent, completed an enrollment survey, and were swabbed for nasal and oropharyngeal samples. Influenza vaccination status was combined from electronic medical record (EMR) data and self-report. Influenza activity did not increase appreciably over baseline levels as determined by local surveillance systems until mid-January 2012 in the Pittsburgh region; hence, study enrollment began in January and ended in April 2012. This prospective study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.",

Only single viruses or virus groups that were detected in more than 20 samples were used in the analyses, with the final six groups being: no virus detected, HRV, CoV, RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus type A. The measurement of agreement between the singleplex and multiplex influenza assays was determined using Cohen's kappa statistic. Descriptive statistics are presented as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for discrete variables. Participants were divided into three age groups \u2013 children (6 months\u201317 years), young adults (18\u201349 years), and older adults (\u226550 years). Bivariate multinomial regression models were used to assess the association of patient characteristics with the results of the MRT-PCRs because the probability distribution of the outcome variable consisted of more than two groups. The dependent variable is the virus group, and the independent variables are the participants' personal characteristics. To determine the independent effect, multinomial regression models were fit for each variable controlling for age and self-reported health status, with no virus detected as the reference group. For discrete characteristics with more than two levels that were statistically significant in the adjusted analysis, pairwise multinomial regression models were fit to assess the association of each level; Bonferroni corrections were used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Because the overall effect of age group was significant (P = 0\u00b701) in some analyses, pairwise comparisons between the different age groups were conducted to determine which pair of age groups had an effect on the dependent variable. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary NC, USA).",

Because of the few influenza B cases (n = 3) identified, both influenza A and B strains are reported together.

The sensitivity was 91\u00b71 and specificity was 98\u00b72 when SRT-PCR was treated as the gold standard. Of the 45 singleplex influenza positives, 41 (91%) were multiplex influenza positive (38 influenza A and 3 influenza B), 1 (2%) was multiplex negative for any virus, and 3 (7%) were multiplex positive for non-influenza viruses (HRV, mHMPV, and RSV). The cycle threshold (cT) value for this MRT-PCR influenza-negative but SRT-PCR influenza-positive sample was 29\u00b75; for the other three MRT-PCR negatives for influenza but positive for other viruses, the cT values were 26\u00b71, 29\u00b76, and 25\u00b73.

The multiplex assay identified 11 influenza positives not detected by singleplex RT-PCR (7 influenza only, 2 co-detected with RSV, and 1 each co-detected with mHMPV and CoV). The discordant influenza positives were distributed nearly equally among age groups: 3 (27%) for young adults, and 4 (36%) each for children and older adults.

            "text": "This study offers data on viral infections associated with outpatient ARI in the US during the winter influenza season, using the eSensor 18 virus panel currently available in Europe. This panel of viruses is an expanded version that includes several viruses not part of the FDA-cleared format, that is, the four CoVs and four PIVs. The test involves bioelectronic detection of viral DNA amplified from nucleic acid extracted from the specimen by a conventional RT-PCR assay.18 The assay compares favorably to singleplex RT-PCR in test characteristics, albeit A(H3N2) was the predominant strain in the year tested, yielding little information on the other strains.5 Study limitations include coverage of a single season when influenza was notably light in Pittsburgh and when A(H3N2) predominated, and inability to test an inclusive sample of all of the ARI specimens with the MRT-PCR. However, the sample size was sufficient to allow confidence in the relationships between characteristics of ARI cases and the viruses associated with them during this time period. Additionally, the viral panel does not contain bacteria, mycoplasma, and all possible respiratory viruses, and some viruses could occur more frequently in other seasons.",
