LRIs are composed of bacterial or viral infections occurring below the larynx and encompass bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia.1 ARIs are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children,2\u20134 accounting for >18% of all childhood deaths globally.5 In 2010, there were approximately 120 million episodes and 1.3 million deaths associated with pneumonia worldwide, the vast majority of these occurred in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.5 6 In low-income and middle-income countries, ARIs in children aged <5 years are generally more severe than in older children and adults, resulting in a higher case-fatality than in high-income countries respectively.1 7 This disparity in mortality rate is multifactorial and associated with differing aetiological agents, available therapies, exposure frequencies and host immunity.",

There are at least one local (district) hospital in each district, which serves both outpatients and inpatients of all ages. However, most local hospitals, especially those in urban districts receive mostly adult outpatients. There are two central hospitals (CH1 and CH2) that specialise in serving the paediatric population in HCMC. Another further central hospital (HTD) specialises in infectious diseases and also receives paediatric patients. While paediatric outpatients in HCMC may choose to visit local or private healthcare facilities or tertiary hospitals, most paediatric patients requiring hospitalisation in HCMC are referred or self-referred to one of the three study hospitals.

A Poisson generalised linear model was used to explore the relationship between district ARI incidence and district characteristics.

Pollution was shown to be associated with an increase in LRI incidence in study conducted by the Collaborative Working Group on Air Pollution, Poverty and Health in HCMC.26 The number of beds in these tertiary hospitals did not increase over the study period, and the policy of these hospitals is to accommodate all patients visiting the hospitals regardless of the capacity of the hospital and staff. An increase in ARI admission indicates an increase in burden for these tertiary hospitals and an increased workload for healthcare, which may impact negatively on the quality of care.

Furthermore, we additionally noted a difference in seasonal patterns of URIs (two small peaks a year) and LRIs (one strong peak a year) and a difference in association patterns with climatic factors of URIs and LRIs. These findings suggested that climatic factors might differentially influence the pathogens causing URIs and LRIs in HCMC. The association of URI incidence with 1-week and 3-week lags of weekly average humidity was consistent with the association between the seasonality of absolute humidity and ILI in Vietnam as previously reported.27 In addition, the national surveillance of influenza and ILI in Vietnam during the study period exhibited a similar seasonal pattern with two peaks a year at approximately the same months with the two peaks of URIs in our data.28 The exceptional high peak of URIs without a concurrent peak of LRIs in 2009 also occurred simultaneously with 2009 H1N1. Therefore, influenza and ILI were likely key contributors to the seasonality and the peaks of URIs in our data. Moreover, a study conducted at CH2 investigating viral ARI pathogens found that the peak of RSV infections occurred in rainy season (May\u2013November in HCMC). This period included the peak of LRI months and the larger URI peak.10 Furthermore, RSV is also thought to predispose infected hosts to bacterial infections.29 In addition, a sharp increase of LRI incidence was observed soon after the peak of URIs (May\u2013June) suggests that URIs and LRIs share some common epidemiological features. As a consequence, appropriate treatment and transmission control for URIs may impact on the incidence of later hospitalisation due to LRIs. As the peaks of hospitalisation for LRIs are in September\u2013October, resources for paediatric healthcare should be prepared and local healthcare facilities should be enhanced to share the increase in hospitalisation caused by LRIs at tertiary hospitals during this period.",

            "text": "We found that ARIs accounted for one-third of total hospital admission and were the leading cause of hospitalisation in children in HCMC, Vietnam. The spatial distribution of hospitalised ARIs was similar to the spatial referral patterns of the study hospitals with high incidences in the districts surrounding the locations of the three study hospitals and also in three districts further out the city. The seasonality of ARIs may be explained by the association of ARI incidence with various climatic factors (temperature, humidity and rainfall) and the seasonality of influenza, ILI and RSV. The increase of LRI incidence soon after the peak of URIs suggests that URIs and LRIs share common epidemiological factors or LRIs are complications of URIs. Understanding the spatial distribution, temporal patterns and climatic risk factors of ARIs should aid the health authorities in outbreak preparation and assist in allocating resources for the prevention and control of the diseases, especially in settings where vaccines for viral and bacterial pathogens of ARIs are not routinely available.",
