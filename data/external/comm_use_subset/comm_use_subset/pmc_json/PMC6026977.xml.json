T. gondii not only induces chronic infection in various sites of human body, but it also causes brain infection through the central nervous system as zoonotic parasitosis. In addition, T. gondii has unique infectious subcellular organelles, including apicoplast, conoid, rhoptries, dense granules, and micronemes [1]. In general, T. gondii forms a unique proliferative membrane, such as a parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) including reticular network (RN) during its proliferation after invasion into host cells, and grows in it [2]. Until recently, several drugs were developed to inhibit T. gondii, and they are being used to treat toxoplasmosis\u2019 patients in the clinic. However, their side effects are still clear in the clinic, and it is also being exposed to drug-resistance gradually [3,4,5]. In these aspects, pyrimethamine used for treating toxoplasmosis blocks the synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by effectively inhibiting the dihydrofolate reductase in T. gondii, which inhibits consistently synthesis of the DNA and/or RNA in the proliferation of protozoa species, including malaria.

Although various extracts derived from traditional medicinal plants and its natural compounds were reported to indicate anti-T. gondii activities/effects [12,13,14,15,16], an effective drug of the next generation for the treatment of toxoplasmosis caused by T. gondii has not yet been developed through the clinical study. Furthermore, despite various efforts for developing anti-parasitic drugs, zoonotic parasitosis derived from parasites has been consistently worsening a crisis of the public health worldwide.",

            "text": "In this aspect, various researches for discovering effective drugs against toxoplasmosis, and studies on new substances of relatively low toxicity with safety are urgently required to inhibit zoonosis. Ursolic acid is a bioactive substance contained in various medicinal plants that are used as natural resources in oriental medicine and in folk medicine, and is also known to have a variety of effects and bioactivity, such as anxiolytic activity [17], anti-angiogenic activity [18], and antiepileptic effect [19]. Furthermore, ursolic acid effectively induces extensive bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory [20,21], anticancer [22,23,24], antioxidant [25], antimicrobial [26], and anti-tubercular effects [27], as well as causes strong inhibitory effects against arthritic [28] and autoimmune disease [29]. These studies show that ursolic acid not only induces various physiological activities in both \u201cin vitro\u201d and \u201cin vivo\u201d, but also has the possibility as an anti-parasitic candidate drug. However, studies regarding anti-T. gondii activity of ursolic acid has not been reported yet. In addition, a novel and/or effective drug for the treatment of toxoplasmosis has not been developed yet, even though significant results regarding anti-T. gondii activity have been reported through various studies globally [30,31]. For this reason, this study started from the hypothesis that ursolic acid may effectively inhibit or modulate the proliferation/growth of T. gondii, causing toxoplasmosis in human. This study was carried out to evaluate the anti-T. gondii effect of ursolic acid which is known as a bioactive substance, and to determine its potential as a promising candidate substance for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs.

We evaluated the anti-parasitic activity and the effects of UA on the proliferation and growth of T. gondii using an MTT assay and UA showed the anti-T. gondii activity in the range of 25\u2013200 \u03bcg/mL. T. gondii-infected cells were incubated with different concentrations (25\u2013200 \u03bcg/mL) of UA for 24 h, and their viability was markedly decreased in a dose dependent manner (Table 1 and Table 2). In addition, the UA effectively inhibited the proliferation and growth of T. gondii-infected cells as compared with SF. In particular, T. gondi-infected cells treated with UA (100 \u03bcg/mL) showed a significant decrease of T. gondii including T. gondii fragmentation as well as morphological changes such as cell shrinkage and cell fragmentation when compared with the untreated T. gondii-infected cells (Data not shown), which suggests that UA has anti-parasitic activity and the inhibitory effect against T. gondi in infected cells (Table 2). Furthermore, the UA effectively inhibited the viability of the parasite through the direct inhibition of T. gondii when compared with SF, which is to strongly demonstrate its selective inhibitory effect against T. gondii, and then the parasitic SR was measured at less than 45% at concentrations of 100 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 1). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of UA against T. gondii and T. gondii-infected cells was measured as 94.62 \u03bcg/mL and 162.25 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. These results demonstrate that UA strongly induced anti-proliferation activity of T. gondii in the infected host cells by effectively blocking T. gondii as well as the direct inhibitory action against T. gondii.",

In particular, the formation of PVM is accelerated in a time-dependent manner after cell invasion of T. gondii. For this reason, we investigated the inhibition of PVM that is caused by the interaction between T. gondii and UA during the proliferation stage of T. gondii in host cells. As shown in Figure 2, the PVM formation and nucleus of T. gondii were markedly decreased in T. gondii-infected host cells when it was treated with 100 \u03bcg/mL of UA and SF, respectively, and their changes were clearly observed under a UV fluorescence. The results indicate the inhibitory effect of UA against PVM formation and the viability of T. gondii. Therefore, these results show substantial evidence that UA effectively inhibited or blocked the PVM formed by T. gondii during the proliferative stage as well as the proliferation of T. gondii in the infected host cells after cell invasion.

In this aspect, we evaluated the anti-proliferative effect and the parasitic inhibitory activity of UA against the viability of T. gondii in T. gondii-infected mice. The mice were carefully observed during the experimental periods after the injection of T. gondii treated with 100, 200, and 400 \u03bcg/mL of UA for 24 h. As mentioned above, T. gondii-infected mice treated with different concentrations (200 and 400 \u03bcg/mL) of UA showed higher activity and viability than T. gondii-infected mice, and the mice indicated the dynamic and energetic activity as the normal group. In particular, it clearly confirmed a significant difference of the survival rate between T. gondii-infected mice and the infected mice treated with UA. However, T. gondii-infected mice treated with 100 \u03bcg/mL of UA showed that the effect of UA did not consistently maintain the survival of the infected mice by decreasing after 11.8 days. This result suggests that the death of mice may be owing to tissue damage and cytolysis by invasion of T. gondii than the loss of body weight of mice. Furthermore, symptoms and side effects, such as the loss of body weight, were not observed or induced in all of the groups treated with 200 and 400 \u03bcg/mL of UA for the experimental periods (Figure 3). The result shows effective and clear evidence regarding the effect of anti-T. gondii compounds, which indicates clarity regarding the results as a fusion method for both \u201cin vitro\u201d and \u201cin vivo\u201d. These results demonstrate that UA has the selective anti-parasitic activity which strongly causes anti-T. gondii effects as well as suppressing their viability by effectively inhibiting T. gondii. ",

In particular, the global supporting organizations, including WHO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the global pharmaceuticals are supporting the study for developing novel drugs and for effectively treating or blocking zoonosis such as malaria and tuberculosis, as well as infectious diseases, including AIDS, Zika, Ebola, MERS, and SARS. We should carefully focus on the neglected infectious diseases that are consistently caused through various pathways and infection factors. From these perspectives, T. gondii causes to fetus serious infectious diseases such as retinochoroiditis, hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcification through fetus infection during pregnancy, as well as induces symptoms, such as lymphadenopathy and meningoencephalitis in brain through acquired infection as a zoonotic parasite that is infected in both human and animals. It also induces serious complications in immune deficient patients and HIV patients as one of the infectious parasites that induce parasitic zoonosis, which may induce the interaction for parasitic proliferation and growth through parasitic relationship such as symbiosis in the host. In this aspect, T. gondii not only inhibits defensive mechanisms of cytokines, such as IL-2, -4, -6, -8, and IFN-\u03b3 released from host cells after invasion, but also suppresses the production of protective systems that are activated through the immune-response. Furthermore, it is known to block the signaling transport pathways that activate anti-parasitic system and the resistance to T. gondii invasion in host cells, as well as to suppress the apoptotic signals and cell arrest pathways during the early apoptotic stage of host cells after cell invasion [32,33]. Moreover, T. gondii promotes inactivation of cell cycle initiators and apoptotic mediators during the proliferative phase of T. gondii by forming PVM of T. gondii in host cells, which rapidly accelerates the proliferation of T. gondii in PVM [34].",

In the present study, the expression of PVM in the infected host cells was significantly increased when compared with T. gondii-infected cells treated with UA and SF, and uninfected cells. On the other hand, the proliferation of T. gondii and PVM were markedly inhibited in T. gondii-infected cells treated with UA compared with T. gondii-infected cells. In addition, we evaluated the anti-T. gondii activity of UA through T. gondii-infected mice. After the injection of T. gondii treated with UA (200 and 400 \u03bcg/mL), the mice showed the vitality and the viability such as the uninfected control group without the loss of body weight and the cytotoxicity during the experiment. In particular, it was recently reported that UA has the anti-protozoa effects against Leishmania amazonesis and Leishmania infantums, causing leishmaniasis among the neglected tropical diseases, and its mechanism of action is associated with programmed cell death and nitric oxide (NO) production [35,36]. In this aspect, the anti-T. gondii effect of UA suggests that UA may induce the anti-proliferation and the growth inhibitory action of T. gondii through the mechanism of action that is caused by nitric oxide (NO) production or programmed cell death in T. gondii and the infected host cells.",
