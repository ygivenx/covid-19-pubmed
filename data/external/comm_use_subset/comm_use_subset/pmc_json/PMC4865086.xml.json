            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) consist of four species (HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43) and are associated with a wide variety of clinical presentations. In otherwise healthy children, HCoVs typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections, whereas in premature infants and children with chronic underlying diseases they may cause severe lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis [1\u20134]. However, the role of HCoVs in severe disease is unclear because they are frequently co-detected with other respiratory viruses, most often with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [4, 5]. Among four species of HCoVs, NL63 was found to be more frequently associated with croup than the other three species [6\u20138], whereas NL63 and HKU1 were associated with bronchiolitis and wheezing [6, 8\u201314]. Previous studies also suggested an association between HCoVs and involvement of the gastrointestinal and central nervous system. Almost half of patients with HCoVs respiratory infections report abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea [15\u201317], and HCoVs were detected in some patients with symptoms/signs limited to the gastrointestinal tract. Infections with 229E and OC43 have been implicated in the development of various chronic neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis [18]; OC43 was demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid of a child presumed to have acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [19]; and HKU1 has been associated with febrile seizures [12].",

Children with more than one clinical manifestation (i.e., AB and AGE) were classified under the diagnosis that had been the main reason for hospital admission. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and blood samples were obtained upon admission and at a follow-up visit 14 days after initial sampling. In children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission to hospital. In an individual patient only one sample from the particular source was taken at each of the two time points.

In this study we determined the occurrence of the viruses by molecular method in NP swab and stool samples and tried to assess their etiological role in children under 6 years of age that were hospitalized for AB, AGE, or FS. For the appraisal of the causal relationship we: i) included a control group and compared the frequency of HCoVs in patients with their occurrence in healthy children; ii) searched for the presence of several other viruses that might also be the cause of the illness, and iii) determined the estimated viral load of HCoV nucleic acids present (measured as Ct value), based on the idea that a high viral load (low Ct value) more reliably suggests a causative role than a low viral load (high Ct value).",

The proportion of positive results was the highest in children with FS (9.9%), followed by AGE (8.7%) and AB (6.5%), but the differences between the three groups were not statistically significant. HCoVs were more often detected in NP swabs of patients than in healthy controls (8.1% versus 1.9%, OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4 to 14.5, P = 0.01). The same was valid also for all three clinical groups (FS, AGE, AB). Although these findings support the causal role of HCoVs in our patients, this role remained inconclusive due to frequent co-detection of other viruses. Namely, in 36 (62.1%) of the 58 HCoVs-positive NP samples other respiratory viruses were detected, most commonly RSV (22/36, 61.1%). Within HCoVs NP swab-positive patients those with AB had the largest probability of being \u201cco-infected\u201d with other viruses (19/20, 95%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%). The fraction of \u201cco-infections\u201d established in our patients with FS and AGE is similar to that reported previously [12, 15\u201317, 33, 34], whereas the proportion in children with AB is higher than in most other studies [35\u201339]. NP swab HCoVs estimated viral load was the highest in patients with FS (median Ct value 27.8), followed by AGE (median Ct value 29.5) and AB (median Ct value 33.5). Viral load in single HCoV \u201cinfections\u201d was higher than in \u201cco-infections\u201d (median Ct values 27.5 versus 32, respectively; P = 0.09). This finding is in contrast to previous studies, in which no difference in viral load in single HCoV \u201cinfections\u201d and \u201cco-infections\u201d was found [34].",

These findings suggest that HCoVs play only a minor role in gastrointestinal illness in children under 6 years old and go in parallel with the results of a Finnish study, in which HCoVs were more commonly detected in NP swabs than in stool samples in children with AGE, children with respiratory infection, and the group with combined gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms [40].",
