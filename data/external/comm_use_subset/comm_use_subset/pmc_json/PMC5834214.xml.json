            "text": "Mammarenaviruses (Arenaviridae: Mammarenavirus) cause chronic infections of rodents worldwide [1]. Invasion of human dwellings by infected rodents can result in human infections through mucosal exposure to aerosols or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious material. Several mammarenaviruses cause viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in humans and pose important public health problems in their endemic areas [2\u20136]. Mammarenaviruses are classified into two main groups, Old World (OW) and New World (NW) [1]. The OW Lassa virus (LASV), causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), is the most significant OW mammarenaviral pathogen. LASV is estimated to infect several hundred thousand individuals annually in Western Africa, resulting in a high number of LF cases associated with high morbidity and lethality. Moreover, LASV endemic regions are expanding [7], and the association of the recently identified mammarenavirus Lujo virus with a VHF outbreak in Southern Africa [8, 9] has raised concerns about the emergence of novel VHF-causing mammarenaviruses. The most significant NW mammarenavirus is Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), which causes Argentinian hemorrhagic fever [10]. The worldwide-distributed OW mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance especially in congenital infections [11\u201315]. Moreover, LCMV poses a particular threat to immunocompromised individuals, as has been illustrated by fatal cases of LCMV infection associated with organ transplants [16, 17]. However, LCMV research can be safely performed at BSL-2 containment, rather than the BSL-4 containment necessary for live LASV or JUNV research [18].",

The S RNA segment encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein precursor (GPC). GPC is co-translationally cleaved by signal peptidase to generate a stable signal peptide (SSP) and is post-translationally processed by site 1 protease (S1P) to generate the mature virion surface glycoproteins GP1 and GP2. These mature glycoproteins together with SSP form the GP complex that mediates virion receptor recognition and cell entry. The L RNA segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix really interesting new gene (RING) finger protein Z, which is bona fide matrix protein analogous to those found in many negative-sense RNA viruses [22, 23].",

A primary role of NP is to encapsidate the viral genomic and antigenomic RNAs to form the nucleocapsid templates. These templates together with L form the virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that is responsible for directing the biosynthetic processes of virus RNA replication and gene transcription. In addition, the C-terminal region of NP contains distinct functional domains involved in interaction with Z, which regulates viral RNA synthesis and may facilitate virion budding [24]. NP also counteracts the host-cell type I interferon (IFN-I) response to infection by blocking the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) through the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) pathway [25, 26]. NP's IFN-I antagonistic activity has been associated with the 3'-5' exoribonuclease functional domain of the DEDDh family located within the NP carboxyl-terminus [25, 27\u201331]. In addition, amino acid residues located outside the enzyme active site critically contribute to the anti-INF-I activity of the NP of the New World mammarenavirus Tacaribe (TCRV) [32]",

To fill this knowledge gap and identify potential novel host-cell targets that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes, we generated a recombinant LCMV encoding a Strep-tagged NP (rLCMV/Strep-NP) to capture the NP-interactome in LCMV-infected cells. Our proteomics approach combined with genetics and pharmacological studies identified ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) and prohibitin (PHB) as pro-viral factors. Use of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down and pharmacological inhibitors of ATP1A1 and PHB reduced virus multiplication significantly. Cell-based assays revealed that inhibitors of ATP1A1 and PHB targeted different steps of the virus life cycle. Accordingly, we observed a synergistic inhibitory effect on LCMV multiplication using inhibitors to ATP1A1 and PHB. Importantly, ATP1A1 inhibitors (cardiac glycosides), which are currently being used in the clinic, suppressed multiplication of LASV and JUNV, suggesting that the requirement of ATP1A1 for LCMV multiplication is conserved among genetically distantly related mammarenaviruses. Thus, repurposing cardiac glycosides to treat infections by human pathogenic arenaviruses may be possible.",

            "text": "Plasmid-mediated expression of viral genes in transfected cells has been often used successfully to identify virus-host-cell protein-protein interactions (VH PPI). However, this approach has the potential problem that overexpression of a single viral gene product may potentiate PPI interactions that are not relevant during the course of a natural virus infection. To overcome this issue, we designed a recombinant LCMV (rLCMV) encoding a tandem [WSHPQFEK(GGGS)3WSHPQFEK] Strep-tag fused to the amino-terminus of NP (rLCMV/Strep-NP) (Fig 1A and 1B). To facilitate the identification of specific PPI between NP and host cell proteins, we used our mammarenavirus tri-segmented (r3) platform [30] to design an r3LCMV expressing a C-terminus Strep-tag version of enhanced green fluorescent protein (r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep) that we used as a negative control (Fig 1A and 1B). We rescued rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep and confirmed the expression of strep-tagged NP and eGFP in rLCMV/Strep-NP- and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep-infected cells, respectively (Fig 1C). Next, we examined the growth properties of rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep in three different cells lines from hamsters, humans, and nonhuman primates (BHK-21, A549, and Vero E6 cells, respectively) (Fig 1D). The fitness of rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep was modestly decreased compared to that observed with wild-type (WT) Armstrong (rLCMV ARM) and Clone 13 (rLCMV Cl-13) strains of LCMV. However, both rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep had WT-like growth kinetics and reached high titers. As with WT LCMV, infection with rLCMV/Strep-NP prevented production of bioactive IFN-I by cells in response to Sendai virus (SeV) infection as determined using an IFN bioassay based on protection against the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Fig 1E). Vero cells treated for 16 h with tissue cultured supernatants (TCS) from A549 cells infected first with WT LCMV or rLCMV/Strep, followed by 24 h infection with SeV, remained fully susceptible to VSV- induced CPE. In contrast, Vero cells treated with TCS from A549 cells infected with rLCMV/NP(D382A), a mutant unable to prevent induction of IFN-I [30], and subsequently with SeV, were protected against VSV induced CPE.",

Filtering the data using these criteria resulted in identification of 139 candidate host-cell proteins as NP-interacting partners. Among 53 proteins found present in both NP- and eGFP-PD samples, 36 had spectral counts in the NP-PD sample that were less than two-fold higher than their corresponding spectral counts in the eGFP-PD sample (Fig 2C and S1 Table). Based on the criteria we described above, we considered these proteins to be highly unlikely specific NP-interactors with an involvement in the LCMV life cycle, and therefore we did not consider these hits for further analysis.

The siRNAs we used were from the genome-wide ON TARGET-Plus (OTP) Human siRNA library (18,301 genes, 4 siRNAs/gene). OTPs are latest generation of siRNAs and offer significant advantages over previous generations. Off-target effects are primarily driven by antisense strand microRNA (miR)-like seed activity. In OTPs, the sense strand is modified to favor antisense strand uptake whereas the antisense strand seed region is modified to drastically reduce seed-related off-targeting [33]. In addition, OTPs are designed on the foundation of the SMARTselection algorithm (Dharmacon), widely considered to be the best algorithm for rational siRNA design strategy. Numerous host-cell factors showed an anti-LCMV effect (increased ZsG expression by kd of the genes), including microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) [34], which has been shown to inhibit multiplication of other viruses. Host-cell factors exhibiting pro-viral activity (decreased ZsG expression by kd of the gene) included ATP1A1 and PHB, which are involved in multiplication of a variety of viruses including Ebola virus [35], coronaviruses [36], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [37], influenza A virus (FLUAV) subtype H5N1 [38], dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) [39], and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [40].",

We confirmed that cells transfected with siRNA specific to ATP1A1 and PHB exhibited the predicted reduced levels in ATP1A1 and PHB protein expression (Fig 3B). Likewise, we examined whether siRNA-mediated reduced expression levels of ZsGreen correlated with reduced LCMV progeny titers. For this, we transfected A549 cells with siRNA targeting ATP1A1 or with NC siRNA 72 h prior to infection with rLCMV/ZsG. We found that siRNA-mediated kd of ATP1A1 dramatically inhibited ZsGreen expression (Fig 3Ci), which was associated with a significant reduction of infectious LCMV progeny (Fig 3Cii). Our attempts to see interaction between NP and ATP1A1 or NP and PHB by co-immunoprecipitation were unsuccessful. Several possibilities could account for this, including interactions of low affinity or high on/off rate or both. Another consideration is that only a minor fraction of NP might be engaged in the interaction with a given host cell protein, and therefore, detection of these interactions would require highly sensitive methods such as LC-MS/MS. To overcome this problem we used confocal microscopy to examine the co-localization of NP with ATP1A1 and PHB in LCMV-infected cells. Weighted co-localization coefficients (CC), determined by taking into consideration the brightness of each channel signal, were significantly higher than non-weighted CC, indicating the presence of brighter pixels in the co-localized regions compared to the non-co-localized regions (Fig 4).",

To examine whether pharmacological inhibition of ATP1A1 or PHB inhibited LCMV multiplication, we pretreated human (A549 and HEK 293T), nonhuman primate (Vero E6), and rodent (murine L929 and hamster BHK-21) cells with ouabain or rocaglamide and infected them with rLCMV/eGFP (S1 Fig). Ouabain treatment resulted in a strong dose-dependent inhibition of eGFP expression in infected human- and nonhuman primate cells, but did not affect eGFP expression intensity in infected rodent cells (S1A Fig).

Ouabain had TIs of 4.99 (CC50 = 28.9 nM, IC50 = 5.79 nM [log10\u22128.237M]) and 3.81 (CC50 = 70.0 nM, IC50 = 18.4 nM) in A549 and Vero E6 cells, respectively (Fig 5Bi); whereas rocaglamide had TIs of >105 (CC50 > 1000 nM, IC50 = 9.51 nM) and 10.3 (CC50 = 100 nM, IC50 = 9.75 nM) in A549 and Vero E6 cells, respectively (Fig 5Bii). Moreover, the ATP1A1 antagonist inhibitor, bufalin, also exhibited robust anti-LCMV activity with TIs of 8.92 (CC50 = 16.4 nM, IC50 = 1.85 nM) and 5.90 (CC50 = 73.8 nM, IC50 = 12.5 nM) in A549 and Vero E6 cells, respectively (S2 Fig). Multiplication of vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV) was not significantly affected by either ouabain (10 nM) or rocaglamide (100 nM) (Fig 5C), further supporting a specific anti-LCMV activity of ouabain and rocaglamide that was not due to reduced cell viability.",

First, we asked whether ouabain and rocaglamide affected cell entry of LCMV. We conducted time-of-addition experiments in which we treated cells with ouabain or rocaglamide prior to virus inoculation (-1.5 h), at the time of inoculation (0 h), or 1.5 h pi (+1.5 h) (Fig 6A). In some samples, we used ammonium chloride starting at 4 h pi to block multiple rounds of virus infection. The timing of compound addition did not significantly change the number of eGFP-positive cells, indicating that neither ouabain nor rocaglamide inhibited cell entry of LCMV. The number of eGFP+ cells in ouabain-treated cells was reduced at all time-of-addition points compared to vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells, but was similar to that observed in ammonium chloride-treated cells. Thus, ouabain did not inhibit LCMV RNA replication and gene expression, but rather a late step of the LCMV life cycle. In contrast, rocaglamide treatment resulted in a negligible number of eGFP+ cells, indicating that rocaglamide inhibited virus RNA replication and gene transcription.",

At 24 h, we determined by WB levels of Z protein in both whole cell lysates and associated with virus-like particles (VLPs) collected from TCS. Treatment with rocaglamide, but not with ouabain, caused a reduction in both LCMV and LASV Z budding efficiency (Fig 6C and 6D). The reproducibility of these findings was confirmed based on results from four independent experiments (Fig 6E). We also examined whether ouabain could interfere with a step of assembly of infectious progeny that was not captured by the Z budding assay through two additional experiments. The first experiment involved the use of a newly generated single-cycle infectious recombinant LCMV expressing the reporter gene ZsGreen (scrLCMV/ZsG-P2A-NP) to infect (MOI = 0.1) A549 cells (1st infection).

These experimental conditions overcome concerns about potential artifactual interactions due to plasmid-mediated overexpression of a single viral protein in transfected cells. Infection with live virus can also overcome the technical complications of transfection efficiency of plasmid-based expression systems, which limits the cell types that can be used to define viral protein interactomes.

Differences in both experimental conditions and analysis methodologies used to generate the LCMV NP interactome documented by King et al. and ours likely contributed to the observed differences between data sets. Despite progress in the implementation of global proteomics-based screens to identify virus-host protein-protein interactions, overlap between datasets for the same viral system is usually limited. However, the substantial overlap of 99 of the 171 NP-interacting proteins from both studies supports the overall reliability of both systems. We used results of the eGFP-Strep interactome, determined in r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep-infected cells, as a control to filter out non-specific NP interactions, which may have resulted in a higher degree of stringency than in the study by King et al for selection of NP-interacting candidates.

We, as well as the work by King et al. [45], did not detect this NP-IKK\u03b5 interaction. This discrepancy may have been caused by very low expression of IKK\u03b5 in LCMV-infected cells, which prevented detection of IKK\u03b5 by LC-MS/MS. Alternatively, NP-IKK\u03b5 interaction could possibility be temporarily regulated and take place at early times pi, but could be mostly absent at 48 h pi, the time at which we prepared the cell lysates for our proteomics studies.

Thus, a low concentration of ouabain induces a conformational change in ATP1A1 that results in activation and release of proto-oncogene tyrosine protein kinase, Src, from ATP1A1, followed by activation of as yet unknown downstream signaling that inhibits, for instance, cell entry of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [59]. However, our results indicated that ouabain did not interfere with LCMV cell entry. In addition, treatment with the Src inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP1) did not counteract the anti-LCMV activity of ouabain (S4 Fig). Nevertheless, ATP1A1-mediated Src signaling could plausibly contribute to the inhibitory effect of ouabain on JUNV multiplication as similarly to that observed with MHV. Moreover, cell entry of JUNV occurs also by clathrin-mediated endocytosis [60], a process affected by Src signaling. Ouabain has been clinically used in several European countries for the management of congestive heart failure, whereas bufalin has been tested in clinical trials for cancer treatments [61], and the CST digoxin has been FDA-approved since 1997 to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Hence, opportunities for the repurposing CSTs have potential as therapeutics to treat infections caused by viral hemorrhagic fever-causing arenaviruses.",

Rather, PHB contributed to HCV cell entry through binding to cellular RAF (c-Raf; proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase) and subsequent Harvey rat sarcoma proto-oncogene (HRas) activation that induces a signal transduction pathway required for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated HCV cell entry [37].

MOV10 was shown to enhance IRF-3-mediated IFN-I induction following SeV infection through a tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-independent and IKK\u03b5-dependent manner. This finding was further supported by demonstrating MOV10-IKK\u03b5 interaction by co-immunoprecipitation studies [73].

An rLCMV lacking GPC and expressing eGFP (rLCMV\u0394GPC/eGFP) was generated by reverse genetics using procedures previously described [84]. rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep were generated by reverse genetics using similar procedures to generate WT rLCMV and tri-segmented LCMV (r3LCMV) expressing eGFP [30]. For the generation of these novel rLCMVs, we created pol1S Cl-13 plasmids that directed Pol1-mediated intracellular synthesis of recombinant LCMV S genome RNA species coding for Strep-tagged NP or eGFP, respectively (Fig 1A and 1B). The rLCMV expressing eGFP (rLCMV/eGFP) was generated as described [85], and the rLCMV expressing ZsGreen (rLCMV/ZsG) instead of eGFP was generated by reverse genetics using similar procedures to generate rLCMV/eGFP. Generation of rLASV expressing eGFP (rLASV/eGFP) will be described elsewhere. A tri-segmented recombinant live-attenuated Candid #1 strain of JUNV expressing eGFP (r3JUNV/eGFP) was generated as described [86]. For the generation of a novel single cycle rLCMV expressing ZsGreen (scrLCMV/ZsG-P2A-NP), a pol1S plasmid was created by omitting GPC open reading frame (ORF) from pol1S plasmid used for the generation of rLCMV/ZsG. scrLCMV/ZsG-P2A-NP was rescued by reverse genetics using similar procedures to generate rLCMV\u0394GPC/eGFP [84].",

Total cell lysate was prepared by lysing the cells with lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 50 mM of Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 62.5 mM NaCl, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate). After clarification of TCS from cell debris by centrifugation at 400 x g and 4\u00b0C for 10 min, VLPs were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g and 4\u00b0C for 30 min through a 20% sucrose cushion. VLPs were resuspended in PBS, and Z expression in total cell lysate and TCS (containing VLPs) were analyzed by western blots.",
