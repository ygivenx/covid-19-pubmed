The threat of new and re-emerging infectious diseases is increasingly recognised as one of the more likely and potentially devastating events that humanity could face in the coming decades.1 Despite their disproportionate share of disease burden in terms of morbidity and mortality in some parts of the world, communicable infectious diseases are not only the concern of developing countries.2 Malaria, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)/AIDS, tuberculosis, dengue fever, and West Nile fever still affect a large number of Asian, American, and European countries. In addition, over the past 2 or 3 decades, western and developed countries have faced growing threats from vector-borne emerging infectious diseases (EID) such as chikungunya fever, dengue fever, West Nile fever, and Lyme disease.3\u20135 Urbanisation, climate change, globalisation, migration, and other socio-ecological factors are recognised as primary conditions that could lead to possible large-scale outbreaks of arboviral diseases.6\u20138 For most diseases caused by these viruses, there is no available treatment or vaccine, and populations in developed coun-tries have not experienced them at epidemic levels. Even though no large-scale epidemics have occurred yet in Europe, recent alerts have brought to light the risk of mosquito-borne infectious diseases.9, 10 For example, a major epidemic of chikungunya fever was recently narrowly avoided in Italy.11\n",

Nevertheless, whatever the availability of scientific knowledge and the quality of its implementation into public health programmes, successful response rests, to a large extent, on the relevance of the behaviours adopted by the exposed populations. In other words, the more accurately the public evaluates the risk and complies with public health recommendations, the smaller the amplitude of the epidemic and its harmful consequences tend to be. From this perspective, understanding how and why the public perceives and reacts to the threat of an EID\u2014what determines the pattern and distribution of protective behaviours\u2014 represents one of the most crucial challenges both in terms of scientific knowledge and in terms of health and socioeconomic impacts.",

Paradoxically, little is known about changes in perception and behaviour induced by sudden large-scale epidemics in developed countries. This gap in understanding could be explained by the fact that such epidemics have been absent from developed countries for a long time.

The surveys were conducted either by phone or face-to-face (Table 1). To identify those who were infected on the three islands (the dependent variable to be explained), we used two kinds of tools.

On the other hand, in terms of perception and behaviour, reduced infection risk was associated with perceiving the controllability of the disease, the usefulness of personal protection, and frequently using mosquito-repellent sprays (Table 3). This finding was roughly the same in Mayotte, where the population had the same attack rate from the infection by the end of the epidemic. The same socio-demographic and psycho-cognitive factors were found to be significantly associated with chikungunya fever in Mayotte, with the exception of place of origin (migrants were more likely to be infected compared with the native population), and a lack of impact from individual protective behaviours. It should be noted here that the majority of migrants in La R\u00e9union originate from European territories, whereas those in Mayotte come from poorer territories (mainly from the Comoros Islands and Madagascar).",

The general framework starts with an invisible change in the environment of the populations concerned. In the case of an arboviral disease outbreak, the change would be denoted by an acquired competency of a vector to become a carrier and a transmitter of a virus. Given that mosquitoes have been present for a long time and are perceived as harmless by the public in affected areas, recognising them as the causal agent takes time, and this new perception is not uniformly shared. So, when a new infection is emerging, the perceived risk of contracting it through mosquito bites is hidden by the lack of a noticeable change in the familiar environment of the population. This represents the starting point common to most infectious disease outbreaks. After a certain amount of time, despite the fact that the causal agent and its routes of transmission are well and publicly recognised, a subset of the public continues to perceive the risk of infection as unreal, inconsistent, or too costly to prevent. In this general scenario, the outcome of the out-break is made apparent through the spread of the infection among the exposed population. Identifying the main factors that drive the spread, their interdependencies, and their relative weight represent both a generic objective for any infectious disease outbreak response and a key piece of information that can be used to adapt and improve infection control.",

In the case of an arboviral disease outbreak, the exposure to the viral agent is made visible thanks to its carriage by mosquitoes. The exposure to mosquito bites in the three islands studied, although difficult to assess accurately, is assumed to be uniform across the population given the wide spatial distribution of the vector and also given the shared housing conditions. (3) The level of individual protection that could reduce the effects of the natural exposure and seems to be the primary factor that can discriminate between infected and uninfected individuals. Thus, when differences are observed in socio-cognitive factors and are associated with behavioural consequences, they are expected to play a causal role in the final outcome, which is defined as \u2018infected\u2019 or \u2018infection-free\u2019 individuals.35 In the events we studied, that was clearly the case only in La R\u00e9union, where a perception of having behavioural control over the risk and a belief in the usefulness of personal protection measures were significantly associated with use of repellent sprays, and finally with having infection-free status.",

In other words, as no significant difference in the level of actual individual protection was found, the distribution of dengue fever, which varies between socio-demographic groups, would be primarily determined by the distribution of the natural exposure modified by collective protection measures against mosquito bites (pest and larval control campaigns). This hypothesis is consistent with the surprising and uncommon socio-demographic variables characterising the group most likely to be infected in La Martinique. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis, particularly by introducing data about the geographical allocation of pest control interventions and some evaluation of their impact.",

The level of protection adopted by the exposed individuals represents not only the main determinant of the clinical outcome but also the main factor that can be easily influenced by new infection control programmes. From this perspective, the first major lesson drawn from the results of these surveys concerns the distribution of risk perception.36 Individual levels of risk perception represent an important point to investigate through its key variables: perceived likelihood of infection, perceived severity of the disease, and perceived self-efficacy.37 When the threat is perceived to be serious, as shown by a high perceived susceptibility and severity, it becomes a condition that can lead (or not) to an effective change in behaviour. The perceived threat seems to be different in the case of chikungunya fever outbreaks compared with the case of dengue fever epidemic/endemic situations studied. In the first case, the protective behaviour indicated by the health status was found to be associated with perceived controllability of the disease and perceived usefulness of personal protection, an outcome of risk perception.38 In the case of dengue fever, the distribution of risk perception does not seem to be associated either with protective behaviour or with health status. Whatever the role and impact of risk perception, there is a need for cognitive and perception- oriented studies of the exposed population in large-scale infectious outbreaks.",

It could be expressed through a judgement call, an intention to change behaviour, or an actual (or the absence of) behavioural change.

After a certain amount of time, when the threat becomes better understood and familiar, the fear triggered by the novelty of the threat is superseded by a process of normalisation, posing the question of how high-risk perception and protective behaviours can be maintained sustainably in endemic contexts. This phenomenon of relapse, well identified in long-term epidemics of disease such as HIV/AIDS,41 enables one to explain, at least partly, the paradoxical findings in Martinique. Despite a good understanding of the disease and a consensus on the efficacy of the main protective tools available, people do not use them enough to be protected. Thus, endemic disease can be viewed as a particularly challenging context for successfully implementing risk-reduction strategies because of the difficulty of ensuring sustainable protection. The challenge is to translate this finding into relevant risk management and communication approaches.",

            "text": "Two different strategic options can be proposed for managing the risk of long-lasting outbreaks of disease, such as dengue fever. The first option is to attempt to convince people to protect themselves as long as the virus is circulating, regardless of the context, that is, endemic or epidemic disease. Our results show that this objective seems very difficult to achieve and is probably unrealistic in the case of permanent or long-term health threats. Study of sustainable health-protective behaviour indicates that numerous difficulties make this aim unachievable.13 However, an alternative option would be to adopt a flexible and targeted strategy: compliance to an effective protection measure would be asked in accordance with the level of viral exposure. The aim would be to achieve behavioural change limited to a temporary, but real protection, when the level of circulating virus is critical, as opposed to seeking an inaccessible and permanent degree of protection that is considered too costly for the vast majority of the population. This strategy would permit one to take into consideration the ratio of the two main components of risk reduction: benefits expected from a temporary protection and the level of exposure. In the case of a mosquito-borne virus, the higher the level of exposure the lower the probability of remaining healthy without adopting intensive, daily protection measures. In contrast, the benefits of having permanent protection during low levels of exposure are poor, because the risk of infection through mosquito bites is minor. This flexible strategy related to exposure enables one to better address the low capacity to sustain long-term and efficient individual protection in a cyclical context. The experience of the chikungunya outbreak in La R\u00e9union indicates that the proportion of the population who protected themselves effectively during a short period reduced their risk of infection. However, two conditions are needed for this strategy to succeed in an endemic context: one is the capacity to monitor and predict the arrival of a new outbreak,42 another is the ability to rapidly translate the alarm into a strong and convincing communication, as in the case of hurricanes, floods, heat waves, etcetera. From our viewpoint, protection against vector- borne diseases, such as chikungunya or dengue fevers, should benefit considerably from an exposure-related strategy, that is, modulating the fight against mosquitoes according to the level of exposure to the virus. This would improve the efficiency of protection measures and ultimately reduce the rate of infection.",
