Access to such a specimen would be an important advance in the monitoring and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), as well as other lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, asthma, lung cancer, etc. Presently, oropharyngeal (OP), sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are typically used to monitor CF patients. OP specimens may be appropriate for detecting viruses, but are not ideal for most bacterial pathogens. Sputum is commonly collected to monitor CF but often contains contaminants and cystic fibrosis related bacteria (CFRB) from the upper respiratory tract. The difficulty some patients have in producing an acceptable sputum specimen further decreases the value of these samples, often causing the physician to treat the patient empirically\n1\u2013\n4. BAL provides a specimen from the lungs but is an invasive procedure that cannot be routinely used. BAL specimens may also collect contaminants from the upper respiratory tract\n5\u2013\n7.",

The initial volume of air that comes from exhalation or coughing is contaminated air from the upper respiratory tract, also known as anatomic dead space. When a patient coughs into the device, this air from the upper airways first flows into the reservoir (\nFigure 2a). The exhaled air flows to the reservoir first as it has the least resistance compared to the filter at the end of the device. This reservoir has a volume of 250 ml, approximately 100 ml greater than the volume of anatomic dead space in the average adult\n15, which ensures that all of the upper airway aerosols are completely separated out. The expanded reservoir is inelastic, creating a back-pressure, so subsequent exhaled breath is forced through the microbial filter (\nFigure 2b). Therefore, only lung aerosol contents are collected onto the filter and are free from upper airway contamination.",
