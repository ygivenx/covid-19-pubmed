            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly \u00adcontagious vesicular disease of cloven-hoofed animals posing a great threat to the world economy [1]. The disease is caused by FMD virus (FMDV), a highly divergent small RNA virus of the genus Aphthovirus under the family Picornaviridae [2]. There are 7 serotypes of the virus namely O, A, C, Asia-1, SAT-1, SAT-2 and SAT-3. Infection with one serotype does not produce immunity to other serotypes. Among domesticated animals, cattle, buffalo, swine, sheep and goat are susceptible to the disease. African wild buffaloes maintain SAT serotypes of the virus in oropharyngeal region and act as carriers to cloven-hoofed wildlife [3]. The disease is transmitted via contaminated air and fomites or direct contact with infected animal. After infection, the virus replicates rapidly, and viremia occurs within a day. The virus transmission occurs at 0.3-0.7 day before the appearance of clinical signs [4]. Generally, FMD is characterized by formation of vesicles on the feet, buccal mucosa and mammary glands, and drooling of saliva in the form of string. After recovery, the affected animals retain the virus in their oro-pharynx and may act as a carrier for the disease transmission to the susceptible animals.",

FMD viral genome consists of a large single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by highly structured 5\u2019 and 3\u2019untranslated regions (UTR). The 5\u2019 UTR is divided into five elements, S-fragment, poly C tract, pseudo-knots, cis-acting replicative element (cre), and internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The IRES serves for internal initiation of protein \u00adsynthesis in cap-independent manner. The 3\u2019 UTR contains a short stretch of RNA which folds into a specific stem-loop structure [6] of about 90 nucleotides, followed by a poly(A) tract of variable length. Both the UTRs play roles in virus translation and RNA replication. The ORF is translated to single polyprotein, which is subsequently processed by virus-encoded proteases (e.g. 3Cpro) to produce four structural and eight non-structural proteins. These proteins self-assemble to form icosahedral, virus-like particles (VLPs), which contain 60 copies of each structural protein (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) encapsidating the single stranded RNA genome.",

In India, the disease is caused by the serotypes O, A, and Asia-1 among which the serotype O is the most prevalent (93.3%) [7]. Currently, the disease is controlled by vaccination in developing countries while developed countries follow stamping out policy [8]. Inactivated whole virus vaccine has been widely used to control and prevent the disease. However, the preparation of the inactivated virus vaccine requires costly biocontainment facilities, large quantities of live virus and cold chain maintenance, and is associated with risk of escape of the live virus from the vaccine manufacturing unit to the environment and from vaccine due to incomplete activation, and is also not suitable for differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy [1].",

VLPs based vaccine has received a lot of attention and considered one of the most appealing approach for contemporary vaccine design [9] due to their immunogenic properties and high safety profile for vaccine delivery platforms [10]. VLPs have been generated by use of various expression systems like vaccinia virus [11], adenovirus [12], Escherichia coli [13] and baculovirus [14]. VLPs of the FMDV have been produced in vitro by co-expression of P1-2A and 3Cpro [15,16].

FMD molecular vaccine based on replication deficient human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) carrying FMD capsid genes was developed and licensed for use as emergency response tool during any FMD outbreak in the USA [24]. The hAd5 carrying FMDV capsid protein antigen (P1-2A) along with 3Cpro have been tested in mice [17,25], guinea pigs [26], swine [17,26] and cattle [27] to protect them from homologous challenge virus.

The genes of interest (P1-2AB, 3BCwt and 3BCm) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers enlisted in Table-1. All the PCR were performed using a reaction mix containing Phusion HF DNA polymerase (NEB, USA), Phusion buffer, dNTP, primer pair and template cDNA in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystem, USA). P1-2AB PCR was performed with the initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C/5 min, followed by 30 cycles with denaturation at 94\u00b0C/30 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C/30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C/2 min 30 s. Final extension was carried out at 72\u00b0C/10 min. 3BCwt PCR was performed under the same thermal conditions except cyclic extension at 72\u00b0C/1 min and final extension at 72\u00b0C/5 min. Synthesis of 3BCm was carried out in two steps. In the first step, two segments of the 3BCm (3BC1 and 3C2) were synthesized using the mutagenic primers enlisted in Table-1. The amplification of above two segments was carried out with initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C/5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C/30 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C/30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C/30 s. Final extension was carried out at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Then, these two segments were used as a template to synthesize 3BCm as per the PCR program for 3BCwt. All the PCR products were purified by PCR purification kit (Fermentas, USA). All the gene segments mentioned above were digested with SpeI enzyme (NEB, USA). Either the 3BCwt or 3BCm was ligated to P1-2AB by T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific, USA) to construct expression cassettes P1-2AB3BCwt and P1-2AB3BCm. Both the expression cassettes were similar except glycine (G) at position 38 and phenylalanine (F) at position 48 of 3Cwt were replaced with serine (S) in 3Cm.",

Seven serotypes of FMDV with many subtypes in each serotype and no cross-protection against each other make the disease control difficult. Serotype O virus is antigenically poor compared to A and Asia-1 serotypes, and thus large amount of serotype O antigen is required to achieve same level of protection in the inactivated vaccine [32]. Vaccines based on inactivated whole viruses emulsified with adjuvant have been effectively used to control and prevent the disease in enzootic countries. But due to several limitations of the inactivated vaccine, various alternate approaches have been tried to develop a better vaccine candidate [33].",

P1-2A-3C being a basic expression cassette of FMD virion is responsible for empty capsid particle formation [15] while 2B has been reported to induce rapid immune responses [28,29]. In the present study, incorporation of 3B downstream of 2B in the expression cassette provides two additional cleavage sites for 3Cpro besides increasing the genome size of the vector that may reduce the toxicity of 3Cpro to the infected cells. It has been demonstrated that the length of the inserted gene affects the genetic stability of the vector and a genome size <75% or > 105% of the wild-type (wt) genome tends to rearrange to achieve a size closer to wt genome [36,37] and may recombine to the packaging cell line genome to generate replication competent adenovirus. In our study, the genome size of recombinant hAd5 (34.8 kb) was about 91% of the wt genome which is optimum for genome packaging.",

No virus particle was seen at 12 hpi in the HEK-293 cells infected with the recombinant adenoviruses indicating that the whole virus inoculum was adsorbed and the virus particles were in eclipse phase while the presence of virus activity was evident in the cells infected with dAd5. Generation time for the recombinant adenoviruses was recorded as >12 h while for dAd5 it was \u226512 h. The delayed appearance of progeny viruses in the cells infected with recombinant hAd5 viruses may have been due to increased size of the genome compared to dAd5. The growth kinetics of the viruses was found to be similar to those of the previous study involving hAd5 [39] and hAd3 [40]. Maximum growth was recorded during first 48 h which decreased later on which may be due to unavailability of sufficient healthy cells for a further round of virus replication. Our result of thermal stability of the viruses is in agreement with those of previous studies [41,42] and found to be statistically significant. The dAd5 was less stable at 37\u00b0C compared to the recombinant viruses while hAd5/P1-2AB3BCm was more stableat 4\u00b0C as compared to hAd5/P1-2AB3BCwt. In general, the virus titer decreased up to 10-fold at 4\u00b0C and 21-fold at 37\u00b0C after 60 h of incubation. In a study, Xue et al. [40] demonstrated that thermostability of the hAd5 at 45\u00b0C decrease more rapidly.",
