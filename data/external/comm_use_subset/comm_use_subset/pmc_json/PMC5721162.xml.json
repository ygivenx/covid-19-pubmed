            "text": "Arresting the West African Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic of 2013\u20132016 required a significant international intervention and exposed a global vulnerability to emerging epidemics. Advances in genetic-sequencing technologies have enabled the near real-time analysis of infectious pathogen genomes [1\u20133], thereby improving forecasts for emerging epidemics [4,5], enhancing surveillance of endemic diseases [6] and identifying strategies for eradication [7,8]. During the West African EBOV crisis, publicly available data facilitated a series of prominent analyses aimed at identifying basic epidemiological parameters, i.e. the reproductive number [9,10]. Further, the release of EBOV genome data, coupled with phylogenetic methods, provided fundamental insight into the origin and spatial properties of the epidemic [11,12]. Despite the prominent role mathematical and statistical modelling played during the epidemic, there has been a significant delay in characterizing the spatio-temporal spread of EBOV. For future epidemics, the design of operationally relevant, spatially distributed interventions requires the identification of predictive models that are able to assimilate case and genetic data. In this article, we describe how EBOV molecular data, specifically virus genomes, can be used to directly model the spatio-temporal dynamics of the Sierra Leone epidemic.",

Analogous to the attracting force between physical masses, the gravity model describes human movements as dependent on the size of and distance between human populations [16,17]. Other spatial models, such as the well-known, scale-free L\u00e9vy flights, depend solely on travelling distance and have been used to describe a wide-ranging set of phenomena from epidemiology [18], ecology [19] and plasma physics [20].",

However, when the model parameters are fit to country-specific data, their dynamic behaviour can be qualitatively different. The gravity model parameters are often fit using proxy data such as cell phone, transportation and individual survey records [21]. This spatial model can then be coupled to a disease transmission model [22]. Alternatively, molecular data offer direct insight into disease mobility [4,23]. Genomic data have been used to construct distance-dependent spatial models for West Nile virus in North America [2] as well as dengue virus in Thailand [24] and Vietnam [25]. Other phylodynamic approaches, focused on mapping transmission trees [26], have been widely applied to infectious disease data including outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease [27], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [28] and tuberculosis [29].",

Transmission of EBOV within Sierra Leone was almost completely within its borders [36], which provided a constrained and representative dataset to investigate the utility of virus genomes to construct population-level spatial models. Paired with advances in phylogenetics that identify linkages between cases [8], EBOV genome data offer powerful insight into spatio-temporal, transmission events. These genomic linkages, in combination with geographical and demographical characteristics included in our framework, help infer the parameters of gravity and L\u00e9vy flight models. We focus on identifying data-driven, spatial models that are interpretable and consistent with established patterns of human population movement. Adaptive model selection during the course of the epidemic reveals a significant change in virus mobility in Sierra Leone: dependence on population size decreases towards the end of the epidemic. For future epidemics, we believe that this framework could be implemented to improve forecasting efforts and help design efficient intervention campaigns that adapt to real-time phylodynamics.",

The POTN algorithm computes a likelihood ratio based on a Poisson model of the mutation rate to identify genomes that are most likely to be direct relatives. This contrasts with widely used phylogenetic analyses that infer common ancestors, such as Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) [41]. The POTN algorithm produces a pairwise, time-directed network of ancestor and descendant genomes, linked by the relative change in their sequences between collection dates. For EBOV, we used an average nucleotide substitution rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 bp/site/yr, a value measured during the 2013\u20132016 epidemic; see Fig. 4F of [11]. A false discovery rate for each linkage is computed with a single degree-of-freedom \u03c72 test, with a cut-off at p = 0.05. Figure 1b shows a visualization of the EBOV POTN for Sierra Leone pruned to the shortest generation time for each ancestor.

By randomly drawing a similar number of samples from the inferred model and driving network, we found that the model fit is robust to the number of samples collected during the epidemic; see electronic supplementary material, figure S6 and accompanying text for more details. The observed distribution of dij is closely related to a power law for a significant portion of the data, shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S6.",

For example, the geographical structure of Sierra Leone constrains the number of possible trips over 300 km. This is consistent with the observed drop-off in transmission distances, indicating a limitation of the standard power-law model for the complex effects of national borders and local administrative divisions. Further, including other factors, such as the chiefdom-level population distribution, will allow for more flexibility in characterizing the observed distribution of transmission distances.",

The likelihood landscapes, with varying (\u03c1, \u03c42), are shown in figure 3d for Stages I\u2013III. Values of the log-likelihood for each stage and both models are shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S9. The likelihood ratio, comparing the gravity and power-law models during Stage II, indicated a strong preference for gravity shown in figure 1f. Further, figure 3b illustrates that the POTN for Stage II contains a significant number of transmission events in the Western Area of Sierra Leone supporting the population-dependent model. When setting the population parameter \u03c42 to the canonical value of 1, the gravity model was still preferred over the power law for this portion of the epidemic.

A similar qualitative trend is identified whether choosing the maximum, minimum, median or mean population chiefdom. However, the identified statistical change in model preference from gravity to power law after February 2015 was sensitive to this assumption, especially when using the maximum population chiefdom for each district. In Fang et al. [40], a majority of confirmed cases have chiefdom annotations except in the Western Area. Both the confirmed cases and virus genomes recorded during Stage I indicate that most cases in the Kenema district are from highly populated chiefdoms.

The ability to rapidly quantify spatio-temporal spread during an epidemic would allow for near real-time forecasts and the design of operationally relevant, spatially targeted interventions.

For this study, we posited two parsimonious models, well known in the epidemiology and ecology literature, to investigate the influence of population and distance on the spatial spread of cases. We discovered that the stochastic propagation of cases is best described by a probabilistic gravity model where dependence on the population and distance varies over the course of the epidemic. The gravity model was preferred in the early part of the epidemic when EBOV was circulating near cities in the east of Sierra Leone. Once the virus migrated to more densely populated areas of the capital area, such as Freetown, Kenema and Port Loko, the gravity model preference became much stronger. During this portion of the epidemic, the transmission events were highly local with a large proportion of linkages staying between large population centres. This observation is also consistent with recent studies of the superspreader phenomenon in the Western Area [52,56].",

            "text": "The probabilistic gravity model can be considered a generalization of a random walk process, weighted by country-specific population distributions. This population influence changed over the course of the EBOV epidemic. In fact, after March 2015, the population dependence diminished significantly. This suggests that EBOV mobility in the last stage of the epidemic can be accurately modelled as a spatial process dependent solely on distance. The MLE of the parameters for the gravity model showed a large uncertainty in the population exponent \u03c42. Further, the distance exponent was \u03c1 < 1, indicating a higher probability of larger distances between linked cases. In the pure power-law model, the disease mobility during this period has a L\u00e9vy flight exponent of order \u03b1 = \u03c1 \u2212 1 = 0.6, suggesting a space-fractional diffusion process. This result is consistent with the observation that confirmed EBOV cases decreased in the large cities of the Western Area and appeared sporadically in less populated areas far from the Western Area after March 2015. Further, this shift away from a strong preference for a gravity model coincided with an intervention campaign by the government of Sierra Leone called Operation Western Area Surge (OWAS) that occurred on 17 December 2014 [57]. Sociological observations, after the OWAS, described an increase in health centre avoidance, return trips to home villages and transmission away from population centres [58]. These results highlight the importance of continual collection of genomic data for characterizing the change in dynamic behaviour along with evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.",

Despite the EBOV data spanning the entire country and nearly the full time course of the epidemic, the collection of virus genomes was not part of a unified programme. Moreover, the metadata for each sequence, i.e. the global positioning system location and demographical information, are not completely resolved. Uncertainty in reporting due to collection and laboratory processing introduces delays that could impact the utility of predictive spatial models. Our model selection also currently consists of two classes of spatial models: gravity and L\u00e9vy flight. We expect to expand our framework to a wider variety of models, but are aware of the challenge in finding parsimonious descriptions of human mobility [59]. As a retrospective study, we have analysed the robustness of our methodology to uncertainties, but inherent difficulties in data collection and modelling will challenge real-time deployment of this tool.",
