Antibody development against every human protein is a prerequisite to improve this knowledge. Several high-throughput alternatives have been developed to generate antibodies to the entire proteome [3-5]. The Human Protein Atlas initiative (http://www.proteinatlas.org/) [3,4], the Sanger Institute Antibody Atlas Database, the NCI Clinical Proteomics [5], the HUPO human antibody initiative (http://www.hupo.org/research/hai/) [6], and several EU-funded consortia (ProteomeBinders, AffinityProteome, Affinomics [7-9]; http://www.proteomebinders.org) are all good examples of these alternatives.",

The affinity of scFvs for their targets might be comparable to that of mAbs or pAbs and in some cases even higher [15]. As a general rule, scFvs possess several advantages in comparison to IgG or Fabs such as higher tissue penetrance and more rapid clarification [16,17]. Moreover, antibody phage display, M13-based human libraries, is becoming particularly useful for the production and development of antibodies for immunotherapy in different diseases [18-21]. In vitro phage display pipelines have been setup to generate antibodies to the complete human proteome, but the selections are still carried out manually [8,9,22]. Screening of phage display antibody libraries is constrained by the necessity of having considerable amounts of antigen, at least 0.1-0.5 mg of protein for the whole procedure (selection, screening and validation).",

Furthermore, cell-free systems offer several advantages over traditional cell-based expression methods, which include lower sensitivity to product toxicity and suitability for high-throughput strategies, because of reduced reaction volumes and processing time. Recent improvements in translation efficiency have resulted in yields comparable to cell-based expression systems for difficult-to-express proteins [27-30].",

In 2000, the Riken Structural Genomics Initiative (Japan) reported the bacterial based cell-free protein expression production of about 25% of randomly chosen mouse cDNA clones with yields higher than 0.1 mg/ml [34]. Since then, several developments have significantly improved the yield of in vitro expressed proteins in the range of milligrams of protein per mL of reaction mix [27,28,35,36]. Another interesting initiative is the \"human protein factory\", for the expression of human proteins using the wheat-germ in vitro protein expression system and Gateway technology [24]. The authors reported a 97% success rate of protein expression over 13364 human proteins. Among them, they detected soluble proteins in 12682 out of 13364 clones [24]. There have been other successful high-throughput initiatives based on in vitro protein expression, with yields up to 6 mg/mL, which have been applied for protein arrays, nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallization studies [37-39].",

Antibody arrays were initially designed to capture and detect simultaneously multiple analytes with high affinity and selectivity in human biological samples (plasma, serum, tissue ...) in order to study variations between biological statuses [5]. We have explored the use of this proteomic technique for testing scFv antibody libraries against different antigens at the same time in order to identify specific scFvs, increasing the throughput of the screening step with minimal requirements of protein. In this report, we propose a novel methodology to develop scFv antibodies using human phage display antibody libraries in a short time (no more than four weeks) with only 5 \u03bcg of protein. Furthermore, this method could be automated in a high-throughput format to obtain \"antibodies on demand\" against any target, taking advantage of cell-free protein expression, antibody phage display and scFv antibody microarrays.",

Although some scFv expression differences were observed among the different clones, a correct printing pattern was detected, indicating adequate printing conditions (Figure 2B). The amount of scFv printed in the array was determined by printing serial 1:10 dilutions of previously reported anti-gastrin TA4 scFv at 0.5 \u03bcg/ml to construct a regression line [40]. Then, we used the median of the fluorescence signal of the scFvs in the regression line to get the amount of scFvs printed in the array. Approximately 12 pg of antibodies were printed in each spot of the array. The quality of the scFv antibody microarray was confirmed by the absence of cross contamination between successive spots. All positive controls as well as buffer spots showed the correct reactivity. The intra-assay reproducibility was assessed by comparing the results between the two replicas printed within the same chip for each clone and gave an R2 = 0.9311 (Figure 2C).",

With our microarray settings, we could print up to 4800 spots in a high-density antibody format per slide.

To explore the fact that we could have been losing 60-80% of total scFvs due to denaturation in our antibody microarrays [5,53], we decided to test all the scFvs by ELISA to compare the performance of the microarray and verify the usefulness of antibody microarrays for identification of scFv binders. Interestingly, we were able to identify a similar number of scFv binders by both screenings with a coincidence of 62 and 75% for GFP and Trx, respectively.
