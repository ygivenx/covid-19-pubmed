Apart from influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), several other respiratory viruses remain largely undiagnosed1. Understanding and defining the contribution of viral etiologies of severe respiratory illness in countries like South Africa that have a high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and associated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome may be important for health management and planning. In a prior South African study, 43% of respiratory specimens from patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) tested negative for 10 screened viruses (parainfluenza virus [PIV] types 1, 2 and 3; RSV; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus [HMPV]; adenovirus [AdV]; rhinovirus [RV]; influenza A [INFA]; and influenza B [INFB])2. Respiratory viruses not included in routine diagnostic testing such as human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoVs), and human polyomaviruses (hPyV) may be responsible for viral respiratory illness among patients that test negative for the more commonly screened viruses.",

Among these children, hBoV, hCoV\u2010229E, and hPyV\u2010WU were detected in 6.1% (37/610), 0.3% (2/610), and 3.4% (21/610) of specimens, respectively. In our study, a higher prevalence of hCoV\u2010229E was reported (Table 2). This may be due to the different case definitions used in the 2 studies. Findings similar to ours were reported in a study conducted in the Gulf region in children <5 years of age. In the latter study, the reported detection rates for these viruses were 4.9% (14/331) hBoV and hCoV\u2010229E, and 3.5% (10/331) hPyV\u2010WU.5 Globally, hBoV and hPyV\u2010WU are predominantly observed in children aged <4 years with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, which was also observed in our study.15 A recent South African study found that among children aged <1 year, hBoV (but not hCoV) detection was significantly associated with severe illness.16 Human polyomaviruses was not investigated in the latter study. Therefore, inclusion of laboratory tests for hBoV, hCoV\u2010229E, and hPyV\u2010WU in differential testing algorithms for surveillance and diagnostics for suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause may improve our understanding of the etiology of SARI, especially in a country like South Africa with a high number of immune compromised persons.",

As no control participant group was evaluated, the association and/or fraction of hBoV, hCoV, and hPyV detections that may contribute to severe respiratory illness could not be investigated. Second, the sample size was too small. Sero\u2010prevalence data for South Africa is lacking; therefore, using 50% expected prevalence to obtain the biggest sample size for a 95% confidence interval, a 5% desired absolute precision, and a design effect of 1, plus inflation by 25% for spoilage/quality of samples, the annual expected sample for the study should have been 480 (960 for the 2 years). Lastly, the study duration was too short, as a 4\u2010 to 5\u2010year period is required to assess seasonality and, therefore, the seasonality of HBoV, hCoV, and hPyV was not determined.",

Including tests for hBoV, hCoV, and hPyV viruses in differential diagnostic algorithms for surveillance and routine diagnostics may improve our understanding of the viral etiology of SARI in hospitalised patients in a high HIV/AIDS burden country like South Africa. However, the association of these virus detections with severe respiratory illness should be investigated further. Presently, in South Africa, in order to maintain sustainability of our respiratory illness surveillance programme, expanded testing for viral etiologies are mainly conducted in patients with SARI (including deaths and intensive care unit admissions) of unknown cause through outbreak investigations and specialized diagnostic test requests, where identification of an etiologic agent is desired for possible public health action.",
