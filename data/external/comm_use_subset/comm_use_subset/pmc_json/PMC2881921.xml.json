However, a relatively non-specific presentation means that influenza cannot be reliably distinguished from other ILI presenting in the autumn and winter seasons, and currently available diagnostic systems lack both the sensitivity and specificity required for efficient differentiation of ILI at the health facility or triage station [4]. A variety of different diagnostic tests are available to detect most common respiratory viruses, but there is still an unmet need for rapid, sensitive and accurate diagnosis. Commonly used conventional methods of virus culture, serological testing or antigen detection by direct immunofluorescence are reasonably sensitive, but relatively complex and labour-intensive, and are generally too slow to be clinically relevant [5]. Rapid antigen or \"point-of-care\" tests are widely available for influenza and RSV [6-8] and take only about 15-30 minutes to perform, but their sensitivity is lower than nucleic acid testing (NAT)[9,10].",

A negative control was extracted with every batch. MT-PCR primers were designed with a modified version of Primer 3 software [14], and were based on alignments of available sequences deposited in GenBank (Table 1) and of cDNA amplicons obtained from known virus isolates at CIDM cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) as positive controls. A nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect influenza A and B and other respiratory viruses, as previously described [13,15,16]. DNA sequences of all PCR amplicons were determined as needed by cloning into pGEM-T for M13 dye primer sequencing (Promega) and were compared with known sequences using EclustalW (ANGIS). The melt temperature, with a range of 1.5\u00b0C either side of predicted Tm, was deemed acceptable if the melt curve was normal sigmoidal. Verification of correct-sized discrete amplicons derived in step 2 MT-PCR assays was performed using a Bioanalyzer DNA separation chip (Agilent Technologies, Forest Hill, Victoria, Australia), as previously described [11].",

These are then aliquoted into individual reaction tubes containing nested specific PCR primers as template for the second step reaction [11] which was performed using a liquid handling robotics system provided by AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd. (Sydney, Australia). Primer and artificial internal control sequences are not shown due to commercial confidentiality agreements with AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd. The target regions are specified in Table 1, with example sequences. The internal control is a contrived sequence that does not appear in nature. No base pairing redundancies were specified in any of the primers used. Lyophilized primers and reagent kits were prepared at CFI and sent to CIDM, and to the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS, at Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide), for further testing of clinical samples collected during routine investigation of ILI outbreaks and sporadic infection at these two referral centres. For MT-PCR performance, a strip tube containing Step 1 multiplexed primers was placed in a thermal cycler, along with a Gene-Disc containing lyophilised Step 2 reagents and oil (for covering PCR reactions) on the robot deck. The samples were directly added to the strip tube in the thermal cycler. A software template for the reaction was then selected and all operations for performing the Step 1 multiplexed preamplification, dilution and aliquoting into the Step 2 reaction tubes in the Gene-Disc were performed automatically. The Gene-Disc was then hermetically sealed in a heat-sealer and Step 2 amplification carried out in a Rotor-Gene RG6000 thermal cycler. At the end of Step 2 the presence or absence of each target was automatically called using a software routine (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd.) that compared melt temperature of the product with expected values and checked the purity and quantity against predetermined threshold values, and these were all manually verified. The cycle threshold (Ct) is the number of cycles at the takeoff point of the amplification curve (see Figure 1). Quantitation was by comparison with the internal control, which was assigned an arbitrary value of 10 000, chosen so that the lowest concentration target detected had a value above \"1\". Concentration of the final step 2 product was expressed relative to the control as previously described [11].",

DNA hybridisation after multiplexed PCR is one solution but is slow and labour-intensive [27,28].

All MT-PCR reactions yielded normal melt curves and all reactions giving unexpected results also contained discrete correct-sized amplicons. No multiple or unexpected-size amplicons or discrepant melt temperatures were identified. Nevertheless, sequencing of clinical isolates was not performed after initial test validation and no additional alternative independent testing was performed to specifically verify second-step results, so contamination of the second-step reaction with unrelated first-step amplicons cannot be completely excluded.",

            "text": "The MT-PCR method is essentially a nested RT-PCR and would therefore be expected to be more sensitive than a conventional PCR or direct antigen detection system [29]. Specificity may thus be underestimated if MT-PCR detects target sequences in material below levels detected by conventional methods. Testing of control templates gave \"clean\" results with no evident cross-reaction (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4) and the unexpected positive results obtained in \"negative\" clinical specimens were almost uniformly at low levels, consistent with this as an explanation. Also consistent, unexpected additional positive results from MT-PCR were much more common in specimens deemed negative by IF than by PCR (see Table 4). For example, the additional MT-PCR-positive IF-negative samples at CIDM (n = 14) for INF-A were collected from symptomatic patients during an influenza outbreak and several were either confirmed by RT-PCR or were associated with seroconversion (greater than four-fold increase) or initial high (> = 32) titres to Influenza A. This level of additional positive results (~10%) is very similar to that seen in previous reports for assays of this type [30]. Taken all together and including assays tested within both profiles, MT-PCR correctly identified 141 (97.9%) of 144 clinical specimens found positive by standard methods. Conversely, taking into account all of those specimens found to be positive by MT-PCR in this study, IF detected a significant pathogen in 56/73 (77%) and in-house RT-PCRs detected 87/88 (99%). For influenza A detection, this was a relative sensitivity of 38/49 (78%) for IF and 41/42 (98%) for RT-PCR [16], compared to MT-PCR.",

Since this assay was developed, we have also experienced the influenza A/H1N1/09 pandemic, which caused a significant number of intensive care admissions and deaths in this country (33) and required modifications to include the NP gene of A/H1N1/09 and an M gene consensus (H1N1; A/H1N1/09; H3N2; H5N1).

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most important cause of acute lower respiratory tract diseases including bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children and may contribute to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually among the elderly and immunocompromised [1,35,36]. Human Parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3) is associated with pharyngitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children, and respiratory infections in adults and is the second most significant acute viral respiratory tract infection in young children after RSV. Both are leading causes of hospitalization in adults with acute community-acquired respiratory disease. The rhinoviruses (RV), of which there are more than 100 serotypes, act either as single pathogens or in mixed infections, but all of these may present as a non-specific ILI.",

Importantly, this method simultaneously subtypes Influenza A, identifies multiple pathogens and co-infections in a single specimen and provides potentially valuable quantitative data. A multiplexed method also facilitates recognition of co-circulating viruses in outbreak situations in which they might otherwise be assumed identical. It is clear that, as for influenza vaccine strategies, primer designs need to be reviewed regularly in light of prevalent sequence variations and the configuration of the multiplexed assay itself needs to be informed by the relevant epidemiology of the region. The assay we describe presently costs around AUD$15 (USD$12) for 6 targets (~USD$2 per target).
