            "text": "In the healthcare setting, the timely identification of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and the institution of infection control measures are crucial steps for the prevention and reduction of transmission events and outbreaks in the patient population. However, the detection of transmission events is based on limited evidence [1], and detection of specific pathogen clusters is generally subjective in nature [2]. Furthermore, even well-established infection prevention strategies can be often disregarded [3] at various levels. Overall, these factors may lead to the transmission of pathogens within the hospital, a missed opportunity to investigate a disease cluster, or false ascertainment of a cluster resulting in the misuse of hospital resources for investigational purposes [2]. Statistical methods, such as the scan statistic, may enhance the identification of disease clusters and/or outbreaks in the hospital setting [2,4]. The scan statistic [5] can be used to detect and evaluate clusters of infectious diseases in space, time, and/or space-time [6-8]. By understanding the clustering of infectious diseases spatially and/or temporally, potential risk factors can be identified [9], detailed investigations determining the association between exposures and disease interventions can be facilitated [10], and outbreaks can be detected [6].",

            "text": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks in healthcare facilities represent a significant burden to public health in terms of ward closures, infection control measures, increased patient morbidity and mortality rates, and healthcare costs [11,12]. In hospitals, identification of outbreaks is routinely based on the examination of microbiological test results and patients\u2019 charts [4], with the definition of an outbreak generally relying on rule-based criteria [2]. However, these types of criteria are prone to error since they fail to address changes in population size or random variation [2]. With the increasing availability of timely surveillance data within the hospital setting, the use of analytical methods may lead to the earlier detection of disease clusters or outbreaks [13]. In hospitals, the incorporation of the scan statistic for the detection of MRSA disease clusters, spatially and/or temporally, has been limited. In one study, a space-time permutation scan statistic was utilized to detect clusters throughout the hospital [2]. However, molecular data were not collected to validate MRSA clusters. In another investigation, a temporal scan statistic, incorporating molecular data, was employed to identify MRSA clusters which were used as a gold standard to evaluate other algorithms for cluster detection [4]. For both investigations, the application of a scan statistic to hospital data resulted in the identification of several significant MRSA clusters that were not identified by hospital personnel. However, as both studies were conducted in academic medical centres, further investigation of the scan statistic for identifying MRSA clusters under different healthcare settings is required [2,4].",

For clinical samples, S. aureus was confirmed using the gram stain and the tube coagulase test and MRSA was confirmed using Vitek\u00ae 2. For surveillance and clinical MRSA isolates, a standard panel of antimicrobials was used for susceptibility testing and included rifampin, clindamycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Testing was performed using Vitek\u00ae 2 and results were based on the standards set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [15]. At the hospital level, all specimens submitted for MRSA testing were collected at the discretion of medical personnel. Only one MRSA isolate per patient was collected for molecular typing.",

Manual backwards step-wise modeling was applied to fit a multivariable multilevel Poisson model to all previously identified significant co-variables.

The random effects negative binomial model allowed the overdispersion parameter to vary randomly by cluster based on a beta distribution (using the xtnbreg command in Stata) [24].

Under the null hypothesis, the expected number of cases in each time period covered by the scanning window is proportional to its population size; whereas under the alternative hypothesis, there is an elevated risk within the window as compared to outside the window [5]. For this investigation, the population size was defined as the number of patient-days for each service and ward on a monthly basis.

For four of the clusters (Cluster ID 19, 23\u201325), the temporal scan statistic indicated that these events occurred prior to dates reported by IPC personnel. This is an important finding as these events demonstrate that there may have been a delay in the institution of infection control strategies.

However, temporal scan tests conducted at the hospital and service (e.g., internal medicine) levels did not result in the identification of a cluster that corresponded in time to the MRSA outbreak. In the participating healthcare facility, specific rule-based criteria (e.g., \u2265 3 HA-MRSA cases in a 2 week period) are not used to establish MRSA outbreaks. Rather, data pertaining to the number of MRSA cases and the time period (i.e., number of days) are used to ascertain if an outbreak exists in the patient population and if an investigation should be initiated.

These clusters may represent extended outbreaks, temporal trends, changes in pathogen characteristics, or the representation of systematic changes (e.g., cleaning policies) at the hospital level during the surveillance period. For many of the long duration clusters, several non-spa type 2/t002 MRSA strains were identified in the patient population. These particular MRSA strains may indicate unique transmission events between patients or be part of an outbreak, as researchers have documented the existence of more than one MRSA strain during an outbreak investigation [25,26]. Alternatively, these non-spa type 2/t002 strains may represent genetic changes within the spa gene, such as deletions or duplications of repeats and point mutations [27], resulting in different spa types. Based on the MST that was constructed (Figure 2), six of the spa complexes were closely related to spa type 2/t002 by a difference in one repeat. For MRSA and S. aureus, research exploring the time required for a genetic event to occur has been conducted [28-30]; however, results of these investigations are based on specific strains and specific locations of the genetic event. Other plausible explanations for observing diverse spa types in these clusters include the introduction of spa types into the hospital via staff, visitors, and patients which resulted in transmission events, and healthcare workers and patients that may have been colonized with variant MRSA strains.",

Consequently, the true molecular composition for some clusters is not known, and it could not be determined if all cases within clusters were a result of unique transmission events or part of a true outbreak. Lastly, with the identification of a predominant spa type circulating in the patient population, the application of spa typing provided very little benefit for elucidating transmission events or recognizing potential outbreaks, especially for long duration clusters. Although it was not conducted in this study, the incorporation of whole-genome sequencing may be a viable tool for further elucidating possible transmission events and identify potential/true outbreaks in the hospital setting. Whole-genome sequencing provides an inventory of the microevolutionary changes of a bacterium and can be used to map genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions to a reference sequence [28]. Furthermore, this typing technique provides the best discrimination between closely related bacterial isolates in a timely manner [1,29].",

Further investigation of these nine MRSA isolates revealed that three isolates were identified in the same internal medicine cluster (Cluster ID 7; n = 2 in May, 2010; n = 1 in December, 2010) and three isolates were identified in the same surgery cluster (Cluster ID 13; n = 1 in July, 2010; n = 1 in August, 2010; n = 1 in September, 2010). The identification of identical spa types and antibiograms in two long duration clusters, suggests that transmission events among patients, hospital staff, or possibly even the contaminated environment, may have occurred. For spa types 23/t548, 93/t026, 268/t067, and 387/t653, it was noted that these particular spa types had indistinguishable antimicrobial profiles. This demonstrates that for the identification of transmission events and the determination of cases as outbreak or non-outbreak, relying on antibiogram data may result in inaccurate findings and the misclassification of cases as MRSA strains that differ genotypically may display identical antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.",

Although the figures are affiliated with bacteremias only, the public reporting of MRSA did not result in a dramatic decrease in the overall incidence of MRSA in this facility, which is in contrast to C. difficile. In September 2008, monthly data on C. difficile infections (CDIs) from Ontario hospitals were also posted on a publicly accessed web site [32]. At the participating hospital, a separate analysis of CDIs demonstrated that in 2006 and 2007, there were significantly more cases of CDI, compared to 2008 and 2009 (data not shown).

The increase in the MRSA case rate during this time period may have been due to the presence of respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza) within the hospital. Reports of increased hospital MRSA rates during outbreaks of respiratory pathogens have been published [34,35]. In the northern hemisphere, influenza season occurs from October to March [36].

An increase in the MRSA case rate may have occurred as infection control activities and surveillance were focused on influenza and away from MRSA [34], reduced staffing as a result of illness, antimicrobial prescribing practices [35] especially with fluoroquinolones which may have led to an increase in the risk for acquiring MRSA [38], and environmental contamination of MRSA which may have resulted in transmission events among staff and patients.",

Seasonal variation in MRSA is debatable with some studies documenting spring [39] or summer [40,41] with increased MRSA rates. However, in these studies, specific aspects of MRSA infections (e.g., community-acquired, healthcare-acquired, severe only) were investigated. A significant increase in the rate of MRSA cases was observed specifically in the months of March and April. As previously discussed, an increase in the number of MRSA cases in March may have been a result of the presence of influenza, or other respiratory viruses, in the hospital.",

Further examination of these clusters revealed several events that may be equivalent to MRSA outbreaks or transmission events that were not recognized by hospital personnel. By adopting a comprehensive approach for MRSA surveillance, clusters were identified at the hospital, service, and ward levels. Infection control efforts can be focused at one or more levels to identify risk factors for MRSA acquisition and transmission, establish interventions, and evaluate control measures. The identification of specific time periods that corresponded to significant increases in the rate of MRSA cases in the patient population may have been correlated with other determinants at the hospital level, including the presence of other pathogens. In this investigation, spa typing provided very little information due to the presence of a predominant spa type. Therefore, the use of a different typing technique (e.g., whole-genome sequencing) or additional supplementary information may be warranted to decipher transmission events and clusters. Application of scan statistics for hospital surveillance of MRSA would probably be most rewarding in facilities with access to higher resolution molecular typing data. Future research utilizing the temporal scan statistic, prospectively, with the application of molecular typing, especially whole-genome sequencing, to identify MRSA clusters in real-time and elucidate transmission events in the hospital setting, is warranted.",
