The\nsequences of these coronaviruses (civet-CoVs) are similar not only to each other\nbut also to SARS-CoV.

The MD identified both bats\nand humans as hosts of these samples, but bats are the preferable hosts for\nsamples 1\u201326 and the second choice for samples 27\u201331.\nThis finding is also expected as bats are considered to be natural hosts of\nthese viruses.",

These dinucleotide biases are common characteristics of RNA viruses in\nvertebrates11121516. As most vertebrates exhibit a very low\nCpG representation in genomes, RNA viruses may gradually adapt to the accumulation\nof host mutations and mimic the host gene\u2019s dinucleotide patterns for\nsurvival11. For DNA viruses, the most-accepted mechanisms for the\nsuppression of CpG dinucleotides are the methylation of CpG nucleotides and the\nsubsequent deamination of 5-methylcytosine, which renders CpG a mutational\nhotspot24. For RNA viruses, a different hypothesis is that the\nRNA viruses encounter different selection pressures when they switch to a new host,\nand viral RNA genes mimic host mRNAs to avoid immune detection11.\nSimilar to other human ssRNA viruses, coronaviruses show a strong correlation\nbetween CpG pressure and C+G content (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient,\nr = 0.5443,\np < 2.2e-16, our data).

Variations on these genes may enable a virus to transmit cross-species.\nOne famous example would be the polymerase 2 (PB2) of influenza A virus, in which\namino acid change from E to K at its 627th position would render the virus to\nreplicate in mammalian cells333435. In coronaviruses, the spike\nprotein is functionally associated with recognition of hosts and the RNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase (RdRp) is related to proliferation of virus. However, there are two\nobstacles limiting the use of RdRp gene: (1) The similarities among nucleotide\nsequences is too high to train MD model, i.e., the variation rate of RdRp sequence\nis slower and cannot provide enough resolution to discriminate different\ncoronaviruses; (2) Even worse, available full-length CDSs in public databases are\nvery limited \u2014 only 23 or so. On the contrary, the spike gene perfectly\nsatisfied the requirements for variation rate and availability, therefore was\nadopted as markers in this study.",

Unlike the Euclidian distance (ED), which measures the absolute distance\nbetween points or mass centres in space, the Mahalanobis distance considers the\nvariances within a population and the covariance between variables. In some cases,\nespecially when a population with individuals who are scattered across a wide range\nis located close to a \u201ctight\u201d population with smaller\ninternal variations, the MD may classify marginal individuals from the latter into\nthe \u201cloose\u201d population even if they are\n\u201cclose\u201d to a \u201ctight\u201d population\naccording to the ED. The MD enables \u201cloose\u201d populations to\nhave a greater number of points. The SVM has a different philosophy. SVM separates\npopulations by finding a hyperplane that maximizes the distances between\npopulations. When a \u201cloose\u201d population is close to the\nboundary of a \u201ctight\u201d population, SVM is more likely to find\nthis hyperplane within the former.
