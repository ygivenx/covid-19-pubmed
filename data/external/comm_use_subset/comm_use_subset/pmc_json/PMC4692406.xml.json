PEDv is highly contagious, with an incubation period of three to four days [5]. Fecal-oral transmission is believed to be the main mode of transmission. Clinical signs of PEDv may vary widely and are dependent on age of pig, previous exposure, and the immunological status of the farm. The clinical presentation of PEDv may be indistinguishable from that of TGEV. The primary clinical finding is watery feces, which may be flocculent and fetid, lasting 3 to 4 days in all ages of swine. Swine might vomit. Dehydration and metabolic acidosis may be secondary signs. PEDv may spread more slowly than TGEV. If swine recover, it is usually after 7 to 10 days [6]. Morbidity can approach 100 percent in all ages of susceptible swine [6]. In suckling pigs, mortality commonly reaches 50 to 80 percent, but declines to 1 to 3 percent in grower pigs [6].",

For the first method, general direction was determined by first calculating the mean geographic center of incident cases for each day of the outbreak. The mean geographic centers were then used to create a vector indicating the direction and distance of PEDv spread from one day to the next for each day of the outbreak. These mean daily vectors were then used as inputs to the linear directional-mean function in ArcGIS. The linear directional-mean function outputs a single vector indicating the mean direction and mean distance of PEDv spread for all cases (Fig 1). The function also outputs numeric values indicating the average distance of pathogen spread, average direction of spread, and a directional variance value indicating how much the daily vectors deviate from the average direction.",

The null hypothesis is that cases following (in a temporal sense) a given case are located in a random direction. The alternative hypothesis is that subsequent cases are located in a specific direction. We selected the relative model for two reasons. First, case sites likely shed virus for several weeks. Second, this outbreak lasted only 31 days. Therefore, we believe that each case site had the potential to infect subsequent sites throughout the duration of the outbreak.

The description of this outbreak may be useful in understanding factors that influence the spread of PEDv. Several spatial methods were used to describe the outbreak. The hotspot analysis showed that, overall, the disease was clustered rather than randomly distributed. This result suggested that sites in proximity to a positive site were at increased risk of acquiring PEDv. One limitation of the data in this study was that negative sites were not tested to verify their negative status. Because clinical signs of PEDv are more noticeable in sow farms, it is possible that clinical signs were overlooked on some farms with growing pigs, which would result in them being misclassified as PEDv negative.",

            "text": "We also examined the possibility of airborne spread of PEDv. If airborne dissemination of PEDv played a role in this outbreak, we would expect the direction of disease spread to be correlated with the predominant wind direction. We used two methods to determine the direction of disease spread, and both had similar results: one indicated spread was south to slightly southwest, and the other indicated spread was to the southeast. The slight difference in results is attributable to the different underlying methodologies. The predominant wind direction during the outbreak was toward the south with some southeast and southwest winds; the strongest wind gusts were toward the southwest. Therefore, our results provide support to the hypothesis of airborne PEDv spread, since the direction of disease spread correlated qualitatively with wind direction. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously because our analysis has a number of limitations. First, we did not have information on direct and indirect contacts among sites, such as movement of trucks, feed, pigs, people, and equipment. These contacts should be considered before pathogen spread is attributed to airborne mechanisms. For example, if truck movement predominately occurs in a southern direction, this could explain the southern movement of PEDv. In addition, swine farm density in the area needs to be considered because unequal distribution of swine farms could influence the observed direction of disease spread. To analyze the distribution of swine farms in the area, we calculated the number of swine farms at risk (uninfected swine sites in our dataset) in the eight primary compass directions relative to the index (first) case. The results of this analysis show that 76 percent of the population at risk was located south of the index case (Fig 6), which could also be a factor in the apparent southern movement of PEDv. Furthermore, we did not consider other meteorological variables such as temperature and humidity, which may also play a role in airborne pathogen transmission.",

Wind can generate complex air movement patterns due to changes throughout the day and week. Therefore, we can look only at general trends. Also, wind can vary greatly over the course of a day or week. This analysis considers the predominant wind direction. It is possible, however, that strong gusts of wind occurred in other directions. These gusts could have spread virus in directions other than the predominant wind direction. Furthermore, to more completely describe the influence of wind, we need more information about how far a virus travels at various wind speeds and about what particle sizes (e.g., dust) could carry PEDv. Without knowing the transport mechanism in the air, it is difficult to say what influences wind direction and wind speed could have on the spread of PEDv among sites.",

A similar analysis of wind direction could be conducted on data from outbreaks in other geographic regions in the United States. Additional studies should include information on the movements of trucks and pigs, as well as other movements that could cause virus spread, if possible. In addition, testing of more air samples with PCR and bioassay are recommended. Sequencing of isolates could more accurately track movement of specific virus in future research and was another limitation of this study. Studies have shown that infectious virus can persist in fecal slurry for at least 28 days at 4\u00b0C and for at least 14 days but less than 28 days at room temperature [14], and it could be important to determine if slurry could be aerosolized or carried aloft by the wind as small fecal clumps that could protect the virus. Additionally, although it has been shown that infectious virus survives for less than 2 weeks on dry feed mixture at room temperature [14], it would be helpful to determine how long the virus can survive on dry matter, which could be easily borne on the wind. Flies and other insects may also play a role in disease transmission, and insects may be affected by wind patterns. Therefore, research is also needed to evaluate whether PEDv on or in flies can infect pigs and, if so, whether the flies are biological or mechanical vectors.",
