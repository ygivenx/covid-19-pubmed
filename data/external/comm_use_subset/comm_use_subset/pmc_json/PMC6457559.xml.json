Accordingly, such approaches rely heavily on highly informative genetic sequence data for identifying likely transmission pairs, as temporal data is generally consistent with a large number of potential ancestries [16].",

            "text": "However, WGS are not always informative of the transmission route of an epidemic. Firstly, genetic diversity across most outbreaks is low and a significant portion of genetic sequences expected to be identical [17], most prominently if the pathogen genome is small (e.g. human influenza [18]), the mutation rate low (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [19]), or the generation time (delay between primary and secondary infection) short (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae [20]). In these cases, transmission pairs cannot be accurately identified by genetic data alone, resulting in an overall poorly resolved transmission tree. The informativeness of genetic sequence data is also limited by complex evolutionary behavior. Didelot et al. demonstrated that realistic genetic models accounting for within-host diversity, in which several strains coexist inside a host and can be transmitted and sampled, place significant uncertainty around ancestry allocation even when genetic diversity across the outbreak is high, as multiple transmission scenarios are consistent with the genetic data [15]. Pathogens displaying significant within-host diversity include those with long periods of carriage (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus [21]) or a propensity for super-infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae [22]). WGS is also uninformative of the direction of transmission between donor-recipient pairs if multiple sequences per host are not available [23]. Finally, WGS will generally not be available for all infected individuals, especially in resource poor settings. In the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for example, sequences were collected in only 5% of cases [24]. Genetic data is therefore frequently of limited use in reconstructing transmission trees, and inference methods that rely heavily on it will perform poorly in such circumstances.",

A frequently collected and highly informative source of data on likely transmission routes is contact data, an integral component of early outbreak response that describes the network of reported contacts with infected individuals. Contact data provided most of the information used to reconstruct transmission chains during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [25], Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [26] and Ebola [1,27,28] epidemics, and is routinely collected in outbreaks of HIV [29] and Tuberculosis [30]. Contact data can be classified as \u2018exposure\u2019 data and or \u2018contact tracing\u2019 data. Exposure data describes contacts between a given case and their potential infectors and is an intrinsic part of case definition in diseases with person-to-person transmission. Contact tracing data describes contacts between confirmed/probable cases and individuals they could have infected: it is used for active case discovery and rapid isolation and is an integral part of containment strategy. Importantly, both types of contact data potentially contain information on the topology of the transmission tree.",

As an improvement over other approaches, the integration of a full contact model reduces the reliance on high quality genetic data for accurate inference. We evaluate the performance of this new model and compare the value of the different types of data for inferring who infects whom, using a variety of simulated outbreak scenarios. We then apply our approach to the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, integrating the available data on contact structures and genome sequences in a single statistical framework for the first time.

Outbreaks were simulated using empirical estimates of the generation time distribution, the incubation period distribution and the basic reproduction number R0 (i.e. the average number of secondary infections caused by an index case in a fully susceptible population [33]).

Importantly, the original transmission pathway inferred in the absence of genetic data (sin2748 infecting sin2677 and sin2774) also remained plausible.

This is significant when considering that genetic diversity in many pathogens arises too slowly to resolve a significant portion of transmission pairs by genetic means [17], and that within-host genetic diversity of other pathogens hinders accurate transmission tree reconstruction from genetic data [38]. Furthermore, sequencing pathogen genomes from enough cases in an outbreak to resolve individual transmission events is frequently unrealistic in the face of logistical and financial limitations [24]. In contrast, contact tracing is routinely conducted during outbreak response, and therefore provides a valuable additional window of information on transmission events without placing an additional burden on field epidemiologists.

However, they assume complete sampling of contacts and cases, and automatically designate confirmed cases with a known contact as transmission pairs. This is equivalent to fixing \u03bb at a value of 0 in our model, which our analysis of the SARS dataset has shown is unsuitable for integrating other types of data in a meaningful manner.

Such a mechanistic model natively relates epidemiological processes to a set of observed contact data and has the advantage of potentially accommodating complex contact structures caused by non-random mixing in the future. However, a prospective model of this sort is considerably more complex to develop in a statistically tractable manner and has necessitated the assumption of a single index case, whereas multiple infectious introductions are easily accounted for in our contact likelihood. Furthermore, their approach does not explicitly model under-reporting of contacts, and therefore does not allow valuable prior information on the coverage of the contact tracing effort to inform the analysis.

By modelling contact tracing as a probabilistic process in a Bayesian framework, information on the contact tracing effort can also be embedded in the prior to improve the inferential process and more explicitly describe the assumptions underlying it. For example, if most contacts in an outbreak are expected to have been reported, the prior on the contact reporting coverage \u03b5 can be shifted to provide greater support for higher values, reducing support for ancestries that lack a contact. \u03b5 could even be fixed at a value of 1, meaning a reported contact is required for a given transmission pair to be inferred, given the assumption that every contact has been reported. Similarly, as shown for the 2003 SARS outbreak, an informative prior on the non-infectious contact probability \u03bb should generally be used. As most contact tracing efforts are conducted under the belief that non-transmission pairs experience contacts with significantly lower probability than transmission pairs, the prior on \u03bb should provide support for lower values, in turn placing greater weight on reported contacts when assigning ancestries.",

The coverage of contact tracing efforts conducted in low resource settings may therefore be low [47], and consequently poorly informative of the transmission network (Fig 1). Even if a significant proportion of contacts are reported, a high degree of mixing between cases can obscure the topology of the underlying transmission network, for example within hospital wards or classrooms.

As the contacts are undated, the model does not consider that they are only indicative of transmission events if they occur during the infectious period of the infector, potentially resulting in overconfident ancestry assignments if contacts frequently occur outside this time period. However, as epidemiologists generally only record meaningful contacts occurring within likely windows of infection, the assumption that recorded contacts represent epidemiologically plausible transmission pairs appears reasonable. As currently implemented, our model also does not account for different weights between contacts, which could be useful for example to stratify different types of sexual intercourse by their risk of HIV transmission [48], or TB contacts by their duration of contact (e.g. household vs. casual). However, it could be easily extended to do so by using separate parameters for the reporting coverage (e.g. \u03b51, \u03b52, \u03b53) and non-infectious contact probability (e.g. \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3) of each type of contact. Furthermore, the contact model is undirected and treats exposure data and contact tracing data equally, resulting in a loss of information about the potential directionality of the infectious interaction which must instead be inferred from other data. Directionality could be incorporated with relative ease by treating reported contacts as asymmetric (individual i contacting individual j is distinct from j contacting i) and relating this to the infector-infectee relationship in the putative transmission tree (I infecting j is distinct from j infecting I). However, the current model generally inferred directionality successfully from temporal data simulated under realistic delay distributions (Fig 1).",

The model is hierarchical and describes two processes: the occurrence of contacts and the reporting of contacts. Transmission pairs experience contact with probability \u03b7. This formulation accounts for the possibility of transmission occurring without direct contact, for example by indirect environmental contamination as is observed with Clostridium difficile [52]. Sampled, infected individuals that do not constitute a transmission pair experience contact with probability \u03bb, the non-infectious contact probability. Contacts that have occurred, either between transmission pairs or non-transmission pairs, are then reported with probability \u03b5, the contact reporting coverage.
