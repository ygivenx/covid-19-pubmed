Its advantage is that, according to the characteristics of infectious diseases, the model of infectious diseases is reasonably assumed, the appropriate parameters are set, and the appropriate variables are selected. Then, the dynamic characteristics of infectious diseases can be clearly revealed. It has laid a solid foundation for further analysis of the causes and key factors of the spread of infectious diseases, and for seeking the optimal strategies for the prevention and control of such diseases.",

Some of these are used to study the general laws of infectious diseases, while others are used to study specific infectious diseases, such as HFMD (Hand foot and mouth disease), tuberculosis, AIDS, and so on. In 1760, Bernoulli [7] began using mathematical models to study the spread of smallpox by vaccination. In 1906, Hamer [8] constructed and analyzed a discrete time model for the study of recurrent measles epidemics. In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [9] proposed the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model for the first time in order to study the epidemic law of the Black Death prevailing in Europe at that time. On the basis of the SIR model\u2019s analysis, the \"threshold theory\" was proposed to distinguish the spread or regression of the disease. The validity of the SIR model has been proven by the data regarding large-scale infectious diseases in history, thus the deterministic model [10] based on a differential equation has been widely accepted.",

That model considers that the latency of infectious diseases also has an impact on infectious diseases, so the model is more realistic. Focusing on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) infectious disease spread in recent years, Safi and Gumel [12] constructed the SEQIJR(Susceptible-Exposed-Quarantine-Infective-Isolation-Recovered) model according to the characteristics of SARS.

All things being equal, with the increase of population density, infectious diseases spread faster, and infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population. When analyzing the influence of sex ratio on the spread of infectious diseases, we considered two factors, namely, different influence coefficient and different sex ratio. First, the ratio of males to females was set to 4:1. Because of the large population base of males, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population when the infection coefficient is greater. Second, the influence coefficients of infectious diseases on males and females were 0.9 and 0.2, respectively. Because infectious diseases have a greater influence on males, when the number of males is larger, the influence of infectious diseases on the population is greater. When analyzing the influence of age structure on the spread of infectious diseases, we simulated three types of population distribution structure, namely, young, adult, and aged, according to the age structure distribution ratio. The number of members of the infected population and deaths in the aged cities were the largest, and the susceptibility of adult cities to infectious diseases was stronger. That is, the uniform distribution of age plays a more active role in the spread of infectious diseases.",
