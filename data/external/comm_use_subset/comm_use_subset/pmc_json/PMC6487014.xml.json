TGEV is an enteropathogenic coronavirus (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae) with a large, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The genome contains nine open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 16 kinds of nonstructural proteins and four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N), which are arranged in the order of 5\u2032-replicase-(1a/1b)-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 [2]. The spike protein is the largest of the four structural proteins; as the main envelope glycoprotein on the virion surface [3], S plays a key role in the early infection of TGEV [4].",

In the early stage of TGEV infection, TGEV-S1 is mainly responsible for binding to cellular receptors, and the S2 domain is associated with membrane fusion between the virus and host cells. Compared with the S2 domain, the S1 domain has many significant functions similar to those of the entire S protein, including enteric tropism [6], sialic acid-binding activity [7], neutralizing antibody induction, and host receptor binding. Determinants for enteric tropism and sialic acid recognition are located in a 224 aa region at the N terminus of the TGEV S1 domain. In addition, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of TGEV, which resides in a 150 aa fragment at the C-terminus of the S1 region, recognizes and binds to the cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN). The four main antigenic sites (A to D) on the S protein are mostly contained within the S1 domain [8]. Interestingly, the immunogenicity of TGEV S1 is stronger than that of the whole S protein and is the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies [9].",

In the present study, using a yeast two-hybrid system, we found that TGEV-S1 interacts with multiple intracellular proteins, including UBX domain-containing protein 1 (UBXN1).",

The UBX family is characterized by low homology with ubiquitin at the amino acid level but has the same 3-dimensional structure as ubiquitin [10]. UBXN1 has the same structure as NSFL1C, UBXD7, UBXD8, and FAF1. All of these proteins feature an N-terminal UBA domain and a C-terminal UBX domain [11]. The N-terminal UBA domain binds and functions as a cofactor for valosin-containing protein (VCP), also known as p97, which plays a central role in many ubiquitin-mediated pathways and in numerous biological activities, including cell cycle and protein damage [12]. The C-terminal UBX domain has a strong inhibitory effect on the RNA virus-induced type I interferon response [13]. In the present study, we further confirmed that UBXN1 is associated with TGEV-S1 expression and TGEV replication, and our findings provide insight into the role of UBXN1 in TGEV infection.",

Western blotting showed that pGBKT7-S1 produced a fusion protein of approximately 100 kDa (Figure 1B). Yeast cells harboring pGBKT7-S1 and those harboring pGBKT7 (control) were spread at two dilutions onto SD/Trp plates, and the size and number of yeast colonies produced by pGBKT7-S1 were compared with those of colonies produced by the control pGBKT7. The results suggest that the bait vector was not toxicity to the yeast (Figure 1C). Yeast cells harboring pGBKT7-S1 were spread at two dilutions on plates of three different selective media. No colony growth was observed on the SD/\u2212Trp/X-\u03b1-Gal/AbA plates, indicating that there was no self-activation phenomenon for the reporter genes (Figure 1D). These results indicate that the constructed pGBKT7-S1 bait vector could be used the yeast two-hybrid system for screening host proteins that interact with the TGEV-S1 protein. TGEV-S1 protein-associated cellular proteins were identified using the yeast two-hybrid system.

            "text": "In the present study, most of the 20 proteins identified to interact with TGEV-S1 are involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins, biological signal transduction, and negative regulation of signal pathways. Five of the screened proteins were aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs). ARSs are widely expressed among organisms and are responsible for catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs [16], and the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in TGEV infection has already been explored [17]. Microsomal glutathione transferase 1 (MGST1) is a membrane-associated protein in the eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) superfamily, which are glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) [18]. MGST1 is widely distributed, with high levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). MGST1 is an ER-membrane-bound enzyme [19, 20]. MGST1 participates in a variety of physiological activities, including cellular defense against toxic, carcinogenic, and pharmacologically active electrophilic compounds (thereby protecting cells against H2O2-induced cell trauma) [2, 21]. The sensor histidine kinase is a membrane receptor with the highest diversity among all biological activities of microorganisms [22]. The receptor region of this protein is responsible for structural dynamics in control signal regulation [23]. This receptor functions in two-component signaling systems (TCSs); tens of thousands of TCSs are necessary for many aspects of biological activities in cells, including growth and survival [24]. Kinesin-like protein (KIF2C) belongs to the kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) and has the features of a highly conserved structural domain and a core that catalyzes hydrolysis. KIF2C plays a significant role in intracellular transport systems as a molecular motor that transmits the energy released from chemical reactions into mechanical motion [25]. Calcium-binding protein 2-like regulates its own biological activities via a reversible interaction of its specific protein-binding sites with Ca2+ [26]. Ca2+ is a common intracellular signal carrier that regulates many cellular processes from cell birth, differentiation, and reproduction to apoptosis [27].",

            "text": "In our screening results, UBXN1 appeared at a high frequency among the candidate proteins and was known to have a strong inhibitory effect on the RNA virus-induced type I interferon response [13]. Therefore, the candidate protein UBXN1 was selected as protein of interest for further verification of its interaction with TGEV-S1. Recently, UBXN1 was identified as a negative regulator in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-mediated signaling pathway [11]. In the process of TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 host cells, the RNA of the single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus TGEV is recognized as a viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). PAMPs are mainly regulated by cytoplasmic receptors, such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) [28]. Once the viral RNA is recognized, RIG-1 and MDA5 trigger a signal cascade reaction, stimulating the production of cytokines and chemokines. Type I interferons (IFNs) are quickly produced to establish the antiviral status in host cells. Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) (also known as IPS-1, CARDIF, and VISA) is an important protein in the RLR signaling pathway. MAVS binds to viruses via an interaction between the N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RLRs. Then, the TRAF functional module (TIM) recruits the E2 ligases TRAF3 and TRAF6, which activate canonical I\u03baB kinases (IKKs) and IKK-related kinases such as TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, and eventually promoted the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory factors [29].",

UBXN1 blocks the binding site of TRAF3/6 (aa 450\u2013480), which is important for MAVS-mediated regulation of the IFN induction. The binding of UBXN1 to MAVS interferes with intracellular MAVS oligomerization and blocks the formation of the MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome to inhibit the type I IFN response [2]. It has been confirmed that the N terminus of UBXN1 is responsible for binding to MAVS (aa 438\u2013467) and that UBXN1\u2019s functions in ubiquitination are independent of binding to VCP/p97 [30].",

UBXN1 directly bound to S1 in vitro and in vivo, as determined by the GST pulldown and Co-IP assays. Moreover, we found that TGEV-S1 and UBXN1 had a positive association. TGEV infection triggered an increase in the UBXN1 levels, and UBXN1 promoted TGEV proliferation, as proven by the siRNA and overexpression assays. We deduced that the binding of TGEV-S1 to UBXN1 induced UBXN1 expression to enhance TGEV proliferation. TGEV infection induces massive production of IFN-I in host cells, but it also results in a variety of immune escape mechanisms with IFN resistance. Finally, we confirmed by siRNA and overexpression assays that UBXN1 had a negative relationship with IFN-\u03b2, suggesting that TGEV infection promoted UBXN1 to inhibit the production of IFN-\u03b2 in the late stage of infection to augment proliferation. The detailed mechanism of this process is worthy of further research.",

We further confirmed the interaction between TGEV-S1 and UBXN1 and found that UBXN1 expression increased after TGEV infection. Moreover, UBXN1 negatively regulated TGEV-induced IFN production. We reported for the first time the interaction between TGEV-S1 and the UBXN1 protein in IPEC-J2 cells and found that UBXN1 plays an important role in the replication of TGEV in cells.
