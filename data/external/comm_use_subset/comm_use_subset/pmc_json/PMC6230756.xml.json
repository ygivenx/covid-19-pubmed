Children with DCM mostly have to be on chronic heart failure medications and often progress into severe heart failure, requiring heart transplantation with or without a bridging mechanical heart. About half of the children were reported to have an identified cause of DCM [1] compared to 9\u201316 % in adults [2, 3]. One of the most frequent causes of DCM in young children is myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle, which can be caused by various conditions, including viral or bacterial pathogens, autoimmune disease or exposure to toxins [4]. The most common viral causes of myocarditis in the paediatric population include coxsackievirus B3, adenovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus, influenza A and B, and hepatitis viruses [5\u20138]. Myocarditis is also detected during post mortem in 2\u201346 % cases of sudden death in young people [2, 3].",

            "text": "The gold standard for confirming viral aetiology is virus detection from heart muscle biopsy sample, an invasive method that carries a substantial risk, particularly if the child is unwell or in severe heart failure [9\u201311]. Rhinovirus, a member of the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae, is the leading cause of upper respiratory infection in the world; it is the most frequently detected virus in human infection worldwide [12, 13]. However, lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children associated with severe clinical manifestations caused by rhinovirus could be underestimated due to lack of screening. Predisposing factors and underlying conditions are known to contribute to rhinovirus-associated severe respiratory diseases [14]. One study reported the possible link between rhinoviruses and congenital heart disease [14]; however, the causal role of rhinoviruses in cardiac conditions remains elusive. The genome of the virus is a positive sense ssRNA with approximately 7200 bp [15], and classified at least into three groups of rhinoviruses: A, B and C. Rhinovirus C, detected in 2006, was classified as a new species in 2010 [16]. This group was known to be associated with more severe illness than rhinovirus A and B, and resistant to commonly used antiviral treatments for rhinovirus [17]. A number of studies have reported the association of rhinovirus C with increased wheezing, asthma exacerbations and lower respiratory tract infection in children [7]. The virus was also detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage specimen, pericardial fluid, plasma and stools of a 14-year-old patient with pericarditis [18]. However, the association of rhinovirus C with DCM or myocarditis is not well documented. Currently, there are about 55 different types of human rhinovirus C, with 13 % variability in VP1 and at least 10 % variability in VP4/VP2. Vaccine and specific viral therapies for rhinoviruses are not currently available, and treatment is primarily supportive [15]. Here, we report the viraemic detection of rhinovirus C in a 4-year-old boy with acute onset DCM, suggesting a likely possible causative role of this virus in severe cardiac disease.",

There was no history of chest pain, cyanosis, joint pain or swelling. Predisposing factors, such as congenital cardiac disease, were excluded by review of the patient\u2019s medical records. The patient received treatment in a primary care centre before being admitted to hospital. On examination, he was tachypnoeic and pale, with clammy extremities. His heart rate was 90 beats min\u22121, respiratory rate 30 breaths min\u22121, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg and temperature 37 \u00b0C. There was a mild face and lower limb oedema. On cardiac examination, there was decreased cardiac impulse on palpation. Heart sounds were muffled and no murmur was heard. His liver was palpable 3 cm below the costal angle. Pulses were palpable and equal in all four extremities. Laboratory examinations revealed a normal haemoglobin level of 132 g l\u22121 with a slightly increased white blood cell count (15 900 cells mm\u22123), whereas the platelet count was within normal limits (342 000 platelets mm\u22123). Unfortunately, cardiac markers such as troponin, creatinine kinase (CK) and its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) were not tested due to limited resources. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with congested lungs. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 136 beats min\u22121. There was a normal P wave with slightly prolonged PR interval (>0.2 s). The QRS axis was normal and a possible left ventricular hypertrophy. There was no obvious ST change. Informed consent for patient management was taken by the clinician in the hospital before examination.",

Additional screening for dengue, chikungunya, coxsackievirus, influenza, herpesvirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus was also performed following our laboratory algorithm. The PCR product of the VP4/VP2 region was sequenced using Big Dye Terminator and Sanger sequencing for genotyping and phylogenetic analysis. The VP4/VP2 region sequence was analysed and compared with a selection of reference strains from the GenBank database using Geneious software R8 version 8.1 [20].

With the absence of isolation from the cardiac muscle, the role of rhinovirus in the pathogenesis is not definite. Further studies with more comprehensive diagnostic evaluation of myocarditis, with extensive viral testing panels and antibody assays, are needed to confirm the association, as well as advanced characterization of the virus to determine any amino acid mutations with the potential to cause cardiac complications.",
