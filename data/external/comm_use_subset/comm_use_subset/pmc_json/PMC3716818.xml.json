While being a common causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina in young children, it can cause severe complications, such as myocarditis, acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and even death [1-3]. EV71 is classified into three genotypes A, B and C based on molecular analysis using VP4 and VP1 gene sequences [4]. The prototype EV71 strain BrCr belonging to genotype A was first identified in California in 1970 [5,6], and this genotype was not detected thereafter until 2008 when genotype A strains re-emerged in central China [7]. Genotypes B and C are each further divided into five genotypes B1-B5 and C1-C5, respectively [4,8]. A research group has proposed a novel subgenotype B0 of EV71 that was circulating in the Netherlands from 1963 to 1967 [9].",

            "text": "Mutation and recombination are common phenomena in the evolution of enteroviruses [10-12]. The infidelity of enterovirus 3D polymerase can result in a mutation rate as high as one mutation per every newly synthesized genome [13]. The preferential recombination in non-structural protein coding regions, where a high nucleotide sequence identity between two parental strains may favor template switching during negative strand synthesis, is thought to be mediated by a \u201ccopy-choice\u201d mechanism [12,14]. The occurrence of intratypic and intertypic recombination events in EV71 has been reported during EV71 epidemics in Asian countries since the late 1990s [15-19]. A study from Taiwan revealed that intratypic recombination between EV71 genotypes B and C has taken place in one EV71 isolate N3340-TW-02 [18]. In China, intertypic recombination between EV71 subgenotype C2 and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) strain G-10 has occurred in two EV71 isolates, SHZH98 and SHZH03 [20]. In 2008, we have performed complete genome sequencing on two EV71 strains, SZ/HK08-5 and SZ/HK08-6, from Shenzhen during a large HFMD outbreak in China and the result showed that both intra- and inter-typic recombination events were detected in the two strains [15]. These unique \u201cdouble-recombinant\u201d and other subgenotype C4 strains were proposed to belong to a new genotype, genotype D. Another research group also demonstrated that subgenotype C4 strains should be designated as genotype D [19]. EV71 epidemics have been detected in Hong Kong [21], but the molecular epidemiology and genomic data of EV71 isolates circulating in our population is lacking. In this study, we aim to examine the evolutionary pattern of EV71 over a 7-year period in Hong Kong. EV71 isolates detected from 22 patients in Hong Kong during 2004\u20132010 were subject to partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D gene sequencing and analysis. Since initial phylogenetic analysis using the partial gene regions suggested the presence of potential recombination events in EV71 of subgenotype C4 (proposed genotype D) and a separate lineage of subgenotype C2 in Hong Kong, we performed complete genome sequencing on eight EV71 strains and complete VP1 gene sequencing on 22 EV71 isolates in Hong Kong for further analysis.",

Further analysis showed that the 20 EV71 subgenotype C4 strains were clustered with EV71 genotype B strains for partial 2C region (Figure 1C), but with EV71 subgenotype B3 strains and CVA16 prototype strain G-10 for partial 3D region (Figure 1D). Such incongruent phylogenetic relationships observed among different partial gene regions of our 20 EV71 subgenotype C4 strains suggested that these strains may belong to a newly proposed genotype D, which may have arisen from intra- and inter-typic recombinations as described previously [15]. On the other hand, the two EV71 subgenotype C2 strains, V08-2231530 and V08-2236079, were clustered with other subgenotype C2 strains for partial 2C and 3D regions (Figure 1C and 1D), indicating that they belonged to subgenotype C2. The result showed that except the two EV71 strains belonging to subgenotype C2, all EV71 strains from Hong Kong during 2004\u20132010 included in this study belonged to subgenotype C4 (proposed genotype D), revealing that \u201cgenotype D\u201d was the predominant genotype persistently circulating in our population.",

            "text": "The present study is the first report of the emergence of EV71 \u201cdouble-recombinant\u201d strains belonging to the newly proposed genotype D in Hong Kong. We have previously showed that intratypic and intertypic recombination events have occurred in EV71 strains, SZ/HK08-5 and SZ/HK08-6, and other subgenotype C4 strains, which represent the new genotype D [15]. Although the functional relevance of the \u201cdouble recombination\u201d events in EV71 remains unclear, we speculate that the acquisition of replicative components, such as helicase, protease and polymerase, from EV71 genotype B strain and CVA16 strain in EV71 subgenotype C4 strain may confer evolutionary advantages on EV71 \u201cdouble-recombinant\u201d strains of \u201cgenotype D\u201d. Further studies are warranted to investigate the role of the recombinations in the \u201cgenotype D\u201d strains. In the present study, the incongruent phylogenetic relationships among the 5\u2032UTR, P1, P2 and P3 regions of the subgenotype C4 strains, together with results of similarity plot and bootscan analyses, confirmed that these strains belonged to the \u201cdouble-recombinant\u201d, newly proposed genotype D. Such incongruities observed in EV71 phylogenetic trees when comparing structural and non-structural regions of the genomes were similar to those demonstrated in a recent study [23], which showed that a mosaic of incongruent patterns for EV71 were likely due to the independent evolutionary pathways of the two genome regions of EV71. Traditionally, many studies have reported the use of structural gene sequences [4,24,25], particularly VP1 gene, for EV71 genotype and subgenotype determination. However, VP1 gene sequence mainly provides information on the serotype of EV71 and it encompasses only about one-tenth of the entire genome. On the other hand, using whole genome sequence for EV71 genotyping seems to be more appropriate because it consists of not only structural region encoding sequences, but also non-structural region encoding sequences and untranslated regions at 5\u2032 and 3' termini. In addition, recombination commonly occurred in enteroviruses [10-12,15], such as EV71 subgenotype C4 strains, which were shown to cluster with other subgenotype C strains for 5\u2032UTR and P1, but not for P2 and P3 regions (Figure 2). Furthermore, in other positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the generation of novel genotypes of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as a result of the recombination between different genotypes has been reported [26,27]. Renaming subgenotype C4 as genotype D was also supported by another study [19], in which the complete genome sequences of subgenotype C4 strains were shown to have a nucleotide divergence of 17-20% that exceeded the average cut-off divergence of 14.95% for subgenotyping. Similar nucleotide divergence (17\u201318.9%) of the 7 subgenotype C4 strains in the present study was also demonstrated when compared to other EV71 strains of subgenotype C1, C2, C3 and C5 using complete genome sequences. A combination of VP1 and 3D gene sequences was proposed to be used for initial genotyping of EV71 isolates in the absence of complete genome sequences [19]. In 2001, an EV71 isolate from a patient with acute flaccid paralysis in India has also been proposed to belong to genotype D [28,29]. However, complete genome sequence data were lacking for more detailed phylogenetic and genome analysis of this Indian strain. As VP1 gene clustering closely resembles the serotype designation of enteroviruses, VP1 gene should be sequenced for EV71 genotyping in any circumstances. However, using VP1 gene alone may be insufficient for genotyping the EV71 recombinants. Thus, sequencing of at least three regions, probably one from P1, one from P2 and one from P3, is only required for genotyping the EV71 strains with recombination, and this will help future assignment of genotypes for enteroviruses.",

Among the 22 EV71 isolates collected in this study, 20 belonged to \u201cgenotype D\u201d and two belonged to subgenotype C2, indicating that \u201cgenotype D\u201d was the predominant type of EV71 in our locality over the 7-year period. This is consistent with an epidemiological study showing that subgenotype C4 (\u201cgenotype D\u201d) was the major type of EV71 circulating in Hong Kong since 1998 [21]. Persistent circulation of subgenotype C4 strains was also noted in China during 1998\u20132010 [31]. We found that the complete genome sequences of the 7 subgenotype C4 strains in Hong Kong were highly similar to those in China, with nucleotide sequence identity of >90%. As Hong Kong is well connected to China, this may facilitate the spread of subgenotype C4 strains from mainland China to Hong Kong. The reasons for the recent EV71 epidemics in Hong Kong due to the same genotype of virus, \u201cgenotype D\u201d, remain to be determined. One possible explanation is that immune response against EV71 in individuals may decrease over time, leading to an accumulation of susceptible individuals, in turn facilitating the transmission of EV71 \u201cgenotype D\u201d in our population. Further study is warranted to determine if lower seroprevalence is noted in a year prior to each EV71 epidemic. Another reason for a surge in the number of EV71 cases could be owing to the antigenic changes of EV71 [17]. However, when comparing the amino acid sequences of VP1 of the 20 \u201cgenotype D\u201d strains from Hong Kong, they were highly identical with conserved amino acid residues in the BC loop essential for interaction with neutralizing antibodies. The high degree of conservation in the immunogenic VP1 protein of \u201cgenotype D\u201d strains raises the possibility of developing a vaccine against this predominant genotype in Hong Kong and mainland China, which may help protect young children at high risk.",

The earliest characterized subgenotype C4 strain SHZH98 is in cluster b, but for more systematic classification (usually based on chronological order), the older and recent strains should belong to cluster a and b respectively. Since the late 1990s, EV71 subgenotype C4 strains have been frequently reported in Asian countries [22,32-37]. The subgenotype C4 was further divided into two clusters, C4b and C4a [22,37], which are better to be renamed as genotypes D1a and D1b respectively. In the present study, EV71 \u201cgenotype D\u201d strains in Hong Kong have been stably evolving during 2004\u20132010, with a shift from \u201cgenotype D1a\u201d (2004 and 2006) to \u201cgenotype D1b\u201d (2004\u20132010). From the results of the present study, no correlation was found between genotypes of EV71 and disease severity, though a recent study from China showed that C4a strains (proposed genotype D1b) caused more severe diseases in patients with HFMD than C4b strains (proposed genotype D1a) [22].",

EV71 subgenotype C2 was first detected in Australia in 1995 [38] and three years later, this predominant type circulating in Taiwan led to a devastating outbreak [39]. From the phylogenetic analysis of VP1 in the present study, two EV71 strains from Hong Kong, V08-2231530 and V08-2236079, detected in 2008 shared a high nucleotide sequence identity with other subgenotype C2 strains in recent years (2006\u20132008), forming a cluster separate from the subgenotype C2 strains discovered in the 1990s (Figure 4). This was in line with the result of a study showing that recent subgenotype C2 strains from the Netherlands and United Kingdom formed a clade distinct from a group of \u201cold\u201d strains detected in the Netherlands, Taiwan and the United States, with high bootstrap support of 100% [9]. Current classification of EV71 genotypes using VP1 gene sequences showed that the average nucleotide sequence divergences between and within subgenotypes were 10.1% and 3.6% respectively [19]. In the present study, the average nucleotide divergence between \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d subgenotype C2 strains was 4.6%, which lies between the two mean cut-off values, suggesting the emergence of a distinct lineage of subgenotype C2 strains in Hong Kong. The minority of EV71 subgenotype C2 strains detected only in 2008 in Hong Kong could be due to the importation of this subgenotype from neighboring countries, including mainland China [40]. Further epidemiological and genomic studies are required to identify the emergence of novel types of EV71 and assess their potential in causing epidemics in the near future.",

            "text": "To better understand the evolution of EV71, evolutionary rates and divergence dates of EV71 were also examined using VP1 gene sequence. VP1 gene was chosen because it shows a high degree of genetic diversity and no recombination has been mapped within VP1 gene [41], while recombination within 5'UTR, P2 and P3 regions is frequent in EV71 [15,17,22]. The evolutionary rate of EV71 was 3.1 \u00d7 10-3 s/s/y comparable to that of other enterovirus, such as EV68 (4.93 \u00d7 10-3 s/s/y) [42], but was lower than those of echovirus 30 (8.3 \u00d7 10-3 s/s/y) [43] and poliovirus (1.03 \u00d7 10-2 s/s/y for P1 region), with the latter shown to be the highest rate among picornaviruses [44]. Molecular clock analysis using VP1 gene sequences suggested that the tMRCA of all EV71 genotypes most likely emerged in the 1900s (mean: 1905), which was similar to that shown in a study from China (mean: 1911) [22], but was different from that demonstrated in another study (mean: 1941) [45], it is probably due to different sample sizes and model parameters used in the analyses. While the tMRCA of genotype B and C in the 1920s (mean: 1925), that of genotype B in the 1950s (mean: 1953), that of genotype A in the late 1960s (mean: 1967), and that of genotype C in the early 1970s (mean: 1972). A recent study has demonstrated the tMRCA for EV71 strains of subgenotypes C4a and C4b [22], but authors did not notice that recombination events have occurred in these strains, which can bias estimates of the tMRCA [46]. Although the tMRCA of the EV71 \u201cdouble-recombinant\u201d strains of \u201cgenotype D\u201d could not be determined by molecular clock analysis, the detection of \u201cgenotype D\u201d strains from Hong Kong and mainland China from year 1998 suggested that this genotype has emerged not later than this year. Since EV71 keeps on evolving via mutation and recombination [15,19], molecular surveillance is of vital importance in monitoring the genetic variations of circulating EV71 strains and the emergence of new types or recombinants of EV71.",

Phylogenetic tree construction was performed using ML method in MEGA5 with the best models K2+G for 5\u2032UTR and TN93+G+I for P1, P2 and P3 regions [47], with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 trees. Recombination analysis was conducted using a nucleotide alignment of the genome sequences of our EV71 strains, EV71 genotype A prototype strain BrCr (GenBank accession no.

The mixtures were amplified by using 40 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 50 s, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min, in an automated thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Phylogenetic tree of VP1 gene sequences (Additional file 5: Table S4) was constructed using ML method in MEGA5 with the best model K2+G+I [47], with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 trees. Divergence times for EV71 genotypes A, B and C were calculated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as implemented in BEAST (Version 1.7.4) as described elsewhere [22,49]. Exponential growth population size coalescent was used as tree prior. Analysis was performed under the best substitution model GTR+I determined by ModelGenerator [50] for VP1 gene sequence data using a lognormal relaxed molecular clock. The MCMC analysis was run for 2 \u00d7 108 generations and sampled every 1000 steps. Convergence was assessed on the basis of the effective sampling size after a 10% burn-in using Tracer software Version 1.5 [49]. The mean tMRCA and the highest posterior density regions at 95% (HPD) were calculated. The trees were summarized in a target tree by the Tree Annotator program included in the BEAST package by choosing the tree with the maximum sum of posterior probabilities (maximum clade credibility) after a 10% burn-in.",
