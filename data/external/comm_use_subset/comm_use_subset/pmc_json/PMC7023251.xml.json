            "text": "Drug resistance in pathogenic microbes is an emerging challenge in crop production and human health care [1,2]. Multiresistant bacteria have many strategies that threaten the health of animals and plants [3], such as beta-lactamases that are enzymes synthesized by bacteria to break host resistance [4]. This situation has been provoked by the recent attention paid to identifying new antimicrobial genes against emerging bacterial resistance [5]. Therefore, scientists have been trying to discover novel biocontrol agents to overcome this problem. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have received a considerable amount of attention because of their significant activity against fungi, bacteria, parasites, viruses, inflammation, and tumor cells [6,7]. It is generally believed that AMPs are short peptides (20\u201350 amino acids) with low molecular weight and mostly linear cationic \u03b1-helices [8], with effective activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens. AMPs can be isolated from a variety of organisms such as bacteria, fungi, insects, plants, animals, and humans [9,10]. As a new class of antibiotic with low tendency to induce resistance, high antimicrobial activity, and good selectivity, AMPs have the potential to replace some traditional antibiotics in the future [11]. The Gram-positive bacterial cell envelope is composed of an outer cell wall (a thick peptidoglycan layer and a polysaccharide coat) and an inner cytoplasmic membrane. To achieve their bactericidal activities, AMPs interact with the cell wall or cytomembrane, resulting in membrane interruption and cell lysis [12]. In most of these cases, AMPs are reported to cause disruptions in cell wall or cell membrane integrity, perforation, deformation, and increased water ion and molecular flow across the membrane, which ultimately causes microbial death [13].",

To avoid the propensity for resistance genes to be overcome by pathogens, we designed a model in which pathogen-independent, nonself-recognition triggered, and heterosis-based fresh resistance can be generated in F1 hybrids [26]. To the best of our knowledge, I. indigotica has been less well documented for its antimicrobial potential. In the current study, novel AMPs were identified from I. indigotica using the B. subtilis expression system, and further studies were performed to explore their antibacterial and antifungal activities.

Cell staining was observed by confocal imaging. Under an ordinary optical microscope, rod-shaped bacterial cells were observed for both the control and transformed strains (Figure 2b).

Propidium iodide (PI) uptake increases with an increase in cell membrane permeability. Dot plots showed that the B. subtilis WB800-e strain had minimal PI staining (approximately 1.75%).

            "text": "For the isolation of novel AMPs, we established a new, sensitive, and high-throughput strategy based on the damaging or killing effects of peptides against B. subtilis host cells [25]. A drawback of this strategy is that strong AMPs will kill B. subtilis cells too rapidly to detect the clones, and therefore, only AMPs with weak killing effects are preferred. However, B. subtilis has a good secretory system, which may reduce the toxicity of strong AMPs. Additionally, during the first few hours (12 h), the concentration of strong AMPs is possibly not high enough to kill the cells, making the selection of strong AMPs feasible. In our study, part of the B. subtilis system selected AMPs that did not actually show a strong effect on B. subtilis cells; however, the selected AMPs did show strong antimicrobial activity against other pathogens. Although the selection of AMPs with weak killing effects is preferred, the B. subtilis screening system has the ability to select for cell membrane-interrupting antimicrobial peptides that inhibit a broad range of pathogens. This strategy was used for the screening of AMPs from the Chinese herbal plant, I. indigotica, which was previously reported for its high antimicrobial activities [46] and other health-related benefits [47]. In this study, we identified 45 different candidates from I. indigotica with the potential to induce autolysis of Bacillus cells. Out of the 45 candidates, two different peptides, IiR515 and IiR915, that exhibited strong antimicrobial activities were selected for further study. These two peptides were considered to be novel because they had no homology in NCBI BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches or the antimicrobial peptide database (APD) (Figure S4).

In our study, SEM observations and confocal microscopy images showed cytomembrane damage, including shrinkage, distortion, pore formation, and ruptures. Cytometric analysis of IiR515- and IiR915-transformed Bacillus cells showed the same results and were supported by previous studies [50]. Propidium iodide can penetrate broken cell membranes and cause the majority of cells to emit red fluorescence. Cytomembrane breakage always accompanies intracellular component outflow, such as nucleic acids, which can be detected in the extracellular environment. Cell membrane damages also correlate with membrane fluidity and changes in electrical potential, as our results show. We treated the genomes of different pathogens with these peptides, but they did not cause DNA degradation. Based on our findings, we assume the possible mechanism of the IiR515 and IiR915 peptides was to interrupt or rupture the cell membrane. ",

Bacillus subtilis clones exhibiting antimicrobial activities were identified on the basis of the proteins that accumulated inside the cells and caused cell autolysis. Correct guidance by signal peptides can ensure successful secretion of different proteins [51]. Bacillus subtilis 168 is the most popular host for the expression of heterogenous proteins, and it is a biocontrol agent [52] that can secrete many extracellular proteases to degrade extracellular proteins. In contrast, the strain used in this study was B. subtilis WB800, which has mutations in eight key extracellular proteases to reduce the degradation of extracellular proteins [53]. There are several methods that exist for cDNA library construction, which have a significant influence on the experimental results. Many of the methods require PCR amplification to increase the abundance of cDNAs. However, there is a major drawback with these methods, in that a large number of repeated genes are selected in subsequent steps; however, in our present method, PCR amplification is not required to increase the abundance of the cDNA library.",

Both the IiR515 and IiR915 peptides were consistent with previously reported AMPs because of their significant inhibitory effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentration for recombinant pBD142 were 100 \u00b5g/mL and 80 \u00b5g/mL against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Similarly, the MIC for AMP CAP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. ranged from 30 to 550 \u00b5g/mL against a wide range of pathogens [36,54]. Minimum inhibitory concentration for our peptides revealed that they were similar to the previously reported AMPs. However, on the other hand, the inhibition activity of our peptides was not observed as strong as for vancomycin [55]. Phytophthora capsici is a pathogenic oomycete which is hemi-biotrophic and has a broad range of hosts. It can infect most of the Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae crops [56]. Disks containing P. capsici were used to inoculate N. benthamiana leaves for pathogenicity analysis by observation of necrotic lesions [57]. Our results demonstrated that IiR515 and IiR915 enhanced the resistance of N. benthamiana towards P. capsici. These two peptides were then ligated into the pTRV2Ex (viral vector) vector, and we observed that they had the potential to improve the resistance of N. benthamiana towards B. cinerea. Previous studies have shown that the use of viral vectors can produce a huge quantity of AMPs in plant systems to efficiently reduce pathogen attack [58], as was observed in our study.",

Additionally, different bioassays using C. elegans were performed to assess the toxicity of IiR515 and IiR915 against nematodes [60]. Although the IiR515 and IiR915 peptides have effects on the food tropism of C. elegans, these two peptides did not show any killing effect on C. elegans. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the number of offspring or the body length (Supplementary toxicity assay and Figure S5). Therefore, we speculated that these two peptides obtained from I. indigotica are relatively safe for animal cells and may also be safe for humans. These results indicate the possibility for the application of AMPs to animals and humans in the future.",
