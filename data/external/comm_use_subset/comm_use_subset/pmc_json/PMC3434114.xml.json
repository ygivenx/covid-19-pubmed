A predominance of type 2b in herds having PCV2 associated diseases (PCVAD) has been described in several countries in Europe and in North America, while PCV2a has been recovered before PCVAD were recorded in Canada, in non-PCVAD affected farms in the USA and in healthy animals in Switzerland [2,3].

Tissue pools were analysed for PCV2 by PCR using the primer pair Fa/Ra, which amplifies a 476 bp fragment [4]. PCV2 positive samples were additionally tested for Brucella spp, Leptospira spp. and. porcine parvovirus (PPV) by PCR. Brucella spp. DNA was detected using the genus specific primer pair ITS66/ITS279 [7]. The PCR assay for the detection of Leptospira spp. was conducted using the primer pair Lep1/Lep2, which amplifies a 331 bp fragment from the 16S rRNA gene of Leptospira spp [8]. Finally, PPV DNA amplification was achieved using a pair of primers directed to the VP2 sense/antisense template that amplifies a 197 bp fragment [9]. To avoid false-negative PCR results due to failures during DNA isolation or the presence of PCR inhibitors, the extracted DNA was tested in parallel for the amplification of \u03b2-actin as a PCR control [10]. Positive controls (PCV2, PPV, Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. templates) and negative controls (sterilised MilliQ water) were used in each reaction. McNemar\u2019s test for the comparison of paired proportions was used to determine the significance of differences (P < 0.05) between PCV2 positive samples and presence of the other organisms.",

However, no repeatable characteristic amino acid motifs in the PCV2 capsid protein or in the residues used for genotype classification were associated with clinical disease. The results are consistent with previous field and experimental reports, in which both genotypes have been detected and were able to induce similar gross lesions and virus replication rates as those described in PCV2 associated reproductive disorders [13,14].",

Most field reports are based on accidental findings by diagnostic laboratories. Although the samples studied here were collected in PCV2 positive swine herds that had other clinical signs of PCVAD than reproductive failure, PCV2 was detected as a mono-infection in only 3.57% of the samples. The prevalence of dual or triple infections including PCV2 was higher (7.2%). Previous studies performed in Brazil have failed to detect PCV2 in samples from incidents of reproductive failures or only detected PCV2 at similar low levels (5.74%) [14-16]. The low rate of PCV2 detection in the cases studied here is similar to rates found in other studies [17]. However, the importance of the virus in some incidents of reproductive failure has been demonstrated by Lyoo et al. [18], who detected mono-infection with PCV2 in 4/16 aborted foetuses in Korea. The role for PCV2 in reproductive failure was also reported from the Czech Republic, where the frequency of PCV2 isolation in association with reproductive failure increased from 2005 to 2007 [19]. The discrepancies between studies may be associated with the PCV2 load in the herds and the time of infection of gilts as demonstrated by Hansen et al[14]. Occurrence of PCV2 associated reproductive disorders is more common in gilts or in new herds that have recently been exposed to the virus [5].",

A number of studies have reported co-infections with PCV2 and PPV, and PPV has been established as an important virus involved in PCV2 associated reproductive failure [17,18]. Co-infections between PCV2 and Brucella spp. has not been reported previously. Despite a national control program for brucellosis in Brazil, the organism was detected in 10/18 PCV2 positive samples. Because of the importance of Brucella spp. as a zoonotic agent, farmers with herds that were positive for brucellosis were notified of their status to improve brucellosis control.",
