Fetuin contains mono-, bi-, and tri-antennary glycans carrying both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 SIAs23. Binding of HA to fetuin was detected both for the teal and human H7 proteins, albeit with different efficiencies (Fig. 1A). The binding of the human H7 protein was significantly less efficient than that of the teal H7 protein (Fig. 1B). For comparison, the H5 (derived from an avian H5N1 virus) and H1 (derived from a seasonal human H1N1 virus) proteins, which were previously shown to specifically bind to \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 SIAs, respectively2124, were also included. Binding of H5 to fetuin was more efficient than that of the H1 protein, which displayed similar binding to fetuin as the human H7 protein. We also analyzed the ability of the different recombinant proteins using hemagglutination assays with chicken, human or horse erythrocytes. (supplementary Fig. S2). The human H7 protein agglutinated both human and chicken erythrocytes, but to a lesser extent than the teal H7 or the H5 protein. The human H7 protein did not agglutinate horse erythrocytes. The H1 protein only showed appreciable agglutination of human erythrocytes. These results show that the human and teal H7 proteins have different receptor-binding properties. Whether this also reflects a difference in binding specificity (\u03b12-3 versus alpha \u03b12-6 SIA) will be addressed below. Furthermore, the hemagglutination assays indicate differences in receptor binding between the human H7 and H1 proteins.",

The teal N9 protein consistently displayed a significantly higher sialidase activity than the human N9 protein and less N9 protein was needed for half maximal PNA binding (EC50 of 0.01380 vs 0.029 \u03bcg, P < 0.001). In agreement herewith, the teal protein more efficiently reduced the binding of the \u03b12-3 SIA-specific lectin MAL I compared to the human protein (Fig. 2B). However, both proteins were equally inefficient in the removal of \u03b12-6 SIAs, as incubation of fetuin with these proteins resulted in negligible reduction in binding of the \u03b12-6 SIA-specific lectin SNA, compared to a control N1 protein (Fig. 2C). Thus, compared to the teal virus, the human H7N9 virus not only carries an HA protein that displays less efficient binding to fetuin, it also contains an NA protein that is less active.",

We focused on the region of the HA protein that comprises the 130 loop, 190 helix and 220 loop, which forms the receptor binding site. This region contains seven amino acid differences between the teal and human H7 proteins (supplementary Fig. S3). With the exception of the A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) virus, these seven substitutions were consistently found in all human H7N9 viruses. Also most novel avian H7N9 viruses contain these mutations.",

            "text": "Teal H7 proteins that contained each of these mutations were expressed, purified, and tested for fetuin binding. Most mutations had little effect on the ability of the teal H7 protein to bind to fetuin. One mutation caused a modest but significant increase (G186V) in fetuin binding, while another mutation (Q226L) severely decreased the binding of the H7 protein (Fig. 3A and supplementary Fig. S4). Next, we tested different combinations of mutations. In general, amino acid substitutions in addition to those at position 186 or 226 did not affect the fetuin-binding properties of the resulting proteins much compared to the 186 and 226 single mutant proteins. Only when the mutations at position 186 and 226 were combined was a fetuin-binding phenotype similar to that of the human H7 protein observed. (Fig. 3B and supplementary Fig. S4). Binding of this double mutant protein was significantly higher than that of the Q226L single mutant protein (P < 0.001). Introduction of two additional substitutions in the H7 protein already carrying both G186V and Q226L did not significantly affect fetuin binding compared to the G186V and Q226L double mutant. In agreement with the important role for the residues at position 186 and 226 in the teal protein for fetuin binding, reciprocal substitutions at positions 186 and 226 in the background of the human H7 protein resulted in significantly decreased (V186G) and increased (L226Q) fetuin binding (Fig. 3C and supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, single substitutions at position 186 and 226 in the background of the human H7 protein are sufficient to obtain fetuin-binding properties that are similar to single mutant teal proteins (compare H7/Human L226Q with H7/Teal G186V [P > 0.7] and H7/Human V186G with H7/Teal Q226L [P > 0.3]). In general, the fetuin-binding properties of the recombinant proteins correlated with the ability of these proteins to agglutinate red blood cells (supplementary Fig. S2). Although we cannot exclude that other substitutions may also affect fetuin binding, we conclude that the differences in fetuin binding between the human and teal H7 proteins can be mostly attributed to substitutions at position 186 and 226.",

The human H7 protein displayed significantly increased binding to a subset of \u03b12-6 and surprisingly also \u03b12-8-linked SIA-containing glycans when compared to the teal protein. In contrast, binding to \u03b12-3 sialosides was strongly decreased but still stronger when compared to binding to \u03b12-6-containing glycans.

Previously, others have shown that human viruses with a preference for \u03b12-6 SIAs are able to bind to epithelial cells lining the upper respiratory tract (URT)1126. These human viruses are also able to bind to cells of the lower respiratory tract (LRT). Viruses that prefer binding to \u03b12-3 SIAs are able to bind to cells of the LRT, because of the presence of \u03b12-3 SIAs in the LRT, but not to the epithelial cells of the URT. Indeed, comparable results were obtained by performing recombinant HA histochemistry on human tissues using the H1 and the H5 protein (Fig. 5). The H1/Kentucky protein of the seasonal influenza virus, which was previously shown by microarray analysis to bind to \u03b12-6 SIAs only21, displayed efficient binding to the cilia of the human trachea epithelium. In the lung, the H1 protein bound to the ciliated epithelium of the bronchiole and to type I pneumocytes. In contrast, the H5 protein, which only binds to \u03b12-3 SIAs24, did not demonstrate appreciable binding to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea, although efficient binding to submucosal glands was observed. In the LRT, the H5 protein displayed binding to the cilia of the bronchiole, to type II pneumocytes (Fig. 5) and occasionally to macrophages (data not shown). The teal H7 protein showed a similar binding pattern as the H5 protein and bound to submucosal glands and type II pneumocytes, consistent with the expression of \u03b12-3 sialosides on these cells27. In contrast, the human H7 protein only showed efficient binding to the submucosal glands. Hardly any binding was observed to the cilia of the bronchiole and to pneumocytes, in agreement with the reduced receptor-binding avidity of this protein. No staining was observed in the absence of HA (mock).",

            "text": "Pandemics of influenza A virus are caused by viruses that suddenly appear from animal reservoirs, to which most humans have no immunity and which are able to efficiently transmit between humans. A prerequisite for efficient human-to-human transmission is the ability of the virus to specifically bind to \u03b12-6-linked SIAs present in the upper respiratory tract. In view of the concerns raised by the novel human H7N9 virus we analyzed the receptor binding properties of this virus. The results indicate that, in comparison to avian H7N9 virus, the human H7N9 virus displays increased binding to \u03b12-6 as well as \u03b12-8 sialosides and reduced binding to \u03b12-3-linked SIAs. Still, whereas all seasonal/pandemic IAVs bind more efficiently to \u03b12-6- than to \u03b12-3-linked sialosides, the human H7 protein binds more efficiently to \u03b12-3- than \u03b12-6-linked SIAs and is not able to efficiently bind to epithelial cells of human trachea. From these results we conclude that the human H7N9 virus has not (yet) adapted its HA protein to such an extent that it results in a receptor-binding profile similar to that of pandemic/seasonal IAV. Our results are in agreement with recent studies that use recombinant H7 proteins to study the ability of the H7N9 viruses to interact with sialosides or to bind to human tissues282930. Also when virions are used for receptor-binding analyses, human H7 viruses display lower avidity for \u03b12-3 sialic acids and a higher avidity for \u03b12-6 sialosides when compared to other avian viruses. In general, binding to \u03b12-6 sialosides appears less than what is observed for human seasonal influenza viruses, which are able to bind to \u03b12-6 but not \u03b12-3 sialosides30313233. These results are in agreement with the limited human-to-human transmission and airborne transmission between ferrets of the human H7N9 virus313334.",

To our knowledge \u03b12-8 sialosides have never been reported to be present on epithelial cells in the respiratory tract or to be able to serve as functional receptors leading to cell entry. Nevertheless, IAVs are likely to encounter \u03b12-8 sialosides present on the molecules described above and thus their potential role as decoy receptor needs to be considered, especially since IAV neuraminidases are not able to cleave \u03b12-8 linkages35.",

The reduced binding to fetuin was compensated by G186V. The observation that a (partial) switch in receptor specificity results in reduced binding of sialosides, which is compensated by mutations at other positions in the HA protein, also appears to occur for other HA proteins. Mutations in H5 required for airborne transmission between ferrets not only include mutations responsible for a switch in receptor specificity, but also the loss of a N-linked glycosylation site at position 158713.

Strikingly, almost all novel avian H7N9 viruses already carry the Q226L and G186V mutations, indicating that mutations that increase binding to human-like receptors may be obtained by IAVs in an avian host. The increased ability of such viruses to replicate in humans may promote the acquirement of subsequent substitutions that increase \u03b12-6 binding. Additional mutations, required for a full switch, have been described for H2, H3 and H5 viruses. While human H2 and H3 viruses have obtained the G228S substitution42, for H5 an alternative mutation (N224K) may also suffice13. A scenario of stepwise development of optimal binding has a precedent in the observed evolution of the H2N2 pandemic. H2N2 viruses isolated from humans during the first year (1957) of the \u201cAsian\u201d pandemic had not yet obtained the G228S substitution and show lower avidity towards human-like receptors42. Probably, these viruses had not yet acquired the optimal SIA-binding properties for efficient human-to-human transmission. Likewise, the inability of the novel H7N9 viruses to efficiently transmit between humans so far, is probably related with the incomplete switch in receptor specificity that we observed for this virus.",
