These included 15 patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit and requiring mechanical ventilator support and 26 suffering from mild respiratory symptoms. All the mild cases were ambulatory patients admitted to a designated hospital. In the initial phases of the pandemic during which this study was performed, patients suggestive of Influenza-like illness were admitted to designated ward of a Corporation hospital. Throat swabs were collected and sent to the National Institute of Virology for diagnosis. Osletamivir treatment was initiated immediately after the confirmation of diagnosis. These patients were discharged after the completion of the treatment. On the contrary, majority of the severe patients were admitted only after the development of serious respiratory consequences. Same protocol was followed for diagnosis and antiviral treatment.",

Therefore, we could collect samples before the initiation of the antiviral therapy and the data truly represents acute phase of mild disease. On the other hand, critically ill patients were given Oseltamivir immediately after the confirmation of the infection and the samples were collected subsequently.

In contrast, among the Spanish patients [10], 93% and 57% of the mild and critical cases respectively were positive for serum viral RNA, with no significant difference in the viral load. Both studies used CDC primers for real time PCR (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/CDCRealtimeRTPCRprotocol_SwineH1Ass-2009_20090428) and the critical cases were bled when already on Oseltamivir treatment, negating sensitivity of the PCR, effect of antiviral therapy or delay in collection of samples to be responsible for different results.

Poor outcome despite the switch may probably be attributed to the timing of the shift or role of antibodies in disease severity. Significantly higher titres of IgG-anti-p-H1N1-09 antibodies in the critically ill patients supports the role in pathogenesis. This observation is in sharp contrast with that for the SARS patients examined from Canada [13] documenting significantly lower anti-SARS CoV spike antibody titres in the critically ill patients. Though the presence of neutralizing antibodies protect against Influenza virus infection, clearance of the infection is mediated by cellular immunity. The exclusive presence of IgG1 antibodies in both patient categories document Th2 bias with significant enhancement with severity. This observation correlates with the elevated levels of TLR3, 4, and 7, Th2 cytokines (IL6 and IL10) at protein level and IL4, IL5, IL6, IL10 at gene level.",

IL10 is recognized as a regulatory (anti-inflammatory) cytokine and can act on multiple cell types to regulate immune and inflammatory responses [15]. IL6 is known to be responsible for regulating plasma levels of IL1RA and IL10 [16]. Among Spanish patients, serum IL15, IL12p70 and IL6 were recognized as the hallmark of severity [10]. Significant increases in TLR levels without corresponding rise in cytokines suggest aberrant immune response in critically ill patients. The possibility of viral proteins diminishing cytokine production cannot be ruled out. Similar to in-vitro studies [17], [18], cytokine storm associated with pathogenesis of H5N1 infection [12] was not the feature of p-H1N1-09 infection. The observations of no increase in the levels of plasma IFNG in both patient categories when compared to controls as well as basal gene expression in the lungs of critically ill patients point out lack of co-ordination in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.",

Comparison of the human data presented in our study (Table S1) shows that in the lungs of the critically ill patients all these and several other chemokines/inflammatory cytokines are over-expressed. Thus, the gene expression profiles at the time of overwhelming symptoms in the lungs of the infected ferrets (decreased expression) do not match the data on severe human cases from the present series (elevated expressions).",

In-depth studies to understand the role of virus/viral proteins in modulating host response need to be undertaken on priority. Identification of specific pathways might provide clues to include immunomodulators for the treatment of severe cases, albeit in conjunction with potent antivirals.",
