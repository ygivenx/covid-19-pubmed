            "text": "In 2003, a sudden outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred in China. More public health emergencies such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009 and the H7N9 avian flu epidemic in 2013 had serious impacts on China\u2019s politics, economy, trade, and people\u2019s health, among others. Theory and implementation of health emergency systems have evolved worldwide. China has gradually implemented the construction of a comprehensive emergency management system including the use of theoretical models, assessment systems, and response studies. China\u2019s health emergency management system is an important component of the comprehensive emergency management system, and health emergency management assessment is an important part of the health emergency management system. China\u2019s health emergency management assessment system has experienced many rigorous tests in response to a series of public health emergencies and has accumulated experience in detecting health emergencies and managing the weaknesses of the evaluation system. There are many types of health emergency management assessments and many methods for health emergency management assessment in China, and the dimensions and the indicators of health emergency management assessment are complex. For example, the evaluation system named the \u201cDisease control agency health emergency capacity evaluation index\u201d has three dimensions, the system known as the \u201cEvaluation index for public health emergency response capacity of township hospitals\u201d has two dimensions, the system named the \u201cNational Health and Family Planning Commission, Health Assessment Capacity Assessment Standard\u201d only has one dimension, the system called \u201cA comprehensive assessment tool of the ability of all provinces, autonomous regions (municipalities)/prefectures (states) to respond to public health emergencies\u201d has 214 indicators, and the evaluation system named the \u201cCompetency model of health emergency personnel in county-level disease control institutions\u201d only has four indicators. In general, the dimensions of health emergency assessment are mostly second-level dimensions. The assessment indicators mainly include management capabilities, improvement capabilities, drill capabilities, and reporting capabilities. For purposes of this research, a \u201cdimension\u201d refers to the content of public health emergency management features of the institution, such as health emergency response dimension, and \u201cindicator\u201d is used to refer to evaluation features, including emergency command coordination mechanism. After the establishment of the National Emergency Management Department, it was necessary to pay attention to the differences and the connections between the health emergency and the national emergency laws and policies. It is necessary to improve the relevance of the entire process of the health emergency management assessment system. The practical application of the health emergency management assessment system also should focus on the application of health supervision agencies, schools, and other institutions. China includes a vast territory, a substantial population, and diverse regional cultures. In May 2005, the 58th World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted International Health Regulations [2005] (hereinafter \u201cIHR\u201d or \u201cthe Regulations\u201d), which were subsequently implemented on 15 June 2007. All state parties are required by the IHR to develop certain minimum core public health capacities. The development of China\u2019s health emergency research has played an important role in promoting the development of global health emergency systems. Systematic evaluation as a method produces high-quality evidence, and its application in the collection and the production of scientific evidence in health emergency management assessment research serves to effectively guarantee the quality of research results, providing a scientific reference for researchers and policymakers. This study analyzes the characteristics of health emergency management assessment indicators using a qualitative system evaluation to appraise the current status of assessment in China as well as to provide evidence-based research for global health emergency policy development.",

According to the type, the scope, and the research purpose of health emergency management combined with a preliminary search of China\u2019s domestic health emergency management assessment literature, two parts of search strategies were identified. The first part included literature encompassing health emergency, public health emergencies, and health and epidemic prevention, and the second part included evaluation, assessment, monitoring, and performance. Each part of the search terms were connected by the logical symbol \u201cOR\u201d, and two parts were connected by the logical symbol \u201cAND\u201d to obtain the search results.

            "text": "In health emergency management assessment practice, the types of assessments vary according to different classification criteria such as the purpose, the object, and the content of the assessment as well as the work status [10]. Research clearly indicates that there are a multitude of assessments in China. First, assessments are divided according to purpose, i.e., formative and summative assessments. For example, the evaluation of Yunnan Province\u2019s emergency health response capability and core competence assessment index system at district-level control institutions was performed to guide and advance the progress of assessment targets as well as to provide a formative evaluation of management decisions. On the other hand, in Fujian Province, the study is concerned with the state of performance appraisals regarding public health emergencies and other issues, including formulating (such as plan completion rate, emergency material reserve rate, simulation exercises) overall judgments on the purposes of evaluation institutions, including accountability and summative assessment. Second, health emergency management assessment is divided into several stages, including the preparation stage (i.e., pre-emergency evaluation), the disposal stage, the in-process evaluation, and the recovery stage (i.e., post-emergency evaluation). Thus, a preliminary discussion on the early warning index system for influenza outbreaks, the construction of an evaluation index system for hospital nurses\u2019 public health emergency response capacity, a weighted analysis of emergency public health emergency response evaluation factors, and the evaluation of emergency drill activities in county-level disease control institutions in Nanchang City are all examples of pre-assessment. In contrast, social vulnerability assessments and analyses of significant factors associated with major infectious diseases are concerned with the assessment of the nature, the type, the extent, and the determining factors of public health emergencies, while epidemiological characteristics studies and normative disposal third-party assessments are all considered post-event assessments that focus on recovery, summarizing, and long-term impact. Third, emergency management work assessment can be divided according to health status, i.e., normal and abnormal assessment. For example, the analysis and the evaluation of the present state of affairs of health emergency work in Qinghai Province was a normal assessment of the state of daily management construction, whereas the comprehensive evaluation of public health emergency implementation in the Fujian Province in 2014 was an assessment of the process and the impact of the emergency response. Fourth, assessment is divided according to the evaluation implementation body, i.e., internal and external evaluation. For example, the evaluation of the public health emergency response capacity of F hospital in Qiqihar City was an internal investigation conducted by an investigation team composed of health emergency management agencies and workers. On the other hand, investigating the epidemiological characteristics of public health emergencies and standard treatment third-party assessments are surveys that involve external evaluation from experts outside the health emergency management and work organization.",

Some studies focus on data collection, detailing the main laws and characteristics by using descriptive methods. The health emergency management evaluation system weight analysis and application falls more in the domain of the Delphi method, while analytic hierarchy process, entropy weight, rank sum ratio, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and matter-element extension methods are relatively new methods for health emergency assessment. The application of the health emergency management evaluation involves possibly utilizing questionnaire surveys, factor analysis, principal component analysis, comprehensive scoring, comprehensive indexes, and analytic hierarchy process methods.

In April 2018, the central and the state institutions of China reformed and established the National Emergency Management Department, equipped with primary functions responsible for the management of natural and accidental disasters. Social security incidents were assigned to the Political and Legal Committee, and public health events became the responsibility of the Health Committee. In the future, more comprehensive, targeted, and operational public health events, social security incidents, natural disasters, and accident disasters related laws and regulations and various policy systems will likely be gradually developed, and corresponding event-related authorities will also enhance the supporting plan, the disposal plan, and the process. This study found that the main Chinese environmental laws and regulations utilized in the process of constructing a health emergency assessment system included the Emergency Regulations for Public Health Emergencies, the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Emergency Response, the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, \u201cThe disease prevention and control work performance appraisal operation manual\u201d, the State Council Emergency Office \u201cEmergency Drill Guide\u201d, and so on.
