PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV primarily cause enteric infections in pigs. PRCV is the result of deletion and mutation of the spike gene of TGEV. This virus has a predilection for the respiratory tract, but also has the capacity to produce enteric disease [9]. In contrast, PHEV infection (\"vomiting and wasting disease\") produces encephalomyelitis, rather than enteritis, and thus is not often considered when differentiating enteric infections [6].",

Infection causes epithelial cell degeneration and villous atrophy, which leads to diarrhea, dehydration, and prolonged shedding of PEDV in feces [14\u201315]. PEDV viremia has also been reported during the acute stage of infection in young pigs [14, 16\u201318]. The most common clinical consequence of PEDV infection is diarrhea, i.e. watery and flocculent feces, often accompanied by vomiting [19]. Morbidity and mortality is highly age-dependent, with neonatal pigs the most severely affected. Thus, an outbreak in a na\u00efve swine population may result in 90% mortality in piglets \u2264 2 weeks of age and \u2264 40% mortality in 2- to 4-week-old pigs [12]. This age-dependent variation in mortality is likely the result of slower villus-epithelial repopulation and less developed immune systems in neonatal pigs [15\u201316, 20\u201322]. Experimentally-infected 3-week-old pigs showed a significant reduction in average daily gain during the first week post-inoculation and no compensatory weight gain in the following 4 weeks [15]. In the field, Olanratmanee et al. (2010) reported that PEDV infection in pregnant gilts and sows may also have contributed to reduced reproductive performance, including a 12.6% decrease in farrowing rate, a 5.7% increase in the return rate, a 1.3% increase in the abortion rate, and a 2.0% increase in the number of mummified fetuses per litter [23].",

This concept is primarily derived from research showing that sows with higher anti-TGEV SIgA levels in milk were better able to protect their piglets against clinical TGE [19, 25\u201327]. These observations are the foundation upon which successful TGEV prevention and control strategies have been based for over 50 years [28]. However, dissimilarities between immunity to PEDV versus immunity to TGEV have not been closely examined and deserve investigation. The question addressed in this project was the effect of colostral (passive) antibody on the protection of neonates against PEDV. Specifically, the objective of this experiment was to quantify the impact of circulating anti-PEDV antibody on the course of PEDV replication and clinical disease in the neonatal pig using a passive transfer model.",

All piglets were inoculated with PEDV 24 h later and were then observed daily until day post inoculation (DPI) 14 or until humane euthanasia was necessary. Each day, sow milk and piglet fecal samples and data on piglet clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature were collected. Serum samples were collected from sows at DPIs -7 and 14 and from piglets at DPIs -1, 0, and 14 or at the time of humane euthanasia. Fecal samples were tested by PEDV real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Serum, colostrum, and milk were tested for PEDV IgG, IgA, and virus-neutralizing antibody. The data were evaluated for the effects of systemic PEDV antibody levels on the outcomes measured.",

Specifically, swine serum proteins and serum antibody (IgG and IgA) were precipitated by single fractional precipitation using 30% and then 40% ammonium sulfate, respectively. The entire process was conducted in an environmental chamber (Caron\u00ae, Marietta, OH) maintained at 4\u00b0C. Initially, 2 PEDV naturally (field) exposed sows were acquired from a commercial swine farm. Testing of the pooled sow serum, before antibody purification and concentration, by PEDV WV ELISA resulted in S/P ratios of 5.0 for IgA and 2.6 for IgG. The 2 sows were humanely euthanized and exsanguinated to collect whole blood (ISU #2-14-7736-S). Serum was harvested, and stored in 1 L bottles (Biotainer\u2122, Nalge Nunc Corp., Rochester, NY) at -20\u00b0C. For the first precipitation, the serum was thawed for 24 h at 4\u00b0C, the volume of saturated ammonium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) calculated to achieve 30% concentration was added in a drop-by-drop fashion while stirring continuously, and then the mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 16 h with continued stirring. Following incubation, the mixture was centrifuged (4\u00b0C) at 4,000 x g for 10 min to remove protein aggregates and less soluble proteins. For the second precipitation, the volume of the supernatant (IgM-free antibody fraction) was measured, additional saturated ammonium sulfate was added as before to achieve a final concentration of 40%, and then the mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4\u00b0C with stirring. Thereafter, the mixture was centrifuged (4\u00b0C) at 4,000 x g for 10 min to recover the antibody fraction. The pelleted antibody was gently resuspended with PBS (1X pH 7.4) at a 1:5 (pellet:PBS) volume ratio. To remove salts, the solution was dialyzed in 250 ml dialysis flasks (Pierce\u00ae, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, CA) floating vertically in ~15 liters of 4\u00b0C, continuously stirred PBS (1X pH 7.4). The entire volume of PBS was replaced every 4 h for 5 times and then the antibody solution was concentrated by polyacrylamide gel dialysis (Spectra/Gel\u00ae Absorbent, Spectrum Laboratories, Inc. Rancho Dominguez, CA). The PEDV WV ELISA S/P ratios of the concentrated antibody solution were 3.0 for IgG, and 7.2 for IgA. The concentrated antibody solution was then aliquoted into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and stored at -80\u00b0C until used.",

A similar pattern was observed under the conditions of this experiment. Diarrhea was first observed at one DPI, all fecal samples were PEDV rRT-PCR positive on DPI 2, and mortality commenced on DPI 2. Statistical analyses found that circulating PEDV antibody did not protect piglets from the negative effects of PEDV on growth, reduce or eliminate shedding of PEDV in feces, or affect the humoral immune response against PEDV infection. However, circulating antibody partially ameliorated the effect of PEDV infection on body temperature and improved piglet survivability. Specifically, antibody-positive groups returned to normal body temperature faster (Fig 2b) and demonstrated higher survivability than PEDV antibody-negative control piglets (Fig 2c). These results are compatible with previous reports for swine coronaviruses. Shibata et al. (2001) reported that passive PEDV-specific antibody was effective in preventing PEDV infection and reduced mortality in 2 day-old piglets [51]. Stepanek et al. (1982) demonstrated that the presence of sufficient levels of TGEV-specific passive antibody delayed mortality due to TGEV infection in 4 day-old pigs [52]. The mechanisms responsible for producing these results have not been established, but we hypothesize that one or more of the following four mechanisms may be involved:",
