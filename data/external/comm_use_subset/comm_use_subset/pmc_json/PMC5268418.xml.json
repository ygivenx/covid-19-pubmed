For example, the disease prevention and vector control response to the introduction and local spread of Zika virus infection in the United States is being blunted and hampered by congressional discord. Also, relying on legislation for emergency funds for each outbreak (rather than having a dedicated budget for preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks) is problematic. That said, previous zoonotic pathogen crises provide valuable insights into best practices, and herein, we detail the role of museum biorepositories in disease outbreak investigations. In addition to providing wide taxonomic sampling, museums and associated databases critically tie discoveries of new pathogens to permanent host records and samples and to a series of other informatics resources (e.g., GenBank and GIS applications) that facilitate future exploration, tracking, and mitigation of novel zoonotic pathogens. Because a fundamental requirement for the designation of a new pathogen is precise identification of the reservoir taxon [1], we advocate formal incorporation of museum biorepositories and integrated databases as critical infrastructure for pathogen discovery and pathobiology research.",

However, significant gains in our understanding of these pathogens did not occur until 1993, when an outbreak of a rapidly progressive, frequently fatal respiratory disease, now known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, was caused by Sin Nombre virus, a hantavirus harbored by the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) in the southwestern US [3]. That outbreak marked the beginning of integrated collaborations between public health agencies, virologists, ecologists, and museum scientists that completely reshaped our understanding of hantavirus systematics, evolution, and ecology. This interdisciplinary approach serves as a new model for pathogen discovery (Fig 1) and will be critical going forward as zoonotic pathogens and diseases emerge in the future [4]. Frozen tissues held in natural history museums stimulated discovery of many new hantaviruses in rodents (and, more recently, in shrews, moles, and bats) worldwide [5\u20136].",

Similarly, availability of frozen archives of wild vertebrates in museums permits rapid and efficient screening for diverse zoonotic pathogens and represents a major step forward in assessment, prevention, and mitigation of emerging diseases. Museum biorepositories have rigorous archival and database standards that ensure best practices are followed in pathogen discovery [7]. When new pathogens are described, permanent designation and deposition of host symbiotypes [8] provides a permanent link between samples and data (Fig 2). Macroparasites and microparasites present additional complexity due to their intimate association with particular host taxa. Host\u2013parasite relationships critically require formal recognition to ensure not only that the original sample persists into the future but also that the identity of the pathogen reservoir will not be lost during the dynamic process of taxonomic revision.",

Many other species that serve as pathogen reservoirs are in need of critical taxonomic revision. For viruses, identification of reservoir species is often problematic (e.g., Ebola virus). Therefore, in-depth knowledge of potential hosts, their taxonomic affinities and relationships, and geographic distributions is vital [9].

Science advances as hypotheses are tested, experiments are replicated, and accumulated knowledge is reinterpreted in light of new information, tools, and analyses. Future availability of samples that produced the original, primary data is critical should questions arise regarding their nature, provenance, or taxonomic identity [11]. Over time, a single archived specimen (and associated GenBank sequence) may integrate across dozens of projects and subsequent publications [12], but because most GenBank accessions are not linked to specimens, we are too often unable to replicate or confirm data. With more than 20% of GenBank data potentially misidentified [13], the gold standard for GenBank accessions is now based on the voucher specimen concept [14]. We further advocate that all zoonotic pathogen descriptions provide molecular identification (nucleic acid sequence) for both the host and pathogen so that their identities can readily be placed on the Tree of Life [15] and provide a basis for identifying sister species that may serve as potential hosts for related pathogens.",

When properly archived and digitally captured, museum databases are capable of linking diverse kinds of \u201cbig data.\u201d This biorepository nexus can be a powerful tool for research in pathogen discovery, environmental change, and host\u2013reservoir dynamics. Spatially broad and temporally deep archives of ultra-frozen tissues represent unparalleled infrastructure for virologists, as demonstrated through the retrospective surveys for Sin Nombre hantavirus [16] and subsequent significant new hantavirus discoveries across four continents [5\u20136]. As tools for extracting vast amounts of information from both contemporary and ancient specimens improve [17], new insights into pathogen evolution and ecology will be enhanced [18]. We suggest that the benefits of incorporating this model into pathogen discovery and pathobiology research far outweigh any potential costs associated with its implementation (Box 1).",
