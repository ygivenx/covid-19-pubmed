            "text": "Chen and Pachter [1] defined the analysis of metagenomes as \u201cthe application of modern genomics techniques to the study of communities of microbial organisms directly in their natural environments, bypassing the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species\u201d. Metagenomic applications are significantly supported by the various next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies by reducing the cost per base while simultaneously raising both the throughput and the output. All sequencers feature a massive parallelisation in raw sequence generation mainly differing in their sample preparation and sequence detection method as well as in the required run time. All these technologies enable researchers and diagnosticians to answer various questions ranging from de novo sequencing, whole genome or target-region resequencing, transcriptome research, RNA sequencing and epigenomics to metagenomics [2]. The application of NGS enables unbiased and comprehensive sequencing of genomic material from diverse samples, regardless of origin and composition. Therefore, the generated sequence reads, i.e. short sequences representing individual fragments of the input nucleic acid molecules reflect the composition of the original sample material both qualitatively (with regard to the comprised species) and quantitatively (with regard to the abundances of the detected species). In addition to qualitative and quantitative analyses, the sequences allow functional classification, i.e. classification with regard to the functions predicted for any detected sequence. The aforementioned possibilities make metagenomics a powerful tool both scientifically and diagnostically. Diverse scientific applications of metagenomics are reviewed in [3,4]. Scientifically, as mentioned before, the analysis of the microbial community with regard to its taxonomic composition and metabolic capabilities is of interest. Diagnostic metagenomics may be applied if a causative agent of a disease is suspected but cannot be detected by targeted diagnostics. In this case, the agent may be identified based on sequence similarities of even only a single read to known sequences with a relation to database-listed pathogen genomes. Hence, diagnostic metagenomics primarily aims at the taxonomic classification of the sequences. For instance, Palacios and co-workers [5] identified a novel virus with similarity to an old world arenavirus as the causative agent in a study of three patients who died of a febrile illness 4 to 6 weeks after receiving organ transplantations from the same donor. Another prime example for the diagnostic application of metagenomics was the detection of Schmallenberg virus (SBV). Here, the detection of only 7 reads with similarity to orthobunyavirus sequences within a dataset of roughly 27,500 reads provided the necessary information for diagnosis, virus isolation, and finally experimental proof of SBV as the causative agent of disease [6].",

Meanwhile, complete workflows exist to analyse metagenomic sequence data, for example MG-RAST [7] and the EBI metagenomics service [8] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/). Moreover, comprehensive lists of tools for the different analysis parts are available [3,9-11]. The workflows apply different strategies for initial data preparation to ensure efficient analyses. These strategies include initial clustering [12], mapping along reference sequences [13,14], or assembling reads into contigs (sets of overlapping reads) [15,16]. After initial data preparation, the sequences are classified taxonomically or functionally, again applying different strategies using various tools.",

            "text": "For taxonomic classification, diverse software applications were designed which all use different algorithms but rely on the analysis of 16S rRNA sequences. Software enabling the comparison of datasets obtained from different habitats is inter alia DOTUR [17]. This tool clusters 16S rRNA sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or phylotypes and analyses genetic distances between sequences. The principle of DOTUR was expanded in the software SONS [18]. The application LIBSHUFF [19] compares samples by statistical comparison of their 16S rRNA sequence contents. The tool UniFrac [20] calculates evolutionary distances of multiple environments based on phylogenetic information and multivariate statistical techniques. All these applications are limited to 16S rRNA sequences, hence only prokaryotic sequences can be analysed. In addition to the different aforementioned types of exclusively taxonomic classifications, the tool Qiime [21] allows the combination of OTU based taxonomic classification with additional analyses. These additional analyses include sequence alignments, inference of phylogenetic trees, and phylogenetic or taxon-based analysis of diversity. Like Qiime, PhyloPythia [22] also enables phylogenetic analyses. It uses a multiclass support vector machine classifier with the oligonucleotide composition of variable-length genome fragments for the generation of phylogenetic sequence clades. For the analysis of read sequences, PhyloPythia is rather inappropriate due to the fact that its accuracy decreases dramatically by using input sequences of length less than 1,000 nucleotides [22] as is the case for reads.",

Analyses at the nucleic acid sequence level are e.g. performed with BLAST, HMMer, or BLAT [23-25]. Glimmer, FragGeneScan, or GeneMark [26-28] perform assessments of open reading frames using probabilistic models in order to rate the coding capacity of the raw sequences. All the aforementioned applications generate only per read results which must subsequently be further processed to extract and summarize the relevant information.

            "text": "A limitation of all taxonomic and functional binning tools is the analysis duration due to the linear correlation between analysis time and data size. To speed up the binning, hardware improvements are possible. Another way is to split the query data into subsets for parallel analysis in a network of multiple servers like it is realised in cloud computing [30] and with the software MetaGeniE [31]. The throughput of similarity based binning can also be increased by using fast heuristic approaches applied for instance in the UCLUST and USEARCH algorithms [32]. However, application of UCLUST and USEARCH is restricted by the memory requirements for the analysis which proportionally increases ten times with the size of the database. The performance problem can be circumvented by using publicly available web services like MG RAST [7] and the EBI metagenomics analysis service [8]. Certainly, their capacity is limited as well, leading to considerably long duration of the analyses. Therefore, it might be more effective to run the analysis using locally installed applications. Moreover, in certain settings, for instance when dealing with confidential diagnostic data, it might be necessary to have a local analysis running. This is for instance possible with the recently released software SURPI [33]. After pre-processing the reads, SURPI first screens the query dataset for human sequences followed in fast mode by classification of the reads as viral or bacterial based on reference datasets for viral and bacterial sequences, respectively. Only in comprehensive mode, SURPI screens the pre-processed reads against the complete NCBI nt database and then assembles the reads class-wise to proceed with proteome analysis based on assembled sequences. Other software for local installation also include Readscan [34] and RINS [35], both of which require prior knowledge in form of user input reference sequences the dataset has to be screened for. In case of RINS, the reads are initially mapped to a user provided custom query dataset thereafter filtered for uniqueness and then screened for human sequences. Finally, the non-human reads are assembled and the resulting contigs are classified using blast. Since reads that do not map to the user provided query are exempted from the analysis, the user will only detect what he is explicitly looking for as defined by the query dataset. Similarly, in the case of Readscan, it is necessary to provide datasets classified as host and pathogen references, respectively. The reads are aligned along these sequences and according to the highest percent identity with a reference sequence the reads are finally binned into the predefined classes. Therefore, also in case of Readscan the user needs prior knowledge to provide suitable pathogen and host reference datasets. The crucial importance of the design of reference datasets for the successful correct classification is stressed by the authors of Clinical PathoScope [36]. Likewise, the authors of Kraken [37] emphasize the importance of a validated dataset to be used as the basis of the database in use. Clinical PathoScope, like Kraken [37] and MetaPhlAn [38], can be run locally on a unix server from the command line and produce a comprehensive result summary.",

            "text": "Taken together, although a plethora of different applications and workflows for the analyses of metagenomics data is available, there are various limitations of these. Most importantly, the analyses take too long, the tools do not cover full taxonomic content (e.g. rely on rRNA and therefore will not detect viruses), are by default centred on human sample analysis, or they do not generate a comprehensive and clear result protocol (e.g. BLAST) for further use. Of course, these limitations are due to the specialized aims of the tools. Nevertheless, the resulting obstacles need to be cleared away. Therefore, here we present RIEMS (Reliable Information Extraction from Metagenomic Sequence datasets), our software workflow for sensitive and reliable analysis of metagenomic datasets. Unlike a number of tools mentioned above, which by default assume human sample origin for host screening, RIEMS by default neither requires prior information concerning the sample origin nor other input for read classification, e.g. to distinguish between host and pathogen. Rather, RIEMS automatically detects the most abundant species and screens the complete dataset for the respective sequences. For this purpose, RIEMS combines several established software applications. Different sequence analyses are cascaded with decreasing stringency of the assignments to allow for the highest possible reliability and sensitivity of the read classifications. While the above mentioned workflows act linearly on the complete input datasets, i.e. screening out host reads followed by a single round of read assignments, RIEMS repetitively runs through detection of abundant species. To this end, RIEMS repeatedly extracts random data subsets which are assembled and classified and subsequently the complete dataset is screened for the detected species. Moreover, for unbiased taxonomic classification based on the most similar sequence, RIEMS does not rely on restricted databases but uses the full content of the INSDC databases. As an additional analysis layer, RIEMS can switch to amino acid sequences for the analyses of reads and contigs remaining taxonomically unclassified after analysis of the nucleic acid sequences. Finally, all assignments are summarised in diverse output files as well as in a clearly structured result protocol, classified taxonomically. An early version of RIEMS proved the power of its approach in 2011 when it was used to detect the orthobunyavirus sequences leading to the discovery of Schmallenberg virus [6].",

Here, additional species were identified (see Additional file 1: Table S1). This is caused by highly homologous sequences found in different bacterial species due to direct relations of the species and/or horizontal gene transfer. Assessment of the accuracy using the Clinical PathoScope dataset resulted in similar figures (Table 3). In this case, we used the pre-screening feature of RIEMS to screen the sample for reads representing human sequences. The specificity of the classifications was 100% except for human sequences (99.1%), the median sensitivity was determined as 97.8% (minimum 15%, maximum 99.7%; Table 3). The minimum sensitivity was reached for Influenza A virus where 83% of the reads were classified as synthetic construct, all representing synthetic Influenza A virus constructs, nevertheless not counted as correctly identified.",

A total of 90,378 of the modified artificial reads were assigned and only 7 reads (<0.008%) remained unassigned. As for the original simulated sequencing dataset, all species originally comprised were identified correctly despite the introduced deviations.

Both analyses were run on the same server with identical conditions using the maximum number of available cores (n = 24). Five different datasets were used for benchmarking; three of these were simulated sequencing datasets comprising 79,592, 90,385, and 10,000,000 reads, respectively, and two genuine sequencing datasets (13,816 reads; 247,833 reads). The simulated datasets were the same that were used for the validation. The results of the comparison are shown in Figure 4. While RIEMS classified 99.9% of the 13,816 genuine reads within only 6 minutes, blastn analysis [23] (NCBI nt database) of the same dataset required approximately 10 hours. Extending the dataset roughly linearly increases the duration of blastn analyses due to the approximately linear correlation between the number of sequences and blastn duration. Therefore, the time necessary for the blastn analyses of the larger datasets was extrapolated. Unlike blastn, an increase of the sequence volume does not necessarily cause an increase of the time necessary to analyse the data using RIEMS. RIEMS analyses of 79,592; 90,385; 247,833; and 10,000,000 reads, respectively, always classified \u226599.9% of the reads and took between one and two hours, except for the Clinical PathoScope simulated sample dataset (with default settings 46 hours; by performing an optional pre-screening for human sequences, the duration could be reduced to approximately 19 hours; Figure 4). In conclusion, using RIEMS, there is no direct correlation between the number of sequences and the analysis time, but the duration mainly depends on the complexity of the dataset.",

            "text": "Comparison of RIEMS and the 2 web-services was hampered by the fact that these do not provide classifications per read but only overall figures. For both MG-RAST and EBI Metagenomics only the simulated read dataset of 90,385 original reads was used. The MG-RAST [7] results were formatted to resemble the RIEMS results as far as possible (assignments were limited to the best hit; annotation source set to \u2018GenBank\u2019 with a maximum e-value cut-off of 10\u22124; minimum percentage identity cut-off 60%; minimum alignment length cut-off 15; result table grouped according to families). MG-RAST classified nearly 100% of the reads with an overall accuracy of approximately 90% at the read to family level. Except the Canidae, all families comprised in the dataset were detected but only a few hundreds instead of thousands of reads were assigned to the Bovidae. However, MG-RAST assigned more reads than actually present in the dataset to bacterial families except the Bacillaceae. In contrast, too few reads were assigned to the virus families Paramyxoviridae and Bunyaviridae by MG-RAST. Furthermore, 4,701 simulated sequencing reads were assigned to 130 families not being part of the original data. For a more detailed comparison of the RIEMS and the MG-RAST results please refer to Additional file 1: Table S2. For the second comparison, the simulated sequencing dataset of 90,385 reads was analysed by the EBI metagenomics service [8]. Comparison of the results of RIEMS and EBI metagenomics is hampered by the different classification strategies and data output structures. Most notably, RIEMS does not perform any functional analysis like EBI metagenomics does. On the contrary, EBI metagenomics taxonomic analyses are performed by QIIME [21] only based on the detected 16S rRNA sequences. Hence, EBI metagenomics did not identify a single viral sequence comprised in the dataset. In order to enable the comparison of the results, 488 16S rRNA sequences comprised in the original dataset of 90,385 reads were selected and analysed using RIEMS. Subsequently, the assignments of reads to OTUs by EBI metagenomics or to taxonomic classes by RIEMS were compared (Table 4). RIEMS classified all reads except one correctly; the only falsely classified read belonging to the bacilli was classified to the betaproteobacteria. EBI metagenomics [8], i.e. QIIME [21], also assigned the majority of the clostridial and betaproteobacterial reads to the correct OTUs (deviation less than 1%). However, for the bacillal sequences, with a deviation of 47% the accuracy of the OTU assignments was rather low. These reads were grouped to the alphaproteobacteria, unknown firmicutes, unknown proteobacteria, or unknown bacteria (Table 4).",

All tools detected all species targeted by the prebuilt validated databases provided by the respective authors. Based on the read to species assignments, all 4 programs had specificities close to 100% for all analysed species they target. However, the results for both simulated datasets revealed substantial differences in the sensitivities of the different software in combination with the provided databases (Figure 5) for the different species comprised in the datasets. These differences are most likely caused by the databases we used since restricted databases generally cause a reduced sensitivity [31]. Additionally, our results imply that a restriction of the analysis to only bacteria or bacteria plus viruses poses a problem because a huge proportion of the reads may be left unclassified and hence no information may be available whether these reads represent host sequences or novel microorganisms leaving a substantial portion of uncertainty. Noteworthy, the sensitivity of Clinical PathoScope substantially decreased when analysing the dataset comprising sequences deviating between 1% and 10% from the original sequences (compare Figures 5A and B). Therefore, in the case of novel sequences with too low similarity with the chosen references these novel sequences will not be classified.",

Using the NCBI nt database (as of 30.09.2014) which does not comprise the respective sequences, RIEMS classified all 2,827 reads correctly (read to species classification) at the nucleotide sequence level.

RIEMS required less than 1.5 hours for the detection of reads and contigs representing the new ABV variant. Here, based on the deduced amino acid sequences the \u2018Further analysis\u2019 unambiguously identified the genome as a viral sequence belonging to the species avian bornavirus within the family bornaviridae although the identity of the newly detected with known ABV genome sequences was too low to be identified by nucleotide sequence analyses. Secondly, data from a study of Sachsenr\u00f6der and co-workers [41] were analysed. The authors of this study identified a pig stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV). RIEMS analysis of this second dataset (approx. 70,000 reads) gained equivalent results with regard to the identified organisms and viruses including the new PigSCV. Also in combination with sample preparation specifically targeting sequencing to viral nucleic acids, data analysis using RIEMS proved to be useful and powerful [42].",

            "text": "While sequencing capacities are steadily increasing and simultaneously the price per base is decreasing, there is a substantial lack in powerful tools for efficient data analysis. Meanwhile, the bottleneck of exploiting the full potential of NGS is determined by data analysis capacities. Especially the analysis of metagenomics datasets is complex and time consuming. Although various tools and strategies were published and are publicly accessible, the available capacities are not sufficient. Moreover, the tool of choice depends on the aim of the study. All existing tools and pipelines have their strengths and shortcomings. A general issue seems to be incorrect classification of reads to species. All software programs tested in this study did classify reads incorrectly. This is an intrinsic problem of sequence classification caused by high degrees of identity between the genomes of different strains and even between different related species. However, the specificity of the read classifications is not the major problem but rather the sensitivity seems to be an issue. The reduced sensitivity in a number of settings for the analysis of unbiased metagenomics sequence data is caused by the fact that they don\u2019t do unbiased data analysis due to restricted reference databases. This causes a substantial loss in sensitivity especially for the classification of sequences with only limited similarity to known sequences. Here, RIEMS has the potential to fill the gap that still exists. All comparisons showed a high sensitivity for RIEMS analyses and at the same time a high specificity. With its only very limited software dependencies RIEMS is suitable for local installation, thereby minimizing the need to transfer huge datasets via the internet and helping to maintain data confidentiality. Moreover, the output of RIEMS is clearly structured taxonomically and the sorted sequence reads can easily be used for successive analyses. This allows the integration of RIEMS analysis into existing workflows, for instance sorting the raw data prior to assembly. Of course, the combination of RIEMS with various other tools for metagenomics analyses is possible, enabling the quick and comprehensive characterization of metagenomics datasets.",

Subsequently, the resulting contigs are analysed using megablast against the NCBI nucleotide database \u201cnt\u201d (all GenBank + EMBL + DDBJ + PDB sequences) [23]. Based on GenBank identifiers (GIs) of the best hits, the associated taxonomy IDs of the corresponding species are determined in the NCBI taxonomy database. This information is used to retrieve all sequences of each detected species from the nucleotide database. Successively, each of these sequence sets is first used as reference for a mapping and thereafter a megablast [23] analysis in which reads excluded from the mapping due to length restriction or partially mapped reads are included (a detailed depiction of the repetitive taxonomy based sequence retrieval and alignment procedure can be found in Additional file 1: Figures S1, S2, and S3). In case an identified organism is a eukaryote, all reads that were classified to this organism by mapping are blasted against a partial database containing only viral sequences in order to identify viral reads potentially classified as eukaryotic reads due to viral sequences which may be part of eukaryotic genomes (Additional file 1: Figure S3). All reads that were classified in one of these steps are exempted from subsequent analyses. This procedure (generating and assembling a random sequence subset, followed by BLAST, sequence retrieval and mapping plus scanning for viral sequences) is repeated with the remaining unassigned reads until either no new species are identified by blasting the generated contigs or no new contigs can be assembled.

The taxonomy IDs of the hits are determined according to their GenBank Identifiers (GIs) obtained from the BLAST result. Only if more than eight reads are assigned to the same taxonomy ID the corresponding sequences are retrieved from the nucleotide database and used as reference for a mapping and a subsequent megablast analysis like in the initial background analysis (Additional file 1: Figures S2 and S3).",

The only limitation we apply is a lower size cut-off of 20 amino acids because shorter peptide sequences cannot be analysed by blastp to yield a truly significant result; hence all ORFs with a minimum length of 20 codons are translated independently of start codons until reaching a stop codon. These settings assure that even in the case of sequencing noise causing non-sense mutations by insertions, deletions or single base exchanges the coded aa sequences can be analysed at least as partial sequences. In the case of short reads, i.e. Illumina HiSeq style reads, the lower size cut-off of 20 aa still permits their analysis. The deduced amino acid sequences are binned according to their length in order to select the proper substitution matrices for blastp according to [43,44] (<35 amino acids PAM-30, 35 \u2013 50 amino acids PAM-70, 50 \u2013 85 amino acids BLOSUM-80 and >85 amino acids BLOSUM-62). For contigs, all deduced aa sequences are analysed by blastp vs. NCBI nr database (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Blastp analyses (vs. NCBI nr database) of aa sequences deduced from reads (Additional file 1: Figure S8) start with the longest sequences translated from the reads, and only proceeds with the next shorter aa sequence deduced from that read if no hit was found in the database. If a similar aa sequence was detected all additional aa sequences for the respective read are exempted from further blast analyses.",

For the comparisons we used different datasets, namely our simulated sample (see Table 1) with and without deviations, a small dataset comprising roughly 2,800 genuine Illumina MiSeq reads representing 2 different novel viruses, and the simulated sample #1 from the Clinical PathoScope project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/PathoScope). Here we had to modify the read accessions of reads representing Streptococcal sequences, because the authors didn\u2019t label the reads according to the two different Streptococcal species present in the dataset. This was done by majority according to the classifications of the 4 tools in use. Roughly 4800 reads had to be discarded because of inconclusive classifications. Like RIEMS, the three tools put out read-wise classifications which were analysed using R (v3.1.0) [45] and R-Studio (v 0.98.507; RStudio, Inc. www.rstudio.com) to calculate the sensitivity and specificity. To enable a robust comparison of the different tools, classifications were consolidated to the species level and only unambiguous read-to-species classifications were taken into account. In case of Clinical PathoScope, reads longer than 100 bases are by default split into fragments; RIEMS has the capability to split reads if only partial matches occur. In both cases, results obtained for the sub-sequences were consolidated at the read level and again only counted if the results were unambiguous.",
