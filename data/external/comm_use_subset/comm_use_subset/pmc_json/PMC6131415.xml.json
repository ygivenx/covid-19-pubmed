            "text": "Griffithsin (GRFT) is a lectin originally isolated from a red algae, Griffithsia sp (Mori et al., 2005). GRFT is one of the most potent HIV\u20101 entry inhibitors yet described, and hence of great interest for use in HIV\u20101 prophylaxis and therapy (Lusvarghi and Bewley, 2016; O'Keefe et al., 2009). We developed an efficient and scalable manufacturing method for recombinant GRFT using a tobamovirus\u2010based gene expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana and have shown that the plant produced GRFT product has a favourable preclinical safety and efficacy profile, supporting its development as a topical microbicide to prevent HIV\u20101 and HSV\u20102 transmission (Kouokam et al., 2011, 2016; Nixon et al., 2013; O'Keefe et al., 2009). Beyond its use for prevention of viral sexually transmitted infection, recent studies showed GRFT has antiviral activity against enveloped viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), SARS coronavirus and Japanese encephalitis virus (Ishag et al., 2013; Meuleman et al., 2011; O'Keefe et al., 2010). Prolonging the serum half\u2010life of biologics is generally desirable for therapeutic use, and protein engineering strategies such as creation of immunoadhesins, serum albumin fusions and pegylation have been used to improve pharmacokinetics (Strohl, 2015). Although we express wild\u2010type GRFT in the cytoplasm of N. benthamiana plants, achieving impressive yields, protein engineering strategies for improving serum half\u2010life will often require directing fusion proteins to the secretory pathway to achieve proper folding and post\u2010translational modifications. We were aware that targeting GRFT to the secretory pathway in N. benthamiana causes severe necrotic symptoms and consequently low yields of protein (Stark, 2013), and therefore decided to investigate the molecular basis of the host response to ectopic expression of lectins in the secretory pathway.",

The GRFT homodimer has six carbohydrate\u2010binding sites, three located at each of the opposite ends of the double\u2010prism homodimer (Moulaei et al., 2010). GRFT binds to high\u2010mannose N\u2010glycans on the HIV viral envelope spike gp120 and inhibits the viral envelope structural transitions which are essential for viral entry, thus preventing HIV infection of T cells (Mori et al., 2005). GRFT also inhibits cell\u2010associated HIV\u20101 infection of dendritic cells (DC) by inhibiting the transfer of the virus from DC\u2010SIGN to uninfected T cells. Replacement of an aspartic acid residue in each of the glycan binding sites abrogates GRFT's ability to bind oligomannose glycosylated proteins and eliminates its viral neutralization activity (Xue et al., 2012). Therefore, the GRFT activity is dependent on its ability to bind multiple mannose N\u2010glycans.",

            "text": "In preliminary studies, we found that targeting GRFT to the secretory pathway induced a strong necrotic phenotype reminiscent of the hypersensitive reaction (HR), a resistance response induced by interaction between a plant resistance gene (R gene) and an avirulence factor of a pathogen (Avr gene). HR is a type of programmed cell death that accompanies defence reactions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including H2O2, the accumulation of plant hormones such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) or ethylene, and the expression of pathogenesis\u2010related (PR) genes (Hammond\u2010Kosack and Jones, 1997; Nurnberger et al., 2004). The HR signals extend to noninfected cells and lead to systemic acquired resistance that is effective against a broad\u2010spectrum of pathogens (Durrant and Dong, 2004). In most HR, SA signalling is involved and SA accumulation shows a strong correlation with generation of ROS (Durrant and Dong, 2004; Lee and Park, 2010). Naphthalene hydroxylase (NahG), which is derived from Pseudomonas syringae, degrades SA and suppresses SA\u2010regulated signalling (Brodersen et al., 2005; Clarke et al., 2004). NahG overexpression inhibits SA\u2010dependent HR induction in various plant species (Brodersen et al., 2005; Mur et al., 1997).",

Our preliminary data showed that GRFT fused with an apoplast localization signal caused severe laminar necrosis, despite low accumulation levels of apoplast\u2010targeted GRFT compared with cytosol\u2010localized GRFT. Here, we analysed the mechanism whereby GRFT induces HR\u2010like cell death in N. benthamiana. We show GRFT\u2010induced HR\u2010like cell death is SA\u2010dependent. Analysis of expression of the GRFT mutant showed six carbohydrate\u2010binding sites per GRFT dimer were required for the induction of HR\u2010like cell death and provided data supporting our hypothesis that a specific interaction between GRFT and an apoplast\u2010located endogenous glycoprotein, XYL1, initiates the HR response. Molecular characterization of the protein interactions and physiological response to targeting GRFT expression to the apoplast helped us identify strategies to dampen the necrosis response and rescue expression of GRFT\u2010 and similar engineered lectin fusions in the plant secretory pathway.",

Accumulation levels of GRFT localized in apoplast (GRFT\u2010Apo) were markedly lower. Targeting GRFT expression to the apoplast caused necrosis in N. benthamiana, which was not observed in the plants expressing GRFT in cytosol (Figure S1d). As another group had shown that overexpression of plant lectin CaMBL1 caused salicylic acid (SA)\u2010dependent HR\u2010like cell death in N. benthamiana (Hwang and Hwang, 2011), we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon could account for the GRFT\u2010induced necrosis. Indeed, the GRFT\u2010Apo\u2010induced necrosis was found to be associated with an increase in H2O2 production as indicated by staining by 2\u20327\u2032\u2010dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining (H2DCFDA, Figure S1b). Furthermore, Evans blue staining showed that cell death occurred in the regions with induced H2O2 production (Figure S1b, Kim et al., 2008). As H2O2 acts an inducer of defence\u2010associated genes such as pathogenesis\u2010related protein (PR) genes, SA\u2010dependent PR1 gene expression levels were analysed. Quantitative real\u2010time PCR showed that PR1 gene expression was increased (Figure S1c). No necrotic symptoms, elevated H2O2 levels or enhanced PR1 gene expression were observed in the control plants (empty vector) or in plants expressing GRFT\u2010Cyt. Similarly, expression of GRFT\u2010Apo by a plant expression binary vector, pTRA (nonreplicating), caused necrosis symptoms, resulting in a lower accumulation level than GRFT\u2010Cyt. These results confirm that the necrotic phenotype is due to apoplast targeting of GRFT and that the tobacco mosaic virus proteins used to amplify RNA levels in the magnICON system are not involved in GRFT\u2010Apo\u2010induced necrosis (Figure S3).",

PR1\u2032s induction indicated the possibility that SA accumulation was involved in GRFT\u2010Apo's induction of HR\u2010like cell death. To test this hypothesis, we used NahG, a protein from Pseudomonas syringae which degrades SA (Brodersen et al., 2005). We cloned NahG into a PVX replicon vector (Figure S2, Giritch et al., 2006). Concomitant analyses of PR1 expression and H2O2 levels demonstrated that control plants (transiently expressing GRFT alone) supported high levels of PR1 gene expression and H2O2 generation (Figure 1a,b). Conversely, plants that were inoculated with PVX\u2010NahG and magnICON\u2010GRFT exhibited low levels of PR1 gene expression and we could not detect H2O2 generation in such plants (Figure 1a,b). Therefore, GRFT\u2010Apo\u2010induced HR\u2010like cell death required SA accumulation, and the inhibition of SA accumulation by NahG suppressed the symptoms.",

To validate this hypothesis, functional GRFT protein levels were measured using an HIV\u20101 gp120\u2010binding enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and total GRFT amounts were assessed by Western blotting (O'Keefe et al., 2009). The ELISA and Western blot analysis showed that both functional and gross GRFT expression levels are substantially increased by NahG expression (Figure 1c,d).

Mutations at the carbohydrate\u2010binding site in GRFT disrupt its ability to bind gp120 and inhibit HIV infection (Moulaei et al., 2010). Based on this feature, we hypothesized that GRFT's high mannose binding activity is involved in induction of necrosis. To determine whether the carbohydrate\u2010binding sites in GRFT are required for the induction of HR\u2010like cell death, we created a mutated GRFT (GRFTlec\u2010), which contains the amino acid substitutions D30N, D70N and D112N in the carbohydrate\u2010binding sites, abolishing lectin activity. GRFT and GRFTlec\u2010 fused to the apoplast localization signal were expressed by agroinfiltration. Expression of wild\u2010type GRFT\u2010Apo caused severe cell death accompanied by H2O2 generation, which was not detected in GRFTlec\u2010\u2010Apo\u2010expressing plants (Figure 2a).

NahG and the mannose\u2010binding lectins were co\u2010inoculated into N. benthamiana. The co\u2010expression of NahG and each mannose binding lectin inhibited cell death and H2O2 generation (Figure 3a).

We screened independent yeast transformants and obtained partial XYL1 (AtXYL1, AT1G68560) fragments as a candidate GRFT\u2010interacting host factor. AtXYL1 (At1g68560) was identified an \u03b1\u2010xylosidase against xyloglucan (XG), which localized in cell wall and apoplast (Sampedro et al., 2010). AtXYL1 is a 915\u2010amino acid protein with eight N\u2010glycosylation sites (Sampedro et al., 2001). In the yeast two\u2010hybrid system, AtXYL1, a natively secreted protein, is fused with a nuclear localized protein, GAL4 activation domain (AD). In general, the fusion of GAL4 AD transport targets protein to the nucleus, not through the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory pathway, so the N\u2010glycosylation that would occur in the endoplasmic reticulum might be disrupted. However, there are N\u2010linked glycoproteins present in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Hart and West, 2009), with evidence that certain glycoproteins return to the cytoplasm after entry into the ER or after secretion. (Chandra et al., 1998; Kung et al., 2009; Pedemonte et al., 1990; Reeves et al., 1981). Nonconventional soluble glycosyltransferases may exist in the cytoplasm or nucleus and directly modify the proteins in these compartments. Another possibility is that soluble N\u2010glycosylated proteins may be flipped across membranes or originated from secretory pathways (Varki et al., 2009). While we cannot rule out that the GRFT\u2010AtXYL1 interaction we discovered via the yeast two\u2010hybrid screen is the result of a direct protein\u2010protein interaction, direct evidence of glycan\u2010mediated interaction between the nicotiana homologue of AtXL1 and GRFT through the PLA assay lends support to the hypothesis that the interaction is indeed glycan\u2010mediated.",

The N. benthamiana plants where AtXYL1 was overexpressed showed delayed necrosis symptom development accompanied with H2O2 when secreted GRFT was co\u2010expressed (Figure 5a). In addition, overexpression of AtXYL1 strongly enhanced GRFT\u2010Apo accumulation, similar to what was observed in plants where NahG was co\u2010expressed with apoplast\u2010targeted GRFT (Figure 5b). The fact that AtXYL1 is a regulated factor for secreted GRFT\u2010induced necrosis is supported by XYL1 knock\u2010down experiments. XYL1 targeted pTRV\u2010based virus\u2010induced gene silencing (VIGS) accelerated the GRFT\u2010induced necrosis symptoms (Figure S9). We then identified the NbXYL1 sequence and created a specific antibody based on this NbXYL1 sequence. Interestingly, the plants in which only GRFT\u2010Apo was expressed showed reduction in NbXYL1 protein levels, and the reduction was rescued by AtXYL1 overexpression. AtXYL1 overexpression without co\u2010expression of GRFT did not affect NbXYL1 accumulated levels. This result strongly suggests that the physical interaction between GRFT\u2010Apo and NbXYL1 caused the XYL1 protein concentration reduction. We suggest that the presence of AtXYL1 sequesters GRFT\u2010Apo in a dominant\u2010negative fashion and thereby protects cell wall resident endogenous NbXYL1 from GRFT\u2010Apo\u2010mediated interaction, turnover and ultimately cell death.",

Other mannose binding lectins, SP\u2010D and hMBL also interacted with NbXYL1, but CV\u2010N did not. Xyloglucan (XyG) is a ubiquitous plant polysaccharide, a component of hemicellulose in most dicot species, which cross\u2010links cellulose microfibrils in the wall and builds a cellulose\u2010XyG network in the cell wall (Somerville et al., 2004). XyG structure in cell walls is dynamic; it undergoes structural maturation and degradative turnover by apoplastic plant enzymes (Frankova and Fry, 2013). Plant endoglucanases including endo\u2010\u03b2\u20101,4\u2010glucanases reduce the XyG polymer chain length and degrade XyG into oligosaccharides (XGO, Shigeyama et al., 2016). Apoplast localized enzymes including XYL1, a galactosidase (BGAL10), and a fucosidase (AXY8) are involved in XGO degradation into its various monosaccharides (Gunl and Pauly, 2011; Gunl et al., 2011; Sampedro et al., 2001, 2010, 2012). Recently, it was reported that agrobacterium\u2010mediated overexpression of the pepper xyloglucan\u2010specific endo\u2010\u03b2\u20101,4\u2010glucanases inhibitor protein (CaXEGIP1) induced cell death in N. benthamiana (Choi et al., 2013). The HR\u2010like cell death was accompanied with salicylic acid\u2010dependent PR gene expression indicating XyG metabolism might be involved in the induction of the process (Choi et al., 2013). Our results showed XYL1 is a negative regulator of secreted GRFT\u2010induced HR\u2010like cell death (Figure 6). It is possible that AtXYL1 protects NbXYL1 by simply sequestering apoplast\u2010targeted GRFT. It is also possible that GRFT\u2010NbXYL1 complexes induce HR, while GRFT\u2010AtXYL1 complexes do not. Interestingly, secreted GRFT accumulation reduced levels NbXYL1, and we also saw this phenomenon in plants overexpressing secreted SP\u2010D and hMBL. We demonstrated that NbXYL1 interacts with SP\u2010D and hMBL in the apoplast of N. benthamiana, and overexpression of AtXYL1 reversed HR\u2010like cell death induced by secreted SP\u2010D and hMBL. Furthermore, a XYL1 knock\u2010down in N. benthamiana or Arabidopsis xyl1 knockout mutant under normal growing condition do not show cell death (Sampedro et al., 2010). We speculate that secreted lectins may impact other apoplast localized XGO degradation enzymes in addition to XYL1 and inhibit XyG metabolism, leading to HR\u2010like cell death as shown in CaXEGIP1 overexpression (Figure 6).",
