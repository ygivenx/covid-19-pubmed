The data of surveillance also indicated that the HPIV-positive rates were significantly higher during June to August than those in other months (\u03c72 = 18\u00b779, P < 0\u00b7001). The seasonal trend showed an increase month by month from May to the peak by July and then kept going down rest of months. Interestingly, there was a small peak during October and December in almost every year. Although HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 showed the same seasonal trend mentioned above, HPIV-3 was shown a longer spread than HPIV-1. High peaks of HPIV-2 were seen in April/May/June/July/October/November, and the HPIV-4-positive rates were higher during July to November (Figure1). HPIVs attack population of all ages. The highest rates of age-specific infection, however, were observed in children under 5-year-old group (67/753, 7\u00b775%) and followed by the patients over 60-year-old group (37/678, 5\u00b749%).

HPIV-3 (88/217, 40\u00b755%) and HPIV-1 (569/217, 25\u00b781%) led to the most prevalent HPIVs infection in Beijing. In accordance with our results, a study performed in Yamagata, Japan, between 2002 and 2011 also showed that HPIV-3 was the main HPIV causative agent of ARIs in children.6 But because wider age-group patients were considered, our results showed that infants, young children, and elderly were the risk populations of HPIVs infection, especially HPIV-3 infection. The higher infections by HPIVs in summer in Beijing and the biennial trend for HPIV-2 were consistent with other reports.2,6 The circulating types and related intensity varied in different year, and the type-specific seasonal patterns were not well understood. Whether the higher detection rate in 2011 and 2014 was from the naturally rising HPIVs infection in population or from the different epidemiological trend for different types of HPIVs, more surveillance data would be needed. Our study also showed that the HPIVs were the secondly main respiratory pathogens for ARIs patients, so clarifying the epidemiology of the HPIVs is important for understanding and providing information to evaluate the respiratory disease burden in clinics and disease control policies.",
