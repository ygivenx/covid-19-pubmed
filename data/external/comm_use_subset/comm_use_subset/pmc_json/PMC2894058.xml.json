            "text": "Virus internalisation is initiated by binding to specific receptors at the cell-surface and culminates in host-cell membrane penetration and delivery of the viral genome to the site of replication. For many viruses, membrane penetration follows virus endocytosis. Several different endocytosis pathways operate in mammalian cells which deliver cargoes to distinct intracellular locations [1], [2]. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major pathway for receptor-dependent endocytosis in many cell types and is dependent on adaptor proteins, such as the AP-2 complex, the GTPase dynamin [2], [3], and several other important accessory molecules including AP180 and Eps-15 [4], [5], [6]. CME delivers cargoes to acidic endosomes; initially to early-endosomes where they are sorted for transport to either late-endosomes/lysosomes for degradation or to recycling-endosomes for recycling back to the cell surface. Several acid-activated viruses are known to exploit the low pH within vesicles derived from the clathrin pathway, to trigger capsid un-coating and/or membrane penetration [7].",

Cargoes internalised by caveolae are delivered to neutral pH caveosomes [8], [9]. From caveosomes, cargoes can traffic to the ER or Golgi [10], [11], [12]. Like CME, caveolae-mediated uptake requires dynamin and can be inhibited by expression of dominant-negative (DN) mutants of dynamin-2 [10], [12]. A number of viruses use caveolae for infection [10], [13], [14], [15], [16] and much of our knowledge of caveolae comes from studies with simian virus-40 [10], [17], [18]. A number of caveolin-independent pathways also originate from lipid-rafts, and novel clathrin- and raft-independent processes have also been identified. These pathways have different requirements for cellular proteins such as dynamin, flotillin, small GTPases, and for cholesterol and other specific lipids [1], [2], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], and can also be exploited by viruses for infection [21], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31].",

Macropinocytosis is constitutive in many cell types but in others requires activation by growth factors [32], [33], [34] and contributes significantly to antigen presentation by specialised antigen presenting cells [32], [34], [35]. Macropinocytosis is also exploited by a wide range of important animal pathogens for cell invasion and possibly the avoidance of immune surveillance [36].",

The outer capsid is formed from two viral proteins, VP2 and VP5, while the inner core-particle consists of a \u2018core-surface\u2019 layer composed of VP7, which surrounds a sub-core shell composed of VP3. VP2 interacts with host cell-surface receptors serving as a virus-attachment protein while VP5 is involved in host-cell membrane penetration [41], [42], [43]. The outer capsid proteins are removed during cell entry, and transcriptionally active core particles are released into the cytosol where virus replication occurs [44], [45]. However, the core-particle is also infectious in its own right demonstrating that VP7 can also mediate cell attachment and membrane penetration, possibly by a distinct mechanism [46]. Other viral encoded proteins (NS1, NS2 and NS3) are also produced in infected cells where they are involved in virus replication and release of progeny virus particles [47].",

Recent studies have concluded that entry and infection of Vero and Hela cells by BTV-10 occurs via CME, with capsid disassembly and membrane penetration within early-endosomes [45]. Here we describe the use of pharmacological and DN inhibitors of endocytosis to investigate entry and infection of BHK cells by BTV-1. We found that the clathrin pathway is not the major entry route used by BTV-1 to infect BHK cells. Instead we found that the entry mechanism shares certain characteristics in common with macropinocytosis and appears to deliver virus directly to late endosomal compartments. These studies extend earlier observations and show that BTV joins an increasing number of viruses that can exploit multiple endocytosis pathways for infectious entry.",

Here we have investigated the involvement of the clathrin pathway in BTV-1 entry and infection of BHK cells using deletion mutants of AP180 (AP180C) and Eps15 (Eps15-Ed95/295; from here known as DN-Esp15) which act as DN inhibitors of CME and block uptake of transferrin [5], [6], [51]. BHK cells were transiently transfected to express AP180C-c-myc, GFP-DN-Eps15, or a control GFP-Eps15 (D3\u03942; from here known as \u2018Esp15 control\u2019) that does not interfere with the clathrin pathway [5], [51]. At 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with Alexa-568 labelled transferrin for 15 minutes or with BTV-1 for 0.5 h. The cells were then fixed and processed for confocal microscopy (Fig. 1). Virus was detected using PM10 (anti-VP5) and an Alexa-568 conjugated secondary antibody. Cells expressing Eps15 proteins or AP180C were identified by the GFP or c-myc fusion tags respectively (see methods) and are shown in green on figure 1. Cells were scored for transferrin or BTV uptake as described in the methods. For each DN protein, uptake of transferrin or BTV was normalised to the results obtained for the controls (see methods). In cells expressing GFP-DN-Eps15 the frequency of transferrin uptake was reduced by 53% when compared to cells expressing the Eps15 control (Fig. 1A, B, E, F and O) indicating a block to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Similarly, the frequency of transferrin uptake was reduced by 82% in cells expressing AP180C when compared to cells of the non-expressing population (Fig. 1I, J and O). In contrast, expression of DN-Eps15 (Fig. 1C, D, G, H and O) or AP180C (Fig. 1K, L and O) did not significantly inhibit virus uptake. In virtually all cells expressing the DN proteins the pattern of virus labelling was indistinguishable from cells expressing the Esp15 control or cells that were not expressing a transgene. These results show that under conditions where clathrin-mediated uptake of transferrin is inhibited BTV-1 is taken up normally by BHK cells.",

This raises the possibility that the virus may have been forced to enter the cells via an endocytic pathway that is not normally used, or is non-productive for infection. Therefore we also investigated the effect of AP180C expression on BTV-1 infection at a low m.o.i., to encourage virus uptake by the most efficient route. At 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with BTV-1 (m.o.i. = 1) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then washed to remove excess virus and infection continued for a further 11 h when the cells were fixed and processed for confocal microscopy. Cells expressing AP180C were identified using expression of the c-myc tag as described above. Infected cells were identified using a rabbit antibody (Orab1) that binds the viral NS2 protein (a marker of virus replication) and an Alexa-568 conjugated secondary antibody. Intense areas of NS2 labelling were detected within infected cells (Fig. 1M and N). Cells expressing AP180C were scored for infection (indicated by labelling for NS2) and the results normalised to the results obtained for the non-expressing cell population. In the cells expressing AP180C the frequency of infection was similar to that of the non-expressing cell population, indicating that AP180C does not inhibit infection (Fig. 1O). These results show that virus uptake by cells expressing AP180C leads to infection and support the conclusion that CME is not the major pathway used by BTV-1 for entry into BHK cells.",

Pre-treatment of BHK cells with concanamycin-A inhibited BTV-1 infection (Fig. 2A and 2B) confirming the requirement for active endosomal acidification. Similarly, when concanamycin-A was added coincident with the start of infection (i.e. at time 0 on figure 2C) a strong inhibitory effect was also seen. When added after the start of infection, concanamycin-A also had an inhibitory effect on infection. When added 2 h after infection was initiated, the frequency of infection was reduced by \u223c50% when compared to mock treated cells (Fig. 2C). Near identical results were obtained using ammonium chloride in place of concanamycin-A (data not shown).

The effect of cholesterol depletion on BTV-1 infection was investigated using methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) which binds and extracts cholesterol from the plasma membrane. BHK cells were mock-treated or treated with M\u03b2CD for 0.5 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then incubated with filipin which binds cholesterol and can be detected by fluorescence microscopy. Filipin fluorescence was detected at the plasma membrane and within the cytosol of mock-treated cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, although fluorescence was detected within the cytosol, the intense plasma membrane fluorescence generated by filipin binding was greatly reduced by M\u03b2CD, indicating extensive and selective cholesterol depletion from the cell surfaces (Fig. 3B).",

Cells expressing wt or DN-dynamin-2 were identified by the GFP fusion tag and are shown in green. The cells expressing GFP-DN-dynamin-2 showed transferrin uptake at a lower frequency than cells expressing the wt construct (Fig. 4A-D and 4I) indicating a block to clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

After the 1 h incubation with virus the cells were washed to remove excess unbound virus and inhibitor, and infection continued for a further 11 h. At the end of infection the cells were processed for confocal microscopy using NS2 to detect infected cells. The effects of cytochalasin-D on actin filaments are reversible and it is possible that following drug wash-out, virus that remained bound to the outsides of the cells (as a result of actin disruption) may cause an infection. Therefore ammonium chloride was added to the culture medium immediately after the virus inoculums and cytochalasin-D was removed. Ammonium chloride is a membrane permeable weak base that rapidly raises endosomal pH [57] and was added to prevent further infection events by virus that have not yet entered the cell and undergone acid-induced membrane penetration. Under these conditions infection can only occur during the period when cytochalasin-D was present. To control for possible effects on intracellular virus replication, cytochalasin-D was also added to other cells immediately after the virus inoculums were removed and co-incident with the addition of ammonium chloride. Under these conditions, cytochalasin-D can only have an inhibitory effect on infection by interfering with post-entry virus replication. Figure 6E shows that pre-treatment of BHK cells with cytochalasin-D inhibited BTV-1 infection. In contrast, when added after the virus internalisation step no inhibitory effect was seen (Fig. 6E). Similar results were obtained using latrunculin-A in place of cytochalasin-D (Fig. 6E). These results confirm that BTV-1 infectious entry into BHK cells is actin dependent.",

EIPA has previously been shown to inhibit macropinocytosis without affecting other endocytic pathways such as CME [58].

Consistent with these observations, Forzan et al\n[45] concluded that BTV-10 infection of Vero and Hela cells is mediated by CME, with capsid disassembly and membrane penetration occurring from within early-endosomes. In this report, we have confirmed that active endosomal acidification is required for BTV-1 infection of BHK cells. However, in contrast to previous studies we found that the clathrin pathway is not the major entry route used by BTV-1 to infect BHK cells. This conclusion is based on a number of observations, including; (1) although a low endosomal pH was shown to be essential for infection, the kinetics of BTV-1 delivery to acidic compartments was slower than expected for uptake by the clathrin pathway [53]; (2) during entry, BTV-1 did not co-localise with transferrin, a commonly used marker for CME; and (3) cell-entry and infection was not inhibited by expression of three different DN inhibitors of CME (AP180C, DN-Eps15 and DN-dynamin-2). Furthermore, both EIPA and cytochalasin-D were shown to inhibit uptake of BTV-1 but not uptake of transferrin indicating that BTV-1 and transferrin are internalised by different endocytic pathways.",

            "text": "Our observations suggest that during entry into BHK cells, BTV-1 is delivered to acidic compartments via a clathrin independent route. One possible route is uptake via caveolae as they can undergo fusion with early-endosomes [17]. However, the failure of DN-dynamin to inhibit BTV-1 entry and infection of BHK cells suggests that virus uptake is independent of caveolae. This conclusion was further supported by showing that BTV-1 infection was not inhibited by cholesterol depletion, which disrupts several lipid-raft dependent processes including caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Another clathrin-independent uptake route that leads to acidic endosomes is the CLIC/GEEC (CLathrin Independent Carriers/GPI-AP Enriched Endocytic Compartments) pathway [61], [62]. However, in contrast to the entry mechanism used by BTV-1 to infect BHK cells, the CLIC/GEEC pathway is highly sensitive to cholesterol depletion [62] and is, therefore, unlikely to mediate BTV-1 uptake. Recent studies have shown that vesicles derived from a number of other clathrin-independent pathways can fuse with early- or late-endosomes [22], [24], [63], [64], and that viruses can use such mechanisms for infectious entry [15], [16], [24]. For example, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) and Kaposi's Sarcoma associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) are internalised by clathrin-independent mechanisms that result in virus delivery to late-endosomes without first passing through early-endosomes [65], [66], [67]. However, the uptake pathway used by LCMV appears distinct from that described here for BTV-1 entry into BHK cells in several ways including that LCMV uptake and infection are not blocked by inhibitors of macropinocytosis. The entry route used by KSHV appears more similar to that described here for BTV-1 since it also shares characteristics of macropinocytosis; however, unlike the BTV-1 BHK cell entry mechanism, entry of KSHV is not inhibited by dynasore and is therefore dynamin independent.",

A number of viruses including vaccinia virus [68], [69], [70], coxsackievirus B3 [71], HIV [72], KSHV [66], echovirus 11 [73], [74], human rhinovirus-14 [75] and Adenovirus type 3 [76] have been shown to exploit macropinocytosis, or macropinocytosis-like endocytic pathways for cell-entry and infection. Macropinosomes can deliver their contents to late endosomal compartments (late-endosomes or lysosomes) without the need for early-endosomes [32], [59]. Similarly, the route described here for BTV-1 entry into BHK cells also appears to by-pass early-endosomes and delivers virus to late endosomal compartments. These observations suggest that infection (i.e. acid induced membrane penetration) might occur from within late-endosomes or lysosomes. However, we cannot yet be certain that these compartments are the site of infection as the intermediate steps of virus trafficking between the plasma membrane and late-endosomal compartments are not known, and it is possible that virus could be exposed to a low pH on transit.",

Similarly, viruses that use macropinocytosis for infection display different sensitivities to dynamin inhibition [69], [70]. Our studies showed that a DN mutant of the \u2018aa\u2019 splice variant of dynamin-2 does not inhibit BTV-1 uptake or infection of BHK cells. This DN mutant was shown to inhibit uptake of transferrin (see Fig. 4) but not dextran (data not shown), indicating that macropinocytosis/fluid-phase uptake, but not CME is active in BHK cells expressing this mutant. These observations are consistent with recent studies by Cao et al., (2007) which show that different splice variants of dynamin-2 regulate different endocytosis pathways, and that expression of a DN mutant of the \u2018aa\u2019 splice variant of dynamin-2 resulted in attenuation of transferrin, but not dextran uptake [55]. In contrast, BTV-1 uptake was inhibited by the dynamin inhibitor, dynasore. Since it is likely that dynasore inhibits all forms of dynamin, this observation suggests that the mechanism used by BTV-1 to enter BHK cells is dynamin dependent but relies on a form of dynamin that cannot be inhibited by DN mutants of the \u2018aa\u2019 splice variant of dynamin-2.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have described here a pathway for BTV-1 uptake and infection of BHK cells that is independent of clathrin and cholesterol requires dynamin, appears to deliver virus directly to late-endosomes/lysosomes without first passing through early-endosomes, and shares characteristics with macropinocytosis. Recently, Forzan et al., [45] reported that BTV-10 infection of Vero and Hela cells is mediated by CME with acid-induced infection occurring within early-endosomes. Hence, BTV joins an increasing number of viruses that appears able to use more than one endocytic pathway to initiate infection [21], [66], [79], [80], [81], [82]. BTV infects a wide variety of cell types in its mammalian hosts including endothelial cells [37], mononuclear phagocytes [83], \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [84], dendritic cells [85], and a variety of leukocytes [37], [86]. It is likely that this broad tropism, and the ability of BTV to replicate in such evolutionary distant hosts results, in part from an ability to use multiple entry routes to initiate infection. Moreover, BTV can exist in at least three different forms that are all considered to be infectious. These include intact virus particles, infectious sub-viral particles, and virus-cores [46]. These different particle types have different surface components, and may therefore also use different entry mechanisms for infection. However, the entry route used by BTV to infect its natural target cells and the relevance of these pathways to pathogenesis in the animal and insect hosts will require further study.",
