            "text": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in humans, affecting 400 million people worldwide [1]. G6PD plays an essential role in the pentose phosphate shunt for reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to NADPH. NADPH primarily serves to reduce equivalents for numerous biochemical reactions such as reductive biosynthesis, glutathione reduction, detoxification, and NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide production. Therefore, G6PD helps to maintain cellular redox homeostasis [2,3], whereas G6PD deficiency predisposes cells to increased oxidative stress. G6PD-knockdown cells exhibit premature senescence, growth retardation, and increased susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis [4,5,6]. Clinically, in addition to the classical association with hemolytic anemia [7,8], patients with G6PD-deficiency have an increased risk of degenerative diseases [9,10,11,12]. G6PD-deficient cells are more susceptible to enterovirus, coronavirus, and dengue virus infections [13,14,15]. These findings suggest that the G6PD status, and hence the redox environment, is a risk factor for viral infection. The mechanism underlying the effect of the redox environment on viral replication remains elusive.",

            "text": "Viral replication and spread is inhibited by the antiviral defense mechanisms of the host. The replication and spread normally involves activation of the antiviral innate immune responses and culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) [16] and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) [17,18]. Both IFNs and TNF-\u03b1 are antiviral cytokines and display strong antiviral activity in host innate immunity [19]. Type I IFNs are the principal antiviral cytokines produced during the innate immune responses to viral infections, and upregulate antiviral proteins [20,21,22]. More than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are initiated by type I IFN signaling, have been discovered. Some ISG-encoded proteins, such as GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) [23], protein kinase R (PKR) [24], and 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [25], are implicated in the antiviral state. Several ISGs are upregulated by infection with coronavirus or enterovirus [26,27,28]. TNF-\u03b1 inhibited viral infections [19], and endogenous TNF-\u03b1 inhibited the enhanced susceptibility to infectious diseases [29].",

Moreover, HSCARG suppresses the TNF-\u03b1-stimulated activation of NF-\u03baB [40], suggesting that the NADPH/NADP+ ratio or the redox status affects the NF-\u03baB-mediated immune response through the modulation of HSCARG. HSCARG can inhibit TRAF3 ubiquitination and negatively regulate the cellular antiviral response [42]. Because of the crucial role of G6PD in maintaining cellular NADPH/NADP+, examining the relationship among the G6PD status, HSCARG, and host innate immune response is worthwhile.",

The expression of viral genes is substantially higher in G6PD-knockdown cells infected with human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) and EV71 than in infected control cells. The expression of antiviral genes, such as MX1 and TNF-\u03b1, is upregulated, albeit to lower levels, in G6PD deficient cells. HSCARG, whose expression is enhanced in G6PD-deficient cells, inhibits I\u03baB degradation and the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB. Exogenous G6PD or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which increases cellular NADPH/NADP+, restores NF-\u03baB-mediated antiviral response. These findings demonstrate that G6PD activity, and hence NADPH/NADP+ status, can affect antiviral immunity through the modulation of HSCARG and the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade.",

The expression of the antiviral genes TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 was studied in the infected A549-Gi and A549-Sc cells. TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels increased more than 400-fold in the A549-Sc cells at 2 h p.i., and returned to the original levels at 8 h p.i. (Figure 1C). The induction level was considerably lower in the A549-Gi cells, with the mRNA levels showing only a 250-fold increase at 2 h p.i. (Figure 1C, white bars). Likewise, the expression of the MX1 gene increased during the infection course of HCoV-229E, and was significantly higher in the A549-Sc cells than in the A549-Gi cells (Figure 1D). The level of MX1 mRNA increased over 22.8-fold at 2 h p.i. and 774.2-fold at 8 h p.i in the A549-Sc cells (Figure 1D).

The difference in inducibility of antiviral genes in control versus G6PD-deficient cells was observed in the case of EV71 infection, which increased TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 expression in RD cells (Table S2 and Figure S1). The expression of TNF-\u03b1 (Figure S1B) and MX1 (Figure S1C) genes in G6PD-knockdown RD-Gi cells was significantly lower than in RD-Sc cells. Furthermore, G6PD-knockdown increased the susceptibility to EV71 infection (Figure S1A, right panel; G6PD protein expression was shown in the left panel).

Pretreatment of the A549 cells with siRNA against TNF-\u03b1 significantly reduced HCoV-229E-induced TNF-\u03b1 expression throughout the course of infection (Figure 2A). Moreover, there was an increase in viral gene expression (Figure 2B). Conversely, TNF-\u03b1 pretreatment significantly inhibited viral replication in a dose dependent manner (Figure 2C).

The construct MX1P had the wild-type MX1 gene promoter, while the constructs MX1D and MX1M had no binding sites or had mutant NF-\u03baB binding sites (Figure 4A).

The HSCARG-specific and nontargeting-siRNA-treated cells were infected with HCoV-229E (at a MOI of 0.1), and assayed for NF-\u03baB binding activity. The NF-\u03baB binding activity was enhanced in the HSCARG-specific, siRNA-treated cells.

The effect of the siRNA treatment on the temporal change of the expression of the TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 genes were studied in the infected cells. The levels of the transcripts of these genes were elevated in the HSCARG-specific, siRNA-treated cells compared with the nontargeting siRNA-treated cells during the course of HCoV-229E infection (Figure 6C,D). The elevation in the expression of the antiviral genes was accompanied by a converse reduction in the expression of the viral N gene (Figure 6E). The overexpression of HSCARG in the A549 cells decreased NF-\u03baB binding activity. Therefore, antiviral gene expression increased coronaviral replication (Figure S3).

We have previously shown that G6PD-knockdown cells are more susceptible to viral infection [13,14]. It is probable that the increased susceptibility to viral infections may be partly due to the impaired immune response of G6PD-knockdown cells. The expression of cytokine genes (such as IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) and antiviral genes (such as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)) increases in A549 and MRC-5 cells upon HCoV-229E infection, and increases in RD cells upon EV71 infection. The expression of the TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 genes are differentially regulated in both the normal and G6PD-deficient cells, revealing the modulatory effect of cellular redox status on the innate immune system. Consistent with previous studies reporting that TNF-\u03b1 exerts an antiviral effect [17,19,53], the present study demonstrates that TNF-\u03b1 protects epithelial cells from HCoV-229E infection. Knockdown of TNF-\u03b1 expression can enhance HCoV-229E replication, whereas TNF-\u03b1 pretreatment can decrease the susceptibility of infection in G6PD-knockdown A549 cells. Moreover, the kinetics of MX1 gene induction is of particular interest. The MX1 gene is induced in cells upon infection with HCoV-229E or EV71 at a time point when the type I IFN level is low. These findings suggest that the induction of the MX1 gene may occur via a type I IFN-independent pathway.",

The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway represents an essential regulator of antiviral defense. NF-\u03baB is a key transcription factor involved in the regulation of the immune response [54,55,56]. It is not unprecedented that viral infection is associated with NF-\u03baB signaling, which may benefit the host or the invading microbe [57]. Infection of cells with HCoV-229E results in I\u03baB degradation and increases NF-\u03baB binding. This is accompanied by increased transcription of TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 genes, of which the promoters are endowed with NF-\u03baB binding sites. The necessity of NF-\u03baB in the activation of the antiviral response against HCoV-229E is demonstrated by the ability of BAY11-7085 to inhibit the TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 gene induction in infected cells.",

            "text": "NF-\u03baB activation is sensitive to cellular redox changes; NF-\u03baB is normally activated under oxidative stress [58]. Paradoxically, NF-\u03baB activation is diminished in coronavirus-infected G6PD-deficient cells, suggesting the involvement of additional factors in the antiviral signaling pathway. HSCARG may act as a redox sensor, which functionally alters and undergoes differential translocation in response to different cellular NADPH levels [59]. HSCARG translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under low NADPH conditions [38,39]. HSCARG has been implicated in the fine-tuning of NF-\u03baB activation. Several studies have suggested that HSCARG is involved in the regulation of antiviral signaling. The HSCARG level increases in G6PD-knockdown cells. Treatment with HSCARG siRNA increases the antiviral response and reduces the viral replication in G6PD-knockdown cells. It is likely that G6PD deficiency impairs the cellular capacity to produce NADPH, thus enhancing HSCARG expression and its nuclear translocation. In addition, the exogenous expression of IDH1 is inhibitory to HSCARG expression. Therefore, it is conceivable that HSCARG suppresses NF-\u03baB activity via modulation of I\u03baB phosphorylation/degradation, leading to reduction in the expression of antiviral genes such as TNF-\u03b1 and MX1. This reasoning may account in part for the increased susceptibility of cells to coronavirus or enterovirus. Our findings suggest that the redox status may regulate the antiviral response and viral replication via the HSCARG-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

Drug-induced cytotoxicity in G6PD-deficient cells is normally attributed to their reduced ability to regenerate NADPH and glutathione [4,44,65]. Deficit of NADPH can also lead to reduced NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide generation [66]. Increased superoxide generation by NADPH oxidases in diabetic mice is associated with increased G6PD activity [67]. The correlation between superoxide generation and G6PD activity has been observed in such pathophysiological situations as liver hypertrophy [68], and cardiovascular dysfunction [69]. Likewise, nitric oxide production can be affected [70]. However, the interplay between antioxidative (i.e., NADPH production and maintenance of endogenous antioxidants) and pro-oxidative (i.e., NADPH and superoxide production) roles of G6PD may be more complicated than previously thought. For instance, G6PD-deficient granulocytes have an impaired ability to generate superoxide, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide [71]. On the other hand, G6PD-deficient neutrophils show increased superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production [72]. More studies are needed to solve such a riddle.",
