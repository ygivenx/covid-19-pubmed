Despite being predominantly asymptomatic, neonatal RV infection has received considerable attention, because some studies have reported that natural infection in the neonatal period has been shown to confer protection against subsequent severe diseases [2]. Although it is known that jaundice occurs in premature infants due to RV infection, studies on whether RV infection causes jaundice in neonates are lacking [3, 4].",

Many conditions may clinically present as prolonged neonatal jaundice, including neonatal hepatitis and extrahepatic biliary atresia. These conditions have numerous infectious, metabolic, and genetic causes [6]. Multiple studies have described patients with proven bacterial infections who developed jaundice during the course of their illness [7, 8]. In previous studies, urinary tract infection was observed in 12.5% of asymptomatic jaundiced neonates, with the onset of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the first week of life [9]. Although studies on jaundice due to bacterial infections have progressed, there are limited studies on jaundice caused by viral infections. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between asymptomatic RV infection and jaundice in neonates.",

Only patients aged 3\u201328 days at the time of admission were included in the study, to exclude patients within the incubation period of rotavirus and early jaundice due to blood type incompatibility. Patients were excluded from the study if they died within 3 days of admission or if there were no test results or records after admission. Finally, 596 patients were included in the analysis. During the study period, all admitted patients underwent RV screening tests and were screened daily for gastrointestinal symptoms. The demographic features that were evaluated included gestational age (GA), birth weight, small for gestational age, sex, age at admission, hospital day, mode of delivery, Apgar score (1 min/5 min), perinatal problems, and breastfeeding. Jaundice was diagnosed according to total bilirubin level and GA, in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria [10]. Diarrhea was defined as the passage of unusually loose or watery stools, at least three times in a 24-h period (\u22653 times/day or \u2265 2-fold increase in the number of stools per 8 h) [11]. Diarrhea was ascertained by the nurse at the time of admission, and by the nurse and doctor if the symptoms occurred after admission. Frequent passing of formed stools was not considered diarrhea. Babies fed only breast milk often pass loose, \u201cpasty\u201d stools; this was also not considered diarrhea. Vomiting was defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents occurring at least once in a 24-h period and without a respiratory or structural gastrointestinal tract cause [12]. Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of \u226538 \u00b0C. Perinatal problems included premature rupture of membranes, maternal diabetes mellitus, maternal thyroid disease, and maternal infection. Antibiotics were used during the period of hospitalization. Late-onset sepsis was considered when infection was detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures 7 days after delivery, caused by postnatal acquisition (with nosocomial or community sources) of the pathogen. In addition, respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was screened at the time of admission. Patients who tested positive for rotavirus were maintained on conservative therapy, such as fluid therapy and phototherapy until the stool test yielded negative findings in the isolation room.",

The stool test was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the clinical records were retrospectively analyzed. The RIDASCREEN\u00ae Rotavirus was validated by comparison with three commercial rotavirus ELISAs. The sensitivity was 82.1% and specificity was 100% [13].

An electrophoretic analysis revealed that 41% of RV infections occur during winter and 30% of asymptomatic infections occur in other seasons [16]. In addition, other reports on RV infection in neonates suggested a high infection rate with few signs or symptoms [17]. Only 14 (23%) infants infected with RV experienced fever, vomiting, and diarrhea [12]. Several factors have been proposed to be responsible for asymptomatic RV infection observed in neonates, including host features such as physiological immaturity of the neonatal gut, the role of maternal antibodies, and virulence characteristics of the unique neonatal strains. It is known that asymptomatic infants usually develop asymptomatic infections due to the newborn strain, which is completely different from the RV strain found in pediatric patients, but it is known to cause diarrhea, dehydration, jaundice, metabolic acidosis, necrotizing enteritis, and even death [18]. Identifying neonates who are infected with RV is important for infection control in the NICU. The prevalence of RV in hospitals is high, but once mass incidence occurs, it is difficult to block transmission, despite proper patient isolation [19]. Moreover, most infected neonates have no specific enteritis symptoms and go through an incubation period. Therefore, infants with asymptomatic jaundice caused by RV infection should be screened for rapid isolation.",

It is the main reason for hospital readmission during the neonatal period and has long been recognized as a clinical manifestation of infection in the neonate and early infancy [7]. It is known that various infections such as neonatal sepsis, congenital infection, and hepatitis are risk factors for neonatal jaundice. Previous studies have demonstrated that urinary tract infections were associated with jaundice, but there is no such study on RV [8, 9, 20, 21]. In our study of the jaundice group, total bilirubin levels were less than 15 mg/dL in the rotavirus infection group. Rotavirus-induced jaundice did not increase the total bilirubin level more than in other causes. In addition, rotavirus infection is diagnosed early in the disease because it can be screened before other causes.",

            "text": "Besides RV infection, neonates born at term, born via vaginal delivery, those who are exclusively breastfed, and who have high Hb were at high risk in this study. Breastfeeding was associated with neonatal jaundice that lasted longer and reached higher peak levels than milk feeding [21]. Jaundice in breastfed babies usually appears between 24 and 72 h after birth, peaks by 5\u201315 days of life, and disappears by the third week of life; high bilirubin levels have been reported in such infants [22]. While exclusive breastfeeding has historically been an important predictor for jaundice, the mechanism underlying the association is not well understood. Our results demonstrate that vaginal delivery was associated with jaundice. The present findings indicate that naturally delivered neonates were more likely to have jaundice than those born via cesarean section. Previous studies have shown that the risk of jaundice increases in children delivered via cesarean section [5]. Similar to our study, Bulbul et al. [23] reported a statistically significant correlation between the severity of jaundice and mode of delivery. However, other studies have yielded controversial results regarding the relationship between labor and jaundice. Some studies demonstrated a lack of significant relationship between mode of delivery and jaundice [24].",

Although the RIDASCREEN\u00ae RV test has high sensitivity to RV infection, there is a possibility of false positives in the RV test results. Therefore, asymptomatic RV-positive patients can have false-positive results. In addition to the exclusion of 1159 (66%) patients, we excluded patients in the incubation period of rotavirus; this difference may lead to selection bias of the included patients or incorrect risk estimates. However, our study was also meaningful in that all patients admitted to the NICU were screened for RV infection.",
