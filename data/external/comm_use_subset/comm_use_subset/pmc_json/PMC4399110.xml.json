            "text": "Three main clinical syndromes can be distinguished after hantavirus infection, i.e. hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) mainly caused by Seoul, Puumala and Dobrava viruses; nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus; and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, which may be caused by Andes virus and Sin Nombre virus. There is no curative treatment for hantavirus infection, and eliminating or minimising contact with rodents is the best way to prevent infection [1]. The case fatality rate of HFRS varies from <1% to 12% depending on the virus type [2]. Over 50 000 nephropathia epidemica cases with Puumala virus infections have been registered in Europe, and even over 175 000 in Western Russia [3]. Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 humans are hospitalized each year because of hantavirus infections worldwide [2]. European hantaviruses of the family Bunyaviridae cause HFRS. Infection in humans occurs through inhalation of aerosolised virus particles from excreta of chronically infected wild rodents [4]. Puumala is reported throughout most of Europe (excluding the Mediterranean region) wheras Dobrava, carried by the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and Saaremaa, carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), are reported mainly in eastern and central Europe [5]. In Germany, several hantaviruses pathogenic for humans are circulating, i.e. Puumala virus, Dobrava virus and Tula virus [6,7]. Puumala virus is carried by the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) and leads mostly to a mild form of disease [3].",

The most common symptoms are high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache and nausea or vomiting. Proteinuria, haematuria and acute kidney injury are signs of renal involvement. Classically, HFRS occurs in five distinct phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric and convalescent [8]. A severe course of disease comprises oliguria, high blood creatinine and a high leukocyte count [9], the disease severity depends on the hantavirus genotype. A minority of patients needs transient dialysis treatment, but complete recovery is the usual outcome [10,11]. Outinen et al. defined the severity of hantavirus infection by serum creatinine and thrombocytes count [12]. The role of immune response and cytokine expression during Puumala virus infection has been described previously [13,14]. Techniques for the identification of novel hantaviruses by specific cell culture models had been established [15]. Only few cases of Puumala virus infection with severe disease had been reported for Germany recently [16,17].",

Case numbers started to rise earlier during the year than had been reported in previous epidemics in 2007 and 2010, and are the largest ever reported in this region [18,19]. The early rise might be associated with a birch mast year in 2011, followed by an early and massive reproduction of the reservoir of bank vole populations during winter 2011 and spring 2012 [20]. However, a possible influence of climate change on the survival, emergence and epidemiology of hantaviruses is difficult to predict [21].",

Thus viral load clearly plays a role in disease pathogenesis [8]. In a recent study, patients infected with Dobrava virus were found to have a higher viral load than Puumala infected patients [13].

Interestingly, patients with severe disease had significantly lower TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 serum levels than patients with mild disease, suggesting an association of TGF-\u00df1 and TGF-\u00df2 with disease severity (Table 2). All patients had non-detectable TGF-\u03b23 serum levels. The course of cytokine levels for TGF-\u00df1, TGF-\u00df2, as well as CRP and thrombocyte count on admission and one week after admission to the hospital is shown in Figure 2 and Table 3. TGF-\u00df1 and TGF-\u00df2 concentrations on admission imply a stronger TGF-\u00df1 and TGF-\u00df2 production in patients with severe than in patients with mild disease (Figure 2). Both patient groups had similar CRP level and thrombocyte count one week after admission. Creatinine remained significantly higher in patients with severe disease during follow-up (data not shown). ROC curve analysis was performed for TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22 as well as for TGF-\u03b21/Cr and TGF-\u03b22/Cr ratios on admission. TGF-\u03b21/Cr ratio showed the best association with severe disease, followed by TGF-\u03b21/Cr ratio (Figure 3).",

There are only few reports about the role of anti-inflammatory and suppressive cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 in hantavirus infection. Temonen et al. investigated kidney biopsies of patients with nephropathia epidemica and described an increased expression of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, and platelet-derived growth factormainly in the peritubular area of the distal nephron. Concomitantly also at the same location expression of the endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM, and PECAM was seen [27]. Similarly, it was shown in a more recent study of deer mice infected with Sin Nombre virus, that TGF-\u03b21 expressing regulatory T cells may play an important role in limiting immunopathology in the natural reservoir host, but this response may interfere with viral clearance [28]. In a previous study it was shown that disease severity characterized by elevated creatinine and low platelet counts was correlated with high pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 but low immunosuppressive TGF-\u03b21 levels and vice versa, suggesting the induction of a protective immune mechanism to downregulate or even prevent a massive pro-inflammatory immune response [14]. Klempa et al. described mild and severe cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in patients infected with Dobrava-Belgrade virus in Russia [29]. In accordance with our results, they found a high number of patients with headache in severe hantavirus infection and elevated creatinine in severe course of the disease. In the current study, we were able to illustrate the role of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u00df2 as major protective markers of hantavirus infection. With increased production in patients with severe disease as a response to inflammation [30,31], TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 serum levels reached similar levels in both patient groups one week after admission. Obviously, patients with severe disease generate TGF-\u00df delayed compared to patients with mild disease allowing stronger proinflammatory cytokine responses and inflammation in these patients.",

Inflammatory cell infiltrations and tubular damage were found in the kidneys, and these infiltrations contained mainly CD8 T-cells [33]. As reported by Rook et al., TGF-\u03b2 exerts profound inhibitory effects on T and B lymphocyte proliferation [34]. T regulatory (Treg)- and T suppressor (Ts)-mediated immunosuppression appears to depend on two pathways: cell\u2013cell contact and cytokine secretion, whereby cytokine secretion is assumed to be more important. Intracellular cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 are characteristic for certain Treg subsets and are related with induced Treg function. Stimulation by mitogens significantly induce TGF-\u03b2+-Treg and -Ts. Tregs are an important component in regulating the magnitude of the immune response to infection, thus preventing excessive inflammation and tissue damage [35]. In previous studies it was suggested that IFN-\u03b3-secreting Treg are forming the first line of immunoregulatory T cells during an initiated immune response, followed by IL-2\u2212, IL-10+, or TGF-\u03b2+ Treg. Thus, high serum levels of TGF-\u03b2s during the acute phase and convalescence period of hantavirus infection might be a protective parameter against pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial injury. We found a positive correlation of both TGF-\u03b2s with platelet counts and GFR. In contrast to TGF-\u03b2s, serum sCD30 and neopterin showed no significant correlation with main symptoms of disease.",

To exclude cytokine accumulation due to dysfunction of renal excretion, cytokine/creatinine ratios were calculated. For ease of viewing, TGF-\u03b21 is shown in ng/ml, whereas TGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b23 are shown in pg/ml. Serum neopterin was measured with the Neopterin ELISA kit (Brahms, Berlin, Germany). Based on control measurements in 36 healthy individuals, neopterin concentrations >15 nmol/l is considered above normal range. Sera were tested for serum sCD30 content using a commercially available ELISA kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). All cytokines, neopterin and CRP were determined on admission of the patients to the hospital and one week after admission.",
