In that study 4758 bats of ten different species from Ghana, and 272 Pipistrellus bats from four European countries were included [8]. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect coronavirus RNA. Of the ten bat species tested in Ghana, only Nycteris gambiensis was found to carry 2c beta-coronavirus. A round one fourth of the 185 Nycteris bats tested positive; this accounted for 1 % of whole tested bat\u2019s population from Ghana. Of the Pipistrellus bat species tested in Europe, 40 out of 272 (14.7 %) carried 2c beta-coronavirus. Both 2c beta-coronaviruses isolated are genetically very closely related to MERS-CoV. This relatedness indicates that MERS-CoV likely originated from bats [8]. Though the study had a good sample size and screened different geographical areas, none of those areas is known for MERS-CoV infection in humans or domestic animals.",

In order to better understand the ecology of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels, three adult dromedary camels were inoculated with a human isolate of MERS-CoV. Each dromedary camel was inoculated though intratracheal, intranasal and conjunctival routes. Transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the three camels. Each dromedary camel shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract, evidenced by the presence of infectious viruses in nasal swab samples and, to a lesser extent, in oral samples. No infectious virus or viral RNA was detected in fecal, urine, serum or whole blood samples [20]. After authentication, the virus was recovered from respiratory tissues and some lymph nodes draining the respiratory system of one dromedary camel, but not in any other organs. These findings were consistent with the data from naturally infected dromedary camels [6, 15, 21, 22]. Some studies reported the detection of MERS-CoV virus from fecal specimen, though virus detection rates were far lower than in nasal swab specimens [22\u201324]. One study in particular reported detection of MERS-CoV RNA in the milk of five out of seven infected dromedary camels [23].",

This indicates that a small proportion of Canary Island dromedary camels were exposed to the virus at some point in time.

In this study, a representative sample of 170 dromedary camels on the Canary Islands was investigated; only 4.1 % were seropositive for MERS-CoV.
