These viruses are categorized as biosafety level 4 (BSL4) pathogens due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with disease and the lack of approved vaccines and therapeutics for human use. The primary reservoir for henipaviruses are bats of the genus Pteropus[2]; however; the viruses can be transmitted to many mammalian species including humans. Currently, there are two distinct strains of NiV: 1) the Malaysia strain (NiVM) discovered in 1999 during an outbreak on pig farms which resulted in spread to humans [3]; and 2) the Bangladesh strain (NiVB), which was discovered in India and Bangladesh during 2001 [4]. NiVB has been linked to direct transmission from bats to humans and evidence suggests human to human transmission is possible [5].",

To date, there have been four experimental preventive candidate vaccines against henipaviruses evaluated in animal models. Vaccinia and canarypox viruses encoding the NiVM glycoproteins have shown protection against NiVM in hamsters and pigs [7,8]. A recombinant adeno-associated vaccine expressing the NiVM G protein completely protected hamsters against homologous NiVM challenge and protected 50% of animals against heterologous HeV infection [9]. In addition, a recombinant subunit vaccine based on the HeV G protein (sGHeV) completely protects small animals against lethal HeV and NiVM infection [10-13] and more recently was shown to be efficacious in the robust African green monkey model of NiVM infection [14]. Though very promising, the sGHeV vaccine requires a prime-boost strategy to confer protection whereas a single-injection vaccine would be particularly beneficial during outbreaks where there is little time to employ lengthy vaccination regimens.",

            "text": "To investigate the protective efficacy of rVSV NiVB vaccine vectors against heterologous NiVM challenge in ferrets, we first developed and recovered two rVSV\u0394G constructs expressing the NiVB F protein rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/F-GFP (Figure 1A, blue) or NiVB G protein rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/G-GFP (Figure 1A, yellow) using reverse genetics. Propagation of these vectors requires VSV glycoprotein (GInd) complementation (GInd*) of viruses where GInd is provided in trans during infection [33]. GInd* complementation allows for single-cycle replication of vectors and results in expression of the NiVB glycoproteins and the production non-infectious virions containing either glycoprotein. As seen previously with similar NiVM rVSV vectors [28], co-infection with GInd* rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/F-GFP and GInd* rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/G-GFP produced infectious virions (rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/F/G-GFP) containing either genome with the NiVB F and NiVB G proteins incorporated in the virion envelope (Figure 1A, Group 4 green-spiked virion) as evidenced by the ability of these virus preparations to infect Vero cells (Figure 1B, *) and the inability of the rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/F-GFP and rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/G-GFP to infect cells without GInd* complementation (negative data not shown). The rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/F/G-GFP virus stocks were able to reach titers of up to 3 \u00d7 108 PFU/ml and infection of Vero cells with these stocks resulted in syncytia formation (Figure 1B). While this vaccine preparation could undergo a single round of replication, it could not be passaged further without GInd* complementation as was observed with the rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/F-GFP and rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/G-GFP vaccine preparations.",

Serum collected from each animal on the day of vaccination (day -28) and just before challenge (day 0) was analyzed for circulating IgG to the NiV F and NiV G proteins by microsphere assay [30]. As expected, we did not detect NiV F-specific Ig in sera before vaccination (Figure 2B, day -28). We were able to detect Ig directed at NiV F in sera of the Group 2 and 4 vaccinated cohorts 28 days after vaccination but not in the ferrets from Groups 1 and 3 (Figure 2B, day 0). Similar to the analysis of NiV F-specific circulating IgG in vaccinated ferrets, we were unable to detect IgG directed to NiV G before vaccination (Figure 2C, day -28) and were able to detect anti-NiV G IgG 28 days post vaccination (Figure 2C, day -28). Animals in Group 3 had higher levels of circulating anti-NiV G IgG when compared to Group 4 and surprisingly we were able to detect anti-NiV G IgG in Group 2 animals although not to the levels of the NiVB G-specifically vaccinated Group 3 animals (Figure 2C, day -0). These results suggested that the animals in Groups 2-4 and not Group 1 had generated a humoral immune response to the rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB antigens delivered in a single injection.",

The animals were closely monitored over the course of 22 days post challenge (p.c.) for clinical signs of illness. The specifically vaccinated animals in Groups 2-4 did not lose weight over the course of the study (Figure 3A) and were 100% protected against NiVM (Figure 3B), while the animals in the non-specifically vaccinated Group 1 succumbed to infection on days 7 or 8 (Figure 2A, ^), respectively (Figure 3B, Table 1). Clinical scores were recorded each day after challenge for each animal using a scoring system based on coat grooming, social behavior, and provoked behavior. The clinical scores for each animal correlated with the survival data as seen with the mean clinical score for each animal in the vaccinated groups having no score on any day p.c. versus the animals in Group 1 having clinical scores on days 5 to 8 p.c. Clinical signs in response to NiVB infection were more dramatic for the animals in Groups 1 when compared to the animals in the other three groups (Table 1). In all animals that succumbed to NiVM infection, the gross pathologic findings included varying severity of dehydration, ventral cervical subcutaneous hemorrhage with edema (Figure 4A) and crusting serous nasal discharge (Figure 4B). The internal gross pathologic findings from animals in Group 1 included varying severity of heavy, wet, diffusely mottled with dark pin point foci throughout the pulmonary parenchyma, multifocal pin point raised foci throughout the renal parenchyma, mottling of the spleen with diffuse splenomegaly, and diffuse reticulation of the liver. Each animal had diffuse hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonia (Figure 4C) and splenomegaly with multifocal necrosis (pic 4D, *). Additionally, diffuse reticulation of the liver (Figure 4D, +) and multifocal renal hemorrhage (Figure 4D, arrow) were noted. There were no external or internal gross pathologic findings of note in any of the Group 2-4 animals at the study endpoint (Figure 2A, day 22 ^).",

All four groups lacked neutralizing antibody titers before vaccination (Figure 7A). On the day of challenge, animals from control Group 1 did not have neutralizing antibody titers against NiVM whereas all ferrets from Groups 2-4 had neutralizing antibodies against NiVM (Figure 7B), although it appeared that Groups 2 and 3 had higher titers than Group 4. Neutralizing antibody titers were also assessed for all animals from terminal bleeds on the day of death (day 7 or 8) or at day 21. All animals that succumbed to NiVM challenge in Group 1 had consistently lower neutralizing antibody titers against NiVM when compared to the neutralizing antibodies found in animals from Groups 2-4 (Figure 7C).",

            "text": "While significant progress on a veterinary vaccine for one henipavirus, HeV, has been made [34], the development of effective human vaccines and antiviral drugs for high consequence pathogens such as NiV is a much slower and complicated process. In particular, the restriction of infectious NiV work to BSL-4 containment has hampered progress. Conventional clinical trials with viruses such as NiV are not practical. To address the development of countermeasures for exotic pathogens such as NiV the FDA implemented the Animal Efficacy Rule in 2002. This rule specifically applies to the development of countermeasures when human efficacy studies are not possible or ethical. Briefly, this rule permits the evaluation of vaccines or therapeutics using data generated from studies performed in animal models that faithfully recapitulate human disease. There are currently at least eight animal models for NiV including the IFNAR-KO mouse model [35]; the guinea pig model [36]; the pig model [8,37-39]; the cat model [10,11]; the golden Syrian hamster model [7,40-42]; the ferret model [30,43]; and two nonhuman primate models, one in squirrel monkeys [44] and the other in African green monkeys [32]. While each of these models shares at least one or more aspects seen in human pathogenesis and can contribute to vaccine and therapeutic testing, the two animal models which completely emulate the pathogenesis seen in human cases to date are the ferret model and the African green monkey model. These models recapitulate what is seen during human infection with severe respiratory and neurologic disease and a generalized vasculitis.",

Animals in Group 2 vaccinated with GInd* rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/F-GFP generated anti-NiV F IgGs (and possible cross-reactive NiV G IgG, Figure 2C) and neutralizing antibody titers against NiVM and were protected from NiVM-induced disease with one animal (Table 1, 2-5) having a low-grade fever on day 7 p.c. Similarly, ferrets in Group 3 vaccinated with GInd* rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB/G-GFP generated anti-NiV G IgGs and neutralizing antibody titers against NiVM and were protected from NiVM-induced disease. Using vectors that were independent of GInd* complementation, ferrets in Group 4 vaccinated with rVSV-\u0394G-NiVB-F/G-GFP generated anti-NiV F and anti-NiV G IgGs and neutralizing antibody titers against NiVM and were also protected from NiVM-induced disease. The observation that the percent weight growth was less than Group 2 and 3 (Figure 3A) could have been due to the social housing of these animals where it is possible that certain members of the cohort were out competed for extra food as some animals in this group reached percent weight growth of animals from the other groups. While the protection afforded to Groups 2-4 did not appear to be sterile as virus replication could be detected by the presence of viral RNA in whole blood at day 6 p.c., it was only detected in two animals per group versus all animals in Group 1 (Table 1) and the mean virus replication was 100 times lower than what was detected in animals from Group 1 (Figure 6A).",

One possible explanation is that the antibodies produced in response to the NiVB G results in the formation of some antibodies that can recognize NiVM F since the target antigen in the Bioplex assay is NiVM F. Our experience with the sGHeV vaccine may not be applicable here as this cross-reactivity may be a single-cycle replicating vaccine observation.

While multi-dose vaccine regimens would be feasible for laboratory and healthcare workers and some military personnel in stable settings with defined risk, an outbreak setting or a case of deliberate release would require rapidly conferred protection with a single administration. Here we describe the protection of ferrets from NiVM-induced disease using single-injection rVSV vaccine vectors expressing the NiVB F and/or NiVB G proteins. To date, this is the first study to show efficacy of a vaccine against NiV using a single administration in the ferret model.

The NiVM challenge virus stock was assessed for the presence of endotoxin using The Endosafe\u00ae-Portable Test System (PTS) (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). Virus preparations were diluted 1:10 in Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Reagent Water (LRW) per manufacturer\u2019s directions and endotoxin levels were tested in LAL Endosafe\u00ae-PTS cartridges as directed by the manufacturer. Each preparation was found to be below detectable limits while positive controls showed that the tests were valid.",
