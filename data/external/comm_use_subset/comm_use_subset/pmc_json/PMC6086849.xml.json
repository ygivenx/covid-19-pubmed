Among the otherwise healthy young adults with ARI symptoms and a sample of their social contacts participating in this study during a single season, winter season, the prevalence of the 4 HCoVs combined was 19.7% among specimens from participants with ARI, 14.1% among social contacts with symptoms, and 6.7% among asymptomatic social contacts. Codetection of viruses was found in 12 specimens collected during the study period, including one triple codetection with HCoV\u2010HKU1, influenza A, and rhinovirus. Influenza A was the most commonly detected virus among specimens collected from ARI participants, while HCoV\u2010NL63 was the most frequent virus detected 6 days following illness onset. We found that moderate/severe cough, chills, and headache decreased in frequency over the 6\u2010day period among students with HCoV infections, while runny nose increased in frequency over the 6\u2010day period; no similar frequency trends were observed among symptomatic social contacts with HCoV. While statistically significant differences were observed between patients providing specimens and participants not providing specimens in age and parental education, the significantly higher portion of patients not providing specimens with a seasonal influenza vaccination status is likely of concern for interpretation. The differences potentially suggest that receiving a vaccination decreased the likelihood of providing a specimen during our study, an area to note for future studies with a voluntary specimen collection component.",

A household study that used similar RT\u2010PCR methods conducted over the same period as our study in southeast Michigan found a prevalence of 16% of HCoVs among individuals with ARI, but they did not examine the prevalence among non\u2010ARI contacts.24\n",

Unpublished data from a pilot study conducted among an independent sample of 574 students followed from February to April 2011, resulted in few patients with ARI providing specimens (25), but we found a similar prevalence for HCoVs (16%; 4/25) in a similar young adult population (unpublished data available from corresponding author upon request). Further long\u2010term annual studies of HCoVs in this community are needed to determine whether there is a seasonal effect or whether there is consistently higher prevalence among young adults in the university setting.",

Other clinic\u2010based studies, predominantly among children, have reported the occurrence of codetected viruses.6, 8, 27, 28 However, studies outside of the clinical setting are rare. A study of healthy preschool\u2010aged children in Australia reported twice the prevalence of codetection (56%), but their sample size was smaller (n = 18) and young children tend to have higher rates of respiratory illness than young adults.29 These studies suggest that viral codetection is frequent in children. In contrast to these studies, our study designed allowed for multiple samples taken from the same participant, potentially increasing the likelihood that we would find individuals positive for multiple viruses. Overall, coviral infection appears to be less commons among university students compared to younger age individuals. More research is needed on adults to determine risk factors for coinfections among relatively healthy individuals with developed immune systems.",

The statistically significant decrease in cough, chills, and headache and increase in runny nose over the 6\u2010day period for the HCoV observed in our study suggest that symptoms change significantly over the course of natural infection, making it difficult to delineate between viral etiologies associated with common ARI. The similarity of our findings with those of another study conducted in the region during the same season24 suggests that university students were under similar regional viral pressure. Due to the low level of severe illness, screening for these viruses in a university setting does not seem necessary. However, it does seem likely that increased testing in the university setting, even among those with mild symptoms, would result in a high number of viruses detected.

Additionally, prevalence estimates include samples that were taken at up to 3 time points within the first 6 days of illness, providing a greater opportunity to identify virus\u2010positive samples compared to other study designs. Further, our testing for viruses was not exhaustive; the 13 viruses included were selected for their frequency of appearance as upper respiratory viruses in the population, as well as their clinical importance. However, additional respiratory viruses may have been present; as a result, the number of codetected viruses identified in this study is likely underestimated. Finally, seasonality may have influenced our findings.
