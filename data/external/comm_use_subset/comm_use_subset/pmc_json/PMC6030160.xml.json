Many infectious disease studies showed that virus cross-species transmissions are highly prevalent resulting in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs)1. EIDs continue to pose significant public health problems as shown by the recent outbreaks of West Nile virus, SARS, MARS, and H1N12. Rapidly identifying the reservoir of the new pathogenic bacterial or viral origins responsible for these diseases will help the containment, control, and prevention of the outbreaks1,3,4. Further, investigating the potential host of a virus can throw light on the evolutionary history of the virus, thus provide guidance on how to cut off the transmission path. The biological presumption for most of the host identification methods is that the more similar two viruses\u2019 DNA/RNA sequences are, they are more likely to share the same host5.",

Tang et al.10 developed a support vector machine (SVM) based method using mono- and dinucleotide frequencies as features to detect the original hosts of coronaviruses with high accuracy.

For the coronavirus dataset, SVM outperforms alignment based method followed by alignment-free method when the sample size is low. When the number of samples is large, eg. over 400, all the three methods perform similarly. Finally, for the influenza A virus, none of the methods performs well with prediction accuracies below 0.6.
