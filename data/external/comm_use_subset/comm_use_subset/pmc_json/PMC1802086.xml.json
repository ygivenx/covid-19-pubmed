            "text": "Over the past 25 years, there has been increasing concern about the impacts of the plethora of natural and anthropogenic chemicals discharged into the aquatic environment that disrupt the endocrine system of wildlife [1]. Typically, these endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exert their actions via interactions with the nuclear steroid hormone receptors. The most well characterised, and of greatest current concern, are EDCs which bind to and activate the estrogen receptor: so-called environmental estrogens (for a review, see [2]). The international research effort on chemically-induced endocrine disruption has been driven by unequivocal evidence that environmental estrogens alter sexual development and function in fish (for a review, see [3]), and effects on other physiological processes, including growth, development, osmoregulation, and stress and immune responses, have also been reported (reviewed in [4]). An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which these effects occur is critical if we are to fully assess the potential health implications of exposure to environmental estrogens, both for fish and for other vertebrates.",

            "text": "Attempts to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of environmental estrogens in the body are increasingly being conducted at the level of gene expression (reviewed in [5]). Real-time reverse transcription PCR is presently the most sensitive method for the detection of mRNAs [6], and is also often employed for the validation of gene expression data from high-throughput array experiments [7]. Quantitative analysis of gene expression using real-time PCR typically requires the use of a constitutively expressed 'housekeeping' gene as an internal control to normalize for differences in starting cDNA template between samples (reviewed in [8,9]). The fundamental requirement for validation of the expression stability of an internal control gene prior to its use in the system being studied is also well-defined. Nevertheless, in contrast to the situation for many mammalian experimental systems (e.g. [10-12]), studies investigating the effects of environmental estrogens on gene expression in non-mammalian vertebrates have used 'housekeeping' genes more or less randomly as internal controls, and without any validation of their expression stability in the system being studied, which may have serious implications for the interpretation of the effects data.",

Eight 'housekeeping' genes were selected for assessment, including 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ribosomal protein l8 (rpl8), elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1a), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd), beta actin (bactin), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (hprt1), and tata box binding protein (tbp) in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas; a fish species widely used in ecotoxicology). These genes were chosen based on their previous use as internal controls in gene expression studies, the availability of 'housekeeping' gene sequences in fathead minnow and related teleost species, and because they have roles in different cellular functions (ribosomal structure [18S rRNA], protein biosynthesis [rpl8 and ef1a], cytoskeletal structure [bactin], glucose metabolism [g6pd and gapdh], nucleoside metabolism [hprt1]), and transcription initiation [tbp]) thus reducing the likelihood that they exhibited regulated covariation. The genes of interest chosen to quantify responses to estrogen were vitellogenin (vtg), which encodes a protein that acts as a precursor of yolk, and cytochrome P450 1A (cyp1a), that codes for an enzyme involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, both of which are frequently used for studies on environmental estrogens in fish.",

Specifically, these genes comprised 18S rRNA, rpl8, ef1a, g6pd, bactin, gapdh, hprt1, and tbp. These 'housekeeping' genes have been validated previously for use as internal controls in many experimental systems, particularly in mammals (18S rRNA: e.g. [10-12]; ribosomal proteins: e.g. [13-15]; ef1a: e.g. [13,14,16]; g6pd: e.g. [17,18]; bactin: e.g. [10,19]), gapdh: e.g. [19,20]; hprt1: e.g. [19,21-23]; tbp e.g. [19]), but have not been validated for work on estrogens in fish. The development of the required real-time PCR assays for some of the target 'housekeeping' genes, whose sequences were not publicly available in the study species (18S rRNA, rp18, ef1a), first required the cloning of the full- or partial-length sequences for these genes.",

            "text": "Our data clearly show that the expression levels of some 'housekeeping' genes are regulated by estrogen in fathead minnow. In particular, ef1a, g6pd, bactin, and gapdh were found to be strongly regulated by estrogen, and this is consistent with data published for other teleosts. Down-regulation of bactin was shown to occur in array analyses conducted on liver tissue from male sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegates) exposed to the environmental estrogens E2, EE2, diethylstilbestrol (DES), NP, and methoxychlor [5]. This concurs with the observations that E2 and several other estrogenic compounds disrupt cytoskeletal compounds in vitro [34-36]. In contrast, bactin expression has been shown to be increased in liver of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to EE2 [29,37], and in pituitary of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) exposed to E2 and NP [38]. Expression of gapdh in livers of plaice and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has also been shown to be repressed by various environmental estrogens, including EE2 [28,29,39]. Further evidence of estrogen-regulation of bactin and gapdh coming from mammalian studies [40-43] strengthens the case that their use as internal controls for studies for quantification of gene expression with estrogen treatment is probably inappropriate. The down-regulation of hepatic ef1a and g6pd by EE2 observed in the present study also concurs with data from zebrafish embryos [39], where two ef1a isoforms were down-regulated by estrogen, and from the European flounder (Platichthys flesus), where E2 inhibited activity of the G6pd enzyme in hepatocytes by 30% in males and 80% in females [44]. In fact, estrogen-regulation of g6pd provides a likely explanation for differences we observed in hepatic g6pd expression between the sexes in this study (lower expression in females; data not shown), since female fish have higher circulating levels of endogenous estrogens than males. The effect of estrogen on gapdh and g6pd expression observed here likely results from their involvement in metabolism, since estrogens, like other sex steroids, are well known to have roles in the regulation of the metabolic processes associated with altered energy demands during gonad development and reproduction in fish [45-47]. Moreover, several other metabolic enzymes are also known to be controlled by sex steroids including estrogens in fish [27,46,48].",

Complex effects of estrogens (including tissue-, gender-, and/or developmental-stage-specific effects) have been demonstrated for many estrogen-regulated genes, including 'housekeeping' genes, in fish and higher vertebrates (e.g. [4,41]) and this suggests that these genes may have different roles in different tissues, and different roles in males compared with in females in these tissues.

The high stability of rpl8 expression following estrogen treatment conforms with data from largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), where the expression of a suite of 11 ribosomal proteins, including rpl8, did not fluctuate appreciably (<1.3-fold) in response to estrogenic compounds, and ribosomal proteins were thus recommended for use as internal control genes in microarray experiments involving estrogen treatments [33]. However, the results of another study on rainbow trout demonstrated EE2-induction of the ribosomal protein ribosomal protein s3 (rps3) [28], emphasising that not all ribosomal proteins may be estrogen-independent. Although there is no other data currently available concerning possible estrogen regulation of hprt1 and tbp in fish, hprt has been described as an estrogen-independent 'housekeeping' gene in mammals [21], supporting our findings here.",

In that study however, and based on array analyses, 18S rRNA was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner in zebrafish liver after a shorter term (24 hour) exposure to EE2, suggesting that any 18S rRNA regulation by estrogen may occur in a temporal manner. Although rRNAs have been advocated for use as internal controls in many other experimental systems and their levels are thought to be less likely to vary under conditions that affect the expression of mRNAs (e.g. [10-12,49]), there is some evidence that another rRNA, 28S rRNA, is also regulated by estrogen in fish [29]. Moreover, some clear disadvantages in the use of rRNAs as internal controls have been highlighted by other researchers (e.g. see [17,50,51]. Most notably, rRNAs can only be used as internal controls for total RNA preparations (since mRNA purification methods randomly remove them) and cannot be used when an oligo(dT) reverse transcription has been carried out. The use of rRNAs, which constitute 80\u201390% of total RNA, has also been criticised due to their very high general expression level which far exceeds that for mRNAs (e.g. [51,52]). A very high general level of expression of 18S rRNA was also observed in the current study (18S rRNA had a mean Ct of approximately 11, compared to mean Cts of approximately 23\u201332 for the other candidate 'housekeeping' genes). It is imperative, therefore, that these issues are considered if selecting 18S rRNA as an internal control for studies on environmental estrogens in fish.",

When the amount of input cDNA was normalized, vtg mRNA expression in liver was highly (approximately 200-fold) up-regulated by EE2 in males (but not in females), while cyp1a mRNA expression was down-regulated by EE2 in both sexes (to between 15\u201328% of the control level), and these findings were as expected and in agreement with the current literature (e.g. [32,53,54]).

As expected, the use of appropriate 'housekeeping' genes (18S rRNA, rpl8, tbp, or hprt1; which were not affected by the EE2 treatment) for the normalizations, gave very similar results to the data generated when the input cDNA amount was normalized, demonstrating that the use of these genes is valid and effectively normalizes for differences in input cDNA. In contrast, when 'housekeeping' genes down-regulated by the EE2 treatment (ef1a, g6pd, bactin, or gapdh) were used, the expression levels of the genes of interest were overestimated, which lead to inappropriate conclusions about the manner in which these genes were regulated, or not regulated, by estrogen, and/or the degree to which they were estrogen-regulated. Likewise, if a 'housekeeping' gene which was up-regulated by EE2 had been used for normalization, the expression levels of the genes of interest would have been underestimated. These findings have major implications for studies on the effects and potential impacts of environmental estrogens in fish that use internal control genes that have not been validated for the specifics of the experimental system, and in particular for studies which require to detect small changes in the expression of the gene of interest. An interesting aside from this work has been to show that an environmental concentration of EE2 is capable of disrupting expression of a suite of genes that play key roles in general cell function and maintenance, adding further to the concern about the potential impacts of this estrogen in the aquatic environment.",

An aliquot of each cDNA sample was then normalized (by dilution with molecular-grade water) such that all the samples contained equal amounts (20 ng/\u03bcl) of cDNA template for real-time PCR.",

Full-length (for ef1a) or partial-length (for 18S rRNA and rpl8) sequences were obtained from fathead minnow whole body tissue using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), 5'-/3'-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE), cloning, and automated fluorescence sequencing strategies as described in detail previously [56]. The full-length fathead minnow ef1a cDNA sequence [1748 bp; GenBank: AY643400] was obtained in four consecutive steps consisting of (a) an RT-PCR to obtain a core partial-length fragment of the cDNA using primers designed from regions of ef1a cDNAs conserved between fish species available in the NCBI GenBank database ('Core PCR 1'), (b) a second RT-PCR to extend the initial core partial-length fragment towards the 5'-end ('Core PCR 2'), (c) a 5'-RACE to obtain the 5'-end of the cDNA ('5'-RACE'), and (d) a 3'-RACE to obtain the 3'-end of the cDNA ('3'-RACE'). The partial-length fathead minnow 18S rRNA (768 bp; GenBank: AY855349) and rpl8 (708 bp; GenBank: AY919670) sequences were obtained by separate RT-PCRs using primers designed from conserved regions of 18S rRNAs and rpl8 cDNAs available in the NCBI GenBank database. For PCR primer sequences, annealing temperatures, cycle numbers and product sizes, see Additional File 1: Filby and Tyler Additional File 1. Sequence identities were confirmed using BLASTn [57] and phylogenetic analyses within CLUSTAL X [58].",

Assays were optimized and validated for real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green chemistry as described previously [56]. All assays had detection ranges of at least five orders of magnitude. Specificity of primer sets throughout this range of detection was confirmed by the observation of single amplification products of the expected size, melting temperature and sequence. All assays were quantitative, with standard curve (mean Ct vs. log cDNA dilution) slopes of between -2.794 and -3.533, translating to high real-time PCR efficiency (E) values of 1.92\u20132.28. Over the detection range, the linear correlation (R2) between the mean Ct and the logarithm of the cDNA dilution was >0.99 in each case.

Assays had a high level of precision and reproducibility with intra-assay coefficient of variation of 2.42 %; (n = 96). Inter-assay coefficient of variation was not measured because all of the samples for each gene were run on the same plate. The expression of each 'housekeeping' gene was calculated using the 2-\u0394Ct method described in [59] but employed the actual measured E value for each 'housekeeping' gene rather than assuming E = 2 ('efficiency correction'). The 2-\u0394Ct formula is a modification of the arithmetic comparative 2\u0394\u0394Ct method [59] that was developed to enable normalization to a measurement external to the PCR experiment (in this case, input cDNA), for measuring the expression of 'housekeeping' genes following different treatments. This method expressed the data as the fold-increase in expression from the mean of the experimental group set as the calibrator (the control treatment) and, therefore, enabled direct comparison of the expression of 'housekeeping' genes with different general levels of expression.",
