The continuing threat of Plasmodium falciparum malaria [2, 3] and dengue [4], the rapid, near pandemic spread of Zika virus [5] or the recent epizootic outbreak of Yersinia pestis (plague) in Madagascar [6] are just some examples of pathogens transmitted by insect vectors that pose a major threat to global public health. Their dependence on insects for transmission between vertebrate hosts has a number of important implications. First, they are frequently subject to strong spatial and temporal fluctuations due to environmental and climatic variations, such as seasonality in rainfall or temperature. Second, these pathogens should be amenable to vector control. That is, disease transmission can, at least in theory, be interrupted simply by removing the insect vector (e.g. use of insecticides) or by preventing contact between the vector and the host (e.g. use of bednets). Furthermore, it has been suggested that only a fraction of insects need to be removed or vector-host contacts to be prevented for the disease to die out. This concept is largely based on mathematical theory that can be traced back to the first formal description and mathematical treatment of the malaria life-cycle by Ross [7]. Unfortunately, translating theoretical predictions to practical applications, especially with regards to disease elimination through vector control, has only resulted in partial success.",

To date, R0 is frequently used either to predict the extent of an epidemic outbreak or to derive the necessary conditions to prevent this outbreak from happening, e.g. by means of vaccination. The crux of the problem is how to robustly derive or estimate this number in the first place. Compartmentalised systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been in use for decades to understand infectious diseases at the population level and provide the backbone for most formulas for R0 [9]. These allow the reproduction number to be computed either exclusively using empirically informed parameter estimates or from the initial growth rate of an outbreak [10]. Although the latter is the more common approximation method for directly-transmitted disease [11\u201314], it has equally been applied to vector-borne pathogens [15\u201317].",

            "text": "An important consideration for R0 estimates of vector-borne pathogens is that these can vary substantially across space and time. For example, reported R0 estimates for the complete transmission cycle of Plasmodium falciparum in Africa range from 1 to more than 3,000 [18, 19]. Based on nine epidemics in Brazil between 1996 and 2003, the reproduction number for dengue has been estimated to be somewhere between 2 to 103 [20], and median estimates for Zika range between 2.6\u20134.8 in French Polynesia [21] and 4\u20139 in Rio de Janiero [22]. The reasons for such wide variations are manifold. As mentioned earlier, the dependence on insect vectors for transmission can naturally introduce large spatio-temporal heterogeneities. That is, a disease introduced during the dry season will behave very differently to the same disease being introduced during the rainy seasons. Equally, an outbreak in a densely populated urban area will likely take a different course than an outbreak in a sparsely populated rural area. Here we argue that in addition to these natural variations and potential differences in data collection and analyses, the actual methodologies used to derive R0 estimates can also introduce substantial discrepancies.",

As infectious vectors are assumed to continue to transmit the disease until death, the VHTP is determined both by the life expectancy of the vector and the extrinsic incubation period of the pathogen. For mathematical simplicity, most epidemiological models of vector-borne diseases assume that vectors have a constant (daily) mortality rate. However, this assumption is in stark contrast to findings from lab-based and field mark-and-recapture studies. For example, survival probabilities of the dengue mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and the principal malaria vectors Anopheles stephensi and An. gambia have been shown to be strongly age-dependent [24\u201327]. Although it should be clear that current lab and field-based studies of vector survivorship come with their own set of limitations and uncertainties, constant, i.e. age-independent mortality rates are biologically less likely than assuming a general decrease in the survival probability with age.",

However, the effects of assuming constant vector mortality on R0 in a system where death rates are strongly age-dependent have not yet been explored. Here we compared a commonly used R0 formula based on continuous-time differential equation model using constant mortality rates to an R0 estimate derived from first principles under relaxed assumptions about vector mortality. Using a stochastic, individual-based simulation model (IBM), which permits the direct measurement of the average number of secondary cases, we demonstrate how the underlying assumptions of vector survivorship can significantly inflate R0 estimates. We further show how estimates based on endemic equilibria are generally more robust and derive a correction factor to ameliorate R0-inflations in estimation methods based on epidemic growth curves.",

The small discrepancy between the two models is due to the ODE model\u2019s assumption of an exponentially distributed extrinsic incubation period, whereas the IBM assumes this to be a fixed length of time. Using the IBM approach to track individual mosquitoes and infection events we also find that under this assumption the mean age at which vectors become infected is 20 days and infectious at an age of 25 days, i.e. days beyond their average life-expectancy. Furthermore, those vectors that have become infectious live for an average of 46 days, which means that their infectious period is 21 days (equal to the life expectancy of all vectors). This clearly highlights the discrepancy between model outputs based on constant mortality rates and biological reality. In contrast, assuming age-dependent mortality rates (Weibull shape parameter, cV = 4) results in biologically more reasonable infectious periods of 11 days (Table 2) and R0 estimates that are less than half of those based on a model with constant mortality.",

One of the most important factors influencing R0 is the length at which an individual remains infectious. For vector-transmitted diseases this places huge significance on vector mortality rates as vectors usually do not clear an infection and instead remain infectious for life. Many formulas to estimate R0 are based on systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which commonly assume that vector mortality is constant, i.e. independent of age. As we have demonstrated here, the resulting exponential distribution and the effective resetting of life expectancies as individuals transition through the infection stages permit some vectors to live for an extraordinary length of time. As a result, vectors are potentially able to transmit the disease multiple times that of what should biologically be possible, leading to significantly inflated R0 estimates.",

Because individual infection events can easily be tracked within an IBM, the basic reproduction number can essentially be measured simply by counting the number of secondary infections arising from a single index case. This in turn not only allowed us to compare different formulas for estimating R0 but also provided us with a better understanding of the degree of uncertainty surrounding these estimates.",

Importantly, it is not so much that the formulas commonly used to estimate R0 are inherently wrong but rather that the underlying assumption of the models from which they are derived are not necessarily aligned with biological reality. We found that one of the most robust methods to estimate a pathogen\u2019s R0 is based on the proportion of susceptible individuals at endemic equilibrium, as this is entirely parameter free and does not require any assumption about vector death rates. Unfortunately, this only works for diseases that are well established in a population, and its reliability is strongly dependent on the stochasticity of the underlying endemic equilibrium, i.e. the (multi-annual) variations around the mean. For emerging diseases this is obviously not practical and estimation methods in those cases usually make use of epidemic growth curves instead. However, these also implicitly assume exponential vector age profiles and are therefore subject to inflation. In order to account for this we have here derived a correction factor that can be applied to classical R0 estimation formulas and which adjusts for most of the discrepancy between the vector-to-human transmission period (VHTP) of the biological system and the assumed system with constant vector mortality.",

However, these methods can still suffer from the same issues as simpler ODE models, where transition rates between life and infection stages are usually exponentially distributed and where information about individual ages is lost at every transition stage. The ease at which different distributions that govern host and vector mortality, infection recovery and other epidemiological factors can be incorporated, make IBM frameworks the natural choice to examine the influence of vector mortality or other such factors on R0 estimations. Here we only concentrated on the effect of vector mortality, whereas similar arguments are equally valid for the distribution underlying the extrinsic incubation period [34], for example. Nevertheless, our work strongly suggests that vector mortality rates, or rather our assumptions about the age-dependency of survivorship, are the predominant factors, as our correction term for R0 estimates based on epidemic growth essentially recovers the true value.",

Although the assumption of age-dependent mortality rates generally prevented extremely high values of secondary cases, and therefore R0, the variance was still in the region of twice the mean and included a significant proportion of zero cases. That is, in around a third of the simulations we observed no secondary case at all despite starting off with the same initial conditions. This then begs the question whether these events should be counted towards the estimated R0 or not, as in reality we never observe such failed introductions. Comparing the expected with the observed R0 value would suggest that zero cases should be counted, which on the other hand implies that even high values of the reproduction number are by no means a guarantee that an outbreak should ensue if a disease gets introduced in a fully susceptible population (sufficient conditions to prevent stochastic fade-out at the start of an epidemic have been previously discussed [35]). The high variation also suggests that control strategies based on R0 estimates generated from initial growth rates should be treated with caution and that estimations based on one particular setting might not be adequate to generalize and predict pathogen behaviour across all other spatial contexts [36].",

The original Ross-MacDonald model for the spread of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria assumed constant vector mortality as laboratory and field studies seemed to suggest that death rates were age independent [42]. However, re-analysis of laboratory data showed that mosquito mortality is in fact age-dependent for several Anopholes species [43]. More recent studies also confirmed that mosquito mortality is dependent on age for Anopheles mosquitoes [27] and Aedes aegypti [24, 25]. What is clear is that more work needs to be done to fully elucidate realistic, i.e. field-relevant vector mortality rates, perhaps with more accurate spectroscopic methods [44], as well as their environmental drivers. That is, seasonal variations in temperature and rainfall have been shown to affect the birth and death rate of vectors [45\u201348], the vectorial competence [49] as well as the extrinsic incubation period [50\u201353]. It has also been emphasized that other spatio-temporal heterogeneities, such as community structures and host and vector movement, should be considered when assessing R0 [54, 55]. All this needs to be factored in if we are to develop better models to understand the epidemiological and ecological determinants of vector-borne diseases, guide outbreak prevention strategies or monitor ongoing intervention measures.",

Note that corrected values of R0\u03bb, R^0\u03bb, can yield good estimates but are still subject to significant variations around the mean. Results are based on 100 model runs for each scenario; the inserted boxplots indicate the median and interquartile ranges, and the dashed line denotes the theoretical R0 value.",
