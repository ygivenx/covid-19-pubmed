First, the serial interval (SI) describes the mean time between illness onset of two successive cases in the chain of transmission. Second, the secondary attack rate (SAR) describes the proportion of susceptible contacts that acquire infection from an infectious person. Third, the basic reproductive number (R0) is defined as the average number of secondary cases per primary case in an idealised entirely susceptible population in the absence of control measures. Finally, the effective reproductive number (Rt) at any given time point represents the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case observed in a population. Rt reflects the impact of control measures and the depletion of susceptible persons over time. The initial Rt may approximate R0 in pandemic situations. [2]\u2013[5].",

In this work we incorporate data collected on all laboratory-confirmed cases detected during the 2009 pH1N1 epidemic in South Africa with the aim of describing the transmissibility characteristics (initial Rt and temporal variation of Rt) of the epidemic in the country and compare its dynamics with those observed in other countries in the same year.",

The covariates assessed in the model were patient age, gender, province, date of specimen collection, and collection of a specimen on a weekend day (i.e. Saturday or Sunday). Secondly we obtained an estimated lag-time for each observation with missing date of symptoms onset using a random sampling process from a Poisson distribution centred on the predicted value from the Poisson regression model. A Poisson distribution was selected to model count data. Thirdly we imputed missing dates of symptoms onset by subtracting the estimated lag-time from the date of specimen collection. The imputation process was repeated 100 times for each missing value, creating 100 datasets with information on the onset date (imputed or observed) for 12,630 laboratory-confirmed cases.",

The Ni are assumed to be composed of a mixture of cases that were generated by the previous k days, where k is the maximal value of the serial interval. We denote these as Xj, the number of cases that appear on day i that were infected by individuals with onset of symptoms on day j. We assume that the number of infectees generated by infectors with symptoms on day j follows a Poisson distribution with parameter RtNj. Additionally, Xj = (Xj,j+1, Xj,j+2\u2026,Xj,j+k+1), the vector of cases infected by the Nj individuals, follows a multinomial distribution with parameters p, k and Xj.

Our results focus primarily on the use of analytical techniques to estimate initial Rt and SI without incorporating contact tracing or household transmission studies. However, when parameters from field studies are available, we show that these can be incorporated to provide robust estimates of transmission parameters. We found that initial Rt estimates established using the likelihood-based method for the simultaneous estimation of Rt and SI (method 1: initial : 1.47, SI: 2.78 days) are in agreement with those obtained using SI observed in field investigations [22] (method 2: initial : 1.43 and 1.49 using observed SI for laboratory confirmed or laboratory confirmed and suspected cases respectively). In addition, the mean SI estimate obtained with method 1 (2.78 days) is in agreement with field findings (SI: 2.3\u20132.7 days using observed SI for laboratory confirmed or laboratory confirmed and suspected cases respectively). Previous estimates of initial Rt and the mean SI for pH1N1 have ranged between 1.3\u20132.9 and 2.5\u20133.3 days, respectively [2], [6]\u2013[11], [14]\u2013[19]. Our estimates are consistent with these findings, regardless of the method used for the analysis and despite difference in climate, demography and health systems across these countries. It appears that once established, the transmission characteristics of pH1N1 are very consistent. Differences in transmission rates may occur within smaller subgroups of the overall population; however, this has not been well-studied.",

However, by showing variation in transmissibility with time, we demonstrate that shortly after introduction of pH1N1 into the country, transmission of the virus reached an  of 2.9, resulting in exponential growth of the local epidemic and widespread illness. Nonetheless, we show that after a period of less than 2 months of heightened transmission,  dropped below 1, corresponding to a decline in the incidence of new cases; likely a result of a combination of herd immunity, public health infection control measures and climate impact on virus transmission.",

It has been shown previously that, if cases are not reported, this may bias estimates generated using this method [39]. If the proportion of cases reported remains consistent over the study, then the estimates of transmissibility will not be biased; however, if the reporting fraction varies through time, then biased estimates of the reproductive number and serial interval may result. Likewise, variation in case ascertainment with time may bias our estimates of the temporal variation of Rt. Generally higher reporting rates may be anticipated in the early phase, with reporting fatigue later becoming a factor. Secondly, data for this study are derived from laboratory-based surveillance data from several regions across South Africa; a large and diverse country. Our findings do not incorporate heterogeneities (such as spatial and demographic differences) that likely exist in transmission patterns, or assess the degree to which these impact aggregate measures of initial Rt. Methodologies that incorporate heterogeneities inherent in public health data warrant further study.",

It remains important that revised parameters, from complete datasets and diverse geographies, are incorporated into planning mitigation strategies for future pandemics. Nonetheless, the methods used in this study would be adaptable to generating real-time estimates during future epidemics. As we continue to build epidemiological capacity in developing nations, including South Africa, we must keep in mind the need for rapid assessments of transmissibility of novel pathogens, in addition to disease severity, to better inform public health interventions.",
