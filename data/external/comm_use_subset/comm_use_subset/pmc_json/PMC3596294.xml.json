            "text": "The nucleolus is a dynamic structure that disassembles and reforms during each cell cycle around the rRNA gene clusters [1]. Nucleolus is a major nuclear substructure that coordinates many cellular activities including ribosomal production [2], cell cycle control [3], DNA damage repair [4] and tRNA processing [5]. In order to get into the nucleus, nucleolar proteins must be targeted to the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) [6]. Small molecules can move freely from the cytoplasm through the NPC, but transport of proteins larger than 40 kDa is mediated by specific amino acid sequences, referred as nuclear localization signal (NLS) [7], [8]. A classic NLS contains a cluster of basic amino acids, typically composed of lysines (K) or arginines (R), organized in either a single stretch, the monopartite NLS ((K/R)4\u20136), or in two stretches, the bipartite NLS, where two small clusters are separated by a few amino acids ((K/R)2X10-12(K/R)3) [9]. Unlike the nucleus, the nucleolus is a membrane-free nuclear structure. Nucleolar localization of proteins is mediated typically by functional interaction with nucleolar core components, such as ribosomal DNA, RNA and proteins, yet in most of the cases depends on nucleolar localization sequences (NoLSs) [10]. These kinds of signals have been found in cellular and in viral nucleolar proteins [11]. NoLSs and NLSs have very similar amino acid compositions (a high prevalence of basic residues in both cases) and in some proteins the same region can both target proteins across the nuclear envelope and cause proteins to accumulate in the nucleolus (for example, UTP20 is reported to contain overlapping NLS and NoLS near its C-terminus) [12]. However, in others proteins the NoLS cause proteins to accumulate in the nucleolus but are unable to mediate nuclear envelop translocation. In these cases the proteins usually also contain a NLS (for instance, PPP1R11 contain two different signals: a NoLS-only signal and a NLS-only signal [8]. Because the nucleolus is not a membrane-bound structure, it is presumed that nucleolar accumulation occurs via interaction with already-established nucleolar components. Therefore, members of a subset of the nucleolar proteome act as building blocks of the nucleolus around rDNA genes, and it is formed in an incremental manner [13]. Consequently, many nucleolar proteins may accumulate in a steady-state compartment mediated by NoLS (i.e. a sequence or domain) which might interact with local high-affinity binding sites [14].",

This protein is widely distributed in human tissues, with significantly higher expression levels in heart and skeletal muscle [35]. In addition, NOA36 has been highly conserved during evolution, and is present in many animals, from cnidarians to humans [35]. NOA36 is localized in the nucleoli and the mitochondria of mammalian cells [35]\u2013[36]. We have recently demonstrated that mitochondrial NOA36 is released to the cytosol during apoptosis and becomes part of the cellular apoptotic machinery [36]. Despite the fact that a significant fraction of NOA36 has nucleolar localization, it still remains to be determined how the protein is delivered to and incorporated into the nucleolus. Localization of NOA36 in the nucleolus is RNA-dependent, since treatment of CHO cells with RNAses causes no nucleolar distribution, while treatment with DNAses does not change this localization [37]. Interestingly, NOA36 has been identified as a tyrosine kinase target in Jurkat cells [38].",

PCR products incorporated EcoRI and the BamHI sites on the products ends. A truncated fusion protein containing amino acids 1\u201333 of NOA36 was also expressed as eGFP fusion protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on this p1-33-NOA-eGFP truncated protein to generate deletion of several amino acids, or alternatively, to convert a basic amino acid to a neutral amino acid. The sequence data for the mutagenic oligonucleotides are shown in Table S1. The entire coding region of the yeast exopolyphosphatase, scPPX1, was obtained from the plasmid pTrcPPX1 [41], which was kindly provided by the late Prof. Arthur Kornberg, Stanford University School of Medicine (Stanford, CA). Coding sequences for scPPX1 and for the residues 1\u201333 of NOA36 were ligated to a vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) that had previously been modified to contain a Flag epitope. The sequence for the resultant recombinant protein, Flag-1-33-NOA36-scPPX1, was further subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, Mountainview, CA). As a control, the coding sequence of scPPX1 was fused directly with the Flag tag and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP. Constructs were verified by sequencing (Servicio Central de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda, University of Cadiz). Sequences of oligonucleotides and mutagenesis primers are available on request.",

These constructs were analyzed in transient transfection assays in HeLa cells to determine the subcellular localization of the fusion proteins. Out of the three constructs tested, only the basic rich amino terminal peptide was capable of transporting eGFP to the nucleolus (Fig. 2). The cysteine-rich domain was distributed all over the cell, and the polyacidic carboxy terminal showed only a cytoplasmic localization. This cytoplasmic localization was similar to that found in the assays with the full-length protein fused to eGFP (Fig. 2A). To confirm that it is the amino terminal that is responsible for NOA36 nucleolar localization, we fused the Flag epitope to the amino terminus of a NOA36 truncated protein in which the amino acids 2 to 33 had been deleted. HeLa cells transiently transfected with this construct showed nuclear but not nucleolar staining of the Flag epitope, which was verified by the absence of colocalization with the nucleolar marker UBF in all the interphase transfected cells (Fig. 2C). Besides the nuclear staining, the 13.6% of the transfectants, also showed a diffuse or punctuated cytoplasmic pattern similar to that observed in the Flag-NOA36 fusion protein. These results demonstrated that the amino terminal sequence of NOA36 is the determinant for its nucleolar localization. Western blots analysis of the different truncated fusion proteins with an anti-eGFP antibody (Fig. 2B) or an anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 2D) confirmed that the full length proteins were expressed (Fig. 2B and 2D).",

The analysis of this sequence with Prosite software predicted the existence of a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) between amino acids 3\u201320 [35]. The alignment of the NLS of human NOA36 with other NOA36 sequences from phyla as distant from each other as cnidarians and mammals reveals a remarkable degree of conservation, showing an identity of 66.6% (Fig. 3A). This peptide contains two clusters of three basic amino acids as well as other residues conserved in all the analyzed NOA36 protein sequences. The consensus sequence in the 20 first amino acids is M-P-K-K-K-S/T-G-A/Q-R-K-K-A-E-N/S/K-R/Q-R/K/N-E/V-R/I-X-K. However, other basic amino acids are present in the sequence 21 to 33 that could be significant for the nucleolar localization. In order to characterize the ability of the NOA36 amino terminal sequence to direct eGFP to the nucleolus in different species, we studied the localization of the recombinant protein 1\u201333NOA-eGFP by fluorescence microscopy in transient transfected cell cultures from different cell types and species. Our results showed that this peptide is sufficient to direct eGFP to the nucleolus in all the interphase cells in two different human cell lines, HeLa (fig. 2C) and PC3 (Fig. 3B), and in hamster CHO cells (data not shown). We found that this NoLS has been highly conserved during evolution, since fish and insect cells transfected with this construct also show nucleolar staining (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the high degree of conservation presented by this peptide over the course of evolution.",

We therefore decided to study the effect of deleting each of these clusters in turn (constructs (\u03943\u20135) and (m9\u039410\u201313)). The analysis of the quantification of these constructs revealed that only the cluster of three lysine residues in positions 3\u20135 was essential for maintaining the NoLS, since the deletion of these three lysine residues provoked a nuclear distribution of eGFP very similar to that of the empty vector (nucleolus/nucleus ratio = 1.5). This effect was confirmed by a mutant in which these three basic amino acids were changed to neutral amino acids (nucleolus/nucleus ratio = 2.2). The elimination of the second cluster (amino acids 9\u201311), however, did not show statistically significant differences in fluorescence intensity with respect to the wild type peptide, although it did show a lower nucleolus/nucleus ratio (8.7). Similar results were obtained when an Arg residue was mutated to Ser (m15) in the third cluster (nucleolus/nucleus ratio = 8.1). These data suggest that the main role in the nucleolar localization is played by the first cluster of lysine residues in position 3\u20135, with the other two clusters of basic amino acids playing a minor role. These data also suggest that the first cluster alone might be sufficient to promote nucleolar transport of the eGFP. In order to answer this question, that is, whether this first cluster is in fact the NoLS of NOA36, we fused amino acids 1\u20135 to eGFP (construct (\u03946\u201333)). However, the quantification of the relative fluorescence intensity of this construct revealed that, although the nucleolar localization was slightly higher than in the empty vector (nucleolus/nucleus ratio = 2.2), this short peptide did not retain the capability of transporting the eGFP to the nucleus (nucleus/cytoplasm ratio = 3) (Fig. 4C and D). We also studied the significance of the amino acids not included in the basic amino acids region (amino acids 21 to 33). With this aim, we eliminated this sequence from the reference peptide (construct (\u039421\u201333)). The quantification of fluorescence intensity revealed that there were no statistically significant differences when it was compared with the pN33-eGFP reference construct (nucleolus/nucleus ratio = 9) (Fig. 4C and 4D).",

Although we have previously described the pro-apoptotic role of NOA36 in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, the role played by this protein in the nucleolus has not yet been elucidated. As a basis for this investigation, in this work we have identified the specific amino acid sequence responsible for transporting NOA36 into the nucleolus. This subnuclear structure, the nucleolus, is reformed during each cell cycle and, because it is not isolated by a membrane, proteins do not need a specific transport mechanism in order to penetrate this compartment. Although some efforts have been made in order to characterize and classify NoLs [8], the signal that gives rise to this trans-localization into the nucleolus is difficult to predict and is sometimes contained within or overlapped by the nuclear localization signal [12]. Proteins seem to accumulate in the nucleolus in a steady-state manner and, in this view, there are different mechanisms by which proteins are retained in the nucleolus: there are proteins that bind to rDNA (i.e. with DNA binding motifs) [49] or to rRNA (i.e. containing RNA binding motifs) [19]. Other proteins are anchored to the nucleolus by binding to one of those mentioned above. Some of these proteins (hub proteins) are able to interact with several others that incorporate in their sequence one or more NoLSs, and these signals are characteristically rich in basic amino acids [50], [51]. Finally, other proteins may be located in this subnuclear structure by interacting with other nucleolar proteins in a non-predictable manner. In this work, we have found that NOA36 is transported to and localized in the nucleolus as the result of a specific peptide signal, therefore this protein probably interacts with a RNA binding protein, since the nucleolar localization of NOA36 depends on RNA but not on DNA [37].",

We recently have described the nucleolar localization of polyphosphate in eukaryotic cells, which is associated with nucleolar transcription by modulating the RNA Pol I activity [39].

This would indicate that the amino terminal sequence of NOA36 could be a joint NoLS-NLS region. On the other hand, the full length NOA36-eGFP fusion protein (63.7 kDa) normally localizes in the cytoplasm of HeLa and CHO cells, although shows also nucleolar localization in a small fraction (less than 1%) of CHO transfected cells [35].

In this sense we found that, besides the NoLS, NOA36 could contain a cytoplasmic retention signal located at the carboxy terminus. This fact can be deduced from the localization of the truncated protein 240\u2013310 fused to eGFP. This 36.9 kDa fusion protein should passively diffuse across the nuclear pore complex and enter the nucleus. However, it does not seem to accumulate in the nucleus and it shows mainly cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2A). Cytoplasmic retention signals (CRS) or cytoplasmic localization signals (CLS) have been previously reported in several human proteins, like Cycline B2 [53], the HIV-1 Host Defense Factor APOBEC3G [54] and PTEN [55]. Nevertheless endogenous NOA36 is not a cytosolic, but a mitochondrial protein. However, the characterization of the signal responsible of NOA36 mitcochondrial localization remain elusive in our hands, basically, due to the fact the reporters we have used so far (eGFP, RFP, mCherry and Flag) seem to interfere with the mitochondrial localization of the protein. In the case of the Flag-NOA36 construct, the protein localizes at the nucleoli, although can be also detected in the cytoplasm of the 12.5% of transfected cells in a diffuse or punctuated pattern (Fig. 1D). On the other hand when the NoLS is removed from NOA36 (construct Flag-34C), the recombinant protein shows a nuclear but not nucleolar localization (Fig. 2C), which would suggest the presence of an additional nuclear localization signal within this truncated protein. Further investigations will be required to clarify the role of additional intracellular transport signals in NOA36.",
