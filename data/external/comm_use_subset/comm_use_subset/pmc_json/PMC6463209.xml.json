One group of mechanisms operates in a cell\u2010intrinsic fashion, targeting viral nucleic acids and viral proteins for destruction and/or causing the premature shutdown or demise of infected cells to prevent them from serving as virus producers. Cell\u2010intrinsic antiviral mechanisms are part of the innate immune system and include RNA interference (RNAi) and the interferon (IFN) system. The two systems operate very differently even though they can both be triggered by virally derived long double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) or highly base\u2010paired single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA). DsRNA can derive from the viral genome (in the case of a dsRNA virus) or from annealing of two strands of complementary RNAs, which are generated as RNA virus replication intermediates or DNA virus convergent transcripts. Highly based\u2010paired ssRNAs are found in hairpins within viral genomes or viral transcripts and are generically referred to as dsRNA, a nomenclature that we retain here even if technically incorrect. Both types of dsRNA are largely absent from uninfected cells and act as hallmarks of viral infection to trigger innate antiviral immune responses.",

            "text": "In RNAi, long dsRNA is cleaved by the type III endoribonuclease Dicer into small interfering RNA (siRNAs) (Bernstein et al,\n2001), RNA duplexes of 21\u201324 nucleotides (nts) in length, with 3\u2032 2\u2010nt overhangs and a 5\u2032 mono\u2010phosphate and a 3\u2032 hydroxyl group on both strands (Fig 1) (Hamilton & Baulcombe, 1999; Zamore et al,\n2000; Elbashir et al,\n2001b,a). One strand of each siRNA duplex is bound by an Argonaute (Ago) protein, which, together with accessory proteins, forms the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC) and mediates the endonucleolytic cleavage (\u201cslicing\u201d) of complementary target RNAs (Hammond et al,\n2000; MacRae et al,\n2008). Of the four Ago proteins encoded by the mammalian genome, only Ago2 has catalytic activity and is essential for target slicing and RNAi (Liu et al,\n2004; Meister et al,\n2004; Swarts et al,\n2014; Sheu\u2010Gruttadauria & MacRae, 2017). However, all four Ago proteins are involved in an RNAi\u2010related process, the microRNA (miRNA)\u2010mediated gene silencing pathway, which does not involve slicing but translation inhibition and/or mRNA degradation (Bartel, 2009; Jonas & Izaurralde, 2015). Notably, Dicer is also involved in miRNA biogenesis. Vertebrates and nematodes possess a single Dicer that generates both siRNA and miRNAs while most invertebrates express two Dicer proteins. For example, in Drosophila melanogaster, dmDcr\u20101 is dedicated to the miRNA pathway while dmDcr\u20102 performs antiviral RNAi (Lee et al,\n2004).",

First, viral infections in these organisms lead to the accumulation of Dicer\u2010dependent virus\u2010derived siRNAs (viRNAs) that originate from dsRNA viral replication intermediates and/or RNA hairpins and are homologous to viral RNA sequences (Yoo et al,\n2004; Molnar et al,\n2005; Galiana\u2010Arnoux et al,\n2006; Ho et al,\n2006; van Rij et al,\n2006; Wang et al,\n2006a; Aliyari et al,\n2008; F\u00e9lix et al,\n2011). Second, inactivation of key components of the RNAi pathway results in an increase in viral load in infected cells (Mourrain et al,\n2000; Dalmay et al,\n2001; Li et al,\n2002; Lu et al,\n2005; Schott et al,\n2005; Wilkins et al,\n2005; Deleris et al,\n2006; Galiana\u2010Arnoux et al,\n2006; Wang et al,\n2006a; F\u00e9lix et al,\n2011). Third, many plant and insect viruses encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) that interfere with distinct steps of the RNAi pathway, demonstrating the selection pressure imposed by this antiviral system (Pumplin & Voinnet, 2013; Bronkhorst & van Rij, 2014; Csorba et al,\n2015).",

These key antiviral cytokines are then secreted and act in an autocrine and paracrine manner by binding to their cognate receptors, i.e. the ubiquitously expressed IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) and the epithelial cell type\u2010restricted type III IFN receptor (IL\u201028R), which signal to induce hundreds of interferon\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs) (Schneider et al,\n2014). The proteins encoded by these ISGs limit viral replication directly (Schoggins et al,\n2011) and serve to enhance adaptive immune responses to the virus (de Veer et al,\n2001; Iwasaki & Medzhitov, 2010). For example, the dsRNA\u2010dependent protein kinase R (PKR) is activated by cytosolic dsRNA and phosphorylates and inactivates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 \u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), resulting in translational arrest and thwarting the production of both viral and host cell proteins (Pindel & Sadler, 2011). This can ultimately lead to the demise of the infected cell, further undermining the ability of the virus to propagate.",

RIG\u2010I recognises based\u2010paired ds or ssRNA with a di\u2010 or triphosphate (5\u2032PP/5\u2032PPP) at its 5\u2032 extremity (Hornung et al,\n2006; Pichlmair et al,\n2006; Schlee et al,\n2009; Schmidt et al,\n2009; Goubau et al,\n2014), such as found in the genomes of influenza virus, Sendai virus and reovirus (Baum et al,\n2010; Rehwinkel et al,\n2010; Weber et al,\n2013; Goubau et al,\n2014). MDA5 triggers comprise long dsRNAs that accumulate during infection with certain viruses such as picornaviruses and reovirus (Gitlin et al,\n2006; Kato et al,\n2006; Weber et al,\n2006; Pichlmair et al,\n2009; Feng et al,\n2012). RIG\u2010I and MDA5 contain two tandem N\u2010terminal CARDs (caspase activation and recruitment domains) that mediate downstream signalling via the adaptor protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein), leading to activation of the transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 (interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7) and NF\u03ba\u2010B (nuclear factor kappa\u2010light\u2010chain enhancer of activated B cells). These transcription factors drive the expression of type I and type III IFNs and can directly induce some ISGs. LGP2 lacks CARDs and is unable to induce signalling via MAVS. It is thought to act by modulating responses by the other RLRs (Bruns & Horvath, 2014; Bruns et al,\n2014; Parisien et al,\n2018).",

In contrast, vertebrates have adopted the IFN system for cell\u2010intrinsic antiviral defence and are thought to have abandoned antiviral RNAi even though they have retained the RNAi machinery and utilise it for miRNA generation and function. Recently, a number of studies have started to question whether the primordial antiviral function of RNAi has truly been abandoned by mammalian cells or whether it can constitute a physiologically relevant antiviral system that complements the IFN pathway. This has become an area of controversy, with some investigators suggesting that RNAi can be a relevant means of cell\u2010intrinsic restriction to virus infection in mammals while others argue that it is an epiphenomenon with no role in antiviral resistance (Cullen et al,\n2013; Cullen, 2014; Ding & Voinnet, 2014; tenOever, 2014, 2017; Jeffrey et al,\n2017). In this review, we address this controversy and summarise current understanding of antiviral RNAi pathways in mammals and reflect on the possible contexts in which it might play a role.",

Therefore, we first discuss studies that use synthetic long dsRNA, composed of two perfectly complementary strands, to trigger RNAi, termed here long dsRNA\u2010mediated RNAi (dsRNAi). This process depends on the successive processing of long dsRNA into a pool of siRNAs and is distinct from RNAi induced experimentally by the introduction of siRNAs (which bypasses the Dicer machinery) (Caplen et al,\n2001; Elbashir et al,\n2001a) or of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs, which resemble the structure of pre\u2010miRNAs) (Brummelkamp et al,\n2002; Paddison et al,\n2002b; Bartel, 2004).",

In mammalian cell lines, long dsRNA had either no effect or displayed a non\u2010sequence\u2010specific effect, consistent with activation of the IFN system (Caplen et al,\n2000; Elbashir et al,\n2001a). Yet, in preimplantation embryos, as well as in oocytes, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines, the introduction of long dsRNA targeting endogenous genes caused a specific reduction in gene expression and induction of phenotypes comparable to those of null mutants, without causing cell death or translational arrest (Svoboda et al,\n2000; Wianny & Zernicka\u2010Goetz, 2000; Billy et al,\n2001; Yang et al,\n2001; Paddison et al,\n2002a). The sequence\u2010specific silencing induced by long dsRNA in oocytes and ESCs/ECs correlated with a relative inability of these cells to produce and/or respond to IFN (Burke et al,\n1978; Francis & Lehman, 1989; Stein et al,\n2005; D'Angelo et al,\n2016; Wu et al,\n2018), which suggested that dsRNAi might be active in mammalian undifferentiated cells but masked or inhibited by the IFN system in differentiated cells.",

In such cells, introduction of dsRNA resulted in Dicer\u2010dependent accumulation of siRNAs and Ago2\u2010dependent sequence\u2010specific gene silencing (Maillard et al,\n2016). A subsequent study showed that the IFN system actively inhibits dsRNAi at least in part through induction of LGP2, which binds Dicer and inhibits processing of long dsRNA into siRNAs (Van der Veen et al,\n2018) (Fig 2). In that study (Van der Veen et al,\n2018), LGP binding to Dicer did not impact the biogenesis of two household miRNAs although LGP2 has also been reported to interact with the Dicer co\u2010factor TRBP (HIV TAR RNA\u2010binding protein) and inhibit the processing of a subset of TRBP\u2010bound miRNAs (Komuro et al,\n2016; Takahashi et al,\n2018).

            "text": "It is unclear why somatic cells should inhibit dsRNAi during an IFN response. A clue may come from the observation that mammalian cells stably expressing Drosophila dcr\u20102 to artificially boost dsRNAi have impaired induction of IFN upon treatment with poly(I:C), a dsRNA analog (Girardi et al,\n2015). Viral infection or treatment with poly(I:C) also induces poly\u2010ADP\u2010ribosylation of Ago2 and other RISC components, which inhibits RISC activity and causes a relief in miRNA\u2010mediated repression of some ISGs (Seo et al,\n2013). Perhaps, inhibition of Dicer and RISC is essential for effective stimulation of the IFN pathway, in part by preventing loss of dsRNA substrates for RLR activation. Preservation of dsRNA in infected cells may also ensure that the activity of antiviral proteins encoded by ISGs is not compromised. For example, PKR requires dsRNA of > 30 nts to dimerise and become active for translational repression (Husain et al,\n2012). Dicer\u2010mediated cleavage of long dsRNA could starve the cell of substrates for PKR activation or, more likely, lead to accumulation of 21\u201322 nt siRNA duplexes that would \u201cquench\u201d PKR monomers, blocking substrate\u2010dependent dimerisation.",

            "text": "DsRNAi in mammalian cells is further influenced by the molecular properties of its central component: Dicer. This large multi\u2010domain enzyme comprises an N\u2010terminal DExD/H helicase domain (containing an ATPase site) followed by a small domain of unknown function (DUF283), a Piwi Argonaute Zwille (PAZ) domain, two tandem RNAse III domains and a C\u2010terminal dsRNA\u2010binding domain (dsRBD\u2014Fig 1). The PAZ domain binds the 3\u2032 2nt\u2010overhangs found at the extremity of dsRNA substrates, while the RNAse III domains each mediate the cleavage of one strand of the RNA duplex. In vitro studies revealed that human Dicer (hDcr) processes long dsRNA into siRNAs less efficiently than pre\u2010miRNA into miRNAs (Ma et al,\n2008; Chakravarthy et al,\n2010). Deletion or partial proteolysis of the helicase domain increases rate of dsRNA cleavage, while only modestly affecting the cleavage of pre\u2010miRNAs (Provost et al,\n2002; Zhang et al,\n2002; Ma et al,\n2008). Similarly, a deletion mutant of hDcr lacking nearly the entire helicase domain displayed an enhanced ability to process endogenously transcribed long dsRNA and long hairpin RNAs into siRNAs and conferred dsRNAi activity to engineered cells (Kennedy et al,\n2015). Finally, mouse oocytes, in which dsRNAi is active, express a shortened isoform of Dicer (DicerO) that lacks the N\u2010terminal helicase domain and processes endogenous or ectopically expressed long hairpin RNAs more efficiently (Flemr et al,\n2013). Together, these data suggest that the helicase domain of Dicer inhibits its catalytic activity for long dsRNA and that its incorporation into the mature enzyme might be regulated by alternative transcription. However, expression of DicerO has not been detected outside mouse germ cells and expression of truncated Dicer isoforms in humans has been reported only in certain cancer cell lines (Potenza et al,\n2010; Hinkal et al,\n2011; Cantini et al,\n2014). An alternative possibility is that modulation of inhibition by the helicase domain could come about not through alternative transcription but through the activity of Dicer\u2010associated proteins. Structural studies show that the co\u2010factors TRBP and PACT (Protein Activator of PKR) induce a conformational change in the Dicer helicase domain (Taylor et al,\n2013) that could mimic the effect of deletion (Lee et al,\n2006; Ma et al,\n2008; Chakravarthy et al,\n2010; Ota et al,\n2013). The exact role and cellular context in which TRBP and PACT might modulate the ability of Dicer to process long dsRNA in vivo remains to be explored.",

RNA viruses engineered to contain perfectly complementary target sites for cellular miRNAs are restricted in cells or tissues expressing the cognate miRNAs (Cawood et al,\n2009; Perez et al,\n2009; Kelly et al,\n2010; Langlois et al,\n2013). Finally, in IFN\u2010defective somatic cells, introduction of long dsRNA conferred sequence\u2010specific protection from viral challenge dependent on the \u201cslicing\u201d activity of Ago2 (Maillard et al,\n2016). Together, these studies show that, if siRNAs are provided directly (bypassing Dicer processing) or are generated from substrates in the absence of an IFN response (shRNAs or dsRNAs in IFN\u2010defective cells), RISC can access and target viral RNAs to limit viral accumulation. As such, much of the current debate on the role of antiviral RNAi in mammalian cells ultimately centres on the question of whether, during a viral infection, viRNAs are ever produced in sufficient amounts to engage the latent antiviral activity of RISC and exert an antiviral effect.",

Initial attempts failed to detect viRNAs in mammalian cells infected with viruses (Pfeffer et al,\n2005; Lin & Cullen, 2007), yet the recent emergence of high\u2010throughput sequencing has allowed the question to be re\u2010explored more thoroughly. Deep sequencing of differentiated mammalian cells infected with five mammalian viruses [HCV, dengue virus (DENV), WNV, poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)] revealed the presence of small RNAs derived from the viral genome (viral small RNAs or vsRNAs) (Parameswaran et al,\n2010). These vsRNAs, however, did not display size uniformity except in cells carrying a HCV replicon or infected with HCV virions (Parameswaran et al,\n2010). Additional deep sequencing experiments of human cells infected with a range of viruses [WNV, DENV, Borna disease virus, IAV, Sindbis virus (SINV)] also reported the detection of vsRNAs but not specifically 22 nt long ones (Girardi et al,\n2013; Backes et al,\n2014; Bogerd et al,\n2014). In addition, deep sequencing of RIG\u2010I\u2010 and MDA5\u2010deficient cells infected with SINV, YFV and the picornavirus coxsackie virus B3 did not reveal viRNA accumulation (Schuster et al,\n2017) [although the inhibition of Dicer activity by LGP2 might have dampened the response (Van der Veen et al,\n2018)]. Altogether, these experiments argue for limited Dicer\u2010mediated generation of viRNAs in IFN\u2010competent differentiated somatic cells.",

The sequences formed perfectly paired duplexes with 3\u2032 2\u2010nt overhangs and were produced in a phase pattern indicative of successive cleavage by Dicer. Finally, the duplexes could be shown to associate with Ago2 and require Dicer for their generation, thereby fulfilling all criteria for bona fide viRNAs (Maillard et al,\n2013). Interestingly, production of these viRNAs by mESCs was greatly reduced upon cell differentiation (Maillard et al,\n2013), in line with the aforementioned studies reporting little viRNA generation in differentiated somatic cells.",

            "text": "Thus, in some IFN\u2010deficient cells, including ESCs, infection with viruses allows for viRNA production. Can it elicit a protective RNAi\u2010dependent response? Early work suggested that knockdown of Dicer in Vero cells, an African green monkey cell line that lacks IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 genes (Diaz et al,\n1988), causes a modest increase in virus production upon IAV infection (Matskevich & Moelling, 2007). In contrast, later reports found that absence of Dicer in HEK 293T cells and/or in mouse embryonic fibroblasts did not impact the accumulation of flaviviruses (DENV, WNV, YFV), alphaviruses (SINV, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [VEEV]), IAV, measles virus, HIV and reovirus (Shapiro et al,\n2010; Bogerd et al,\n2014). Similarly, in engineered cells overexpressing an artificial Dicer that lacks the helicase domain, infection with IAV or poliovirus led to low\u2010level accumulation of viRNAs, which were loaded onto RISC but had little impact on replication (Kennedy et al,\n2015). Finally, expression of a slicing\u2010deficient Ago2 mutant in Ifnar1\n\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts did not impact infection with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), reovirus or IAV (Maillard et al,\n2016). The overall message from those studies is that, even in a context permissive for dsRNAi, viRNA production from viral replication intermediates is too weak to inhibit viral infection. Replication of (+)\u2010sense RNA viruses often occurs within membranous structures (replication factories), whereas RNAs generated during replication of (\u2212)\u2010sense RNA viruses rapidly associate with nucleocapsid proteins (Conzelmann, 1998; Romero\u2010Brey & Bartenschlager, 2014). In addition, the 5\u2032 extremities of certain viral genomes (and replication intermediates) can display various modifications, including a 7\u2010methylguanosine (Cap) structure, a covalently linked protein (e.g. Vpg, viral protein genome\u2010linked), highly structured regions or 2\u20133 phosphates (Fig 2). Whether these features prevent efficient access of Dicer to viral RNA is unknown although it is worth remembering they do not prevent antiviral RNAi in insect cells. A key issue might therefore be antagonism of RNAi by VSRs. This will be discussed in the next section.",

Expression of influenza virus NS1, vaccinia virus E3L, reovirus \u03c33 and Nodamura virus (NoV) B2 proteins inhibits RNAi in plants and/or insect cells (Lichner et al,\n2003; Bucher et al,\n2004; Delgadillo et al,\n2004; Li et al,\n2004). In mammalian cells, a plethora of mammalian virus\u2010encoded VSRs, including primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV\u20101) Tas, NoV B2, HCV core, IAV NS1, HIV Tat, Ebola VP35, VP30 and VP40, CoV N, SARS\u2010CoV 7a, YFV capsid, DENV NS4B, human enterovirus 71 (HEV 71) 3A and adenovirus virus\u2010associated RNA I (VA1), can reduce shRNA/siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of reporter genes (Table 1) (Lu & Cullen, 2004; Andersson et al,\n2005; Lecellier et al,\n2005; Sullivan & Ganem, 2005; Wang et al,\n2006b; Haasnoot et al,\n2007; Chen et al,\n2008; de Vries et al,\n2009; Karjee et al,\n2010; Fabozzi et al,\n2011; Kakumani et al,\n2013; Cui et al,\n2015; Samuel et al,\n2016; Qiu et al,\n2017). Most viral proteins identified thus far that display VSR activity share the ability to bind dsRNA and mutations that affect their dsRNA\u2010binding domain block VSR activity, arguing that their principal mode of action is sequestration of dsRNA from Dicer (Table 1). As dsRNA is a potent inducer of the IFN pathway, most of these VSRs also act as IFN antagonists (Garc\u00eda\u2010Sastre, 2017). It is therefore unclear whether these viral proteins specifically evolved to block RNAi or whether their VSR activity is a byproduct of their role as IFN antagonists (Cullen, 2006). However, some VSRs may function through mechanisms other than dsRNA sequestration (Kakumani et al,\n2013), including binding to components of the RNAi pathway: e.g. Ebola virus VP35 and VP30 proteins interact with Dicer co\u2010factors TRBP and PACT, while HCV core associates with Dicer (Table 1) (Wang et al,\n2006b; Chen et al,\n2008; Fabozzi et al,\n2011). Whether these interactions contribute to VSR activity is unclear. Finally, adenovirus VA1s are small, highly structured RNAs that inhibit shRNA\u2010mediated RNAi by acting as decoy substrates for Dicer, RISC and exportin 5 (required for nuclear export of pre\u2010miRNAs and shRNAs) (Lu & Cullen, 2004; Andersson et al,\n2005).",

Persuasive experiments have been done with NoV, a member of the Nodavirus family. Nodaviruses express B2 proteins, which bind long dsRNA and siRNAs in vitro and associate with replication intermediates and viRNAs in infected cells (Chao et al,\n2005; Lu et al,\n2005; Sullivan & Ganem, 2005; Aliyari et al,\n2008). B2 proteins act as potent VSRs in insect cells (Wang et al,\n2006a; Aliyari et al,\n2008). Notably, B2\u2010deficient NoV (NoV \u0394B2) also replicates less efficiently than parental NoV in mESCs but its accumulation is rescued in mESCs lacking all Ago genes (Maillard et al,\n2013). In suckling mice, NoV \u0394B2 is highly attenuated and induces accumulation of viRNAs (Li et al,\n2013). viRNAs are also detected, although to a lesser degree, upon infection of somatic cells (BHK\u201021) with NoV \u0394B2, but not with NoV WT (Li et al,\n2013). Altogether, these data suggest that the ability of Dicer to process NoV replication intermediates is actively antagonised by the B2 protein.",

It has been reported that IAV \u0394NS1, and to a lesser extent parental wild\u2010type IAV, VSV and EMCV, replicates more extensively in mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing a slicing\u2010deficient Ago2 mutant (Li et al,\n2016). However, in other studies, loss of RNAi components did not cause an increase in replication of IAV \u0394NS1 (Maillard et al,\n2016; Tsai et al,\n2018). Interestingly, IAV engineered to express an shRNA or a miRNA targeting a viral gene or a reporter gene integrated in the viral genome, respectively, was attenuated compared to non\u2010targeting controls (Benitez et al,\n2015). This restriction was Dicer\u2010dependent but independent of NS1 suggesting that, in the context of an infection, NS1\u2032s VSR activity inhibits viRNA production from genome segments but not from short dsRNA hairpins (Benitez et al,\n2015; Li et al,\n2016; Tsai et al,\n2018).",

A point mutation that inactivates 3A's VSR activity reduces viral replication in somatic cells and in suckling mice. Concomitantly, canonical viRNAs derived from both strands of the 5\u2032terminal region of the HEV71 genome are produced, loaded into RISC and able to silence a reporter bearing complementary sites (Qiu et al,\n2017).

One of those niches might be stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells do not produce IFN upon viral infection or exposure to poly(I:C) and respond poorly to IFN treatment (Chen et al,\n2010; Hong & Carmichael, 2013; Wang et al,\n2013; Guo et al,\n2015; D'Angelo et al,\n2016). It is unclear why pluripotent stem cells are refractory to IFN but it may have to do with the fact that self\u2010renewal is incompatible with the anti\u2010proliferative effects and pro\u2010apoptotic effects of the cytokines (Hertzog et al,\n1994; de Veer et al,\n2001). Furthermore, artificial induction of an IFN response in engineered pluripotent cells compromises differentiation potential (Eggenberger et al,\n2019). Thus, pluripotent stem cells may be forced to rely on IFN\u2010independent mechanisms to combat virus infections. These may include the ability to constitutively express some ISGs that confer an efficient and permanent antiviral state (Wu et al,\n2018). In this scenario, antiviral RNAi would constitute an additional mechanism to protect the integrity and function of tissue stem cells in the face of virus infection and thereby contribute to tissue maintenance, repair and regeneration (Xia et al,\n2018). Notably, the ability of a virus to infect stem cells might not be needed for its propagation and, therefore, stem cell\u2010intrinsic antiviral RNAi would benefit the host but not impact on virus transmission.",
