The guided discussion technique4 aimed to elicit dialogue and exchanges between the assessors and participants, to review procedures and interdepartmental interactions and to analyse the functionality of the health emergency systems. Discussions continued with technical leaders during visits to specific settings: the country\u2019s major international airport and its Ebola virus disease reference hospital and reference laboratory (1 day). We dedicated a half day to train the joint assessment team members and another half day to present preliminary findings to the same audience for clarification and to reach consensus (1 day). The final results and recommendations were summarized in the form of a report and presented to the health authorities of the country on the last day of the visit (1 day). WHO committed to monitoring the implementation of the recommendations. ",

Readiness of a structure that was already in place was assessed on the level of training as follows: low evidence of functionality, when simple training such as a lecture or demonstration was carried out (score 2); or high evidence of functionality, if simulations were conducted regularly and reported to be followed by improvements (score 3). High surge capacity was defined as evidence of surge planning in terms of sufficient enrolment of trained staff and adequate space and supplies.5 Our assessments were based on documented evidence or participants\u2019 descriptions of procedures.",

Of these, most had conducted a risk assessment only once at the early phase of preparedness, rather than as a continuous evaluation, and most relied on the results of the regular WHO global risk assessments in which country-specific recommendations are limited. Only Sri Lanka and Thailand used risk assessment for preparedness by identifying several scenarios of Ebola virus disease to be addressed in the preparedness process.

WHO has recommended that airport staff should identify international travellers exhibiting signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease, or with a history of exposure to Ebola virus, and provide a coordinated response on arrival.6 While some airports were not up to standard or poorly equipped (e.g. without an isolation or holding-area facility), there was close collaboration between the airport authorities and the health authorities in all countries. Mechanisms for sharing information about at-risk travellers between the surveillance department and the health offices at airports were in place and appeared to be functional (task I5). Specific emergency plans for importation of Ebola virus disease or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus were tested by undertaking drills that encompassed detection of a suspected Ebola virus disease case and transfer from the airport to the reference hospital (with whom stand-by arrangements had been made beforehand) (task I1).

Planning was triggered in all countries after WHO declared Ebola virus disease as a public health emergency of international concern in 2014. The Ebola preparedness plans tended to rely on generic structures previously established for influenza pandemics in the countries.7 Effectiveness in implementing Ebola virus disease preparedness can therefore be interpreted as a return on investment in IHR capacities.8 This underscores the fundamental importance of the IHR mechanism for global health security.

Second, findings were based on a broad review of procedures rather than a quality analysis of the documents or direct observations of performance. An overall high level of readiness should be interpreted as indicating that the country is taking steps to ensure that its plan is truly operational and that the planned activities are actionable. Third, our assessment indicators were adapted from the WHO Ebola preparedness checklist,3 but, due to time constraints, have not been formally piloted. The choice of indicators and the scoring system can be debated. For example, due to time constraints we chose not to study preparedness on specific logistics of Ebola virus disease from the WHO checklist.3 Instead we focused on the main pillars of the IHR. Rather than evaluating and comparing countries, our joint WHO and health ministry approach aimed to help countries to prioritize and formally document their most urgent needs to enhance preparedness and response within their health security system. We appreciate that Sri Lanka has made the report publicly available,18 which is one of the goals of the review. We hope that other countries are encouraged to use a similar transparent and constructive process whereby WHO and national participants work together in interactive sessions to reach a consensus with clear justifications. Transparency and consensus were adopted by WHO\u2019s joint external evaluation in 2016 to monitor IHR compliance and help attract and direct resources to where they are needed most.19",
