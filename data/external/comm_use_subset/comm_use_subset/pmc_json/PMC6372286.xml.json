            "text": "Ultrastructural studies have reported the origin, nature, and extent of membrane modifications induced by coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae), which materialize as an ER-derived network of interconnected double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CM) in perinuclear regions of infected cells to which the viral replication/transcription complex (RTC) is anchored (Knoops et al., 2008; Ulasli et al., 2010; Oudshoorn et al., 2017). The RTC is generated by translation of the genomic RNA into two large polyproteins that are extensively auto-proteolytically processed by viral proteases to give rise to 16 processing end-products, termed non-structural proteins (nsps) 1\u201316. Nsp1 is rapidly cleaved from the polyproteins and not considered an integral component of the coronaviral RTC, but interferes with host cell translation by inducing degradation of cellular mRNAs (Huang et al., 2011; Z\u00fcst et al., 2007; Lokugamage et al., 2015). Although it has not yet been formally demonstrated, the remaining nsps (nsp2-16) are thought to comprise the RTC and harbor multiple enzymes and functions, such as de-ubiquitination, proteases, helicase, polymerase, exo- and endonuclease, and N7- and 2\u2019O-methyltransferases (Thiel et al., 2003; Snijder et al., 2003; Decroly et al., 2008; Barretto et al., 2005; Lindner et al., 2005; Athmer et al., 2017). Many of these functions have been studied using reverse genetic approaches, which revealed their importance in virus-host interactions (Kindler et al., 2017; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011; Eckerle et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015). In most cases, phenotypes were described via loss-of-function mutagenesis. However, in the context of virus infection, the specific interactions of RTC components with host cell factors remain largely unknown.",

Likewise, genome-wide CRISPR-based screens have been applied to other positive-stranded RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, and identified critical host proteins required for replication (Marceau et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). Some of these proteins were described in the context of distinct ER processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), and signal peptide insertion and processing. Although individual proteins identified by these screens may interact with viral replication complexes, they likely constitute only a small fraction of the global replicase microenvironment.",

BirAR118G biotinylates proximal (<10 nm) proteins in live cells without disrupting intracellular membranes or protein complexes, and hence, does not rely on high-affinity protein-protein interactions but is also able to permanently tag transient interactions (Roux et al., 2012). Covalent protein biotinylation allows stringent lysis and washing conditions during affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric identification of captured factors. By engineering a recombinant MHV harboring BirAR118G as an integral component of the RTC, we identified >500 host proteins reflecting the molecular microenvironment of MHV replication structures. siRNA-mediated silencing of each of these factors highlighted, amongst others, the functional importance of vesicular ER-Golgi apparatus trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related catabolic processes, and translation initiation factors. Importantly, the detection of active translation in close proximity to the viral RTC highlighted the critical involvement of translation initiation factors during coronavirus replication. Collectively, the determination of the coronavirus RTC-associated microenvironment provides a functional and spatial link between conserved host cell processes and viral RNA synthesis, and highlights potential targets for the development of novel antiviral agents.",

MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 retained the cleavage site between nsp1 and BirAR118G, while a deleted cleavage site between BirAR118G and nsp2 ensured the expression of a BirAR118G-nsp2 fusion protein (Figure 1a). This strategy was chosen because it was recently employed by Freeman et al. for a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with nsp2 and represents the only known site tolerating large insertions within the MHV replicase polyprotein (Freeman et al., 2014). MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 replicated to comparable peak titers and replication kinetics as the parental wild-type MHV-A59 (Figure 1b). MHV-GFP-nsp2, which was constructed in parallel and contained the coding sequence of EGFP (Freeman et al., 2014) instead of BirAR118G, was used as a control and also reached wild-type virus peak titers, with slightly reduced viral titers at 9 hr post- infection (h.p.i.) compared to MHV-A59 and MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 (Figure 1b).",

To further confirm the accommodation of BirAR118G within the viral RTC, MHV-A59-, MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-, and mock-infected L929 fibroblasts were visualized using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. BirAR118G-nsp2 remained strongly associated with the MHV RTC throughout the entire replication cycle, as indicated by the co-localization of BirAR118G-nsp2 with established markers of the MHV replicase, such as nsp2/3 and nsp8 (Figure 1c, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3). This observation corroborates previous studies demonstrating that nsp2, although not required for viral RNA synthesis, co-localizes with other nsps of the coronaviral RTC (Schiller et al., 1998; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Graham et al., 2005). Importantly, by supplementing the culture medium with biotin, we could readily detect biotinylated proteins with fluorophore-coupled streptavidin that appeared close to the MHV RTC throughout the entire replication cycle in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells, demonstrating efficient proximity-dependent biotinylation of RTC-proximal host factors (Figure 1c, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3).",

A characteristic pattern of endogenously biotinylated proteins was observed under all conditions where no exogenous biotin was added to the culture medium (Figure 2b). The same pattern was detectable in non-infected and wild-type MHV-A59-infected cells when the culture medium was supplemented with biotin, suggesting that the addition of biotin in the absence of the BirAR118G biotin ligase does not recognizably change the fraction of endogenously biotinylated proteins. In contrast, we observed a greatly increased fraction of biotinylated proteins in lysates derived from MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells treated with biotin. This result demonstrates that virus-mediated expression of the BirAR118G biotin ligase results in efficient biotinylation when biotin is added to the culture medium. Moreover, we could readily affinity purify, enrich, and recover the fraction of biotinylated proteins under stringent denaturing lysis and washing conditions by using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Figure 2b).",

This is in agreement with studies demonstrating co-localization and interactions amongst individual nsps, and with studies showing association of the nucleocapsid protein with the coronavirus RTC (Ulasli et al., 2010; Denison et al., 1999; Sims et al., 2000; van der Meer et al., 1999; Bost et al., 2001). It also highlights the specificity and effectiveness of the labeling approach in live cells and is the first experimental evidence showing that collectively these viral nsps and the nucleocapsid (N) protein are subunits of the coronavirus RTC. Furthermore, these results corroborate previous reports that nsp1 is likely not an integral component of the coronavirus RTC (Huang et al., 2011; Z\u00fcst et al., 2007; Lokugamage et al., 2015; Denison et al., 1992). Amongst the \u2018not detected\u2019 or \u2018not enriched\u2019 viral proteins are (i) nsp11, which is a short peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned role or function in coronavirus replication, (ii) the structural proteins spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, and membrane (M) protein, which mainly localize to sites of viral assembly before being incorporated into newly-formed viral particles, and (iii) all accessory proteins (NS2a, HE, ORF4, ORF5a). Altogether, these results validate the proximity-dependent biotinylation approach and demonstrate the specific and exclusive labeling of MHV-RTC-associated proteins (Figure 2d).",

Therefore, the identified RTC-proximal host proteins, recorded over the entire duration of the MHV replication cycle, likely include proteins that display a prolonged co-localization with the MHV RTC, proteins that may locate only transiently in close proximity to the RTC, and proteins of which only a minor fraction of the cellular pool may associate with the RTC. To this end, we assessed the localization of a limited number of host proteins from our candidate list in MHV-infected cells. Accordingly, we identified RTC-proximal host proteins displaying a pronounced co-localization with the MHV RTC, such as the ER protein reticulon 4 (RTN4; Figure 2e), and host proteins where co-localization by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was not readily detectable, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3E (eIF3E; Figure 2e). However, in the latter case, a more sensitive detection technique, such as a proximity ligation assay that relies on proximity-dependent antibody-coupled DNA probe amplification (S\u00f6derberg et al., 2006), demonstrated proximity of eIF3E and dsRNA in MHV-infected cells (Figure 2f).",

Cell viability after siRNA knockdown was also assessed and genes resulting in cytotoxicity following silencing were discarded from further analysis. Importantly, we included internal controls of known relevance for MHV entry (MHV receptor Ceacam1a) and replication (Gbf1, Arf1) on each plate and found in each case that siRNA silencing of these factors significantly reduced MHV replication, which underscores the robustness and effectiveness of our approach (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a) (Verheije et al., 2008). We found that siRNA-mediated silencing of 53 RTC-proximal host factors significantly reduced MHV replication compared to non-targeting siRNA controls. These factors can therefore be considered proviral and required for efficient replication (Figure 4b; Supplementary file 3). In contrast, we did not find antiviral factors that resulted in significant enhancement of viral replication upon siRNA knockdown. While this work was performed in a murine fibroblast cell line, the identification of antiviral proteins may be anticipated in a similar siRNA-mediated knockdown screen using primary target cells such as macrophages, that are better equipped in eliciting antiviral responses upon virus infection.",

For this, we selected all host factors assigned to the category \u2018translation\u2019 (Figure 3a) and assessed virus replication following siRNA-mediated silencing of each factor. Measurement of luciferase activity after MHV-Gluc infection confirmed initial findings obtained by screening the entire siRNA library of MHV RTC-proximal factors (Figure 4c). Specifically for Rpl13a, and eIFs 3i, 3 f, and 3e viral replication was reduced to levels comparable to our controls Ceacam1a (MHV receptor) and Gbf1 (Verheije et al., 2008). Consistently, cell-associated viral mRNA levels (Figure 4d) and viral titers (Figure 4e) were reduced upon siRNA silencing of these factors. Although the silencing of a subset of host translation factors severely restricted MHV replication, effective knockdown of these factors (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c) did not affect cell viability (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d) and only moderately affected host cell translation levels (Figure 4f, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1e). This data demonstrates that the reduced viral replication observed after siRNA knockdown is not due to a general impairment of host translation. To confirm the knockdown of host translation factors on the protein level we employed antibodies that were available for eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3i, and as shown in Figure 5, murine L929 fibroblasts that were treated individually with four target-specific siRNAs displayed significantly reduced expression of eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3i proteins (Figure 5a, Figure 5b). Importantly, under conditions of eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3i knockdown, viral replication was also significantly restricted, confirming the importance of these translation initiation factors for MHV replication (Figure 5c).",

In non-infected L929 cells, ribopuromycylation resulted in an expected diffuse, mainly cytosolic, staining pattern interspersed with punctate structures indicative of translation localized to dedicated subcellular cytosolic locations (Figure 6). In striking contrast, MHV-infected L929 cells displayed a pronounced enrichment of actively translating ribosomes near the viral RTC as indicated by the strong overlap between the viral replicase and the ribopuromycylation stain. Interestingly, active translation in vicinity of the RTC was strongest during the early phase of infection at 6 h.p.i., and was observed until 8 h.p.i., before gradually decreasing as the infection advanced along with the appearance of typical syncytia formation indicative of cytopathic effect (CPE).",

The HCoV-229E RTC, which was detected with an antiserum directed against nsp8, appeared as small and dispersed perinuclear puncta during early infection and eventually converged into larger perinuclear structures later in infection. Consistent with findings obtained for MHV, we observed a striking co-localization of the HCoV-229E RTC with sites of active translation during the early phase of the infection (Figure 7, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1). The co-localization gradually decreased as the infection reached the late phase with upcoming signs of CPE. Finally, we further demonstrated that active translation is localized to the site of MERS-CoV RNA synthesis as dsRNA puncta highly overlapped with the ribopuromycylation stain in MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells (Figure 7). Collectively, these results not only confirm the spatial link between individual components of the host cell translation machinery and coronavirus replication compartments as identified by proximity-dependent biotinylation using MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2, but they also demonstrate that active translation is taking place in close proximity to the viral RTC.",

On the ultrastrurctural level, APEX2-catalized DAB polymer depositions were detected at DMVs and CMs, and we observed co-localization of BirAR118G with established coronavirus RTC markers, such as nsp2/3 and nsp8, by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Notably, in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells the detection of biotinylated coronavirus replicase gene products nsp2-10, nsp12-16, and the nucleocapsid protein by mass spectrometry demonstrates that these proteins are in close proximity during infection. This extends previous immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies that were limited by the availability of nsp-specific antibodies and could only show localization of individual nsps to coronavirus replicative structures (Knoops et al., 2008; Ulasli et al., 2010; Schiller et al., 1998; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Graham et al., 2005). Moreover, the close proximity of BirAR118G-nsp2 to MHV replicative enzymes, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the NTPase/helicase (nsp13), the 5\u2019-cap methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16), the proof-reading exonuclease (nsp14), in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells further suggests close proximity of nsp2 to the site of viral RNA synthesis.

            "text": "One novel finding that arose immediately from our RTC-proximity screen is the demonstration of a close spatial association of host cell translation with the coronavirus RTC. Indeed, the biotin ligase-based proteomic screen identified a number of translation initiation factors, most prominently several eIF3 subunits that were found to have functional importance for viral replication, and numerous ribosome- and translation-associated proteins within the coronavirus RTC microenvironment (Figure 3, Figure 4). These results are in line with a recent genome-wide siRNA screen where translation factors were suggested to play a role in the replication of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) (Wong et al., 2015). The implication of this finding has, to our knowledge, not been further investigated. In addition, we noted the presence of subunits of the signal recognition particle in proximity to the coronavirus RTC and their functional relevance for viral replication, which is indicative of an importance for the translation of membrane proteins. Notably, the coronavirus RTC is translated as two polyproteins that contain nsp3, 4 and 6 with multiple trans-membrane domains that are believed to anchor the RTC at ER-derived membranes (Knoops et al., 2008; Oostra et al., 2007). It is thus tempting to speculate that the coronavirus RTC is either attracting, or deliberately forming in proximity to, the ER-localized host translation machinery in order to facilitate replicase translation and insertion into ER membranes. This idea is also applicable to many other positive-stranded RNA viruses that express viral polyproteins with embedded trans-membrane domains to anchor the viral replication complex in host endomembranes. Recent experimental evidence for Dengue virus supports this hypothesis. By using cell fractionation and ribosomal profiling, it has been shown that translation of the Dengue virus (family Flaviviridae) genome is associated with the ER-associated translation machinery accompanied by ER-compartment-specific remodeling of translation (Reid et al., 2018). Moreover, several recent genome-wide CRISPR screens demonstrated the functional importance of proteins involved in biosynthesis of membrane and secretory proteins, further supporting a pivotal role of the ER-associated translation machinery for virus replication (Zhang et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Compartmentalization of cellular translation to sites of viral RNA synthesis has been described for dsRNA viruses of the orthoreovirus family, which replicate and assemble in distinct cytosolic inclusions known as viral factories to which the host translation machinery is recruited (Desmet et al., 2014). The data presented here indicate that coronaviruses have evolved a similar strategy by compartmentalizing and directing viral RNA synthesis to sites of ER-associated translation. Likewise, this strategy has a number of advantages. Coronaviruses would not require sophisticated transport mechanisms that direct viral mRNA to distantly located ribosomes. A close spatial association of viral RNA synthesis and translation during early post-entry events would rather allow for remodeling the ER-associated translation machinery to ensure translation of viral mRNA in a protected microenvironment. Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to facilitate translation of their mRNAs including highly diverse internal ribosomal entry sites, recruitment of translation-associated host factors to viral RNAs, and even transcript-specific translation (Hashem et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013). Accordingly, by remodeling defined sites for viral mRNA translation, the repertoire and concentration of translation factors can be restricted to factors needed for translation of these viral mRNAs. A microenvironment that is tailored towards the translational needs of viral mRNAs in proximity to the viral replicase complex would also make virus replication tolerant to host- or virus-induced shut down of translation at distal sites within the cytosol (Raaben et al., 2007). Notably, host translational shut down is well known for coronaviruses (Raaben et al., 2007) and specifically nsp1 has been implicated to play a role in this context by mediating host mRNA degradation (Narayanan et al., 2015; Kamitani et al., 2006). Coronaviruses may thus have evolved a two-pronged strategy to ensure efficient translation of viral proteins by establishing viral RNA synthesis in close proximity to actively translating ribosomes and by employing nsp1-mediated host cell mRNA degradation at RTC-distal sites. The strategy to assemble the viral RTC in close proximity to translation would also favor the coupling between genome translation and replication that has been proposed for picornaviruses and other positive-strand RNA viruses (de Groot et al., 1992; Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994). Finally, host cells are equipped with fine-tuned mechanisms of foreign RNA recognition (Gebhardt et al., 2017). As such, MDA5 has been identified as a key cytosolic pattern recognition receptor restricting coronavirus replication (Z\u00fcst et al., 2011). Likewise, the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway targets mRNAs of different origin containing aberrant features for degradation and has been newly demonstrated to also target cytosolic coronavirus mRNAs (Wada et al., 2018; Schweingruber et al., 2013). Therefore, proximity of viral mRNA synthesis and translation in a confined microenvironment protected from cytosolic surveillance factors can also be considered a mechanism to evade these cytosolic mRNA decay mechanisms and innate immune sensors of viral RNA.",

Indeed, the ability of BirAR118G to label viral and host factors independently of high affinity and prolonged molecular interactions enables the establishment of a comprehensive repertoire reflecting the history of protein association with the viral RTC, recorded during the entire course of infection. In future studies it will be important to provide an \u2018RTC-association map\u2019 with temporal resolution. Like we have seen for translation initiation factors in this study, association of host cell proteins with the viral RTC might not persist throughout the entire replication cycle but might be of importance only transiently or during specific phases of the replication cycle. Given its short labeling time, APEX2 indeed offers this possibility to dissect protein recruitment to the viral RTC in a time-resolved manner, that is to detect RTC-associated host proteins at specific time points post infection. This will ultimately result in a dynamic, high resolution molecular landscape of virus-host interactions at the RTC and provide an additional impetus to elucidate critical virus-host interactions that take place at the site of viral RNA synthesis. These interactions should be exploited in the development of novel strategies to combat virus infection, based on conserved mechanisms of interactions at replication complexes of a broad range of positive-stranded RNA viruses.",

Proteins were separated 1 cm into a 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A Coomassie stain was performed and 4 \u00d7 2 mm bands were cut with a scalpel. Proteins on gel samples were reduced, alkylated and digested with Trypsin (Gunasekera et al., 2012). Digests were loaded onto a pre-column (C18 PepMap 100, 5 \u00b5m, 100 A, 300 \u00b5m i.d. x 5 mm length) at a flow rate of 20 \u00b5L/min with solvent C (0.05% TFA in water/acetonitrile 98:2). After loading, peptides were eluted in back flush mode onto the analytical Nano-column (C18, 3 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 75 \u03bcm x 150 mm, Nikkyo Technos C. Ltd., Japan) using an acetonitrile gradient of 5% to 40% solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water/acetonitrile 4,9:95) in 40 min at a flow rate of 400 nL/min. The column effluent was directly coupled to a Fusion LUMOS mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer, Bremen; Germany) via a nano-spray ESI source. Data acquisition was made in data-dependent mode with precursor ion scans recorded in the orbitrap with resolution of 120\u2019000 (at m/z = 250) parallel to top speed fragment spectra of the most intense precursor ions in the Linear trap for a cycle time of 3 s maximum. Spectra interpretation was performed with Easyprot on a local, server run under Ubuntu against a forward + reverse Mus musculus 2016_04) and MHV 2016_07) database, using fixed modifications of carboamidomethylated on Cysteine, and variable modification of oxidation on Methionine, biotinylation on Lysine and on protein N-term, and deamidation of Glutamine and Asparagine. Parent and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.4 Da, respectively. Matches on the reversed sequence database were used to set a Z-score threshold, where 1% false discoveries (FDR) on the peptide spectrum match level had to be expected. Protein identifications were only accepted, when two unique peptides fulfilling the 1% FDR criterion were identified. MS identification of biotinylated proteins was performed in three independent biological replicates. For label-free protein quantification, LC-MS/MS data was interpreted with MaxQuant (version 1.5.4.1) using the same protein sequence databases and search parameters as for EasyProt. Match between runs was activated, however samples from different treatments were given non-consecutive fraction numbers in order to avoid over-interpretation of data. The summed and median normalized top3 peptide intensities extracted from the evidence table as a surrogate of protein abundance (Braga-Lagache et al., 2016) and LFQ values were used for statistical testing. The protein groups were first cleared from all identifications, which did not have at least two valid LFQ values. Protein LFQ levels derived from MaxQuant were log-transformed. Missing values were imputed by assuming a normal distribution between sample replicates. A two-tailed t-test was used to determine significant differences in protein expression levels between sample groups and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) test. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD009975.",

All cells, including non-treated control infections, were subjected to a coextraction/fixation procedure to remove free puromycin. Cells were labeled using anti-nsp2/3 antiserum and anti-puromycin antibodies. Nuclei are counterstained with DAPI. Z-projection of deconvolved z-stacks acquired with a DeltaVision Elite High-Resolution imaging system are shown. Note the gradual decrease of overlap between the viral replication and actively translating ribosomes highlighted in the intensity profiles. Scale bar: 20 \u00b5m; insets 5 \u00b5m.",
