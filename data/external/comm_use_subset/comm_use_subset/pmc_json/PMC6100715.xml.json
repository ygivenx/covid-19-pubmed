Following laryngectomy the tracheal epithelium becomes directly exposed to the relatively cold and dry ambient air entering the tracheostoma [1, 2]. This can cause: drying of the mucus, which makes it more viscous; reduction of ciliary activity that causes impaired mucociliary clearance [2\u20134]; and tracheal epithelium damage (loss of ciliated cells, goblet cell hyperplasia, and excessive mucus production and metaplasia) [4].",
