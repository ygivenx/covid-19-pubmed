She complained of severe myalgias, chills, and a fever two days earlier. She had been unable to go to work for the previous 4 days due to her illness. She admitted to taking ibuprofen, up to 800 mg every 2 hours for several days for her myalgias, but she and her husband denied any significant acetaminophen ingestion. She was hemodynamically unstable on presentation with a heart rate of 114 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 71/40 mm Hg. She was afebrile with a temperature of 36.4\u00b0C. Her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturations were 98% on room air. She was alert and oriented with a GCS of 15 and was able to give a history of her illness. Her head and neck exam was unremarkable, and no oral lesions were documented. Her respiratory and cardiac examinations were normal. Her abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly, and her skin was clear. A pelvic exam was not performed. Her past medical history was significant only for two uncomplicated pregnancies, a tubal ligation, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Her only medication was an oral contraceptive pill. Her social history was significant for 26 ounces of alcohol per week, mostly on weekends. There was no history of smoking, drug use, travel, or high-risk sexual behaviors.",

She was treated with intravenous fluid administration, and she was given broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for any bacterial pathogen that may be causing her SIRS. The next morning a liver panel was ordered and showed significantly elevated transaminases (AST 4090 U/L, ALT 1692 U/L, ALP 123 U/L, total bilirubin 24 umol/L, INR 2.3, PT 25.9 seconds, PTT 91 seconds, platelets 85 \u00d7 109/L) with signs of liver failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy but a relatively normal bilirubin. She was now leukopenic with a white blood cell count of 3.6 \u00d7 109/L. Her acetaminophen level later that day was undetectable. Regardless, she was started on an N-acetylcysteine infusion as treatment for a possible late presentation of acetaminophen toxicity. Her ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening (5 mm) but a negative sonographic Murphy's signs; the portal vein was patent. The imaging was considered consistent with hepatitis. She was initially thought to have liver dysfunction due to prolonged hypotension on presentation resulting in hepatic ischemia. Throughout that day, the patient developed fulminant liver failure with a severe lactic acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and required intubation. She was seen by multiple specialists throughout the course of the day and was considered for liver transplant but was deemed unsuitable. No cause for her liver failure was identified. She died later that day after developing vasopressor refractory hypotension, roughly 70 hours after presentation.",

She was screened for multiple additional viruses including parvovirus b19, cytomegalovirus, Ebstein-Barr virus, and all of these were negative. On her postmortem liver biopsy, she had signs of severe acute liver necrosis. There was no evidence of chronic underlying liver disease. All other organ systems were spared. Tissue samples from her liver were sent for multiple tests and were negative for influenza, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, corona virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Her polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was negative for cytomegalovirus virus and varicella zoster but positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1. Viral culture of her liver sample was positive for HSV type 1. Liver histology revealed diffuse acute liver necrosis with few inflammatory changes (Figure 1). Multiple viral inclusion bodies with the characteristic clear halo distinctive of Cowdry type A inclusions were seen in her hepatocytes (Figure 2). Immunostaining was positive for HSV antibodies (Figure 3). There was no evidence of disseminated HSV. Her cause of death was determined to be herpes simplex viral hepatitis causing fulminant liver failure.",

Renal failure is not uncommon in these patients [5, 11\u201314], and it has been shown to occur in up to 65% of patients with HSV-related ALF [3]. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is frequently reported [5, 8, 9, 15, 16], and encephalopathy is a late sign of the disease. Ninety percent of patients with HSV hepatitis have a characteristic liver profile, known as \u201canicteric hepatitis\u201d [6, 9, 17, 18]. Anicteric hepatitis refers to a liver profile showing a significant increase in transaminases (100\u20131000 fold) with a relatively normal or low bilirubin [1, 3, 6, 9, 16].

            "text": "Antemortem diagnosis of HSV hepatitis is difficult and is considered in only 23\u201342% of cases prior to autopsy [3, 15, 19]. Investigations to aid in the diagnosis for HSV hepatitis are limited. Viral serology cultures are extremely sensitive and can be used as a screening tool but are very poorly specific. Viral PCR testing may be useful but is often not rapidly available. Although not always possible due to coagulopathy, the gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy. Cowdry type A inclusions, nuclei with large eosinophilic ground glass-like inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, are pathognomonic for HSV hepatitis [8, 15]. Histology shows extensive areas of hepatocyte necrosis with adjacent congestion but minimal inflammatory infiltrates [20]. Immunohistochemical staining can be done to confirm the diagnosis of HSV, and the presence of viral antigens can be demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining and by identifying monoclonal antibodies against HSV antigens [20].",

Antiviral treatment with acyclovir has been used successfully [3, 5\u20137, 14, 17, 19, 22\u201325]. The extent of disease at the initiation of acyclovir plays a large role in its effectiveness, but outcomes probably improve with earlier initiation of therapy [3, 8, 15, 22]. Many authors recommend empiric treatment with acyclovir in patients with ALF of unknown origin [1, 3, 6, 8]. High urgency liver transplant should also be considered early in the course of the disease as it has shown to improve outcomes [3, 8, 22, 23].",
