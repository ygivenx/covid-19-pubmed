One excellent example of this is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of the liver (1). Interferon signaling drives the expression of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which mediate viral clearance. ISGs, however, can also be induced by other factors, including inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (2). HCV infection, which induces chronic inflammation of the liver, is associated with high serum TNF-\u03b1 (3, 4). Interestingly, anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment has been shown to lead to an improved virologic response to IFN-\u03b1/ribavirin antiviral therapy for HCV (5), while other data show safety of combined treatment but no effect on HCV viral loads of HCV treatment-naive individuals (6). The purpose of the present study is to define an important causal link between inflammation and the host hepatic innate immune response, with broad viral relevance.",

There is a dichotomous response to chronic HCV infection in the liver, and this response predicts who will and who will not respond to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 treatment. In patients that do not respond to therapy with IFN/ribavirin, hepatocytes have strong preactivation of the IFN-response, with high expression of a subset of ISGs (7\u20139). In patients exhibiting a sustained virologic response on therapy with IFN/ribavirin, tissue macrophages show a high expression of ISGs (7, 9). The expression of ISGs in macrophages or hepatocytes is more predictive of treatment outcome than IL28B polymorphisms (7); this finding suggests a link between hepatic inflammatory cell activation and viral clearance.",

            "text": "In HCV infection, we have found that the ISG15/USP18 pathway is an important regulatory pathway. Both ISG15 and USP18 are ISGs that are strongly upregulated in the livers of IFN treatment-resistant patients (7\u20139). ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that is strongly upregulated by IFN and conjugates to multiple cellular proteins (12, 13). USP18 is an ISG15-specific protease that is also upregulated by IFN-\u03b1 (12, 13). Both ISG15 and USP18 have been suggested to blunt type 1 IFN signaling (12, 14\u201316). In addition to its ability to remove ISG15 from its conjugated proteins, USP18 has been shown to bind to the type 1 IFN receptor and blunt IFN signaling (15). Upregulation of USP18 may represent a negative-feedback loop counteracting the effects of type 1 IFN. Furthermore, knockdown of USP18 increases both ISG induction and anti-HCV activity of IFN-\u03b1 (14), and data have shown that IFN-\u03b1 treatment given to mice in vivo increases hepatic USP18 and blunts the effect of a subsequent dose of IFN-\u03b1 (12). The mechanisms controlling USP18 expression in the liver are poorly understood but will have relevance to understanding innate immune mechanisms in chronic viral infection.",

For example, inflammatory stimuli, e.g., endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have been shown to upregulate USP18 in peritoneal exudate macrophages (18). If similar stimuli lead to increased USP18 expression in hepatocytes, then this pathway could represent a novel link between inflammatory and innate immune responses in the liver. The present study is based on the hypothesis that liver inflammation will directly impact hepatocyte expression of USP18 and therefore will impact IFN signaling. This link will have relevance to multiple diseases, since inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-\u03b1 and LPS have been shown to play roles in many liver diseases, including viral hepatitis (19\u201321). The link may also help to explain our observations in chronic HCV infection, since chronic HCV infection is characterized by increased serum TNF-\u03b1 (3, 4), increased hepatocyte USP18, and impaired IFN responsiveness (8). Quite apart from HCV, the importance of the link between hepatic inflammation and innate immune response lies in the downstream effects of the impairment of innate immunity. We speculate that by blocking IFN-\u03b1 signaling, USP18 expression may lead to an enhanced susceptibility to infection with interferon-sensitive viruses and enhanced viral proliferation. Support for this notion is found in a mouse study in which expression of USP18 in macrophages led to lower IFN responsiveness, leading to locally restricted replication of VSV (22).",

The enhanced USP18 expression was associated with decreased IFN-\u03b1-stimulated expression of p-STAT1 and ISGs, a phenomenon reversed by USP18 knockdown. As an in vivo correlate of our in vitro findings, experimentally induced hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury induced USP18 mRNA expression in liver and enhanced lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) replication, an effect not seen in USP18\u2212/\u2212 mice. These data demonstrate that certain inflammatory stimuli (TNF-\u03b1 and LPS), as well as ischemic injury, but not other cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) can lead to enhanced hepatocyte USP18 expression and thereby inhibit IFN signaling. These findings lend new knowledge to our understanding of how inflammation can modulate hepatic innate immune responses, with USP18 representing a potential target for intervention to reverse any proviral effect of inflammation.",

            "text": "We have previously shown that USP18 can modulate the type 1 IFN response (14). We sought to determine whether inflammatory stimuli could increase USP18 expression in hepatocytes. Liver tissue inflammation is mediated by both pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli, acting through diverse pathways. We therefore compared the effects of three proinflammatory stimuli (TNF-\u03b1, LPS, and IL-6) and one anti-inflammatory stimulus (IL-10), all four signaling through independent receptors and signaling cascades (38, 39). In a 24-h time course experiment, USP18 mRNA expression was measured after stimulation with LPS (100 ng/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (100 ng/ml), or IL-10 (10 ng/ml). USP18 mRNA expression was induced by TNF-\u03b1 and LPS but not by IL-6 or IL-10 (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, neither TNF-\u03b1 nor LPS treatments had a marked effect on Mx1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B), indicating that the effects we observe are not due to a generalized upregulation of ISGs or to type 1 IFN signaling. TNF-\u03b1 and LPS treatment also led to augmented USP18 protein expression by Western blotting (Fig. 1C) and by intracellular staining (Fig. 1D to F). Treatment of Huh7.5 cells with TNF-\u03b1 or LPS induced expression of USP18 in 74.1% \u00b1 8.9% and 70.5% \u00b1 5.2%, respectively, compared to untreated controls in which USP18 expression was 31.0% \u00b1 4.7% (Fig. 1Fi). USP18 induction was also demonstrated with a significant shift in the mean fluorescence intensity of USP18 staining after TNF-\u03b1 or LPS simulations (Fig. 1Fii). In these assays, the degree of protein expression did not correlate completely with mRNA expression, a finding that is consistent with many genes in the liver (40) in that the degree of mRNA induction was higher than the observed USP18 protein expression. However, the functional effects we observed in terms of IFN-\u03b1 responses were robust.",

Control cells were left untreated, followed by a 6-h IFN-\u03b1 treatment at 24 h. After the 6-h IFN-\u03b1 treatment, the cells were harvested, and Mx1 expression was measured by qPCR as a measure of IFN-inducible gene expression. As expected, a 6-h exposure to IFN-\u03b1 strongly induced Mx1 expression, whereas a 24-h exposure to TNF-\u03b1 and LPS did not (Fig. 2, columns 2, 3, and 5). Both TNF-\u03b1 and LPS pretreatment inhibited the effect of 6 h of exposure to IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 2, columns 2, 4, and 6), indicating that IFN-\u03b1 signaling was impaired in the presence of these inflammatory stimuli.",

We addressed this question by selective knockdown of USP18 mRNA. Thus, Huh7.5 cells transfected with USP18 siRNA or control siRNA were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/ml), and/or IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/ml) for 2 h or pretreated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h and then either left untreated or treated with IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/ml) for 2 h (a 2-h time point was selected for optimal expression of pSTAT1 in Huh7.5 cells). The expression of pSTAT1, STAT1, and ISG15 conjugates (as a marker of USP18 knockdown), USP18, and actin was detected by Western blotting. As seen in Fig. 3A, USP18 expression was largely knocked down in cells transfected with USP18 siRNA. IFN-\u03b1-induced phosphorylation of STAT-1 was inhibited by pretreatment (for 24 h) with TNF-\u03b1 or LPS (Fig. 3A, siRNA control lanes f and h versus lane d), but this effect is reversed by knockdown of USP18 (Fig. 3A, siRNA USP18, lanes f and h versus lane d). Of note, USP18 knockdown did not increase pSTAT1 in response to IFN-\u03b1 before 24 h; these findings are consistent with previous observations (12). We next wanted to confirm whether our findings from hepatoma cells would hold true in primary mouse hepatocytes. With this in mind, primary murine hepatocytes from USP18+/+ mice were isolated, transfected with USP18 siRNA or control siRNA, and then exposed to IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. After a washing step, the cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 for an additional 6 h. Mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR (normalized to expression of the HPRT housekeeping gene) as an index of downstream IFN-\u03b1 effect. IFN-\u03b1, LPS, and TNF-\u03b1 treatment blocked the effect of the final dose of IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 3B, columns 2, 3, 5, and 7). However, knockdown of USP18 reversed this effect and augmented the effect of IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 3B, columns 9, 10, 12, and 14). The data from this experiment are consistent with those obtained with human Huh7.5 cells (data not shown). Thus, the ability of TNF-\u03b1 and LPS to block IFN signaling is seen in both primary and immortalized hepatocytes.",

To determine whether the USP18-dependent blunting of hepatocyte IFN signaling was due to its ability to strip ISG15 from its conjugates, we blocked the process of ISGylation by knockdown of the ISG15 E1 enzyme, UBE1L. Murine hepatocyte UBE1L was knocked down via transfection with siRNA specific for UBE1L. USP18+/+ murine hepatocytes transfected with UBE1L siRNA or control siRNA were stimulated with IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h and then treated with an additional dose of IFN-\u03b1 for 6 h. Knockdown was measured in the hepatocytes transfected with UBE1L siRNA by Western blotting probing for UBE1L expression and ISG15 conjugate formation (Fig. 4A). Next, to examine the effect of this knockdown on ISG induction, wild-type murine hepatocytes transfected with UBE1L siRNA or control siRNA were stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/ml) and LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h and then restimulated with IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/ml) for 6 h, at which time Mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR. As seen in Fig. 4A, UBE1L knockdown was achieved, resulting in a decrease in ISG15 conjugates. However, as seen in Fig. 4B, we observed that neither the presence nor the relative absence of ISG15 conjugation impacted the ability of TNF-\u03b1 and LPS to block IFN-\u03b1 signaling since there was no change in ISG expression after 6 h of IFN-\u03b1 treatment when USP18+/+ hepatocytes transfected with anti-UBE1L siRNA were compared to hepatocytes transfected with irrelevant siRNA (Fig. 4B, siRNA control, columns 2, 5, and 7, and UBE1L siRNA, columns 9, 12, and 14). These results are consistent with there being no role for ISGylation (and, thus, for the ability of USP18 to strip ISG15 from its protein conjugates) in the ability of TNF-\u03b1 and LPS to block type 1 IFN signaling in hepatocytes, and this finding is in agreement with previous data showing that USP18 blocks IFN signaling independent of its enzymatic activity (15).",

As observed in Fig. 3A, STAT1 phosphorylation shows distinct activation profiles with IFN-\u03b1 stimulation compared to TNF-\u03b1 or LPS stimulation (Fig. 3A, siRNA control and siRNA USP18, lanes b and c compared to lane d). Although these data strongly suggest that the effect of LPS and TNF-\u03b1 stimulation are a result of direct induction of ISGs and not secondary to the induction of IFN-\u03b1, we wanted to confirm whether LPS and TNF-\u03b1 could induce type 1 or type 2 IFN (IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3) in primary murine hepatocyte. Thus, primary murine hepatocytes were treated with IFN-\u03b1 (100U/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/ml) for 6, 12,18, or 24 h; they were then lysed and assessed for IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and USP18 expression by qPCR. We observed that neither IFN-\u03b1, LPS, nor TNF-\u03b1 induce much, if any, hepatocyte expression of IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, although the same doses induce strong expression of USP18 (Fig. 5). Thus, the induction of ISGs by LPS and TNF-\u03b1 is very unlikely to reflect the induction of hepatocyte type 1 or type 2 IFN, which suggests that the observed USP18 induction is not due to type 1 or type 2 IFN secretion and autocrine stimulation of the IFN-\u03b1 receptor.",

We focused on small-molecule agents that have been linked to the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, because of the central role of this pathway in inflammatory activation in response to a large number of inflammatory mediators, including LPS and TNF-\u03b1 (42). We were particularly interested in inhibitors, such as silibinin, that in addition have been linked to clinical suppression of hepatic viral production (in the case of silibinin and HCV) (43, 44). Thus, we preincubated primary mouse hepatocytes for 30 min with various inhibitors of LPS and TNF-\u03b1 signaling and measured their impact on USP18 induction, while simultaneously measuring expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 mRNA, since NF-\u03baB is also known to promote IL-1\u03b2 transcription (45, 46). As seen in Fig. 7A and as described in Table 1, TNF-\u03b1 induced expression of USP18 was potently downregulated by all inhibitors tested, and this inhibition coincided with impaired IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression (Fig. 7B). Meanwhile, only two inhibitors potently (>80%) inhibited USP18 expression as well as IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression in response to LPS stimulation; NSC33994 (an inhibitor of Jak2) and silibinin (an inhibitor of IKK\u03b1) (Fig. 7A and B and Table 1). These data suggest that the induction of USP18 by TNF-\u03b1 and LPS, and possibly other inflammatory stimuli, is promoted by NF-\u03ba\u0392 signaling and that hepatocyte USP18 expression in particular\u2014compared to IL-1\u03b2\u2014may be an attractive target for pharmacologic manipulation in the setting of liver inflammation.",

Other inflammatory stimuli, including IL-10 and IL-6, did not induce USP18 or impair expression of ISGs, including USP18. In vivo, hepatic inflammatory stress (ischemia/reperfusion injury) led to increased hepatic USP18 gene expression that was associated with poor control of LCMV infection. Thus, the hepatic inflammatory milieu, contributed to by individual inflammatory cytokines and stimuli, modulates USP18 expression.

The cytokine specificity of our results is also consistent with finding that IL-6 alone is not able to induce USP18 in murine T cells (47). Only when T cells were treated with IL-6 and another proinflammatory cytokine, such as transforming growth factor \u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-23, was USP18 expression induced (47).

The binding of USP18 with the IFN-\u03b1 receptor has been shown to inhibit the interaction of STAT-1 with the IFN-\u03b1 receptor and thus block downstream IFN signaling (12, 15). Our data are consistent with this mechanism, since the blunting of hepatocyte IFN signaling after exposure to inflammatory stimuli is independent of USP18-mediated removal of ISG15 from its target proteins. The degree of TNF-\u03b1 and LPS-induced IFN-\u03b1 refractoriness was not changed by UBE1L knockdown, although ISGylation was considerably reduced. However, other mechanisms may also be at play. Recent work has demonstrated that USP18 has the ability to deubiquitinate the transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complexes required for NF-\u03baB activation in T cells and that overexpression of USP18 leads to decreased nuclear activation and impaired formation of TAK1 complexes (47). USP18-mediated NF-\u03baB inhibition may be of importance not only for T cell adaptive immunity but also for liver inflammation. The role of TAK1 in innate and adaptive immunity has been previously demonstrated (48), and studies have also shown that TAK1 deletion interferes with hepatocyte homeostasis and leads to hepatic injury (49). Thus, increased hepatocyte USP18 in response to inflammatory stimuli may constitute a negative-feedback cycle with relevance to multiple aspects of the liver's response to infection.",

In our present study, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury did not enhance LCMV production in USP18 knockout mice.

In this model, liver inflammation leads to increased hepatocyte USP18, which in turn makes the liver more susceptible to infections targeting the hepatocyte, such as HCV. This mechanism may help to explain the clinical observation that HCV infection of a transplanted, HCV-naive liver graft (that has gone through an ischemia/reperfusion cycle) is more aggressive than the original infection and that the severity of the reinfection correlates with the severity of the ischemia/reperfusion injury suffered during the transplant (51, 52). However, we have also found that USP18 is necessary but not sufficient on its own to induce an IFN-\u03b1 refractory state (53). With this in mind, we hypothesize that the innate immune response and its ability to control IFN-sensitive viruses will depend on cumulative effect of multiple intrahepatic signals, including the induction of USP18.",

These findings raise the possibility of pharmacologically targeting USP18 expression during inflammatory events to prevent the establishment of an IFN-\u03b1 refractory state. Previously, inhibition of Jak2 signaling led to a protection of mouse livers from ischemic insult (54). As well, silibinin has been shown to reduce of HCV liver graft reinfection (43) and enhance HCV clearance in IFN-\u03b1 nonresponders (55) via multiple mechanisms, including by direct inhibition of HCV NS5B RNA polymerase (44). USP18 modulation may be one mechanism by which silibinin exerts its anti-HCV effects.",

For example, we previously demonstrated that increased USP18 expression in the liver is predictive of patients with chronic HCV infection who will not respond to IFN-based anti-HCV therapy (8). Although we found that TNF-\u03b1 hepatic mRNA expression was increased in treatment nonresponders, it was relatively more increased in treatment responders (9). We suspect that whereas increased TNF-\u03b1 does contribute to USP18 expression, there are other stimuli, for example, LPS and perhaps the recently described interferon-lambda 4 (56), that also modulate hepatic USP18 expression. We propose that the ultimate USP18 expression is due to the liver's coordinate response to multiple stimuli. The finding that hepatic USP18 expression is modulated by inflammatory stimuli is a new paradigm for the interaction of the liver inflammatory microenvironment and viral infection.",
