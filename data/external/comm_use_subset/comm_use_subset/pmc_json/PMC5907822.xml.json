Understanding community ILI can shed light on the full burden of influenza. Furthermore, primary care clinics, a common setting for outpatient ILI surveillance, may not adequately capture cases who could seek care in other settings, such as emergency departments or urgent care clinics. In addition, systems that focus on medically attended ILI may have other biases (eg, access to care) and delays associated with care seeking that may affect sensitivity of testing and may not reflect influenza and other respiratory virus activity in the broader community.3, 4, 5 A comparison between community surveillance and outpatient medically attended ILI surveillance systems could help to determine how well medically attended surveillance systems reflect respiratory viral activity in the community.",

The cohort consists of approximately 250 households and is a primarily Latino population. Demographic information is collected upon enrollment. Households receive twice\u2010weekly text messages, asking if anyone has runny nose, congestion, sore throat, cough, body aches, or fever and report either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Home visits are performed by research staff to obtain a nasal swab from any participants meeting the ARI criteria (2 symptoms including fever, runny nose/congestion, sore throat, cough, and/or myalgia) with symptoms lasting < 5 days and who are still symptomatic. The ARI criteria for infants (less than 12 months of age) also include runny nose/congestion alone. Respiratory swabs are analyzed in a research laboratory using a BioFire FilmArray multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (BioFire Diagnostics LLC, Salt Lake City, UT) detecting influenza A virus (H1, H1N1pdm09, and H3), influenza B virus, adenovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1\u20104, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Further information on symptoms and care\u2010seeking behaviors is collected by interview at illness end. We limited our analysis to episodes meeting ILI criteria (fever with cough or sore throat) for appropriate comparison to ILI within IISP.",

Patients with symptom onset within 7 days of presentation are included, and ILI is defined as fever with cough or sore throat among patients \u2265 2 years of age, and fever with \u22651 of cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea among children < 2 years of age. Nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs are collected from the first 10 ILI patients of each week and tested at the NYC Public Health Laboratory for influenza using the CDC real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay. Specimens collected from October 2011 through August 2014 were further tested for respiratory pathogens by the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center using Taqman Array Card11, 12 (TAC, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) that included influenza A virus (H1, H1N1pdm09, and H3), influenza B virus, adenovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKu1, NL63, OC43), enterovirus, HMPV, HPIV types 1\u20104, RSV, rhinovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes.

Included cases were those in persons with symptom onset between morbidity and mortality weekly report (MMWR) weeks 40 through 20 (approximately early October through mid\u2010May) of each influenza season. We limited comparisons to viral pathogens common to the Taqman, Biofire, and Luminex assays, specifically influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, coronaviruses, enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, HMPV, HPIV types 1\u20104, and RSV. Descriptive analyses were conducted on ILI episodes reported from the MoSAIC and NYC IISP site populations for demographic characteristics of age, gender, and whether participants had received the seasonal influenza vaccine at least 14 days prior to illness onset. Episodes in a single individual that were at least 14 days apart were included as separate illness episodes. Symptoms reported in MoSAIC and IISP populations were compared using a set of log\u2010binomial regression models adjusted for age to estimate the relative risk of individual symptoms among persons with ILI reported through community\u2010level surveillance compared with medical provider surveillance. A second set of age\u2010adjusted log\u2010binomial regression models was used to estimate the relative prevalence of individual pathogens detected in persons with ILI through MoSAIC compared to IISP. Due to incomplete data, vaccination was not adjusted for. A subset analysis was performed comparing MoSAIC participants who sought care to IISP participants. Correlation coefficients were calculated for seasonal distribution of influenza and RSV viruses between the two surveillance systems. Statistical significance was set at .05, and analyses were performed using SAS (v 9.3) software.",
