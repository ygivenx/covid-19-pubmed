IBV is characterized by a high mutation rate resulting in changes in viral genotype, antigenic properties, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and eventually the course of the disease (7). Several IBV serotypes or antigenic variant strains emerged due to changes in the IBV genome through point mutations, deletions, insertions or RNA recombination and these variants are often responsible for IB outbreaks in vaccinated chicken flocks (8\u201310). Hence, pathogenic variants such as D274 and D1466, 793B, Israel variant 1, and 2 (11, 12) have evolved over the last decades.",

Cross-protection between IBV strains can be ranged from very poor to moderate protection according to the results of IBV cross-protection studies (21). Under the field conditions, chickens are exposed to different IBV variant strains at the same time. Therefore, it is important to evaluate different vaccine combination safety and efficacy against the circulating IBV strains (19, 20). A recent study carried out by Terregino et al. (22) where the simultaneous or alternate use of Ma5 and 793B, commonly employed in Europe, induces high levels of protection against heterologous IBV types such as D1466 or QX strains. The broadening of protection was previously attributed to increased cellular and local immune responses at tracheal mucosa after combining different live IBV in vaccination programs (18, 19).",

The last two groups were non-vaccinated challenged (G7) and non-challenged control (G8) (Table 1). Ciliary activity was evaluated at 5 days post vaccination (DPV) (both prime and booster vaccination). At 14 days after the prime and booster vaccination, blood samples were collected and the seroconversion against IBV was evaluated. At 28 DPV, birds were challenged with 105EID50/0.2 ml/bird with the wild-type Eg/1212B/2012 variant 2 IBV virus via the ocular route (17). Oro-pharyngeal swabs were collected from challenged chicks at 3, 5, and 7 DPC for quantification of virus shedding. the post challenge ciliary activity was evaluated at 7 DPC, where 5 chicks/group were euthanized. Also, the trachea and kidneys were collected from 3 chicks/group for histopathological examination. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected from remaining birds for serological evaluation (Table 1).",

Studies showed that sequential inoculation of different IBV may increase the broadness of the reacting antibody titers (44). This was true as indicated by the increase of the cross-reactivity of sera collected from groups received IB-Ma5 and IB-793B as prime or booster vaccination to IB-VAR2 antigen, however, it was significantly lower than homologous vaccination groups (i.e., IB-VAR2) at 28 days post vaccination. Additionally, the mean HI antibody titers in the heterologous variant IBV vaccine groups (i.e., IB-793B) showed a relatively higher increase at 14 DPC indicating the challenge virus replication in vaccinated birds. It is worthy to note that antisera of IBV H52, H120, and 793B failed to neutralize Iranian IBV genotypes including IS-1494, IS-720, 793/B, and IR-1 (45).",

Meanwhile, 50\u201360% protection was reported in groups primed or boosted with IBV-793B with significantly higher ciliary damage. This finding further emphasizes the importance of the homology of the IBV vaccine to the predominant field strains to provide the highest protective efficacy.

Similarly, our results showed that the inclusion of IB-793B vaccine strain did not reduce the virus shedding and the homologous IBV-VAR2 vaccine primed and boosted groups have the most significant reduction in virus shedding titers (P-value <0.001) and the lower number of shedders. Though the IBV-793B vaccines have been advocated to induce heterologous protection, recent studies showed that the protection is mainly attributed to the relative virulence of the strain allowing it to displace other field strains after vaccine introduction (46). The inclusion of a vaccinated group primed and boosted with IB-793B which showed only 50% protection further support that relative protection afforded by IB-Ma5: IB-793B prime-boost programs is probably attributed to the effect of the Mass vaccine (47).",
