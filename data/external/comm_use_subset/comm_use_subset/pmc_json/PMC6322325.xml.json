Stool consistency had been very soft to watery, and stool frequency had been > 7 times/day. Blood and mucus had been observed in the faeces. Thus, diarrhoea was considered to be induced by colitis. Four months prior to the current presentation, a faecal sample of the dog was subjected to real-time PCR analysis (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Clostridium perfringens \u03b1 toxin, Clostridium difficile toxin A&B, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Salmonella spp., Canine parvovirus type 2, canine distemper virus and canine enteric coronavirus genes by a veterinary practitioner; a positive reaction for Campylobacter jejuni was detected in the analysis. The dog was treated with tylosin (Tylan, Eli Lilly Japan K.K., Kobe, Japan; 10 mg/kg PO, q12h) for 7 days by a veterinary practitioner; however, stool conditions did not improve. Administration of an antidiarrhoeal (Diabuster, Kyuritsu, Tokyo, Japan; 1 tablet PO, q12h) containing berberine tannate, bismuth subnitrate, geranium herb, nutgalls and scopolia extract, and an antiflatulent (Bioymbuster, Kyuritsu, Tokyo, Japan; 1 tablet PO, q12h) containing Bacillus coagulans, Bifidobacterium longuin, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecalis and pancreatin, improved stool conditions. However, once these drugs were discontinued, the diarrhoea recurred.",

Treatment with metronidazole was proposed; however, the owner rejected this treatment because of the potential for metronidazole-induced neuropathy. To investigate the cause of focal seizures, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed. Mild ventriculomegaly was detected in the brain of the dog on imaging, but it was unclear whether the lesion was related to the seizures.

Therefore, instead of treatment with metronidazole, oral faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed after obtaining written informed consent from the owner. This treatment was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. Fresh faeces were collected from a 9-year-old, 11.0-kg, sexually intact healthy male beagle maintained for research purposes. The healthy dog was housed in a cage and fed a commercial diet (Science Diet Adult, Hill\u2019s-Colgate Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) once daily. Water was provided ad libitum. Physical and clinical examinations, including a CBC, a serum biochemical analysis, radiography, an abdominal ultrasound and faecal examination, did not find any abnormalities in the healthy dog, and real-time PCR analysis of a faecal sample did not detect any pathogens. Immediately after faecal collection, approximately 60 g of faeces was dissolved in 50 mL of tap water. The faecal solution was filtered through a medical gauze pad twice. A total of 30 mL of a filtered faecal solution was obtained and orally administered to the recipient dog using a syringe.",

However, it is still controversial whether C. difficile plays a pathological role in the development of diarrhoea in dogs [8]. C. difficile has been isolated both from the faeces of diarrheic dogs and those of healthy, non-diarrheic dogs, with various incidence rates depending on sample populations [9\u201313]. Several studies suggested a significant association between the presence of C. difficile toxins in faeces and canine diarrhoea [9\u201311]. An outbreak of C. difficile-associated disease was also reported in a small animal veterinary teaching hospital [14]. In contrast, a previous study failed to reproduce CDI in healthy adult dogs after administration of C. difficile with or without antibiotics [15]. In the present report, real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography detected C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B genes and proteins in a faecal sample. Physical and clinical examinations did not identify any other causes for chronic large bowel diarrhoea. In addition, C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B genes and proteins became negative after oral FMT, and diarrhoea did not recur despite no further pharmacological treatment. Based on these clinical and molecular findings, diarrhoea in this dog was considered to be induced by C. difficile-associated colitis.",

In a recent study that reported the clinical efficacy of FMT for puppies with canine parvovirus infection [17], faecal suspension was infused into the proximal portion of the rectum in puppies by retention enema. Since clinical data of FMT are very limited in veterinary medicine, there is no consensus regarding the appropriate method of faecal administration in dogs. In the present case, FMT was performed by oral administration of faeces diluted with tap water. Oral FMT was also shown to be effective for the treatment of CDI in a marmoset [3], whereby faeces were mixed with the marmoset\u2019s usual food and fed to the subject. In human patients with CDI, there was a report of cases refractory to lower GI delivery that responded to FMT via oral frozen faecal capsules [18]. Oral FMT is much easier than other methods of FMT, such as FMT with endoscopy, nasogastric/nasoenteric tubes and retention enema. Although potential advantages and disadvantages exist for FMT via the upper or lower GI tract, the present report suggests that oral administration of a faecal solution can be a useful FMT method in dogs.",

In this report, because metronidazole was not administered at the owner\u2019s request, it is unclear whether C. difficile detected in the dog was metronidazole-resistant. Previous studies have shown that FMT was effective for the treatment of antibiotics-resistant recurrent CDI in humans, with cure rates of > 80% [5\u20137], and a marmoset [3]. To evaluate the effect of FMT for metronidazole-resistant recurrent CDI in dogs, further studies are required.",

In the current report, faecal microbiota was not analyzed in the dog with CDI.
