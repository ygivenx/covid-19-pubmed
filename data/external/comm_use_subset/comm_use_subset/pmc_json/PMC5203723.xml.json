The military formulated \u201cthe Regulations of the PLA\u2019s prevention and control of infectious diseases\u201d in 2008 and the \u201cEmergency Plan for Military Disposal of Emergency Public Health Events\u201d in 2009, as well as the \u201cMilitary-civilian Cooperation Mechanism of Prevention and Control for Infectious Diseases\u201d in 2006 and the \u201cMilitary-civilian Cooperation Mechanism of Emergency Disposal for Emergency Public Health Events\u201d in 2008.

The responses to H1N1 in 2009 and to avian influenza H7N9 in 2014 highlighted the importance of military-civilian joint prevention and control. Test reagents were co-developed in record time; efficient medicine and a specific vaccine for H1N1 were developed and prepared, effectively preventing the prevalence of H1N1 in China. A Peramivir and sodium chloride injection was successfully developed and prepared, which played an important role in treating severe H7N9 cases. During the prevention and control of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Western Africa, military joint national medical rescue contributed significantly to fighting the outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia [24, 25].\n",
