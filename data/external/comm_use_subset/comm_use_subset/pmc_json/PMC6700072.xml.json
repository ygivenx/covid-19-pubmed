            "text": "Noroviruses (NoV) are important pathogens causing gastroenteritis in children and young animals. These viruses can be classified into at least six distinct genogroups (GI\u2013GVI) based on their major capsid protein (VP1) sequences1. The bovine noroviruses (BNoV) cluster into genogroup III (GIII), and can be further divided into two distinct genotypes: genotype 1 (GIII.1) and genotype 2 (GIII.2). The GIII.1 strains appear more virulent than the GIII.2 strains2,3. Because there is no suitable cell culture system for BNoV, the precise pathogenicity of BNoV still requires investigation4. Currently, GIII.1 strains have been detected in 9 countries, the GIII.2 strains are the most prevalent worldwide, and have been detected in 16 countries5\u20137. In 2009, a NoV strain identified in sheep feces was proposed to be NoV GIII.3 based on the complete capsid genes of the strain8. However, there is only one complete VP1 sequence for this genotype in the GenBank database (GenBank accession number EU193658), and no genome information for this strain is yet available.",

The BNoV genomes are organized into three open reading frames (ORF). Starting from the 5\u2032 end of the genome, ORF1 encodes the viral nonstructural proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RdRp is a key enzyme, responsible for transcription, the replication of the viral genome, and the accurate initiation of RNA synthesis, which is essential for preventing the loss of viral genetic information9,10. ORF2 encodes VP1, which is the major structural component of the NoV and is involved in receptor recognition, host specificity, and immunogenicity11. The X-ray crystallographic structure of human NoV shows that VP1 contains two major domains, a well-conserved shell (S) domain and a more variable protruding (P) domain. The P domain is further divided into the P1 and the highly variable P2 domains12. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the BNoV P domain indicates that it is similar to the GI.1 P domain, whereas the P1 interface loop is very similar to that of GII13. Variations in the VP1 amino acid (aa) sequence occur frequently, and may allow the virus to escape antibody neutralization, these variation are also associated with the emergence of new epidemic strains14,15. ORF3 is a hypervariable region in the NoV and encodes the minor capsid protein (VP2), which may function in maintaining the stability of NoV particles16.",

Different NoV VP1 genotypes may have different abilities to bind HBGAs. For example, the GII.4 viruses are thought to bind a wider range of HBGAs and therefore have larger susceptible populations than the other genotypes24. A three-dimensional model was generated based on the X-ray crystallographic structure of the BNoV VP1 P domain and showed that Bo/BET\u201317/18/CH was most similar to that of strain Jena (GIII.1), although it has a longer interface loop (Fig. 4). Strain Bo/BET\u201317/18/CH also has many amino acid mutations in VP1, especially in the P2 domain.

Similar phenomena have been reported in human NoV and porcine NoV25\u201327, which may be attributable to the limited number of NoV sequences available. RNA recombination is considered to be one of the main drivers of NoV evolution24. The majority of intergenotype and intragenotype recombination events in NoV, including BNoV, occur at a single location in the ORF1\u2013ORF2 overlap28,29. Recombination at this junction allows the virus to alter its viral capsid while retaining the region involved in the replication of the viral genome. This reorganization can also allow the virus to escape herd immunity24. As an example, the recombinant type GII.Pb/GII.3 is one of the most prevalent NoV, and still prevalent today in children30. Until now, two recombinant types have been identified in BNoV: one is GIII.2-related RdRp sequence and a GIII.1-related capsid sequence, and the other is GIII.1-related RdRp sequence and a GIII.2-related capsid sequence. The second recombinant type is circulating in different geographic regions31\u201335. However, the first recombinant type has only been reported in the United States34. Interestingly, strain Bo/BET\u201317/18/CH is the strain of a recombination event involving a GIII.2-related RdRp sequence and a novel genotype-related capsid sequence.

These seven strains were from four farms across two provinces that are more than 3000 km apart, indicating that this new genotype has spread across local provinces (Fig. 1). Interestingly, on the farms positive for the novel VP1 genotype, the proportions of the novel genotype in the BNoV-positive samples were 1/1, 1/2, 2/2, and 3/4. Therefore, it seems that the novel VP1 genotype strains were predominant on the affected farms. However, this result may be biased because the number of samples tested was small.",
