            "text": "The United States (U.S.) is the third largest pork-producer country and the second major exporter globally1. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) first appeared in the southeastern region of the U.S. in 1989, causing reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disorders in pigs of all ages2. Subsequently, the disease spread throughout the North American swine population and became endemic. Although the disease was first discovered in the U.S., earliest serological evidence suggests that the virus first emerged in eastern Canada3. In 2011, the annual losses associated with PRRS virus (PRRSv) infections on the national economy of the U.S. reached up to USD 664 million4. Thus, arguably, the disease has become one of the most import swine diseases and has been considered a national threat to food security5. PRRSv is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus and belongs to the Arteriviridae family3. The virus has seven structural and 14 non-structural proteins encoded by a genome that comprises nine open reading frames (ORF)6. Envelope surface glycoprotein (GP5) is encoded by gene segment ORF5, which is characterized by the highest genetic diversity compared to other ORF segments, and thus, became popular for most molecular epidemiology studies7\u20139.",

The European strain is referred to as Type I genotype and has relatively low prevalence in the U.S. The North American strain is referred to as Type II genotype and is currently causing most PRRSv infections in the country11. PRRSv can be transmitted rapidly through direct and indirect contact12, which include between-farm transmission through animal movement (direct contact between infected and susceptible animals), fomites and airborne transmission13, 14. Endemic PRRSv strains are commonly characterized by annual seasonal increases in the number of observed outbreaks, with incidence of cases being low during spring and summer and high during fall and winter15. However, the emergence of new virulent viruses is also a common characteristic of PRRSv (referred to as emerging strains), with \u201cspreader events\u201d being recognized for different United States regions16; those emerging strains are of considerable concern to the swine industry as they cause severe economic losses. It is currently unknown if alternative transmission routes are equally important for emerging and endemic PRRSv strains.",

            "text": "Molecular characterization of PRRSv constitutes a substantial portion of the pathogen\u2019s surveillance efforts in the U.S., where a large number of sequences became available due to the growing accessibility to affordable molecular tests26. However, the increase in the size of PRRSv\u2019s genomic data led to new challenges regarding the interpretation of results, especially considering the rapid mutation and recombination events of the virus. One of those challenges relates to the need for differentiating endemic from emerging strains. Past PRRSv evolutionary epidemiology studies either focused on establishing associations between phylogenetics and outbreak characteristics in different geographical levels7, 27\u201329, or discriminating between endemic and emerging strains to infer about their spread and maintenance within affected swine populations7, 10, 30\u201332. Those studies relied on traditional phylogenetic methods to either genotype new viruses using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns, or assess correlations between the similarities of nucleotide sequences and spatio-temporal outbreak dynamics33. Such methods ignore important evolutionary parameters, uncertainties associated with phylogenetic relationships, and spatio-temporal factors that shape the evolutionary history of rapidly evolving pathogens like PRRSv34, 35. Thus, tools provided by the field of phylodynamics have become a necessity to effectively characterize the joint evolutionary and epidemiological patterns of rapidly evolving pathogens36. These methods heavily rely on Bayesian statistical frameworks, which can provide methods that are able to account for uncertainties in the evolutionary parameters of the phylogeny, and subsequently can provide estimates on population dynamics, divergence times, and history of geographic spread37.",

Such studies answered important a long-standing hypothesis on the evolutionary epidemiology of PRRSv, and subsequently encouraged the notion for such methods to be routinely applied in surveillance of field data with the ultimate goal of supporting risk-based interventions. However, following the continuous rapid growth in both size and complexity of PRRSv data, routine implementation of such analytical methods is quite challenging. To date, no analytical pipelines were formulated to rigorously distinguish between endemic and emerging PRRSv strains. Instead, the distinction between such strains is naively made, for example, through the incidence of outbreaks and traditional phylogenetic methods. The application of more robust analytical pipelines that specializes in characterizing spatiotemporal dynamics of PRRSv strains can be of great value for the swine industry by improving surveillance, and subsequently control and prevention measures.",

We estimated, in quantitative and qualitative terms, the evolutionary history and extent of the association between environmental and demographic factors and geographical distribution of the PRRSv in endemic settings. We demonstrated that pig density and climate seasonality were not only important factors for maintaining endemic PRRSv strains, but also, they likely shaped genetic diversity over time as well as spatiotemporal diffusion patterns. Simultaneously, we revealed the wide and rapid spatiotemporal diffusion characteristics in the evolution of emerging strains. We demonstrated how the combined use of the analytical tools here was not only able to identify the geographical risk of PRRSv outbreaks but also were able to distinguish between endemic and emerging strains.",

The AUC values of the final Maxent model suggested that the selected environmental variables were adequate predictors for PRRSv outbreaks between 1998 and 2016 (Table 1). Pig density accounted for most of the background spatial risk in the Midwest (Table 1), as suggested elsewhere5, 18, 19. However, climate seasonality and land cover features had a relatively large role (approximately 40% relative contribution; Table 1) in predicting the risk of PRRSv outbreaks. Indeed, the combination of rainy and windy seasons, the large temperature variation over the course of the year, and proximity to permanent wetland, a dominant demographic characteristic of the Midwest, led to seasonal increases in the number of outbreaks, and contributed in maintaining the endemic state of PRRSv50. Despite these findings; it is important to point out that farms in the Midwest are mainly closed facilities where pigs are contained in a closed environment to minimize the impact of climate. Thus, the effect of climate and land cover may be due, at least in part, to climate- related anthropogenic activities, such as management practices, pig or semen movements and nearby farming activities, which occurs on seasonal patterns, as suggested elsewhere5, 19.",

This finding, that area spread of PRRSv in high pig-dense regions (such as the Midwest) during certain environmental conditions (e.g. seasonal winds), has been previously suggested38. However, results from the spatial diffusion models (Table 2) for clades A and B showed that the transmission of the virus was heterogeneous rather than homogenous, suggesting that long-distance pig movements, climate- related anthropogenic activities, or other unexplored indirect networks (e.g. service providers) might play a larger role compared to aerosol transmission per se in dispersal of the virus across the Midwest51, 52. Our results are in agreement with past studies, which suggested that the shape of pig transportation networks within and between production regions have a significant role in shaping the phylogeny of the virus and mirrors the spatial diffusion of endemic strains14, 33, 53.",

For example, while all selected clades showed typical seasonality in the population size overtime, viruses of clades A and B favoured the expansion model (which assumes that population growth increases over time54), and exponential model (which assumes that population growth is fixed overtime54) (Table S2), viruses of clade C significantly favoured the logistic model (Table S2), which assumes that the population growth of the virus decreases over time54. In addition, the inferred growth rate for clades A and B was similar, but was 90% slower than that of Clade C. This result suggests that clade C was an emerging strain, which rapidly spread across the Midwest and then reached a certain equilibrium or died out. Indeed, the distinct fast growth rate (Fig. 3C) of emerging strains, such as those observed in clade C, accelerates their peak genetic diversity, which subsequently lead to population decline. Ecologically speaking, such observation may suggest that environmental conditions in the Midwest may accelerate the spread of emerging strains, ultimately leading to virus population decline due to the rapid decrease in the size of the susceptible population. Furthermore, clade C contained viruses that belonged to RFLP type 1-7-4 and some of its close relatives, which has been reported previously33 as an emerging virulent strain which caused severe outbreaks between 2014 and 2015 across the U.S. Moreover, clade C demonstrated a substantially larger mean evolutionary and dispersal rates than clades A and B (Table 2), suggesting a distinct evolutionary behaviour of an emerging PRRSv strain. Finally, Fig. 5 demonstrates the rapid and widespread of the MCC tree branches of clade C all other the Midwestern swine production system, and did not accumulate in the highest-risk areas predicted by the Maxent model, like clades A and B. This result suggests that clade C evolution and spread is not maintained by the environmental characteristics of the Midwest region.",

This conclusion is important, because airborne spread of this particular clade would have likely resulted on homogeneous dispersal. In contrast, the heterogeneous dispersal found here suggests that the clade spread by mechanisms other than airborne spread only. Furthermore, our inferred MCC trees for clade C demonstrated, similarly to the other clades assessed here, an initial low among-branch spatial diffusion rate variation, followed by a substantial increase in the rate variation at the branches\u2019 tips at the later stages of the virus dispersal (Fig. 4). However, both mean evolutionary and dispersal rates were substantially larger compared to those inferred for clades A and B (Table 2). Such behaviour is consistent with the emerging nature of clade C, because herds with a population that is na\u00efve against emerging strains would accelerate virus mutation within the farm and, the virus geographical dispersal rate due to a subsequent increase in the between-farm transmission rates, associated with animal transportation activities.",

Furthermore, they continued to use the RFLP patterns to genotype the newly detected strains and made unrealistic and unsupported conclusions about their origins, transmission and evolution. A comparison between the MCC trees of the three selected clades (Fig. 4) and the ML tree (Figure S1), shows substantial discrepancies between their topologies estimated by the Bayesian phylodynamic and ML methods, respectively. Furthermore, the MCC tree (Figure S2) demonstrates how the past RFLP pattern classification method based on the ML tree for PRRSvs was redundant and doesn\u2019t correctly place newly detected viral strains in their truly related viral clade or cluster. In contrast, by accounting for important evolutionary and epidemiological information in our Bayesian phylodynamic models, we were able to estimate and quantify many inferences (Table 2) that distinguish between endemic and emerging strains and, therefore, we made realistic and data-supported conclusions about their evolutionary, spatial and temporal characters. Our analytical approach offers a realistic and robust framework for spatial inference from genetic data, when information about the specific geographical locations of the outbreaks (latitude/longitude) is available. Past studies14, 33 attempted to infer the phylogeographic history of the virus using discrete traits (i.e. countries or regions, instead of actual geographical locations), which doesn\u2019t provide a realistic representation of the spatial diffusion process of the virus within a geographical region. Indeed, here we could not only provide a realistic representation of the spatiotemporal diffusion process of the virus within the Midwest, but also we were able to quantify the spatial dispersal rate of this diffusion process and distinguish between the phylogeographic evolutionary characteristics of endemic and emerging strains. Furthermore, we could, indirectly, establish relationships between the geographical suitability for endemic strains (which has been predicted spatial risk by Maxent model) and their evolutionary history. To our knowledge there is no valid quantitative method that can statistically link result outputs from both analytical methods. That said, we must acknowledge that the direct inclusion of the Maxent environmental predictors into the phylodynamic analysis might improve our posterior inferences about the evolutionary dynamics of the virus in the Midwest. Lemey et\nal., (2014) developed an extension for his novel Bayesian discrete phylogeographic inference37, that can include and exclude environmental variables into the phylodynamic model56, but the method is currently not optimized for continuous space phylogeography, as is the case of the study here. Optimizing the GLM method for continuous space phylogeography would be of great value for future studies as well as for molecular surveillance, as it yields more realistic inferences about the spatial and evolutionary epidemiology of rapidly evolving pathogens like PRRSv. Therefore, our study represents a motivation to pursue future studies related to establishing a full quantitative pipeline for combining the inferences derived from both analytical methods.",

Such information would substantially improve the inferences of the methods presented here. With the continuous advancements in the phylodynamic methods, described above, the inclusion of pig movement into future phylogeographic models of PRRSv will soon be possible as it would, indeed, yield a more realistic inference about the spatiotemporal evolutionary patterns of PRRSv endemic and emerging strains. Finally, data represented only a sample from the region, and data from other farms and systems may have helped to improve our predictions; noteworthy, however, the quantity of data available to us is unprecedented.",

However, endemic strains are characterized by a substantially slower population growth and evolutionary rates, as well as smaller spatial dispersal rates when compared to emerging strains. Thus, study here demonstrates an analytical framework for inferring the evolutionary history of strains that coincidently circulate in a region. The framework provided valuable inferences with application to disease control, including, for example, predictions on the likelihood that specific clades or strains will continue to spread, or not, and the most likely mechanism of spread, as suggested by the homogeneity of the dispersal pattern. While we were unable to provide a direct quantitative link between the analytical methods used in this study, the results presented here will help to inform decisions on disease surveillance and control for, arguably, one of the most important non-regulated diseases affecting one of the largest food animal industries in the world.",

This method has recently become popular for predicting spatial distribution of infectious diseases of both public health and veterinary significance and has been described extensively elsewhere64, 65. We used the default logistic model, convergence threshold, regularization, and number of iterations. We used a Jackknife test to calculate the contribution of each environmental variable to the final Maxent model, and evaluated the performance of the candidate Maxent models by partitioning the data into training and testing sets and using the threshold independent method (TIm)66. We set the TIm k-fold partitioning scheme to create 5 partitions and randomly sample each partition with replacement, where our candidate Maxent model was tested five times (k = 5) against 10,000 randomly generated background points (pseudo-absences). Subsequently, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) through a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plot of the sensitivity vs. 1 - specificity over the whole range of threshold values between 0 and 1. We used training AUC for model building, whereas the testing sets to evaluate model accuracy using the average value of the AUC calculated for each partitioned set. AUC values >0.75 for both training and testing data were considered reliably discriminating models and indicated that the selected environmental layers were adequate predictors67, 68. Finally, because the geographic extent of the study area was fairly large, we used a calibrated AUC (cAUC) final Maxent model to evaluate the presence of the spatial sorting bias (SSB) as suggested elsewhere69. If the cAUC value was close to 1, then we concluded the absence of SSB (i.e. locations within the Midwest region with the highest number of observed outbreaks have a small impact on the resulted Maxent model), whereas if the value was close to zero, we concluded the opposite. We then plotted the spatial probability distribution of PRRSV outbreaks predicted by the final Maxent model (Fig. 1B) using ArcGIS version 10.441.",

We used a 3-codon position mixed GTR + \u0393 substitution model to realistically represent the sequence data for all the three clades (as indicated by the value of the BIC using ParitionFinder). Next, we evaluated five tree prior models for each of the three clades under a separate analytical setting, including (1) the constant population size (CP)74; (2) the exponential growth (EG)45; (3) the expansion growth (EGx)54; (4) the logistic growth (LG)54 parametric coalescent models; and (5) the nonparametric, piecewise-constant Bayesian Skygrid (BSg) coalescent model, which employ a Gassian Markov Random Field (GMRF) prior to smoothing the trajactories of the past population dynamics (BSg-GMRF)75. Furthermore, for each tree prior model, we evaluated two branch-rate models using: (1) the uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN)76 branch-rate prior model, and; (2) the uncorrelated exponential (UCED)76 branch-rate prior model. We estimated parameters of the branch-rate prior distributions using the continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)-rate reference 77 as a hyperprior for the mean of the lognormal and exponential distributions, and an exponential hyperprior for the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution. Isolation dates of the sequences were used to calibrate tree-height (divergence times) estimates. We estimated the marginal likelihood of each candidate relaxed-clock models (ten candidate models for each of the three clades) using path-sampling (PS)77, 78 and stepping-stone sampling (SS)79\u201381 estimators. We estimated the posterior evolutionary parameters, phylogeny and population demographics under each candidate relaxed model using two replicate MCMC simulations for 200 million cycles and sampled every 20,000th state, to assess the stability of the marginal-likelihood estimates. We used Tracer v. 1.682 to assess the reliability of the MCMC simulations by examining the convergence of each MCMC simulation to the stationary distribution and calculating effective sample size (ESS)83 for every parameter. We assessed mixing of each chain over the stationary distribution by monitoring the acceptance rates for all parameters. We then evaluated the fit of each candidate relaxed-clock models based on the resulting marginal-likelihood estimates using the Bayes factor (BF) comparison approach (Table S2). Finally, we used the best-fitting branch-rate prior (UCED v.s. UCLN) with the BSg-GMRF coalescent model (Table S2) to generate a BSg plot of the effective population size trajectories between 1998 and 2016 for each PRRSv clade.",

Briefly, the method implements a diffusion rate variation by rescaling the diffusion process along each branch of the inferred posterior phylogeny83, 84. This procedure is achieved through scalers drawn from a specific distribution, which generates a scaled mixture of a wide range of relaxed-random walks. We used the priors of the best-fitting demographic models (coalescent tree prior/branch rate combinations), from the above analyses (Table S2), and extended the analyses using additional, independent runs to assess for the best continuous trait model that accommodate among-branch diffusion rate variation for each selected viral clade. This procedure included additional simulations (in duplicates to assess the stability of the resulting marginal-likelihoods) to evaluate the four continuous trait models implemented in BEAST, which included the simple na\u00efve homologous Brownian model, and three heterogeneous relaxed random walks (RRW) models (Cauchy, gamma and lognormal probability distribution). We ran the subsequent MCMC simulations for 500 million states and sampled every 50,000 states.
