In addition, the control of LightMix Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP-gene (TibMolbiol, Berlin, Germany) was used for the SARS-CoV-2 specific assay. Respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum) were obtained from patients and contact persons. Sputum samples were diluted in 2 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

The Public Health Microbiology Laboratory in Bavaria was confronted with SARS-CoV-2-related events very early: once the assays and control materials arrived and the PCR assays were performed for the first time, a large contact investigation around the first German COVID-19 patient (data not shown) was immediately started, with so far more than 700 samples. Evaluation and verification of the new assays and testing real samples had to take place simultaneously within a very short time. ",

However, our E gene assay showed high background levels hampering a clear evaluation of the assays. Each mastermix has its own proprietary composition, which may explain the differences in the performance of a certain PCR assay. Using commercial kits with optimised target regions and primer sequences (in the E gene and SARS-CoV-2-specific S gene) ruled out the unspecific signals completely. Hence, reasons for the observed unspecific signals may be dimerisation of primers and probes and/or unspecific primer binding and polymerase activity in the targeted region of the E gene, probably also depending on thermal profile and cycler-specific differences, or most likely a combination of these factors.",

Sample preparation and RNA extraction took place in a second room. Sample RNA was added in a third room under a PCR hood. The synthetic E gene control was added last to the mastermix. All reagents were aliquoted and aliquots used once only. Contaminations from synthetic E gene present in primer batches upon delivery can be ruled out as well, although only one batch of E gene primers and probes was used with the QuantiTect and Superscript III setup, as only a certain proportion of samples showed the unspecific signals. Furthermore, the unspecific signals were significantly reduced in the Superscript III setup, which showed that its sensitivity was comparable to the QuantiTect setup. In addition, the initially used E gene primers and probe were separately used as templates with the RealStar kit and no amplification was observed, whereas the corresponding artificial E gene template delivered a clear S-shaped curve with this kit.",

The RealStar kit outperformed the two other tested one-step PCR systems in sensitivity and by absence of unspecific signals with the used primer set and the RealStar workflow enhanced laboratory efficiency combining two coronavirus assays (lineage B CoV and specific SARS-CoV-2) with an IC in a triplex PCR. Overall, fast assay development and publication of protocols by expert laboratories allowed public health laboratories to establish diagnostics quickly and act fast. Assay optimisation will further speed up and improve the management of this ongoing outbreak.",
