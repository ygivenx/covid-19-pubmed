We used HuH7 cells because EBOV infections in humans induce the majority of their histopathological features in the liver, and these cells are highly susceptible to filovirus infections20. We used immortalized cells because primary cells from bats (macrophages and dendritic cells) are not available in the large quantities we required for our RNA-Seq analyses (9 samples from each cell type). Our analyses consisted of computational and extensive manual investigations as shown in Fig. 2. At 3, 7 and 23 h p.i., cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These time points correspond to the different stages of the viral replication cycle (Fig. 3). Replication and transcription take place after 3 h, proteins are produced at 7 h, which may regulate further transcription, and a complete replication cycle occurs after 23 h. DNaseI digestion was performed. At each time point, RNA was also isolated from non-infected (Mock) control cells. Quality controls were performed to ensure proper infection rates and viral propagation. Real-time PCR was used to detect filovirus RNA (polymerase genes)21 and to demonstrate the amplification of viral RNA over the time course of the infections (Fig. 1B). Ct-values are inversely proportional to the amount RNA detected, and these values for the MARV-infected HuH7 cells at 3 and 7 h p.i. were lower than the values for the MARV-infected R06E-J cells. The Ct-values for the EBOV-infected cells showed no clear difference. An immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of the cells was performed using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against nucleoproteins of EBOV (B6C5, 1:20) and MARV (59-9-10, 1:100). An anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled with Alexa 594 (1:500) was used to detect these viral nucleoproteins, and DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining was used to visualize cell nuclei (1 mg/ml, 1:2000). IFAs of the MARV and EBOV nucleoproteins revealed that a MOI of 3 was sufficient to initially infect a high percentage of cells (90% of human and bat cells infected with EBOV, 70% of bat cells and 99% of human cells infected with MARV, Fig. 1C/D). The quantity and quality of the RNA was assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Nine samples at different time points were generated from human cells (HuH7-Mock-3h, HuH7-Mock-7h, HuH7-Mock-23h, HuH7-EBOV-3h, HuH7-EBOV-7h, HuH7-EBOV-23h, HuH7-MARV-3h, HuH7-MARV-7h, HuH7-MARV-23h) and bat (R06E-J-Mock-3h, R06E-J-Mock-7h, R06E-J-Mock-23h, R06E-J-EBOV-3h, R06E-J-EBOV-7h, R06E-J-EBOV-23h, R06E-J-MARV-3h, R06E-J-MARV-7h, R06E-J-MARV-23h).",

We denoted these filtered subsets as expressed and blasted (E-value < 10\u221210) them against the de novo transcriptome assemblies of the human or bat cells. We defined a transcript (derived from the genomic sequence) as valid, and therefore correctly assembled, if we obtained a minimum of one blast hit with an alignment length >90% of the query. For the human transcriptome assembly, we found between 93.0% and 98.1% of the expressed transcripts, and for R. aegyptiacus 81.3\u201394.0%. Therefore, the transcriptome assemblies were of sufficient quality. The results for different transcript subsets are shown in Table S3. Most of the missing transcripts can be explained by a low read coverage in comparison to the length of the transcript or a non-uniform distribution of reads along the transcript. These transcripts may be assembled as partial contigs (alignment length \u226490%).

RNA synthesis slowed down in both species in the subsequent 16 h (Fig. 3), and transcript levels were nearly identical at 23 h p.i. (Table S2). The EBOV and MARV viral proteins were more abundant in HuH7 than in R06E-J cells at 7 h p.i. and were present at similar levels at 23 h p.i. (Fig. 1C,D) as determined using IFAs. Early increases in the levels of viral RNA and proteins in HuH7 cells may be attributed to a faster rate of early replication of filoviruses in HuH7 cells compared to the rate in R06E-J cells. The differences in replication velocities may contribute to the different susceptibilities of HuH7 cells and R06E-J cells to filovirus infection. However, it does not explain which differences in the cellular regulatory response mechanisms are responsible for the higher RNA synthesis rate in HuH7 cells. We observed few regulatory effects at 3 and 7 h p.i. However, more than 1,670 genes were up- or down-regulated at 23 h p.i. in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells, whereas only 74 genes showed altered expression patterns in MARV-infected samples (Fig. 4A). Chemokine ligands (CXCL1 and CXCL5), transcription factors (e.g., FOSL1, FOS, FOSB, ATF3), and genes with diverse functions (e.g., PPP1R15A, dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs)) were among the 55 genes that were most strongly regulated after filovirus infections in HuH7 cells (log2FC > 5, Figure ES2A).

            "text": "Many transcription factors were found to be among the most differentially expressed genes. Therefore, we assume that they play an important role in the changes observed after filoviral infection. To identify the regulatory factors that are responsible for the observed transcriptional changes after filoviral infection in HuH7 cells, we performed motif activity response analyses with MARA47. MARA infers the regulatory impact (also called activity) of a regulatory motif from the changes in expression of the predicted downstream genes (targets) of that motif. For a curated collection of ~190 mammalian transcription factor binding motifs and ~90 miRNA seed families, we found 76 and 38 motifs with a change in activity (z-value > 1.5) in response to EBOV and MARV infections, respectively (see electronic supplement, Section ES5). Genes that are regulated by such motifs are involved in NF\u03baB signaling or cell-cycle regulation (Fig. 5). Interestingly, we found that the FOS/JUN -motif has significantly increased activity after both EBOV and MARV infections. This result indicates that genes having FOS/JUN -motif binding sites in their promoter region are primarily up-regulated (Fig. 5). Consistent with this, transcription factors that are associated with this motif (e.g., FOSB) were up-regulated in infected cells (Fig. 4B). The transcription factor AP1, a homo or heterodimer of differentially expressed FOS and JUN, plays important roles in different viral infections4849. Other motifs, such as the KLF12- and the NRF1-associated motifs (Fig. 5), are more specific to EBOV and MARV, respectively, reflecting the differences in the impacts of theses two viruses on the transcriptional landscape of infected cells. In summary, we found various motifs, including the antiviral signaling-associated motif for NF\u03baB, to have significant changes in activity (Fig. 5). For each motif, we provide associated regulators and target genes (Section ES5).",

The majority of genes involved in innate immune responses (from Kuri et al.50) were either not expressed in the human cell cultures examined here or were only slightly differentially regulated during infection (Table S11). Consistent with this observation, some of these genes (e.g., IFITM1/2, OAS1-3) are not included in our bat transcriptome assembly, suggesting they were not transcribed. However, we did observe significantly different RNA levels for several bat homologs of innate immune response genes in filovirus-infected R06E-J cells in comparison with their levels in HuH7 cells. For example, DDX58 and ADAR demonstrated lower, and NMI higher, expression levels in EBOV-infected R06E-J cells (Table S11). The differences in the mRNA concentrations of these transcripts in infected HuH7 and R06E-J cells may play a role in the defense mechanisms that are active during filovirus infections. Genes encoding for proteins initiating pathways known to respond to viral infections, such as DDX58 (Figure ES6.8), NF\u03baB (Figures ES6.10 and ES6.17), and MAPK pathways (Figures ES6.2\u20136.7), were not induced during filovirus infections in our study. Only those genes of the examined pathways that encode proteins that act as key players (see Fig. 4B,C) were up-regulated in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells relative to their expression in R06E-J cells.",

Although we observed differences between HuH7 and R06E-J cells in the levels of DDX58 and ISYNA1 mRNA, all but one gene (IKK\u03b5) related to the DDX58 pathway were expressed, but they were not differentially affected. We noted an up-regulation of the FOS (38X) and JUN (9X) genes in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells 23 h p.i. (Fig. 4B). We observed no significant change in the genes specific to the DDX58 pathway at the transcriptomic level. We therefore assume that regulation of the DDX58 pathway at the transcriptomic level is not a driving factor leading to the frequent fatalities observed in humans, which are not observed in bats, subsequent to filoviral infection.",

CYR61 was among the most up-regulated genes in HuH7 cells and was usually highly expressed at 3 and 23 h p.i., which correspond to the periods of inflammation and wound repair, respectively59 (Figure ES4C). The cytokine genes IL8 and IL32 responded in both MARV- and EBOV-infected HuH7 cells, showing a significant up-regulation (Fig. 4B). IL32 expression can be induced by IL8 and is involved in the apoptosis of T cells in EBOV-infected patients6061. It is also up-regulated in response to influenza A virus infections. The up-regulation of IL8 results in the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways6263. We identified NRAV up-regulation 7 h p.i. This long non-coding RNA was recently reported as a key regulator of antiviral innate immunity that acts via the suppression of interferon-stimulated gene transcription64. We propose that a cellular component exists, in addition to the filoviral inhibition of the innate immune system by VP24 and VP356566676869, that results in the same inhibition of innate immunity. At 23 h p.i. we identified several highly up- and down-regulated genes, which we were unable to categorize (see Section ES4). We also determined that ANXA3 was markedly up-regulated. Annexin A3 is an inhibitor of phospholipase A2 and possesses anti-coagulant properties70.",

Another important activity of PPP1R15A is the negative feedback control it exerts on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which regulates protein translation83. EIF2\u03b1 was not significantly differentially expressed in our samples (Figure ES6.12). Protein kinase R, which phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, was slightly up- and down-regulated in EBOV- and MARV-infected cells, respectively.

Upon EBOV invasion of the host cells, an antiviral response is induced, including the activation of NF\u03baB and MAPK. Genes of other innate immune response pathways (e.g., JAK/STAT, DDX58) are then suppressed. After EBOV infection, DUSPs are highly up-regulated in HuH7 cells, correlating with the down-regulation of MAPK8, MAPK1/3 and MAPK14 mRNA levels. When translated, these genes are responsible for the innate immune response89. PPP1R15A plays a central role by binding to the receptor TGFBR1 and inhibiting additional components of the innate immune system. Compared with HuH7 cells, R06E-J cells demonstrate almost no or only a very slight up-regulation of PPP1R15A and DUSPs, very likely leading to a stable antiviral response. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of all JAK/STAT pathway genes in R06E-J cells remain constant during EBOV-infection compared with the levels in HuH7 cells. The viral protein VP24 inhibits STAT1 activity in humans, blocking signaling into the nucleus. We suggest that a possible feedback loop exists that increases the number of IFNGR2 receptors in HuH7 cells. The robust expression of interferon-stimulated genes could orchestrate the antiviral response of the infected cell90.",

TLR3 is expressed at a greater level in R06E-J cells than in the human cell line, but was also not differentially expressed. These results support our RNA-Seq data. Interestingly, we observed differences in the melting curves for TLR3 and HAVCR1 (Figure ES7B), which could be due to differences in the amplified sequences of human and bat RNA as identical degenerate primers were used for the amplification of TLR3 from HuH7 and R06E-J cells.

(6) During the manual inspection, we identified the synonyms of gene names and noted their existence in the relevant pathways. Each candidate gene was manually investigated in the IGV and UCSC browsers for the human and bat samples from all time points. We report the conservation of genes according to the 100 Species Vertebrate Multiz Alignment to chimp, mouse, dog, elephant and chicken sequences. We searched for nucleotide modifications (differential SNPs, posttranscriptional modifications), intronic transcripts and regulators, alternative splicing and isoforms, and upstream and downstream transcript characteristics.",

The first replication cycle is finished after 15\u201318 h, when virions are released from the host cells. Host cells die between 2 to 7 days. Between 3 and 7 h p.i. of EBOV-infected R06E-J cells, we observed an ~4.8X increase in the number of reads that mapped uniquely to the EBOV genome. This indicates that EBOV genes are rapidly replicated and transcribed in the bat cells in the first 4 h p.i. (see Table S2 for normalized read counts). We observed a further 41X increase in reads between 7 and 23 h p.i. in R06E-J cells. So, this RNA synthesis rate slows down within this next 16 h (compared to 4.8X4 \u2243 530X). In comparison, unique reads mapping to the EBOV genome in HuH7 cells increased 15.6X between 3 and 7 h p.i. and a further 15.5X in the following 16 h. This result indicates a significant increase in the RNA synthesis rate of viral RNAs in the first few hours and a marked decrease in the following hours.",

At 23 h p.i., the number of regulated genes was higher (1,678) in EBOV-infected cells than in cells infected with MARV. Adding these ~1,600 strongly regulated genes to the findings from analyses comparing the different time points or viruses resulted in approximately 2,500 genes being identified as significantly differentially transcribed.

The input matrix is scaled within the rows to visualize changes in expression at the gene level. Fold changes are based on unique genome read counts of H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus. Genes without a clear homologous sequence in the R. aegyptiacus genome or transcriptome assembly are marked with a star. We identified homologous locations (LOC107508087, LOC107515336, LOC107498547) for three genes that were not directly annotated in the R. aegyptiacus genome (EP300, RPS17L, MX1).

We are not able to connect all genes (e.g. SKP2 inhibiting CDKN1B, CYCE and CDKN1A). We found seven members of the DUSP pathway (DUSP1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 16) being highly deregulated and involved in many interactions, mostly repressing MAPK8, MAPK1/MAPK3 and MAPK14.
