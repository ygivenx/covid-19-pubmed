            "text": "Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins regulate many cellular processes. Common PTMs include phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation. Viruses are well known for their ability to manipulate PTMs for their advantage, often encoding proteins that are able to add modifications (protein kinases, E3 ligases) or remove them (phosphatases, deubiquitinases) from proteins. ADP-ribosylation is a common but little-studied PTM whereby diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTDs) transfer ADP-ribose from NAD+ onto target proteins. ADP-ribose can be attached either as a single unit via mono-ADP-ribosylation (MAR) or as polymers via poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR). ARTDs have both antiviral and proviral effects on replication (reviewed in reference 1). In support of their antiviral roles, several ARTDs are induced by interferon (IFN) (2, 3); others enhance interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression (4, 5); and some are under positive selection, a hallmark of proteins involved in virus-host conflict (6, 7). Specific examples of antiviral ARTD1s include ARTD10, ARTD12, and ARTD14, which block alphavirus replication (2). Also, ARTD14 and ARTD12 have been demonstrated to modulate IFN and NF-\u03baB pathways, respectively (8, 9). Finally, ARTD13, known as zinc-antiviral protein (ZAP), is an inactive ARTD that has strong activity against a number of viruses (10).",

            "text": "Several proteins have been identified that regulate ADP-ribosylation by removing ADP-ribose from target proteins. These include PAR-glycohydrolases (PARG), ADP-ribosyl hydrolases (ARH), and macrodomain-containing proteins (reviewed in reference 11). A macrodomain is an evolutionarily conserved domain consisting of approximately 170 amino acids with a well-defined structure of central \u03b2-sheets flanked by \u03b1-helices (12, 13). They are present in all domains of life, and humans have 9 genes that encode macrodomain proteins. Many studies have shown that these domains bind to mono- or poly-ADP-ribose (MAR or PAR) and that several are able to hydrolyze ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032 phosphate, a by-product of tRNA splicing, to ADP-ribose (14, 15). Recently, these domains were shown to remove ADP-ribose from proteins and thus may play a key role in the regulation of protein ADP-ribosylation (16\u201318). Furthermore, as several ARTDs have been shown to have antiviral activity, macrodomains may inhibit these functions; however, this has not been experimentally demonstrated. Consistent with this idea, viruses from the Hepeviridae, Togaviridae, and Coronaviridae families all encode macrodomains. Originally, it was thought that these enzymes primarily act as ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphatases (ADRPs) or bind to PAR (14, 19\u201322), as these activities had been convincingly demonstrated in vitro. However, it was recently shown that macrodomains from hepatitis E virus (HEV) and SARS-CoV can deMARylate and dePARylate protein substrates in vitro (23), although no specific protein targets for viral macrodomains have been identified. No clear role for any potential macrodomain activity during infection has been identified, and no connection to innate immunity has been shown for ADR-1\u2032\u2032-phosphate or free ADP-ribose.",

In humans, CoVs were originally thought to cause only mild respiratory or gastrointestinal disease. Then, in 2002 to 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV emerged, spreading across multiple countries and causing a severe respiratory disease with a mortality rate of ~10% (24). In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged as another highly pathogenic CoV with a high mortality rate (25). In addition, a number of SARS-like CoVs are currently circulating in bats and are able to infect human cells, suggesting that a single zoonotic transmission event could set off another epidemic (26). Currently, there are no approved therapeutics or vaccines to treat human CoVs, and as such, increased research into further understanding CoV biology to identify therapeutic targets and novel vaccine strategies is needed to control these viruses.",

Using mutation of the highly conserved asparagine residue, which was shown to be essential for ADP-ribose-1\u2032-phosphatase activity in vitro (14), this domain was shown to be required for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) virulence in mice, despite only minor replication defects being associated with mutant viruses in vitro (19, 27). In the context of infection with the HKU-39849 strain of SARS-CoV, macrodomain mutation rendered virus highly sensitive to IFN, although this same phenotype was not shown in the MHV studies (19, 20, 27). That study also found increased levels of IFN and CXCL-10 in macrodomain mutant-infected 293 cells (20). The macrodomain has also been analyzed in other viruses. The Sindbis virus macrodomain was required for replication in neuronal cells and virulence in 2-week-old mice (28). Also, while the role of the macrodomain in HEV infection has not been specifically analyzed, it was shown to block interferon production when expressed in isolation (29). Taken together, those studies suggest that the viral macrodomains impact host innate immune pathways to promote disease. While it has been clearly demonstrated that the CoV macrodomain is essential for virulence in MHV, it remains unclear whether this domain is also critical for virulence in pathogenic human respiratory CoV infection. Here we used a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) that causes a lethal infection in BALB/c mice (30). We developed a series of recombinant viruses with mutations in the ADP-ribose binding pocket of the macrodomain, which we predicted would reduce or eliminate enzymatic activity, and confirmed this prediction in an in vitro deMARylation assay. We found that all of these mutant viruses were highly attenuated and unable to cause lung disease in mice, while in vitro replication was unaffected. In addition, we found that the catalytic activity of the macrodomain was required to repress cytokine expression both in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV macrodomain functions to suppress the expression of innate immune genes and promote virulence.",

            "text": "To determine the role of the SARS-CoV macrodomain (sMacro), we identified and then mutated several amino acids predicted to be involved in de-ADP-ribosylating proteins (Fig. 1A and B). The structure of the CoV macrodomain is well defined, and amino acids that line the ADP-ribose binding pocket have been identified (14, 22, 31). Furthermore, several amino acids in this pocket have been tested for ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) or O-acetyl-ADP-ribose deacetylase activity with either the SARS-CoV or other related macrodomain proteins (14, 15, 32). As the C1\u2032\u2032 atom of the distal ribose is attacked by ADRP as well as during the process of de-ADP-ribosylation, it is likely that the two types of enzymatic activity utilize the same or similar amino acids (16). Using 2-step Red recombination in concert with either galactose-kinase-mediated or homing endonuclease I-SceI-mediated negative selection (33, 34), we mutated the following amino acids in the SARS-CoV MA15 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (35): D1022A, N1040A, H1045A, and G1130V (Fig. 1A and B). N1040 and H1045 both interact with the terminal ribose through hydrogen bonding with a water molecule that ultimately makes a nucleophilic attack at the C1\u2032\u2032 atom of the terminal ribose (14, 31). Using bacterially expressed recombinant proteins, the H1045A mutation was shown to reduce but not eliminate ADRP activity, while the N1040A mutation completely eliminated ADRP activity (14). Importantly, the N1040 amino acid is universally conserved among enzymatically active macrodomains (15, 16). D1022 has been shown to provide critical hydrogen bonds with water molecules near the adenine ring, stabilizing this interaction (14, 22, 31). Finally, G1130 interacts with the distal phosphate group of ADP-ribose and has been shown to affect macrodomain catalytic activity (15, 32).",

Viral sequences were analyzed after 4 passages to determine if the mutations were stable. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of virus-infected cells followed by direct sequencing verified that all of the mutations were present after at least 4 passages (data not shown). Nsp3 was detected by Western blotting and was found to be in distinct cytoplasmic puncta at 48 h postinfection (hpi) following infection with each virus. None of the mutations had an effect on nsp3 localization, and only small differences in nsp3 protein levels were detected in some of the mutants (see Fig. S1A and B in the supplemental material). Finally, we created bacterially expressed recombinant macrodomain wild-type and mutant proteins using a previously published assay that tested their ability to deMARylate the ADP-ribosylated ARTD10 catalytic domain (ARTD10cd) in vitro (23). The macroH2A1.1 protein was utilized as a negative control as it does not contain de-ADP-ribosylating activity (16). The N1040A and G1130V macrodomain mutant proteins were unable to deMARylate ARTD10, while D1022A and H1045A retained a small amount of deMARylating activity compared to wild-type protein (Fig. 1C and D). This demonstrates that these amino acids in the ADP-ribose binding pocket are critical for the SARS-CoV macrodomain to deMARylate protein substrates.",

            "text": "It was previously shown by Kuri et al. that the SARS-CoV HKU-39849 strain N1040A mutant virus was more sensitive to IFN than wild-type virus in vitro (20). In contrast, the corresponding mutants in MHV did not have increased sensitivity to IFN (19, 27). To assess the IFN sensitivity of the MA15 N1040A virus, Vero E6 cells were pretreated with increasing amounts of alpha IFN (IFN-\u03b1) or IFN-\u03b2 and then infected with the MA15 wild-type strain and MA15-N1040A. IFN was retained on the cells for the duration of the experiment, and the cells and supernatants were analyzed at 48 hpi for viral titers and genomic RNA (gRNA) (Fig. S2A to C). Titers and gRNA levels for both viruses were reduced by about 2-logs following addition of 100 units of IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. S2B and C), but neither virus was affected by up to 1,000 units of IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. S2A). The differences in sensitivity to IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1 were consistent with previous reports (36). The differences in IFN sensitivity of N1040A virus between this study and that of Kuri et al. could be due to a variety of factors, including virus strain, types of IFN used, or second-site mutations that were not controlled for in the previous study (20). We conclude that the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV MA15 macrodomain is nonessential for virus replication or IFN resistance in vitro.",

Interestingly, nearly 100% of mice survived infection with mutant viruses completely devoid of deMARylating activity (N1040A and G1130V), while slightly fewer mice survived infection with mutant viruses that retained some deMARylating activity (D1022A and H1045A) (Fig. 1C; see also Fig. 3A and C). This suggests that virulence correlates with enzymatic activity. Histological analysis of the lungs at 5 days postinfection (dpi) found that wild-type-infected mice had large amounts of pulmonary edema in the lungs, while those of N1040A mutant virus-infected mice were devoid of edema (Fig. 3E). Since the disease phenotypes were similar in mice infected with all the mutant viruses, we used the N1040A mutant exclusively for all subsequent experiments.",

Previous studies have found extensive viral N protein staining around the airways and in the parenchyma with extensive N protein distribution in type II and, to a lesser extent, type I pneumocytes at 24 hpi (37, 38). Viral N protein was similarly distributed in lungs infected with wild-type or N1040A virus, but it appeared that less N protein was detected in N1040A-infected samples, consistent with the titer data (Fig. 4C).

Since N1040A infection results in a reduced viral load at 24 hpi that is concurrent with this increase in IFN production, we hypothesized that IFN may be responsible for reducing the viral load. To test this, we measured lung virus titers at 24 hpi in the absence of IFN-I signaling (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice). Surprisingly, infection of IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice with N1040A virus still resulted in an ~3-fold reduction in viral load at 24 hpi compared to infection with wild-type virus (Fig. S3). The reduction in virus load could be due to a cytokine that does not use the type I IFN receptor, such as IFN-\u03bb. Alternatively, it may suggest that the macrodomain promotes virus replication in vivo and suppresses cytokine expression independently or that it targets a protein that can separately affect the two processes.",

There were small but significant increases in the amount of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lung at these times, possibly reflecting increased expression of CXCL-10 and CCL2 in N1040A-infected mice (Fig. S4) (39, 40). However, at those early time points it is unlikely that these were virus-specific T cells, making their significance unclear.

We then tested whether this domain could block poly(I-C)- or poly(dA-dT)-induced expression of IFN-\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b1 (42). Poly(I-C) induces interferon by activating MDA5, while poly(dA-dT) activates RIG-I.

The sMacro protein was unable to block induction of IFN-\u03b2 or TNF by either method, while MERS-4a reduced these transcripts by ~3-fold, except in the case of poly(dA-dT)-induced TNF, where it had no effect (Fig. 6D).

These dually infected mice also had increased IFN and proinflammatory cytokine levels at 16 hpi that were comparable to the levels seen with N1040A-infected mice but titers identical to those seen with mice infected with the wild-type virus at 24 hpi (Fig. 7B and C). This suggests that an early innate immune response during coinfection protects mice without affecting virus replication. The protection was incomplete, as ~25% of mice did succumb to the coinfection compared to only ~5% after infection with N1040A virus only (Fig. 3A and 7A).

It was also required for optimal virus replication in vivo and cytokine repression both in vivo and in vitro. These results are consistent with reports demonstrating an important in vivo role for CoV macrodomains. Specifically, catalytic mutants with mutations of the macrodomain in murine MHV and in Sindbis virus were unable to cause severe hepatitis and encephalitis, respectively (19, 27, 28). However, in addition to demonstrating reduced replication in vivo, our results indicate a role for the conserved SARS-CoV macrodomain in suppressing the early IFN and proinflammatory cytokine response and promoting pathological changes, such as edema, in the lung and lethality in infected mice. Specifically, SARS-CoV N1040A, a virus devoid of macrodomain catalytic activity, induced significantly elevated expression levels of IFN, ISGs, and other cytokines at 16 to 24 hpi. Importantly, mice coinfected with both wild-type and N1040A had better outcomes and increased IFN and proinflammatory cytokine expression than mice infected with wild-type virus, despite the presence of similar virus titers at 24 hpi. This suggests that an early innate immune response plays an important role in protecting mice from lethal disease. However, dually infected mice were not completely protected from infection, suggesting that the ability of the macrodomain to augment virus load in vivo also plays a significant role in its ability to promote disease.",

We recently showed that a dysregulated IFN response enhanced virulence of SARS-CoV (37). SARS-CoV strongly represses IFN production initially following infection, and mice are completely protected from disease if exogenous IFN is given before peak replication, demonstrating an important role for early IFN-I production in protection. In the absence of exogenous IFN, IFN-I is rapidly produced at later times and recruits inflammatory monocytes to the lung. There, these monocytes produce additional proinflammatory cytokines, cause vascular leakage, and impair virus specific T-cell responses, ultimately leading to lethality (37). Consequently, SARS-CoV is unable to cause disease in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. It is currently unknown how an early IFN/cytokine response protects mice from SARS-CoV-mediated disease. Identifying the precise mechanism of cytokine-mediated protection from a lethal SARS-CoV infection will help us understand how the innate immune system responds to and protects animals from CoV infection.",

Until recently, it was thought that the primary role for the CoV macrodomain was to dephosphorylate ADR-1\u2032\u2032-phosphate, a by-product of tRNA splicing, to ADR (14, 19\u201322, 31). Hence, it was primarily referred to as an ADRP (ADPR-1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase). However, this intermediate has never been detected during a CoV infection, and there is no known connection between ADR-1\u2032\u2032-phosphate or ADR and the innate immune system. Therefore, we believe it is much more likely that the CoV macrodomain acts as a de-MAR/PARylating enzyme than as an ADRP, and future efforts will be devoted to identifying its target protein(s).",

At this time, a few ADP-ribosylated proteins involved in innate immunity have been identified. It was recently shown that ARTD14, also known as Ti-PARP, ADP-ribosylated TBK-1, which led to inhibition of the IFN response (9). ARTD12 has been shown to localize to stress granules and interact with TRIF. Furthermore, its catalytic activity enhances NF-kB-dependent gene expression and blocks both host and virus translation during alphavirus infection (8, 50). Also, ARTDs located in stress granules are able to ADP-ribosylate Argonaute proteins, which leads to blocking of RNA interference (RNAi), leading to the increased translation of ISGs (4, 5). Finally, ARTD15 was shown to ADP-ribosylate PERK and IRE1\u03b1, 2 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensors required for the induction of the unfolded-protein response (UPR) (51). ARTDs are also auto-ADP-ribosylated, which may impact their specific interactions with proteins in these pathways, making them potential macrodomain targets as well. As ARTDs are often found in stress granules, it will be of interest to determine if nsp3 localizes to these sites, in addition to replication compartments.",

Recently, two influenza A virus proteins, PB2 and PA, were shown to be PARylated and targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation when overexpressed. This degradation was countered by the coexpression of the PB1 protein of influenza A virus, explaining why this degradation does not occur during infection (52). As the SARS-CoV macrodomain was unable to block cytokine expression in isolation, it is possible that it removes antiviral ADP-ribosylation from SARS-CoV proteins. Furthermore, nsp3 is a transmembrane protein mostly localized within virus replication complexes, which may limit its access to ADP-ribosylated cellular proteins. While several viral proteins could be targeted by the macrodomain, likely targets include the PLpro domain of nsp3, which is located in close proximity to the macrodomain and contains deubiquitinase activity that can repress innate immune signaling (reviewed in reference 53), and the N protein, which binds to nsp3 and is also able to block innate immune signaling in overexpression (54, 55). Experiments are under way to identify specific protein targets of the SARS-CoV macrodomain.",
