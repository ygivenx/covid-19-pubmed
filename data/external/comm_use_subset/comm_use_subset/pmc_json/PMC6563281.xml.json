However, the sequences generated by these instruments are almost always considerably shorter in length than the genomic regions studied. Genomic analyses often begin with the process of sequence assembly, where sequence fragments (reads) are reconstructed into the larger sequences from which they originated. Computational methods play a vital role in the assembly of short reads, and a variety of assemblers and related tools have been developed in tandem with emerging sequencing platforms [6]. All subsequent analyses and investigations depend upon the quality, accuracy and speed of this crucial sequence assembly process. ",

The use of a reference sequence, even the use of a data specific generated sequence, can lead to valuable read information being discarded during the alignment process [15]. On the other hand, while de novo approaches require little a priori knowledge of target sequence composition, the methods are computationally intensive, and their performance scales poorly with datasets of increasing size [9]. Aggressive heuristics must be employed, to traverse graphs and deal with mismatches, reduce the running time of de novo assemblers, which, in turn, can compromise assembly quality. Indexing structures such as the BWT and its relatives are widely used to reduce the burden of pairwise sequence comparison, for both reference-based mapping and de novo assembly. However, they cannot process mismatches within reads, necessitating the use of computationally expensive heuristics to establish relationships between divergent sequences. Increasing sequence length further affects the performance of these approaches [16].",

For biologists working on outbreak responses or pathogen discovery, both the accuracy of the assembly results and the speed of sequence analyses (e.g., assembly, alignment and pathogen classification) are crucial for crisis response and management. The ability to run analyses in the field on portable computer systems without internet connectivity is also important.

Data transform/approximation techniques include the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [17], the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [18,19] and piece-wise aggregate approximation (PAA) [20,21]. The DFT or DWT are used to transform data to their frequency domains, allowing feature extraction [22], and PAA is used as a data approximation approach. In data-intensive fields, data transformations/approximations are commonly used as dimensionality reduction approaches for obtaining fast approximate solutions for a given problem. Due to the ordered nature of genetic data, many of these transformation approaches can be applied to sequences of nucleotides [23] or amino acids [24]. An example of a successful implementation of a Fourier transform in computational biology is the multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform alignment algorithm MAFFT [25] where the physiochemical properties of amino acids are used to represent sequences for fast matching of homologous sequence regions for alignment. Since most transformation approaches are suitable only for numerical sequences, the strings of letters representing genetic sequences must be mapped into numerical space using a numerical sequence representation method [26].

Euclidean distance is arguably the most widely used Lp-norm method for sequential data comparison but can only be used on sequences of the same length. Furthermore, Lp-norm methods do not accommodate shifts in the x-axis (time or position) and are thus limited in their ability to identify similar features within offset data. Elastic similarity/dissimilarity methods, such as LCS, unbounded DTW and various alignment algorithms, permit comparison of data with different dimensions and tolerate shifts in the x-axis. These properties of elastic similarity methods can be very useful in the analysis of speech signals, for example, but can be computationally expensive [30]. Several approaches have been proposed to permit fast searching with DTW, including the introduction of global constraints (wrapping path) or the use of lower bounding techniques, such as LB_keogh [28].

Metric space indexing structures make use of geometric properties for partitioning data and work efficiently on both low and high dimensional data [39]. The curse of dimensionality can be further mitigated using data approximations, such as the DFT, the DWT and the PAA, to partition a dataset in an approximated space without loss of generality [21].",

In the case of simulated data, information concerning the position of the read on the reference and alignment direction can be used to establish the correctness of alignment, and thereby provide a more informative F-measure score. Unclassified reads are considered a false negative result. Any reported match to the correct region of the genome in the correct direction is considered a true positive result. However, if the alignment position or direction information is unavailable, the F-measure can be calculated from the number of hits reported for a read, or the absence of a hit. Again, unclassified reads are considered false negative results, and classified reads are considered true positive results. In the case of mixed genome data, the F-measure score can be calculated by taking into consideration the number of hits that are reported for a read, as well as if a read is assigned to a reference genome from the same family. If a read is assigned to a genome from a different virus family, it is considered a false positive result, while unclassified reads are considered a false negative result.",

The implementation was developed to evaluate our methodology but was not optimised for speed. Users might specify parameters, such as the representation method, transformation method, search stringency and the k-mer length. A VP-tree indexing structure classified reads using a given set of genomic references. VP-tree construction began with the extraction of all unique k-mers, of a user-specified length k, from the set of supplied reference genomes. Each unique k-mer was represented in numerical sequence and then transformed into a lower dimensional space. The transformed data were then used to generate the VP-tree indexing structure. Subsequently, each short read from a query set was converted into numerical space, transformed to a lower dimensional space and evaluated against the VP-tree. The approximate solution arising from this was then evaluated using the original data to identify false positive matches. The CBN algorithm generated two output files. The first output was a text file providing detailed information on all of the classification matches generated for each read, including the reference name, the direction in which the query read was aligned to the reference, the start and end position of the query on the reference, the alignment score, the CIGAR string describing how the read aligns with the reference and the actual alignment of the query read on the reference genome. The second tabular output file provided a brief overview of the alignment. Each line contained the name of the read, the number of classifications generated for that particular read, the highest classification score obtained, the name of the reference, which provided the highest classification score, the alignment direction and starting position on the reference.",

Note, preliminary results have been presented as a conference paper [59]. Figure 10 illustrates the main concept of our de novo assembly approach. For the ASBN tool, reads are represented as numerical sequences using an appropriate numerical representation method (Table 1). Here, we used the tetrahedron numerical representation. Every k-mer of each numerically represented read was identified and transformed to lower dimensional space using the chosen transformation method. All k-mers\u2019 transformations were used to build a VP-tree, to allow for fast data comparison. Afterwards, all k-mers were compared to the rest of the data using the VP-tree index. Information from the data comparison was used to construct a weighted graph similar to that shown in Figure 10A. The shortest path on the weighted graph was identified with a breadth-first search (BFS) (Figure 10B). Reads overlaps were used to generate an OLC alignment of short reads (Figure 10C).",

While the problem of read alignment to a known reference sequence is largely considered solved, assembly of large genomes remains a formidable problem in computing. Moreover, consideration of the metagenomic composition of mixed biological samples, as demonstrated, further extends the scope and scale of the assembly problem beyond what is tractable using conventional sequence comparison approaches. By implementing a reference-based aligner and de novo assembler, we have demonstrated that using compressed numerical representations offers a versatile approach for reconstructing genomes and metagenomes sequenced with short reads.",

Whilst the error rate of Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform, for example, has decreased considerably since the technology\u2019s introduction [70,71], the relatively high error rate still limits the scope of downstream analyses [72]. Efficient algorithmic approaches are needed to (1) identify sequence identity/infer homology in spite of abundant insertion/deletion errors associated with the platform, which are problematic for approaches dependent on exact subsequence matching and (2) to overcome issues relating to high data dimensionality and the curse of dimensionality [73]. Both in terms of the raw electric current traces generated by DNA translocation through a nanopore and the corresponding base-called sequences, the resemblance between long reads and time series data from other fields is striking, such that the various transformations/approximations we have implemented will be directly applicable.",
