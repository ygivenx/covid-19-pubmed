Using heterologous sera in humans had its own limitations because of immunological reactions to serum proteins, for example, hypersensitivity. With the help of techniques for better purification of antibodies and monoclonal antibody (mAb) engineering, we now have overcome many of these complications and have attained improved specificity. Till recently, the main focus of the use of the recombinant mAb and passive immunotherapy had been for treatment of cancers or inflammatory conditions [1, 2].",

            "text": "MAb-based immunotherapy is becoming important in infectious diseases because of widespread resistance to drugs among pathogens, immunocompromised hosts, and the emergence of new pathogens. For controlling pathogens such as acute cytopathic viruses that can cause fatal damage in infected tissues, the best way is to prevent the disease. As vaccination is not always available or suitable, passive immunotherapy could be used to provide protection in the periods of high-exposure risk [3]. As immunotherapy is a promising approach to combat virus infection, much research efforts have been devoted to the generation and characterisation of virus-neutralizing mAbs [4\u20136]. In many laboratories, hybridoma clones are derived from mouse or rat B-lymphocytes by fusion with myeloma cell line (e.g., SP2/0, NS0, NS1, Ag8, or P3U1) [7]. One major limitation of using these hybridoma-derived mAbs is that human-anti-mouse or human-anti-rat antibody response can occur as a result of immunogenicity of these mouse or rat antibodies [4]. Therefore, it is important to humanize these antibodies for human therapeutic purposes without impacting their binding affinity towards antigen targets. For example, in virus research, after a mouse mAb is selected for its potent virus neutralizing activity, it will be useful to convert it into human-mouse chimeric form. If the human-mouse chimeric form has similar neutralizing activity; this will be a reason for further development for therapeutic application. Hence, the technique for converting mouse mAb into human-mouse chimeric form is an emerging research tool.",

For example, chimeric anti-human DR5 MAb (cmDRA6) can bind to DR5 antigen as demonstrated by both ELISA and Western blot [10]. In addition, a human-mouse chimeric antibody generated from mAb against hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid proteins E2 still maintains binding activity similar to the original mAb as shown by ELISA and Western blot [11]. Since chimeric antibody is expected to be less immunogenic in human, it could be suitable for antibody therapy of viral infections. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that patient, who received chimeric antibody 17-1A, did not show any toxic or allergic reactions and the chimeric antibody appears significantly less immunogenic than its parental murine antibody [13]. The construction of human-mouse chimeric antibody basically involves cloning and ligating of the variable region genes of mouse mAbs into expression vectors, which have heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin constant regions. A simple methodology for this conversion will be described here in a step-by-step manner.",

To obtain first-strand cDNA for PCR reaction, messenger RNA (mRNA) needs to be extracted from hybridoma cells before reverse transcription. The success to obtain a correct sequence for each V\nH and V\nL mainly depends on the selection of primer set and optimised conditions of PCR reaction. Different primer sets have been developed for amplifying the variable domains [14\u201317]. Mouse Ig-Primer set is also commercially available. For example, the one from Novagen has been successfully applied in many previous studies (e.g., [18\u201321]).",

In most of the clones, an identical sequence should be obtained.

An example of the latter is the pair of pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk vectors from InvivoGen. Expression of the human-mouse chimeric antibody is achieved by transfecting the vectors into a transfectable mammalian cell line like the Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK 293). The secreted antibody can then be purified from the culture supernatant and tested to determine if it still retains the antigen-binding capacity after chimerization. A direct comparison with the mouse monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma will reveal if there is any incompatibility between the mouse variable and human constant regions in the mouse-human chimeric antibody.",

Keep bacteria in LB broth at 4\u00b0C for short-term storage (2\u20134 weeks).Cut recombinant plasmid (5\u201310 \u03bcL) by FastDigest restriction enzymes and run the DNA gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of DNA insert.Optional step: sequence the DNA insert in the recombinant plasmid using BigDye Terminator v3.1.Grow bacteria with correct recombinant plasmid in LB broth with appropriate antibiotic (25 \u03bcg mL\u22121 zeocin or 50 \u03bcg mL\u22121 blasticidin S HCl) up to 16 hours at 37\u00b0C.

If using Oligo (dT) primer to produce the first-strand cDNA, the Novagen 3\u2032 primer must be added in PCR reaction.Decrease the annealing temperate by steps of two degrees if no PCR products are found. Increase the annealing temperature by steps of two degrees if many non-specific PCR products are found.Multiple bands may be present on DNA gel per reaction but purify DNA from band of expected size only (approximately 500 bp). Depending on hybridoma source, two PCR products for V\nL region may be obtained since one is from myeloma cells [24].Alternatively, IgBLAST can be used to verify correct sequence of V\nH and V\nL (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/index.html).Restriction sites introduced to forward and reverse primers for amplifying V\nH are chosen based on restriction sites of pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, including EcoRI, EcoRV, XhoI, and NheI. Restriction sites introduced to forward and reverse primers for amplifying V\nL are chosen based on restriction sites of pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, including EcoRI, AgeI, BstEII, NcoI, and BsiWI. Avoid choosing the restriction site if it is also found within V\nH or V\nL sequence because short fragment of V\nH or V\nL after digestion can be ligated into the vector.Other molar ratios of insert DNA to vector, such as 5 : 1 and 1 : 1, can also be performed at the same time.After overnight growth, HEK 293-FT cells should be around 80\u201390% confluent for optimal transfection.Since the HEK 293-FT cells can be easily dislodged, the media should be gently aspirated and added to the same edge side of the dish.The following protocol can be alternatively used to purify antibody from cell culture supernatant using HiTrap Protein G HP column: \nattach HiTrap Protein G HP 1 mL column to a peristaltic pump and equilibrate by passing through 10\u201320 mL PBS at flow rate of less than 2 mL per minute,filter the culture supernatant through 0.45 \u03bcm filter to remove any cell debris and dilute the filtrate with one volume of PBS,pass the diluted filtrate and then 10\u201320 mL PBS through the HiTrap column at flow rate of 1 mL per min,elute antibody using elution buffer 0.05 M Glycine-HCl, pH 2.7,collect and check pH of each 0.5 mL fraction,add 2.5 \u03bcL of 5 M NaOH for fraction with pH at around 2.7 to return pH to 7-8.\n\n",
