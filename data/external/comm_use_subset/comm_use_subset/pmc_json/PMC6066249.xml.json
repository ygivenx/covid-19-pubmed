A community influenza burden assessment in England found that approximately 18% of the unvaccinated population became infected with influenza A or B viruses each season during 2006\u20132011.[3] Although three-quarters of the infections in this population were asymptomatic,[3] symptoms and complications are often more severe among well recognized high-risk groups. For example, the hospitalization rate due to respiratory illness during an influenza season in Japan was 4.3 times higher among pregnant women than among those who were not pregnant.[4]",

Additionally, we attempted to model the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine through a case-test negative design, however, we did not have the statistical power to test this by year.
