Pecking at flock-mates can roughly be divided into gentle feather pecking, severe feather pecking and cannibalism [6]. According to research, gentle feather pecking is most common at a younger age, while severe feather pecking [7,8] and cannibalism occur more among older birds [8].",

It is possible to reduce pecking problems through genetic selection [11,12], which have also been connected with fearfulness of birds [9,13,14]. Feeding related issues may be linked to pecking problems and changing diets more often increases the risk for feather pecking [15,16]. Providing pelleted feed appears to increase the risk for feather pecking, whereas mash feeding reduces the risk [17,18]. Higher fibre content in the diet decreases cannibalism [19].",

Pecking-related problems are more common in aviary systems, deep litter systems and enriched cages compared with traditional cages [1,2]. On the other hand, aviary systems seem to be less risky compared with a floor system, probably because multiple tiers in aviary systems offer greater possibilities for pecked birds to escape the peckers [14]. In addition to production system, management competence is also involved [2]: litter condition [8,14], light intensity [9,14], stocking density [20], temperature and humidity [16] greatly influence pecking behaviour.",

The procedure appears to be efficient, because pecking-related problems are more common, and feather condition is worse among birds with intact beaks compared with beak-trimmed birds [7,19,29,30]. Nonetheless, these misbehaviours also exist in beak-trimmed flocks [7,8,15,24] and, thus, beak trimming fails to completely prevent pecking-related problems. Furthermore, beak trimming has negative consequences on the natural behaviour of the bird: beak-trimmed hens exhibit less ground pecking [29] and preening [31], and the procedure is painful [32]. Neuroma formation on the tip of the trimmed beak can also lead to long-term pain [32]. The cause of pecking problems is not the beak, as such: feather pecking and cannibalism arise due to various stressors [1,9]. Beak trimming, therefore, does not solve the underlying problem but only addresses the consequence. Therefore, raising intact-beaked hens is an integral part of sustainable egg production.",

It might be that at around peak production the problems typically start, and the starting point requires more effort to get the situation under control. Even if the problem continues thereafter, the farmers may not consider it to be such a severe problem any longer. The stress caused by transport from the rearing farm to the laying farm can initiate cannibalistic pecks, which might be one reason for the perceived risky stage being early in production [39].

Despite the given definitions for feather pecking and cannibalism, the estimation of individual respondents probably varied considerably. Indeed, in free comments, one respondent admitted having difficulties identifying the connection between feather cover condition and pecking problems. Farmers may consider poor feather cover in older hens as a normal course of a hen\u2019s life without realizing that it might be due to feather pecking. Surely, feather pecking is not the only factor affecting feather condition towards the end of production period, but it most probably is partly responsible for the situation. Also, small skin lesions caused by cannibalistic pecking could have remained undetected by farmers because this would have required picking up hens for thorough investigation. We did not ask or advise farmers to perform such a detailed examination and, most probably, the estimation was thus based on an approximate scanning during routine flock checking.",

Feeding and drinking equipment and inadequate access to feeders increases feather pecking [15]. Changing diets more often over the rearing period [16], or during laying [15], increases the likelihood of feather pecking during the production period. Among Finnish farmers, however, changing diets got a moderately low mean score (4.9) compared with other feeding-related issues. We cannot make further conclusions about that matter because we did not ask how many times the diet was changed on the responding farms. Feed form and composition also impact feather-pecking behaviour in laying hens. Mash feeding reduces feather pecking, probably because it increases time spent eating and encourages foraging behaviour better than when feed is in a pelleted form [17,18]. Diets with higher fibre content are associated with lower mortality resulting from cannibalism [19].",

Risk of pecking problems varies according to production system. In enriched cages, pecking-related behaviour is less frequent than in floor and aviary systems [2]. An aviary system seems to be less risky compared with a floor system, probably because the multiple tiers in aviary systems offer more possibilities for pecked birds to escape the peckers [14]. In a free-range system, feather pecking is less frequent, and plumage condition appears better, whereas cannibalism, in form of vent pecking, occurs more commonly [42].

A house temperature of less than 20 \u00b0C is associated with a higher risk of feather pecking [15]. In Finland, modern hen houses are typically equipped with heating and ventilation systems [44] that better ensure uniform temperature. Under summer heat, maintaining house temperatures at optimal levels is challenging. This explains why hot summer weather was associated with a high mean.

The same survey also established a connection between parasites and pecking problems [15] that was also considered an important risk factor in the current study (mean for ectoparasites 5.4 and for endoparasites 5.2). Immune responses induced by vaccinations or infections are related to increased feather pecking [46]. In most countries, laying hens are heavily vaccinated. However, the poultry disease situation in Finland remains relatively good [47] and, therefore, also the vaccination programme is modest compared with those in most European countries. For example, in Finland, laying hens are not vaccinated against IB or Newcastle disease. We could argue that the good health situation, and consequent minimal vaccination programme, lowers the risk for pecking problems in Finnish circumstances.",

Signs of feather or skin damage in transported pullets were, however, only seldom (20, 57% of the responses) or never (15, 43% responses) observed.

However, the practical experience of Finnish egg producers supports several previous studies outlining the importance of rearing period on pecking problems during the laying period. Chicks at a young age can express all manner of pecking behaviour, including severe feather pecking [5,14,16] and cannibalism [4]. If the birds have adopted a feather-pecking habit during rearing, the flock is at a higher risk of feather pecking during the laying period [4,5,14,16,41], making it important to prevent pecking problems already at a young age. Enriching the rearing environment with litter material, to allow foraging, reduces pecking problems during the laying period [4,14,16,23,28]. Furthermore, offering a perching opportunity at a young age, before four weeks, reduces the risk of vent pecking [14,28].",

Foraging and scratching bedding depend on age and available material; young chicks prefer wood shavings while, over time, birds start to express more interest towards sand [51]. Litter is of little value in enriched cages, compared with floor systems, and that most likely explains the low mean in this study. However, also in enriched cages, foraging possibility improves plumage condition [52]. Green et al. (2000) [15] observed a higher risk for feather pecking when friable litter was absent at the end of the production period. The study of de Jong et al.

The nest design may affect feather pecking. A questionnaire among egg producers in the UK suggested that offering communal nests for hens increases the likelihood of feather pecking [15]. Another study found that darkness in the nests reduces the incidence of feather pecking [44].",

Straw bales were not used in 63% farms, 74% had no experience of pecking stones, and 63% had not used hanging strings, and 54% other types of hanging object, as enrichment.

Several factors mentioned in their list were similar to those Finnish farmers referred to. Dimming lights was the most common factor in both questionnaires, as was the use of red lights, removing peckers and providing additional salt.
