The following clinical and laboratory features obtained on admission or that relate to discharge outcome were compared between influenza-positive and influenza-negative children: duration of hospitalization >14 days, very severe pneumonia, wheezing, hypoxia (oxygen saturation level <90%, by fingertip pulse oximetry), circulatory shock (capillary refill time \u22653 seconds), severe anemia (hemoglobin level <5 g/dL), prematurity, congenital heart disease, positivity for HIV antibody (by 2 rapid tests), severe underweight (weight for age Z score \u22643), slide positivity for Plasmodium species, bacteremia, concurrent viral infection diagnosis, and death before discharge [2]. Outpatient recruits were a convenience sample of children aged <13 years, enrolled for broad comparison with hospital-admitted patients, who presented with either no signs of acute respiratory infection (non-ARI) or signs of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) [2, 5]. Individuals with URTI had 1 or more of the following: cough, difficulty breathing, nasal discharge, runny or blocked nose, or sore throat.

Diagnostic screening for viral targets was performed using real-time RT-PCR. For specimens from KDH inpatients in 2007 and from outpatients in 2007\u20132008, reactions were tested by multiplex real-time RT-PCR, using FRET hybridization probes as described by Lassauni\u00e8re et al [6], with primers and probe targeting NS1 of influenza A virus and nucleoprotein of influenza B virus. All other samples were screened using the Taqman Qiagen Quantifast multiplex method on the ABI 7500 platform described by Hammitt et al, targeting the matrix protein for influenza A and C viruses and targeting NS for influenza B virus [3]. Concurrent targets in both RT-PCR assays included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1\u20133, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus (CoV 229e, NL69, and OC43), and, differentially by assay, coronavirus Hong Kong [6] and PIV4 [3].",

The incidence of influenza among inpatients for age group i, I(i), per 100 000 population per year was estimated on the basis of the equation I(i) = [C(i)/N(i)p(i)].100,100, where C(i) is the average number of children per year admitted who were resident in the KHDSS in age group i, N(i) the midsurvey KHDSS population in age group i, and p(i) is the proportion of eligible children tested for influenza (ie, we assumed that children who were not tested would have had the same prevalence of influenza as those who were tested and scaled the incidence accordingly). For pneumonia incidence estimates, p(i) is set to 1. The KDHSS population on 1 January 2009 was estimated to be 9451 individuals aged <1 year, 45 644 aged <5 years, and 108 708 aged <13 years. The population size and incidence estimation procedures have been described elsewhere [4]. The incidence estimation for the population proximal to the hospital was undertaken using cases involving children aged <5 years admitted from administrative sublocations within a 5-km radius of the hospital and the corresponding midpoint population estimate from the KHDSS (12 339 as of 1 January 2009). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare median ages; the \u03c72 or Fisher exact test was used to compare proportions, as appropriate; the Score test (procedure tabodds) was used to assess the trend in prevalence, by age; and the Poisson probability distribution was used to assess whether observed cases of influenza in specified quarters of the year exceeded the expected number of cases. Spearman rank correlation was used to test for a temporal association between monthly or quarterly numbers of influenza cases or influenza A virus infections and the number of cases of bacteremia or Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The analysis was undertaken with cases of influenza and bacteremia temporally in phase or between 1 and 4 months time step out of phase. The association between positivity for any influenza type and laboratory or clinical features on admission was assessed using logistic regression, adjusted for age group, to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).",

Influenza A virus predominated, with identification in 3.5% of inpatients and 3.3% of outpatients with URTI. Correspondingly, relative to the incidence of severe or very severe pneumonia among hospitalized children aged <5 years (1323 cases per 100 000 per year), the incidences of influenza (64 cases per 100 000 per year) and influenza A virus infection (46 cases per 100 000 per year) were low. There was near absence of influenza in the convenience sample of children without signs of respiratory illness. Our inpatient data are consistent with the results of a recent review of data on seasonal influenza from 15 published studies in sub-Saharan Africa [1], which reported a median prevalence of 6.0% among hospitalized pediatric patients, with a range of 0%\u201316%. In the same review, the median prevalence of influenza among outpatients with ARI was higher than we found, at 10% (range, 1%\u201325%; 11 studies), but comparisons should be cautioned because of a number of methodological differences. Exploration of a range of severity features and concurrent illnesses revealed hypoxia to be more commonly associated with influenza among hospitalized children.",

During the study period, A(H1N1)pdm09 entered Kenya [12], and cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were identified in KDH from late 2010. It is possible that the introduction of A(H1N1)pdm09 disrupted the normal pattern of A(H3N2) activity in 2010; only A(H1N1)pdm09 was observed in the latter quarters of 2010. Continued surveillance will reveal whether A(H1N1)pdm09 has any long-term effect on the circulation patterns of other influenza subtypes. However, in general, the contribution of A(H1N1)pdm09 to the burden of hospitalization-associated pneumonia was minimal in this setting. The possibility exists that the burden of influenza was underestimated because of associated, but delayed, invasive bacterial disease. However, we identified no evidence for an increased number of admissions in which bacteria (or S. pneumoniae, in particular) were detected in blood cultures during the quarter following peak occurrences of influenza.",

The reasons for this have been previously described [2, 4] and were primarily due to parental refusal and, to a lesser extent, to discharge or death before sampling. Failure to recruit and test was more common for critically ill children and for those who died while in the hospital. This almost certainly led to an underestimation of severity associated with influenza. A further limitation of the study is that results are based only on nasopharyngeal samples, and we now have definitive evidence that an oropharyngeal swab specimen provides added diagnostic value for detecting influenza in our setting (22% increased detection; 95% CI, 9\u201342), compared with nasopharyngeal specimens alone [3]. The low prevalence of influenza viruses in this study limits the power of the analysis to identify associations between virus presence and specific clinical features or coinfections. Our study involved sampling of 2000 children; a definitive investigation of clinical associations will require a considerably larger sample size or a location with a markedly higher incidence of influenza A virus infection. We report very low prevalence of influenza in outpatient children without signs of acute respiratory infection, suggesting that influenza virus is rarely the cause of asymptomatic infection, and the data also suggest influenza is the cause of only 4% of URTI cases. Further interpretation of these data with regard to the association between influenza and severe disease is unwarranted since outpatient sampling was not contemporaneous throughout the period of surveillance of hospitalized patients, and collection was not frequency matched by age and location within the KHDSS. We therefore await the complete results of a larger and better-designed case-control study, which is ongoing.",

A seasonal signature for influenza was evident, but no temporal association was identified with invasive bacterial disease. Although A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was observed, its contribution to disease was not substantial. Hypoxia was more frequently identified among patients with influenza, and immunosuppression, severe malnutrition, or chronic heart disease were identified in all of the 4 influenza-associated deaths. Given the low influenza prevalence, larger studies are required to investigate associations between influenza and disease severity or prevalent conditions, such as malaria, HIV infection, or malnutrition. Additional comparative studies on viral diagnoses in severe pneumonia hospital admissions are warranted elsewhere in Kenya. Such data may be informative to the Kenya Ministry of Health in their assessment of the role for influenza antivirals and vaccination in Kenya.",
