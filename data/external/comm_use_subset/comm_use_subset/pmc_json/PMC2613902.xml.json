To halt the outbreak of SARS infection, the hospital was shut down to allow evacuation of hospitalized patients and workers gradually over 10 days. Twenty-five days after that, the hospital was fully vacated and sterilization carried out. Outpatient services were first reopened after 35 days of quarantine. Inpatient and emergency services were reopened after 65 days. Subsequently, in addition to its general regional hospital function, the hospital became the infectious disease designated hospital for the Taipei area, and receives infectious disease patients, undergoes preparedness exercises and admits tuberculosis patients.",

Based on this recovery situation, all the departments can be divided into four groups; these are departments that recovered in the year SARS happened, departments that recovered in the first year after SARS, departments that recovered in the second year after SARS, and finally departments still not yet recovered. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model of outpatient volume in the pre-SARS year was developed. Various permutations of the order of correlation and order of integration (I) were computed to choose the optimal combination of parameters based on the mean square error. Partial correlogram graphs and correlograms were used to select the order of moving average (MA) and autoregressive (AR) terms in the model. Based on the best model selected, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to measure the quality of fit of the service volume of outpatients during the SARS, and two years after SARS period [9].",

The delayed recovery of outpatient service was also noted during and in the first year after SARS by the ARIMA model. After the SARS epidemic, the hospital became the infectious disease designated hospital for the Taipei area in additional to retaining its character as a general regional hospital. Many factors caused the changes in hospital performance, such as patient transfer to other hospitals, reduction of healthcare manpower due to death, sequelae to staff infection and staff turnover. In addition, the publicity related to the change in the hospital status to an infectious disease unit influenced performance. In the few years since SARS, hospital performance has improved continuously. However, only emergency services had recovered by the second year after SARS.

Family medicine, metabolism and nephrology departments have recovered quickly. Moreover, patient visits to family medicine and nephrology were even higher than before SARS. This indicates that chronic patients who need long-term treatment tend to go back to their former local hospital to receive their treatments. The patient visits to psychiatry decreased during the year SARS happened, and were obviously increased the year after SARS. This suggests that people may have needed to rely on psychiatry treatment after the SARS epidemic. Outpatient visits to surgery recovered slower. Only urology, plastic surgery and neurosurgery recovered in the year after SARS, and all others have not recovered as yet. Thus, the general public may not wish to receive surgery from an infectious disease designated hospital that once underwent an emergency shut down. As a result, the recovery of inpatient services is definitely affected. Inpatient services usually come from outpatient and emergency transfers. Therefore, recovery of the inpatient service volume is much slower than outpatient and emergency services.",

In this study, ED visits only recovered during the second year after SARS. There was no change in the ED numbers in the local area. Some papers have suggested that the decrease in ED visits can have different impacts on different subdivisions. For example, non-critical ED patient visits may decrease more than the critical patient visits [17,19].

In order to control the epidemic, the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, designated some public hospitals to admit major infectious disease patients. This measure had a positive effect on controlling the epidemic [3], and reminds people of the importance that public hospitals have in public health, preventive medicine, and the prevention of infectious diseases. Even three years after SARS, the nation still maintains the ideology of a designated hospital, and has expanded the prevention network national wide. Under the threat of new epidemics, an infectious disease designated hospital has to face the issue of losses in its operating performance. The medical standards and ideology of the designated hospital are always affected.",

It is very important for an infectious disease designated hospital to maintain its self-sufficient operation when the public health budget is under threat. Self-sufficient operation can reduce the need for a government subsidy and allow the maintenance of an adequate number of physicians as well as the quality of medical services at such a general hospital. Although the outpatient and inpatient services did not completely recovered from SARS during first year, the hospital had reached 84% to 86% of the baseline service volume during the second year after SARS. Therefore, the hospital should be capable of self-sufficiency as a designated hospital. In particular, the family medicine, metabolism and nephrology departments were hardly influenced by the shut down. In addition, some other departments had recovered by the second year. Therefore, these departments were able to maintain a sufficient number of physicians in the absence of an infection emergency. If another outbreak of major infectious disease occurs, the physicians in the above mentioned departments would be able to participate directly in prevention tasks. An adequate number of physicians are essential for the success of an infectious disease designated hospital. Thus, the findings of this study should provide a direction for other infectious disease designated hospitals to consider when deciding what subspecialties should be included in their makeup. If an infectious disease designated hospital includes a certain subspecialty and the physicians can operate self-sufficiently during ordinary times, the government only has to subside such a hospital during the year of the epidemic and the year after that. The hospital can become self-sufficient again quickly once everyday operations return.",

The outpatient and inpatient services in this example had not completely recovered by the second year after SARS. Emergency services were the fastest recovering department, but even this unit did not recover until the second year after SARS. Among outpatient services, family medicine, metabolism and nephrology recovered better than the others. Surgery needs a longer recovery period. This study provides the decision maker with information regards choices when managing an infectious disease designated hospital and is a reference resource for future public policy crisis management decisions during acute infectious disease outbreaks.",
