Following repeated washes, pre-treated BM-DCs were mixed together with T cells at 1 \u00d7 106/well (DC/T-cell ratios of 1:1) for 5 days. Thereafter, the mixed cells were collected for transwell migration assays. To induce cell migration RPMI-1640 medium (900 \u03bcl) containing CCL25 (10 ng/ml) was placed in the lower chamber, and RPMI-1640 medium (350 \u03bcl) containing 1 \u00d7 106 mixed cells (DCs mixed with T cells) was placed in the upper chamber. After 4 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, to determine the amount of CD3+ cells in the lower chamber, the migrated cells were collected, we counted the number of CD3+ cells by flow cytometry.",

Virus-specific CD8+ T cells play a central role in controlling and eliminating most pathogen infections. To the best of our knowledge, there are limited reports of studies focused on the design of CD8+ T cells-based vaccines in mucosal immunity3120. When given together with RA, exogenous antigens can effectively stimulate lymphocytes, which have an increased expression of gut-homing receptors and decrease the expression of skin-homing receptors on lymphocyte surfaces. These research studies indicated that the skin could replace Peyer\u2019s patches as an outstanding mucosal immune inductive site32. As we known, the area of abdominal skin was large and the temperature was constant, which was conducive to the vaccine absorption. Furthermore, there was less nerves distribution in abdominal skin, which was beneficial to reduce the injection pain and stress. Inguinal lymph node was located in the groin, so in our study the skin on the right groin was selected as an immune inductive site. We subcutaneously immunized piglets with corn oil, RA, or WI-TGEV alone or in combination with RA, or we orally immunized piglets with WI-TGEV alone. To analyze whether RA has the capability of generating gut-homing cells; therefore, cells were isolated from the right side of the inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) and ileum after immunization. Intriguingly, the flow cytometry data from the ILNs showed that the number of CD8+ cells that expressed \u03b27-integrin and CCR9 was significantly increased after RA administration compared with the control (Fig. 1A,B, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV increased the number of gut-homing CD8+ cells expressing \u03b27-integrin and CCR9 compared with the s.c. administration of TGEV alone in the ILNs (Fig. 1A,B, P < 0.05).",

Additionally, we assessed the level of CD8+ cell homing to the ileum. Notably, the flow cytometry data from the ileum showed that following the RA plus TGEV s.c. and oral TGEV treatments, the gut tropism receptor frequency on CD8+ cells was remarkably enhanced compared with the controls (Fig. 1C,D, P < 0.05). Next, we further evaluated the number of CD3+ cells in the porcine ileum with immunohistochemistry. In the cross-sectional view, CD3+ T cells were gathered in the epithelial layer and villous lamina propria (Fig. 1E, 400\u00d7 magnification). The RA plus TGEV s.c. administration substantially expanded the areas with CD3+ T cells compared with the controls (Fig. 1F, P < 0.01), although these levels were lower than those observed with the oral TGEV treatment.",

Our immunofluorescence results showed that the IgA-secreting cells were mainly gathered in the villous lamina propria or around the ileal glands (Fig. 2B\u2013F). In the ileum, the areas of IgA-secreting cells of the RA plus TGEV s.c. and oral TGEV treatment were significantly increased than control (P < 0.01), and the RA plus TGEV s.c. treatment significantly increased the areas containing IgA-secreting cells compared with the TGEV s.c. alone treatment (Fig. 2G, P < 0.01), however, this level was slightly less than the level observed following the oral TGEV delivery. Furthermore, we noted that the IgA-secreting cells displayed IgA and CCR9 co-expression in the villous lamina propria after the RA plus TGEV challenge (Fig. 2H\u2013J). A similar finding was observed in the faeces, in which the subcutaneous RA plus TGEV immunization obviously increased the TGEV-specific IgA levels compared with the s.c. TGEV alone treatment at days 7, 14 and 21(ELISA method) (Fig. 2K, P < 0.05), and this effect lasted longer than that of the oral TGEV immunization. For the systemic immune response, in the serum, we found that the TGEV-specific IgG titres in the RA plus TGEV s.c. treatment group remained at a high level during the entire immunity period (7\u201335 days) and were substantially greater than those in the other groups at day 7 (Fig. 2L, P < 0.05). These observations demonstrated that RA-assisted TGEV immunization could recruit IgA-secreting cells to the ileum and induce a robust antigen-specific IgA response in the faeces.",

To determine whether RA in the vaccine could recruit DCs to the small intestine, we isolated intestinal cells from piglets and determined the DC numbers in the lamina propria by flow cytometry. Very few HLA-DP+ CD16+ DCs (Fig. 3A,C) or SWC3a+ CD11b+ DCs (Fig. 3B,D) migrated to the small intestinal lamina propria following TGEV s.c. treatment. Nevertheless, the s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV and oral TGEV (positive control) significantly enhanced the frequency of these migrated DCs compared with TGEV s.c. treatment (Fig. 3C,D, P < 0.05). These findings suggested that s.c.

There was no significant difference between the levels of homing cells in the piglets with or without RA-treated T cells (Fig. 5B\u2013F). Observations of the intestinal villi and Peyer\u2019s patches (PPs) in cryosections further confirmed the flow cytometry results of homing cells (Fig. 5G,H). These data of T-cell gut-homing further confirmed the above results that RA did not directly increase expression of gut-homing receptors on T cells. For a deficiency of gut-homing receptors on T cells, T cells could not recruited into ileum. Thus, RA did not directly induce T-cell homing to the gut in the piglets.",

Notably, the maximum responsiveness to CCL25 relied on exogenous RA (1,000 nM) conditioning. On the contrary, the ability of the T cells to migrate from the apical side to the basolateral side of the transwell filters was significantly reduced after RA receptor agonists (RARs) (Ro-41-5253, 1,00 to 10,000 nM) were added with RA (1,000 nM) to the culture (Fig. 6H), the number of migrated cells among 1,000 or 10,000 nM Ro-41-5253 plus RA or RA treatments was no significant difference, which was consistent with a previous observation18. Taken together, the cell migration assay results revealed a strong chemotactic response in T cells when activated by RA-activated DCs.

The efficacies of oral inactivated vaccines are currently poor, mainly because inactivated antigens must overcome a series of mucosal barriers, including mucus, digestive fluid, and compact epithelium, before they are captured by submucosal antigen-presenting cells (APCs)27. Thus, oral administration generally requires a large concentration of antigens to achieve effective immune protection levels36.

RA is required to induce gut-tropic IgA-secreting cells in mice and humans324243. In our study, IgA-secreting cells were, remarkably, recruited to the intestinal lamina propria after the s.c. RA-TGEV treatment, which was in line with the subsequent strongly initiated IgA antibody response in the local porcine intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, the CCR9 expression on the IgA-secreting cells helped their cellular recruitment, and this was consistent with a previous report that RA was critical for the generation of gut-homing receptors on IgA-secreting cells41. Interestingly, RA plus TGEV immunization generated a long-lasting specific-sIgA response in the faeces, even though it was lower than the levels following the oral immunization, implying that an enhancement in SIgA secretion may be conducive to TGEV eliminate and infection resistance in the gut. However, it is worth mentioning that the antigen dose in the oral immunization was 10 times higher than that in the subcutaneous immunization in our study. Thus, at equal amount of antigen, it is possible that RA addition increases IgA secretion even above the secretion seen in response to the oral vaccine. Therefore, the RA administration in the subcutaneous immunization not only improved TGEV mucosal humoral immune responses but also was less expensive. Moreover, serum IgG plays a vital role in systemic immune responses, particularly for protecting against invasive pathogens that enter the bloodstream44. RA combined with the s.c. TGEV injection indeed induced a pronounced IgG response, which could compensate for the disadvantages of the oral immunization.",

To investigate the mechanisms by which RA acted on DCs, we directly treated porcine BM-DCs with RA (in vitro), However, the RA treatment was unable to up-regulate the gut-homing-specific molecules as in mice8, even with a wide range of doses. The possible reason for this may have been due to the species differences between porcine and mice. Our results also showed that RA couldn\u2019t up-regulated the expression of maturation phenotype molecules on porcine BM-DCs in vitro, such as SWC3a, CD1a, and HLA-DR molecule expression; these findings were supported by a previous study showing that RA treatment endowed BM-DCs with immature phenotypes via the down-regulation of CD80/86, CD40, and MHCII expression in mice51. These observations suggest that RA inhibits porcine BM-DC maturation, and they may help explain our previous observation that the DCs recruited to the intestinal lamina propria following RA-TGEV treatment were immature DCs that were conductive to capturing antigen and initiating a specific antibody response.",

            "text": "Given that RA failed to directly induce gut-homing receptors on DCs, we wondered whether RA could induce porcine lymphocytes to express the integrin \u03b27 and CCR9 receptors. However, in the porcine in vitro and competitive homing experiments, RA was unable to directly induce unactivated T cells to express gut-homing-specific receptors, and it also failed in inducing T-cell migration to the small bowel. We wondered about the mechanisms that induce CD8+ T cells to express the integrin \u03b27 and CCR9 receptors after RA-assisted TGEV s.c. challenge in vivo. Some studies have suggested that DCs are crucial in regulating downstream activation and differentiation of T cells5253. Moreover, some evidence has demonstrated that CD8+ T cells and IgA-secreting B cells express gut-homing receptors via intestinal DC interactions1054. The above analysis tempts us to speculate that RA may regulate DCs in the porcine inguinal lymph nodes to imprint gut tropism receptors on lymphocytes. Intriguingly, our data confirmed that RA cooperated with BM-DCs in promoting T cell proliferation, suggesting that RA-pretreated BM-DCs may have a powerful capacity to transfer antigens to T cells. Our data further indicated that T cells expressed high gut-homing-specific receptor levels following incubation with RA-pretreated BM-DCs, implying that porcine RA-pretreated BM-DCs may have the ability to imprint integrin \u03b27 and CCR9 receptor expression on lymphocytes. Moreover, a cell migration assay was performed using transwell inserts, and the T cells that were treated with RA and DCs displayed a strong chemotactic response to porcine CCL25, which was consistent with a recent study in mice8 that showed a powerful homing capacity for these cells. Additionally, the capacity of RA-pretreated DCs to induce gut-homing receptors on responding T cells was blocked by an RAR antagonist, and those T cells lost the ability to migrate, supporting the hypothesis that RA is indispensable for generating gut tropic T cells in piglets. In view of the in vitro study, the RA-pretreated BM-DCs showed a significant ability to activate T cells to express gut-homing receptors for migration. One possible mechanism for this, with regard to the RA-pretreated DCs, is that RA could act as a \u201cmucosal adjuvant\u201d to induce mucosal DC and lymphocyte activation1854. Furthermore, exogenous RA promotes intestinal lamina propria DCs to produce endogenous RA55, which guarantees gut-homing \u03b14\u03b27 and CCR9 expression by effector T cells11. Thus, another possibility is that the RA-pretreated DCs may also generate or combine with other cytokines to jointly promote gut-homing molecule expression, such as RA inducing mucosal DCs to secrete TGF \u03b2 and IL-6, which enhance gut-homing receptors on lymphocytes18. However, the mechanistic knowledge by which porcine intestinal DC subsets develop is still limited; therefore, further studies will be needed to obtain insights into these potential mechanisms.",
