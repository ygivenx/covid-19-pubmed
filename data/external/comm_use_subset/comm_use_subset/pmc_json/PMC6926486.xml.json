            "text": "Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for studies on the prevalence and diversity of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection from database inception until May 30, 2019, without language restrictions. We used the term \u201cMERS*\u201d combined with any single other term from the following list: \u201ccoronavirus*\u201d, \u201ccamels*\u201d, \u201cdromedaries*\u201d, \u201crecombinant*\u201d, \u201cphylogeny*\u201d, \u201cphylogeography\u201d, \u201cAfrica*\u201d, \u201csequenc*\u201d, \u201cprevalence\u201d, \u201cage\u201d, and \u201ctransmission\u201d. Since the discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012, multiple sequencing studies have been done on viruses from camels and humans mainly in the Arabian Peninsula. Few studies exist on sequences from Africa, but all of these sequences are from camels rather than from humans, whereas most of the sequences from the Arabian Peninsula are from humans. Sampling bias is likely to affect all studies. The number of studies, and hence samples collected, from Africa is small compared with those from the Arabian Peninsula.Added value of this studyWe took advantage of sampling opportunities at the Port of Jeddah, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where large numbers of camels are continuously imported from Africa. By sampling before offloading from ships we made sure to take samples from animals that came directly from Africa and had no contact with local camels in Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, the resulting sample of African camel-borne MERS-CoV is the largest so far from the African continent. Our data enhance the overall picture of African strains of the virus, including the phylogenetic and geographical associations, which has enabled us to undertake comparisons of diversity against representatively large samples from the Arabian Peninsula. Our comparisons take sampling dates into account. We infer that Arabian and African strains of the virus have been separated for a time that exceeds the present observation period in all studies (ie, the virus strains have been separated since before 2012). We suggest that African strains of the virus are not transmitted in Arabian camels, despite large numbers of African camels frequently being imported into Saudi Arabia; and that Arabian strains of the virus might be self-sufficient in terms of their reproductive rate to maintain endemic circulation. By sampling from local camels in Saudi Arabia, we found that a novel clade of MERS-CoV that emerged in 2014 remains the only detected viral variant in camels from Saudi Arabia, suggesting that strains of this clade might be dominant over other viral strains that were co-endemic in camels before 2014.Implications of all the available evidenceOur results suggest that a recently emerged clade of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia should be compared with African strains of the virus and with older Arabian strains to address the question of a potential increase in transmissibility and virulence. Change in transmissibility and virulence would affect the general assessment of pandemic risks emanating from MERS-CoV.",

Samples were obtained over an almost 2-year period and were collected from about 15% of all camels aboard a ship. Sampling took place by entering the animal compartment and sampling accessible animals at random. Often ships held camels in two separate compartments, and so for our study we took samples from camels in both compartments. The second cohort comprised local camels from herds in Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Local samples were collected after the surveillance at the Port of Jeddah. In Jeddah, we collected 30% of samples from three camel farms approximately 45 km south of Jeddah and one farm approximately 50 km north of Jeddah, while we collected the other 70% of samples at an abattoir in the city before the camels were slaughtered. In Riyadh, we collected samples from camel farms and a camel market in a circle with a 60 km radius in and around the city.",

Because previous studies have shown that serotype discrimination does not exist between MERS-CoV clades, our findings suggests that viruses in Saudi Arabia can remain endemic without introduction of new strains from Africa.8 Therefore, we focused on the reproductive rate of viruses in Saudi Arabia. Using a curated dataset of Arabian strains of the virus, we subjected all strains of the virus belonging to clade B, whether derived from humans or camels, to analyses of Re based on Bayesian birth death skyline analyses. We used this approach to obtain a dataset as complete as possible from a virus population that is close to the requirements of coalescent analysis\u2014namely, panmixis and contingency as a population. Human-derived viral sequences were selected in such a way that they most likely represent primary cases; human-derived viruses were thus regarded as sentinels for enzootic evolution in camels, as previously reported.23 We only used the non-recombinant part of clade A and B virus genomes for this analysis because all recent isolates belonged to the NRC. The overall estimate of Re had a mean of 1\u00b716, compatible with sustained endemicity. Re increased in the period between early 2017 and the middle of 2018, which we associate with the increased sampling effort by our study. We undertook two analyses of Re, one not including the novel viruses identified in this study (figure 3A) and the other including the full curated dataset (figure 3B). By omitting the new sequences, the Re of MERS-CoV seems to decrease over time, highlighting that inclusion of new sequences is important to maintain an accurate picture of viral spread. Notably, this result is subject to previous assumptions made in our analyses.",

By analysing a large number of strains of MERS-CoV imported into Saudi Arabia from major African trade ports, we showed that Arabian strains of the virus are isolated from African strains and identify African MERS-CoV clades that were not as clearly distinguished in previous studies. Although all African strains of the virus share common ancestors in east Africa, only clade C1 presently appears in west and north Africa. Even if all African clades are represented in east Africa, no single place sampled so far in east Africa represents the whole diversity of MERS-CoV variants. Phylogeographical and social network analyses suggest that the present distribution of African clades is not predominantly shaped by transregional exchange but mainly reflects the phylogenetic tree structure. Camel trade, such as via the Sahel route connecting east and west Africa, corresponds with the present location of C1.1 strains but does not seem to cause a bidirectional exchange of strains between east and west Africa. Only for the clustering of Moroccan with west African strains and some strains from Kenya and Djibouti, the geographical distance between sites exceeds that of the attributed genetic distance, suggesting recent exchange through trade routes. Our phylogenetic tree structure shows that only parts of the diversity of clades C1 and C3 are represented in Sudan. Recombination between these clades is not observed, despite co-occurrence in Sudan. Therefore, Sudan appears to be a frequent recipient of viral lineages from other regions although we did not identify any strictly Sudan-specific lineages.",

ORF4b encodes a phosphodiesterase that degrades 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate and thereby prevents the activation of RNase L, an important cellular antiviral effector.28, 29 The importance of this function for the spread of MERS-CoV and its ability to infect organisms under natural conditions is of interest. In-vitro studies suggest an attenuation of replication in viruses whose ORF4b region has undergone deletions.8 One could speculate that slightly deleterious mutants can sustain themselves better in so-called sink populations, whereas in source populations they would typically be out-competed by non-deleted strains that have higher reproductive fitness. Our data in combination with those of Chu and colleagues8 suggest that sink populations of MERS-CoV are hosted by west African camels and the possible geographical origin of all African MERS-CoV clades, thus the so-called source population is found in east Africa. The lesser density of camels in west Africa than in east Africa and the Arabian Peninsula supports the idea of an evolutionary dead end for MERS-CoV in that region. Particularly, Nigeria could be considered a dead end or sink area given the reduced density of camels towards the tropical zone of west Africa.",

We were surprised to see a similar age structure of imported compared with local virus-positive camels, suggesting that age-related contact barriers in husbandry would not explain the absence of transmission; however, notably, approximately 15% of sampled animals were of unknown age.
