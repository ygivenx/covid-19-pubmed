CSFV leads to huge economic loss in the swine industry as CSF causes problems characterized by high fever, alternating constipation, diarrhea and high mortality [1], [2]. Transmission of this virus mainly depends on contact spread, but recent investigations indicated that infected boars could transmit CSFV in semen as well [3], [4]. This disease was first identified in USA during a continuous major nationwide epizootics, and was subsequently found in many other countries [5], [6]. The last major CSF epidemic in European Union occurred mainly in Netherlands and to a lesser extent in Germany, Italy, Belgium and Spain [7], [8]. Considering its rapid speed in spreading across national borders, and the huge socio-economic damage to the porcine industry, CSF was classified as a notifiable disease by OIE [9].",

Receptors for CSFV recognition are crucial for host antiviral immune responses [10]. Thus blocking CSFV receptors could be an effective way to control CSFV. Glycoprotein E (gpE), presented on the flaviviral particle surface has a conservative spatial structure [11]. It is thought to interact with cell surface receptors during the early stage of virus infection. Research done by Bogachek, demonstrated that the gpE domain III from WNV interacts with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 at an initial stage of entry into the host cells [12]. However, specific function of integrin in CSFV infection has not yet been reported.",

It is also known that integrins play various roles in cell adhesion, migration, embryonic development, angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, immune responses and wound healing [16], [17]. Specifically, integrin \u03b23, which is present on a variety of cell surfaces, is one of the most important cell receptors. Integrin \u03b23 mediates extracellular signals by recognizing and delivering different molecules into cells, resulting in changes in calcium, Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) and PI-3K (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase) activity [18]\u2013[26]. The activation and communication between PI-3K and internal calcium are crucial for integrin outside-in signaling. More importantly, integrin \u03b23 is known to be a receptor or co-receptor for many viruses, such as Rotavirus [27]\u2013[30], Hantavirus [31]\u2013[33], and Foot-and-mouth disease virus [34], [35]. It also plays a key role in infection processes of Adenovirus [36], [37], West Nile Virus [32], Human immunodeficiency virus [38], [39], Human Parecho virus [40]\u2013[42], and Herpes simplex virus type 1 [43]\u2013[45]. Furthermore, previous studies from our laboratory have shown that integrin \u03b23 is up-regulated in endothelial cells post CSFV infection (post CSFV infection = p.i.) [46].",

Functional-blocking or shRNA-mediated depletion of integrin \u03b23 in EC cells dramatically decreased the rate of CSFV proliferation. This study also adds another receptor-function of integrin \u03b23 and provides the first insight of a promising active receptor for CSFV infection.

Moreover, integrin \u03b23 mRNA was up regulated in all four cell lines after CSFV infection (Fig. 3C), revealing that integrin \u03b23 is up-regulated by the host cell as a response to CSFV infection. Specifically, the result of Fig. 3C showed that ST cells and IEC cells exhibited the highest amounts of integrin \u03b23 mRNA at 72 h p.i., while EC cells and PK cells reached peak amounts of integrin \u03b23 mRNA at 24 h p.i. These results reveal that, as a response to CSFV invasion, integrin \u03b23 is modulated to different levels in different cell lines.

This result is consistent with the integrin \u03b23 functional blocking assay, thereby confirming that a cellular reduction of integrin \u03b23 amount decreases the rate of CSFV proliferation.

In this study, we document that integrin \u03b23, a membrane-bound signal mediator, is required for CSFV infection and proliferation. CSFV proliferates very efficiently in ST cells (Fig. 1 and 2), which was positively correlated with the high amount of integrin \u03b23 in these cells (Fig. 3). In addition, the amount of CSFV proliferation decreased in integrin \u03b23-funtionally blocked cells (Fig. 5) as well as in integrin \u03b23-deficient cells (Fig. 7). Collectively, our results strongly imply that integrin \u03b23 plays a critical role in CSFV infection and proliferation, presumably by modulating CSFV adherence and emergence from host cells.",

Many reports revealed that viruses from Flaviviradea family use integrin \u03b23 as a receptor or co-receptor during the infection stage [27], [51]\u2013[58]. For example, acute CSF shares a high level of similarity with Dengue virus (DV) [2], [59] that causes classical dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [53]. It has been demonstrated that integrin \u03b23 is required for DV type2 to enter vascular endothelial cells, and that integrin \u03b23 is up-regulated during DV infection [59], [60]. Similarly, we found that integrin \u03b23 was up-regulated in all four swine cell lines (EC, IEC, PK and ST) during CSFV infection (Fig. 3C), which is in line with previous research of Tang, etc. [46]. ST cells possessing high amount of integrin \u03b23, also show high susceptibility to CSFV infection. Many other studies have also reported that integrin \u03b23 is a receptor for foot-and-mouth disease virus [54]\u2013[56], coxackievirus A9 [51], echovirus 9 [52] and rotavirus [27], [30], [61].

Song, etc. [64] demonstrated that integrin \u03b23 is important for Hantavirus infection, whereas integrin \u03b1v showed less effect than integrin \u03b23 does in vivo. Neff, etc. [65] demonstrated that the bovine integrin \u03b23 subunit was responsible for the receptor-function of integrin in FMDV infection, while \u03b1v subunit was not equally required as \u03b23 subunit. Based on these prior reports, we focused on the role of integrin \u03b23 in CSFV infection. Even though it is yet to be established why CSFV targets integrin \u03b23, Bensaude, etc. have demonstrated that CSFV inhibits apoptosis of host cells, thus allowing the establishment of long-term infection and proliferation [66]. Integrin is responsible for cell adhesion, so its depletion would lead to loss of adhesion and subsequent apoptosis. The results from our study and Tang, etc. confirm that integrin \u03b23 is up-regulated post CSFV infection. This suggests that CSFV infection results in the up-regulation of integrin so as to keep host cells in a condition that allows additional proliferation of virions.",

This indicates that the receptor for E2, which has not yet been disclosed, is much more specific and important for CSFV infection. Bogachek [12] demonstrated that gpE from WNV recognizes integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 during the entry stage into the host cells. In this study, we demonstrated that integrin \u03b23 is indeed required for CSFV infection and proliferation.
