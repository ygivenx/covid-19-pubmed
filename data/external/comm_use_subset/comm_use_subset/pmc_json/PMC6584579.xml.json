Active surveillance systems can provide relatively accurate and prompt information on infectious diseases of concern, but usually cover a limited range of diseases due to cost and time considerations2. Thus, many countries rely on passive surveillance systems with clinical notifications for monitoring the majority of infectious diseases. Compared with active systems, passive systems enable continuous monitoring over large geographical areas at relatively lower cost. However, incomplete data may be collected in a passive surveillance system, with low reporting rates requiring additional investigations or data collection processes3.",

Therefore, these 46 diseases were excluded from this study. Among the remaining infectious diseases, those with less than ten patients per year in the NIDS and NHICS were excluded. Additionally, diseases that were included in the NIDS since 2013 (such as MERS-CoV, Zika virus, and hepatitis C virus) were excluded for comparability. Chronic infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B virus, syphilis, leprosy, and tuberculosis were also excluded due to possibility of duplicated case numbers and complex diagnostic codes. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection is not included in NIDS due to the special protection act for HIV/AIDS patients18, and was excluded. Finally, data of 26 infectious diseases were analysed and the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes of target infectious diseases are shown in Supplementary Table 1.",

While evaluating reporting rates requires effort and time, the ratio of reporting cases to claim cases can be considered as a convenient indicator of the reporting rate21. We used R/C ratio as an indicator of reporting rate. Additionally, we used the R/C ratio to compare the performance of two surveillance systems, demonstrating that various factors may affect performance. We found that the overall ratio increased in most infectious diseases after the MERS-CoV outbreak, which may have promoted disease reporting from health service providers and the general awareness of public on notifiable diseases22. This may have strengthened the performance of the national disease surveillance system. However, an increase in the R/C ratio may be affected by unexpected factors. For example, patients suspected of having scarlet fever were included in the reporting standard since September 2012. Moreover, private complementary health insurance schemes have become very popular in the ROK; patients have asked doctors to issue certificates that clinicians have reported to NIDS as a requirement for reimbursement from private insurance23. This might have led to an increase in the reporting rate and R/C ratio. Such phenomenon may cause the misinterpretation of other infectious diseases (e.g., varicella) if only report-based surveillance is used24,25. Furthermore, the R/C ratio for legionellosis and EHEC far exceeded 1. This means that some patients were notified without proper diagnosis codes. These diseases were often confirmed after the patient was discharged in the past; however, after MERS, the reporting system reform led to a report even if the patient was discharged. Moreover, temporary active surveillance for social concern can influence the reported cases of carriers. The above-mentioned points can be considered as the reasons for the abnormal R/C ratio (exceeding 1) of EHEC and legionella26. Recently, Lyme disease and SFTS have been monitored under NIDS27, and physicians\u2019 awareness has increased. An increase in R/C ratios should be interpreted carefully; if the R/C ratio has changed significantly, it is essential to evaluate factors that may result in changes in the reporting rate.",

In the post-MERS-CoV outbreak period, varicella showed a good concordance between the two systems, which may be due to its typical symptoms. The presence of typical symptoms may reduce the chance of misdiagnosis or unspecified diagnoses. With the same reason, a relatively high Pearson\u2019s R was observed for the infectious diseases that have robust and easily accessible confirmatory examination for differential diagnosis, such as HAV, HFRS, leptospirosis, and malaria. In the case of scarlet fever and mumps, that have to be differentially diagnosed from certain infectious diseases, the incidence rates may not be accurate as per both NIDS- and NHICS, as it is not usual to perform a confirmatory examination for those diseases in Korea. However, this study demonstrated a good concordance, due to decreased hesitation in diagnosing and reporting relatively unique symptoms, even without a confirmed diagnosis. An increase in the population covered by the private health insurance is suspected to be a contributing factor. For infectious diseases complying with the above-mentioned conditions, the concordance between the two surveillance systems is high. Rather, NHICS can complement the low reporting rate of NIDS and its results can be more stable because it is not affected by the change in NIDS-associated reporting rate (due to MERS, temporary active surveillance, and newly implemented notifiable disease). Furthermore, considering the recent concern over the accuracy of NIDS due to an increased burden in data collection (e.g., the different diseases that need to be reported and the number of patients who need to be reported have increased), the applicability of NHICS data should be considered by public health officials.",

This means that there is stability in the relationship between the two systems for the diseases. However, some infectious diseases presented no or poor linearity, which could be due to baseline noise in claims-based surveillance or those with recent low incidence. Considering the local epidemiology of mosquito-borne or tick-borne diseases in the ROK, it is evident that SFTS or Japanese encephalitis reported in January\u2013March are not actual incidences but can be recognised as noise. In the observational period, the noise of claimed cases seems to be evident in the non-prevalent period of the respective diseases as the denominator of the R/C ratio increases. This baseline noise is believed to be prevalent throughout the claim-based surveillance period for whole subject infectious diseases in the present study. If information processing technology is developed to eliminate this noise, the usefulness of claim-based surveillance can be increased.",

Due to the healthcare system in Korea, there is a lack of laboratory-based surveillance systems. Most medical institutions in Korea are privately owned, and public hospitals account for only approximately 10%. Therefore, the laboratory is often owned by a private large hospital, and information from the laboratory is not shared. With certain emerging infectious diseases, national laboratory surveillance is carried out; however, information from private laboratories is not integrated even for infectious diseases with a high incidence.",

Additionally, its cost burden is comparatively lower and it can be applied easily. The burden of data collection should be reduced to improve the accuracy of national surveillance systems. The case of scarlet fever and varicella23,29 in this study are good examples. The number of patients reported by the surveillance increased owing to the leniency in the reporting standard, which led to an increase in the burden of data collection, which, in turn, led to poor surveillance quality and inaccurate monitoring. The selection and concentration can be necessary with the assumption that the government has limited resources.

The surveillance system should also be designed to identify the source of infections, whether it was acquired from abroad or domestic, through separate diagnosis codes. This claim-based surveillance may not be limited to infectious diseases. For example, an increase in certain diseases due to extensive exposure to novel chemicals can be better found in a claim-based surveillance. In addition, a traditional surveillance system could be supplemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions, such as the national immunization program in the time series.

In addition, studies to complement the inaccuracies of the two surveillance systems, such as using the \u201ccapture-recapture method\u201d, are needed. Second, this study was conducted in single country. Third, each disease has different immune status or epidemics in each country. Therefore, the appropriate interpretation and application are necessary. Claim-based surveillance can be a good candidate for the surveillance of diseases that have a high incidence and are easily diagnosed by physicians (due to typical symptoms or highly accessible laboratory tests). Another problem to be solved for the application of claim-based surveillance is \u2018information for action\u2019, which requires timeliness. However, claims-based surveillance systems in Korea lack timeliness because of the billing behaviour of medical institutions, as most hospitals charge within one week of their patients discharge or visit, while some hospitals charge 1\u20132 months later. Therefore, no matter how fast the data processing is done, an inherent time delay will occur.",

The type of infectious surveillance methodology should be selected in consideration of the nature of infectious diseases. Certain methodology of surveillance systems may not be completely superior to another surveillance methodology. Although we expect claim-based surveillance to play an increasingly important role in monitoring infectious diseases, more active use of this system and studies on alternative surveillance systems are required for improving the performance of infectious diseases surveillance systems.",
