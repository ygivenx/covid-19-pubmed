The ability of IAV to constantly change in response to immune pressure or antiviral treatment limits the effectiveness of currently used antiviral interventions. Thus, vaccines against seasonal influenza need to be annually reformulated and will provide little if any protection against pandemic influenza [1]. Moreover, the effectiveness of antivirals targeting the viral proteins M2 and neuraminidase is compromised by the frequent emergence and transmission of resistance mutations [1, 2]. Therefore, novel approaches to combat influenza are urgently needed.",

            "text": "IAVs are enveloped and harbor eight segments of genomic viral RNA. Defective interfering (DI) genomic segments can be generated in IAV infected cells due to errors of the viral polymerase [3, 4]. DI segments usually harbor a large deletion which inactivates the open reading frame encoded by the segment [3, 4]. The DI segments can interfere with amplification of wild type (wt) segments, potentially by competing for viral and cellular resources required for segment replication. Moreover, DI RNAs can be packaged into progeny virions, termed defective interfering particles (DIPs), and coinfection of target cells with DIPs and IAV will result in preferential amplification of DIPs and suppression of IAV spread [3, 4]. This effect has been observed in cell culture [5\u20138] and in experimentally infected animals [5, 9\u201315] and may extend to unrelated viruses [14, 16], due to the activation of the interferon system [15, 16]. Moreover, DIP application in a therapeutic or preventive setting prevents or ameliorates influenza in animal models [3\u20135, 10\u201316]. In sum, DIPs can be considered natural antivirals produced in the context of infection with IAV and many other viruses and may provide a basis for the development of new strategies for antiviral intervention.",

The presence of standard virus poses a safety concern when products for animal and human use are generated and complicates the interpretation of experimental data. Plasmid systems encoding for wt and DI segments along with cell lines expressing the IAV proteins for which the genomic information has been lost upon DI RNA formation might circumvent this issue [4, 19]. However, expression of the viral polymerase subunit PB2 in trans was found to be insufficient for robust amplification of IAV variants harboring temperature sensitive mutations [20, 21] and it has been speculated that similar limitations might apply to the production of DIPs [4]. Moreover, it has been suggested that PB2 expression might be toxic to cells [4]. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the strategy outlined above might allow for production of segment 1-derived DIPs and at present no system for generation of DIPs in the absence of standard virus has been reported.",

This deletion removes most of the PB2 ORF but leaves the 3\u2019 244 nucleotides and 5\u2019 151 nucleotides of segment 1 intact which are sufficient for segment replication and packaging [4, 22].

            "text": "Plasmids for rescue of the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) strain, pHW191-pHW198, were used throughout this study and have been previously described [23]. To generate a retroviral vector encoding PB2, the PB2 open reading frame was amplified from pHW191 using primers PB2-QCXIP-5N (5- CCGCGGCCGCACCATGGAAAGAATAAAAGAACTAC-3) and PB2-3XBgl (5-GGAGATCTCGAGCTAATTGATGGCCATCCGAAT-3) and cloned into the retroviral vector pQCXIP-mcs using NotI and XhoI [24]. This self-inactivating vector allows constitutive expression of PB2 and puromycin resistance genes coupled by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). An optimized sequence of PB2 was generated by hand to maximize sequence deviation from PB2 and optimizing codon usage for influenza A virus and humans (S1 Fig). This sequence was synthesized and cloned by GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany) and subcloned using NotI and XhoI sites into pQCXIP-mcs. A plasmid for DI-244 rescue was generated by splice overlap PCR, using pHW191 as template and primer pairs fluA AarI-PB2-1G (5- CGATCACCTGCTCGAGGGAGCGAAAGCAGGTC-3)/IAVseg1-DI244rep-rev (5- AATGAGGAATCCCCTCAGTTAAGCGGCCGCTGCGGTACCAGATCTCTTCTCCTGTCTTCCTGA-3) and IAVseg1-DI244rep-for (5- TCAGGAAGACAGGAGAAGAGATCTGGTACCGCAGCGGCCGCTTAACTGAGGGGATTCCTCATT-3)/fluA AarI-PB1-2341R (5- CGATCACCTGCTCTCTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGCATTT-3). The product of the splice overlap PCR was then purified and amplified with the segment specific primer pair fluA AarI-PB2-1G/fluA AarI-PB1-2341R and cloned into pHW2000-GGAarI, using golden gate cloning, generating pHW2000-DI244-mcs [25]. In addition, a construct containing a multiple cloning site (mcs) was generated for later insertion of reporter genes. For this, the PCR fragments were amplified using pHW191 as template and primer pairs fluA AarI-PB2-1G/IAVseg1-DI244rep-rev (5- AATGAGGAATCCCCTCAGTTAAGCGGCCGCTGCGGTACCAGATCTCTTCTCCTGTCTTCCTGA-3) and IAVseg1-DI244rep-for (5- TCAGGAAGACAGGAGAAGAGATCTGGTACCGCAGCGGCCGCTTAACTGAGGGGATTCCTCATT-3)/ fluA AarI-PB1-2341R followed by splice overlap joining and golden gate cloning. As reporter gene, mScarlet-i without internal SalI and NotI sites and fused to the porcine teschovirus-1 (PTV1) 2A sequence (GATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP) was cloned into the mcs as a BglII/NotI fragment. In this way, a PB2 (aa 1\u201341)-2A-mScarlet-i ORF was generated, which allows the detection of the presence of DI-244 via mScarlet-i fluorescence. The template for mScarlet-i, pmScarlet-i_C1, was a gift from Dorus Gadella (Addgene plasmid # 85044) [26]. The integrity of PCR-amplified, cloned sequences was verified by sequence analysis.",

For this, we first used retroviral transduction and selection antibiotics to generate 293T and MDCK cell lines stably expressing PB2. Immunoblot revealed that the cell lines obtained by selection expressed robust levels of PB2 (Fig 1A and Fig 1B). In order to analyze whether PB2 is functional in these cells, we employed a mini-replicon system, which measures the amplification of a firefly luciferase encoding IAV reporter segment upon coexpression of PB2, PB1, PA and NP [30]. We found that transfection of 293T-PB2 cells with a plasmid encoding the reporter segment alone yielded luciferase activity in the background range while cotransfection of PB2, PB1, PA and NP expression plasmids increased luciferase activity more than 1,000-fold (Fig 1C). Importantly, this increase was not observed when the PB1 plasmid was omitted while omission of the PB2 plasmid had no impact on reporter activity (Fig 1C). Thus, the PB2 protein stably expressed in 293T cells was functional. Unfortunately, similar studies in MDCK cells were not feasible due to the low transfectability of these cells.",

For this, we modified the codons in the PB2 expression plasmid (S1 Fig) to reflect codon preferences of human genes and IAV. As a second criterion for codon choice, we opted for maximal sequence difference between the A/PR/8/34-based sequence previously used for PB2 expression and the newly generated, optimized PB2 sequence (PB2opt), in order to prevent potential recombination events. 293T and MDCK cells were engineered to stably express PB2opt and immunoblot revealed that expression levels of PB2opt in MDCK but not 293T cells were higher than those obtained upon expression of non-codon-optimized PB2 (Fig 1A and Fig 1B). Moreover, growth of PB2opt cells was comparable to that of control cells and PB2opt expression was readily detectable after multiple passages, suggesting that expression was not associated with overt cytotoxicity. Finally, analysis of 293T-PB2opt cells in the mini-replicon assay showed that PB2opt supported IAV segment replication (Fig 4).",

In contrast, the supernatants were not infectious for MDCK cells (Fig 5A). Moreover, a direct comparison of 293T-PB2/MDCK-PB2 and 293T-PB2opt/MDCK-PB2opt cells for production of infectious DIPs and for DIP amplification upon infection revealed that the PB2opt cells were more efficient. Thus, more red fluorescent cells were observed when supernatants from PB2 expressing cells were added to MDCK-PB2opt as compared to MDCK-PB2 cells (Fig 5B). Similarly, supernatants from PB2opt cells were more infectious for target MDCK-PB2opt cells as compared to MDCK-PB2 cells. In keeping with this observation, quantification of production of infectious DIPs by focus formation assay and counting of red fluorescent cells revealed that at least 80% of foci (identified by antibody staining) were positive for mScarlet-i, as expected, and that PB2opt cells produced up to 4 x 106 infectious DIPs per ml and thereby exceeded titers obtained with PB2 cells (2,5 x 103) by ~1,500-fold (Fig 5C and Fig 5D).",

In order to investigate the antiviral activity of DI-244-mScarlet-i, we first analyzed whether DI-244-mScarlet-i produced in PB2opt cells interfered with the spread of a homologous IAV, A/PR/8/34, in MDCK cells (Fig 2C). For this, MDCK cells were coinfected with the indicated dilutions of DI-244 containing supernatants and A/PR/8/34 at an MOI of 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 (Fig 6A). This resulted in IAV/DIP ratios of approximately 1:10 (undiluted DIP containing supernatants, IAV at MOI 0.1), 1:100 (undiluted DIP containing supernatants, IAV at MOI 0.01) and 1:1,000 (undiluted DIP containing supernatants, IAV at MOI 0.001), respectively. The supernatants from 293T/MDCK wt cells transfected with plasmids for DI-244 production were used as negative control. The control supernatants did not appreciably interfere with A/PR/8/34 infection while supernatants from PB2opt cells efficiently blocked IAV infection in a concentration dependent manner, with highest antiviral activity observed at an IAV/DIP ratio of 1:1,000 (Fig 6A). Specifically, infection efficiency relative to untreated virus (set as 100%) was 1 \u00b1 0.5% in the presence of DIP containing supernatants at a dilution of 100 and 93 \u00b1 13% in the presence of control supernatants (average of six independent experiments). Moreover, DI-244 containing supernatants also inhibited infection by A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) in a concentration dependent manner (Fig 6B), in keeping with the concept that DI-244 exerts broad anti-IAV activity [3, 4]. Finally, DI-244 containing supernatants did not inhibit VSV infection (Fig 6C), indicating that DI-244 neither interfered with VSV genome replication nor altered viral control by a potential IFN response in MDCK cells. These results show that DI-244 produced in PB2opt expressing cells exerts potent anti-IAV activity.",

In addition, production of DI-244 particles from a plasmid system has been described [34, 35]. This approach relies on the transfection of plasmids for production of infectious IAV in conjunction with a plasmid containing the DI-244 segment and results in the co-production of DIPs and standard virus [34, 35]. Before DIP preparations produced in these systems can be used for experimentation, the remaining standard virus needs to be inactivated by UV light [18]. This approach builds on the preferential inactivation of standard virus relative to DIPs. Thus, a mutation in a gene essential for viral spread will abrogate infectivity of standard virus but may have no effect on DIP infectivity since the missing proteins will be complemented in trans in cells coinfected with DIPs and standard virus. However, controlling the efficiency of UV inactivation of standard virus is technically challenging. Moreover, the effect of UV light on DIP infectivity is difficult to determine and both issues may complicate large scale production of DIPs as well as interpretation of experimental data and animal trials. Thus, establishment of novel cell culture systems for DIP production in the absence of standard virus is an important task.",

This finding was not expected given that several reports indicate that PB2 expression alone is insufficient to allow robust spread of IAV variants with temperature sensitive mutations in the PB2 gene at non-permissive temperatures [20, 21]. Moreover, it has been suggested that PB2 expression might be associated with unwanted cytotoxic effects [4]. The present study suggests that up to 4 x 106 DI-244 particles/ml can be produced in cells expressing codon optimized PB2, which roughly translates into production of 10 infectious DIPs per cell, and it can be speculated that efficiency of DIP production can be further increased by employing cell lines stably coexpressing PB1, PB2 and PA. Occasionally, weak fluorescence has been observed in DIP inoculated control cells. This is most likely attributable to low levels of DI-244 mRNA expression facilitated by PB2 protein associated with DI-244 vRNA present in the infecting DIPs. In contrast, no evidence for production of infectious IAV due to recombination between the DI-244 RNA and the RNA encoding for PB2 was obtained, as judged by bright field microscopy, immunofluorescence, focus formation assay and RT-PCR analysis, indicating that the DIP production system reported here is safe.",

            "text": "Quantification of DIP production so far relied on quantitative RT-PCR and hemagglutination assay [4, 8, 17], which do not provide information on particle infectivity. This limitation has been overcome by the present study which demonstrates that infectivity of DI-244 particles can be quantified using a standard technique, focus formation assay. The availability of this method should help comparing results obtained with different DI-244 preparations or other segment 1 DIPs and should thus advance the development of DIPs as antiviral agents. In this context, it is noteworthy that a IAV/DIP ratio of 1:1,000 resulted in the most prominent antiviral activity in our hands and a very similar ratio, 1:3,400 (as determined by estimations based on quantitative RT-PCR (DIP) and infectious units (IAV)), was previously reported to be minimally required to protect mice from severe influenza [4]. Thus, our study confirms and extends published work indicating that DIPs have to be provided in vast excess to exert antiviral activity. Whether sufficient numbers of DIPs can be delivered to the human respiratory tract and remain stable to provide protection against influenza for a prolonged time remains to be determined. In this context, one can speculate that an IAV:DIP ratio of less than 1:1,000 might be sufficient for antiviral activity in humans, since DIPs might exert direct antiviral activity by inhibiting IAV genome replication and induce the IFN system. Moreover, DIPs were reported to have a long residence time in the respiratory tract of mice and DIP-treated animals were found to still be protected at one week after treatment [4, 35]. Thus, DIP stability in the respiratory tract might not pose a major hurdle to the use of DIPs for influenza prevention and therapy in humans. Finally, it should be stated that reassortment of DIPs with IAV in coinfected cells is likely to occur. However, if DIPs based on the low pathogenic A/PR/8/34 or related viruses are used (like in the present study), such reassortment events should not result in viruses with increased transmissibility or virulence as compared to the wt virus.",

            "text": "It is believed that DI-244 can interfere with spread of diverse IAV in cell culture due to genome competition [3, 4]. Indeed, DI-244 produced in PB2opt cells exerted comparable antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV (no statistically significant differences), in keeping with H3N2 polymerase complexes being fully functional on H1N1 genomic segments [36]. This matches data published for DI-244 generated by use of standard virus [35] and demonstrates that DIPs produced in PB2 expressing cells are fully functional, although the activity of purified DIPs remains to be examined. DI-244 can also interfere with the spread of influenza B virus (IBV) and unrelated respiratory viruses in the infected host and this is thought to be due to induction of innate immune responses, particularly the IFN response [14, 16]. In contrast, DIP-mediated inhibition of IBV infection in cell culture is not observed, due to absence of genome competition [13, 14]. The absence of antiviral activity of DIPs against VSV confirms lack of genome competition. Moreover, it suggests that DIPs might not have modulated a potential IFN response in MDCK cells, although it should be noted that such a response might have been impeded due to the presence of trypsin in the culture medium [37].",
