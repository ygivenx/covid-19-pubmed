            "text": "Seoul virus (SEOV) is an emerging zoonotic virus (genus Orthohantavirus, family Hantaviridae) that may cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans [1,2]. SEOV is associated with brown (Rattus norvegicus) and black rats (Rattus rattus) as its reservoir and is found worldwide due to the geographic distribution of these rats [3]. Orthohantaviruses are usually transmitted from rodents to humans via inhalation of contaminated fomites, but can also be transmitted through bites [4]. While the respiratory route is considered the main route of transmission from rats to humans, transmission between rats has also been associated with wounding through biting and/or scratching [5]. Recent human cases of autochthonous SEOV infection in the USA, United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands were primarily associated with contact with pet rats and feeder rats [6,7,8,9]. Although SEOV has been detected in wild rats in the Netherlands [10], the spread is likely limited [11]. Human cases due to exposure to wild rats have been extensively described in Asia, however the risk of SEOV from wild rats in the Netherlands seems less prominent [12].",

Most information about the pathology of SEOV in rats and the immune response has been acquired through experimental infection [14]. Limited information is available on SEOV cell tropism, and in agreement with other orthohantaviruses, endothelial cells are an important target in these studies [16]. However, most experimental infection studies have focused on intraperitoneal inoculation as the route of experimental infection [14]. Limited data is available on the natural history of SEOV infection in rats. Previous studies with other viruses such as influenza and henipaviruses have shown that the route of inoculation may affect cell tropism and therefore it is important to compare experimental data with data acquired through natural infections [17,18]. Here we studied the tissue and cell tropism of SEOV in a cohort of naturally infected pet rats.",

Briefly, liver and lung tissues were scored randomly and blinded for the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) within the parenchyma excluding large blood vessels. In 5 randomly selected microscopic high-power fields (HPF; 400\u00d7 magnification field of an Olympus BX51 light microscope) the total number of cells were counted and presented as the number of PMNs/5HPF. Furthermore, kidney slides were scored similarly for the number of PMNs in 25 randomly selected glomeruli per animal and expressed as number of PMNs/25 glomeruli. PMNs entail both neutrophilic granulocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes, of which neutrophils were most abundant.",

Of the adult rats, SEOV RNA could primarily be detected in the lungs of all adult rats (19/19), but also in the kidneys in 79% (15/19), liver in 74% (14/19) and the blood in 74% (14/19) of the rats.

The observed poor coat condition, ear lesions and bite wounds are considered conductive for animal-to-animal transmission [5], and would explain the high prevalence of the virus in this population.

Surprisingly, one juvenile rat which was positive for orthohantavirus IgG, did not have detectable levels of SEOV RNA in any tissues tested. This finding may reflect a past infection that was resolved, however since SEOV infection is generally believed to result in a persistent infection, it is more likely that the levels of SEOV RNA in these tissues are below the level of detection, as has been reported in experimental infection models [24].",

Lung and kidney are often used as the target organs for molecular detection of orthohantaviruses in surveillance studies [11,23,25,26]. Furthermore, SEOV RNA was more often detected in saliva swabs than in rectal swabs or urine. And while infectivity of the virus in saliva was not tested in this study, this supports previous studies that biting is an important transmission route between rats [5]. However, no limit of detection has been established for the used method, and the starting volumes and quantities of the material for the swabs and urine differed, leaving the possibility for false- negative results, which complicates a real comparison of these samples.",

In the current study, only mild inflammation was observed in lungs of some SEOV infected adult rats but not in uninfected juvenile rats. However, the differences in inflammation were not significant and more likely due to differences in age and thus prolonged exposure to environmental agents as all SEOV positive animals were adults, while all negative animals were juveniles. This observed difference in severity of histopathological changes in the lungs could be due to the route of infection. In the experimental studies, rats were inoculated via the intraperitoneal route, and while the exact route of transmission in these feeder rats cannot be determined, the most likely routes would be through wounding and/or respiratory transmission. Previous studies with other viruses such as influenza and henipaviruses have already shown that the route of transmission can impact the tropism and severity of disease [17,18]. Alternatively, hemorrhage has only been reported in lungs of rat up to 30 days post infection, and no data is available from later time points. Since we do not know for how long the rats from the breeding farm have been infected, it is possible that the rats from this study exhibited similar lesions earlier during the infection, and have since resolved the inflammation.",

Limited information on SEOV infection in the liver of reservoir species has been reported, with studies mostly focussing on lung, kidney and spleen [27]. Interestingly, several studies have also reported liver involvement following SEOV infection in humans. This included acute viral hepatitis-like manifestations with lobular necrosis without viral inclusions, atypical cells, vasculitis, or fibrosis, a painful enlarged liver and distinct elevation of liver enzymes [6,28,29,30]. This suggests that SEOV may have a tropism for liver in both reservoir and diseased host. The mechanisms of pathogenesis in the liver are the focus of ongoing studies.",

With both experimental and natural infection, SEOV infections result in a persistent infection in the absence of clinical disease. Infection in the liver can lead to mild inflammation. This suggests that an infection with SEOV does cause an immune response in rats, but that the effects of this are rather limited and often go unnoticed. These results further highlight the importance of mimicking the natural route of infection for further studies into the pathogenesis of SEOV infection in its reservoir host.",
