This is because infectious agents can be transported in food of animal origin, especially those without health certificates and these can be detected in international baggage (Taniguchi et al. 2008Chaber et al. 2010) using X-ray scanners. Airborne, food-borne, vector-borne, and zoonotic infectious diseases transmitted during commercial air travel became an important public health issue due to the greater affordability of air travel, increasing the mobility of people (Mangili and Gendreau 2005). To minimize the risk of these diseases entering a country, products of animal origin need to be accompanied by an international health certificate. This is crucial to assure a reliable health situation when countries with known health status are involved, as regulated by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for its member countries (Pastoret and Chaisemartin 2011).",

With the recent increase in international travel, these authorities have to be efficient in identifying passengers bringing products of agricultural origin into Brazil (Brazil Minist\u00e9rio da Agricultura, Pecu\u00e1ria e Abastecimento 1998). Preliminary studies have shown that about 39 tonnes of illegal animal products were seized from airline passengers in a four year analyses at Guarulhos International Airport (2006 to 2009) and about 19 tonnes in a two year analyses (2008 to 2009) from Gale\u00e3o International Airport in a retrospective study (unpublished data).",

Intensive epidemiological work was carried out by researchers from various Brazilian and international institutions, involving a number of public authorities. Brazil declared an Animal Health Emergency and adopted immediate measures to contain and eradicate the disease, following recommendations of OIE. The owner of the farm was an officer stationed at Gale\u00e3o International Airport and he had collected leftovers from meals served on international flights to feed to his animals, including food from Portuguese and Spanish airlines. The direct and indirect costs of emergency actions reached US $ 13 million, including compensation for the loss of income from the slaughter of 66,902 pigs. Thus, emergency action also caused unemployment in 2,000 families who depended on pig farming in the region (Moura et al. 2010).",

These diseases included: Classical Swine Fever in 1866, Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in 1895 and Rinderpest in 1921. During this period, every 15 months a new disease or nosological agent entered Brazilian territory. This was compounded in the late 1970s, with the notification of 27 new diseases, including African Swine Fever. It is believed that this growing trend occurred due to the greater vigilance by the veterinary services that were structured in most states during this period and the consequent increase in health surveillance (Moura et al., 2010).",

Measures need to be taken, therefore, to restrict the entrance of infectious agents into the country in baggage of international air passengers. To get an idea of the scale of the increase in movement during the FIFA World Cup, between June and July 2014 the National Civil Aviation Agency has authorized Brazilian airlines to operate 1,973 new flights in this short period, and authorized changes in approximately 80,000 existing flights. The number of created and modified flights will impact on about 42% of the Brazilian airline network (ANAC National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil 2014).",

Since 1984, researchers have warned that the increase in air travel and the volume of air freight had considerably increased the risk of introduction of a foreign animal disease in most areas of the world (Sutm\u00f6ller 1984). In Sydney International Airport, a research detected Plum pox potyvirus (PPV) in an illegal consignment of plum budwood and fruit intercepted by Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) inspectors (Davi et al. 2002). PPV was detected in leaf, bark and peduncle tissue. Recently, another study in Sydney International Airport, evaluated the possibility of introduction of a new West Nile Virus (WNV) strain in the country through mosquitos via international aircraft from United States, and concluded that the risk of introduction and spread of an exotic strain of WNV from the U.S via aircraft was low (Hern\u00e1ndez-Jover et al. 2013).",
