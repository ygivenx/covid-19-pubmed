Due to the emerging high healthcare cost and severe consequences of SARI, effective vaccination is needed to reduce the incidence of SARI caused by influenza [6,7,8]. Therefore, whether influenza epidemiological and virological characteristics among SARI patients were consistent to those of ILI patients is critical to the effectiveness of current vaccination plan.

As for four SARI sentinel hospitals, the number of SARI and total admissions from pediatrics ward, the respiratory medicine ward and the intensive care unit were also reported. All of the reported numbers in the above-mentioned departments were required to record by age classified as 0-, 5-, 15-, 25-, and 60- years old. Nasopharyngeal or throat swabs were required to collect from all of SARI cases and 5\u201315 ILI cases of each sentinel hospital on every week. The collection of swabs was conducted by trained nurses from who had not received antiviral drugs. In addition, a standardized case report form containing demographic and sample information was also required to complete among whose biological samples had been collected. Due to the outbreak of avian influenza A(H7N9) in April 2013, ILI surveillance was strengthened by increasing the weekly number of the biological samples collected in each hospital from 5\u201315 to 20. The biological samples were collected and saved in cryovial tubes, stored at 4 \u00b0C at the sentinel site, and then sent to regional center for disease control and prevention (CDC) within 48 h after the sample collected. The regional CDC laboratory tested influenza using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay following the standard protocols. Specimens tested as positive for influenza A were further tested for subtypes (i.e., A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H7N9)) using specific rRT-PCR. Once the laboratory complete, regional CDC submitted the laboratory results to the online surveillance system.",

Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to analyze the trend change of influenza virus positivity with the increase of age. Spearman correlation was applied to analyze the linear relationship of the influenza virus positive rate, weekly percentage of influenza virus subtypes accounted for all the positive numbers between SARI and ILI patients. ILI percentage was calculated as the percentage of total outpatient visits that were due to ILI and SARI percentage was calculated as the percentage of total admissions that were due to SARI. To compare ILI percentage and SARI percentage of which can better reflect the activity of influenza virus among outpatients and inpatients, Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the linear relationship between weekly ILI influenza-positive rate and ILI percentage, as well as weekly SARI percentage and SARI influenza-positive rate.

The simple and preferred measure to assess and compare seasonality patterns was the proportion of influenza positives [27]. The highly correlated influenza virus positive rate between SARI and ILI patients demonstrated the similar temporal pattern of influenza activity in the two groups. Similar findings were recently reported in a description of influenza surveillance in Egypt, which showed that the seasonality of influenza among ILI cases and SARI cases was consisted in November\u2013February [19]. Moreover, the comparison between ILI patients and SARI patients shows no statistically significantly difference in detecting influenza virus type and influenza A virus subtype, which was similar to the findings from Nigeria [16]. Finally, the correlation of weekly percentage of influenza virus type/subtypes accounted for all the positive numbers between SARI and ILI patients indicated that the predominant influenza types/subtypes among ILI and SARI cases was corresponded. These findings are essential for planning influenza vaccination programmes for those severe cases given recommendations for strain inclusion within the vaccine are based on the ILI surveillance system. Our results were consistent to the study conducted by Peng et al. in the year of 2015 [4]. But in that study, the detailed analyses such as correlation analysis between weekly ILI influenza-positive rate and SARI influenza-positive rate, ILI percentage and ILI influenza-positive rate, SARI percentage and SARI influenza-positive rate were not performed. Therefore, we believe the present study can provide more comprehensive information on the comparison of influenza epidemiological and virological characteristics between outpatients and inpatients.",

Moreover, we also found the correlation coefficient of ILI percentage and ILI influenza-positive rate was higher than that of SARI percentage and SARI influenza-positive rate. These phenomena may due to the higher specificity of the ILI diagnosis compared to the SARI diagnosis [28]. Some studies have demonstrated that influenza played an important role in the viral aetiologies of ILI cases [29,30,31], while other respiratory virus such as respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human bocavirus were essential for the cause of SARI, especially in children [32,33]. This indicated that it is more necessary to conduct pathogen spectrum test for SARI cases so as to accurately understand the cause of those severe cases.",

The detection rate of A(H7N9) virus in the SARI patients was higher than that in the ILI patients because this strain frequently cause severe syndromes. However, our study found that the surveillance network has low sensitivity on the capture of patients infected with A(H7N9) virus. Although one of the critical functions of influenza surveillance is to detect novel strains of influenza, the rapid detection of emerging novel influenza strains or outbreaks of respiratory disease calls for other surveillance with standardized methodology [5].",

First, although SARI surveillance was required to catch all patients in accordance with the definition, sometimes the cases may not be fully recorded because of physicians\u2019 oversights and absenteeism. In the ILI surveillance, to get all ILI patients surveyed was impossible due to the limited amount of resources and personnel. Therefore, the subject chosen for ILI sampled may prone to sicker patients or younger patients. Second, compared to ILI surveillance, SARI surveillance may be less representative due to its sparse surveillance sites. In the future, we should consider to expand and to enhance the coverage of the surveillance network, with priority to choose hospitals from ILI surveillance. Third, we did not test for pathogens other than influenza, which made us unable to exclude other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens that could be the causes of ILI and SARI.",
