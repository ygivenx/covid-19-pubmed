            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important liver pathogen belonging to the Flaviviridae family with an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA genome. HCV has seven genotypes (genotype 1~7) and a genome size of about 9.6 kb which encodes a polyprotein that is approximately 3000 amino acids long. The polyprotein upon translation is processed by viral and host proteases to yield 10 matured protein including structural proteins, Core, E1, E2, and p7 ion channel, as well as non-structural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [1]. HCV entry into the host hepatocytes is mediated by interaction with several notable cell surface and tight junction receptors/co-receptors including heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), cluster of differentiation 81 (CD81), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), claudin-1 (CLDN1), and occludin (OCLN) [2,3]. Additional factors that can influence viral entry include apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is incorporated on infectious HCV virions [4], and can function as an exchangeable apolipoprotein between secreted ApoE-associated lipoproteins and the HCV lipoviroparticle (LVP) to enhanced HCV infection [5].",

            "text": "There are over 170 million HCV carriers worldwide. HCV infection can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, and there is still no effective vaccine against the virus. While the previous standard of care consisting of PEGylated-interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 in combination with ribavirin is associated with several important drawbacks including severe side effects and low efficacy against HCV genotype 1, the recent introduction of the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting the viral non-structural proteins has substantially improved the sustained virological response (SVR) in the most difficult to treat genotype 1 patients [6]. However, the DAAs also have challenges including potential toxicity, especially from drug-drug interactions (DDIs). For instance, HCV protease inhibitors are at high risk for DDIs as they are known substrates and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 system and can interfere with the metabolism of other drugs including immunosuppressants (e.g. cyclosporine and tacrolimus) when co-administered in liver transplant setting [7]. Other drug-drug interactions from HCV DAAs include those with acid-suppression therapies (e.g. famotidine and omeprazole) or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiretroviral agents (e.g. Rilpivirine and Efavirenz), which have been shown to decrease the effectiveness of the HCV NS5A inhibitor Ledipasvir [8] and produce adverse drug reactions with the protease inhibitor Paritaprevir [7], respectively. In addition, due to the great genetic variability of HCV, selection of resistant mutants is becoming a challenge as a greater number of people are being treated in real-world settings, which can potentially lead to DAA failures [6,9]. Therefore, continuous identification of novel candidate drugs particularly with a different mode of action to improve the current therapeutic strategies is highly envisaged.",

RC is one of the most commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs (also known as \u2018Huang Lian\u2019) documented by the WHO [10] and is known to contain various bioactive alkaloids [11]. It is traditionally used for its \u201cheat clearing\u201d and \u201cdetoxification\u201d effects such as treatment against arthritis, burns, eczema, microbial infections, and gastrointestinal diseases [10,12,13]. In addition, RC\u2019s traditional usage against infections has been correlated through several recent studies that validated its antimicrobial functions, including against several bacteria and viruses [13]. Specifically, RC and its major constituents have been shown to exert inhibitory effects against herpesvirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and mouse hepatitis A virus infections [14,15,16]. These precedents suggest that RC may be a potent source for the discovery of novel antiviral treatments. Since the effect of RC on HCV infection remains largely unexplored, and in an attempt to identify novel anti-HCV agents, in this study we examined the impact of the methanolic extract of RC on HCV infection. Our results demonstrated that RC could robustly inhibit HCV infection by targeting the early steps in viral entry. Specifically, the targeted steps included viral attachment and entry/fusion into the host cells. In addition, the RC-mediated inhibition of HCV is not genotype-specific as the drug equally inhibits other HCV genotypes, thereby identifying RC as a potential pan-genotypic anti-HCV agent.",

Only a moderate decrease in viral infectivity was observed when the drug was added after the establishment of viral infection. In contrast, IFN-\u03b1, which served as positive control, effectively inhibited the HCVcc infection in all 3 types of treatment.

The drug-virus mixture was then diluted 20X to yield a non-effective concentration which was subsequently added to the cells and incubated for 3 days. Luciferase readings following 3 days of incubation showed no significant difference between samples treated with or without RC, suggesting that the drug does not impact the free viral particles (Figure 3A).

Results demonstrated a significant decrease in the luciferase reporter activity, which indicated that RC interfered with the attachment of the virus to the host cells (Figure 3A). To ascertain whether RC influenced the post-attachment viral entry/fusion step, Huh-7.5 cells were pre-bound with HCV at 4 \u00b0C before shifting the temperature to 37 \u00b0C in the presence of RC.

Results showed a significant decrease in viral infection across all the tested HCV genotypes when RC was present, suggesting that it may possess a pan-genotypic activity against HCV (Figure 4).",

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that the methanolic extract of RC robustly inhibited HCV infection. Specifically, RC mainly targeted the HCV early viral entry steps such as attachment and entry/fusion to the host cells. Interestingly, RC also inhibited HCV infection of several other genotypes. Our results therefore identified RC as a promising antagonist with pan-genotypic function against HCV entry, which could be useful for developing HCV prophylaxis.",

Importantly, donor livers inadvertently become re-infected almost immediately after transplantation in hepatitis C patients [29]. Given that the DAAs in current use cannot prevent liver graft re-infection and have the propensity to select for drug-resistant mutants, combining entry inhibitors with the DAAs would be expected to broaden the treatment strategies against hepatitis C especially in the liver transplant setting. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that combining DAAs and virus entry inhibitors can produce a synergistic effect to improve drug efficacy [30]. Our discovery that RC can antagonize HCV entry makes it an ideal candidate for use in liver transplant scenarios and to test in combination with the DAAs for better therapeutic efficacy.",

RC\u2019s anti-HCV bioactivity identifies the medicinal herb as an important antiviral source for the treatment of hepatitis C. Various medicinal plant extracts have been shown to possess anti-HCV properties and thereafter served as source for further identifying small molecule inhibitors. Examples of those that specifically target HCV entry include silibinin and silymarin from Silybum marianum [32,33], gallic acid found in Limonium sinense [22], loliolide and the butenolide (4R,6S)-2-dihydromenisdaurilide derived from Phyllanthus urinaria [28,34], ladanein isolated from Marrubium peregrinum L. (Lamiaceae) [35], and Bupleurum kaoi and its terpenoid saikosaponin b2 [23]. While the molecular constituents in RC contributing to its anti-HCV activity remain to be identified, the alkaloids are potential candidate bioactives which are known to be the major components of RC and are typically present in the alcoholic extracts of the herb [11]. Examples include berberine, coptisine, palmatine, epiberberine, columbamine, jatrorrhizine, and groenlandicine, among other major compounds [11]. Whether a single compound or a combination of them contributes to RC\u2019s antiviral actions against HCV remains to be explored. Further in-depth analysis would be required to fully elucidate the bioactive ingredients responsible for RC\u2019s anti-HCV effect.",

The ability of RC to inhibit HCVpp infection suggests that its mechanistic target(s) may involve the HCV glycoproteins-mediated interactions with the host cell. A potential mechanism is the transient interaction(s) with the HCV glycoproteins that are inadequate to inactivate free viral particles but sufficiently effective to hinder contact with cell surface receptors/co-receptors. Additional mechanisms of action could also include concentration-dependent reversible conformational alterations in receptors/co-receptors or viral particles\u2019 structure to block viral entry. We also noted a moderate effect from RC in the post-infection stage (Figure 2), albeit less pronounced compared to its impact in inhibiting HCV entry steps. This effect was not entirely due to inhibition of entry in subsequent de novo infection cycles, since treatment of subgenomic HCV replicon cells with RC also showed a moderate decrease in viral RNA in a preliminary experiment (Figure S1). It is possible that RC may possess multiple mechanisms against HCV infection, which would necessitate further studies for clarification. Nonetheless, our results clearly demonstrated that RC most potently inhibited HCV entry. Therefore, we suggest that RC could be further explored for prophylactic/therapeutic management of hepatitis C.",
