Other mechanisms of viral inhibition by chloroquine, such as inhibition of polynucleotidyl transferases have, however, been considered [7]. In 2003\u20132005, chloroquine was studied as a promising in vitro anti-SARS agent [9-11] and recently entered clinical trials against chikungunya fever [12].",

Chloroquine inhibition of both type A and B influenza viruses was first described in the 1980s [13,14]. The concentrations employed in these studies were however too high to allow a theoretical transposition to in-vivo settings. Anecdotal reports of clinical benefits derived from a related compound, i.e. quinine, date back to the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918/19. However, it was not until last year that the anti-influenza virus effects of chloroquine at clinically achievable concentrations were studied, in view of a possible application of this drug in the clinical management of influenza [4,15]. Investigations still have to be done on this topic. For example, the mechanisms of orthomyxovirus inhibition by chloroquine have been uncertain at the clinically achievable concentrations adopted in the most recent studies [4,15], as well as the effects of chloroquine on field isolates, including avian strains potentially transmittable to humans.",

To investigate whether the discrepancies with the inhibitory values reported above were due to the type of virus or to the different conditions and methods adopted, we tested the effects of chloroquine on replication of recent human H3N2 and H1N1 viral isolates under conditions similar to those adopted for the H5N9 avian influenza virus. Using the test of inhibition of viral cytopathogenicity, we found that chloroquine inhibited the H3N2 virus (10 4 TCID50/ml) with an EC50 of 1.53 \u03bcM (Fig.1c). Inhibition was confirmed using qRRT-PCR, both under similar conditions and at lower MOIs (Fig.1d), thus confirming the results of Ooi et al. (the assay adopted by these authors employs a lower MOI than routinely used by our group). Results obtained with H1N1 viruses (104 TCID50/ml) showed a similar drug susceptibility for the human strain (EC50 = 1.26 \u03bcM), in full agreement with Ooi et al. [15], but no response to clinically achievable drug concentrations in an avian strain (IC50 > 20 \u03bcM; data not shown). These data suggest a more pronounced inhibitory effect of chloroquine on human H3N2 and H1N1 viruses than on avian H5N9 virus replication.",

The two viral strains showed a marked discrepancy in the response to chloroquine. In particular, A/Mallard/It/43/01 (H7N3) virus, which had been shown to be relatively more independent from pH increase than A/Ty/It/220158/02 virus [16], was insensitive to clinically achievable chloroquine concentrations (EC50 > 20 \u03bcM). In contrast, chloroquine exerted some inhibitory effect on A/Ty/It/220158/02 replication (EC50 = 14.39 \u03bcM), although the response of this virus to chloroquine was lower than that of H3N2 virus. The different pH requirements of the two viruses were confirmed by the different responses to NH4Cl (0% inhibition for A/Mallard/It/43/01; 30% inhibition for A/Ty/It/220158/02). This result raises the hypothesis that chloroquine inhibits pH-dependent events involving HA.",

Instead, no correlation was found with the isoelectric point of HA1 (P > 0.05; data not shown).

In a previous paper, the differential growth sensitivity of two naturally occurring variants of an H7N3 virus, isolated from mallards and turkeys, to increased pH values was shown to correlate with different fusion properties [16]. Since chloroquine appears to mimic the effects observed on these two viruses when pH is increased, our data support the hypothesis that the step of virus replication inhibited by clinically relevant chloroquine concentrations is the low-pH dependent haemagglutinin-mediated virus/cell fusion, in agreement with the evidence obtained by other authors at much higher concentrations than those used in this study [13,14]. The correspondence between antiviral effects and isoelectric point of HA2 (i.e. the HA subunit mediating the fusion process) is also consistent with this mechanism. Acidic pH in the endosomal compartment also activates the influenza virus ion channel, M2, that promotes the uncoating of influenza virus in endosomes. However, M2 involvement as a possible target of the antiviral effect of chloroquine is unlikely, since no aminoacid differences were observed in M2 trans-membrane region (the ion-channel domain) between the two avian H7N3 viruses with different chloroquine sensitivities, as already reported [16].",
