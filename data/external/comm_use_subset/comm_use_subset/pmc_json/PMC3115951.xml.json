            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAV) are negative sense segmented RNA genome viruses [1], [2] which can rapidly develop resistance to the drugs available against them [3]. These viruses pose a continuing threat of pandemics, thus it is imperative to develop novel strategies to prevent their infection and spread [4]. Interactions between viral proteins and host factors are often crucial for successful replication of the virus in host cells [5]. Many of these interactions are aimed at overcoming the early innate immune response of infected cells against the virus [6]. Mammalian cells respond to viral infections through several innate immune mechanisms [7]. One such crucial antiviral mechanism is activation of PKR (a dsRNA dependent protein kinase) which is phosphorylated upon encountering viral dsRNA [8]. Activated PKR has several downstream substrates, one of which is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha subunit (eIF2\u03b1) [9]\u2013[11]. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by activated PKR renders it unable to participate in translation initiation leading to translation arrest and inhibition of protein synthesis from viral mRNAs [12], [13]. Another effector function of PKR is activation of transcription factor IRF3, which leads to the expression of IFN \u03b2 and inhibition of virus replication [14], [15]. Being such a crucial component of the host innate immune system, PKR is tightly regulated by cellular inhibitors [16] and very often targeted by viral proteins [17]\u2013[20]. For example, the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus directly binds to PKR and prevents its activation [21], [22]. Apart from PKR inhibition, NS1 is also involved in the inhibition of other cellular signaling cascades, which lead to the activation of anti-viral interferon response [23], [24]. PKR activity is also inhibited by a cellular 58 kDa protein, P58IPK, which promotes influenza viral replication [25], [26]. In na\u00efve cells, P58IPK exists in an inactive state in a complex with heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40), which becomes active upon release from this complex [27]. Influenza virus infection leads to the dissociation of P58IPK from Hsp40 and suppression of the PKR response [28], [29]. However, neither the viral component nor the mechanism responsible for this event is known to-date.",

            "text": "Segment 5 of the influenza virus genome encodes for 498 amino acids Nucleoprotein (NP) whose primary function is viral genome encapsidation [30]. Apart from that, NP is also known to interact with several viral and host factors and play additional roles in the viral life cycle [31]\u2013[37]. We were interested in identifying new cellular interactors of NP from a highly virulent A/H5N1 bird-flu isolate {A/Hatay/2004(H5N1)}, which may facilitate viral replication. For this a H5N1 NP was used as bait to search for novel interactors in a yeast two-hybrid system based screen of human lung cDNA library. In the screen, we identified that IAV NP interacts with human chaperone heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) [38]. Considering the known role of Hsp40 in regulation of PKR activity during influenza A virus infection [27], we explored the possibility of NP playing a regulatory role in this process. We observed that expression of IAV NP in mammalian cells lead to reduced phosphorylation of PKR and its substrate eIF2\u03b1. We thus hypothesize that influenza NP is the viral factor that facilitates the inhibition of PKR activation by releasing P58IPK from Hsp40-P58IPK complex. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that during IAV infection, the association of NP with Hsp40 coincided with the release of P58IPK from Hsp40. Also, RNAi-mediated inhibition of NP expression in IAV infected cells enhanced the phosphorylation of PKR and its downstream substrate eIF2\u03b1. NP inhibition also led to enhanced IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN \u03b2 production which may be mediated by PKR activation. Collectively, these findings identify a novel role for influenza A virus NP in blocking the PKR-dependent antiviral response in influenza A virus infected cells.",

Yeast cells (AH-109) were co-transformed with bait and prey plasmids, and selected for growth on selective L-T-H- plates supplemented with 50 mM aminotriazole. \u03b2-galactosidase positive colonies were further analyzed (Fig. S1A). Plasmids from positive colonies were isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing followed by BLAST analysis to identify their cDNA insert. The mammalian chaperone heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40/DNAJB11) was thus identified as an interacting partner of NP. The strength of the NP-Hsp40 interaction was determined using a quantitative \u03b2-galactosidase assay, and was found to be comparable to the positive control used in the assay (Fig. S1B, bars 6 and 7 respectively, p-value = 0.0668).",

A549 cells were infected with a laboratory-adapted IAV, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934/A (H1N1) influenza virus (PR8) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Although NP expression was maximal at 24 h post-infection, Hsp40 expression levels remained unchanged throughout the course of infection (Fig. 2A). Therefore, in subsequent experiments, A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1 for 24 h and lysates were prepared. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using infected and control cell extracts. PR8 NP was able to co-precipitate endogenous Hsp40 (Fig. 2B, panel 2). Conversely, Hsp40 was able to co-precipitate NP (Fig. 2B, panel 1). The NP-Hsp40 interaction was also observed when A549 cells were infected with influenza virus isolates belonging to various subtypes (Table 1). Co-immunoprecipitation of proteins from A549 cells infected with these select viral isolates showed that NP co-precipitated with Hsp40 in all cases without exception (Fig. 2C, panel 1). A phylogenetic analysis of influenza NP genes used in the experiment was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method, nucleotide model Tamura-Nei, in MEGA version 4 (Fig. S2). The diversity of changes in NP amino-acid sequences of the strains used in this study are shown in Fig. S3. The NP genes of IAV used in the study had amino-acid sequence divergence in the range of 1% to 10% from Hatay/H5N1/2004 isolate. These results clearly indicated that the NP-Hsp40 interaction was conserved among seasonal human, avian H5N1 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A viruses.",

We transfected A549 cells with IAV NP expressing plasmid for 24 h, and an immunofluorescence staining was performed with specific antibodies. Results showed that NP and cellular Hsp40 colocalize primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, Lower right panel). Similar results were obtained with A549 cells infected with PR8 virus.

We hypothesized that NP might disrupt the P58IPK-Hsp40 complex too and liberate P58IPK. To investigate this possibility, we monitored changes in the cellular levels of P58IPK and NP associated with Hsp40 during IAV infection. A549 cells were infected with the PR8 virus, harvested at different time points after infection and immunoprecipitation was conducted using equal amounts of total protein and anti-Hsp40 antibody. Western blot analysis revealed that between 4 and 8 h post-infection, the levels of NP associated with Hsp40 continued to rise (Fig. 4B, panel 1) with a concomitant decline in P58IPK associated with Hsp40 (Fig. 4B, panel 2). During this period, total amounts of Hsp40 and P58IPK remained constant (Fig. 4B, panel 5, 6). These results were consistent with the hypothesis of replacement of P58IPK from Hsp40, by NP. These findings indicate that the dissociation of P58IPK-Hsp40 complex occurs around 4 to 8 h post-infection, and is associated with downregulation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that during IAV infection, NP induces the dissociation of the P58IPK-Hsp40 complex leading to an inhibition of PKR activation and downregulation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.",

Results from our study indicated that NP may also play a role in inhibiting PKR activity by intercepting this pathway at the level of Hsp40. To examine this aspect, we performed a time course study in HEK293T cells transfected with the plasmid expressing IAV H5N1 NP by monitoring p-eIF2\u03b1 and p-PKR levels. Western blot analysis of transfected cell lysate showed downregulation of both PKR and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which began as early as 12 h and was most prominent at 36 h post-transfection (Fig. S4 A, B). The 36 h time-point was selected to confirm this action of NP, and Western blot analysis results from 3 independent experiments showed significant reduction in the levels of p-PKR (Fig. 5A, panel 2 and Fig. 5B) and p-eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 5C, panel 2 and Fig. 5D). To confirm the PKR inhibitory action of NP, we transfected HEK293T cells with NP-GFP expressing plasmid and inhibited NP expression using specific siRNA (Table 2) against it (Fig. S5A). Inhibition of NP expression led to an increase in p-PKR and p-eIF2\u03b1 levels as compared to control NP-GFP transfected cells (Fig. S5B). These results suggest that the expression of NP leads to inhibition of PKR activity in a NS1 independent manner. This action of IAV NP is likely to be mediated through its interaction with Hsp40.",

To check the further downstream effect of NP, we suppressed the expression of NP using siRNAs as mentioned earlier. 24 hours post-infection, the cells were harvested and RNA was isolated to determine IFN\u03b2 and viral RNA levels by real-time PCR using gene-specific primers. The inhibition of NP expression led to increased IFN\u03b2 production as compared to control (Fig. 7A, bar 2, 3). Furthermore, the inhibition of NS1 had greater impact on IFN\u03b2 production as compared to that of NP, and there was a synergistic effect when both NS1 and NP were inhibited (Fig. 7A, bar 4, 5). Increased IFN\u03b2 production should lead to reduced virus replication and reduced production of Influenza vRNA. To confirm this, influenza vRNA levels in the above mentioned samples were measured by real-time PCR. Inhibition of NP or NS1 led to reduced vRNA production as compared to control (Fig. 7A, bar 2, 3, 4), and inhibition of both NP and NS1 together had greater synergistic effect (Fig. 7B, bar 5).",

The Hsp40 family chaperones are known to play important roles in protein folding, translocation, cell signaling and apoptosis [40]\u2013[42]. Very often they are targeted by viral components for successful virus replication. For example, Hsp40 is known to interact with HIV type 2 Vpx protein and facilitate nuclear import of the pre-integration complex [43]. HIV type 1 Nef protein interacts with Hsp40 to enhance viral gene expression [44]. Hsp40 is also known to interact with the HBV core protein and affect viral turnover [45]. Heat shock proteins are known to affect the viral replication of influenza viruses also. For example Hsp90 is known to interact with influenza virus polymerase components and aid in viral RNA synthesis [46]. Hsp70 is also known to be involved in the nuclear export of the RNP complex and play a role in temperature dependence of IAV replication [47], [48]. Likewise, Hsp40 is also known to regulate PKR signaling in influenza virus infected cells [25]. Similarly, the IAV NP is also a multifunctional protein that interacts with a wide variety of viral and cellular macromolecules, including RNA, PB1 and PB2 subunits of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the viral matrix protein [30]\u2013[33]. It also binds to several host factors which include CRM1, UAP56, Alpha-importin 1 and NF90 [33]\u2013[37]. Through these interactions, IAV-NP is known to encapsidate the viral genome, regulate virus transcription and replication, contribute towards pathogenicity of virus, and help in interspecies transmission of the virus [30]. However, so far IAV NP is not reported to play any role in modulating the host antiviral response.",

            "text": "A key component of mammalian antiviral response mechanism is dsRNA dependent protein kinase PKR, which is activated by viral dsRNA [8]. Upon activation, PKR gets dimerized and autophosphorylated at multiple serine and threonine residues. Activated PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, which in phosphorylated state cannot participate in mRNA translation [12]. This is an important strategy of the host to arrest translation of viral mRNAs thereby limiting viral replication [9], [13]. Another crucial host pathway which is activated by PKR is IRF3-mediated IFN\u03b2 production. Activation of PKR is known to enhance IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear movement where it drives expression of Interferon \u03b2 production and built up of antiviral host response [14]. Similarly, PKR also has other substrates such as MAPK and iKK\u00df which upon phosphorylation trigger various signaling pathways leading to apoptosis or interferon response [10], [11]. Being such a crucial molecule, PKR is very often the target of viral factors [15]\u2013[18]. In case of influenza virus infection, viral NS1 protein is known to bind directly to PKR and inhibit its activation [20], [21]. NS1 also inhibits the function of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), a cytosolic pathogen sensor involved in the antiviral response [49]. Apart from that, PKR activity is controlled by another mechanism where P58IPK, the cellular inhibitor of PKR is activated in influenza virus infected cells [25], [28]. Further, P58IPK itself is inhibited by Hsp40 and is present as P58IPK-Hsp40 complex under normal conditions. However upon influenza virus infection, it is released from the Hsp40 complex and inhibits PKR activation [24]. In a recent report, it was shown that M2 protein of influenza A virus stabilizes the P58IPK-Hsp40 complex and activates PKR phosphorylation, probably during later stage of infection [50]. However the mechanism of dissociation of Hsp40-P58IPK complex and concomitant PKR inhibition during influenza virus infection remain unknown.",

            "text": "Here, we report that IAV NP interacts with the human chaperone Hsp40 and employs this interaction to mitigate PKR-mediated antiviral response of the host. NP-Hsp40 interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed in a cell-free translation system, in transfected cells and in influenza virus infected cells. The interaction was found to be conserved across different influenza A viruses, ranging from seasonal, avian H5N1 virus and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus despite substantial amino acid differences that range from 0\u20135% within a subtype/group and 6\u201310% between the subgroups in NP amino-acid sequence. Our findings demonstrate that IAV NP is the viral component that dissociates P58IPK from the P58IPK-Hsp40 complex during influenza virus infection in mammalian cells. It was observed that during the course of influenza virus infection in lung epithelial cells, a gradual increase in the association of NP with Hsp40 coincided with a concomitant decrease in P58IPK association with Hsp40. Increased activity of P58IPK, promoted by NP, should lead to the inhibition of PKR activation and subsequent downstream effects (Fig. 8). In accordance with the above hypothesis, we observed that ectopic expression of IAV NP in mammalian cells substantially reduced the phosphorylation levels of PKR and eIF2\u03b1. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated inhibition of NP expression during influenza virus infection led to increased phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2\u03b1, confirming the role of NP in the negative regulation of PKR. Although eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated by other kinases also, namely, HRI, GCN2 and PERK which are activated during stress condition, only PKR is known to be targeted by viral inhibitors [12]. In line with this, NP and NS1 had similar effects on PKR mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation; however their synergistic effect was higher than their individual effects (Fig. 6 B).",

            "text": "Activation of PKR signaling during virus infections is known to result in IRF3 phosphorylation and concomitant IFN\u03b2 production. However IRF3 is not a direct substrate of PKR and it can get activated by the RIG I pathway, NF\u03baB pathway and other unknown mechanisms [14], [15]. Influenza NS1 protein is known to inhibit PKR, RIG I and NF\u03baB pathways, thus it is expected to have greater impact on IRF3 phosphorylation as compared to NP, which may inhibit only PKR mediated IRF3 phosphorylation [23], [24]. In line with this, we observed that NP inhibition during IAV infection led to enhanced IRF3 phosphorylation, IFN\u03b2 production and reduced viral replication; however inhibition of NS1 had greater impact on these events. As expected the synergistic effect of NP and NS1 inhibition on IRF3 activity was higher than their individual effects. The effect of NP on IFN\u03b2 production is also reflected on virus replication as siRNA-mediated inhibition of NP led to reduced vRNA production. This effect may also be attributed to the essential requirement of NP for proper functioning of influenza virus polymerase. However the inhibitory action of NP on PKR-mediated host response may also contribute to the reduced virus replication in case of siRNA-mediated inhibition of NP.",

            "text": "Based on our findings, we proposed a model for PKR inhibition by influenza virus nucleoprotein as shown in Fig. 7. According to this model, IAV NP interacts with Hsp40 and facilitates the release of P58IPK from it, which in turn inhibits PKR activation (Fig. 8). Reduced PKR activity, on one hand leads to reduced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ensures continued translation from viral mRNAs and on the other hand leads to reduced IRF3 mediated IFN\u03b2 production. Therefore, apart from the NS1 protein which is already known to inhibit PKR activation and IRF3 phosphorylation [21], [24], NP also participates in this process, but through a different mechanism involving Hsp40. With structure information of both NP and Hsp40 being available [30], [42], it would be interesting to see which domains and key amino-acid residues are involved in this interaction. Since the NP-Hsp40 interaction is conserved across influenza viruses of various subtypes including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, it serves as an important target for developing anti-viral strategies.",

Cells were harvested at 24 hours post-infection, RNA was isolated, cDNA was synthesized and real-time PCR was set up using primer specific for IFN\u03b2 and influenza NP vRNA. mRNA levels were normalized against \u03b2 actin, and the result from triplicate experiments were plotted with standard deviation. A. Graph shows the effect of NP and/or NS1 inhibition on IFN\u03b2 production. B. Graph shows the effect of NP and/or NS1 silencing on NP vRNA production, which is a measure of virus replication.",

As a result, there is an increased amount of free P58IPK available in the cell which prevents PKR activation. Downregulation in PKR activity ensures less eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and continued translation from viral mRNAs. On the other hand reduced PKR activity also leads to reduced IRF3 activation and subsequent IFN\u03b2 production.",
