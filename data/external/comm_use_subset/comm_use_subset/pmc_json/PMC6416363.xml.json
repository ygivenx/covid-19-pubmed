Transmissible gastroenteritis virus is a highly contagious virus that causes enteric disease characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea, and high mortality in piglets in TGEV/PRCV-naive herds. The virus was first described by Doyle and Hutchings in 1946 in the United States and subsequently reported worldwide (1\u20133). Porcine respiratory coronavirus is a naturally occurring spike gene deletion (170 to 190 kDa) mutant of TGEV first isolated in Belgium in 1984 (4). It infects the upper respiratory tract, tonsils, or lungs, with limited intestinal replication (4, 5). Porcine respiratory coronavirus itself does not appear to be an important primary pathogen, with the exception of its contribution to the porcine respiratory disease complex (6).",

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) and multiplex microarray hybridization using primers targeting the 5\u2032 region of the S gene spanning the deletion region in PCRV strain are commonly used for the diagnosis of TGEV and differentiation of TGEV and PRCV (7\u201310). Serum antibodies provide serological evidence of TGEV or PRCV infection, but PRCV-infected pigs produce antibodies that cross-react and cross-neutralize TGEV, i.e., conventional serological tests cannot differentiate between TGEV- and PRCV-infected animals. This presents a complication for TGEV seroprevalence studies and serological surveys of sows or slaughterhouse swine tested for international trade (5).",

Moreover, the percentage of TGEV-false-positive results reported by the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than those obtained with the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA (14, 21, and 35 dpi) and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (21 to 35 dpi).",

            "text": "The greatest risk of introducing TGEV is through the importation of pigs from endemically infected countries. Seronegative pigs of all ages are susceptible to infection with TGEV (1, 21, 22), with the route of infection typically being oral or oral-nasal (23, 24). To prevent TGEV from entering a naive herd, it is important to introduce only animals from TGEV-free and serologically negative herds, along with disciplined biosecurity. Therefore, quarantine and testing for TGEV-seronegative animals are requirements for export/import into a herd. Moreover, the detection of TGEV antibodies, particularly in reproductive animals, can assist in diagnosis and control of the disease. However, TGEV serology is complicated by cross-reactivity with PRCV (5), an S protein deletion mutant of TGEV with altered tissue tropism (nonenteropathogenic but respiratory) that circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide (7, 9, 25). This cross-reactivity may explain why a region endemic for PRCV has less TGEV-associated disease (26). Porcine respiratory coronavirus does not cause significant losses in swine except for its contribution to the porcine respiratory disease complex. Historically, PRCV diagnosis was based on recognition of respiratory disease in growing pigs that have high antibody titers to TGEV but have had no clinical enteric disease or lesions of atrophic enteritis. Conventional serological tests, such as virus neutralization, indirect fluorescent antibody, agar-gel precipitation, indirect immunoperoxidase, radioimmunoprecipitation, and some ELISAs based on polyclonal TGEV antibodies, cannot be used for differentiation between TGEV and PRCV, because the two viruses share antigenic determinants located on the spike (S), membrane (M), nucleoprotein (N), and envelope (E) structural proteins (27, 28). The exception is a large deletion (227 amino acids in length) in the amino terminus of the PRCV S protein that is responsible for the loss of hemagglutination activity (29). This deletion provided the opportunity to develop blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for differentiation of PRCV and TGEV infections and laid the basis for the commercial TGEV/PRCV differential ELISAs that are currently available (17\u201320). Few field reports have described the use of TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs to differentiate antibodies to TGEV and PRCV and their utility at the herd level (26, 30, 31). However, no previous reports have compared the diagnostic performances of different commercially available TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs. In this study, we assessed and compared the diagnostic performances (sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity) of three commercial differential TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISA kits (i.e., Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA [Biovet, Canada]; INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA [Ingenasa, Spain]; and Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA kit [Svanova, Sweden]) at the individual pig level using experimental samples of precisely known porcine coronavirus immune status. The use of samples with the same disease/immune status allowed for accurate interpretation of test results, including those that were discordant or unexpected.",

Specimens primarily used for TGEV virus detection include feces and intestinal contents, and those for PRCV detection include nasal swabs or lung homogenates. In this study, the verification and monitoring of the TGEV or PRCV viral shedding status were performed using rRT-PCR testing of pen-based feces and oral fluids. This process provided further information on the dynamics of viral shedding in feces versus oral fluids. Viral shedding was detected in both feces and oral fluids. However, for pigs inoculated with PRCV and, interestingly, for TGEV Purdue, virus shedding was only detected in oral fluids. This could be related to differences in pathogenicity and tissue tropism, which were beyond the scope of this study. These results indicated that oral fluids may replace feces as a more suitable specimen for direct detection and surveillance of TGEV/PRCV by rRT-PCR.",

However, the differences were more marked for the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA kit, compared to either the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA or the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA, for which test performance was comparable. This could be due to differences/similarities in assay design. For instance, both the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA and the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA use a TGEV recombinant S protein antigen on a plate, while the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA claims to use noninfectious TGEV antigen of an unknown source, which could detect antibodies to a variety of viral proteins. The way the antigen is presented may also affect assay performance. The antigen can either be bound directly to the plate wells (as in the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA and Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA) or may be captured by antigen-specific antibodies immobilized on the plate (as in the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA). In addition, the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA is the only kit using unlabeled TGEV and TGEV/PRCV mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), which requires an additional incubation step with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. Undisclosed differences in buffer composition could also be involved in the differences in assay performance among the kits.",

The differences in diagnostic sensitivity among TGEV-inoculated groups could be due to strain-related differences in virulence, which may have impacted the magnitude of the immune response.

All three kits evaluated in this study showed excellent diagnostic specificity, ranging from 99% (Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA) to 100% (Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA). These results were consistent with previous reports in the field where a TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISA (i.e., Swinecheck and Biovet) showed a diagnostic specificity of 100% in wild boar populations historically free from coronavirus disease (34). With the final goal of maximizing both diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (but understanding that there is a balance between the two parameters), diagnostic specificity is of paramount importance during TGEV/PRCV screening due to the impact of false-positive results on global pig trade operations. The false-positive rate of any diagnostic test is a function of the specificity of the test and the prevalence of the disease.",

Specifically, in this study, the analysis of the analytical specificity was circumscribed to the cross-reactivity between TGEV (strains Purdue and Miller) and PRCV. However, the potential cross-reactivity between TGEV/PRCV against other swine coronaviruses has previously been reported (35). A test was considered analytically specific for TGEV or PRCV when it did not react against heterologous positive sera. As with the diagnostic sensitivity, the overall analytical specificity varied among and across kits and groups of inoculation, even with intrakit variations depending upon the interpretation of suspect results. Serological cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV was previously reported by use of an immunoblotting assay based on TGEV/PRCV structural proteins (S, M, and N) and polyclonal antisera (11). This study further confirms that the serological cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV is significant even when using TGEV/PRCV differential blocking ELISAs. Overall, in this study, we observed a poor analytical specificity (i.e., high cross-reactivity) for PRCV antibody detection in pigs exposed to TGEV strain Purdue (63 to 72%), with no significant differences among kits. However, with the exception of the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA (76 to 84%), we found an acceptable analytical specificity for PRCV antibody detection in pigs exposed to TGEV Miller using the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA (91 to 92%) and the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (95%). Current TGEV/PRCV differential immunoassays are based on a blocking ELISA format, which is inherently more specific than indirect ELISAs. In the blocking ELISA format, the degree to which specific antibodies in the test serum sample prevent binding of an agent-specific MAb is measured. Therefore, the higher the levels of specific antibodies are in a serum sample, the lower the likelihood for cross-reactivity. In fact, the overall higher TGEV antibody detection rate observed within the group inoculated with TGEV strain Miller correlates with the lower cross-reactivity against PRCV. That would also explain the overall higher rate of serologic cross-reactivity (regardless of the ELISA kit used) reported during the first few weeks postinoculation, when specific antibody levels are still low.",

We have demonstrated that interpretation of suspect results can impact significantly the diagnostic performance of any of the commercial kits evaluated in this study, with differences in their robustness in response to changes in the interpretation of suspect results. While analytical specificity improved overall when suspect results were interpreted as negative, this often comes at the cost of diagnostic sensitivity. In the event of suspect, undetermined, or unexpected positive results, it is recommended that serology testing on paired serum samples be conducted, in which a second sample should be drawn 10 to 14 days after the first sample collection. Paired serum samples should be tested together to maximize the diagnostic value of test results.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific spike (S) and TGEV/PRCV-specific nucleocapsid (N) genes were targeted and amplified by dually labeled probe-based rRT-PCR. In brief, sample RNA was extracted and eluted using the Ambion MagMAX viral RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) and a KingFisher 96 magnetic particle processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the procedures provided by the manufacturers. The TGEV S gene and the TGEV/PRCV N gene-based rRT-PCR were modified from previous procedures (40) and performed routinely at the ISU-VDL using the TaqMan Fast 1-step mastermix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RT-PCRs were conducted on an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Life Technologies) as follows: 50\u00b0C for 5 min, 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 95\u00b0C for 3 s (40 cycles), and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. The rRT-PCR results were analyzed using an automatic baseline, with a threshold value of 0.1. A quantification cycle (CT) value of <35 was considered positive for both S and N gene-based rRT-PCR. Samples were considered positive for TGEV when both S and N genes were rRT-PCR positive. For PRCV, samples were considered positive when the S gene rRT-PCR was negative and the N gene rRT-PCR was positive. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus and PRCV CT data were reported as \u201cadjusted CT,\u201d calculated as shown in the following equation:\nAdjusted CT=(cutoff CT value\u2212sample CT value)",

            "text": "Serum samples were tested for TGEV- and PRCV-specific antibodies using the following three commercially available TGEV/PRCV differential blocking ELISA kits: (i) Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant (Biovet, Canada), (ii) INgezim Corona Diferencial (Ingenasa, Spain), and (iii) Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab (Svanova, Sweden). All assays were performed according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The pig serum samples and controls were first added to the TGEV antigen-coated wells for the first incubation step. In the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA, plate wells are coated with a recombinant TGEV S protein which is captured by a specific monoclonal antibody (MAb). The Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA is also based on a recombinant TGEV S protein but directly coated on plate wells, while the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA uses noninfectious TGEV antigen (source unknown) as a coating antigen. If anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are present in the test sample, they will bind to the viral (TGEV) antigen in the wells and block the antigenic sites. In contrast, if anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are absent in the test sample, these sites will remain free. Then, after a washing step to eliminate unbound antibodies, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse anti-TGEV MAb targeting the N-terminal region of the S glycoprotein that is deleted in PRCV, or an anti-TGEV/PRCV MAb that binds to conserved regions of both TGEV and PRCV, is added into the first well (odd column) or second well (even column), respectively, and attaches to specific free sites of the virus. Thus, when antibodies in the test sample occupy the binding sites on the antigen, the binding of the conjugated MAbs is blocked. If anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are absent in the test sample, these sites will remain free. The amount of antibody in the test sample that is bound to the TGEV antigen is inversely proportional to the intensity of the color. Antibody ELISA results were expressed as the percentage of inhibition (Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV and Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab) or optical density (INgezim Corona Diferencial) and interpreted (positive, negative, or suspect/inconclusive) for TGEV and PRCV according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, and analytical specificity of the three commercial ELISAs were calculated based on the true status of the samples compared to the specific detection of TGEV (Miller and/or Purdue) and/or PRCV antibodies. Specifically, porcine coronavirus-negative serum samples (n = 204) were used to estimate diagnostic specificity for the three ELISA kits. Serum samples positive for TGEV (Purdue and Miller strains) (n = 144) collected between 14 and 42 dpi and PRCV-positive samples (n = 72) collected between 14 and 42 dpi were used to calculate the time of detection, antibody detection over time, and the overall diagnostic sensitivity of the three ELISA kits for TGEV and PRCV Ab detection, respectively.",

The percentage of results for TGEV/PRCV ELISA were interpreted (positive, negative, or suspect) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The percentage of seropositive animals per day postinoculation detected by each kit were analyzed in two ways, by considering suspect results to be positive or by considering suspect results to be negative. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in ELISA-positive rates relative to TGEV (Purdue or Miller strains) and PRCV were calculated using Pearson\u2019s chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the three commercial ELISAs were evaluated based on experimental serum samples of precisely known porcine coronavirus immune status (i.e., samples collected on <7 dpi were negative, and serum samples collected on >7 dpi were positive). Analytical specificity (bidirectional cross-reactivity) between TGEV versus PRCV was evaluated using samples (n = 288) collected between 7 and 42 dpi from animals inoculated with TGEV strain Purdue (n = 96), TGEV strain Miller (n = 96), and PRCV (n = 96) in each given case.
