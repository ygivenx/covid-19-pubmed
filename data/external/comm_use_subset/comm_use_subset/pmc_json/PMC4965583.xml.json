            "text": "One hundred years after the \u201cmagic bullet\u201d proposal by Paul Ehrlich and decades after the establishment of hybridoma technology for producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by K\u00f6hler (1) and others (2, 3), antibodies have finally become very attractive therapeutic modalities. The high potency of antibodies and the ability to generate a seemingly unlimited diversity of specificities have led to antibody-based therapies that target many different illnesses and diseases (4\u20136). The majority of therapeutic antibodies currently available on the market are of mouse origin. Despite the proven success of animal immunizations for over 3 decades, the generation of mAbs for therapeutic purposes is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that requires months of work from the initial immunization to the identification of specific hybridoma antibodies. Although other approaches, such as phage display (7) and human memory B-cell immortalization and cloning (8), have been developed for the derivation of fully human mAbs that do not require animal immunization, these methods have shown limited success due to the challenges associated with antibodies of non-immune origins (9). To date, the production of mAbs from immunized rodents remains the most highly used platform for generating high quality therapeutic biologics, because of the natural in vivo recombination and affinity maturation of antibodies that occur during the humoral immune response in immunized animals (10\u201312).",

            "text": "Generating an effective immune response is not only fundamental for therapeutic antibody discovery, but is also crucial for vaccine development in combating infectious disease. Both begin with the host immune response elicited against the foreign antigen/vaccine after immunization. While animal immunization for therapeutic antibody generation requires a mechanism-driven strategy for obtaining antibodies that can demonstrate the therapeutic mode of action prior to hybridoma fusion and/or B-cell recovery efforts, vaccine development emphasizes the stimulation of protective immune responses by the host's immune system that are of sufficient strength and quality to sustain efficient and long term protection (13, 14). The development of an optimal immune response to meet either goal is challenging due to the sophisticated mechanisms that control immune responses (15). The process often involves multiple critical considerations, such as the selection of candidate antigens, choice of adjuvant, antigen/vaccine design, dosage, frequency of application, duration of immunization, injection protocols, etc. (16\u201318). Immune responses are typically monitored by measuring antibody titers (the relative concentration of antigen-specific antibodies) in the blood samples collected from the immunized hosts over the course of immunization. While many commercial kits and automated systems are available, ELISA remains the most widely used method for antibody titer measurements due to its simplicity and low cost. However, these conventional assays can only partially evaluate immune responses (19, 20), as they cannot accurately reveal data about the binding affinity, specificity, and epitope diversity of polyclonal antibodies, all of which are important for an effective immunization campaign that will lead to the generation of high quality antibody responses with distinct specificities.",

We propose that a workflow integrating these sensitive methods into the antibody generation platform can help \u201cengineer\u201d the immune response by providing information on the effectiveness of various immunization methods and by selecting the most appropriate animals for antibody recovery. Access to this information increases the probability of success in recovering antibodies that meet affinity and/or epitope requirements. In this report, we describe the following: the method development and establishment of the detection limits of our techniques, a proof-of-concept study using sera from IL-13 immunized mice, the creation of a workflow named Quality of Antibody Response (QAR), and finally the implementation of this workflow for a therapeutic anti-B-cell activating factor (BAFF) antibody generation campaign to guide the selection of optimal animal donors for hybridoma generation. We demonstrate how these sensitive methods can effectively differentiate the antibody responses among various animals, thereby contributing to the successful recovery of functional antibodies. Beyond its use in therapeutic antibody discovery, this QAR workflow can also be applied to advance vaccine development toward the goal of developing robust vaccines.",

To ensure that the purification process achieved maximal IgG recovery and optimal IgG quality, SDS-PAGE and AUC were used. We used naive serum to investigate the number of elution cycles required for full retrieval of the bound IgGs; SDS-PAGE was used to track the presence of IgGs in the samples from each of 10 consecutive elution steps. We found that IgGs could no longer be detected beyond the 5th elution cycle, suggesting that four elution steps were sufficient (data not shown). Thus, we used four elution steps throughout this study. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the material from each of the purification steps showed that the ProPlus (protein A/G) resin effectively captured IgGs from the mouse sera (Fig. 1A). Although the remaining flow-through and washing step solutions contained multiple bands, the eluted solutions showed a single band whose size corresponded to the typical IgG molecular mass of \u223c150 kDa. This result was confirmed using reducing SDS-PAGE, which revealed the presence of two bands with molecular weights corresponding to those of the heavy and light chains. The IgG bands from the four sequential elution cycles gradually decreased in signal intensity as expected. The pooled eluate, whose total collected volume was \u223c2 ml, was concentrated, and its purity and homogeneity were evaluated using AUC. Sedimentation velocity analysis showed that the sample contained 95% monomeric IgGs (Fig. 1B).",

Because of the high concentration of endogenous IgGs, the serum samples were diluted 1000-fold prior to protein A/G capture. The total IgGs, which included both endogenous IgGs and DL11, were captured at a density of \u223c2000 RU. As expected, the binding response decreased with decreasing DL11 concentrations in the serum (Fig. 2). The affinity of DL11 was determined to be \u223c24 (\u00b18) pm, and saturation was achieved at 5 nm human IL-13. There was no difference in the maximal response level when 10 and 100 nm human IL-13 solutions were injected over identical IgG-containing surfaces (data not shown). The concentration limit at which antigen-specific IgGs were detected in serum was determined to be 250 ng/\u03bcl, as signals <10 RU are considered to be background noise in this system. Using Equations 1 and 2, described under \u201cExperimental Procedures,\u201d the percentage of DL11 antigen-specific IgGs among the total IgGs was calculated for each reconstituted sample. As shown in Table 2, the lower limit of 250 ng/\u03bcl corresponded to a concentration that was equivalent to \u223c10% of the total IgGs being human IL-13-specific DL11.",

Of the other five samples that showed binding, the apparent affinities ranged from single/double digit picomolars to single digit nanomolars, as shown by the SPR binding data.

As shown in Fig. 6, the IgGs from serum H (panel C) protected the region encompassing residues 95\u2013110 from deuterium exchange, indicating that this serum sample contained IgGs that were specific to this region. Similarly, the IgGs from serum I (Fig. 6, panel D) also showed protection on the same region as that of serum H, with a relatively less extensive mass shift that was likely due to weaker affinity to human IL-13. In contrast, the IgGs from serum C (Fig. 6, panel B) showed no protection at this region, as the exchange observed there was equivalent to that of the control, containing no IgGs (panel A), suggesting that either this serum sample contained no IgGs targeting this region or that the level of IgGs present was below the detection limit of the method (31 ng/\u03bcl). The results obtained using both SPR and HDX LC/MS were consistent, in that the non-binders showed no binding of any region in human IL-13. For those samples that exhibited epitope protection, a diverse range of epitopes were identified. As depicted in Fig. 7, antibody responses directed toward various helix and loop regions of the human IL-13 protein were detected. Of the 112 amino acids in human IL-13, 63 were shown to be protected, indicating that 56% of the sequence elicited antibody responses.

The flowchart shown in Fig. 8 indicates the time frames of the QAR workflow components. Approximately 2 weeks after the immunization of animals with antigen or antigen/adjuvant mixtures, after the induction of an effective antibody response, serum samples are evaluated by ELISA to determine the presence and titer of antibodies. If the titer results are positive, the serum samples are directly analyzed by SPR to determine their apparent binding affinities and to quantify the percentage of antigen-specific IgGs. At the same time, the remaining volume of the serum samples (\u223c99 \u03bcl) is subjected to IgG purification using the PhyNexus automated purification system. While the SPR method can measure six serum samples at a time (six parallel sample injections based on the 6 \u00d7 6 multiplex configuration) with a protocol that typically includes multiple binding cycles, the PhyNexus MEA system can purify 12 samples at a time with an estimated run time of 2.5 h. Multiple MEA systems can be used in parallel to analyze more than 12 samples simultaneously. Taking into account the post-purification sample preparation time (enrichment and buffer-exchange steps), purified IgG samples can be ready for epitope mapping within 4 h. Meanwhile, analysis of the SPR data can provide early information on the affinity and quantity of the antibodies. After sample and reagent preparation, the HDX LC/MS experiment is performed overnight using an automated protocol that accurately controls both the deuterium exchange and quenching reaction times for each sample. Deuterium exchange, involving the sequential analysis of three time points, is performed and completed by the next day. Because of the large amount of data collected, the MS data analysis requires about a half-day of data processing using two in-house-derived proprietary software applications. Thus, a comprehensive data package can be generated within 2 days that provides useful feedback for guiding the immunization approach. The workflow can be applied at any point during the immunization campaign to track the development of antibody responses.",

Similar to the anti-IL-13 sera analysis, the anti-BAFF sera analysis (Table 4) revealed differences in antibody quality among the 12 serum samples. In addition to analyzing antibody binding to the human antigen that was used for immunization, we also analyzed antibody binding to the cynomolgus (cyno) monkey protein using SPR. Even though the human and cyno-BAFF proteins share 97% sequence identity, serum samples from mice P5804-01 and P5804-02 exhibited KD values for cyno-BAFF that were five times those for human BAFF, indicative of weaker interactions. We analyzed the binding epitopes of the various antibodies, focusing on the antibody responses to the regions in human BAFF that are known to be important for receptor interactions. Our in-house analysis indicated that regions encompassing residues 17\u201331, 68\u201390, 128\u2013137, and 137\u2013145 are important for function (data not shown). Therefore, we focused our attention on IgGs that were found to target these regions. Among the 12 serum samples, only five (P5801-01, P5801-02, P5811-01, P5821-01, and P5821-02) showed binding responses toward at least one of the prioritized epitope regions. Although four of these samples exhibited similar double digit picomolar or better affinities and less than \u223c2-fold shifts in binding to cyno-BAFF, the serum sample from mouse P5801-02 contained the highest amounts (>30%) of human BAFF and cyno-BAFF-specific IgGs. This mouse was subsequently selected for hybridoma fusion, and analysis of the subcloned monoclonal antibodies (Table 5) revealed that they exhibited low picomolar EC50 binding to human BAFF. In addition, blockade of receptor binding was confirmed, indicating that the selection of mice based on the epitope mapping of serum IgGs is an effective strategy.",

The profiling of immune responses using the standard ELISA method to measure the effectiveness of immunization and vaccination has been widely applied and reported (21\u201324). Here we used SPR instead, because it has several advantages over the traditional ELISA method. SPR is a label-free technique that can be performed in real time, but most importantly, it can provide highly precise measurements for determining association and dissociation rate constants (25\u201327), which cannot be achieved by ELISA. The application of SPR for analyzing complex biological samples has been demonstrated in several reports (28\u201330), although its use for these applications is still rare compared with other immunoassays. Another advantage of using SPR for both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of IgGs in serum is the ease of including a \u201cpurification\u201d step in which IgGs are captured by protein A/G onto the sensor surface. Protein A/G has affinity for mouse IgG isotypes 1, 2a, 2b, and 3. Therefore, the use of this reagent ensures that the antigen affinities of all the antibodies in the mouse serum will be effectively evaluated and that the resulting binding signal is highly specific for the IgGs. Furthermore, the amount of antigen-specific IgGs present in the serum can be quantified through calculations from the Rmax values. According to our results using reconstituted samples, the detection limit for high affinity, low picomolar binding antibodies in serum using SPR was \u223c250 ng/\u03bcl.",

Traditionally, the antigen-antibody contact surfaces have been determined by methods such as high resolution x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis (33, 34). However, these methods are not applicable for our purpose, because our samples contain antibody mixtures. In addition, the amount of material available for analysis and the time frame for acquiring epitope information are both limited. In search of a suitable technique, we initially explored peptide microarray (35, 36), in which a library of linear synthetic peptides is used to screen for IgG-binding epitopes. Samples containing mAbs with known binding epitopes, as well as sera from both naive animals and animals immunized with human IL-13, were tested using these methods. However, we were unable to identify specific epitopes for either the mAb or the antibodies present in the anti-IL-13 sera (data not shown). Regardless, these findings provided two important insights. First, we learned that the binding epitopes of the control mAbs were conformational, rather than linear, and second, we learned that the presence of serum proteins probably interfered with the methods. Therefore, we considered alternative techniques that could facilitate the identification of native protein conformational epitopes in solution with high resolution.",

The combination of hydrogen deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry has proven to be increasingly powerful for characterizing protein conformations, structural dynamics, and protein-protein interactions (37). Even though HDX is an established method and had successfully been applied in-house to map epitopes of purified mAbs at high concentrations, several challenges exist for the evaluation of IgGs in serum. Therefore, additional method development was required to improve the feasibility of this approach. One major challenge is the matrix effects from serum, which could produce significant interference if injected directly into the instrument. To address this issue, we developed a small scale affinity purification protocol using the PhyNexus system to purify IgGs from the serum using protein A/G columns. This platform was selected because of the availability of system automation and its relatively high throughput, enabling the purification of 12 serum samples simultaneously. The purification scheme was optimized to achieve maximal IgG recovery and purity, and our results showed that highly pure IgGs could be obtained from serum samples. The second challenge involved the sensitivity of the method for detecting antibody epitopes from a mixture of IgGs, each of which is present at a different concentration. To improve the sensitivity, several modifications were made in the sample preparation, including the use of concentrators to increase the IgG concentration and pH adjustment via buffer exchange to further optimize the deuterium exchange efficiency. With the incorporation of these additional sample-processing steps, it was important to determine that the IgGs were recovered at sufficient concentrations for signal detection. An experiment in which a high affinity mAb with known binding epitopes was evaluated at different concentrations showed that the sensitivity of the method was \u223c31 ng of antigen-specific IgG per \u03bcl of serum. This high sensitivity can facilitate the detection of less abundant IgGs exhibiting unique epitopes, maximizing the diversity of antibodies that can be recovered.",

As anticipated, the results of these analyses allowed us to differentiate the antibody responses among the immunized mice with respect to apparent antigen affinity, amount of antigen-specific activity, and epitope diversity. To inhibit IL-13 function, the development of high affinity anti-IL-13 antibodies that target different epitopes of the IL-13 protein, resulting in either the disruption of IL-13 and IL-13 receptor binding or the disruption of IL-13 and IL-4 \u03b1-receptor binding, is required (38). Our analysis of the nine different anti-IL-13 mouse sera revealed important binding affinity and epitope information that allowed us to differentiate the quality of the antibody responses. Although five of the serum samples were found to contain antibodies that bound to the surface of IL-13 that interacts with the IL-13 receptor (epitope 101\u2013110), two sera (D and G) contained additional antibodies that bound to the surface of IL-13 that interacts with the IL-4 \u03b1-receptor (epitopes 67\u201369 (D) and epitopes 51\u201358 and 66\u201379 (G)). To maximize the recovery of functional antibodies, serum G therefore would be the best choice for subsequent antibody generation, as it contained high affinity antibodies that could target both mechanisms of action. Although hybridoma fusions were not performed to assess the recovery of functional monoclonal antibodies targeting human IL-13, they were performed to track and assess the antibodies generated for the BAFF program (see below).",

As reflected by our selected methods, throughput was an essential consideration. According to our assessment, the complete data package can be compiled within 2 business days, due in large part to the automation of our platform methods (multiplex SPR array, tip column-based walk away serum purification, and liquid-handling HDX reaction control), minimizing the need for extensive manual work. Furthermore, with the implementation of in-house MS software programs for automating the HDX data analysis (beyond the scope of this paper), the entire workflow process can be efficiently executed and can support additional iterations if necessary. As shown in Tables 4 and 5, we used the QAR workflow to guide the development of therapeutic anti-BAFF antibodies, and we demonstrated that the data package contributed to the successful retrieval of functional anti-BAFF antibodies in a timely manner. We focused on the identification of immunized animals that produced high affinity antibodies that targeted well defined epitopes for use in hybridoma fusions. The comprehensive data package generated again confirmed that our methods can provide clear differentiation among the antibody responses in various animals. The finding that our methods consistently provided in-depth and timely information for directing the development of high quality antibodies suggests that they will have widespread utility in guiding therapeutic antibody production in the future.",

The combination of SPR and HDX LC/MS enables the comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of antibodies present in serum samples. While SPR analysis provides antibody affinity information and antigen-specific antibody quantification, MS analysis provides information about the structural interactions between serum antibodies and their antigens. Thus, these are complementary methods that reveal unique information that cannot be obtained using conventional methods. The proposed workflow process can also be executed at a speed that the biopharmaceutical industry demands to discover novel epitopes for new therapeutic modes of action. In addition, the QAR workflow can be useful in guiding the development of robust vaccines. The described methods can be used to monitor the development of novel immunogens, vaccine preparations, or delivery systems, at the early stages of development, to help predict their efficacy and safety. To our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates how the described methods can be implemented to produce in-depth information that distinguishes antibody responses and guides the production of therapeutic antibodies. We intend to follow up with additional studies to demonstrate the utility of this workflow in future therapeutic antibody and vaccine discovery programs.",
