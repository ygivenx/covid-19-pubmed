            "text": "Malaria still remains one of the most devastating and deadly infectious disease, which is characterized by the intermittent high fevers and it\u2019s another form namely cerebral malaria, leads to the neurological complications such as brain injury and coma1,2. As per the World Health Organization (WHO) latest estimate, almost 212 million cases of malaria along with 42,900 deaths were reported in December 2016 among 91 countries, worldwide3. The high risk of developing malarial infection among a population group depends upon the several factors including the presence of children under the age of 5 years4, a patient with HIV co-infection4, pregnant woman4, mobile population4,5, and travelers6. The causal organism of malaria is a protozoan parasite belongs to the genus Plasmodium and it spreads by the bite of hitherto infected female Anopheles mosquito7. There are mainly four species of Plasmodium namely P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. vivax that are responsible for the disastrous diseased condition among human being. Recently, P. knowlesi was considered as the fifth species with the ability to cause human malaria infection in Southeast Asian countries mainly Malaysia8. If we talk about the severity of infection and distribution of disease, P. falciparum is the most severe form of a parasite than other leads to most of the deaths whereas P. vivax is the most widely distributed human parasite outside the sub-Saharan region of Africa and cause huge morbidity. The life cycle of malaria parasite consisting of four stages namely liver stage, blood stage, and transmission stage in human being while the last one is mosquito stage and keeping in mind the end goal to destroy the ailment, each stage ought to be considered for treatment9. Artemisinin combination therapy is the first-line treatment for P. falciparum infection in the region where chloroquine resistance has been evolved. Along with the fast onset of action, artemisinin and its derivatives have rapid clearance from the human body, which needs the combination of the slow-clearing drug to increase the drug efficacy and kills the remaining parasites. The most widely used combination therapies are Artemether-lumefantrine (commercial name: Coartem) and amodiaquine-artesunate (commercial name: Coarsucam)10. While the recently approved combination therapies are artesunate-pyronaridine (commercial name: Pyramax) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Euartesim)10. The recent emerging resistance against artemisinin urges to develop some new strategy to prevent the malaria diseases condition11. Therefore, in this study, we applied a novel immunoinformatics approach to design multi-epitope based subunit vaccine that may prevent the disease by maintaining the host hemostasis by the inhibition of anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory proteins present in mosquito saliva. It will also inhibit the entry of parasite within the host body by a similar mechanism. Apart from this, if any way parasite enters into the host body, vaccine candidate will stop the salivary protein-mediated induction of parasitic growth.",

            "text": "Among different anopheline vectors, Anopheles stephensi is a sub-tropical species that most abundantly present in the Indian subcontinent and also distributed across the Middle East and South Asia region12. A. stephensi transmit the malarial infection by injecting various Plasmodium species to the human host typically via bites. Salivary gland of mosquitos implement various functions for the survival of the vector and complement their feeding behavior by producing a large array of a biochemically active molecule that has immunomodulatory, anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory properties that disable the host hemostatic response for successful blood feeding13,14. Salivary proteins are antigenic and immunogenic in nature which helps the infectivity of parasite14,15. D7 protein and salivary apyrase are two different salivary proteins that help in binding, and inhibition of the platelets aggregation, respectively. Salivary peroxidase helps in heme binding and peroxidase activity while Putative TIL domain polypeptide functions as trypsin inhibitor16. Recently, it was reported that hamadarin is a 16 kDa protein present in Anopheles stephensi saliva which inhibits the activation of plasma contact system17 and ultimately blood coagulation. Another protein from Anopheles gambie saliva namely gSG6 plays essential blood feeding18,19. Recently, Vijay S. et al. reported that salivary proteins might be utilized to develop novel antimalarial control strategies via innate immune protection against malaria16. These proteins could likewise evoke a host IgG response in natural conditions20,21. Mosquito salivary gland surface (SGS) proteins are the prevalent immunogenic component present in saliva having ability to induce immunogenic responses22.",

Allergenicity, antigenicity and physiochemical properties were also obtained for the vaccine protein. Moreover, tertiary structure prediction followed by refinement was performed to get a refined 3D model having a higher number of residues in the favored region of Ramachandran plot. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation of vaccine constructs with TLR4 were also performed to check the binding energy and complex stability. Finally, disulfide engineering and in silico cloning was performed to increase the stability of vaccine construct and ensuring its effective expression in the microbial system, respectively. This study finally represents a novel approach to develop malaria vaccine using salivary protein instead of parasitic protein, which could be helpful to prevent the Plasmodium infection to human host.",

Therefore, it\u2019s the need of time to search for the new options to tackle this severe problem. The vector for malaria is the Anopheles stephensi in the Indian subcontinent leads to the transfer of malaria parasite. Literature survey reveals that salivary proteins of Anopheles mosquito not only supports the pathogenesis but are also immunogenic in nature. Therefore, this study was designed to reach a step ahead in the path of vaccine development. We used the primary amino acid sequence of Anopheles mosquito salivary protein to design a subunit vaccine construct. The constructed vaccine has CTL, HTL and BCL epitopes of varying length. It has antigenic properties in the absence of allergenic properties. It was stable and having a good binding affinity for the TLR-4 receptor. Collectively, this study applied a series of immunoinformatics tools in a sequential manner to find an effective vaccine that may fight against the malaria infection. However, this study needs experimental validation to prove this computational work. The experimental work may include the synthesis of designed subunit vaccine followed by the in vitro and in vivo analysis to determine the immunogenicity and safety concern of the same.",

Therefore, IEDB MHC-II epitope prediction module was used to predict the HTL epitopes for all 14 Anopheles salivary protein sequences44. The available parameters were kept default except for allele selection where the nominated alleles were H2-IAb, H2-IAd, and H2-IEd.

In other words subunit vaccine must contain both CTL and HTL epitopes along with suitable linkers. Keeping in mind the end goal to effectively activate both innate and adaptive immune response, subunit vaccine must consist of a strong immunostimulatory adjuvant. In the previous decades, there is a huge headway in the adjuvant engineering, for instance, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have made its contribution as a part of peptide-based subunit vaccine as a functional option for present-day immunotherapy45. Recently, Junqueira et al. have shown that CpGs oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and Glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPL) gotten from Trypanosome cruzi having the ability to activate TLR-4 and TLR9 leads to actuate potent pro-inflammatory reaction46. Secondly, proteo-glycolipid complex (P8GLC) derived from Leishmania parasite has shown its affinity for the TLR-4 receptor and recognized as ligand47. Moreover, TLRs having the capability to recognize the Plasmodium ligands, for example, Plasmodium falciparum primes the human TLR-4 response towards high proinflammatory cytokine profile48. Shanmugam A. et at. has reported that synthetic TLR-4 agonist namely RS-09 (Sequence: APPHALS) can be used as a novel class of adjuvant49, therefore, it was added as an adjuvant and linked with epitopes (CTL and HTL) by using EAAAK linker50. Linkers assume an imperative part in simulating the vaccine construct to work as an independent immunogen and producing higher antibody titer than that of single immunogen51. Total three linkers namely EAAAK, AAY, and GPGPG, were used to construct the final vaccine. AAY and GPGPG linkers were added at the intra-epitope position to link the CTL and HTL epitopes, respectively.",
