Second, there is a unique RNA replication mechanism using the TRS motif that is known as the \u201ccopy choice\u201d mechanism, which induces homologous RNA recombination in CoVs [3], [6]. Third, CoV possesses the largest genome (26\u201332 kb) among RNA viruses. Furthermore, heterologous recombination that Betacoronavirus subgroup A has the hemagglutinin esterase gene originated from influenza C virus [7], [8]. These mutation and/or recombination events change viral properties, host range and pathogenicity.",

FCoV is distributed worldwide in cats and mainly induces mild intestinal inflammation in kittens [9]. FCoV inducing enteric disease is known as feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). On the other hand, cats infected with FCoV rarely develop the more severe disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is caused by a mutant virus that is referred to as FIP virus (FIPV). In addition, FCoVs can be divided into two serotypes, types I and II, based on antigenicity [10]\u2013[12]. These serotypes differ primarily in growth characteristics in cell culture and in receptor usage. Type II FCoV is able to use feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as its receptor, but type I FCoV cannot [9], [13]. Recently, it was revealed that the S protein was solely responsible for the differences in types I and II FCoV with regard to growth characteristics in cell culture and fAPN usage [14].",

CCoV is widespread in the dog population and is one of the most important canine enteropathogens [16]\u2013[22]. CCoVs were also divided into two genotypes; I and II. Before 2000, it was thought that CCoV had only one genotype, but strain Elmo/02 with a type I FCoV-like S gene was detected in Italy [23]. The Elmo/02 strain possessed a novel ORF3 gene that was absent from other Alphacoronavirus 1 between the S and ORF3a genes [24]. Finally, this type I FCoV like-CCoV was designated type I CCoV and the reference CCoV was designated type II CCoV. Surprisingly, 36.9%\u201376.8% of dogs with diarrhea were co-infected with both types I and II CCoV [25]\u2013[27]. Furthermore, type II CCoV was divided into two subtypes, IIa and IIb [28]. In type IIb CCoV, the 5\u2032-terminal region of the S gene was similar to that of TGEV and it was thought that type IIb CCoV emerged via recombination between type IIa CCoV and TGEV [28]. Recently, a type IIa CCoV strain CB/05 with high virulence was reported in Europe [29]. CB/05-infected pups showed clinical signs such as lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea and acute lymphopenia, and the viral genome was observed in extraintestinal tissues including brain [29], [30]. Furthermore, immune response induced by enteric CCoV did not protect dogs from infection with CB/05 [31]. However, there is little genetic information on CCoV in Japan.",

            "text": "Type I FCoV strains C3663 and Yayoi, type II FCoV strains M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627 and type II CCoV strains fc1, fc4, fc7, fc9, fc76, fc100, fc94-039, fc97-022, fc00-089 and fc00-016 were analyzed in this study (Table 1). Type I and II FCoVs, excluding Tokyo/cat/130627, were characterized by indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that were kindly provided by Dr. Hohdatsu [11], [33]. Yayoi strain was isolated from a cat with a non-effusive form of FIP in Tokyo by serial passage in suckling mouse brain, and was then adapted to fcwf-4 cells [34]. C3663 strain was isolated from a cat with an effusive form of FIP in Kagoshima in 1994 [35]. The pathogenicity of C3663 and Yayoi in cats was characterized [36]. M91-267 strain was isolated from a cat with an effusive form of FIP in Miyazaki in 1991 [35]. Three SPF cats were experimentally infected with M91-267, and all of these died from FIP (unpublished data). KUK-H strain was isolated from a cat with an effusive form of FIP in Kagoshima in 1987, and KUK-H/L that formed large plaques was plaque-purified from the KUK-H strain [35]. KUK-H/L caused lethal FIP in cats [35]. RNA sequences of Tokyo/cat/130627 were obtained from FIP ascites in a cat in Tokyo in 2013. The FIPV spread quickly in a cattery, and more than twenty cats developed FIP. Type II CCoV strains, fc1, fc4, fc7, fc9, fc76, fc100, fc94-039 and fc97-022, were isolated between 1990 and 1997 in Japan [19], and fc00-016 and fc00-087 were isolated in 2000 in Japan [37].",

Deduced amino acid sequences for ORFs S, 3a, 3b, 3c, E, M, N, 7a and 7b in type II FCoVs were compared with those of type I FCoV C3663 and type II CCoV fc1 (Table S2, S3). Both M91-267 and KUK-H/L showed low identities with type I FCoV C3663 in ORFs S, 3a, 3b, 3c and E and high identities in ORFs N, 7a and 7b (Table S2). In contrast, the two strains showed high identities with type II CCoV fc1 in ORFs S, 3a, 3b, 3c and E and low identities in ORFs N, 7a and 7b (Table S3). In ORF M, the identities among type I FCoV, type II FCoV and CCoV were neither high nor low (Table S2, S3). Interestingly, comparison between Tokyo/cat/130627 and type I FCoV showed low identities in ORF S and high identities in ORFs 3a, 3c, E, M, N, 7a and 7b, while comparison with type II CCoV fc1 showed high identity only in ORF S and low identities in ORF 3a, 3c, E, M, N, 7a and 7b (Table S2, S3).",

An intact 3c gene is apparently essential for efficient replication of FCoV in the intestinal tract, resulting in the secretion of FCoV from feces and transmission of FCoV among cat population [55], [56]. On the other hand, many FIPV possessed truncated 3c gene and cats with FIP did not excrete virus in feces [57]\u2013[59]. Furthermore, one outbreak of type II FIPV with intact ORF 3c gene occurred in Taiwan. In early stages of the outbreak, the type II FIPV possessed intact 3c gene, but lost it in later stages [60]. Therefore, these type II FCoVs with truncated 3c gene, M91-267 and Tokyo/cat/130627, might not spread well among cats.",

These regions may be essential for growth of FCoV in cats and double recombination may be required to maintain both the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-termini of FCoV. Type II FCoVs possessed two types of RdRp element derived from type I FCoV or type II CCoV (Fig. 2A), suggesting both types of RdRp were able to function during replication and transcription in cat body. Furthermore, the region upstream of RdRp might be essential for FCoV infection in cats. In addition, it has been reported that N protein is important for viral particle production [52], and the N gene is conserved among FCoVs. Therefore, the N protein of FCoV, but not CCoV, may be essential for replication of FCoV in cats. Interestingly, simplot analysis showed four other candidate recombination sites, one in the 3c gene, two in the N gene and one in the 7a gene, which showed high identity between CCoV and type I FCoV (Fig. 3). If the M or N genes of type I FCoV are not necessary for growth of FCoV in cats, other recombinant type II FCoVs using these possible recombination sites must occur. Further analysis of type II FCoV is necessary to clarify the recombination events of CoV in cats.",

We also reported one-third of the full genome of three type II FCoV strains (M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627) and one type II CCoV fc1. Six of seven type II FCoV strains emerged by recombination events at the E or M gene. However, the recombination event of Tokyo/cat/130627 occurred at the 3\u2032-terminal of the S gene. The nucleotide sequences indicated that M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627 originated from type I FCoV strains similar to C3663, Yayoi and NTU2/R/2003, respectively, and that the central region, including the S gene, was acquired from type II CCoV strains similar to fc94-039, fc1 and fc00-089, respectively. In addition, the recombination sites were clearly different (Fig.3 and 4A, B). These results indicate that the recombination events between type I FCoV and type II CCoV occurred independently. In addition, original viruses of foreign type II FCoVs, 79-1146, 79-1683 and NTU156/P/2007 differed from those of these three Japanese type II FCoVs, indicating that the recombination events occurred among cat populations all over the world.",

In addition, many sera from type II FCoV-infected cats in the outbreak could cross-neutralize type I FCoV infection, and those from type I FCoV-infected cats in the field could not cross-neutralize type II FCoV infection (our unpublished data).
