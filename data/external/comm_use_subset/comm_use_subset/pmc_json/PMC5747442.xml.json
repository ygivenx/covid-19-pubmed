In low-resource settings, limited access to clinical laboratory diagnostics requires empiric case management of febrile illness. The use of comprehensive fever syndromic surveillance, with enhanced clinical microbiology, advanced diagnostics and more robust epidemiologic investigation, could enable healthcare providers to offer a differential diagnosis of fever syndrome and more appropriate care and treatment [6]. In order to inform clinical management and optimize treatment regimens for febrile patients, information on common causes and associations of febrile illness, particularly in areas endemic to malaria, is critically required.",

Pathogen-specific approaches have been utilized to evaluate illness due to certain febrile diseases, predominately malaria, typhoid fever and arboviral infections, such as dengue virus; however, disease burden estimates due to other fever associated organisms, such as Leptospira and Coxiella burnetii, remain in question [9\u201313]. Recent research evaluating the status of global fever surveillance has identified significant gaps in the field, including the lack of multi-pathogen diagnostic approaches, as well as limitations in geographic and temporal coverage to account for disease variations observed across time and space [7,14\u201315].",

While many of these agents are known to colonize in the human pharynx asymptomatically and thus not contribute to disease status, these organisms may have the capacity to launch an infectious course, especially in a host suffering from a weakened immune system and/or plagued by other concurrent infections. Previous studies have demonstrated that when influenza is identified, detection usually signifies etiology of clinical illness; thus, we are more confident in suggesting disease causality for the 101 (26%) individuals who presented with influenza A/B [24\u201326]. Among influenza cases, we detected influenza A in 91 (24%) patients, and detected influenza B in 11 (3%) patients. These results are similar to findings from a recent 30-month (2008\u20132010) nationwide sero-prevalence study of influenza in Tanzania, which found influenza A to be around eight times more prevalent than influenza B [27]; however, our results vary from analysis conducted the same year (2015\u20132016) in East Africa by the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Influenza Programme, which detected similar prevalence of influenza A (55%) and influenza B (45%) [28].",

A recent CDC TAC pilot study investigating the contribution of respiratory pathogens to hospitalizations of pneumonia in rural Western Kenya also utilized the respiratory TAC assay, among other diagnostic measures [29]. This research group found similar detection frequency of adenovirus (8%) and S. pneumoniae (60%); however, detected lower frequency of influenza A (8%) as compared to our study in Tanzania [29]. In another respiratory illness investigation by Jain et al. where TAC, PCR and serology were employed, researchers evaluated community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization among US children [30]. While testing algorithms varied somewhat from the measures employed by this study, results from the US-based study demonstrated similar prevalence of influenza A (7%) and Human Rhinovirus (27%); lower prevalence of S. aureus (1%) and S. pneumoniae (4%); and higher prevalence of RSV (28%) and M. pneumoniae (8%), as compared to the younger pediatric cohort enrolled in our Tanzania-based study [30]. The variation observed in detection frequency across these distinct settings as well as others, suggests perhaps different existing exposures and/or epidemiologic risk depending upon geography [29\u201332]. Further multi-country TAC studies, using a standardized approach, with rigorous case definitions and uniform enrollment criteria, would help facilitate pooled analyses for more generalizable results.",

Additionally, detection of Plasmodium in older children and adults is not unexpected, and positive detection is not necessarily indicative of fever etiology or resultant of new, active infection. To further examine quantification of Plasmodium detections across multiple diagnostic platforms, we conducted a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test comparing mean Ct values, as determined by qPCR, for patients grouped within each level of parasite intensity (1+, 2+, 3+, or 4+), as determined by blood smear. Findings from this analysis demonstrate an inverse relationship between mean Ct values and level of parasite intensity. Moreover, we conducted a linear multivariate regression analysis to determine fully adjusted mean Ct values associated with specific demographic and clinical variables. Outputs form this analysis show statistically significant lower mean Ct values for older children (20.8) as compared to younger children (27.8). Additionally, we observe lower mean Ct values for patients presenting with severe fever (21.1) and headache (21.5), as well as those patients who were admitted for in-patient care and treatment (22.4). As the clinical research community begins to shift away from traditional microscopy approaches and towards molecular diagnostics for the diagnosis of malaria, this type of analysis could be valuable for directing patient management and clinical decision-making based upon intensity of infection, as determined by quantitative Ct outputs [33].",

To this end, clinical and epidemiologic correlates of agents detected among at least 10% of our patient population were evaluated using an agent-specific filtered multivariate logistic regression approach to determine statistically significant factors. Results demonstrated several statistically significant factors to be considered, particularly age and symptomatic presentation. Age was found to be statistically associated with detection of H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, Human Rhinovirus, Influenza A, Enterovirus, and Plasmodium. Symptomatic presentation of at least one clinical indicator examined was found to be statistically associated with detection of Group A Streptococcus, P. aeruginosa, Influenza A and Plasmodium. From this analysis, we also observe that detection of Plasmodium was most prevalent among participants presenting with severe fever (38.7\u00b0C\u201440.5\u00b0C) across all age groups. These results are in agreement with findings from another recent fever study by D\u2019acremont et al which found malaria, along with pneumonia and typhoid, to be more common among patients presenting with severe illness as compared to those with mild illness in Tanzania [14].",

AFI-TAC analyzes whole blood specimens derived from venous blood, whereas respiratory TAC screens NP/OP swabs derived from a non-sterile pharyngeal source. While agents detected in whole blood indicate viremia, bacteremia, and/or parasitemia, agents detected from the pharynx may only be representative of microbial carriage. In this regard, for the purposes of this study, we did not state final determination of disease etiology. In order to keep consistent with our diagnostic definitions of positive detection, we only determined pathogen detection if quantitative PCR cycle thresholds (Ct) were at or below 37. On certain occasions, particularly in the case of S. Typhi, patients presented with Ct values within just one point of our a priori determined Ct cutoff value (i.e., 37.04; 37.23; 37.99). It could be argued that Ct cutoffs need to be re-adjusted for certain pathogens included on the AFI TAC assay, particularly bacterial pathogens that may present with low copy numbers in blood. While uniform approaches to Ct cutoffs of syndromic TAC cards may enable diagnostic efficiency and ease-of-use for laboratory technicians, it may not account for the natural variations in microbial load for the diverse suite of viral, bacterial and parasitic agents surveyed by this assay. A better understanding of the diagnostic value of quantitative diagnostics in determining febrile disease etiology, particularly in situations of co-detection, as well as the utility of re-calibrating diagnostic thresholds (Ct cutoffs) for molecular tests, is critically needed [14]. Finally, while enrollment spanned one full calendar year to account for seasonal variation, we also note a limitation with temporal coverage, given the possibility of yearly variation. We suggest that syndromic surveillance projects of this kind be extended for a minimum of 3\u20135 years, in order to ascertain true prevalence estimates.",

Quantitative diagnostics of this kind can not only expand the number of agents surveyed in our investigation, but can also assist in revealing the complexity of infectious disease diagnoses when multiple detections are observed. Previous studies suggest that co-infection of multiple microbial agents is likely to lead to pathogen interactions, which can have significant clinical ramifications [14]. The combination of multiple detections observed in this study underscores the difficulty in providing a simple diagnosis for febrile illness. However, as shown in the case of Plasmodium, Ct can add a useful quantitative metric for determining severity of infection and facilitate febrile patient processing, particularly in endemic settings when detection of parasitemia is not necessarily indicative of fever etiology. Given that the AFI TaqMan array card is optimized for AFI surveillance in the African region, it can serve as a rapid screen for outbreak investigation and/or for preliminary surveillance of circulating pathogens and is an appropriate diagnostic choice to fulfill the needs of our initial exploratory investigation. However, once baseline prevalence has been established, more target, pathogen-specific diagnostic approaches (such as RDTs) may be more cost-effective for directing public health surveillance and proper patient management.",
