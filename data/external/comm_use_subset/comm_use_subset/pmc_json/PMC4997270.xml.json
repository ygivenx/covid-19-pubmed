The use of animals as models in research frequently necessitates their euthanasia in order to collect samples and final data needed to support the studies. There is an ethical expectation that, if it has been determined that euthanasia is indicated, the method selected should be humane, taking into consideration the well-being of the animal that is being euthanized, in addition to the person who is performing the procedure [1]. Regulations in multiple countries require that the euthanasia of animals that are used in research be performed in a manner that minimizes pain and distress to the animal [2,3,4,5]. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Panel on Euthanasia and Canadian Council on Animal Care in Science have published Guidelines that take into account existing literature and make recommendations on factors to be considered when determining the appropriate method of euthanasia for a particular species and circumstance [1,4].

Indeed, it should be remembered that it is impossible to euthanize an animal using a chemical anesthetic agent (injected or inhaled) without first inducing anesthesia. Therefore, the current recommendations for the use of inhalant anesthetics should be considered when evaluating the use of inhalant gases for euthanasia. Tranquilli and Grimm provide an overview of the four stages of inhalant anesthesia. Stage I (the stage of voluntary movement) lasts from the initial administration of the inhalant anesthesia until the loss of the righting reflex. As they progress to Stage II, the animal becomes ataxic and loses its ability to stand. An animal in Stage II will exhibit involuntary movements and vocalizations, but it is no longer conscious. Stage III includes the level of anesthesia where surgery can be performed. In Stage IV, the animal has extreme central nervous system and cardiovascular depression and will die unless the anesthetic agent is removed and the animal is resuscitated [6]. When performing surgery, the veterinarian targets Stage III, while in euthanasia, they target Stage IV. As with the selection of an appropriate agent for euthanasia, the ideal anesthetic permits rapid induction, minimizing the potential pain and distress experienced by the animal as they progress through Stage I of anesthesia.

            "text": "Although the AVMA guidelines acknowledge that loss of consciousness (transition from stage I to stage II) will be more rapid if animals are initially exposed to a high concentration of an inhalant agent, they recommend gradual exposure because high concentrations of some gases, such as concentrations of CO2 at the levels of 40%\u201350%, can be aversive and distressing [1,7]. The AVMA Guidelines clearly state that high concentrations of CO2 are associated with pain, but suggest that the potential distress associated with exposure to low concentrations of CO2 over prolonged periods of time is not well characterized. Yet, the distressing effects of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of CO2 for rats are well documented [8]. Homeostatic regulation of blood CO2 concentrations is critical as CO2 alters blood pH by combining with water to form carbonic acid, and even a small change in blood pH can be fatal (for review, see [9,10]). Initial elevations of arterial CO2 (i.e., hypercapnia) lead to an increase in respiration rate and tidal volume to help \u201cblow off\u201d excess CO2 (see review [11]), but when arterial pH continues to decrease, a feeling of dyspnea and anxiety begin to emerge. This is followed by a feeling of fear and panic with moderate hypercapnia, and sedation and loss of consciousness during severe hypercapnia. For example, exposing humans to 5% CO2 increases respiration responses without increasing anxiety, while exposure to 7.5% CO2 increases anxiety symptoms (e.g., self-reports of fear and panic [12,13,14,15,16]). Exposure to 20% CO2 induces a strong sense of suffocation (dyspnea) that is accompanied by symptoms strongly associated with panic attacks (e.g., fear of dying, shortness of breath, cardiorespiratory response [17]). Anxiety symptoms, such as fear and panic can lead to aversion and avoidance (e.g., phobias), and although aversion/avoidance is not specific to anxiety-associated symptoms/emotions (e.g. aversion/avoidance can be related to food that can elicit disgust) [18]. In the presence of a life threatening event, panic can occur, but following the event fear and avoidance can occur. Fear is also associated with potential imminent threats [19]. ",

Similar to humans, exposing rats to mild hypercarbic gas (e.g., 7% to 7.5% CO2 [21]) increases respiration rate and tidal volume that reduces hypercapnia, but this concentration of CO2 does not alter aversion-associated exploratory behaviors in an open field test (unpublished observations). However, exposing rats to higher concentrations of hypercarbic gas (e.g., normoxic, 10% to 20% CO2) elicits additional components of a panic-associated response as evidenced by increases in sympathetic activity [22], blood pressure [20,23,24], anxiety-like behaviors as evidenced by increased aversion during risk versus reward conflict tests (i.e., Vogel test, open field exploration test, social interaction tests, and increases in panic/escape/flight-associated locomotor responses [20,23,25,26]), and mobilization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [27,28,29].",

Carbon dioxide readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to directly interact with neurons and inhibits the majority of neuronal networks causing a depression in activity which leads to loss of consciousness and anesthesia with rising concentrations. Yet, there are also specialized central chemoreceptive neurons [30,31] in medullary regions that are critical for regulating breathing following subtle changes in CO2/H+ [11] and in panic-generating brain regions, such as the hypothalamus [32]. In fact exposing healthy rats to normoxic 20% CO2 concentrations selectively increases cellular activity in panic and anxiety networks, such as the perifornical hypothalamus and dorsal periaqueductal gray [26]. When stimulated, these areas induce panic-associated symptoms in humans [33,34] and panic-associated behaviors and cardioexcitation in rats [35,36] and cats [37]. Others have proposed fear centers, such as the amygdala, as critical sites for CO2-induced panic in mice [38], but panic responses to 20% CO2 are intact in humans with bilateral loss of amygdala function [39].

Rats were placed in a clear custom-built Plexiglass\u00ae cylindrical plethysmograph chamber where they were capable of moving (i.d. 9.5 cm, length 26 cm, wall thickness 3 mm) with atmospheric air infused at a flow rate of 2.8 L/min using a Vetamac flowmeter (Rossville, IN, USA) until a steady baseline respiration rate was noted (approximately 30 min).

The recordings were scored offline by Cristian Bernabe for time duration of seizure (rapid and repeated contraction and relaxation of body muscles with uncontrolled shaking of the body), running (rapid movement within the cage), and gasping (sudden and sharp inhalation of air through the mouth) behaviors using ODLog\u2122 software (version 2.5 Macropod Software, Yarraville, Victoria, Australia). Additionally, the video recordings were used to approximate the time to loss of consciousness. In humans, loss of consciousness is associated with the inability to engage in verbal communication [1]. In animals, the loss of righting reflex is utilized [6]. This can correlate to the ataxia seen in stage I of anesthesia, but as involuntary movement can continue in stage II, where the animal is unconscious, care must be taken in evaluation of movement as an indicator of consciousness [6]. For this study, we determined that the rats had lost consciousness at the point when gross motor control was compromised. We had initially determined that the point when the rat let its nose touch the cage bottom would be the time for loss of consciousness, but this behavior was inconsistent in the groups. So, instead we considered the gross loss of motor function as the point where the rat either touched its nose to the ground or began staggering with significant ataxia. It is recognized that both of these measures are very subjective and may not be reflective of the actual state of consciousness of the animals. The video was recorded at baseline and from the initiation of the infusion of gas and was observed for 5 min or until the respiration ceased. ",

An ANOVA was utilized to analyze differences between groups for social interaction behaviors, and a two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze open field behaviors.

The pressor response began to return to normal post-CO2 infusion, but then increased again. This coincided with a dramatic increase in respiration rate in Figure 1d when we noted that the rats had increased respiration rates during CO2 infusion but then, at offset, were moving to the atmospheric air intake, where they began to breathe rapidly (gas \u00d7 time interaction F(19,361) = 24.5, p < 0.001, Figure 1d, n = 11,10, we lost signal on one rat in each group).

            "text": "In the first experiment, we first challenged healthy rats to a 5 min infusion of normoxic 20% CO2 to isolate behavioral and physiological responses to increased CO2 concentration. This method only increased ambient O2 concentrations by approximately 0.2%, but rapidly increased ambient CO2 concentrations from being undetectable to 20% to 24% during the infusions. Behavioral assessments revealed that rats experiencing the 20% CO2 challenge had increased panic and escape or flight associated locomotor responses (from 2 counts/min to 12 counts/min) during the CO2 challenge. This challenge also increased mean arterial blood pressure by 25 to 28 mmHg, and respiration rate by approximately 75 breath/min. At the offset of CO2 infusions and onset of atmospheric air infusions, we noted that the rats would orient themselves so that their nose was near the gas infusion intake which coincided with an even greater increase in respiration from 150 breaths/min to almost 275 breaths/min. Following the CO2 challenge, the rats expressed increased fear and avoidance-associated behavior (operantly defined as thigmotaxis and social avoidance, and evidenced by reduced time spent exploring center regions of an open field arena and reduced social interaction time). It is possible that CO2 induced drowsiness that might have contributed to a decrease in the exploratory behavior in these rats, but previous work with rats that were fully anesthetized with CO2 report that the rats regain locomotor control within 90 s and exhibit a complete clinical recovery from anesthesia within 5 min, but they exhibit antinociception for up to 60 min [42]. Environmental concentrations of CO2 that are less than 5% do not typically induce symptoms and signs of anxiety in people [12], though there is an increase in the respiratory activity to attempt to blow off excessive CO2 to return the plasma CO2/H+ to homeostasis (for review, see [9,10]). However, environmental concentrations of 7.5% CO2 begin to signal air hunger and are anxiety symptom/sign provoking in humans [12], and environmental concentrations of 20% CO2 induce symptoms such as suffocation sensations, fear of dying, and robust cardio-respiratory responses which are all strongly associated with panic attacks [17]. These human findings are fairly consistent with a study where gradually filling a test chamber up to 10% CO2 did not significantly alter rat behavior, but when concentrations approached 15% there was a reduced latency to leave the test chamber, and at 20% the majority of rats left immediately [43]. The relationship between CO2 and panic attacks is further supported in that exposing patients with panic disorder to 5%\u20137% CO2 will provoke panic attacks in the majority of these patients and no panic attacks in healthy controls [44,45,46]. Overall this provides further evidence of the aversive nature of exposure to 7.5%\u201320% CO2. ",

In the evaluation of chamber gas concentrations for Experiment 2b, both the 30% and 100% CO2 volume per minute displacement methods led to rapid increases in ambient CO2 concentrations, which increased to 25% within 1 min. Both reached greater than 90% within 4 min and there were minimal differences in the rate of change. However the 10% CO2 volume per minute displacement method led to a gradual increase in ambient CO2 concentration that was approximately 7%\u201320% within the first 2 min and 30% within 3 min, which suggests these rats remained in panic inducing ranges of CO2 concentrations significantly longer than the other higher CO2 displacement methods. All of the methods led to fairly rapid decreases in blood pressure within 4 min for 100%, and 5 min for 10% and 30%, and a decrease in heart rate within 1 min for 10% and 2 min for 30% and 100%.",

The telemetry probes have an operational range of 34 to 41 \u00b0C, so any temperatures that are below 34 \u00b0C are no longer accurate. However, we have a manuscript in resubmission clearly demonstrating that the 5 min 20% CO2 exposure used here elicits a robust 7\u20139 \u00b0C increase in tail temperatures (due to active vasodilation of tail artery) that precedes the decrease in core temperature. Thus, this drop in core body temperature is not just due to a cessation of metabolic and locomotor activity, but an active cooling mechanism. This hypothesis is consistent with human and rodent data showing that CO2 has local cutaneous vasodilatory action [47,48]. ",

            "text": "Our evaluations of CO2 concentrations are consistent with findings that were previously reported regarding how the concentration of CO2 changes in the chamber over time with constant volume per minute displacement flow rates [1,49]. Of concern, when using a volume per minute displacement rate of 10%, the environmental concentrations of CO2 reached levels associated with anxiety within 1 min of the initiation of the CO2 flow. The concentrations of 40%\u201350%, which have been demonstrated to induce loss of consciousness [1,7], were not achieved until approximately 5 min after the initiation of the CO2 flow. This meant that the animal would be exposed to anxiety- and panic-inducing concentrations of CO2, without loss of consciousness, for at least 4 min. Contrast this with the volume per minute displacement rate of 30%. In this case, the anxiety inducing threshold was also achieved within 1 min of the initiation of CO2 flow, but the environmental concentration of CO2 exceeded 50% approximately 2 min after the initiation of CO2 flow. In this case, the animal would be exposed to anxiety- and panic-inducing concentrations of CO2, without loss of consciousness, for approximately 1 min. This interval was shortened further when a 100% volume per minute displacement flow rate was utilized. However, there is evidence that this could increase the opportunities for exposure to painful concentrations of CO2, where carbonic acid has increased high enough in the respiratory tract to interact with nociceptors to signal a burning sensation [8]. For example, humans inhaling air with 50%\u201360% CO2 were most likely to call the experience unpleasant [50], but inhalations of 80%\u2013100% CO2 were more often reported as painful with self-reports of a burning sensation and difficulty inhaling the gas [8]. Within the same manuscript, the authors exposed rats to different concentrations of CO2 (60%, 70%, 80% and 100%) until anesthesia or euthanization occurred. They reported that the most aversive behaviors (seizures) occurred in lower concentrations of CO2 exposure and were absent to mild with 100% CO2 in most instances. They further noted that trauma to airways and nasal cavities occurred in these lower concentrations of CO2, as well, though it is not clear if the animals were conscious when the trauma occurred. Thus, the short exposure humans had to CO2 may have led to a fast aversive response [51], but prolonged exposure (anesthesia inducing) to lower concentrations of CO2 could produce enough carbonic acid to elicit similar burning and pain as high concentrations of CO2 that would likely be prolonged since time to anesthesia would be delayed, but this has not been explored. In all of these cases, it is necessary to balance the potential for pain (likely higher for a short period of time with a 100% volume per minute displacement rate) with the possibility for distress (likely higher for a prolonged period of time with a 10% volume per minute displacement rate). The lower the flow of the volume per minute displacement rate, the more time the animal would be left in concentrations of gas that are well-documented to cause anxiety and panic prior to loss of consciousness, which occurs at concentrations of 40%\u201350%, dependent upon equilibration of the CO2 gas [1,7]. This strongly suggests that while the low flow volume per minute displacement rates may minimize pain, they increase the distress experienced by the animal.",

With the available tools, defining the exact time of loss of consciousness is challenging because we lack the ability to create a clear determination of when this loss of consciousness has occurred. In humans, loss of consciousness is generally accepted to have occurred at the time when the individual is no longer able to engage in verbal communication [6], but this definition is compounded by the fact that humans can engage in significant and appropriate verbal communication with others that is not recalled when under the effect of alcohol or drugs [52,53]. It has been suggested that electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to assess consciousness in animals [1,54,55], but as EEG measurements are present in anesthetized and sleeping animals, this assessment tool is not necessarily as specific as desired [54,55,56]. In animals, the loss of righting reflex is generally accepted as the marker of loss of consciousness [1,6], but again, pinpointing this exact moment is difficult, especially when using gaseous agents where opening the chamber to test the animal affects the concentration and distribution of the gas. If the ability to handle the animal is built into the cage (as was done in one study [57]), this could lead to more reliable assessments of the loss of righting reflex. ",

We had initially determined that the point when the rat let its nose touch the cage bottom would be the time for loss of consciousness, but this behavior was inconsistent in the groups. Instead we considered the gross loss of motor function as the point where the rat either touched its nose to the ground or began staggering with significant ataxia. It is recognized that both of these measures are very subjective and may not be reflective of the actual state of consciousness of the animals. However, it is worth noting that the interval to achieve this gross loss of motor control was significantly less than anticipated based on the measurements in the empty chamber. For example, in the empty chamber, we projected that the rat would be conscious for as long as 4\u20135 min when euthanized using a 10% volume pre minute displacement rate, but our behavioral data suggested that the loss of consciousness occurred closer to 1.5\u20132 min, though the behavioral data of the rat euthanized with a 100% volume per minute displacement rate was consistent with the predicted loss of consciousness around 25 s. Aside from the concern about the subjective definition of loss of consciousness affecting this discrepancy, it should also be noted that the presence of the animal in the chamber would create turbulence because of its movements and thermal load which could lead to better mixing of the carbon dioxide to facilitate exposure that would not be seen in the empty chamber.",

For humans, during suffocation, CO2 increases and O2 decreases, stimulating an air hunger response with compensatory respiratory and cardiovascular responses [46]. When the levels of CO2 are increased to 20%, but oxygen levels are kept stable at 21%, an air hunger panic is evidenced by a strong sense of suffocation (dyspnea) that is accompanied by symptoms strongly associated with panic attacks (e.g., fear of dying, shortness of breath, and cardioexcitation [17,58]). Here, in rats, we also see increased anxiety-associated behavior and escape- or flight-associated behaviors that coincide with robust cardiorespiratory responses following exposure to 20% CO2 in normoxic air. Thus, being exposed to high concentrations of CO2 in the absence of any change in O2 is clearly panicogenic. ",

Adding oxygen to the euthanasia chamber when using carbon dioxide may not minimize distress, but may actually increase the distress experienced by the animal [1]. As demonstrated by the oxygen measurements in the empty euthanasia chamber during the infusion of CO2 gas, the 10% volume per minute displacement rate results in a very slow loss of oxygen. Therefore, in addition to the animals being exposed to concentrations of CO2 that are anxiety inducing, their cardiovascular and respiratory functions are kept in a manner that induces an acute air hunger, as well. In contrast, when the 30% and 100% volume per minute displacement flow rates for CO2 are utilized, there is an acute drop off of oxygen over the first 2\u20133 min. This decrease in oxygen would be expected to induce a \u201cdrowsiness\u201d response in the animals, further decreasing the potential for distress associated with these volume per minute displacement rates of CO2. Currently, this is only an observation, and a future study comparing CO2 displacement concentrations in normoxic, hypoxic, and hyperoxic conditions would be needed to test this hypothesis.",

A typical calm rat will have a mean arterial pressure of approximately 120 mmHg and a heart rate of 360 to 380 beats per minute. Historically, our laboratory has seen mean arterial blood pressures of 140 mmHg and heart rates of 400 to 450 beats per minute during a panic episode induced by exposure to 20% CO2 [20,23]. In this data, the animals were all exhibiting these elevated levels during the 5 min that they were in the chamber prior to induction of the euthanasia process. This is likely explained because, in this study, rats were removed from their home cage and placed into the novel euthanasia chamber. Although it is generally recommended that animals remain in their home cage when being euthanized, it should be recognized that this practice is variable across institutions and actively discouraged during the induction of anesthesia with other inhalant gases (such as isoflurane) for survival procedures. It should also be recognized that there are often other stressors, such as the stress of transport or comingling of groups of animals, that are also frequently done at the time of euthanasia. So, although current best practices for euthanasia suggest that it is preferential to transport the home cage containing the animal to the euthanasia chamber [59] and let the animal acclimate to its new surroundings for at least 30 min prior to initiating the euthanasia procedures (as demonstrated by the first study presented here), this is not uniformly recognized.

However, there was an increase in the mean arterial pressure of the animals that were euthanized using the 10% volume per minute displacement rate in the first 2 min following the initiation of the CO2 gas infusion. This is suggestive of increased sympathetic activity and distress experienced by the animal. At 3 min post-induction of CO2, the mean arterial pressure of the rats exposed to the 100% volume per minute displacement rate of CO2 drops below baseline, but this drop does not occur until approximately 4 min for the other two volume per minute displacement rate groups. This is likely due to the delayed onset of freezing behaviors that would be expected in the rats exposed to the lower volume per minute displacement flow rates, though these behaviors were not seen in the rats euthanized for this study.

The significance of this drop in locomotion could be representative of a loss of consciousness, though we did not attempt to characterize loss of consciousness in this study. Loss of consciousness for humans is defined as the point where the person can no longer verbally respond, but for animals, the loss of righting reflex is generally accepted as the point of loss of consciousness [1]. However, it is challenging to determine exactly when this point occurs because different observers may determine that the animal has lost its ability to right itself at different times. ",

As other studies have demonstrated that concentrations of at least 40% CO2 are required to induce a loss of consciousness (dependent upon chamber conditions and definition of loss of consciousness used by the study), these animals were clearly demonstrating dyspnea and distress during this period of time.

            "text": "Carbon dioxide anesthesia overdose is an important and appropriate method of euthanasia for laboratory rats, but refinements are necessary to ensure that the pain and distress experienced by the rat is minimized. The use of volume per minute displacement flow rates instead of precharged chambers when using carbon dioxide for euthanasia is critical to prevent the exposure of animals to noxious stimuli that can result in pain. However, the results of this study suggest that the use of very low volume per minute displacement flow rates (such as 10% volume displacement per minute) for carbon dioxide in rats has the potential to significantly increase the distress experienced by the animals. This distress is induced by the prolonged period of time that the rats are exposed to concentrations of CO2 that are known to induce panic and anxiety and the concurrent stabilization of oxygen levels in the chamber, which is known to induce air hunger in the face of elevations of CO2. The elevations in mean arterial blood pressure of the rats euthanized with the 10% volume per minute displacement rate beyond the elevations that were already induced by the stress of transport and novel environment support this finding. Alternatively, the use of medium to high volume per minute displacement flow rates result in a minimizing of potential distress experienced by the rat through the shortening of the period of time that the rats are exposed to concentrations of CO2 that are known to induce panic and anxiety and the rapid depletion of O2, which is known to induce a drowsiness prior to loss of consciousness. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that volume per minute displacement rates of 10% should not be used as there is increased potential exposure to pain and distress associated with prolonged exposure to panicogenic concentrations of CO2.",
