We recently demonstrated that surfactin exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting viral membrane fusion [3]. Membrane fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane is essential for enveloped viruses to invade host cells. Surfactin can act directly on virus particles by insertion into the viral envelopes\u2019 lipid bilayer and thereby reduce the membrane fusion rate. In addition, since the lipid components of viral envelopes are provided by the host cell, their composition, structure, and function are widely similar in the enveloped viruses. Surfactin has antiviral activity against numerous enveloped viruses, and it has promise as a broad-spectrum antiviral reagent, however, the effective dose range of surfactin is narrow, merely 4 x the antiviral concentration causes hemolysis and cytotoxicity. In this study we compared chemically synthesized surfactin analogues to determine future directions for surfactin modification.",

The production of designer surfactins, made by changing the number and composition of amino acids and fatty acids has proven to be an effective strategy for screening large numbers of lipopeptides for biological activity, but most current research focuses on their anticancer [4], antimicrobial [5] and insulin delivery [6] properties but not on their antiviral potential. Fatty acid chain length is critical to the antimicrobial effect of synthetic polymyxin analogues [7], while the specific antimicrobial spectrum of these analogues depends the amino acids in the lipopeptide [8]. Additionally, in synthetic daptomycin analogues, the introduction of aromatic groups in the fatty acid moiety also affects antibacterial activity [9]. In this study, a series of similar lipopeptides were designed and synthesized using surfactin as a template. These analogues differ from each other in the number of hydrophobic amino acids, number of hydrophilic groups, charge properties, amino acid chirality, position of hydrophilic amino acids, and aromatic groups in the fatty chain.",

Outbreaks of PEDV have been reported in many countries [11\u201314], and have caused immeasurable losses to the global swine industry. Recent research in our lab showed that surfactin acts directly on the PEDV envelope and inhibits the fusion process with the host cell membrane.

Those of SLP1, SLP2, SLP3, and surfactin are similar, suggesting that the number of hydrophobic amino acids has little effect on hemolytic activity. However, other modifications significantly affect activity; SLP4, SLP3 and SLP5 have one, two and three carboxyl groups respectively, and the hemolytic activity is reduced in turn. In addition, the chiral differences that distinguish SLP7 and SLP3 at two amino acid residues, and the differences in the arrangement of amino acids between SLP8 and SLP9 also affect hemolytic activity. These results indicate that amino acid composition by itself does not completely determine the characteristics of SLPs. It is noteworthy that SLP8 has an unexpected effect on porcine erythrocytes. Although SLP8 has a low hemolytic activity, it prevents the precipitation of red bloods under our assay conditions at concentrations above 50 \u03bcg/ml.",

Time of addition assays were performed to determine whether the SLP5 exerts its anti-PEDV effect at the same stage during infection as surfactin. Since surfactin acts directly on virions, the experiment was designed to examine events early in the infection process. Fig 6A summarizes the experimental plan and the eight treatments tested. Briefly, SLP5, surfactin, or DEPE was added to virus alone, cells alone, or to cells and virus together prior to infection, during virus adsorption, during virus invasion (1 h post infection at 37 \u00b0C), or during replication (1\u201312 hpi). Samples were harvested 12 hours after infection, and analyzed to measure cellular levels of viral protein (Fig 6B and 6C) and viral RNA (Fig 6D). As expected for a normal component of the cell membrane, DEPE did not affect PEDV replication at any stage, while SLP5 and surfactin exhibited antiviral activity at specific stages. For example, when SLP5 or surfactin are present throughout the experiment (treatment group 2), little PEDV replication occurs, as indicated by nucleic acid and protein levels. The same is true in treatment group 5, indicating that both compounds act directly on the virus. Other antiviral mechanisms of SLP5 and surfactin cannot be ruled out since PEDV replication is inhibited to different degrees in some of the other treatment groups.",

Fatty acid chain length from 8 to 16 carbon atoms is positively correlated with antimicrobial activity, but is also positively correlated with hemolytic activity and membrane selectivity [24]. These factors must be considered in the design of new lipopeptides, and the structure-function relationships warrant further study.

Although SLP4 has one less hydrophilic amino acid than SLP3, its antiviral activity increases about 3-fold. This result indicates that the hydrophilic portion of the wedge-shaped lipid needs to be sized appropriately for better antiviral function.

Cyclic lipopeptides are reported to more readily lyse bacterial membranes than linear or branched lipopeptides [26]. In agreement, we found that the hemolytic activity of SLP1 (a linear molecule, identical in amino acid sequence to surfactin) is slightly weaker than that of surfactin, which has a cyclic structure. It has also been reported that the total hydrophobicity of synthetic lipopeptides is inversely related to hemolytic activity, although this conclusion was from data on only 3 related samples [27]. Our results do not support this conclusion. The relative hydrophobicity of SLP1, 2, and 3 is SLP1>SLP2>SLP3, as indicated by their HPLC retention times (17.6, 16.7, and 14.5 min, respectively).

Compared with surfactin, the structure of SLP5 is distinguished by its linear lipopeptide and the additional carboxyl group at the C' of the peptide. SLP5 also has two fewer hydrophobic amino acids than surfactin, this reduces the cost of synthesis while having little effect on antiviral activity. Since surfactin has been shown to protect piglets from PEDV challenge [3], the in vivo antiviral properties of surfactin analogues needs to be tested. Furthermore, with respect to the future use of synthetic surfactins to control or ameliorate infection in pigs, the broader spectrum physiological activities of surfactin analogues needs further study and side effects beyond hemolytic toxicity need to be explored.
