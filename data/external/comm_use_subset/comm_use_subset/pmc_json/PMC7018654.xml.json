The hypervariable domain interacts with multiple cellular proteins important for virus replication (13\u201318), and the zinc-binding domain has a role in the synthesis of viral RNA (19\u201322). The highly conserved MD consists of a central beta sheet surrounded by four to six helices, a protein fold that exists in all kingdoms of life, including a few families of plus-strand RNA viruses (23\u201327). MDs bind ADP-ribose (ADPr) on proteins posttranslationally modified by either monomers or polymers of ADPr, a modification known as ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation is catalyzed by enzymes of the ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin\u2013like family of proteins commonly known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that transfer ADPr from NAD+ to specific residues on target proteins (28\u201334).",

Viral MDs are of the Macro D subclass that also has ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity and therefore can remove ADP-ribosylation from modified proteins (26, 41\u201345). Because several PARPs are regulated by interferon (IFN), have antiviral properties, and are under evolutionary diversifying selection (46\u201349), it has been postulated that the primary function of viral MDs is to counter the host response to infection by removing ADPr from modified host proteins (50, 51). However, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) with nsP3 MD mutations resulting in little or no hydrolase or binding activity is not viable in either mammalian or insect cells, indicating an important role for the alphavirus MD in virus replication (43). CHIKV with mutations that reduced, but did not eliminate, ADPr-binding or hydrolase activity were viable, but replication in neural cells and virulence for newborn mice were impaired. Further in vitro studies showed that ADPr-binding is necessary for initiation of replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates the amplification of replication complexes (37). However, the effects on neurovirulence have received limited attention.",

Previous studies have shown that mutation D10A in the ADPr-binding site is not tolerated, while mutation N24A results in viable virus with impaired shutoff of host protein synthesis and decreased virulence (55, 56). In the current studies, multiple SINV MD mutants were characterized biochemically and assessed for replication in neural cells, neurovirulence, and immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS) and showed that ADPr-binding and hydrolase functions of the nsP3 MD differentially affect the outcome of CNS infection.",

N24 is within the hydrolase loop and coordinates binding to the distal ribose, as does Y114. G32 is also in the hydrolase loop, and previous studies showed that amino acid substitutions at the equivalent of this position can fine-tune hydrolase activity (27, 41, 43, 44, 50, 57). Purified wild-type (WT) and recombinant nsP3 MD mutant N24A, G32S, G32A, G32E, Y114A, and G32E/I113R/Y114N (triple-mutant [TM]) strains were assessed for MAR hydrolase activity (Fig. 1A and B) and ADPr-binding (Fig. 1C) (43, 58).",

Therefore, we reasoned that a free PAR chain labeled at the 1\u2033 terminus with a fluorescent probe could serve as a substrate for determining the binding affinity of the SINV nsP3 MDs for ADP-ribosylated substrates using fluorescence-based biophysical methods such as microscale thermophoresis (MST) (62). To generate a defined PAR chain fluorescently labeled at the 1\u2033 terminus, we used enzymatically made PAR and cleaved it from modified proteins with alkaline hydrolysis that results in loss of the terminal phosphoribose moiety, generating a 5\u2032-phosphate (63). After purifying PAR to defined length with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), 1-ethyl-3-(N,N-dimethylamino)isopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) coupling was used to introduce an alkyne at the 1\u2033 terminus of (ADPr)18. Cy5-azide was then conjugated to alkyne-(ADPr)18 via Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition. Cy5-(ADPr)18 was incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of SINV WT and mutant MDs, followed by MST analyses. From these assays, we determined that the nsP3 MD WT binds to Cy5-(ADPr)18 with a KD\nof 44.49 \u00b1 2.46 \u03bcM (Fig. 1C), a value comparable to the affinity of the homologous CHIKV nsP3 MD for free ADPr (27, 43). The affinities of SINV nsP3 MD mutants for Cy5-(ADPr)18, were higher for Y114A (34.81 \u00b1 4.66 \u03bcM) and TM (7.54 \u00b1 0.65 \u03bcM), while G32A (46.39 \u00b1 3.19 \u03bcM) resulted in no change in affinity, and all other mutations (G32S, 87.78 \u00b1 7.71 \u03bcM; N24A 83.54 \u00b1 6.55 \u03bcM) had reduced affinity, with G32E (849.76 \u00b1 76.79 \u03bcM) essentially showing no ability to bind PAR which serves as a proxy for ADP-ribosylated substrates in cells (Fig. 1C).",

Infectious virus production by TM was most impaired (Fig. 2A), and sequencing of virus from 12 and 24 h showed mutation of G32E to G32S and reversion of position 113 from R to I and position 114 from N to Y.

To determine the role of the nsP3 MD in the pathogenesis of encephalomyelitis, we infected 2-week-old CD1 mice intracranially with 1,000 PFU of WT SINV and nsP3 MD mutants N24A, G32A, G32E, G32S, Y114A, and TM (Fig. 3). Signs of disease appeared later (day 4) in mice infected with G32A, G32S, and TM than in mice infected with WT SINV or mutants N24A, G32E, and Y114A (day 3) (Fig. 3B). Mice infected with WT virus developed ataxia and an abnormal gait with progressive paralysis, and all died by 9 days postinfection (mean day of death [MDOD] = 6.2) (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, mice infected with G32E also developed fatal encephalomyelitis with a time course similar to that of WT virus-infected mice (MDOD = 6), as did mice infected with N24A (84% mortality; MDOD = 6.4). Disease was least severe in mice infected with G32A with 32% mortality (MDOD = 9.6, P < 0.0001), G32S with 29% mortality (MDOD = 8.2, P < 0.0001) and TM with 30% mortality (MDOD = 8.7, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3A). Surviving mice in these groups recovered neurologic function by 14 days after infection (Fig. 3B). Mice infected with Y114A had an intermediate phenotype with 60% mortality (MDOD = 6.8, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3A), and surviving mice had persistent hind limb paralysis (Fig. 3B) despite a gain in body weight that was similar to that of G32S and G32A survivors (Fig. 3C).",

As observed during replication in NSC34 cells, G32E reverted to WT G and TM mutated to G32S and reverted to 113I and 114Y, while N24A retained this mutation. Thus, the two viruses with the G32E MD mutation were rapidly selected against during growth in neural cells both in vitro and in vivo. For G32E, reversion to G conferred WT virulence in mice, while selection of G32S in TM, along with reversion of position 113 to I and position 114 to Y led to virulence similar to single mutant G32S (Fig. 3A). Viruses with other MD mutations were less neurovirulent than WT but differed in whether survivors recovered neurologic function. Because G32E and TM reverted, N24A had been studied previously (55), and G32S and G32A had similar phenotypes, subsequent studies focused on comparisons between WT, G32S (decreased binding and hydrolase) and Y114A (increased binding and decreased hydrolase).",

The levels of viral RNA were generally lower for G32S than for the WT in both the brain and spinal cord at all times after infection, while the levels of Y114A were similar or higher than the WT. Therefore, replication of G32S in the CNS was impaired compared to the WT with rapid clearance, whereas the replication of Y114A was similar to the WT, but with impaired clearance.",

In addition, although Parp mRNAs are not induced by infection of NSC34 cells, PARPs are activated for ADP-ribosylation and facilitate CHIKV replication (37). To determine whether Parp mRNA expression was induced by CNS infection, we measured changes in levels of selected Parp mRNAs in brain and spinal cord by qRT-PCR (Fig. 5A and B). Expression of Parp1 mRNA changed little, but mRNAs for Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14 were increased by infection. At 2 days after infection, the brain levels of Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14 mRNAs and the spinal cord levels of Parp14 mRNA were higher in Y114A-infected mice than in either WT or G32S-infected mice. To determine whether PARP14 protein levels were increased after infection, brain and spinal cord homogenates were probed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5C and D). PARP14 protein levels increased in the CNS after infection with all three viruses with higher levels at 4 days (P < 0.0001 versus WT/G32S) and lower levels at 6 days (P < 0.05 versus WT, P < 0.0001 versus G32S) in the brains of Y114A-infected mice. Therefore, a subset of Parp mRNAs was increased after infection with generally higher levels induced by Y114A than WT or G32S infection.",

Isg15 mRNA was higher in brains of WT- and Y114A-infected mice than G32S-infected mice throughout the infection and in the spinal cord at 4 days (P < 0.0001). Therefore, although IFN levels in the brain were highest with WT infection (Fig. 6B), Y114A generally induced a more vigorous and sustained ISG response than G32S or WT virus infection (Fig. 5, 6A, and 7), perhaps associated with the generally higher levels and slower clearance of viral RNA (Fig. 4).",

The mRNA for regulatory cytokine Il10 increased after infection, with the highest levels in the brains of WT-infected mice at 6 days (P < 0.0001) and in spinal cords at 4 days (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 10B). These data suggest that SINV with MD mutations induce a more vigorous IFN-\u03b3-producing T cell response to infection than WT SINV, particularly in the spinal cord.",

Previous studies of CHIKV nsP3 MD mutants showed that these activities are critical for different aspects of alphavirus replication in neuronal cells (37, 43, 55). If both functions are impaired, initiation of infection is inefficient, and little if any virus is produced. If there is better binding but diminished hydrolase activity, replication is initiated more quickly, but the amplification of replication complexes is impaired (37). To determine how altered MD functions affect the pathogenesis of encephalomyelitis, we introduced mutations similar to those studied in CHIKV into SINV, a better model system for analysis of CNS alphavirus infection in mice, and showed that the effects on ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities were similar to those observed for CHIKV.",

Mutation of this critical binding residue leads to a failure to synthesize viral RNA in neural cells, so that any virus recovered had either reverted to D, T, or N or acquired a compensatory mutation at position 31 (E to G) (37, 55). The hydrolase loop formed by residues 24 to 33 also participates in ADPr-binding (necessary for enzyme function), but enzymatic activity per se is less critical for initiating alphavirus replication (37). The amino acid at position 24 (N) is conserved in all viral MDs examined (50, 51), and mutation of N24 to A eliminated hydrolase activity (Fig. 1) and impairs shutoff host protein synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells (56) but did not affect replication in NSC34 cells (Fig. 2A). However, mortality in 2-week-old mice was reduced from 100 to 84% in the present study (Fig. 3A) and to 40% in our previous study (55) and is associated with more rapid virus clearance. The reasons for differences in mortality between the two studies are not known but may be due to differences in genetic background or microbiome composition of outbred CD-1 mice. The phenotype was similar to that observed with mutation at the comparable position of the SARS-CoV MD (N41A/N1040A) that does not affect replication in Vero or Calu-3 2B4 epithelial cells but decreases lung virus replication and improves survival of mice after respiratory infection. These results were postulated to be linked to MD regulation of innate response genes with higher lung levels of IFN, ISG, IL-6 and TNF mRNAs at 24 h, but not 72 h, after infection (40). The specific mechanisms for these effects have yet to be identified.",

Mutation of G32 to S or A partially preserved ADPr-binding, with hydrolase activity decreased 26.5% for G32S and 28% for G32A (Fig. 1). These viruses replicated less well in NSC34 cells than did the WT (Fig. 2) and induced less severe neurologic disease with reduced mortality in mice (Fig. 3). Replication of G32S in the CNS was lower than that of the WT, with the most striking difference in the spinal cord (Fig. 4). We postulate that decreased virus production is due to less efficient initiation and amplification of replication in neurons, as observed in vitro for CHIKV G32S (37), resulting in decreased spread of virus to the spinal cord. Therefore, efficient replication complex formation and amplification in neurons likely requires binding to one or more yet to be identified ADP-ribosylated proteins.",

The amino acid at 114 is more variable in alphaviruses than the other residues studied with a Y in EEEV and WEEV, as well as SINV and CHIKV, but F in VEEV. The Y114A substitution in SINV increases binding while decreasing hydrolase activity (Fig. 1) (43) and thus provides an opportunity to independently examine the role of MD hydrolase activity in pathogenesis. As for CHIKV (37, 43), SINV Y114A grew more slowly in NSC34 cells (Fig. 2) and was less virulent in mice (Fig. 3). However, Y114A replicated as well or better than WT SINV in the CNS, was cleared more slowly from both brain and spinal cord, and resulted in permanent neurologic damage in survivors (Fig. 4). Initial control of SINV replication in the CNS is dependent on the innate immune response, particularly local production of type I IFN (77\u201379). Because viral MDs can influence both the induction of and the response to innate immune effectors (40, 65, 80, 81), we assessed multiple parameters of the immune response to SINV in the CNSs of infected mice. Mice infected with Y114A in general had similar CNS levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 and greater induction of ISGs Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14; Ifit1 and -2; and Isg15 (Fig. 5 and 7) and innate response genes Tlr3, Il1\u03b2, Il6, Tnf, Ccl2, Ccl5, and Cxcl10 (Fig. 8) compared to WT-infected mice. Because these same parameters tended to be lower in G32S-infected mice where viral RNA loads were also lower than WT, we postulate that MD-determined levels of virus replication in the CNS have a more important role in regulating innate responses than direct MD regulation of these responses.",

SINV clearance is mediated by the adaptive immune response with the combined effects of antibody and IFN-\u03b3 (74, 75, 82, 83). Although production of serum IgM was decreased in Y114A-infected animals compared to WT and G32S-infected mice, levels of SINV-specific IgM and IgG, as well as Ifn\u03b3 mRNA, in the brains and spinal cords were similar or higher (Fig. 9 and 10). Therefore, defects in clearance could not be ascribed to failure to induce an adaptive immune response. Because the mechanisms of antibody-mediated and IFN-\u03b3-mediated clearance of virus from neurons are not known and MD hydrolase activity affects amplification of replication complexes, shutoff of host protein synthesis and translation of structural proteins (37), it is possible that MD interactions with intracellular mechanisms of virus clearance are affected by the mutations studied.",

Immunoblots of brain (A and B) and spinal cord (C and D) homogenates (20 \u03bcg of 10% [wt/vol]) were probed for total and phosphorylated STAT1. Antibody against \u03b2-actin was used for loading controls. The levels of pSTAT1 (Y701) and STAT1 (91- + 84-kDa band) relative to the actin in brain (A) and spinal cord (C) were quantitated using densitometry from five blots and are presented as a bar graph. Significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparison test. *, P < 0.05 (WT versus G32S). ##, P < 0.01 (G32S versus Y114A).
