            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, wildlife, and agriculture are often the result of a pathogen jumping from its original host into a novel host species. This can take the form of spillover events that result in dead end infections or short stuttering transmission chains, or a host shift with successful infection and sustained transmission in the new host (Box 1). Host shifts have resulted in multiple human pandemics, such as HIV from chimps [1] and the H1N1 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d from birds [2], which have both killed tens of millions of people. Other important human pathogens have originated from other host species, including Plasmodium falciparum\n[3], SARS coronavirus [4], Hendra and Nipah viruses [5], and the measles virus [6]. Past host shifts can be detected when the phylogenies of hosts and their pathogens are different (phylogenetic incongruence\u2014Box 1). This is very common, with a survey of the published literature finding 93% of studies comparing host and pathogen phylogenies showed evidence of host shifts [7], and there are relatively few cases where the pathogen phylogeny mirrors that of its host completely [8].",

Following a host shift, selection will favour mutations that allow a pathogen to (a) enter a host cell with greater efficiency and (b) \u201cfine tune\u201d or optimise their fitness in the new host, for example by better utilising cellular machinery, enhancing immune avoidance, optimising virulence, and maximising transmission potential. Our focus is on viruses, owing to a wealth of recent studies, and because RNA viruses are the most likely group of pathogens to jump between hosts, possibly because of their ability to rapidly adapt to new hosts [9]\u2013[12]. While we focus on genetics in this review, behaviour and ecological processes are clearly a hugely important factor in determining whether a novel host is exposed to a novel pathogen, and whether onward transmission occurs [10], [13]\u2013[15].",

This is presumably because close relatives of the natural host offer a similar environment to that which the pathogen is adapted to. This is likely to be especially important for pathogens because of the myriad of molecular interactions pathogens have with their hosts to infect cells, utilise resources, and avoid or suppress the host immune response.",

By reconstructing the phylogeny of rabies viruses isolated from various species of bat in North America, it has been possible to look at the patterns of cross species transmission in the wild. The rate of cross species transmission was greatest for closely related species [22] whether looking at spillover events (recent infections that might not persist long-term) or host shifts that successfully became established [13]. Similarly, viruses and other parasites of mammals are most likely to be shared by more closely related hosts [10], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Additionally, the phylogenies of hantaviruses and their rodent and insectivore hosts show evidence for host switching, with data suggestive of preferential shifts between closely related species [27]. However, within these examples there are cases of pathogens transferring successfully over great phylogenetic distances [28], [29].",

This may mean that the host phylogeny is a patchwork of clades with varying levels of susceptibility, with clades of susceptible hosts scattered across the tree, sometimes in taxa distantly related to the pathogen's natural host. This has been demonstrated in experimental cross infections of fruit flies and sigma viruses [16], where after accounting for distance from the viruses' natural hosts, the effect of the host phylogeny explained almost all of the remaining variation in viral load. If this pattern is common, it may explain cases where viruses and other pathogens recurrently shift between distantly related taxa, such as transmission of influenza viruses among birds, pigs, and humans [2], or human to bovid transmission of Staphylococcus aureus\n[31], although host ecology likely also plays a role in these instances.",

Furthermore, changes in the ability to bind host cells can also be essential for host shifts by viruses of vertebrates. This is the case for the influenza virus, which binds to sialic acid receptors, of which there are two basic types (SA\u03b1-2,3- and SA\u03b1-2,6-Gal-terminated saccharides) [33]. Avian influenza viruses bind SA\u03b1-2,3 receptors in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds. Conversely, human seasonal influenza viruses predominantly bind to SA\u03b1-2,6 receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans. However, humans possess SA\u03b1-2,3-sialic acid receptors in the lower respiratory tract. Though it is relatively difficult for influenza viruses to get into and out of the lower respiratory tract, avian influenza viruses do occasionally infect humans. Such infections typically result in severe disease with little or no secondary transmission. Successful adaptation to humans requires mutations to the SA receptor binding site in the hemagglutinin gene that allow the virus to utilise SA\u03b1-2,6 receptors and thus increase the potential for efficient transmission between humans [33]. A related example of the importance of changes in receptor binding is the switch of parvoviruses from cats to dogs, which was due to two mutations in the viral capsid gene that allow it to bind the canine transferrin receptor [40].",

Accordingly, the high mutation rate of RNA viruses may explain why they host shift more frequently than other pathogens [12]. However, most mutations will be deleterious or lethal [42], [43], so the chances of a host shift will be maximised at an intermediate mutation rate [41], [44] (although it has been shown in a plant virus that the fraction of mutations that are deleterious can be reduced in a novel host [45]).

At one extreme, a single mutation allowed Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus to replicate efficiently in horses when it switched from rodents in the early 1990s [46]. Similarly, single mutations can underlie the expansion of the host range of RNA phages [47]. In contrast, five amino acid changes are predicted to be required for some Avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses to acquire the ability to be transmitted between ferrets [48]. If multiple mutations are required to successfully host shift, their availability can impose a constraint on host range evolution. This is illustrated by experiments on a DNA phage of Pseudomonas fluorescens\n[36]. The phage rapidly evolved to infect certain host genotypes but never adapted to others. The successful shifts were associated with one to three mutations in genes affecting host binding, whilst more mutations were required to infect the other hosts (these could be acquired through a process of coevolution; see below).",

When vesicular stomatitis virus is evolved in human or dog cells, parallel mutations tend to occur within the same cell type [50]. Similarly in plants, experimental evolution of Tobacco etch potyvirus on four host species found that parallel mutations only occurred when viruses were passaged in the same host species [53]. A number of other studies in plants have found parallel mutations occurring, often after only a few passages on the novel host [54]\u2013[57]. Experimental studies finding parallel mutations often enforce transmission and so bypass the critical barrier of successful transmission in the new host. Therefore, looking at the mutations that occur in chains of natural transmission is an important future direction, as, for example, the size of the mutational target may be different for cell entry compared to transmission [58].",

This has occurred in different HIV lineages that shifted into humans from other primates (Figure 2C). HIV-1 group M, which is responsible for the global pandemic, arose following a host shift by the chimpanzee virus SIVcpz [1]. In both human and chimp cells a restriction factor called tetherin can prevent the release of viral particles from infected cells [61]. In chimps, the SIVcpz protein Nef has anti-tetherin activity, but this is ineffective in humans due to a deletion in the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin that is targeted by Nef. Instead, in HIV-1 group M, the Vpu protein has evolved to perform the same function [61]. This was paralleled in HIV-2, which originates from sooty mangabeys (Figure 2C). The sooty mangabey virus also uses Nef as a tetherin antagonist and again this is ineffective in humans, but in this case the function has been acquired by the Env protein (HIV-2 lacks the Vpu protein) [61].",

In laboratory studies of interactions between DNA phage and bacteria, it has been found that reciprocal coevolution allows phage to build up broad host ranges through the stepwise accumulation of multiple mutations in genes associated with host binding [36]. Additionally pathogens may circulate in host populations at low levels before becoming a detectable outbreak, and this may provide time for the pathogen to evolve adaptations to optimise its fitness in the novel host [62].",

HIV-1 group M and HIV-1 group N have independently shifted from chimpanzees to humans [1], and in both cases the Vpu protein has evolved to antagonise the restriction factor tetherin (see above). Vpu also binds and degrades CD4 receptors in SIV to aid the release of viral particles [63], but this function has been lost in group N viruses, possibly as a pleiotropic consequence of the protein gaining anti-tetherin activity [64]. It has been speculated that this may explain why HIV group N has remained a rare pathogen in Africa, while HIV group M\u2014where the ability to degrade CD4 was retained\u2014has become a pandemic [64].",

Similar patterns have been observed following virus adaptation to different cell culture types [67], [68], plant species [54], [55], and animal species [69].

For example, a vector borne pathogen may be unlikely to shift from a common mosquito species to a rare one as it will normally end up back in the original mosquito vector. In contrast, directly transmitted pathogens like influenza may be able to establish a continuous transmission chain in the new host, so reduced performance on the original host is not important.",

However, following a host shift, a pathogen may produce maladaptive levels of virulence as the novel host\u2013parasite association has not been under direct selection. For example, when the myxoma virus from South American Sylvilagus rabbits was transferred to European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), initial case mortality rates were as high as 99.8% in Australia. The rapid mortality is thought to have reduced the window of time that rabbits were able to transmit the virus, and as a consequence virulence rapidly dropped to case mortality rates of \u223c90% due to the spread of attenuated virus strains [75], [76]. There appear to be large mutational targets to evolve changes in virulence in the myxoma virus (a DNA virus with a large 162 kb genome), with no mutations common to specific virulence grades [77]. Failure to evolve lower levels of virulence may explain the stuttering chains of transmission seen in some spillover events [78], [79]; however, it is difficult to disentangle whether the low rates of transmission are due to maladaptive levels of virulence or from human intervention.",

While we have rules of thumb as to which groups of pathogens are most likely to host shift, and which donor species they are likely to come from [32], there will always be exceptions. This means that predicting disease emergence by fine scale surveillance of potential donor species and the individuals they are most likely to infect is a hugely difficult task [81]. The observation that specific mutations are often required in host shifts has led to studies looking at whether these mutations can be predicted in advance. For H5N1 avian influenza viruses, mammalian transmissible forms have been evolved in laboratory settings, and identified mutations may be markers for potential epidemics [82]\u2013[84]. However, even in this exceptionally well-studied case, predictive power remains low and highly system specific.",

The literature is overwhelmingly skewed towards viruses, but do bacterial and eukaryotic parasites have similar properties? Under what conditions do trade-offs between performance on the original and new host prevent host shifts from happening? Do the mutations involved in host shifts originate as de novo mutations in the new host or come from standing variation in the original host? What determines the size of the mutational target, and does this depend on what the barrier to a host shift is? For example, mutational targets seem to be small for relatively simple traits like changes in receptor use, but may be larger for complex traits like virulence and transmissibility.",

(B) Parallel genetic changes in codon 30 of the gag gene (Met to Arg) following three independent transfers of SIVcpz into humans [59]. When a chimp was subsequently infected with HIV-1, the residue reverted back to Met. The coloured blocks represent either a Met (yellow) or Arg (blue) at codon position 30 in the HIV gag gene. (C) Parallel changes in protein function following independent transfers of SIVs from chimpanzees (HIV-1) and sooty mangabeys (HIV-2) into humans. SIV Nef protein does not antagonise tetherin in humans, and so other HIV proteins have evolved the ability to antagonise tetherin [64]. The exception to this is HIV-1 group O viruses, which do not appear to have evolved anti-tetherin activity. In HIV-1 group N viruses the evolution of anti-tetherin activity in Vpu may have come at a cost, as Vpu no longer degrades CD4 receptors to aid the release of viral particles [61]. The coloured gene names in the schematic represent the gene that provides the anti-tetherin function in that host and viral lineage.",

Both processes result in closely related host species harbouring similar pathogens, and in some host clades harbouring more pathogen species. However, in A, but not B, host species with more close relatives tend to have more pathogens. For example, the phylogenetically isolated species at the bottom of the tree is not infected by any of the three pathogens in A, but is in B.",
