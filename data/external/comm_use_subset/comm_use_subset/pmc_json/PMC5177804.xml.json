Historically, when you look at the period of an epidemic, it is easy to see how many people have tried to control their anxiety by persecuting and discriminating against minorities. During the Black Death epidemic, Gypsies and Jews were persecuted due to rumors that they were poisoning water. There also was a period of fear and persecution of lepers due to rumors that they were harming their children. This is tragic for victims of infectious disease as they have difficulties receiving social support despite being direct victims themselves.",

The experience of cold treatment by close relatives and neighbors gave these patients a deep scar. Once the MERS epidemic comes to an end, we should consider how rumors were inflated and how they affected us and our neighbors. This reflection is necessary because epidemics of infectious diseases will continue to recur in the future. To respond in a more mature way, we need to recognize that the rumors we have too easily accepted resulted in irreversible scars to primary victims by the disease and worsening public anxiety and fear. Underlying the fear and anxiety that prevailed during the MERS epidemic was the uncertainty that I, my family, or someone close to me could become infected. When uncertainties are high, rumors can be exaggerated.",

From a perspective of controlling disasters, it has tendency to delay or postpone providing information because of the belief that bad news will cause people to panic. However, it is important to provide accurate information about the disaster as soon as possible. Missing the appropriate time point could cause rapid spread of rumors. Thus, the ability to communicate with the public via a group of experts is crucial to reduce uncertainty among the general public.",
