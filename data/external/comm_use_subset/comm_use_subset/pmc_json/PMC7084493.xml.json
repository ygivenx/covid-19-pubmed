            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), also known as human herpesvirus 5, is a widespread pathogen among human populations [1,2,3]. To establish a successful infection, HCMV depends on a unique set of immune evasion strategies, using encoded proteins and mRNA to avoid a competent innate and adaptive immune response [4]. HCMV-mediated infections are a recognized cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals as compared to otherwise healthy or immunocompetent individuals [5,6,7]. During the early stages of fetus development, HCMV infection in utero can result in disseminated infection with severe neurological impairments [8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. In addition, HCMV infection can also cause visual impairments in the form of retinitis, which is commonly seen in the AIDS population [15,16,17]. Interestingly, HCMV is capable of infecting multiple cell and tissue types, which suggests its ability to interact with a diverse array of host cell receptors to establish an infection [18,19,20].",

            "text": "HCMV entry into host cells is extremely dynamic due to the usage of a variety of cellular entry receptors during virus-cell interactions [21,22,23,24]. It has been shown that depending on the cell type, HCMV can utilize multiple target cell receptors, including cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), different cellular integrins, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGF-R\u03b1), neuropilin-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), for cellular entry [25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. On the flip side, HCMV\u2019s multiple viral glycoproteins, including gB, gO, and gH-gL, engage these structurally and functionally unrelated receptors to penetrate cellular defenses. For example, gB catalyzes membrane fusion between HCMV and infected cells, while gH/gL-containing complexes regulate viral tropism [24]. Interestingly, these viral glycoproteins contribute differently to different cell-types. Whereas the trimer of HCMV\u2019s gH-gL-gO is critical for infection in fibroblasts, a pentamer unit of gHgLpUL128-131A is essential for viral entry in epithelial, endothelial, and myeloid cells [32,33,34]. The distinctive ability of HCMV to utilize a diversity of cell surface receptors coupled to its exploitation of multiple glycoproteins to mediate entry pose a special challenge for drug discovery because of the possibility of several bypass mechanisms.",

The discovery of new anti-HCMV agents with better efficacy and novel mechanism of action is a critical goal [40]. More specifically, for HCMV it would beneficial to develop an agent that could simultaneously target multiple receptors involved in viral entry so as to more effectively prevent bypass pathways.",

Second, many host cell surface receptors are also known to bind to HS such as growth factor receptors (e.g., PDGF-R and EGF-R) and neuropilin [28], which could offer additional opportunities for competitive inhibition. Third, inhibitors of viral entry could be expected to have downstream consequences such as the expression of viral immediate-early genes, whose products play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCMV infection, and prevention or reduction in host immunomodulation [42].",

The advantage with these mimetics is that these are fully synthetic, easily characterizable, and highly amenable to advanced rational drug design possibilities. We now have a library of some 150 non-saccharide mimetics of heparin/heparan sulfate with different structural scaffolds, diversity of sulfate groups, and molecular sizes [59,60]. One of these agents is sulfated pentagalloylglucoside (SPGG) with a distinct structure to simultaneously mimic many different sequences of heparin/heparan sulfate (Figure 1). The unique aspect of SPGG is its globular structure that theoretically can interact with diverse HS-binding proteins. In fact, our earlier work on SPGG has shown that it interacts with coagulation factor XIa [57,61] and glycoprotein gD [50], two completely different HS-binding proteins. Thus, we reasoned that the probability of targeting multiple proteins involved in cellular entry of HCMV, e.g., glycoprotein gB, PDGF-R, EGF-R, and neuropilin, would be higher with SPGG than with other non-saccharide mimetics developed so far.",

Following a 2-h incubation at RT at an MOI of 5.0, we observed excellent infectivity of the viral strain for both cell-types as monitored by the presence of multiple GFP punctae (aggregates of virions; Figure 3, panels A and D). Addition of SPGG resulted in reduced number of GFP-puncta for both cell types (Supplementary Figure S1). Using ImageJ, the immunolabeled punctae with SPGG treatment were quantified as compared to the mock-treated cell lines. The relative decrease in GFP-puncta as a function of SPGG dose followed the traditional semi-log relationship with an IC50 of 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M for HFF-1 and 1.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M for SK-N-MC cells (Figure 3 panels C, and F). In fact, at the maximal dose studied (100 \u00b5M), SPGG treatment almost completely abolished BAD32GFP internalization (Figure 3B,E).

In this assay, we used \u03b2-galactosidase-expressing reporter HCMV strain (RC256 from ATCC), which upon expression of \u03b2-galactosidase and x-gal staining in the infected cells showed blue foci.

Treatment of HFF-1 with mock-treated HCMV strain RC256 for seven-days followed by x-gal staining and quantification of the blue-colored infected foci under 10\u00d7 magnification led to highly reproducible measurement of viral spread. When 100 \u00b5M SPGG was used to pre-treat the virions, significantly fewer foci were observed after 7 days.

To test this expectation, we studied whether SPGG binds to gB using dot-blot hybridization and cell-ELISA assay. Figure 6 (panels A,B) shows the results of the dot-blot in the presence and absence of SPGG. As the concentration of SPGG increased to 100 \u00b5M, the gB signal reduced 30.5 \u00b1 10% of the untreated control. Although a reduction in signal intensity at lower concentrations (<10 \u00b5M) was noticeable, the inhibition was not as robust as observed with IC50 profiles of viral entry or expression of genes (Figure 3 and Figure 4 above). To further test whether SPGG engages viral entry glycoprotein gB, we studied Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO-K1) that over-express HCMV gB on cell surface. Dot-blot hybridization and cell-ELISA of CHO-K1 cells in the presence of 100 \u00b5M SPGG also led to reduction in gB signal intensity of 34.6 \u00b1 20% in comparison to mock-treated controls (Figure 6C).",

These results are encouraging and likely support that SPGG binds to glycoprotein gB of HCMV, although its affinity is expected to be weaker (10 to 100 \u00b5M). One explanation for this is that the anti-gB antibody and SPGG do not compete ideally for the same site of binding on gB. It is possible that both competitors bind gB simultaneously, albeit in a partially competitive manner, resulting in a less robust competition. Another possibility is that SPGG mediates HCMV inhibition through multiple viral surface receptors, one of which is gB. The foundation for this expectation is that SPGG has been earlier shown to bind tightly to glycoprotein D of HSV [50,51]. Likewise, SPGG also inhibits Chlamydia infection through binding to its cell surface receptors [66]. Finally, potential pathways that could be targeted by SPGG do exist, e.g., the engagement of one or more host cell surface receptors (e.g., PDGF-R, EGF-R, neuropilin, or others). Of the two, the latter is more likely because heparan sulfate and its mimetics are known to be pleiotropic entities.",

Although previous work has demonstrated the concept that certain sulfated, natural, or unnatural polysaccharides (e.g., dextran sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, heparin, copolymers of acrylic acid) can inhibit HCMV infectivity in CHO-K1 and MRC-5 cells [71], the foundation for this activity was based on mimicking the polymeric scaffold of heparan sulfate, which has now been shown to be critical for HCMV entry [72,73,74,75]. In fact, the plausible molecular basis for this competitive inhibition was the interaction of sulfated polymers to viral glycoprotein gB of HCMV [25,26,27]. More specifically, the competitive inhibition was predicted to arise from mimicking the structure of certain heparan sulfates, e.g., 3-O sulfated and 6-O sulfated species [74]. In stark contrast, SPGG is a much smaller sulfated entity that performs the mimicking function with excellent potency. This is important because a smaller molecular scaffold is easier to transform into clinical drug candidates. Whereas polymers are difficult to synthesize, characterize, purify, analyze, monitor, and administer, smaller molecules are the exact opposite. Thus, SPGG provides the first small molecule lead toward discovery of anti-HCMV drugs.",

            "text": "The 2nd major reason for the novelty behind the discovery of SPGG is the possibility of simultaneous engagement of multiple receptors involved in HCMV entry into host cells. Complex interactions between viral envelope glycoproteins and host cell receptors come into play for successful entry [23,24]. One reason why nature seems to have engineered multiplicity of such interactions is to ensure probability of success. To significantly reduce efficiency of entry, it is important to simultaneously impact these interactions. Thus, targeting only interactions of 3-O-sulfated or 6-O-sulfated species, inhibition of HCMV entry may not yield a clinically viable agent. Despite being small, SPGG presents a diverse library of sulfated species that could bind all possible heparan sulfate binding receptors, thereby impeding viral recognition. This appears to be the case because SPGG binding to glycoprotein gB explains only part of the inhibition effect. Thus, pleiotropicity of SPGG interactions may be a key reason for its high anti-HCMV potency.",

As yet no sulfated biopolymer has been demonstrated to display this phenomenon. This finding is important because the products of immediate early genes are essential for viral DNA replication. Therefore, SPGG-like small molecule that display this phenomenon may offer novel strategies for inhibiting HCMV. Likewise, the reduction in viral spread adds more value to the inhibitory role of SPGG. It is important to note that the teratogenicity and toxicity of available HCMV antiviral agents make treatment options during early development markedly limited.",
