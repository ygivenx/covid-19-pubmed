The two parental strains used in this study were N2 and CB4856. N2 is the canonical laboratory strain of C. elegans, which has been studied extensively (Brenner 1974). CB4856 is a well studied Hawaiian wild isolate that is genetically divergent from N2 and has a characterized genome (Wicks et al. 2001; Swan et al. 2002; Thompson et al. 2015). The N2 and CB4856 strains were crossed for several generations to create a panel of RIAILs that contain regions of the genome derived from each parental strain. These RIAILs were constructed previously (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009; Andersen et al. 2015) and have well characterized genotypes and allele frequencies, and we used this panel of RIAILs in our study to identify regions of the genome correlated with drug response. The construction of NILs, as well as CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion and allele-replacement strains, is detailed below. All strains and reagents used in strain constructions are listed in the Supplemental Information.",

Populations of each strain were passaged on 6 cm plates for four generations to amplify animal numbers and reduce the effects of starvation (Andersen et al. 2014). Gravid adults were bleached for stage synchronization, and \u223c25 embryos from each strain were aliquoted into 96-well plates at a final volume of 50 \u00b5l of K medium (Boyd et al. 2012). The following day, arrested L1 larvae were fed 5 mg/ml HB101 bacterial lysate in K medium (Pennsylvania State University Shared Fermentation Facility, State College, PA; (Garc\u00eda-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2017) and were grown for 48 hr at 20\u00b0 with constant shaking. A large-particle flow cytometer (COPAS BIOSORT; Union Biometrica, Holliston, MA) was used to sort three L4 larvae into each well of a 96-well plate that contained 50 \u00b5l K medium plus HB101 lysate at 10 mg/ml, 50 \u00b5M kanamycin, and either 1% distilled water (control) or 1% distilled water and bleomycin (drug). The sorted L4 larvae were grown and propagated for 96 hr at 20\u00b0 with constant shaking. The population of parents and progeny were treated with sodium azide (50 mM in M9), and quantified by the BIOSORT for several fitness parameters. Because bleomycin exposure can affect animal proliferation (brood size), animal growth (length), and animal development (optical density), the fitness parameters we measured with BIOSORT included brood size (n), animal length (time of flight, TOF), and optical density (extinction time, EXT).",

The sumplate function then calculated normalized measurements (norm.n\u2013brood size normalized to number of animals sorted, norm.EXT\u2013EXT normalized by TOF measurements) and summary statistics (mean, median, 10th, 25th, 75th, 90th percentile, interquartile range, covariance, and variance) of each trait for the population of animals. A total of 26 HTA traits were measured. When strains were phenotyped across multiple days, the regress(assay = TRUE) function was used to fit a linear model with the phenotype as the dependent variable and assay as the independent variable (phenotype \u223c assay) to account for variation among assay days. Next, the prune_outliers() function removed phenotypic values that were beyond two standard deviations (SD) of the mean (unless at least 5% of the strains were outside this range in the case of RIAIL assays). Finally, bleomycin-specific effects were calculated using the regress(assay = FALSE) function from easysorter, which fits a linear model with the phenotype as the dependent variable and control phenotype as the independent variable (phenotype \u223c control phenotype). The residual phenotypic values account for differences among strains that were present in control conditions.",

DNA was isolated from 100 to 300 \u00b5l of packed worms using Omega BioTek\u2019s EZ 96 Tissue DNA Kit (catalog no. D1196-01). All samples were diluted to 0.2 ng/\u00b5l and incubated with diluted Illumina transposome (catalog no. FC-121-1031). Tagmented samples were amplified with barcoded primers. Unique libraries (192) were pooled by adding 8 \u00b5l of each library. The pooled material was size-selected by separating the material on a 2% agarose gel, and excising the fragments ranging from 400 to 600 bp. The sample was purified using Qiagen\u2019s Gel Extraction Kit (catalog no. 28706), and eluted in 30 \u00b5l of buffer EB. The concentration of the purified sample was determined using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (catalog no. Q32851). RIAILs and NILs were sequenced at low coverage (mean =2.13\u00d7) using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with a paired-end 100 bp reaction lane. RIAIL and NIL genotypes were imputed using VCF-kit (Cook and Andersen 2017). To determine genotypes, a list of filtered, high-quality sites (n = 196,565), where parental strains possess different genotypes was extracted from a previously established variant dataset (Cook et al. 2016). Whole-genome sequencing genotypes did not match the previous GoldenGate genotypes (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009) for the following RIAILs: QX36, QX73, QX78, and QX160. All RIAIL genotypes can be accessed by downloading the linkagemapping R package at github.com/AndersenLab/linkagemapping, and by running load_cross_obj(\u201cN2xCB4856cross_full\u201d).

The genotypic data and residual phenotypic data (after control-condition regression) were merged into a cross object using the merge_pheno function with set = 2 to include strains with a reduced allele-frequency skew on chromosome I. The fsearch function was used to calculate logarithm of odds (LOD) scores for each marker and each trait as \u2212n(ln(1\u2212R2)/2ln(10)), where R is the Pearson correlation coefficient between RIAIL genotypes at the marker and trait values (Bloom et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2017; Zdraljevic et al. 2017; Evans et al. 2018). A 5% genome-wide error rate was calculated by permuting phenotype and genotype data 1000 times. Mappings were repeated iteratively, each time using the marker with the highest LOD score as a cofactor until no significant QTL were detected. The annotate_lods function was used to calculate the percent of variance in RIAIL phenotypes explained by each QTL and a 95% confidence interval around each peak marker, defined by any marker on the same chromosome within a 1.5-LOD drop from the peak marker.",

For each NIL, eight single-parent crosses were performed, followed by six generations of propagating isogenic lines to ensure homozygosity of the genome.

The summary of each scantwo output includes the maximum interactive LOD score for each pair of chromosomes. To determine a threshold for significant interactions, we performed 1000 permutations of the scantwo analysis and selected the 95th percentile from these permutations. For the bleomycin-response variation scantwo, the significant interaction threshold was a LOD score of 4.08. The significant interaction threshold for the scb-1 expression variation scantwo was 4.05. The bleomycin-response variation scantwo summary is available as File S8, and the scantwo summary for scb-1 expression variation is available as File S17.",

Our initial linkage mappings used the 1454 marker set (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009) and had a QTL confidence interval larger than the interval found using the whole-genome marker set (described above). Because this confidence interval was larger and more conservative, we kept it for subsequent testing of candidate genes. This expanded interval contained an additional 20 kb on either side of the whole-genome marker set confidence interval (File S9). The snpeff function within the cegwas R package was used to identify variants within the region of interest (File S11). We identified variants predicted to have MODERATE (coding variant, inframe insertion/deletion, missense variant, regulatory region ablation, or splice region variant) or HIGH (chromosome number variant, exon loss, frameshift variant, rare amino acid variant, splice donor/acceptor variant, start loss, stop loss/gain, or transcript ablation) phenotypic effects according to Sequence Ontology (Eilbeck et al. 2005) and selected variants at which the CB4856 strain contains the alternate allele. This search found five candidate genes in the interval: C45B11.8, C45B11.6, jmjd-5, srg-42, and cnc-10, which each contain one nonsynonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains.",

The N2 and CB4856 L4 hermaphrodite larvae were picked to 6 cm agar plates seeded with OP50\nEscherichia coli 24 hr before injection. The CRISPR injection mix was assembled by first incubating 0.88 \u00b5l of 200 \u00b5M AltR CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA (IDT, catalog no. 1072532), 0.82 \u00b5l of each of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 AltR CRISPR-Cas9 crRNAs at a stock concentration of 100 \u00b5M in Duplex Buffer (IDT), and 0.12 \u00b5l of 100 \u00b5M dpy-10 co-injection crRNA at 95\u00b0 for 5 min. Then, 2.52 \u00b5l of 69 \u00b5M AltR S. pyogenes Cas9 Nuclease (catalog no. 1081058; IDT) was added to the tracrRNA/crRNA complex mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Finally, 0.5 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M dpy-10 repair construct and distilled water were added to a final volume of 10 \u00b5l. The injection mixture was loaded into the injection capillary using a mouth pipet to avoid bubbles in the injection solution. Young adult animals were mounted onto agar injection pads, injected in either the anterior or posterior arm of the gonad, and allowed to recover on 6 cm plates in bulk. At 12 hr after injection, survivors were transferred to individual 6 cm plates. Broods with successful edits were easily observed because of the dpy-10 co-injection marker, which created animals with an obvious locomotive defect, roller (Rol), or morphological phenotype, dumpy (Dpy). At 3\u20134 days after injections, plates were checked for the presence of Rol or Dpy F1 progeny. These Rol F1 progeny were transferred to individual 6 cm plates, allowed to lay offspring, and genotyped for the desired edit 24 hr later. Genotyping was performed with PCR amplicons designed around the desired site of the deletion. Plates with heterozygous or homozygous deletions were propagated and genotyped for at least two more generations to ensure homozygosity, and to cross out the Rol mutation. Deletion amplicons were Sanger sequenced to identify the exact location of the deletion. Reagents used to generate deletion alleles are detailed in Supplemental Information.",

Two repair constructs were designed, one for the N2 to CB4856 replacement and vice versa. Repair oligonucleotides were homologous to the background strain except for the nucleotide variant, a silent mutation in the PAM site (A339A) to eliminate repair construct cleavage and a silent mutation that introduces a BsaAI restriction enzyme cut site (T336T). Repair constructs contained a 35-bp homology arm on the PAM-proximal side of the edit, and a 91-bp homology arm on the PAM-distal side of the edit.

For each heterozygous/hemizygous genotype, 30 hermaphrodites and 60 males were placed onto each of four 6-cm plates and allowed to mate for 48 hr. The same process was completed for homozygous strains to remove biases introduced by the presence of male progeny in the assay. Mated hermaphrodites were transferred to a clean 6-cm plate and allowed to lay embryos for 8 hr. After the egg laying period, adults were manually removed from egg lay plates, and embryos were washed into 15 ml conical tubes using M9 and a combination of Pasteur pipette rinsing and scraping with plastic inoculation loops.

Therefore, exposure to bleomycin can affect the development of C. elegans larvae as well as germ-cell production of adult animals. We used a HTA to measure the effects of bleomycin on development and brood size (Figure S1, Materials and Methods). To determine the concentration of bleomycin that would maximize among-strain, while minimizing within-strain, phenotypic variation, we used the HTA to perform a dose-response assay. We assessed bleomycin responses for four divergent strains (N2, CB4856, JU258, and DL238) across each of 26 HTA traits (Figure S2 and File S1). For each concentration of bleomycin, we calculated the broad-sense heritability of the traits (Materials and Methods), and found that heritability was maximized at 50 \u00b5M bleomycin (mean H2 across all traits = 0.58, File S2). Given these results, we exposed animals to 50 \u00b5M bleomycin for all future HTA experiments.",

RIAILs were previously constructed between these two strains (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009; Andersen et al. 2015), and these RIAILs have been leveraged to identify genetic variants that cause phenotypic differences between the N2 and CB4856 strains (Kammenga et al. 2007; Palopoli et al. 2008; Seidel et al. 2008, 2011; McGrath et al. 2009; Reddy et al. 2009; Bendesky et al. 2011, 2012; Andersen et al. 2014; Schmid et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2017; Zdraljevic et al. 2017). We used these RIAILs to identify genetic variants that contribute to differential bleomycin responses between the N2 and CB4856 strains. Using our HTA, we measured each of the 26 fitness parameters for 249 RIAILs (Materials and Methods, File S3). Correlations between each pairwise combination of the 26 HTA measurements revealed several clusters of highly correlated traits (Figure S3). Therefore, the summary statistics measured by the BIOSORT should not be considered independent traits for linkage mapping. We selected median optical density (median.EXT) for future analyses, which is related to both animal length and optical extinction, because this trait was highly correlated with many of the 26 HTA traits and was highly heritable (H2 = 0.73, File S2).",

We used the HTA to test these strains in response to bleomycin (File S3). The NIL with the N2 genotype across this QTL introgressed into the CB4856 background (ECA230) was statistically more sensitive to bleomycin than CB4856 (Figure S6 and File S7, P = 1.3e\u221214, Tukey HSD). This phenotype indicated that the N2 genotype within the introgressed region (which includes the QTL confidence interval) confers sensitivity to bleomycin. However, the reciprocal NIL with the CB4856 locus introgressed into the N2 background (ECA232) had a bleomycin-response phenotype that was not significantly different from the N2 strain (Figure S6 and File S7, P = 0.053, Tukey HSD), suggesting that interacting loci could underlie bleomycin responses in a background-dependent manner. We performed a two-factor genome scan to map potential epistatic loci but did not identify a significant interaction between the QTL on chromosome V and other loci (Figure S7 and File S8). However, the failure to detect significant interacting QTL could be because we have too few recombinant strains or because too few replicates of each RIAIL were phenotyped. Alternatively, more than two loci might underlie the transgressive phenotype of ECA230, and a two-factor genome scan might not be able to capture this complexity.",

In addition, the N2 region on the left of chromosome V was removed from both NIL strains to ensure that this region of introgression did not underlie the phenotypic difference between ECA230 and CB4856. The genotypes of ECA411 and ECA528 differ in a small region of chromosome V that includes the QTL confidence interval (Figure 2 and Files S5 and S6). Both of these strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than the background parental strain, CB4856. This result could suggest that the introgressed region shared between these strains, which does not include the QTL, conferred some bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains (Figure 2). Alternatively, the hypersensitivity of these NILs could suggest the presence of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities between the N2 and CB4856 genotypes (Snoek et al. 2014) that might affect stress responses of the NILs. However, ECA528 was much more sensitive to bleomycin than ECA411 (Figure 2 and File S7). Because ECA528 has the N2 genotype across the QTL region and ECA411 has the CB4856 genotype, these results suggest that the QTL genotype strongly affects bleomycin sensitivity (Figure 2, ECA528 vs. each other strain P < 1e\u221214, Tukey HSD).

We tested the bleomycin response of each deletion allele in comparison to the N2 and CB4856 parental strains (Figure 3B and File S3). The deletion alleles of C45B11.8, C45B11.6, srg-42, and cnc-10 each had a bleomycin response similar to the respective parent genetic background, which suggested that the functions of each of these genes did not affect bleomycin responses (Figure 3B and File S7, P > 0.05, Tukey HSD). By contrast, the jmjd-5 deletion alleles in the N2 and the CB4856 backgrounds were each more resistant to bleomycin than their respective parental strains (Figure 3B and File S7, ECA1047 vs.\nCB4856\nP = 3.8e\u221210, ECA1048 vs.\nCB4856\nP = 0.026, ECA1051 vs.\nN2\nP = 7.4e\u22124, ECA1052 vs.\nN2\nP = 2.9e\u22126, Tukey HSD). However, we also noted that these strains were more sensitive in the control condition than other deletion strains (Figure S8 and Files S1 and S7).

At residue 338 of JMJD-5, the N2 strain has a proline, whereas the CB4856 strain has a serine (P338S, Figure S9A). We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate reciprocal allele replacements of the jmjd-5 single-nucleotide polymorphism that encodes the putative amino-acid change in the N2 background jmjd-5(N2 to CB4856) and in the CB4856 background jmjd-5(CB4856 to N2) (Materials and Methods, Supplemental Information). We created two independent allele replacements in each genetic background and measured each strain for bleomycin-response differences as compared to the parental strains (Figure S9B and File S3). Although the allele-replacement strains with the CB4856 allele in the N2 genetic background jmjd-5(N2 to CB4856) were significantly different from the N2 parental strain, these strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than N2 (Figure S9B and File S7, ECA576 vs.\nN2\nP = 0.006, ECA577 vs.\nN2\nP = 1.6e\u22126, Tukey HSD). This increased sensitivity was unexpected, because the CB4856 allele at the jmjd-5 locus should confer resistance. However, the NIL with the CB4856 genotype across the QTL was not different from the N2 parental strain (ECA232 in Figure S6 and File S7), suggesting that the QTL might confer increased sensitivity only when the N2 allele is in the CB4856 background. Therefore, it remained unclear whether an allele replacement of jmjd-5 in the N2 parental background could confer resistance. Neither of the two strains with the N2 allele in the CB4856 background, jmjd-5(CB4856 to N2), conferred a significantly more sensitive phenotype than the CB4856 parental strain (Figure S9B and File S7). Given that the QTL explained 43.58% of phenotypic variation among the RIAILs, the causal variant should have a clear impact on bleomycin response. Additionally, the NILs with the N2 allele at the QTL introgressed into the CB4856 background displayed a significant increase in bleomycin sensitivity compared to the parental CB4856 strain (Figure S6 and File S7). Taken together, the phenotypes of the reciprocal allele-replacement strains showed that the amino-acid change in JMJD-5 likely does not underlie bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains, although deletion of this gene did cause resistance to bleomycin regardless of the genetic background. We performed a reciprocal hemizygosity assay to test if natural variation in jmjd-5 function affected bleomycin responses (Figures S10\u2013S12). The results of this assay supported the previously identified increase in bleomycin resistance of homozygous jmjd-5 deletions in both parental backgrounds (Figure S11 and File S7, P < 0.05, Tukey HSD), which again might be caused by an increased sensitivity in the control condition (Figure S12). However, the increases in bleomycin resistance between each jmjd-5 deletion strain and the strain with the same genetic background were similar, and the reciprocal hemizygous strains show equivalent bleomycin responses (Figure S11). Taken together, these results suggest that natural variation in jmjd-5 function does not underlie this QTL.",

Of the 118 genes in the 187 kb surrounding the bleomycin-response QTL, expression for 50 genes were measured in the previous microarray study. We identified a significant eQTL for 8 of these 50 genes, 4 of which mapped to chromosome V (File S13). eQTL for two of those four genes, H19N07.3 and cnc-10, mapped to the center of chromosome V, and overlapped with the bleomycin-response QTL. Because cnc-10 did not underlie bleomycin response variation (Figure 3B), we hypothesized that H19N07.3 might underlie the bleomycin-response QTL. The H19N07.3 eQTL explains 45.70% of the variation in H19N07.3 expression among the RIAILs (Figure 4, A and B and File S14). The length of animals and expression of H19N07.3 was correlated in the RIAIL strains (Figure 4C and File S15, r2 = 0.61, P < 9.5e\u221213 Spearman\u2019s correlation).

RIAILs with the CB4856 allele at the QTL peak marker have increased expression of scb-1 and increased bleomycin resistance compared to RIAILs with the N2 allele (Figure 1 and Figure 4). Therefore, scb-1 expression differences might cause the bleomycin-response variation between the parental strains. We performed RNA-seq of the N2 and CB4856 strains to assess scb-1 expression differences between the parental strains, and did not identify a significant increase in expression in the CB4856 strain (Figure S13 and File S16, P = 0.20, Wald test; P = 0.17, likelihood ratio test). This result could be caused by the low sample size (n = 3) in the RNA-seq experiment, or the RIAIL strains could have a novel variant that arose during strain construction that causes scb-1 expression variation. Alternatively, the expression difference observed in the RIAIL strains could be attributed to epistatic loci. We performed a two-factor genome scan to identify epistatic loci that underlie scb-1 expression variation in the RIAILs and identified two significant interactions: one between loci on chromosomes IV and X, and another between loci on chromosomes II and V (Figure S14 and File S17). This result might suggest that epistatic loci underlie scb-1 expression variation in the RIAILs and could explain why scb-1 expression is not variable in the parental strains.",

Because bleomycin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and introduces oxidative stress to cells (Stubbe and Kozarich 1987), reduction of scb-1 function might inhibit the ability of an animal to respond to bleomycin. This model is in agreement with our observation that scb-1 deletions and RIAILs with lower scb-1 expression are sensitive to bleomycin (Figure 4 and Figure 5). We used the amino acid sequence of SCB-1 to query the Phyre2 database, and found weak homology to a viral hydrolase (Kelley et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2018). This result could suggest that SCB-1 might function as a hydrolase, which could be the mechanism by which scb-1 regulates cellular stress. This finding would be similar to clinical studies that have suggested a role for BLMH in bleomycin-response variation (Lazo and Humphreys 1983; Nuver et al. 2005; de Haas et al. 2008; Gu et al. 2011; Alt\u00e9s et al. 2013). Because scb-1 is expressed in the nucleus of all somatic cells, this gene might impact the ability of bleomycin to cause DNA damage within the cell nucleus (Turek et al. 2016). Alternatively, scb-1 could impact bleomycin import, export, or another mechanism. If the mechanism of scb-1 is conserved in humans, this discovery could offer insights into the clinical applications of bleomycin. Our results also suggested the presence of genes that interact with scb-1 to cause bleomycin-response differences. These interacting genes could be conserved in humans and inform the use of bleomycin in the clinic.",

            "text": "Despite its lack of conservation in humans, the SCB-1 protein is homologous to other proteins in nematode species. Bleomycin is produced by the soil bacterium, Streptomyces verticillus (Calcutt and Schmidt 1994; Du et al. 2000; Shen et al. 2002), which might be found in association with nematodes such as C. elegans in the wild (Samuel et al. 2016). A shared niche between C. elegans and S. verticillus could cause bleomycin resistance to be selected. Additionally, the CB4856 wild isolate is more resistant to bleomycin than the laboratory-adapted strain, N2. In fact, the N2 strain is the most sensitive to bleomycin across all strains tested in our HTA (Figure S16), which could indicate that bleomycin resistance is beneficial for wild isolates. Given its potential role in the highly conserved insulin-like pathway, scb-1 could be beneficial in responses to multiple toxins. Interestingly, the scb-1 gene lies within a toxin-response QTL hotspot on chromosome V (Evans et al. 2018). Understanding the mechanism of the role of scb-1 in toxin responses might offer insights into evolutionary processes that shaped the genomic diversity of C. elegans and other nematode species.",

In each of these studies, drug-response QTL overlap between linkage mapping and GWA, and variants in common between both mapping strain sets have been shown to underlie drug-response QTL. In the case of the bleomycin response, the linkage-mapping QTL did not overlap with the QTL identified through GWA. Therefore, the variant that underlies the QTL likely is not present at an allele frequency above 5% in the panel of wild isolates used for the bleomycin GWA. The difference between linkage mapping and GWA results indicates that both rare and common natural variants underlie bleomycin-response variation.",

Although linkage mapping detected a highly significant QTL, the manner in which genetic components affect bleomycin responses is not simple. Certain NILs showed transgressive phenotypes (Figure 2 and Figure S6), which indicates that multiple loci interact to create extreme bleomycin sensitivity in particular strains with mixed genetic backgrounds. Our attempts to identify epistatic loci that underlie bleomycin responses in the RIAILs were unsuccessful, potentially because of the complexity of these epistatic interactions. Despite this complexity, scb-1 deletions showed increased bleomycin sensitivity in both parental backgrounds, and expression variation among the RIAIL panel mapped to the same locus as the bleomycin response QTL. Interestingly, the parental strains do not seem to vary in scb-1 expression, as measured by RNA-seq (Figure S13). We found evidence of epistatic loci that underlie scb-1 expression variation in the RIAILs, which might explain why the parental strains do not differ in scb-1 expression (Figure S14). Additional complexities of this trait include the lack of overlap between GWA and linkage mapping QTL, and the potential effect of jmjd-5 loss-of-function on bleomycin responses. Despite the complicated manner in which genetic variants seem to affect bleomycin responses, we leveraged the powerful model of C. elegans to identify a single gene that underlies this complex trait.",
