            "text": "Gill-associated virus (GAV) infects Penaeus monodon shrimp and is the type species of the genus Okavirus in the Roniviridae, the only currently known invertebrate nidoviruses. In all other nidoviruses, the nucleocapsid (N) protein is encoded by a gene located near to the genome 3\u2032-terminus and downstream of genes encoding other virion structural proteins [1]. However, in GAV and other genotypic variants in the yellow head virus (YHV) complex, the N protein is encoded in the ORF2 gene which resides immediately downstream of the 20 kb 5\u2032-terminal ORF1a/1b replicase gene [2], [3]. The deduced molecular masses of the 144\u2013146 amino acid (aa) N proteins of GAV and YHV (16.0\u201316.3 kDa) are lower than those estimated by SDS-PAGE (20\u201322 kDa), which for YHV has been reported to be due to a C-terminal cluster of acidic residues [3], [4]. Immuno-electron microscopy has confirmed that the N protein is the primary structural protein component of okavirus nucleocapsids [2], [5].",

Nonetheless, the N proteins of GAV and YHV share common antigenic sites as evidenced by their cross-reactivity for a YHV N protein monoclonal antibody [5], [7] and polyclonal antiserum to a synthetic peptide designed to a C-terminal sequence of the GAV N protein [2]. As with the N proteins of coronaviruses and toroviruses [8], [9], the N proteins of GAV and YHV lack cysteine residues and are highly basic [2], [3]. It also possesses proline-rich and basic residue-rich domains likely to facilitate RNA binding as hypothesized for similar sequences in the N protein of toroviruses [2], [10]. The N protein length in okaviruses is intermediate to the corresponding proteins of arteriviruses (110\u2013128 aa) and toroviruses (160\u2013167 aa), and much shorter than the N protein of coronaviruses (377\u2013454 aa) [2], [11], [12], [13], [14].",

Except for QE10-N14, all His6-tagged proteins were detected and were estimated to be >90% pure, with single bands detected for all but QE10-N1 and QE10-N38 by both methods. The QE10-N1 protein preparation contained additional minor bands of \u223c22 kDa and \u223c29 kDa. The QE10-N38 preparation contained a minor band (\u223c28 kDa) about twice the size of the primary protein suggesting that it might be a protein dimer rather than a contaminant. The reason why the recombinant QE10-N14 protein with a 61 aa N-terminal truncation failed to bind the Ni2+-HRP probe following SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane is not known, but possibly it was due to some refolding of the protein that rendered the N-terminal His6-tag inaccessible [19]. Yields of the purified proteins were estimated to be in the order of 10\u201330 \u00b5g/ml of bacterial culture. Moreover, the identity of each recombinant N protein was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses of peptides generated following tryptic digestion (data not shown).",

Purified full-length GAV N protein bound readily to synthetic (+) and (\u2212) sense ssRNAs prepared to various GAV genome regions. The N protein also bound to a (+) sense ssRNA prepared to the M RNA segment of Mourilyan virus (MoV), a shrimp bunya-like virus, to dsRNAs prepared from (+) and (\u2212) sense GAV ssRNAs, and to genomic ssDNA of bacteriophage M13 but not to dsDNA amplified by RT-PCR from two GAV genome regions. The ability to bind RNA was expected due to the structural role of the N protein in okavirus nucleocapsids [2], [3], [5], [20]. The fact that RNAs were bound irrespective of their sequence or polarity indicates that specific nucleation sequences, RNA folding structures or other factors might be needed to direct the GAV N protein to encapsidate genomic (+) ssRNA, as with the N proteins of many viruses, including coronaviruses [8], [21], which share the ability to bind RNA in non-sequence specific manner. This may be due to the basic charge properties of these N proteins. As the GAV N protein possesses more basic amino acids (20/144 = 13.9%, pI 9.84) than acidic amino acids (13/144 = 9.0%) [2], its net positive charge is likely to promote association with polyanions such as RNA soon after its synthesis. However, the processes directing specific binding of okavirus N protein to genomic RNA to form nucleocapsids in the potential presence of other RNAs also capable of binding clearly need to be investigated further, and experiments to examine this would be assisted greatly by shrimp cell culture systems capable supporting virus replication becoming available.",

EMSA data generated using three different ssRNAs reacted with these truncated GAV N protein constructs localized the RNA binding domain to a 50 aa N-terminal sequence spanning Met11\u2013Arg60. In this region, the GAV N protein sequence is quite basic (theoretical pI = 11.72) due to the presence of eight positively-charged residues and only two negatively-charged residues. Database searches undertaken using the InterProscan program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/) [23] were unable to identify sequences close in similarity to other better characterized RNA-binding or RNA-recognition motifs. However, some general sequence similarities, mainly relating to the relatively high proportion of arginine residues, were noted with the short arginine-rich motifs (ARMs) that mediate RNA binding of the Rev and Tat proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [24], and of the anti-terminator N protein of bacteriophages \u03d521 and P22 [25].(\nTable 1\n)",

Proline-rich protein sequences are known to primarily form helices rather than \u03b2-sheets, and in the p33 replicase protein of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), for example, an arginine/proline-rich RPRRRP motif has been shown to bind ssRNA in preference to dsRNA or dsDNA [26]. However, as the N protein peptide displayed little obvious binding preference for ssRNA compared to dsDNA, additional analyses using variant peptide sequences will be needed to identify which amino acids are responsible for conferring this broad nucleic acid binding capability.",

However, during the encapsidation process, association of the viral membrane (M) protein confers selective binding of genomic-length (+) ssRNA directed by a 190 nt packaging signal positioned toward the 3\u2032-end of the ORF1b gene [27]. In a preliminary attempt to identify an RNA packaging signal in the GAV genome, EMSAs were performed using ssRNAs synthesized to various genome regions including (i) an ORF1b gene 3\u2032-region spanning the relative position to the genome packaging signal identified in MHV [28], (ii) a 3\u2032-terminal genome region corresponding in position to the region in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genome reported to contain an RNA binding domain [29] and (iii) the 5\u2032-genomic RNA terminus which, in coronaviruses, has also been reported to interact specifically with N protein [30]. However, recombinant GAV N protein bound all synthetic ssRNAs tested and whilst it is possible that its binding affinity and/or interaction kinetics varied amongst the RNAs, these could not be quantified using the EMSA method. Thus, based on this uniformity of binding, other experimental approaches will be needed to identify what sequence, if any, in the GAV genome acts as a packaging signal or confers specificity for N protein binding. As in MHV, the identification of such RNA packaging signals will likely require establishment of cell culture systems to allow the characterization of sequences of mutant defective-interfering genomic RNAs packaged into virions [28], [31].",

Based on molar ratios examined using a 626 nt ssRNA, migration was visibly retarded more when the estimated molar N protein:ssRNA ratio was increased from 20\u22361 to 30\u22361, and whilst no additional retardation was evident at a ratio of 50\u22361, it increased again at a ratio of 100\u22361. This apparent biphasic N protein ssRNA interaction suggests that there is some point at which N protein binding becomes saturated, but once present in vast excess, either more than one complex type can form or unit complexes aggregate. A similar phenomenon occurs in prunus necrotic ringspot virus, a plant ilarvirus containing a tripartite (+)ssRNA genome, in which two different complex types can form in a non-sequence-specific manner between the 32 kDa movement protein (MP) and ssRNA4 [32]. One ssRNA complex forming in the presence of high MP amounts (MP:ssRNA molar ratio 400\u22361) was observed to enter an EMSA gel, whereas another complex type that formed at a lower molar ratio (120\u22361) did not. Moreover, urea denaturation had little in any effect on the type of ssRNA:MP complex formed at higher MP amounts but disaggregated the complex type formed in lower MP amounts, suggested that the latter might comprise rod-like structures restricting gel entry and that excess MP might promote increased protein-protein interactions resulted in a more compact globular ssRNA-MP complex capable of entering the gel matrix [32]. Although something similar might be the reason for the biphasic interaction of the GAV N protein with ssRNA, delineation of the nature of the various complexes that can form will require further investigation.",
