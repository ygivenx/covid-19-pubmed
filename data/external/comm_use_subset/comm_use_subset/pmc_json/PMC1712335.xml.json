Performance measures may detect changes in physical function that self-report measures do not. Using the WOMAC physical function subscale, SF-36 physical function and role-physical subscales, stair ascent cycle duration, gait speed over 10 meters and the six-minute walk test, Parent and Moffet [7] assessed patients after TKA, preoperatively and at 2 and 4 months postoperatively. At 2 months, the WOMAC physical function subscale and SF-36 physical function domain demonstrated significant improvement compared to patients' preoperative values whereas the locomotor tests were comparable to their preoperative values or significantly less (six-minute walk distance). Previous studies by the authors have similarly noted that the physical function subscale of the WOMAC has failed to detect changes in physical function that were evident with performance assessment [13,14]. The results of these studies suggest that self-report measures comment more on a patient's experience of moving around whereas performance specific measures may better represent the ability to move around.",

Because of the paucity of longitudinal studies evaluating the early time course of physical functional change at frequent intervals, the purpose of the current study was to characterize early recovery using a combination of self-report and physical performance measures in patients following THA and TKA. The analytic approach of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was chosen as it provides a flexible technique for dealing with longitudinal data [17,18]. Using HLM, the specific purposes of the study were to model recovery curves for the Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS), the physical function subscale of the WOMAC (WOMAC PF), the 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), the timed up and go test (TUG) and a timed stair test (ST) and to compare differences in their patterns of recovery. The models provide the scores and rate of change of the scores for the outcome measure of interest. Clinicians, researchers, and perhaps even health policy makers, can apply this information to make decisions concerning the optimal assessment intervals and to predict recovery post arthroplasty.",

Patients following THA were educated about postoperative movement restrictions such as the avoidance of hip flexion beyond 90 degrees, hip adduction beyond neutral and excessive hip rotation for the first 6\u20138 weeks. Hip range of motion, and strengthening exercises were initiated along with functional training. At the time of this study, 66% of the patients post THA had weight bearing restrictions.

A more detailed examination of the findings with respect to the predictor variables is published elsewhere [39]. In most models, the only significant random effect was the intercept indicating that individuals varied in their starting points one week after surgery; however, their slopes and quadratic component of time were similar. The LEFS model was the exception with both the intercept and slope significant. To understand how the standard deviations of the intercepts give an indication of between-patient differences in functioning, consider the results for the 6 MWT reported in Table 4. The mean distance at 1 week is 142.43, but the standard deviation of the intercepts is estimated to be 53.70. According to the standard model assumptions, about two thirds of patients are expected to have scores +/- 1 SD from the mean. Therefore, the variations in 6 MWT are such that about two thirds of patients' 1-week scores are expected to be in the range of 88.7 to 196.1 meters. Since these estimates are from the final multivariate model, this suggests that large variations in short-term post operative function remain, even after accounting for the available clinical predictors.",

Therefore, if an individual had a baseline score which exceeded another by 100 meters, this would translate into 36 more meters at 10 weeks postoperatively. In the five models, slowing in the recovery trajectory occurred over time and in all models, a second-degree polynomial growth term (quadratic-weeks squared) provided a reasonable fit for the data over the study interval.",

A significant interaction with site of arthroplasty and weeks after surgery was also apparent in each of the 6 MWT, TUG and ST models. Although patients undergoing THA started postoperatively with worse function, their rate of recovery was faster than their knee counterparts with respect to each of the performance measures. In contrast, the growth curves for the LEFS and physical function subscale of the WOMAC were not significantly different following THA and TKA. In the graphs (Figures 1, 2, 3), the patients post THA catch and surpass those following TKA around 9 to 10 weeks. This is likely a reflection of the cessation of the early postoperative hip restrictions beginning at 6 weeks. Another contributing factor would have been the postoperative weight bearing status of the patients following THA with a significant proportion of the patients progressing from restricted to full weight bearing at the 6 week mark.",

The predicted scores for the WOMAC physical function subscale met the preoperative scores at one to two weeks (Figure 4) and the preoperative LEFS scores were met around 3 weeks (Figure 5). In contrast the preoperative 6 MWT distances were met between 7 \u2013 8 weeks, the TUG between 6 \u2013 8 weeks and the ST around 8 to 10 weeks. It would appear that the WOMAC physical function subscale is not reflecting the early deterioration that occurs in physical function. Consistent with findings from an earlier study [14], the LEFS did reflect some of the early deterioration. Walker et al [41]reported a similar finding when comparing measured ambulatory activity to self-reported data in patients post TKR. Their results indicated that self-reported mobility improved before the subjects were actually doing more. Other authors have noted similar findings [7,24,26]. It has been suggested that physical performance measures of functioning may confer advantages over self-report measures in the evaluation of change [42,43].",

The predicted growth curves for the TUG confirm its usefulness only in the early recovery period after arthroplasty. Around 9 to 10 weeks there is a ceiling effect. At this time, both the THR and TKR groups having passed the benchmark of 10 seconds which has been documented to be the level at which patients are functionally independent [36]. Reference TUG scores for community-dwelling elderly people with independent functioning further confirm this finding [44]. The mean TUG score has been reported to be 8 seconds for the age group 60 to 69 and 9 seconds for 70 to 79 year olds [44]. Mizner et al [24] similarly found no change in TUG scores between 3 and 6 months in a group of patients who underwent TKA followed by rehabilitation. As noted in the results, the TUG is a measure that most patients can complete at discharge from hospital and can be of benefit to clinicians administering treatment in the early postoperative period. In contrast, the 6 MWT and ST would not be the best measures for the early postoperative period as in this study between 26\u201333% of patients could not complete them at discharge. With the exception of the TUG measure, further study will be required to examine the recovery curves of the 6 MWT and ST to determine how much further improvement in function is obtained and to determine when patients have reached the stage of most benefit from surgery.",

It was planned that patients would have a minimum of 2 visits but preferably 3 in the first 4 months, although the scheduled times were not to be standardized. The fact that more than 50% of the subjects had only two measurements could have impacted the modeling of the quadratic time component as three time points are required. An important advantage of hierarchical linear modeling, however, is that the number and timing of observations need not be the same across all subjects [17,47]. In the case of the patients who had limited data, the mixed effects models would stabilize their estimates by anchoring them to the group average. However, bias will still result if the cause of the missingness is related to the outcome that would have been observed. For example, this could have been a problem in the case of the 26% of patients who were unable to complete the ST at their discharge from the hospital. As noted in the results, this group of patients was slower than their counterparts preoperatively and they may have deferred testing due to their postoperative acuity. As a result, had they been tested they might have contributed slower ST times and the absence of their scores could have led to overestimation of the growth curves at the one-two week mark. This may have also been the case with the 6 MWT predicted scores corresponding to the discharge assessment.",
