            "text": "Macrocyclic peptides constitute a significant portion of macrocyclic drugs on the market today and are used in many fields ranging from infectious disease to oncology [1,2]. Recently, reports of antibacterial macrocyclic peptide natural products have demonstrated that macrocyclic peptides are privileged scaffolds for drug development [3]. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has been cautious with developing macrocyclic drugs because of concerns of higher cost and synthetic challenges associated with lead optimization and scale-up campaigns [1]. Head-to-tail cyclization of linear peptides of three to eight amino acids can be challenging, particularly for peptides containing exclusively the L-configuration [4]. The formation of linear as well as cyclic dimers and oligomers during the cyclization step can compete with head-to-tail cyclization [5]. Additionally, epimerization of the C-terminal amino acid is commonly encountered during the C-terminal activation step before the cyclization reaction takes place. To date, significant progress has been made in the synthesis of macrocycles, making their efficient construction more feasible [1]. A common strategy to improve head-to-tail cyclization of small peptides involves the incorporation of the \u201cturn-inducing\u201d functionality into a linear peptide sequence such as glycine, proline, pseudoproline, N-alkyl, or D-amino acid residue [4,6,7,8]. In the case of the pseudoproline method, a pseudoproline residue, synthesized by the condensation of serine, threonine, or cysteine with an aldehyde or ketone, is incorporated into the peptide sequence pre-cyclization. The pseudoproline residue can then be deprotected post cyclization [6,7]. Coupling reagents in the azabenzotriazole class are the most commonly employed for cyclization of linear peptide precursors, as they give faster rates of cyclization with lower amounts of epimerization, typically less than 10% [4]. Moreover, linear peptides with the D-configuration at their C-terminal residue have favorable cyclization kinetics [4]. This may be a result of less steric hindrance during the formation of the peptide bond occurring between the D- and L-amino acids, particularly when bulky side chains are present. Cyclodepsipeptides, with one ester linkage in the macrocyclic backbone [9], have been utilized in the epimerization-free synthesis of cyclopeptides by employing a key O-N-acyl migration reaction at a serine residue [10,11].

Moreover, peptide macrocyclization is a way of locking the peptide sequence in a \u03b2-strand conformation [15,16], a conformation often recognized by their enzyme targets, such as proteases [15,16,21]. Macrocycles are not completely rigid but still have a degree of flexibility, which facilitates interactions with their receptors [1]. Additionally, the entropic cost of receptor binding may be reduced for macrocyclic drugs compared to their linear equivalents as a result of conformational pre-organization [1]. N-Methylation of the cyclic peptide backbone has been shown in some cases to improve peptide metabolic stability [14,22] and oral bioavailability [23] as a result of changes in peptide conformation or steric hindrance [22]. The immunosuppressant drug ciclosporin is a macrocyclic undecapeptide bearing seven N-methylated motifs and can be administered as an oral formulation [1,22]. Modification of the cyclohexapeptide backbone to form cyclohexapeptoids can, in some cases, lead to an increase to cell permeability [24]. Most cyclic peptide drugs on the market today are administered parenterally, and only few are orally bioavailable [1], highlighting an ongoing challenge. For this reason, the synthesis and evaluation of novel cyclopeptide scaffolds to expand our understanding of their pharmacokinetic (PK) properties is still at the forefront of many research programs [2,12,23].

The solid-supported methodology allows excess reagents to be removed after each step by employing a simple filtration, and the final desired product is obtained after cleavage from the resin [25].

            "text": "Peptide-based therapeutics are notorious for their poor oral bioavailability profiles and low plasma stability, which have limited their use as orally delivered drugs. Although N-methylation of cyclohexapeptides was shown to improve oral bioavailability [23], Hill et al. demonstrated that cyclohexaleucine peptides 9 and 10 without N-methylation functionality showed some degree of oral bioavailability: 17% and 9%, respectively [12]. Interestingly, the epimer 10 showed ~2-fold lower oral bioavailability than 9 as a result of its notably higher plasma clearance rate (24.1 versus 4.7 mL/min/kg). The reason was suggested to be caused by differences in solvent exposure to the peptide backbone resulting from the conformational change at a Leu residue. Membrane permeability was measured using RRCK and CACO-2 cell monolayers, the former having a lack of active transporters. In the RRCK assay, compounds 9 and 10 showed 2\u20133-fold greater membrane permeability than the control standard cyclosporin A (CsA). In the CACO-2 assay, 9 and 10 showed similar permeability to CsA (Papp \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm\u00b7s\u22121) [12]. As shown in Scheme 3, the cyclohexaleucine peptide 9 was synthesized using SPPS on 2-CTC resin as a linear hexapeptide precursor, followed by cleavage from resin and solution-phase cyclization under dilute conditions. Epimer 10 was formed during the final cyclization step but could be successfully separated out during purification using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The observed epimerization was due to a well-known epimerization process that takes place during the carboxylic acid activation step prior to cyclization [31,32]. In this example, the epimer ratio of 9 and 10 was 85:15 [12].",

The producing organisms are commonly fungi, such as Hamigera avellanea [34], Acremonium [35] or Penicillium [36] species. Of particular interest is the high degree of D-amino acid incorporation (D-Ala, D-Aba, D-allo-Ile, and D-Val) within the macrocyclic scaffold. These natural products also contain non-proteinogenic anthranilic acid (Ant) and L-pipecolinic acid (Pip) residues, suggesting that a non-ribosomal biosynthetic pathway may have been used by the producing organisms. The enhanced bioavailability of these natural products can be attributed to improved cell permeability (via passive diffusion) and higher metabolic stability due to their cyclic nature and incorporation of D-amino acids [33]. The synthesis of 11\u201314 was achieved via the initial construction of linear hexapeptides by SPPS using a trityl alcohol SynPhase Lantern solid support. A representative synthesis for the construction of cyclohexapeptide 11 is shown in Scheme 4. The SPPS started by attaching Fmoc-D-Ala-OH for 11\u201313 or Fmoc-D-Aba-OH for 14, as this allowed the final solution-phase HBTU-mediated macrocyclization step to proceed with the least amount of steric hindrance [33]. The N-methyl-Leu, L-pipecolinic acid, and anthranilic acid functionality seen in 11-14 was incorporated into the peptide sequence employing Fmoc-L-MeLeu-OH, Fmoc-L-Pip-OH or Fmoc-Ant-OH during SPPS, respectively. When coupling to the weakly nucleophilic amino function of the N-terminal anthranilic acid residue, the Fmoc-amino acid chloride of D-allo-Ile or D-Val was generated in situ using triphosgene prior to coupling [33]. The linear hexapeptides were cleaved from the resin using 30% hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) in dichloromethane (DCM) and cyclized in solution using 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in DCM at room temperature for 3 h to afford 11\u201314. The natural products 11\u201314 were tested in a fourth-instar larvae assay and were all found to have paralytic activity against silkworm larvae. The stereochemistry of the D-Ala side chain was found to be crucial for paralytic activity, as side-chain epimers of 11 and 12 having L-Ala in place of D-Ala showed little activity. ",

The study was prompted by earlier reports of cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 natural products, aerucyclamides A\u2013D (Figure 4), which displayed promising micromolar IC50 (50% of maximal inhibitory concentration) values against a K1 chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum [38,39]. The SPPS of linear hexapeptide precursors was conducted using 2-CTC resin and standard Fmoc chemistry (Scheme 5). The first Fmoc-amino acid was loaded onto 2-CTC resin in DCM in the presence of DIPEA, followed by the capping of unreacted resin sites with methanol. For the synthesis of 20 and 21, the 2-CTC resin was first loaded with an Fmoc-protected thiazole residue (Fmoc-Thz-OH) using analogous conditions. Subsequent amino acids were installed via iterative deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF) and coupling (N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and 3-hydroxytriazolo[4,5-b]pyridine (HOAt) in DMF) steps. After cleavage of linear hexapeptides from the resin using 1% TFA in DCM, macrocyclizations were performed using HBTU, DIPEA, and catalytic 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in DCM under dilute conditions (1\u20135 mM). The coupling site for macrocyclization was chosen to occur at N-terminal glycine for 15, C-terminal glycine for 17\u201319, or C-terminal thiazole for 20\u201321, as this provided the least degree of steric hindrance, resulting in favorable yields [37]. Moreover, cyclization of linear precursors to afford 17\u201321 took place at a C-terminal glycine or thiazole to prevent epimerization.",

The utilization of a pseudoproline residue in place of the proteinogenic Val residue during the synthesis of dichotomin A was a protecting group stratergy and a way to improve head-to-tail cyclization of linear peptide precursors because of the ability of pseudoproline to induce a turn or \u201ckink\u201d in the peptide backbone as well as to aid peptide solubility [8]. The pseudoproline residue was deprotected and converted into the desired Val residue post cyclization to afford dichotomin A (22). Dichotomin A was prepared from two different disconnection sites within the macrocyclic ring (Scheme 6). The first linear peptide precursor 23 contained a non-epimerizable C-terminal glycine and an N-terminal O-tert-butyl protected threonine residue. The second peptide precursor 24 contained an epimerizable N-terminal leucine and a C-terminal phenylalanine, creating a more sterically hindered cyclization site and providing a way to test the robustness of this methodology [8]. Linear peptides 23 and 24 containing pseudoproline residues were synthesized on 2-CTC resin using standard Fmoc-strategy SPPS with HBTU as the coupling reagent and 10% piperidine in DMF for Fmoc deprotection. Cleavage from resin was done using HFIP in DCM while keeping the side-chain protecting groups intact. The conformations of 23 and 24 were established using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rotating-frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) experiments, which also confirmed a single set of resonance structures for each peptide. Macrocycle 25 was obtained from linear peptides 23 or 24 containing a pseudoproline residue in less than 3 h and in good to excellent yields (78\u201388%) using 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium tetrafluoroborate (DMTMM\u00b7BF4). In contrast, cyclization of analogous linear peptide precursors containing a native Val residue had much slower reaction kinetics, requiring 3 days for reaction completion and with lower yields (33\u201336%). The pseudoproline and O-tert-butyl-Thr residues in 25 were simultaneously deprotected using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA)/water (2:1, v/v) to give 26 followed by desulfurization using NiCl2 and NaBH4 in MeOH to afford dichotomin A (22) in 24% yield.

Wollamide B (42) was obtained after removal of the side-chain protecting groups of 51 and final purification using flash column chromatography on silica gel. An optimization study investigated the efficiency of the macrocyclization step occurring at each of the six peptide bond sites. This determined that macrocyclization of the linear hexapeptide precursor between terminal L-Leu and D-Leu residues provided the most efficient macrocyclization without any detectable epimerization [45].

They demonstrated that the tri-N-methylated peptide 54 experienced increased cell permeability, higher plasma protein binding, and decreased clearance rates compared to the non-methylated variant 53 [23]. This resulted in a favorable bioavailability of 30% for the tri-N-methylated cyclohexapeptide 54. The cyclic hexapeptides cyclo-Leu-D-Leu\u2013Leu-Leu-D-Pro-Tyr (53) and cyclo-Leu-NMe-D-Leu-NMe-Leu-Leu-D-Pro-NMe-Tyr (54) were synthesized using traditional SPPS starting from a trityl resin preloaded with allyl ester Fmoc-Tyr, which was resin-linked via the Tyr side-chain hydroxyl group (Scheme 10). The resin-linked linear hexapeptide 55 was constructed using a sequence of coupling and deprotection steps. The allyl and N-terminal Fmoc groups were removed using Pd(PPh3)4 and 10% piperidine/THF, respectively, to give 56, which was cyclized on-resin using HATU/HOBt to give the resin-attached cyclohexapeptide 57. Cleavage of 57 from the resin using TFA provided 53. Cyclohexapeptide 54 was synthesized from 57 via the global and selective introduction of N-methyl groups using a LiOtBu base, followed by MeI to provide resin-attached trimethylated derivative 58 (Scheme 10). Cleavage of 58 from the resin afforded 54. An alternative synthesis of 54 was also investigated and involved a stepwise construction of the trimethylated linear hexapeptide using traditional SPPS followed by cleavage and solution-phase macrocyclization. Although two routes for the synthesis of 54 were investigated, the first route involving global N-methylation of the resin-bound cyclohexapeptide 57 followed by cleavage was more efficient and provided crude 54 in higher purity before final purification.

SPPS has enabled the rapid, efficient synthesis of hexapeptide and peptidomimetic libraries for subsequent biological evaluation and high-throughput screening. In this review, we summarize recent methods used in the successful construction of cyclohexapeptides using SPPS followed by on-resin or solution-phase cyclization.

The advantage of on-resin cyclization is that the formation of linear and/or cyclic oligomeric side products can be minimized. In addition, cyclization on-resin can shorten the synthetic route and minimize purification steps, although the reaction progress is more challenging to monitor. In the case of solution-phase cyclization, performing the reaction under dilute conditions (1\u20135 mM) can favor cyclization over dimer/oligomer formation. In some examples, adding the linear peptide precursor in a dropwise fashion to maintain high dilution was used successfully. Utilizing a turn-inducing pseudoproline residue can greatly enhance cyclization rates, although it is required to be deprotected post cyclization, with additional reaction step(s). On the other hand, epimerization of the C-terminal amino acid during cyclization can be attenuated by employing efficient coupling reagents, such as the azabenzotriazole class. Furthermore, epimerization can be completely avoided by choosing to cyclize at a non-epimerizable residue such as C-terminal Gly (when applicable) or by employing the method of O-N-acyl migration on cyclodepsipeptides precursors. Among various solid supports, 2-CTC resin remains one of the most popular resins in SPPS because of its mild acidolytic cleavage conditions as well as steric effect, preventing diketopiperazine formation.
