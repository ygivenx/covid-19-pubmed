The LPS-induced lung injury was also attenuated by MPAKs inhibitors prior to LPS administration in rats of these two groups (Fig. 7A,F and G).

These results indicate that blocking the MAPKs pathway can remarkably attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory response in Lenti-Ace2-RNAi infected rats and A779 or MLN-4760 pretreated rats with ACE2 overexpression. Furthermore, the histological evaluation of whole lung injury demonstrated that pretreatment with the specific MAPKs inhibitors significantly attenuated LPS-induced lung injury in Lenti-Ace2-RNAi infected rats, but did not significantly reverse the blockade of MLN4760 on the effects of ACE2 overexpression in preventing LPS-induced lung injury.

In different ARDS models, loss of ACE2 in mice resulted in more aggravated lung injury, whereas recombinant ACE2 attenuated the symptoms of ARDS in Ace2-knockout mice, especially in wild type mice15. The lung injury in ARDS mouse model caused by limb ischemia-reperfusion (LIR) was deteriorated by Ace2 depletion while protected by Ace2 transgene, and the changes of ACE2 expression in lung tissue were accompanied by alteration of Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio33. Prior studies have shown that down-regulation of ACE2 expression in lung and increased serum Ang II level are associated with severity of respiratory syncytial virus H7N9 or H5N1-induced ARDS, which is also ameliorated by administration of recombinant human ACE2343536. Moreover, the decrease of ACE2 activity in BALF of ventilated animals exposed to LPS was correlated with enhanced BALF Ang II but reduced Ang-(1-7) levels11. Similar to these previous studies, our results showed that ACE2 overexpression in rat lung reduced the BALF Ang II level and further increased Ang-(1-7) level in animals treated with LPS. The ratio of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) in BALF was significantly decreased by ACE2 overexpression while markedly increased by ACE2 knockdown. Despite the most of evidences suggest an decrease of Ang-(1-7) level in lung tissue during the development of ARDS, there are some conflicting results from published literatures. The Ang-(1-7) level in BALF increases during mechanical ventilation-induced rat lung injury but decreases after 24 hours of LPS administration11. In a mouse ARDS model, Ang-(1-7) in lung tissue was shown a decrease after 24 hours of LPS challenge37. In the early stage of LIR-induced ARDS, the lung tissue Ang-(1-7) level significantly increased at 1 hour and persisted up to 12 hours after reperfusion33. In the present study, we found that LPS administration caused a significant increase of Ang II and also an unexpected increase of Ang-(1-7) in BALF. In renin-angiotensin system, Ang-(1-7) is mainly generated by ACE2 hydrolyzing Ang II, but it also can be generated by ACE catalyzing Ang-(1-9). It is possible that the increased levels of Ang-(1-7) in lung tissue may play a compensatory role in the initial development of ARDS.",

In support of this hypothesis, Ang-(1-7) overexpression in lung tissue prevented bleomycin-induced lung injury, and blockade of the Mas receptor abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7) against monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension40. Ang-(1-7) or Mas agonist, AVE0991, prevent ventilator- or acid aspiration-induced lung injury, which was reversed by a Mas receptor antagonist41. In the present study, we demonstrated that Mas receptor antagonist effectively abolished the protective effects of ACE2 overexpression in the lung of rats exposed to LPS. In addition, Mas receptor antagonist also reversed the decrease of Ang II and increase of Ang-(1-7) in BALF of Lenti-Ace2 transduced rats, elevating the Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio. These results indicate that the protective effects of ACE2 on LPS-induced lung injury primarily depend on the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway.",

            "text": "The underlying molecular mechanism of ACE2 protects against ARDS remains elusive. Previous studies indicated that activation of MAPKs signaling promoted the progression of ARDS17, but the functional linkage of the MAPKs pathways with ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling axis in LPS-induced lung injury has not been elucidated. Our current study showed that LPS administration stimulated the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK, which was significantly reduced by ACE2 overexpression in lung tissue. Moreover, Ace2 shRNA enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK in rat lung. Either Mas receptor antagonist or ACE2 inhibitor completely abolished the inhibitory effects of AEC2 on LPS-induced p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Combined with the changes of Ang II/Ang-(1-7) and Mas mRNA, these results suggest that the protection of LPS-induced ARDS by ACE2 relies on the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway to inhibit the signaling cascade of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. Similar to our findings, Xue T et al. found that overexpression of ACE2 in rat lung attenuated smoking-induced lung inflammation via inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling44. Song B et al. reported that recombinant human ACE2 prevented Ang II-mediated myocardial injury through blocking the activation of ERK1/245. In addition, it has been shown that ACE2 regulates the balance of AngII/Ang(1-7) to prevent alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis and JNK phosphorylation, while pretreatment with A779 abolishes the anti-apoptotic effect of Ang-(1-7) and its inhibition of JNK phosphorylation46. ACE2 over-expression in PMVECs protects LPS-induced apoptosis and suppresses p38 MAPK/JNK phosphorylation, which was attenuated by pretreatment with A77925. These data indicate that the suppression of MAPKs activation by the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling pathway is cell type dependent.",

Upon stimulation by LPS or pro-inflammatory cytokines, I\u03baB protein is phosphorylated by activating I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and degraded, leading to activation and then translocation of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus to upregulate transcription of inflammatory genes4748. The activation of NF-\u03baB is pivotal to the development of endotoxin-induced ARDS in animals4950. Imai et al. identified the TLR4-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway as a key role in controlling severity of acute lung injury24. In the present in vivo study, overexpressing ACE2 in the rat lung significantly suppressed LPS-induced NF-\u03baB p50/p65 phosphorylation and enhanced I\u03baB\u03b1 expression, which was completely reversed by Mas receptor antagonist or ACE2 inhibitor pretreatment. In contrast with ACE2 overexpression, silencing ACE2 markedly enhanced LPS-induced activation of NF-\u03baB p50/p65 and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. These results indicate that NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is also important and may cooperate with MAPKs pathway to facilitate the protective effect of ACE2 against LPS-induced ARDS. The result of our in vitro study also suggests that ACE2 prevents PMVECs from LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation by inhibiting JNK and NF-\u03baB activity25. Our findings are consistent with previous observations that pharmacological inhibition of ERK or p38 attenuates LPS-induced lung injury via suppressing the activation of the NF-kB pathway1819.",
