            "text": "Divalent cations are essential co-factors for polymerase catalysis and are also required for the RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase (RT) [1,2]. HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer consisting of p66 and p51 subunits, with the p66 subunit performing both the polymerase and RNase H activities [3]. Under physiological conditions, Mg2+ functions as the co-factor for both activities. In addition to Mg2+, RT in vitro can use alternative divalent cations such as Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+ and Zn2+ for polymerase activity [4]. These cations are important to many cellular processes and are tightly regulated. The total concentration of Zn2+ in cells is ~0.1-0.5 mM [5-8] while the total concentration of Mn2+ in red blood cells is ~2.5- 3 \u03bcM [9,10], and Co2+ in the serum is in the low \u03bcM range [11]. The available free concentration of all these cations is kept extremely low by cellular mechanisms [12,13]. Therefore, we believe these divalent cations do not play a significant role in the HIV replication lifecycle.",

Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ have all been shown to dramatically decrease the fidelity of DNA synthesis by several human, bacterial, and viral polymerases including HIV RT [37-43]. Mn2+ and Co2+ decreased the fidelity of avian myeoblastosis virus (AMV) RT and human DNA polymerase I in a concentration-dependent manner [40]. Increased error frequency in presence of Mn2+ has also been observed in vitro with HIV RT [43], Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I [44], phage T4 DNA polymerase [45], DNA polymerases \u03b1 and \u03b2 [46], and Taq polymerase [47]. Most of these experiments were performed using concentrations of divalent cation higher than those required for maximal enzyme activity. However, we recently reported that physiological Mg2+ concentrations, which are lower than the high concentration typically used to optimize enzyme kinetics in vitro, can increase RT fidelity [48].",

Although Mn2+ and Co2+ were previously demonstrated to support RT catalysis, our recent publication [20] was the first to show (to our knowledge) that Zn2+, a potent polymerase inhibitor, can also support polymerase catalysis [15]. Therefore, we wanted to look more closely at how this previously untested divalent cation affects RT fidelity. A better understanding of the fidelity of RT with these alternative cations could also be important for modulating the accuracy of RT-PCR reactions. Mn2+ is already being used in PCR reactions to generate random mutations [47]. In this report, we show that under optimal extension conditions, Zn2+ increases the fidelity of RT, a previously unprecedented observation of an alternative cation for a polymerase. We also show that presumed pro-mutagenic cations, such as Mn2+ and Co2+, are not mutagenic with HIV RT at concentrations optimal for dNTP catalysis. The potential mechanisms by which Zn2+ enhance fidelity as well as the reason for the concentration-dependence of mutagenesis is discussed.",

Optimal extension for each cation in the presence of 100 \u03bcM of each dNTP was observed at the following concentrations: 2 mM Mg2+, 0.4 mM Zn2+, 0.4 mM Mn2+, and 0.25 mM Co2+. Since a total concentration of 400 \u03bcM total nts (100 \u03bcM each) was used in the assays, the free concentration of each cation for optimal extension was ~1.6 mM for Mg2+, 0.15 mM for Zn2+, 0.15 mM for Mn2+, and 0.07 mM for Co2+. Note that all 3 alternative cations showed maximal activity at much lower concentrations than Mg2+. This suggests that these alternative cations bind more tightly to RT than the physiological cation. Interestingly, we also found that Cu2+ supported RT catalysis but optimum extension occurred at a much higher concentration of 3 mM (data not shown). Average and maximum extension rates were then calculated as described in Materials and Methods using the RNA template used for round 1 synthesis of the PCR-based lacZ\u03b1-complementation fidelity assay. As expected, the rate of synthesis was fastest using Mg2+ and slowest with Zn2+ (Figure 1 and Table 1). An average extension rate of 1.8 \u00b1 0.48 nts/s and a maximal extension rate of 7.4 \u00b1 1.9 nts/s was observed with 2 mM Mg2+, whereas with 0.4 mM Zn2+, extension rates were 0.03 \u00b1 0.02 nts/s and 0.19 \u00b1 0.10 nts/s, respectively. Both 0.4 mM Mn2+ and 0.25 mM Co2+ decreased the average and maximal rate of extension as well (Table 1).",

The 115 nt region screened for mutations is shown in Figure 2C. The assay is capable of detecting all frameshift mutations and several substitutions (see legend) in this region [51]. The assay essentially mimics the reverse transcription process since both RNA- and DNA-directed RT synthesis steps are performed. Most of the possible background mutations can be accounted for by performing a control in which plasmid DNA is PCR amplified to produce an insert identical to those produced in the complete assay. These inserts should comprise all error sources except the errors derived from HIV RT and T3 RNA polymerase. An average background colony mutant frequency (CMF, number of white or faint blue colonies divided by total colonies) of 0.0019 \u00b1 0.0014 was obtained (Table 2). This corresponds to 1 white or faint blue colony in every ~500 colonies. Further details of this assay are discussed in a recent publication by our group [48].",

Results using Co2+ were similar to Mg2+ while Zn2+ increased fidelity about 2.5-fold (with high statistical significance). Although Co2+ is reported to be mutagenic, its effect on the mutation rate of polymerases is concentration-dependent [40,42,46]. For example, the error frequency of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT increased from about 1 error per 1680 nt additions with Mg2+ to 1 error per 1100 nt addition with activating concentrations of Co2+ (1 mM), but increased further to 1 error per 200 nt addition when excess amounts of Co2+ were used (5 mM) [40]. Only 0.07 mM free Co2+ was used in these assays and it is possible that Co2+ does not have a profound impact on fidelity at this concentration. This was further tested in the gapped plasmid assay described below.",

The gap filled by the polymerase is in a plasmid construct, which after fill in, is directly transfected into bacteria. Bacterial colonies rather than phage plaques are scored by blue-white screening in this assay. This assay screens a large region (288 nts) of the lacZ\u03b1 gene including the promoter sequence and it avoids the enzymatic (T3 RNA polymerase and Pfu polymerase) background issues of the PCR-based assay. The results (Table 3) were in strong agreement with the PCR-based assay (Table 2). In this assay, Mg2+ was modestly more accurate than 0.25 mM Co2+, while Zn2+ once again showed ~2.5\u2013fold greater fidelity than Mg2+. Interestingly, Mn2+, a known pro-mutagenic cation for several polymerases including HIV RT [43], was comparable to Mg2+ in the assays when used at its optimal concentration (0.4 mM total and 0.15 mM free). However, both Co2+and Mn2+ were highly mutagenic when used at 6 mM, an amount which is in the same range shown by others to decrease the fidelity of several polymerases in vitro [39-43,52]. There was a ~25-fold decrease in fidelity with 6 mM Mn2+ compared to 0.4 mM Mn2+. Similarly, a ~7-fold decrease in fidelity was observed with 6 mM vs. 0.25 mM Co2+. Both cations also showed severely inhibited polymerase activity at the 6 mM concentration while Zn2+ incorporates only a few nts even after prolonged incubation at high concentrations (see [4], results with Co2+ were similar to those shown with Mn2+ in this report). Overall, the results from both the PCR-based and gapped plasmid-based lacZ\u03b1-complementation fidelity assays show that the fidelity of RT increases with Zn2+ and presumed pro-mutagenic cations do not modify RT\u2019s error rate significantly when used at low concentrations optimal for catalysis.",

Using a 33.6% detection rate for substitutions and 100% detection rate for indels in this region (see Figure 2C and accompanying legend) and a CMF of 0.0059 (from Table 1), the mutation frequency for Mg2+ was 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22125, or ~1 error per 18,000 incorporations ((0.0059 \u00d7 0.41)/230 = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 for indels, and ((0.0059 \u00d7 0.59)/230)/0.336 = 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 for substitutions, total is 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 for both (see Figure 3 legend for further details)). Synthesis with Zn2+ resulted in a higher ratio of indels vs. substitution: indels ~63% (26/41), and ~37% substitutions (15/41) were obtained. With a CMF of 0.0025 (Table 1), a mutation frequency of 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 or ~ 1 error per 53,000 incorporations was obtained for experiments with Zn2+.

Although pre-steady-state assays are more useful for understanding kinetic parameters for misincorporation, steady-state assays are much simpler to perform and typically yield results that are broadly similar to results with pre-steady-state assays [54]. Mismatched primer extension and running-start assays using the sequences shown in Figure 4 were performed with constant concentrations of free cation of 0.4 mM Zn2+ or 2 mM Mg2+. Note that reactions with each cation were performed using different enzyme concentrations and time points (see Materials and Methods). This was necessary as catalysis with Zn2+ is much slower than Mg2+ yielding negligible levels of extension with the conditions used for Mg2+. The results with Zn2+ were seemingly consistent with steady-state conditions as the reactions were conducted over a prolonged period (30 min) and the ratio of unextended to extended primers remained high (i.e. the substrate was not significantly depleted). However, it is possible that these reactions may to some extent reflect pre-steady-state conditions, to an extent, since RT-primer-template complexes are extremely stable in Zn2+ while catalysis is slow [20]. Because of these constraints, a direct comparison of the kinetic and equilibrium constants between the two cations cannot be made. However, the fidelity with Zn2+ relative to that with Mg2+ can still be estimated by comparing misinsertion ratios calculated for particular mismatches with each cation. The running-start assays performed here test RT\u2019s ability to misincorporate at a template C or G residue (depending on the sequence) after a \u201crunning-start\u201d on a run of T\u2019s immediately downstream of the primer 3\u2032 terminus. Experiments were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels (Figure 4B). A statistically pronounced (based on P-values) increase in fidelity was observed for all mismatches with Zn2+ (Table 4). The misinsertion ratio for the G.A mismatch, which is a difficult mismatch to make [48], could not be evaluated with Zn2+ as no incorporation was detected (data not shown). In general, there was a ~4-fold to 8-fold increase in fidelity for different mismatches in Zn2+ compared to Mg2+.",

The geometry supported by different cations in the active site of polymerases has been proposed to affect fidelity. Magnesium supports tetrahedral symmetry at the active site, whereas Mn2+ accommodates square planar, octahedral, and tetrahedral symmetries (reviewed in [57]). The ability of Mn2+ to accommodate more than one type of symmetry may increase the reaction rate of misaligned substrates and hence decrease the fidelity of polymerization. It is important to note that although results presented here indicate Mn2+ is not highly mutagenic at optimal concentrations, this may not be the case for other polymerases. Crystal structures of polymerases with Zn2+ in the active site are not available, but Zn2+ has been crystallized in a distorted tetrahedral symmetry in erythrocyte carbonic-anhydrase [58], as well as in a near tetrahedral geometry in Zn2+ superoxide dismutase [59]. It is possible that Zn2+ supports a different geometry than Mg2+ in the active site and promotes a configuration of the amino acid residues which may be better suited to discriminate against misaligned substrates.",

            "text": "Results showed that the fidelity of HIV RT with Mn2+ and Co2+ was concentration-dependent, as we observed previously for Mg2+ [48]. Although Mn2+ is generally considered to be pro-mutagenic [57], the error frequency for several DNA polymerases usually increased as the Mn2+ concentration increased [52]. In one report, E. coli DNA polymerase I and mammalian DNA polymerase \u03b2 both showed relatively high fidelity when lower concentrations (below ~100 \u03bcM) of Mn2+ were used, whereas higher concentrations lead to greater mutagenesis. The high concentrations correlated with Mn2+ binding to the single stranded template and possibly to secondary binding sites on the polymerase, raising the possibility that these factors promote the lower fidelity observed at high Mn2+ concentrations [60]. In this regard, E. coli DNA polymerase I has been reported to have as many as 21 Mn2+ binding sites on a single molecule but just a single high affinity binding site [61]. The effect, if any, of binding at the secondary sites is unknown. Still, when compared to Mg2+, careful analysis with other polymerases has suggested that Mn2+ is promutagenic over a range of concentrations [62]. Differences between our results and these may stem from intrinsic differences in the enzymes or the different nucleic acid substrate used (many of the former experiments used homopolymers). Also, unlike RT, most DNA polymerases have intrinsic exonuclease activity. El-Deiry et al. [62] found that E. coli DNA polymerase I demonstrated a significant reduction in 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity in the presence of Mn2+. This effect exacerbated the accelerated misincorporation with Mn2+ which was observed.",

            "text": "It is also possible that Zn2+ affects the rate of conformational change in the enzyme and this leads to an alteration in fidelity. Catalysis with Zn2+ is extremely slow (Table 1 and [20]) even though the complex between the enzyme and primer-template is over 100 times more stable than with Mg2+ [20]. This indicates that one or more of the steps in catalysis is slow. Conformational transition of the protein after binding the substrate has a significant contribution to the ability of RT to add the correct substrate [63]. Upon binding the substrate in Mg2+, the enzyme undergoes a conformational change to reach the transition state. A correctly matched nt then leads to tight binding and alignment of catalytic residues to promote catalysis, whereas a mismatched nt does not induce the tight binding state, thereby facilitating the rapid opening of the specificity domain and release of the misaligned substrate [63]. The conformational change in the specificity subdomain (fingers subdomain) of the polymerase plays a key role in determining the enzyme fidelity, and it will be interesting to investigate if the modified catalysis with Zn2+ affects either the conformational change or the rate of conformational change in a way which might increase the specificity. Consistent with the model of slower catalysis promoting higher fidelity, suboptimal Mg2+ concentrations also enhanced fidelity [48]. The observed enhancement was similar to what was observed with Zn2+ as it resulted mostly due to a decrease in substitutions rather than insertion and deletion errors. Since insertions and deletions often result from primer-template slippage mechanisms, this suggests that both low Mg2+ and Zn2+ induce higher fidelity by intrinsically affecting RT catalysis rather than altering primer-template properties. It is possible that lowering the Zn2+ concentration to suboptimal levels could also alter fidelity, however, catalysis dramatically declines as the concentration of Zn2+ is either lowered or increased [20], making it difficult to test this possibility.",

Full extension produced a 199 nt final product (see Figure 2A). The long template was used to make it easier to separate DNA synthesis products from the RNA template on a denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel (see below). The primer-template complex was pre-incubated in 48 \u03bcl of buffer (see below) for 3 min at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was initiated by addition of 2 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcM HIV RT in 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8, 80 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 10% glycerol and incubation was continued for 30 min for Mg2+, 1 hour for Mn2+ and Co2+, and 3 hours for Zn2+. Different time points were used to assure that all the reactions were essentially complete with each cation. The final concentration of reaction components were 200 nM HIV RT, 25 nM template, 50 nM primer, 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 80 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.4% glycerol and 0.4 units/\u03bcl RNasin along with different concentrations of salts. A final concentration of 100 \u03bcM dNTPs was used along with one of the following divalent cation: 2 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM CoCl2, 0.4 mM ZnCl2. The final pH of the reactions was 7.7. After incubations, 1 \u03bcl of DNase-free RNase was added and the sample was heated to 65\u00b0C for 5 min. Typically two reactions for each condition were combined and material was recovered by standard phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in 20 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7) and 2X loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8), 0.25% each bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol) and products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels (19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide). Fully extended 199 nt DNA was located using a phosphoimager (Fujifilm FLA5100), and recovered by the crush and soak method [65] in 500 \u03bcl of elution buffer containing 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7). After overnight elution, this material was passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filter and recovered by ethanol precipitation after addition of 10% volume 3 M sodium acetate (pH 7) and 50 \u03bcg of glycogen. After centrifugation, the pellets were vigorously washed with 500 \u03bcl of 70% ethanol to remove any traces of EDTA that may have carried over from the gel and potentially interfere with the second round of synthesis. The recovered DNA was hybridized to another 20 nt radiolabeled DNA primer (5\u2032-AGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGC-3\u2032) with 10-fold greater specific activity than the primer used for round one, and a second round of DNA synthesis was performed as described above except the reaction volume was 25 \u03bcl. Conditions for the cation, dNTPs, and pH were identical in the RNA- and DNA-templated reactions. Reactions were terminated with an equal volume of 2X loading buffer and products were gel purified as described above but on an 8% gel. The gel was run far enough to efficiently separate the 199 nt templates from the 162 nt full extension product of round 2.",

The average extension rate can then be calculated using the following expression:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\frac{\\Sigma\\ \\left[\\left(s-20\\right)*y\\right]}{t} $$\\end{document}\u03a3s\u221220*yt",
