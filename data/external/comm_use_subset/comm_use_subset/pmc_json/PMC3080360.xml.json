Interestingly, one animal showed a clear progression on day 2 with small ventral-most consolidation in left middle/caudal lung (right lateral view) and heavy peribronchial markings (Fig. 1). Notable improvement was seen by day 4 with mild interstitial infiltrates centrally, and unsharp CVC margins on both lateral views. Surprisingly, infection with GZ02 did not result in significant radiological changes early in infection, although mild increase in interstitial infiltrates could be observed in 1 animal on day 2 (Fig. 1).",

These mutations also differentially affected replication in primary human airway epithelial cultures showing that in contrast to zoonotic SARS-CoV strains, human strains replicated efficiently in these cultures [19].

            "text": "Several groups have shown that cynomolgus macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV, although the clinical presentation is variable [15], [21], [22], [23]. However, these initial studies did not control for the age of the animals. Advanced age significantly increases the severity of SARS-CoV infection and was correlated with increased morbidity and mortality in humans [1]. In a recent study, SARS-CoV infection in 10\u201319 year old cynomolgus macaques resulted in decreased activity and mildly labored breathing in some animals [24]. In addition, pulmonary consolidation was observed as well as diffuse alveolar damage. In this study we infected 8\u201315 year old cynomolgus macaques with 3 recombinant SARS-CoV bearing S glycoprotein variants however the increased age did not result in overt clinical symptoms in our cynomolgus macaque model. In comparison, we previously infected cynomolgus macaques with the newly emerged H1N1 influenza virus which resulted in increased respiratory rates, nasal discharge, mild-moderate radiographical changes and gross pathologic lesions in the lungs [25]. One possible explanation for the differences observed between the 2 SARS-CoV studies is the use of different SARS-CoV strains. In the current study we used the Urbani strain, whereas Smits et al used a different strain of SARS-CoV (HK-39), isolated from one of the earliest Hong Kong patients, which contains several mutations throughout the genome [26]. These observed a.a. changes between the Urbani and HK-39 strain may affect the pathogenesis in the cynomolgus macaque model. In this study the recombinant SARS-CoV strains bearing the variant S glycoproteins were all constructed in the Urbani background. We had previously hypothesized that the 3 recombinant SARS-CoV strains would show differences in replication in non-human primates due to the fact that both the Urbani and GZ02 strains replicated efficiently in human airway epithelium, whereas the zoonotic strains including HC/SZ/61/03 did not [19]. This was in agreement with observations in human cases of SARS-CoV infection where infection with late phase SARS-CoV strains resulted in more severe disease and efficient transmission compared to the mild sporadic cases during the zoonotic phase of the epidemic [2]. It has been shown that the S glycoproteins of these strains have adapted to more efficient binding to its receptor ACE2 [7], [8], [27]. Indeed the epidemic Urbani strain replicated to higher titers compared to GZ02 and HC/SZ/61/03, and shedding of these viruses could be detected primarily in the nasal and oral swabs as a measure for potential transmission. However, unlike infection in mice [20], no differences were found in the cell tropism with all 3 SARS-CoV strains targeting primarily type II pneumocytes. While no viral antigen was detected in the trachea of HC/SZ/61/03 infected animals, the recovery of infectious virus from this tissue suggests that the absence of antigen is unlikely to be due to a difference in tropism but rather due to limitations in detection.",

We hypothesize that the SARS-CoV S glycoproteins from the different zoonotic and human phases of the epidemic may differentially down-regulate ACE2, resulting in the observed disconnect between virus replication and pathogenesis. However unlike in the mouse model, no differences in ACE2 expression could be observed by gene expression or immunohistochemistry (data not shown) in cynomolgus macaques, possibly due to the mild disease progression observed in the current model. While the S glycoprotein is a major virulence factor [8], [19], [27], it cannot be excluded that the additional mutations in the rest of the genomes of the GZ02 and HC/SZ/61/03 strains could be necessary for a more virulent phenotype in the cynomolgus macaque model.",

Interestingly, SARS-CoV infection did result in radiological changes including pulmonary infiltration and peribronchial markings early during infection. Although observed earlier, it is similar to what was seen in mild human cases [31] as well as in animals infected by the IN route [15]. In contrast, animals infected by the IN and intrabronchial (IB) route showed early radiological changes in the lower lung lobes [15]. One explanation for the early detection of radiological changes in the current model is that animals were infected intratracheally with a high dose of SARS-CoV. Intratracheal instillation resulted in the presence of a high virus load in the trachea and bronchi of the animal, and subsequent peribronchial markings observed early on during infection. Natural infection in human cases would result from exposure to a lower virus dose and a less efficient route [32], [33]. In contrast, infection by the intrabronchial route results in initial virus replication in the interstitium, resulting in radiological changes in the lower lobes early during infection [15]. The radiological changes correlated with the observed histopathology in the lungs. While this model did not exhibit the severe diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), edema and hyaline membrane formation associated with severe human cases of SARS-CoV infection [34], alveolitis with edema, fibrin deposits and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia was observed in some animals infected with the GZ02 and HC/SZ/61/03 strains but not in Urbani infected animals. This is in agreement with observations in mice where increased severity of lung pathology also did not correlate with virus replication in the lung and the Urbani strain replicated to 1\u20132 log higher titers compared to the GZ02 and HC/SZ/61/03 strains.",

In addition, several animal models have shown that an acute and exacerbated host response results in acute lung injury [20], [24]. In the current study we observed an early upregulation of genes associated with IFN signaling and activation of IFN related pathways. This early upregulation has previously been shown in mouse and non-human primate models of SARS-CoV infection as well as influenza infection [20], [24], [36], [37]. In particular, early enhanced expression of interferon-inducible protein-10 (CXCL-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) have been correlated with an adverse outcome during SARS-CoV infection in humans [38], [39], which was also highly upregulated in this study. Unfortunately, due to the animal-to-animal variation, differentially expressed genes could only be identified on day 1 p.i. Interestingly, no differences were observed in the pathways involved in all 3 SARS-CoV strains, although the number of genes involved in these pathways were higher in Urbani infected animals compared to GZ02 or HC/SZ/61/03 infected animals. In addition, the fold-changes were also greater following infection with the Urbani strain compared to GZ02 and HC/SZ/61/03. The higher upregulation of host genes following Urbani infection correlates with the observed replication. In agreement with the observed host gene response, expression of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1ra, IL-12, IL-13 and MCP-1 was upregulated in the lungs of infected animals on day 1 p.i. Upregulation of these genes was previously observed in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in human cases of SARS [40], [41], [42]. In addition, MCP-1 was also found to be upregulated in plasma from H1N1 influenza infected macaques [25].",

In addition we show that infection results in prolonged shedding of the virus in nasal and oral secretions up to 7 days post challenge as a potential method of transmission. Finally, infection with the 3 SARS-CoV strains induces host responses early during infection. These data show that the new cynomolgus macaque models will be important in testing the efficacy of vaccine candidates or therapeutics against antigenically distinct SARS-CoV strains [43]. To date, the majority of vaccine studies have focused on the epidemic Urbani strain which provide limited protection against heterologous strains, especially in senescent populations that are more at risk for severe disease [10], [18]. The epidemic SARS-CoV strains are extinct; however zoonotic strains may still emerge from animal reservoirs like bats, palm-civets and raccoondogs. Therefore a SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection against replication and shedding of both the epidemic strains and any zoonotic strain that may emerge.",

Animals were housed in adjoining individual primate cages allowing social interactions, under controlled conditions of humidity, temperature and light (12-hour light/12-hour dark cycles). Food and water were available ad libitum. Animals were monitored (pre- and post-infection) and fed commercial monkey chow, treats and fruit twice daily by trained personnel. Environmental enrichment consisted of commercial toys. All procedures were conducted by trained personnel under the supervision of veterinarians and all invasive clinical procedures were performed while animals were anesthetized.
