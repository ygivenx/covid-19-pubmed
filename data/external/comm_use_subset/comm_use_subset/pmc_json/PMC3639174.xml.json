Naturally, viruses evolved to encode not only proteins necessary for their replication, such as their polymerase and capsid protein, but also security proteins that counteract the host defenses [2]. As unimpeded induction and action of interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infection leads to a powerful antiviral state that strongly restricts replication of most viruses [3], viral IFN antagonists constitute a major class of security proteins [4], [5]. IFN antagonists can be further distinguished based on their ability to i) inhibit the virus-dependent signaling necessary for the production of IFNs and other cytokines; ii) inhibit the IFN-dependent signaling necessary for the induction of antiviral genes; or iii) inhibit the activity of antiviral proteins.",

Its genome consists of a \u223c30 kb linear, non-segmented, capped, polycistronic, polyadenylated RNA molecule, the first two-third of which is directly translated into two large polyproteins. These two polypeptides are processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), forming the replicase complex, which is active in the cytoplasm in close association with cellular membranes. Transcription and replication of the coronaviral genome leads to the expression of open reading frames located in the remaining third of the genome, which encode structural proteins such as S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane) and NP (nucleocapsid protein), as well as other open reading frames (ORFs) whose functions remain to be fully characterized [6]\u2013[9].",

However, validation of their role as genuine IFN antagonists in the context of the live virus was obtained only for nsp1 so far [16], [25]. Two mechanisms were identified to account for the IFN antagonist activity of nsp1, general inhibition of host gene expression [13], [16], [25] and inhibition of antiviral signal transduction [16]. Specifically, nsp1 inhibits host gene expression by decreasing translation efficiency and by destabilizing mRNAs [13], [25], [26]. Additionally, nsp1 expression inhibits the three virus-dependent signaling pathways that lead to activation of the transcription factors ATF2/c-Jun, IRF3/IRF7, and NF-\u03baB, preventing full induction of virus-inducible genes, such as IFNB [16]; moreover, nsp1 decreases the levels of STAT1 phosphorylation, inhibiting the induction of genes by IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 [16].",

We determined that SARS-CoV nsp1 main functional activities, inhibition of host gene expression and inhibition of antiviral signaling, could be genetically separated. Mapping of residues involved in inhibitory functions on the surface of nsp1 suggests it interacts with distinct host factors to inhibit host gene expression and antiviral signaling.",

Bradford Assay was used to determine protein concentration of extracts, and ten micrograms of total protein per sample was loaded onto gels. Quantitation of immunoblots was done using ImageJ [31]. To calculate relative STAT1 phosphorylation, the quantity of phosphorylated STAT1 was divided by the quantity of total STAT1 for each time point. To calculate the relative IRF3 dimerization, the quantity of IRF3 dimer was divided by the quantity of IRF3 monomer plus the dimer for each time point.

            "text": "To distinguish between these possible modes of action, we carried out a mutational analysis of SARS-CoV nsp1. Before the structure of SARS-CoV nsp1 was determined, we initially selected a few amino acids that were predicted to be solvent exposed (mutants m1\u2013m8); after the NMR structure of SARS-CoV nsp1 was reported [32], we selected additional solvent exposed residues for replacement (mutants m9\u2013m39). The nature of the selected residues was changed, e.g., positively charged to negatively charged, so that if the amino acid was involved in an interaction with a host factor, that interaction would likely be disrupted. This abrogation of nsp1 to host-protein interactions would be reflected in the attenuation of standard assays measuring the level of nsp1 inhibition of host functions. The nsp1 mutants were generated by PCR, cloned into plasmids (Figure 1A), and were co-transfected into 293T cells along with plasmids expressing luciferase, \u03b2-galactosidase, eGFP, and a reporter plasmid expressing the CAT gene under the control of a virus- and IFN-inducible ISRE, ISREx3-CAT (Figure 1B). Standardized luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase assays were used as a proxy for an nsp1 mutant\u2019s ability to inhibit host gene expression; inhibition of luciferase activity by nsp1-wt is mild (\u223c40%) while inhibition of \u03b2-galactosidase is strong (\u223c90%) [16]; other investigators used different reporters as proxy for nsp1 effects on host gene expression [13], [25], [33], [34]. Expression of the ISREx3CAT reporter is stimulated by both IFN treatment and SeV infection and coexpression of SARS-CoV nsp1-wt results in an inhibition of that stimulation, which we previously showed was due to an inhibitory effect on signaling and not on expression of the CAT gene [16]. Thus, CAT expression is used here as a proxy for an nsp1 mutant\u2019s ability to inhibit virus- and IFN-dependent signaling. Immunoblots were run and quantitated to measure the expression levels of all nsp1 mutants in these experiments (Figure 1C). Direct measurement of virus- and IFN-dependent signaling was also carried out (see below).",

Variant nsp1-m5 phenotype of partial inhibition of host signaling with strong inhibition of \u03b2-galactosidase expression is consistent with our hypothesis that nsp1 exerts its pleiotropic inhibitory effects by interacting with more than one host protein.",

Variants nsp1-m16 (D33R, E36R, E37R, S40R) and nsp1-m17 (E41R, R43E, E44R, K47E) were selected for their immediate proximity to the residues mutated in nsp1-m5 to attempt to further separate the inhibition of antiviral signaling from the inhibition of host gene expression. Mutants nsp1-m17 and -m18 (incorporating both m16 and m17 mutations), were not significantly different from nsp1-m5 in their ability to inhibit the CAT reporter stimulation by IFN or SeV. By contrast, nsp1-m16 exhibited a complete loss of inhibition of antiviral signaling (Figure 4A), while maintaining strong inhibition of \u03b2-galactosidase expression (Figure 4C). In addition, mutations introduced in the intrinsically disordered C-terminal segment (amino acids 128\u2013180) of nsp1, expressed relatively poorly (mutants nsp1-m12 and -m13) or barely at all (mutants nsp1-m25 and -m26, Figure 4D). Mutant nsp1-m25 targeted the same residues as nsp1-m8, but instead of replacing the acidic residues with lysines, arginine residues were substituted to test the possibility that the lack of nsp1-m8 expression was due to ubiquitination of those lysines; rather, our results suggest that the charge change was sufficient to interfere with expression of nsp1. Variants nsp1-m25 and -m26 were consistently expressed at such very low levels in transfected cells, displaying no inhibitory activities, that we removed them from further consideration in our measurements (Table 1).",

Expression of nsp1-m16 resulted in no decrease in either STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF3 dimerization, confirming the loss of antiviral signaling inhibition observed by CAT assay. Since nsp1-m16 retained the ability to inhibit gene expression, this mutation genetically separates the two inhibitory activities of SARS-CoV nsp1. By contrast, nsp1-m14, -m27 and -m30, which showed increased inhibition of the CAT reporter, had wildtype or partially attenuated inhibition of antiviral signaling (Fig. 4). Therefore, the increased inhibition of the CAT reporter by nsp1-m14, -m27 and -m30 must be accounted for by an inhibitory effect on CAT mRNA expression, consistent with the observed increased inhibition of \u03b2-galactosidase and luciferase activities by these mutants.",

Point mutations in proteins often affect their expression levels by modulating transcription, mRNA stability, translation and/or protein stability, and we found this to be true for SARS-CoV nsp1 mutants as well. Since SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibitory activities are dose-dependent [16], we additionally normalized the measured inhibition to the levels of expression for each mutant (Table 1). Expression-normalized inhibition was used to classify the nsp1 mutants according to their ability to attenuate or increase inhibition of \u03b2-galactosidase expression and/or inhibition of antiviral signaling, leading to the identification of six broad groups, A-F, Table 1 (inhibition of luciferase expression was not considered as it was only reduced 1.6-fold by nsp1-wt). Group A mutant displayed partial attenuation of both gene expression and antiviral signaling; group B mutants had loss most inhibition of both gene expression and antiviral signaling; group C mutants; group C displayed differential effects on gene expression and signaling, with strongly reduced inhibition of signaling and maintained inhibition of gene expression; group D had increased inhibition of signaling and maintained inhibition of gene expression; group E displayed increased inhibition of both signaling and gene expression; and group F had no clear phenotype.

Their expression could be higher during virus infection because of less self-inhibition in that context, and thus their IFN antagonism may be correspondingly higher. Consistent with the possibility of self-inhibition in transfection experiments, it was recently shown that natural SARS-CoV NP subgenomic mRNA escapes nsp1-mediated degradation, although translation of this mRNA is still inhibited by nsp1 [35]. This indicates some level of specificity for the targeting of mRNA degradation, but its molecular basis remains elusive. However, many mutants characterized in this study may be useful to elucidate the molecular basis of this function. Some mutations in SARS-CoV nsp1 changed the profile of the genes whose expression was affected: nsp1-wt strongly inhibited \u03b2-galactosidase expression but had little effect on the other genes, while other mutants showed increased luciferase inhibition with no change in \u03b2-galactosidase inhibition (e.g., nsp1-m22, -m37) and others also very strongly inhibited CAT expression (nsp1-m14, -m27, Figure 4).",

Here, we carried out a detailed mutational analysis and identified functional surface residues of SARS-CoV nsp1 that are differentially involved in its various inhibitory functions. A summary of SARS-CoV mutations analysis is presented in Figure 7, where the mutated amino acid residues are color-coded according to their phenotypes (Table 1). None of the mutants tested displayed a significant difference in their ability to target IFN- versus virus-dependent signaling. Few mutations had no effect on nsp1 activities (purple, group F); some mutations partially (blue, group A) or almost completely (green, group B) attenuated the ability of nsp1 to inhibit both antiviral signaling and gene expression; other mutations strongly repressed the ability of nsp1 to inhibit antiviral signaling without affecting inhibition of gene expression (yellow, group C); other mutations increased the ability of nsp1 to inhibit antiviral signaling without affecting inhibition of gene expression (orange, group D); finally, some mutations (red, group E) increased both the inhibition of antiviral signaling and gene expression. Thus, our data indicate that inhibition of host gene expression and inhibition of antiviral signaling could be genetically separated and suggest that distinct but overlapping surfaces of SARS-CoV nsp1 are involved in interactions with factors that mediate inhibition of gene expression (red, green and blue) and with factors that mediate inhibition of antiviral signaling (red, orange, yellow, green and blue) (Figure 7).",

One of these host factors has been identified as the 40S subunit of the ribosome and can account for nsp1 inhibition of translation [26]. However, the factors responsible for increased mRNA degradation and for inhibition of signaling remain to be discovered. In addition, a recent two-hybrid screen identified a large number of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV nsp1, including several members of the immunophilin and calcipressin families [36]. This ability of SARS-CoV nsp1 to interact with multiple proteins despite its small size (180 residues) may be mediated in part by its disordered domains (a.a. 1\u201312, a.a.128\u2013180 [32]). Intrinsically disordered domains are present in numerous proteins and their structural plasticity allows them to adopt different partial or fully ordered conformations when interacting with different ligands, increasing the size of the repertoire of proteins with which they can interact [37].",

By contrast, other IFN antagonists specifically target IFN- or virus-dependent signaling, or IFN-induced proteins with antiviral function [4], [5]. In a first approximation, the mechanism by which IFN production/action are inhibited does not matter; the net result is a deficient IFN response. SARS-CoV nsp1 is unusual in that it inhibits gene expression and it inhibits both virus- and IFN-dependent signaling [16]. A mutant such as nsp1-m16, which lacks any ability to inhibit antiviral signaling while maintaining inhibition of gene expression, may prove useful to determine the relative importance of various inhibitory functions in evasion from the innate immune response and in overall virulence. Inhibition of signaling may be a more efficient strategy to antagonize the antiviral response than inhibition of gene expression due to the relative scarcity of signaling proteins vs. the abundance of components of the gene expression machinery, such as ribosomes. Thus, the levels of nsp1 necessary to inhibit a signaling target will be reached earlier during the replication cycle than those necessary to inhibit translation. The need for IFN antagonists to reach a threshold level before becoming effective is illustrated by the observation that at an early time point during SARS-CoV infection, IRF3 is observed to translocate to the nucleus whereas it is excluded from the nucleus at a later time point [38].",

It has been shown that genes encoding inflammatory mediators are expressed at relatively much higher levels in SARS patients and in vitro tissue culture models than IFN genes when compared with other viral infections [40]\u2013[45]. SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibitory effects on antiviral signaling [16] and its stimulatory effect on the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway [36] likely contribute to the increased production of inflammatory mediators in SARS patients.

Consistent with such an evolutionary successful solution, several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have an established niche in humans and cause no or mild disease in healthy adults [7]\u2013[9], [11], [12]. By contrast, SARS-CoV emergence in humans from another animal niche caused severe disease and even death in a substantial fraction of infected individuals [7]\u2013[10]. Significantly, several SARS-CoV nsp1 mutations increased its ability to function as an IFN antagonist (e.g., nsp1-m14, -m27 and -m30, Figures 4&5). This increase was not due to increased inhibition of signaling (Figure 6), but was due to increased inhibition of gene expression (\u03b2-galactosidase, luciferase and CAT, Figures 4&5). Thus, our work indicates that a change in a few amino acids of SARS-CoV nsp1 was sufficient to substantially increase its overall IFN antagonism, which may lead to increase virulence. Comparable mutations may occasionally emerge in other human coronaviruses and lead to increased virulence, before selective pressure eventually eliminates such mutants. Other mutations tested decreased SARS-CoV nsp1 IFN antagonism and such mutations may have been part of SARS-CoV adaptation to the human population had it not been eradicated by public health measures.",
