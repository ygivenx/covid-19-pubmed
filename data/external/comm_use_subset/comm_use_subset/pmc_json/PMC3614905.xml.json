The outcome of host-virus interactions rests on a delicate balance between the host's defenses and the damage caused by viruses [1]. In addition, viruses have developed counter-adaptation strategies to escape immune defenses by evading, suppressing or manipulating the host's immune response. Consequently, favorable genetic traits in both hosts and viruses have been naturally selected over time [2].",

            "text": "Human mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a prototypic soluble calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin, is a key first line host defense molecule and immune regulator. MBL collaborates with a network of host defenses such as complement components and diverse cellular receptors such as C-type lectin, scavenger, and complement receptors, integrins, and Toll-like receptors (TLR) to prime long-lived adaptive immunity [3], [4]. MBL recognizes specific molecular patterns of oligosaccharides including D-mannose, L-fucose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine that decorate the surface of many viruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV), Hendra and Nipah viruses, HIV-1, HIV-2, influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [5], [6]. MBL oligomers form complexes with MBL-associated serine protease (MASP) dimers which activate the lectin complement pathway and enhance opsonophagocytosis of pathogens [5]. The average human MBL serum concentration is 1.5 \u00b5g/ml (range, 0 to >5 \u00b5g/ml) [7] but up to 30% of the human population has levels <500 ng/ml, which may be associated with increased susceptibility to infections in young children and immunocompromised individuals [5]. Interindividual variability of MBL concentrations is caused by structural variant alleles (B, C, and D) in exon 1 of the MBL2 gene which disrupt assembly of MBL high-order oligomers and lead to reduced MBL concentrations and activity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region (H/L, X/Y), 5\u2032 untranslated region (P/Q) and other regulatory sites also modify serum concentrations. Together, these sequence variations define at least 7 common human MBL haplotypes that dictate MBL concentrations and complement-activating capacity. MBL variant alleles are present in approximately 20% to 50% of individuals. Higher rates occur in indigenous people from Africa and South America [8]. The reason for such high rates of sequence variations is an unresolved controversy [9], [10]. It has been postulated that a high-producing ancestral haplotype (A allele) evolved into multiple low MBL-producing haplotypes because of heterotic balanced selection in which individuals carrying structural and regulatory heterozygous polymorphisms had a survival advantage [11]. It is not known whether viral infections exerted such selective pressure over time.",

Its highly glycosylated viral envelope glycoprotein (GP1,2) mediates receptor binding (GP1) and virus-host cell membrane fusion (GP2) by targeting ubiquitous lectins and other molecules expressed by macrophages, dendritic cells and endothelial cells [12], [13]. We previously demonstrated that recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) binds EBOV GP1,2 (referred to as GP) lentiviral virion-like particles and wild-type-like EBOV in a specific and dose-dependent manner [6], [14]. Treatment of mice infected with 3,000\u00d7LD50 native EBOV using supraphysiological dosages of rhMBL had a protective effect which required intact complement component 3 (C3) function [15]. Taken together, these data suggested that MBL and the lectin complement pathway can influence the course of EBOV infections.",

            "text": "Viruses infect cells by co-opting existing cellular structures or functions that are responsible for endocytosis of fluid and small particles, cell-cell recognition, ion transport, and binding to the extracellular matrix. First, viruses bind to attachment factors and/or cognate receptors which help concentrate the virus on the cell surface. Upon binding, receptors then promote endocytosis or trigger direct fusion of viral and host cell-membranes [16]. EBOV is internalized primarily by macropinocytosis [17] whereas certain other viruses enter cells via clathrin-coated pits, caveolar/lipid-raft structures, or clathrin\u2212 and caveolin/raft-independent mechanisms [16]. In general, the specificity of receptor binding determines cell tropism, and the type of receptor engaged by the virus determines the choice of endocytic pathway. Notably, EBOV has very broad cell tropism, especially later in the course of infection, and it may bind to multiple attachment factors, notable among which are numerous lectins (DC-SIGN/L-SIGN, MGL [CLEC10A], LSECtin [CLEC4G]) and Niemann-Pick C1 endosomal membrane protein. In addition, Tyro3 family members (Axl, Dtk, Mer) and \u03b21 integrins which are widely expressed have been implicated in Ebola-GP mediated cell entry [13], [18]. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) was recently proposed as an epithelial receptor that binds the EBOV GP1 receptor binding region [19] but the cognate receptor(s) of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells have yet to be identified.",

This process, called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), starts with cross-linking of virus-antibody or virus-antibody-complement complexes to Fc\u03b3 (CD32) or complement receptors, respectively [20], [21], [23]. The virus may then be coupled to its cognate receptor on the cell surface, thereby facilitating entry. It is noteworthy that viral specific antibodies can either neutralize or enhance productive EBOV and WNV infection depending on the antibody concentration and class, complement component concentration, type of cells, density of epitopes, and effector mechanisms mediated by the crystallizable fragment (Fc) of the antibody [22], [24], [25]. It has also been postulated that the rapid spread of EBOV to secondary target cells (e.g. hepatocytes and endothelial cells) occurs by means of ADE via widely distributed C1q receptors [22].",

In addition, MBL has structural and functional homology with C1q which binds cognate cellular receptors and/or activates the complement pathway via actions of serine proteases [28]. Given the functional similarities between MBL and either antibodies or C1q, we considered that a novel MBL receptor-mediated mechanism for enhancing infection by EBOV and other viruses whose virions are highly glycosylated might explain some of the heterotic balanced selection that may contribute to the evolutionary divergence of human MBL haplotypes.",

THP-1 cells (5\u00d7104/100 \u00b5l), stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) and supplemented with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) to upregulate potential EBOV receptors [39], became differentiated and adherent after 72 hours of incubation in RPMI 1640 (2.5% FBS). Monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared and maintained as described above. The inoculum consisted of 1200 pg p24/100 \u00b5l for each viral construct unless indicated otherwise. 1200 pg HIV p24 corresponds approximately to 2\u00d7107 HIV-EBOZ GP virion-like particles according to the formula: p24 mass \u00d7 (1 mol/MW p24 [24,000 g/mol]) \u00d7 (6.02\u00d71023 molecules/1 mol) \u00d7 (1 virion/2000 molecules). Based on these calculations, the estimated virion-like particle to cell ratio (approximation to MOI) for HEK293F and HEK293S cells was 800\u22361, and 400\u22361 for THP-1 cells. Before infecting cells, the sera, virion-like particles and/or cells were prepared as follows: 1) MBL-replete or \u2013deficient (LYPB/LYPB; MBL <0.6 ng/ml) sera were preincubated with dilutions of oligosaccharides, mannan, polyethylene glycol, EDTA, 3F8 or isotypic control IgG1 at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes, 2) virion-like particles were preincubated with dilutions of human sera (pretreated as above for certain experiments), rhMBL, cyanovirin-N, PNGase F, endo H, thermolysin or serum-free media at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, or 3) cells were preincubated with dilutions of pharmacologic inhibitors of endocytosis at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, or N-glycosylation inhibitors at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours, and appropriate controls (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] or methanol for endocytosis inhibitors). Reagents were diluted in DMEM or Veronal-buffered saline (VBS, barbital 2.5 mM, sodium barbital 1.5 mM, NaCl 0.14 M) to achieve optimal rates of infection. The final CaCl2 concentration was 5 mM unless indicated otherwise. Media were removed from the cells (except for the media containing pharmacologic inhibitors of endocytosis), and the inoculum preparation was added. Of note, cells preincubated with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before virus was added to obviate disruption of virion glycans or envelopes. Microplates were centrifuged at 1000\u00d7g for 2 hours at room temperature (spinoculation step), and then incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 3 hours.

In the course of those experiments, we were not surprised to confirm that complement was essential for the inhibitory effects of rhMBL. In its absence, we found preliminary evidence suggesting a paradoxical rhMBL-dependent increase in EBOV infection in a variety of human cell lines including 293F cells, which produced highly reproducible results and which potentially bind the EBOV receptor binding region to a greater extent than 293 T cells [48]. Given the wealth of examples where viruses subvert immune defense molecules during virus entry and given the evidence for selective pressure against high-producing MBL haplotypes in human populations, we sought to define the mechanisms by which MBL might enhance infection of human cells by EBOV. We also evaluated the effects of MBL on infection by other glycosylated viruses in low complement states to determine whether this mechanism was relevant for glycosylated viruses in general.",

MBL forms a complex with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and upon binding to pathogens, MBL-MASPs sequentially cleave complement components C4 and C2. The catalytic products of these complement components form the C4b2a complex which acts as the C3 convertase, a key enzyme in the lectin complement pathway. Cleavage and processing of C3 by the C3 convertase produces several C3-derived components (e.g. iC3b) that are potent activators of the immune system. iC3b binds complement receptor 3 (CR3) leading to enhanced phagocytosis by professional phagocytes and increased cytotoxicity by NK cells. Based on the fact that complement is heat labile, we showed that heat inactivation of serum reversed its inhibitory effect on viral infection at higher serum concentrations, which contained higher native MBL levels, albeit to varying extents (Figure 1E). To further define the critical contribution of complement, we compared the effects of human sera from which C2 was removed by immune precipitation and that contained or lacked native MBL (Figure 1F). Notably, C2-depleted MBL-replete serum enhanced infection maximally at a 50% dilution at which MBL's concentration was greatest, an effect that could be reversed by supplementation with recombinant human C2. Complement-replete serum with or without native MBL did not augment infection (Figure 1F).",

Unlike PNGase F, endo H leaves a single GlcNAc residue which is a potential binding site for MBL (Figure 3A, B). First, we confirmed that the endoglycosidases did in fact remove high-mannose moieties from GP of endoglycosidase-treated HIV-EBOV viruses. We proved this with a western blot using biotinylated Hippeastrum hybrid (amaryllis) lectin to detect \u03b1-mannose residues (the hybrid lectin does not bind to \u03b1-glucosyl structures); high-mannose was present in substantial quantities only in untreated, non-deglycosylated virus (Figure S3). We found that PNGase F inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of rhMBL (Figure 3C), whereas heat-inactivated PNGase F did not inhibit infection (Figure 3D). In contrast to this effect, neither active nor heat-inactivated endo H inhibited infection (Figure 3C, D).",

Preincubation of cells with 1-deoxynojirimicin and swainsonine, which block carbohydrate trimming by inhibiting glucosidase I-II and \u03b1-mannosidase II [52] also reduced MBL-mediated infection albeit to a lesser extent than tunicamycin, relative to the control in which MBL enhanced viral uptake by 18-fold (Figure 3E). These chemical inhibitors are potentially cytotoxic but we accounted for differences in cell viability by means of cell proliferation assays (alamarBlue resazurin reduction assays). Similarly, MBL-mediated enhanced infection was not seen in HEK293S cells that are genetically deficient in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (Figure 3F).",

Amiloride hydrochloride, which also inhibits macropinocytosis, produced similar results (Figure S5). The absence of a differential effect of methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin likewise suggested that lipid rafts were required for viral infection regardless of the presence of MBL (Figure 4B).

We then infected cells with HIV-EBOV GP in quadruplicate in the presence or absence of rhMBL. In the first instance, five different shRNAs targeting the endosomal protease, CTSL1 (Figure S6) reduced infections by 22\u201399% in the presence or absence of MBL, which lent credence to the validity of our assay because proteolysis of EBOV GP by cathepsin-L in the host cell endosome is a critical step for viral entry [45], [51]. The RNAi Consortium at the Broad Institute previously validated the specificity of all five cathepsin-L shRNAs with gene transcription assays (S. Silver, personal communication). We did not perform a western blot to validate reduced protein expression. We then proceeded to demonstrate that knockdown of MGL (CLEC10A) reduced infections by 47\u201388% (Figure S6). We verified knockdown of MGL gene expression by measuring mRNA transcripts relative to non-targeting shRNA controls and demonstrated variable reductions of 15%, >95% and 55% for MGL shRNA constructs 2, 3 and 4, respectively (Figure S6; Methods S1). However, in our hands, there were no significant differences in protein expression compared with an empty pLK0.1 control vector (data not shown). We also found a 70% reduction in infection of cells treated with one TYRO3 shRNA which reduced gene expression by 62% but did not reduce protein expression (data not shown).

As seen for pseudotyped viruses, MBL-dependent enhanced infection was blocked by preincubating rhMBL with mannan (Figure S7) or pretreatment of cells with tunicamycin in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S7). To evaluate the generalizeability of our observations for other glycosylated viruses, we tested three additional native viral infection models. RhMBL enhanced native Nipah and Hendra viral infections in hypocomplementemic conditions by 20 to 35%, respectively (Figure 7B). In addition, rhMBL significantly enhanced West Nile virion-like particle transduction by 150 to 300% in low complement conditions but it had no effect on a glycosylation-deficient WNV N154Q mutant strain (Figure 7C).",

Since MBL deficiency was first discovered as a cause of a common opsonic defect in children [56], a better understanding of its diverse functions has evolved [5]. MBL binds to invariant glycans on diverse microorganisms including EBOV [6], [14], upregulates opsonophagocytosis, activates the lectin complement pathway, amplifies host responses in cooperation with TLR2/6, and differentially regulates cytokine production [4], [57], [58]. Yet, a cogent explanation for the evolutionary selection of low-producing MBL haplotypes, particularly in indigenous Africans and South Americans, is lacking [9], [10], [59]. We describe for the first time that MBL enhances EBOV, WNV infections, and to a lesser extent Hendra and Nipah viruses in low complement conditions. These findings suggest that certain infectious diseases may have negatively selected high-producing MBL genotypes and they provide new insights in EBOV pathogenesis.",

Based on the repertoire of MBL's typical ligands, we hypothesized that the targets were glycoproteins, which are critical for virus stability, cell tropism, immune evasion, and host cell invasion. EBOV, and other viruses such as Hendra and Nipah viruses, WNV, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1, HIV-2, influenza viruses, metapneumoviruses, and SARS-corona virus use host cell machinery to modify viral surface proteins by N-linked glycosylation. This process involves attaching a high-mannose core to the amide nitrogen of asparagines followed by trimming and remodeling of viral oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus [60]. EBOV GPs are heavily glycosylated with N- and O-linked glycans that constitute more than one-third of their molecular mass [61]. The majority of N-linked glycans are concentrated in the GP1 glycan cap and mucin-like region, which are reminiscent of the glycan shields of HIV gp120 and Epstein-Barr virus gp350. Other investigators have speculated that glycans may help EBOV evade immune responses by masking the putative EBOV receptor-binding region [62], [63]. But viral glycans may also be recognized by C-type lectin receptors that are either membrane-associated (e.g. DC-SIGN [42]) or soluble (e.g. MBL [6]), and several viruses can hijack these type of molecules to enter cells and propagate [60].",

These findings were confirmed by the fact that MBL-mediated enhancement of viral infection was abrogated by thermolysin-treated HIV-EBOV GP virions in a thermolysin-concentration dependent manner (Figure S4). MBL also had a significantly reduced capacity to enhance EBOV infection when the GP lacked a portion of the glycosylated mucin-rich region (Figure 1B). It is noteworthy, however, that infection levels of EBOV with mutated GP were higher than those of wild-type GP pseudotypes, likely because absence of the GP's mucin-rich region exposed the putative EBOV receptor binding region which facilitated infection of cells [33]. On the other hand, MBL did not enhance infection by VSV-G pseudotyped virions indicating to some extent MBL's selectivity.",

It is known that EBOV protects itself from host immunity by down-regulating host proteins including immune regulatory molecules and receptors such as MHC1 and \u03b21 integrins via steric occlusion, referred to as the \u201cglycan umbrella\u201d effect [50], [65]. To circumvent this constraint on infection, we propose that EBOV may exploit putative MBL receptors to enter cells with or without engaging EBOV-specific receptors. Although the cognate receptor/s for MBL are not known with certainty, potential receptors for MBL include CD93 (C1qRp), CD35 (complement receptor 1, CR1), calreticulin (cC1qR), CD91, and the binding protein for the globular domain of C1q (gC1qBP/gC1qR/C1QBP) [4], [28], all of which have proven and/or predicted N-linked glycopeptides [66], [67]. Therefore, we tested whether reduction of N-linked glycoprotein receptor expression [68] by chemical (tunicamycin) or genetic (HEK293S GnTI\u2212 cells) approaches could reduce MBL-mediated HIV-EBOV GP infection. Tunicamycin, which completely inhibits N-linked glycosylation, abrogated MBL-mediated pseudotyped EBOV infection to a greater extent than other downstream N-glycan-trimming agents such as deoxynojirimycin and swainsonine which leave residual mannose or GlcNAc residues (Figure 3E). Similarly, HEK293S N-linked glycosylation-deficient cells were resistant to MBL-mediated enhancement (Figure 3F). Taken together, these results showed that MBL interacts with N-linked glycoproteins trafficked via the ER and Golgi apparatus. This finding is corroborated by the fact that the collagenous stalk of MBL binds to calreticulin, a putative receptor [27] and lung collectins (surfactant proteins A and D) can also bind ligands via their collagenous tails [69].",

EBOV attaches to various putative attachment factors on the cell surface [13] where they undergo either clathrin/caveolae/dynamin-independent, actin/lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis-like endocytosis [17], [70], [74] or clathrin/caveolae/dynamin-dependent endocytosis [75] depending on type of target cells involved. Virions are then trafficked through early and late endosomes where they undergo proteolysis in acidified endocytic vesicles by cathepsin L and/or B which remove the mucin-like region of GP leading to enhanced viral binding and infectivity [17], [19], [33], [45], [46], [47], [70]. Previous studies used replication-competent infectious EBOV, EBOV virion-like particles or pseudotyped lentiviruses. Findings from our infection assay using EBOV GP pseudotyped lentiviruses agreed with those of Saeed et al., who used wild type viruses, to the extent that EBOV undergoes macropinocytosis-like endocytosis (Figure 4A) in a lipid raft-dependent (Figure 4B) and dynamin-independent (Figure S5) manner [17], [74]. In addition, we found that MBL diminished the dependence on actin filaments (but not microtubules) and early endosomal acidification [70], [76] for infection (Figure 4C-F, Figure S5), suggesting that MBL may traffic viruses via a non-canonical pathway that resembles the clathrin/caveolin/dynamin/actin-independent, and microtubule-dependent endocytic pathway utilized by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and recombinant LCMV-Lassa virus GP infectious virions [77]. Further detailed mechanistic studies are required to confirm these findings.",

We conducted an RNAi screen using at least 4 unique shRNA-expressing vectors per gene to mitigate the impact of differential effectiveness and possibility of off-target effects of shRNAs [40]. We tested our assay by comparing levels of HIV-EBOV GP infection after knocking down CTSL1 (Figure S6)[47] and the reduced infectivity was consistent with the known role of CTSL1 in mediating viral entry. Using the same techniques, we revealed that knock down of C1QBP by three shRNA constructs (confirmed by western blot, Figure 6D) reduced HIV-EBOV GP infection to variable extents in two of the three shRNA treatments (variability of shRNAs is well described). Notably, knock down of C1QBP by both shRNAs was augmented in the presence of MBL but to a significantly greater extent for the most effective shRNA (65% to 90% reduction of infection, p<0.005) suggesting that MBL plays a supplementary role in mediating viral entry (Figure 6C, D). C1QBP is a tetrameric transmembrane surface protein expressed on human monocytes and a variety of other cells. It binds the globular heads of C1q via its amino terminus with high affinity and contains three potential N-glycosylation sites [78]. C1QBP has been implicated in innate and adaptive immunity. Viral ligands have been shown to activate C1QBP translocation which inhibits RIG-1, an RNA helicase, which in turn inhibits antiviral signaling by downregulating type I interferons [79]. Given that induction of RIG-1 inhibits EBOV replication [80] we speculate that EBOV-MBL complexes activate C1QBP which then negatively regulates RIG-1 inhibition of viral infection, thereby enhancing viral proliferation. However, it is not clear how C1QBP avoids binding to circulating MBL under normal physiological conditions. One hypothesis is that MBL undergoes a conformational change upon binding to viral and other targets [81]. This in turn could expose potential binding sites in MBL's collagenous stalk for engagement with C1QBP.",

As expected, MBL-enhancement of EBOV infection was mitigated by mannan and tunicamycin (Figure S7) and infection with a WNV glycosylation mutant was not enhanced by MBL (Figure 7C).

Tobin et al. [87] identified mutations in zebrafish and human leukotriene A4 hydrolase genes that conferred heterozygous advantage against Mycobacterium marinum and tuberculosis, respectively. These results set a groundbreaking precedent in our understanding of how SNPs in a single human gene can dictate dichotomous inflammatory states: either inadequate or excessive immune responses can result in increased severity of TB meningitis in humans. Similarly, we speculate that under certain circumstances both high and low levels of MBL may predispose individuals to certain infectious diseases. Furthermore, our hypothesis that high levels of MBL may be deleterious is supported conceptually by a recent report that demonstrated a role for MBL in mediating immune pathology in a mouse model of Ross River virus (RRV) arthritis; high MBL levels in serum and synovial fluid of humans with RRV correlated with disease severity [88]. MBL has also been implicated in murine models of pandemic H1N1 influenza A and H9N2 avian influenza A as a risk factor for severe disease by upregulating inflammatory responses [89]. There is also evidence that inhibition of the lectin pathway confers considerable protection against non-infectious disorders such myocardial and gastrointestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury [90]. Therefore, it is possible that evolutionary selection of mutant MBL alleles conferred protection against a variety of pathogens and/or reduced the deleterious effects of complement-mediated inflammation [8], [11], [83], [84], [85]. Other examples of preserved heterozygozity include sickle-cell trait which protects against malaria despite its disadvantage in healthy populations. Also, a persistent regulatory mutation in the Duffy antigen chemokine receptor confers resistance to malaria.",

            "text": "Wide variations in plasma concentrations of MBL and certain complement components occur naturally. These variations are due to diversity of genotypes of MBL and complement component C4, which is encoded by 2 to 8 copies of the C4 gene [91], as well as other complement components. Partial C4 deficiency is one of the most common immune protein deficiencies in humans. It is caused by a complex pattern of differences in gene size, gene number, and nucleotide polymorphisms. Specifically, homoexpression or deletion of C4A or C4B is estimated to occur in 19\u201334% of normal Caucasians [92], [93]. Total C4A deficiency occurs in 1% and C4B deficiency in 10% of the Finnish population [94]. The mean C4 protein levels vary between 0.26 and 0.49 g/L in European Americans and Asian Indian populations [93], [95]. However, it is notable that total C4 protein levels span a 1-log range (approximately 0.1 to 1.0 g/L) with higher concentrations correlating with a larger number of gene copies [93], [95]. Although the prevalence of homozygous C2 deficiency in Caucasians is rare (approximately 1/20,000), partial C2 deficiency is estimated to affect about 1% of western Europeans [96]. In addition, certain infectious diseases may modulate complement levels e.g. acute malaria is a pervasive ancient infectious disease that can cause hypocomplementemia [97], [98]. Furthermore, complement may be reduced to varying extents by certain auto-immune conditions that drive immune complex formation, although these events are relatively rare. To investigate our hypothesis that relatively low levels of complement may permit MBL to enhance viral infection, we performed infection assays in serially diluted serum. We observed that serum containing higher concentrations of native MBL enhanced HIV-EBOV GP infection to the greatest extent when serum was diluted by at least 10-fold (Figure 1C). We then showed that the critical factor in serum (diluted only 2-fold) that abrogated MBL's capacity to enhance infection is complement (specifically C2; Figure 1F). It is in this context that we modeled viral infections using high level rhMBL (10 \u00b5g/ml) in 5% serum (i.e. diluted 20-fold). However, such a high concentration of rhMBL is considered supraphysiological if adjusted for the 20-fold dilution factor of serum.",

It is possible that MBL2 expression can be differentially induced in various compartments in response to different stimuli [99]. Similarly, extrahepatic complement synthesis and regulation may influence local concentrations of complement [100]. Furthermore, dysfunctional MASP-2 variants may attenuate its capacity to activate complement [101]. The frequency of deficient or non-functional MASP-2 ranges from 2% to 19% in different populations with the highest values in Africans [102]. We speculate that relative MBL excess in the setting of relatively low C4 levels or deficient MASP-2 may lead to MBL-mediated enhanced viral infections in clinical settings. Thus, we propose that MBL, C4 and MASP-2, among others contribute to a lattice of immune molecules that represent an individual's \u201cinnate immune haplotype\u201d. Individually, these effectors may not necessarily dictate the outcome of infections, but the aggregate immunological state may influence a person's susceptibility or resistance to infection.",

Therefore, the observed interactions between HIV-EBOV-GP and host attachment factors may be artificial. However, we showed a similar phenomenon with wild type-like EBOV and other glycosylated viruses. Furthermore, it has been shown that all the GPs of all the Ebolaviruses (EBOV and relatives) contain high-mannose and hybrid N-linked glycans independent of the cell line used for viral propagation [64]. Another limitation of our study was the lack of direct evidence from humans that complement components (specifically C4 or C2) are sufficiently low in vivo in certain circumstances to permit MBL to mediate enhanced uptake of glycosylated viruses. We used media supplemented with 5% human serum which is only half the concentration of fetal calf or fetal bovine serum typically used for EBOV infectivity assays [17], [18], [44], [45], [67]. Given that C4 gene copy number variations may lead to a proportionate reduction of circulating C4 [88], we speculate that the experimental ratios of MBL:C4 used in this study are physiologically plausible. A recent clinical study by Kainulainen et al. [94] provided preliminary data which are consistent with our hypothesis that synergy between C4 deficiency and MBL excess may predispose children and adolescents to certain infections: 26% (n = 22) of Finnish patients with recurrent respiratory infections vs.14% (n = 10) of healthy controls (p = 0.048) had C4A deficiency. Not unexpectedly, 50% of the patients with C4A deficiency had MBL concentrations >1.5 \u00b5g/ml, the mean human MBL serum concentration but notably, more than one-third had very high MBL levels (>4 \u00b5g/ml). Further clinical studies are required to investigate the significance of this apparent association.",

MBL, which is a key innate immune molecule, seemingly has paradoxical functions depending on the levels of complement [6], [15]. We demonstrate for the first time the phenomenon of MBL-dependent enhancement of infections caused by glycosylated virions in low complement conditions and discover roles for C1QBP and dectin-2 in EBOV pathogenesis. We postulate that an individual's innate immune haplotype is defined by the interactions between the genotypes of MBL, C4 and possibly others. Our findings highlight the possibility that administration of supraphysiological doses of MBL products or blood products with high MBL concentrations to individuals in the setting of infectious diseases and relative hypocomplementemia may be deleterious under certain conditions. On the other hand, it is intriguing to consider that MBL might be used as an adjuvant to enhance delivery of glycosylated vaccine epitopes to effectors of the immune system. Finally, these findings suggest that the pressure of infectious diseases may have driven, in part, the evolutionary selection of MBL mutant haplotypes that encode low or intermediate MBL serum levels in the majority of humans.",
