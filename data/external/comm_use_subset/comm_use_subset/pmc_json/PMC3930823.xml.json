The genome is about 11 kb in length and encodes three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Neutralizing antibody is predominantly induced against E protein, and laboratory and clinical studies have demonstrated that protection of animals or individuals from DENV infection is best correlated to titer of neutralizing antibody (>1:10). However, pre-existing sub-neutralizing concentration of antibody or non-neutralizing antibody was also evidenced to enhance DENV infection in Fc gamma Receptor (Fc\u03b3R) - positive cells and appears to be a risk factor for severe diseases. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) infection [5,6]. Thus, human antibodies are believed to play distinct roles in controlling DENV infection. It is important to characterize antibody with neutralizing or enhancing activities against DENV for both basic and applied research.",

Standard PRNT was performed in 12-well plates using 10-fold dilution of each mAb. The results showed that all three mAbs significantly reduced the numbers of plaques in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1,ABC, right ordinate). The PRNT50 of 4G2, 2B8 and 2A10G6 was 8.55, 0.45 and 0.35 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The RLU based assay was performed in the 12-well plate using the same dilutions of each mAb. The results demonstrated that all three mAbs significantly decreased RLU in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1, ABC, left ordinate). LRNT50 of three mAbs calculated from a fitting curve were 6.80, 0.86 and 0.26 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, which was of the same order of magnitude with PRNT50. An unrelated mAb against EV71 showed no neutralization for both plaque and Luc-based assay (data not shown). Data fitting was made between values above. As expected, a linear correlation (R2 > 0.95) was demonstrated between PFU and RLU assay, and the linear equation between RLU and PFU is calculated as RLU = 86.74 PFU + 2256 (Figure 1D). Our results supported the application of Luc-based assay for neutralization antibodies against DENV.",

As shown in Figure 5, all three samples were able to enhance DENV infection at dilutions from 2 \u00d7 10-2 to10-4 (#19-20), 10-2 to10-5 (#37-20), and 10-1 to10-4 (#37-30), respectively. Negative control (#NC) from healthy adult in varying dilutions showed no impact on RLU as expected. Meanwhile, serum #19-20 and #37-20 showed strong neutralizing activities at a dilution of 10-2 or even lower, and LRNT50 was calculated to 80 and 10-fold dilution separately, whereas no neutralizing activity can be observed in serum #37-30 at detected dilutions. Together, these results indicate that the Luc-based assay is suitable for detecting both neutralization and ADE activity of immune sera from vaccinated or infected individuals.",

            "text": "A reliable, rapid, and high-throughput assay for DENV neutralization antibodies is critical for laboratory and clinical studies of DENV infection and vaccine. Considering the limitations of plaque based assay, some novel methods for neutralizing assays have been described [12-18]. Che and coworkers recently developed a novel ELISPOT based neutralization test, demonstrating a well correlation with the conventional PRNT assay [19]. Pseudo infectious DENV reporter virus particles (RVP) carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter were also used to measure neutralization antibodies with rapidity, stability and reproducibility [15,16,20]. Infection with RVP could be monitored by the GFP signals using flow cytometry. However, GFP is not suitable for real-time quantification, and production of RVP requires special cell lines and replicon based plasmids. Live reporter virus carrying luciferase reporter replicates almost the same as wild type virus, representing a more advanced tool. Many reporter viruses, including SARS-related corona virus, human hepatitis C virus, parainfluenza virus, HIV, adenovirus, have been described and well applied for antiviral screening, live imaging, or function studies [21-25]. Live reporter DENV engineering a reporter gene at the capsid gene has been developed [26]. Recently, we described the stable luciferase DENV reporter virus Luc-DENV and used it for high-throughput screening for antiviral drugs [9]. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of Luc-DENV for measuring neutralization and enhancing antibodies. Using three identified neutralizing mAbs, Luc-based assay showed well correlation with the PRNT-based assay. 4G2 and 2B8 are both IgG1 isotype mAbs, and 2A10G6 belongs to IgG2a isotype. 2B8 recognizes the domain III of DENV E protein and inhibit viral binding, while 2A10G6 and 4G2 inhibit fusion. All three mAbs were active in inhibiting plaque forming and Luc expression in Luc-DNEV infected Vero cells. The value of PRNT50 and LRNT50 are well correlated (R2 > 0.95). The Luc-based assay was readily applied in evaluation of clinical samples from vaccinated animals and infected patients.",

Linear correlation was established between the two assays for both neutralization and ADE assays (Figure 1D and Figure 2B). The newly developed assay method is comparable to the traditional plaque assay, with some unique advantages. First, this Luc-based assay is more substantial and time saving. The conventional plaque test used 12-well plates and 5\u20137 days observation for the plaque forming, the new test is compared performing the same protocol involved 24-well plates and cost no more than 2 days. Second, this new assay method has a more wide-range scope of application with high repetitiveness and reliability. Luc-DENV replicates well in multiple cells including BHK-21, K562, Vero and THP-1 and A549 cells, and luciferase activity can also be detected stably in various cells. Neutralization and ADE assays can be performed in the same cells [34]. Third, this new assay method is easy to adapt for a high-throughput manner [9], which is of critical importance for large-scale clinical samples assays during clinical trials of dengue vaccine.",
