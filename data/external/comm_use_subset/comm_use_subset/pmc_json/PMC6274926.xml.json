The highly pathogenic PEDV variants first appeared in October 2010 in China, during an outbreak characterized by high mortality rates among suckling piglets [2]. PEDV later spread to the United States and other countries, resulting in significant economic losses in the swine industry. PEDV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of ~28 kb in length and containing a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail [3]. PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the Coronavirus family, and encodes two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1a/b) that, upon further processing, result in 16 nonstructural proteins, including an accessory protein (ORF3) and four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N).",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~23 nt), noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by degrading mRNAs and/or inhibiting translation [4]. Mammalian miRNAs target mRNAs primarily by pairing with cis-regulatory sites in the 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) to direct their posttranscriptional repression [5], with an important target motif identified as a ~7-nt site that matches the seed region of the miRNA [6]. By base pairing to mRNAs, miRNAs mediate translational repression or mRNA degradation to control mRNA stability and translation [7]. During host\u2013virus interactions, miRNAs also play important regulatory roles by inhibiting viral replication through the direct targeting of viral genomic RNA [8,9]. Increasing evidence shows that miRNAs regulate innate immune responses in response to viral infection. miR-146 acts as a negative regulatory loop of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-signaling pathway by targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6 and interleukin (IL)-1-receptor-associated kinase 1 [10]. Additionally, miR-21 is regulated by the signal transducer and an activator of transcription (STAT)3 pathway, and activates the NF-\u03baB pathway by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog [11]. Moreover, miR-302c represses NF-\u03baB expression by directly targeting the 3\u2032 UTR of NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) [12].",

Induction of type I IFN converges with the activation of TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB-activator-binding kinase 1/I\u03baB kinase (IKK)i, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, and mitogen-activated protein kinases which, in turn, promote the phosphorylation and activation of IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)3, NF-\u03baB, and activating protein (AP)-1, respectively. For NF-\u03baB activation, PRRs initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the IKK phosphorylation, which subsequently phosphorylates and ubiquitinates I\u03baB-\u03b1 bound to NF-\u03baB in resting cells, and results in I\u03baB-\u03b1 proteasomal degradation, thereby allowing NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation to transcriptionally activate its gene targets [15]. Excessive activation of innate immunity is a hallmark of serious diseases; therefore, organisms have evolved mechanisms to negatively modulate the pathway. I\u03baB negatively regulates the NF-\u03baB pathway by binding to NF-\u03baB, resulting in its sequestration in the cytoplasm. Additionally, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a negative regulator of Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling [16], and also binds to p65 in the nucleus and acts a ubiquitin ligase to limit prolonged p65-mediated signaling [17].",

Mature miRNA is part of an active RNA-induced silencing complex capable of directly binding viral genomic RNA to promote its recognition and degradation [35]. Previous studies reported that miR-181 and miR-23 directly target viral genomic RNA to inhibit porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus replication [8,36], and miR-32 targets the primate foamy virus genome to suppress viral replication [30]. Additionally, several IFN-induced miRNAs (miR-196, miR-296, miR-351, miR-431, and miR-448) target the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome to inhibit HCV replication [37]. However, some miRNAs reportedly promote viral replication, including miR-122, which promotes HCV RNA accumulation by binding to HCV genomic RNA to stimulate its translation [38]. In the present study, we showed that miR-221-5p inhibited PEDV replication by targeting highly conserved regions in viral genomic RNA (Figure 4). Our findings that blockage of endogenous miR-221-5p significantly increased PEDV infection (Figure 2 and Figure 3) demonstrated that miR-221-5p inhibited PEDV replication by binding to viral genomic RNA.",

            "text": "miRNAs indirectly modulate host factors to influence the viral lifecycle. Since innate immunity is an essential defense mechanism against viral invasion, it is possible that miRNAs are involved in the IFN response or the NF-\u03baB activation, which represent critical aspects of signaling pathways associated with innate immunity [39,40,41,42]. A previous study showed that miR-26a, miR-34a, miR-145, and let-7b regulate IFN-\u03b2 expression during viral infection via a negative feedback loop [43]. In the present study, we predicted that miR-221-5p target genes were associated with the TLR- and NF-\u03baB-signaling pathways. In human colorectal cancer cells, miR-221 acts in a positive feedback loop to maintain continuous activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway [44]. These findings suggested a role for miR-221-5p in regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway to alter PEDV replication. Our results showed that miR-221-5p upregulated the expression of the IFNs and ISGs through the NF-\u03baB pathway by downregulating I\u03baB levels to promote p65 nuclear translocation. Moreover, we demonstrated that miR-221-5p bound the 3\u2032 UTR of SOCS1, an inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB pathway and negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway [16,20]. A recent study reported that SOCS1 binds the NF-\u03baB component p65 in the nucleus as a ubiquitin ligase in order to promote p65 degradation, limit prolonged p65-mediated signaling, and terminate the expression of NF-\u03baB-inducible genes [17]. In the present study, we confirmed that SOCS1 overexpression significantly downregulated IFN-\u03b2 levels, whereas SOCS1 silencing markedly upregulated IFN-\u03b2 expression. These findings suggested that miR-221-5p activated the NF-\u03baB pathway to suppress PEDV replication.",
