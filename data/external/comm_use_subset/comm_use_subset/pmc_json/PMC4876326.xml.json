A subset of these genomes was used to infer a maximum likelihood phylogeny using only the G gene coding sequence, and a similar topology was obtained (Fig. S2). The 71 study genomes segregated into three separate clades: BA RSV-B (seven genomes), GA5 RSV-A (five genomes), and GA2 RSV-A (59 genomes). Recent isolates of the RSV-A clade GA2.1 (a continuation of the GA2 clade) were further divided into three monophyletic groups, with 35 genomes representing the genotype ON1, 22 genomes representing a new group of viruses specific to the study samples from Tennessee that we named genotype TN1, and two genomes with sequences proximal to the divergence point of GA2.1, which we have named genotype TN2 in the context of this study. Both TN1 and TN2 genotypes are supported by Bayesian posterior probabilities of 1 and ML bootstrap values between 99\u2013100%.

In addition, Bayesian phylogenies using a subset of available GenBank whole genomes, including genomes sequenced by us, were inferred using each individual RSV gene, as well as using the whole genome; these analyses provided substitution rates similar to those reported in previous studies69 for all RSV genes (Fig. 2). In particular, we observed a high substitution rate and a Bayesian highest posterior density (HPD) interval of substitution within the SH gene of RSV-B, similar to previous reports (Table 2)69. The mean estimates of the times to most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs) for the whole-genome dataset suggest that circulating and historical RSV-A lineages share a common ancestor from around 1951 (95% HPD, 1937\u20131964), and RSV-B likely diverged in 1967 (95% HPD, 1964\u20131970) based on available whole-genome dataset. Comparing RSV-B G gene phylogenies from our whole-genome dataset to the G gene phylogenies that contain more extensive sampling of all available GenBank full G gene sequences (Fig. S3) indicates that the whole-genome dataset is missing diversity that exists within several RSV-B clades.",

The PS and AI scores indicate an overall non-random association of local and global assignments with the phylogenies tested, whereas the MC result indicates the local state is specifically associated with the topologies of the phylogenies tested.

Nearly all of the RSV-A and RSV-B samples have the same N-linked sites (residues 27, 70, 116, 120, and 126) within the F2 domain. However, N-linked glycosylation sequons in the G gene appear to follow a genotype specific pattern, with multiple glycosylation patterns co-circulating simultaneously. Genotype ON1 shows three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites; clades TN1, TN2, and GA5 have five, four, and five sites, respectively (Fig. 3). RSV-B genomes show two different glycosylation patterns. Genotype BA.1 has four glycosylation sites, three of which are consistent with the majority of circulating RSV-B BA.1 genomes. Genotype BA.2 shows a novel RSV-B glycosylation pattern with just one glycosylation site present toward the C-terminal end of the G protein after the G duplication. Similarly, NetOGlyc shows that the O-linked glycosylation patterns for the G protein follow a genotype-specific pattern as well. Seven distinct O-linked patterns are observed in the G protein sequences from our study cohort. Genotype ON1 shows 85 predicted O-linked glycosylation sites, whereas genotype TN1 has 74 and 83 sites (in non-duplicated and duplicated genomes, respectively), genotype TN2 has 74 sites, and genotype GA5 has 72 sites. RSV-B genomes show two different O-linked glycosylation patterns, with 82 sites for genotype BA.1 and 85 sites for genotype BA.2. There were no significant numbers of O-linked glycans predicted for the F protein. Consensus genotype-specific glycosylation patterns were plotted for visual analysis for the G protein (Fig. 3).",

Phylogenetic and sequence analyses of the G sequence duplications suggest that the duplication occurred in a convergent fashion, at separate times in both RSV-A GA2.1 genotypes (ON1 and TN1), as well as in the RSV-B group (Fig. S1). All 35 strains from genotype ON1 contained the C-terminal G sequence duplication, while only four out of 22 TN1 genomes contained the G gene sequence duplication; however, none of the TN2 viruses have any sequence duplication.

Comparing RSV-A to RSV-B, we observed an additional seven indels; two in the G gene, four in the L gene, and one in the SH gene. In addition to these intergroup indels, there were two variant stop sites found in M2-1 between groups.

This is evident from the interleaving of the RSV-A genomes containing the C-terminal G sequence duplication with non-duplicated genomes within the G gene phylogeny, as well as by the divergence dating estimates for the recent GA2.1 strains and the contained genotypes: ON1, TN1, and TN2 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that genotype ON1 diverged first in late 2009 (95% HPD, 2009.0\u20132010.4), followed by genotype TN1 in early 2011 (95% HPD, 2010.4\u20132011.6) (a local Tennessee clade), and finally by genotype TN2 in late 2011 (95% HPD, 2011.4\u20132012.0). Because the latter two genotypes appear to have evolved from a non-duplicated ancestral G gene sequence, genotype TN1 most likely acquired the duplication convergently. This hypothesis is also supported by the minimal overlap in the 95% HPD intervals of divergence time estimates for genotypes ON1 and TN1. Additionally, a Bayesian analysis was performed using BEAST with duplication/no duplication as a trait to provide added support for the convergence hypothesis. The results exclude the possibility of trait reversion and confirm that the duplication evolved convergently in these two genotypes (Fig. S4).",

This is supported by the high posterior probabilities and bootstrap values on the branches leading to these groups of viruses from both the Bayesian and ML trees respectively.

The F protein has a conserved glycosylation pattern across RSV-A and RSV-B viruses and appears to only permit N-linked glycans in the F2 domain. The high degree of conservation in the F1 domain is likely needed to maintain fitness as it is required to retain a functional fusion mechanism, as this protein undergoes a complex conformational change once attachment triggers fusion30.

We observed large 72 nt duplication in the G protein of RSV-A with two stop-variants, and four indels of various sizes with three stop-variants in the RSV-B G protein dataset. The two major duplications likely also indicate that the duplications impart some level of selective advantage for the virus as the duplication appears to have reached fixation in RSV-B genomes and may be moving toward fixation in RSV-A, although improved RSV surveillance/sampling is required to know this for sure. A recent study by Hotard et al. showed an association between the 60 nt G C-terminal sequence duplication in RSV-B and an enhancement of the attachment function of the G protein32. It is possible the 72 nt duplication in RSV-A similarly enhances the G protein, thus providing a selective advantage to duplicated viruses. As previously reported, there may be a mutation in the G gene that primes duplication to occur, making it more likely to happen in a convergent manner. It has been proposed that stem loop structures form in the replicating RNA strand causing the polymerase to pause and reinitiate replication further back on the template15. The apparent observation of this duplication occurring repeatedly in RSV-A of the same length and location supports this proposed mechanism as an explanation for duplication events.",

This apparent poor surveillance supports the need to adopt a whole-genome sequencing approach for future RSV studies. The observation that the local Tennessee genotype, TN1, did not reach global circulation supports this notion, although poor global surveillance of RSV is an alternative explanation. Similarly, at least one RSV-B duplicated genome exists in our dataset from 1996, earlier than the previous first observation in 1999 of 60 nt duplication in the G gene of RSV-B21. It should be noted that the 1996 genome was located in a separate clade from the BA clade where RSV-B duplicated genomes originate, supporting convergence as a mechanism for increased probability of success of these mutations reaching global circulation.",

The pool was diluted appropriately and amplified on Ion Sphere Particles (ISPs) during emulsion PCR on the Ion One Touch 2 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The emulsion was broken, and the pool was cleaned and enriched for template-positive ISPs on the Ion One Touch ES instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent PGM using 316v2 or 318v2 chips (Thermo Fisher Scientific).",

Tagmented DNA was cleaned with the ZR-96 DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research Corporation) and eluted in 25 \u03bcl resuspension buffer. Illumina sequencing adapters and barcodes were added to tagmented DNA via PCR amplification, where 20 \u03bcl tagmented DNA was combined with 7.5 \u03bcl Nextera PCR Master Mix, 2.5 \u03bcl Nextera PCR Primer Cocktail and 2.5 \u03bcl of each index primer (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) for a total volume of 35 \u03bcl per reaction. Thermocycling was performed with 5 cycles of PCR, as per the Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit protocol (3 min at 72 \u00b0C, denaturation for 10 sec at 98 \u00b0C, annealing for 30 sec at 63 \u00b0C and extension for 3 min at 72 \u00b0C) to create a dual-indexed library for each sample. After PCR amplification, 10 \u03bcl of each library was pooled into a 1.5-mL tube, and the pool was cleaned two times with Ampure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) to remove all leftover primers and small DNA fragments. The first cleaning used a 1.2\u00d7 volume of the Ampure reagent, while the second cleaning used a 0.6\u00d7 volume of the Ampure reagent.

To determine if our data exhibited temporal qualities, we performed an exploratory analysis with Path-O-Gen (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/pathogen/). Neighbor joining trees generated with RSV-A-only and RSV-B-only genomes were used to measure root-to-tip divergence using Path-O-Gen, which showed that both RSV datasets contained enough temporal signal to proceed with time-based Bayesian analyses. All Bayesian analyses were performed using BEAST v1.84344 on the CIPRES Science Gateway45. Whole-genome and gene-specific phylogenies were inferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling chains of 100 million to one billion in length, with parameters and trees recorded to ensure 10,000 samples per run. The GTR-IG substitution model was used and tip dating with precision to the sampling year was employed for all trees. All genes were analyzed using a lognormal relaxed clock. Default priors were used for each analysis except for the ucld.mean procedure for which we used the CTMC rate reference prior46. For the G gene analysis, we performed divergence dating on RSV-A by constraining four clades and genotypes most closely related to two separate lineages of viruses with G duplications present. We also performed a trait analysis with BEAST using duplication/no duplication as leaf states to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the duplication trait. All analyses were evaluated with Tracer v1.6 (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) to determine the success of the chain sampling based on effective sample size values for each parameter. Additional chains were run as needed. For each analysis, we constructed a maximum clade credibility tree using TreeAnnotator v1.8.1, available for download with BEAST.",
