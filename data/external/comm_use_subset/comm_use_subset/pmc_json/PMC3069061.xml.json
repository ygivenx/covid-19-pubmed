Mosquito midgut epithelial cell ultrastructures have previously been characterized by electron microscopy in several species, including Aedes aegypti\n[2], [3], [4], [5], Anopheles gambiae\n[6], An. darlingi\n[7], Culex quinquefasciatus\n[8], and Cx. tarsalis\n[9]. One of the most striking findings from these studies was that the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) in midgut epithelial cells of adult female Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes is organized into large whorl-like structures prior to blood feeding. With the onset of feeding, the RER whorls undergo a dramatic reorganization, presumably to facilitate the synthesis and secretion of digestive proteases and components of the peritrophic matrix [2], [3], [5], [7], [10], [11]. Interestingly, male mosquitoes, which do not blood feed, lack RER whorls in their midgut epithelial cells [12]. The identity and functional contribution of protein components localized to mosquito midgut RER whorls have not been investigated.",

Whorl-like smooth ER structures have also been shown to form in mammalian tissue culture cells that over express transfected ER resident proteins or fluorescent protein gene fusions containing heterologous transmembrane domains [15], [16], [17]. Immunofluorescent staining has been used in these transfection experiments to show that weak protein-protein interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of highly abundant ER imbedded proteins are sufficient to induce membrane stacking and whorl formation. The absence of some ER proteins can also induce whorl formation, suggesting that mechanisms are in place to prevent ER whorls from forming in most cell types [18].",

Moreover, an artificial amino acid meal is sufficient to induce translation of early trypsin mRNA using the TOR signaling pathway in midgut epithelial cells, however amino acids alone do not induce the transcription and translation of the late phase trypsin protein [24].

The 139 kDa alpha subunit of the COPI coatomer complex was selected as one of eight candidate RER whorl-forming proteins based on bioinformatic analyses. We used RNAi-mediated knockdown to determine if loss of alpha-COPI expression had any effect on RER whorl formation in unfed mosquitoes or blood meal digestion in fed mosquitoes. Our data show that alpha-COPI functions are indeed required for RER whorl formation in unfed mosquitoes, and moreover, that a deficiency in alpha-COPI blocked the expression of three late phase midgut proteases in blood fed mosquitoes (AaSPVI, AaSPVII, AaLT). Interestingly, the early phase of blood meal digestion, which is characterized by the synthesis and secretion of the early trypsin protease (AaET), was not dependent on alpha-COPI expression.",

As seen in representative electron micrographs (Figure 1), large whorls of stacked RER membranes were observed in midgut epithelial cells from unfed (sugar only) mosquitoes, with some RER whorls containing >50 stacked membranes. The whorls appeared to consist entirely of tightly packed RER membranes, with no evidence of a core lipid droplet as seen in other organisms [25]. Quantitative measurements of whorl size in 20 randomly chosen EM fields revealed that the RER whorls ranged in size from \u223c5\u201335 \u00b5m2 in unfed mosquitoes (Figure 2). However, following a 30 minute amino acid feeding period, and another 30 minutes of recovery, midgut epithelial cells were found to contain significantly fewer RER whorls of >5 membrane stacks (p<0.001) (Figure 2). Moreover, most of the RER contained in the midgut epithelial cells of amino acid fed mosquitoes was arranged in short linear stacks (Figure 1C). Quantitative measurements of RER whorl size and number in midgut epithelial cells following a recovery period of 120 minutes after amino acid feeding gave similar results, suggesting that RER whorl unwinding is rapid and complete by 30 minutes post feeding (Figures 1D and 2).",

To test this possibility, we prepared total protein extracts from midguts of unfed and amino acid fed (30 min and 120 min post feeding) mosquitoes, and analyzed the extracts by Western blotting using a KDEL-specific antibody as shown in Figure 3. Four distinct protein bands were observed, two of which appeared to decrease in abundance after feeding (KDEL-2 and KDEL-4), relative to the internal control protein (GAPDH). The KDEL-1 protein was only present in the 30 min sample, whereas the KDEL-3 protein was present in all three protein samples. Since Ae. aegypti protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has a predicted molecular mass of \u223c56 kDa, and is a KDEL-containing ER protein known to be expressed in Ae. aegypti midgut cells [26], we analyzed these same protein extracts with a PDI antibody that recognizes Drosophila melanogaster PDI. Results from these experiments were negative (data not shown), however we could not rule out that antigenic differences between Drosophila and Aedes PDI proteins contributed to the negative result.",

The protein samples were separated by molecular weight using SDS PAGE and four gel slices from each lane were processed for LC-MS/MS analysis and protein annotation (Figure 4). The SDS PAGE analysis revealed that intact proteins of up to \u223c130 kDa were present in both samples, suggesting that protease activity was minimal in the midgut protein sample from fed mosquitoes.

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that \u223c30% of the identified proteins could be assigned to microsomes (including ribosomal proteins and protein synthesis related proteins), \u223c19% were mitochondrial proteins, \u223c37% were cytoplasmic proteins, and \u223c14% were from other cellular fractions, including the nucleus. Eight of the microsomal proteins that were present in the protein sample from unfed mosquitoes, were chosen as candidate whorl-associated proteins based on their known role in ER or Golgi processes (Table 1). Based on peptide frequency, the most often represented protein was SND1 (Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1), which is also known as Tudor domain-containing protein 11 [27]. Although SND1 is assigned to the Golgi apparatus cellular component by GO analysis, its primary function is gene regulation and RNA processing [28]. The peptide frequency of SND1 was similar in protein samples from unfed and fed mosquitoes, even though EM analysis revealed that the majority of RER whorl unwinding had already occurred by 30 min post amino acid feeding (Figure 1C). This result suggests that SND1 is most likely not associated with whorl maintenance since its presence in microsomal fractions is independent of whorl formation.",

Since COPI subunits are soluble proteins that transiently cycle between vesicle membrane bound and unbound forms as a function of interactions with Arf proteins [29], [30], the observed differential abundance of COPI subunits in the two midgut microsomal fractions suggests that they could be associated with RER whorls.

Since 100% of the alpha-COPI dsRNA injected mosquitoes we analyzed showed a similar decrease in alpha-COPI transcript levels (Figure 5), we used this dsRNA injection protocol to knock down alpha-COPI expression in mosquitoes that were subsequently maintained on sugar alone (unfed), or fed an amino acid meal and sacrificed 120 min post-feeding.",

RER reorganization at 120 min post-feeding in Fluc dsRNA injected mosquitoes looked similar to that of uninjected mosquitoes at the same time point, in that few if any whorls were present (compare Figures 7B and 1D). As shown in Figure 8, by quantitating the number and size of whorls in midgut epithelial cells from alpha-COPI and Fluc dsRNA injected mosquitoes, it is clear that loss of alpha-COPI expression in unfed mosquitoes was associated with a significant decrease in RER whorl formation. Moreover, a similar quantitative analysis of midgut epithelial cells from amino acid fed alpha-COPI dsRNA injected mosquitoes, showed highly disorganized endosomal structures and extended regions of swollen RER (Figures 7C and 7D).

To determine if alpha-COPI functions are required for the synthesis and secretion of early and late phase serine proteases, we injected mosquitoes with Fluc and alpha-COPI dsRNA 3 days prior to blood feeding and used Western blotting to detect protease protein expression at 3 hr PBM (AeET) and 24 hr PBM (AaSPVI, AaSPVII, AaLT). As shown in Figure 9A, the pattern of AeET protein expression is similar in Fluc and alpha-COPI dsRNA injected mosquitoes, suggesting that alpha-COPI functions are not required for early phase blood meal digestion. However, as shown in Figure 9B, 100\u2013400 ng of alpha-COPI dsRNA blocks expression of all three abundant late phase proteases at 24 hr PBM in a dose-dependent manner. Lack of late phase serine protease expression in alpha-COPI deficient mosquitoes was associated with ejection of the undigested blood meal between 12\u201330 hr PBM (data not shown).",

Our objective in the studies reported here was to first determine if amino acids were sufficient to induce RER whorl unwinding, and if they were, to use a combination of proteomic and RNAi approaches to identify proteins that may be required for maintenance of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells.

Based on physiological studies showing that artificial amino acids meals are sufficient to induce early events in the blood digestion process [33], it has been proposed that amino acids could play a signaling role by inducing protease expression [24]. Consistent with this idea, we have recently shown that amino acid feeding stimulates translation of pre-existing early trypsin mRNA through activation of the TOR signaling pathway [23]. Since large ER whorl structures have been shown to exist in the midgut of Ae. aegypti and other mosquito species [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [9], we used EM ultrastructural analysis to test if amino acid feeding induces ER whorl unwinding. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, our data clearly demonstrate that amino acid feeding does induce ER whorl unwinding, and moreover, that the most abundant whorls consist of rough ER membranes based on the high density of ribosomal particles.",

For example, treatment of mouse Leydig cells with the piperazine derivative diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC), led to the appearance of large lipid droplets, degenerative mitochondria, and giant smooth ER whorls in some cells [25]. Since DEC has been shown to disrupt ER and golgi vesicle transport processes, it could explain the formation of ER whorls. A similar loss of function study leading to the formation of ER whorls was seen in human HeLa cells in which expression of the ER protein Yip1A was knocked down by RNAi [18]. Therefore one of the functions of Yip1A could be to maintain proper ER/golgi membrane networks under normal conditions, but when it is absent, ER membranes collapse into whorl structures.",

Support for this model comes from studies in cultured cells showing that protein overexpression can induce ER whorl formation. Snapp et al. (2003) [15] reported that overexpression of cytochrome b5 induced the formation of smooth ER whorls, they called organized smooth ER (OSER), in transfected CV-1 cells. These same OSER structures could be observed when b5-GFP fusion proteins were over expressed, as long as they retained dimerization function in either the b5 or GFP protein domains. The authors proposed that weak noncovalent interactions between ER resident proteins on apposing stacked membranes are sufficient to maintain smooth ER whorl structures. Similar OSER structures were shown to form in HeLa cells that were infected with an adenovirus vector expressing the ER resident protein LAT linked to a heterologous protein dimerization domain [16], or overexpression of a viral protein that associates with ER membranes in infected cells [17].",

Moreover, since we found that RER whorl unwinding occurs rapidly once feeding begins (Figure 1), we were able to use a short recovery time of only 30 min to enrich for microsomal proteins that are present in the mosquito midgut prior to feeding. The LC-MS/MS analysis identified 127 proteins using microsomal midgut protein samples from unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes. Eight proteins were considered candidate whorl associated proteins based on their known location and function in ER and Golgi membrane compartments (see Table 1). Since three of the candidate proteins encoded COPI coatomer subunits, and the peptide frequency was lower for each of the proteins in samples from fed mosquitoes compared to unfed mosquitoes, we chose alpha-COPI as a representative coatomer subunit and performed RNAi knockdown experiments. Data presented in Figures 6, 7, and 8 show that loss of alpha-COPI expression is associated with the absence of RER whorls in unfed mosquitoes, as well as membrane disorganization and ER swelling in midgut epithelial cells of amino acid fed mosquitoes. These data suggest that alpha-COPI, and likely two or more of the other seven COPI coatomer subunits, are involved in RER whorl formation and maintenance in midgut epithelial cells of unfed female mosquitoes. Based on the association of RER whorls with untranslated AeET mRNA transcripts in unfed mosquitoes, we predicted that RER whorls inhibited the translation of AaET transcripts. However the data in Figure 9A clearly show that this is not the case since sugar fed alpha-COPI dsRNA injected mosquitoes lacked both RER whorls and AaET protein expression. Surprisingly, while synthesis and secretion of AeET was not altered in blood fed alpha-COPI deficient mosquitoes, expression of three abundant late phase proteases (AaSPVI, AaSPVII, AaLT) was inhibited (Figure 9B), indicating that COPI vesicle transport is required for later events in the blood digestion process.",

However, the COPI system has also been shown to function in anterograde transport in some secretory cells where it was found to be required for exocytosis of specific proteins [34]. The COPI vesicle transport system consists of seven coatomer subunits (alpha, beta, beta', gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta), which function as structural components that promote vesicle formation, a G protein that facilitates coatomer assembly and membrane budding (Arf), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that activate Arf proteins and thereby initiate coatomer assembly, and GTPase activating proteins (ArfGAPs) that stimulate GTP hydrolysis in Arf proteins and induce coatomer disassembly, which is required for vesicle membrane fusion. Based on our finding that loss of alpha-COPI expression in midgut epithelial cells of unfed mosquitoes disrupts RER whorl formation, without decreasing the total amount of RER membrane in cells (Figure 6C and 6D), we propose that COPI coatomer proteins directly contribute to whorl formation through subunit assembly. Further experiments are needed to directly test this idea, for example, by using immunogold EM analysis to determine if COPI coatomer proteins are tightly associated with RER whorls, and if so, which coatomer subunits are colocalized.",

Briefly, the dissected midguts were homogenized with a blue Kontes pestle and spun at 1000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The post nuclear supernatant was transferred into a clean 1.5-ml tube and spun at 12000g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The post mitochondrial supernatant was transferred into a clean 1.5-ml tube and mixed with 7.5 volumes of 8 mM CaCl2 by vortexing. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min and then spun at 8,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing the microsomal fraction, was resuspended in 20 \u00b5l of 1\u00d7 Isotonic Extraction Buffer followed by a 10-min of incubation on ice. A 5 \u00b5l portion of the extracted ER protein fraction was used for measuring protein concentration with the BCA\u2122 Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, USA). The remaining ER proteins were mixed with an appropriate amount of 5\u00d7SDS sample loading buffer, boiled for 4 min, and spun at 13000\u00d7 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was stored at \u221220C for SDS-PAGE.",

Each gel lane was cut into 4 equal slices using a scalpel, and labeled as A, B, C, and D from high to low molecular weight regions. The gel slices were stored individually stored in a clean Eppendorf tube for in-gel digestion. Each gel slice was washed first with ddH2O for 15 min, then twice with 50% acetonitrile (ACN), and finally with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Ambic, pH 8.0) containing 50% ACN for 15 min. After drying, the gel pieces were subjected to the standard in-gel digestion protocol. Briefly, proteins were reduced by 10 mM DTT/100 mM Ambic at 56\u00b0C for 45 min., and alkylated by 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA)/100 mM Ambic at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Gel pieces were washed with 100 mM Ambic dehydrated with ACN and dried. Proteolytic digestion was performed with 12.5 ng/\u00b5l trypsin dissolved in 100 mM Ambic and incubated on ice for 45 min. The digested mixture was acidified with 2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water for 1\u20132 minutes and then the supernatant was collected in a clean 1.5-ml tube. The peptides were extracted from the gel slice using 0.1% TFA in water, 0.1% TFA in 30% ACN, and 0.1% TFA in 60% ACN, respectively, with ultrasonication. The peptides extracted in the four steps were combined together, concentrated by a SpeedVac to a desired volume and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.",
