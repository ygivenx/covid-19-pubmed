The mode of inheritance of the deviant phenotype is autosomal recessive. In addition to deafness, the animals show spontaneous lateralized circling behavior, stargazing, locomotor hyperactivity, moderate ataxia and the inability to swim. Motor abnormalities can either be induced through stress or occur spontaneously [1]. The symptoms manifest during the first three weeks of life. Histological analysis of the inner ear revealed that the organ of Corti, which includes inner and outer hair cells, is completely absent or occasionally reduced. However, inner hair cells and outer hair cells of the vestibular organs are both present. Characteristic effects in this area are shortened stereocilia, a lower number of ganglion cells and a reduced thickness of axons [2].",

This is a clinically variable human disease, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular dysfunctions and visual impairment. The disease is caused by several mutations in proteins integrated in the Usher protein network. The syndrome has three distinct clinical subtypes [16] referred to as USH1, USH2, USH3, which vary in the severity of disease manifestation with USH1 being the most severe form. Patients suffer from profound hearing loss, constant vestibular dysfunction (balance deficiency) and a prepubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa. The latter is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the retinal photoreceptor cells [17] that leads to night blindness and visual field loss over the course of several decades [18], [19].",

Comparison of environmental conditions revealed some differences between the two facilities but so far it has not been possible to pinpoint to any obvious factors affecting the animals' sight. Involvement of certain pathogens, e.g. coronavirus or Borna disease virus, has been reported in retinal degenerations [44], [45] and the rats were examined for the most important pathogens, however, none with relevance were detected. The light intensity was another factor that was closely watched since albino rats easily suffer retinal damages from increased light intensities. Therefore, the maximum light intensity for albino rat strains is recommended to be 60 lux (www.gv-solas.de/auss/hal/rattenhaltung.pdf). In the MedSchool the light intensity inside the cages ranged between 2 and 6 lux. In the VetSchool intensities of 6 to 28 lux were measured, with the exception of the top row of the female's rack where a light intensity of 130 lux was observed (Table 2). Furthermore, in the animal room of the VetSchool the illumination was unbalanced, as part of the room was brighter than the rest.",

The relevance of environmental factors for the development of retinal syndromes has been discussed for a long time. In the human Usher syndrome intrafamilial and interfamilial variations of retinal impairment have been reported, thereby indicating an involvement of genetic and non-genetic modifiers in disease expression [46]. A study by Liu et al. [47] indicates that even in humans clinical progression is influenced by environmental factors: monozygotic twins from an atypical USH family showed differences in the course of the disease and the severity of symptoms. Therefore, the varying phenotypes of humans, mice and rats harboring mutations in the C-terminal region of myosin XV might be due to different environmental conditions. Not only the retinal but also the vestibular phenotypes are absent in human patients.",
