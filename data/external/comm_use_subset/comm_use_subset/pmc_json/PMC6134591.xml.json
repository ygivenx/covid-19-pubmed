            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), one of the prototype viruses of the Coronaviridae family, is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that causes significant economic losses in poultry industry worldwide [1, 2]. In chickens, IBV causes an acute highly contagious disease which affects the respiratory tract, gut, kidneys, bursa and reproductive systems, and the disease is characterized by 50\u2013100% morbidity and 0\u201325% mortality rates in affected flocks [3, 4]. The viral genome encodes four major structural proteins, namely membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N), spike protein (S) and envelope protein (E), that facilitate host entry and virus assembly [5]. The S protein is post-translationally cleaved by host cell serine proteases to form two subunits, S1 and S2, and this cleavage plays an important role in viral infectivity [6]. The S1 subunit binds to host cell receptors and is the main target for induction of serotype-specific neutralizing and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies [7, 8], and it is sufficient to induce protective immune responses [9]. To prevent economic losses resulted by IB, live attenuated and inactivated oil adjuvanted IBV vaccines have been employed in the field [9]; however, these types of vaccines are associated with some limitations. Inactivated IBV vaccines are safe, but relatively costlier and less effective than live attenuated vaccines, while use of live attenuated vaccines may result in the emergence of novel variants of the virus [10, 11]. Furthermore, the existence of more than 20 IBV serotypes with little cross protective immunity among vaccine strains results in poor efficacy of the currently available vaccines. The introduction and development of an effective and safe vaccine against each IBV serotype is not an economically viable option for the poultry industry. Therefore, novel approaches should be devised that are not only egg independent and cost-effective, but easy to amplify and can provide efficient protection against the circulating IBV strains.",

            "text": "Identification and characterization of regional and most circulating serotypes plays an important role in the development of a successful vaccination program. Over the past decade, nephropathogenic IBV variants have been continuously evolved in South Korea via accumulated point mutations and by recombination with other existing strains [12]. Thus, emphasizing the need for the development of efficient and effective vaccination strategies which respond to the circulating field strains in a very short notice. In accordance with this notion, the present study exploited Salmonella Gallinarum (SG) to deliver immunogenic S1 protein (20\u2013263 amino acid residues) of most emerging and circulating nephropathogenic strain of IBV in South Korea. SG is an intracellular Gram-negative bacterium that causes fowl typhoid (FT) in domestic birds, primarily chickens, and rarely causes food poisoning in humans [13]. In chickens, FT is characterized by severe inflammation and acute mortality that causes significant economic losses in poultry industry worldwide [13\u201315]. The disease has worldwide distribution and is endemic in many parts of the world. Besides farm hygiene and biosecurity measures, the control and eradication of FT can be effectively achieved by vaccination with live attenuated and inactivated killed vaccines. We previously have developed an attenuated SG vaccine strain (JOL916) that effectively controls FT infection in chickens [16]. Exploiting live attenuated Salmonella system to deliver IBV S1 immunogenic protein is a highly economical vaccination strategy that allows for a quick response to deployment of vaccines, as it circumvents the need for a constant supply of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs. Furthermore, Salmonella-based vaccination strategy induces efficient antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity [17\u201319], and these vaccines have already been approved for use in poultry [20]. Herein, we show that attenuated SG mutant delivering immunogenic S1 protein elicited efficient IBV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses and conferred significant protection against a virulent IBV challenge. We also demonstrate that attenuated SG delivering S1 protein protected chickens against a lethal wild-type SG challenge.",

The S1 nucleotide sequence was codon optimized for efficient expression in SG. The optimized gene sequence was chemically synthesized (Bionee, Korea) and then built into the pJHL65 plasmid, an asd+ constitutive expression vector, and propagated in an asd mutated Escherichia coli strain as described previously [25]. The S1 gene sequence was cloned in frame downstream to the beta-lactamase signal sequence (bla SS) of pJHL65 vector, so that the intended protein would get secreted out of the bacteria [26]. The recombinant plasmid, pJHL65-S1, was subsequently transformed into an attenuated auxotrophic mutant of SG strain, JOL967, and the resultant clone was designated as JOL2077. The JOL967 strain was constructed by the deletion of the lon, cpxR, and asd genes from the wild-type SG strain, JOL394 isolate, using allelic exchange method as described and reported elsewhere [16], and used as the delivery vehicle for the S1 protein. To produce the coating antigen for determination of IBV-specific antibody responses, the S1 gene was cloned into pET28a (+) expression vector (Novagen, San Diego, USA) that was subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain (Novagen, USA) for protein expression. The expressed S1 protein in both S. typhimurium and E. coli was confirmed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal infectious bronchitis virus antibody (#ab31671, Abcam). The E. coli expressed S1 protein was purified by Ni\u2013NTA affinity column chromatography and dialysed against PBS (three washes). Purified protein was quantified by a Bradford assay [27], filtered, and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use.",

            "text": "This study was aimed to investigate whether attenuated SG delivering S1 protein could induce protective immune responses against both IB and FT in chickens. Our strategy of employing Salmonella system as a delivery system for S1 protein has certain advantages over live attenuated or inactivated IB vaccines. These types of vaccines are easy to prepare, stable, convenient, economical, and easy to administer in chickens. Moreover, these types of vaccines does not require exogenous adjuvants as Salmonella bacteria provide an appropriate danger signals to the immune system, acting as natural adjuvant, thereby promoting efficient maturation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) [25, 30], which is prerequisite for the induction of potent adaptive immune responses. Also SG-based IB vaccination can differentiate vaccinated birds from infected ones as only structural and immunogenic antigens are exploited for the vaccine development. Previously, Salmonella-based system has been exploited to deliver DNA encoded foreign antigens to induce protective immune responses against a variety of pathogens, especially those invading via the mucosal route [19, 31, 32]. However, a potential limitation associated with the Salmonella delivered DNA vaccines is the inability to stably maintain the plasmid DNA inside the bacterium. Moreover, the gene expressions of heterologous antigens encoded by DNA is inefficient, resulting in poor immunogenicity of the vaccine [31], thus, requiring multiple immunizations to elicit some level of significant protection in vaccinated animals [21]. In accordance with this notion, we hypothesized that SG delivering S1 antigen in protein format could induce efficient IBV-specific protective immunity in chickens. We show that single oral inoculation of SG-based S1 vaccine induced efficient protective immune responses against IBV in chickens. We also show that SG delivering S1 protein does not affect the induction of SG-specific humoral and cell-mediated protective immune responses.",

            "text": "The present study demonstrated that orally administered JOL2077 vaccine elicited efficient circulating IgG responses in vaccinated chickens. The role of circulating antibody titers in conferring protection against IBV remains controversial. Some studies have demonstrated that circulating antibodies did not correlate well with the protection from IBV infection [33, 34], while others have shown the importance of humoral immunity in disease recovery and virus clearance [35, 36]. Nevertheless, JOL2077 vaccination had conferred significant protection against IBV challenge and had efficiently contained IBV replication in virus-targeted tissues. Furthermore, JOL2077 vaccinated chickens displayed insignificant inflammatory lesions in IBV-targeted tissues. The role of IgA antibodies in providing resistance to IBV infection is well-documented [35, 37]. The elicitation of IgA antibodies at mucosal surfaces plays an important role in limiting spread of pathogens that primarily enter into systemic circulation via mucosal route. This has direct implication on the pathogenesis and the clinical outcome of the disease. We found significantly higher IgA responses in JOL2077 vaccinated chickens compared to the JOL2068 control group. This finding might explain why JOL2077 vaccinated chickens displayed insignificant inflammatory lesions in targeted tissues and achieved higher level of protection than control groups. Consistent with the notion that cellular immunity is protective against IBV infection [38], we next investigated cytokine and T cell recall responses elicited by our JOL2077 vaccine. After antigenic stimulation, CD4+ T cells secrete anti-viral cytokines, which generate potent antibody formation and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus playing a critical role in controlling IBV infection [39, 40]. The present study demonstrated that chickens vaccinated with JOL2077 vaccine displayed higher CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses compared to the control chickens. Consequently, the higher protection rate was observed in chickens vaccinated with JOL2077 vaccine. The nature of the cytokines produced after antigenic stimulation in vitro is an important parameter to define the type of immunity elicited [41]. Our data showed that JOL2077 vaccine induced efficient IBV-specific both Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine responses, which is indicative of the mixed-type of immunity. IFN-\u03b3 has potent anti-viral activity through the promotion of natural-killer cells and macrophage activation that are likely to contribute to the containment of IBV replication and spread within the host. Further, IFN-\u03b3 upregulates MHC-I and MHC-II molecules and induces IL-12, nitric oxide and superoxide production in macrophages, all of which are important in the elimination of intracellular pathogens [42]. These findings might further explain the higher protection rate observed in JOL2077 vaccinated chickens. The IL-4 and IL-10 have a clear role in promoting humoral immune responses [43, 44]. Previous studies have reported that IL-10 augment the proliferation and plasma differentiation of the B cells that have switched to IgA production, suggesting that IL-10 plays an important role in development of mucosal immunity. Considering that both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are important in containment of IBV replication and clinical disease, our study clearly shows that JOL2077 vaccine is capable of eliciting efficient humoral and CMI responses, and can, thus, offer significant protection against IBV in chickens.",

The systemic IgG mediate protection during the early stages of infection when SG circulates extracellularly before it penetrates the target cells [45]. The present study demonstrated that systemic IgG responses were highest in chickens vaccinated with either JOL2068 or JOL2077 strain compared to the PBS control group. Consequently, the mortality rate was lowest in both JOL2068 and JOL2077 vaccinated chickens compared to the chickens that received PBS only. The induction of immune responses at mucosal surfaces serves as the first line defense against pathogens that enter into systemic circulation through mucosal surfaces. Importantly, the presence of antigen-specific secretory (s) IgA antibodies in the intestinal mucus acts as an immunological barrier, thereby preventing the adherence of Salmonella bacteria to the intestinal lining and subsequent penetration into deeper tissues [46]. In the present study, we observed that the sIgA levels were highest in JOL2068 and JOL2077 vaccinated chickens. Consequently, the lower bacterial load was observed in spleen and liver of chickens vaccinated with either JOL2068 or JOL2077 strain. These findings clearly suggest that SG can be exploited to deliver viral antigens to elicit carrier and virus-specific humoral and cell mediated protective immune responses.",
