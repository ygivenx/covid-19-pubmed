The dromedary camel genome has been sequenced recently [17, 18], which opens the door to study the camel genomically. The reference camel genome enabled the identification of genes associated with white-spotting coat color [19], solid coat colors [20], and \u201ctameness\u201d [21]. The aforementioned studies employed an approach that consists of sequencing candidate genes [22]\u2014this approach is limited in utility and does not allow for exploring the wide-range of camel phenotypes. The candidate gene approach can be applied only when the biology of the phenotype is fully understood and a prior knowledge of candidate genes and their functions is available [22]. A biobank of camel DNA samples, with associated phenotypes, is needed to utilize genome sequencing and SNP genotyping technologies in linkage analyses [23] or genome-wide association studies [24]. Moreover, validating the association and possibly the causation, of the genetic variants of a given phenotype requires genotyping a large number of individuals (positive and negative for the phenotype) and examining the agreement between their genotype and phenotype [25]. This validation method will benefit greatly from a camel DNA biobank.",

DNA biobanking for genetic studies requires careful consideration of the used biological specimens, insofar as their source, and their yielded quality and quantity to enable DNA genotyping and sequencing, as well as their ease of transport, and their amenability for long-term storage prior to DNA extraction. Another important aspect to consider when establishing a DNA biobank, is the depth of the information associated with the samples collected from each specimen. Such information includes age, sex, breed, pedigree information, geographic location, phenotypic attributes (e.g. coat color and texture), morphological measurements (e.g. size and height), and productivity (e.g. milk volume, carcass weight, hide quality). To this effect, we recently developed the data collection and organization application, SamplEase [28], that aims to expedite the collection of all the necessary information associated with each DNA sample in the envisioned camel biobank.",

These limitations are that camel blood collection requires (1) special veterinary training, (2) assistance of camel handlers, (3) collection tools (needles, syringes, EDTA tubes etc.), (4) care to avoid accidents due to contact (i.e. kicks, bites), (5) precaution against possible harmful pathogens [38, 39], (6) long camel-handling time, (7) breeder cooperation, and (8) special means of transportation and storage (i.e. coolers, freezers) [40]. By comparison, buccal swab collection only requires handling assistants, care to avoid accidental bites, sterile cytological brushes, and moderate collection time (personal observation). Tail-hair samples have the least requirements, where no special training or assistants are needed, no collection tools, and minimal camel handling time (leading to fast sample collection), and easy transportation and storage of specimens in envelopes at room temperature (personal observation). These minimal requirements for tail-hair collection makes them more suitable than whole-blood and buccal swabs for establishing a DNA biobank, as recognized for other domesticated animals such as cattle and yaks [36].",

The highest amount DNA was obtained from tail-hair samples (with a maximum of 25 \u03bcg), and the lowest was from whole-blood samples (with a maximum of 4 \u03bcg). Unlike DNA extracted from buccal swabs and tail-hair follicles, DNA extracted from whole-blood samples was similar both in appearance on the gel and average quantity (\u03bcg) for all five-starting whole-blood volumes used (Table 1; Fig 2). This may be due to the overall low blood volumes (20\u2013100 \u03bcl) used in this study. In other words, differences in the amount of extracted DNA might be more apparent if larger starting volumes (100\u20131000\u03bcl) were used instead. The overwhelming majority of extracted samples in this study were within the accepted range of DNA purity (260/280nm ratio = 1.8\u20132.2) (Fig 2) for DNA sequencing and genotyping [41]. Nonetheless, four out of twenty-seven DNA samples extracted from single buccal swabs exhibited noticeable low 260/280 nm ratio.

The result for saliva and tail-hair was in accordance with previous studies.

The rate of DNA degradation over the examined 9-month period was similar for both saliva and tail-hair (Fig 5), however, greater deterioration in the quality and purity of DNA obtained from saliva was observed, when compared to tail-hair (Fig 4). This deterioration might be due to the sensitivity of cells in saliva to degradation when stored at room temperature, or even at 4\u00b0C [46]. In contrast, DNA quantity from thirty tail-hair follicles averaged ~5 \u03bcg and ~2.0 (260/280 ratio) after being stored for 9 months.

            "text": "Blood and saliva are the most used sources of DNA for genetic studies, especially in humans [47], cats [48], and dogs [44]. However, our results indicate that tail-hair follicles seem to be more optimal than these two sources for large-scale genetic studies in camels especially for its ease of collection, transport, and storage prior to DNA extraction and for providing sufficient DNA amounts for genotyping and sequencing. Camel hair was previously used for STR genotyping [30, 49] and DNA sequencing [19, 21]. Beyond the currently-employed PCR applications, STR genotyping, and targeted sequencing, based on our results, we expect that camel tail-hair can be successfully applied to current genotyping and sequencing technologies. This is driven by recent successful use of tail-hair for genome-wide SNP genotyping and association studies in cattle [50, 51], horses [52], and goats [53]. It is worth noting that adequate amounts of hair (i.e. 40\u201350 hair follicles) should be used to produce SNP genotype calls, as indicated in a comparative analysis of the genotyping success of horse blood and hair-root samples [54]. These recent studies increase the prospects of the utility of tail-hair for camel DNA biobanking and studies associated with this biobank.",
