DENV infection can be asymptomatic or cause a spectrum of disease ranging from classical dengue fever (DF) to more severe, life-threatening forms termed dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [2]. Approximately 500,000 dengue patients require hospitalization annually, of whom a large proportion are children [3]. Although several antiviral and vaccine candidates are in various phases of preclinical and clinical evaluation, current treatment remains supportive care [4].",

            "text": "The immune response to primary (1\u00b0) DENV infection is characterized by an early IgM response followed by an IgG response with predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses [5]. Na\u00efve B cells are stimulated and develop into DENV-specific B cells, which either differentiate into memory B cells (MBCs) residing in the secondary lymphoid organs or into plasma cells (PCs) secreting antigen-specific antibodies (Abs). Short-lived PCs are active during acute infection, while long-lived PCs (LLPCs) migrate to the bone marrow and are responsible for long-term humoral immunity [6], [7]. MBCs, which retain antigen-specific Abs at their surface, and LLPCs, which secrete antigen-specific Abs, undergo affinity maturation, and only clones bearing Abs with the highest affinity survive long-term [8]. This process takes several weeks after acute infection and continues despite the absence of circulating antigen. During a secondary (2\u00b0) DENV infection, MBCs are rapidly activated [9], [10]. Prior DENV infection provides robust immunity against the homotypic DENV serotype [11], [12]. In contrast, 2\u00b0 heterotypic infections are associated with a higher incidence of DHF/DSS, possibly attributable in part to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where pre-formed Abs to the 1\u00b0 infecting serotype bind but do not neutralize the 2\u00b0 infecting serotype, instead facilitating an increase in viral uptake by Fc\u03b3-receptor bearing cells [13]. In addition to ADE, cross-reactive T cells formed during the 1\u00b0 DENV infection can be over-activated, potentially contributing to dengue pathogenesis [14], [15]. However, the vast majority of 2\u00b0 DENV infections are asymptomatic or only result in mild disease [16], suggesting a protective immune response [17].",

The avidity of anti-flavivirus monoclonal Abs (MAbs) was shown to positively correlate with neutralization activity in vitro\n[19], consistent with lower neutralizing activity observed with MAbs with lower affinity against variant genotypes within a single DENV serotype [20], [21]. However, the relation between neutralizing activity and polyclonal serum avidity is still unclear [9], [22]. Measurement of IgG avidity has been shown to discriminate between 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 DENV infection in polyclonal serum [23]\u2013[25] but has not been followed longitudinally.",

In Nicaragua, one DENV serotype tends to dominate for several years, while other DENV serotypes co-circulate at lower levels. DENV3 was the dominant serotype in 2008\u20132011 [26]. Prior to this, DENV2 was the predominant serotype between 1999 and 2002 and between 2005 and 2007 [27]\u2013[29], while DENV1 predominated between 2002 and 2005 [30]. DENV4 only circulates at a low level in Nicaragua [31]. We studied both 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 DENV infections from the acute phase until 18 months (m) post-infection. In 2\u00b0 infections, we measured neutralizing Ab titers and avidity to DENV3, the currently infecting serotype, and to DENV2, the most prevalent previously circulating serotype and our prototype to assess cross-reactive responses and cross-protection [9], [28]. As both Ab concentration and avidity can play a significant role in virus neutralization [32], we tested possible correlations between IgM and IgG avidity to DENV, total Ab titer and DENV-specific neutralization titer.",

Briefly, study enrollment occurred in the Nicaraguan National Pediatric Reference Hospital, Hospital Infantil Manuel de Jes\u00fas Rivera (HIMJR), in Managua from August 1, 2010, to January 31, 2011, during the peak dengue season. Inclusion criteria included age between 6 m and 15 years of age. Samples were collected for 3 consecutive days after enrollment (acute), 14\u201328 days after onset of symptoms (convalescent), and at 3 m, 6 m and 18 m post-illness. DENV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of viral RNA [34]; isolation of DENV in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells [27]; seroconversion of DENV-specific IgM Abs as measured by IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) between acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples [35]; and/or a \u22654-fold increase in total Ab titer, as measured by Inhibition ELISA [30], [36], between paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples as previously described [26]. 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 DENV infections were defined by an Ab titer by Inhibition ELISA of <10 or \u226510 in acute-phase samples, respectively, and/or <2,560 or \u22652,560 in convalescent phase samples, respectively [31], [37]. The total Ab titer was measured only during the acute and convalescent phases of the infection, as it decreases substantially thereafter.",

To standardize the amount of DENV2 N172 to the amount of DENV3, we used a pan-DENV MAb, 2H12 (gift from G. Screaton, Imperial College, UK) [40]. Serial dilutions of DENV2 and the 1\u2236300 dilution of DENV3 were coated and incubated with 1 \u00b5g/mL of 2H12 MAb. The 1\u2236300 dilution of DENV2 (3.6\u00d7104 pfu/ml) yielded the same OD as the 1\u2236300 DENV3 and was used thereafter. To determine serum IgG avidity, plates were coated with whole virus and incubated with heat-inactivated diluted serum samples (1\u2236100) in triplicate, then washed with urea or PBS for 10 min before adding the secondary biotin-conjugated Ab (donkey anti-human IgG, 1\u22361,000), streptavidin-AP conjugate (1\u22361,000), and PnPP substrate [9]. Using samples from the same study population, we previously optimized the amount of urea to be used, and 6M urea for 1\u00b0 DENV infections and 9M urea for 2\u00b0 DENV infections yielded the best results for analyzing serum avidity to DENV over time [9]. To measure serum IgM avidity, a donkey anti-human IgM, Fc-fragment-specific MAb (1\u22361,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as secondary Ab. For acute-phase samples, days 4\u20136 post-onset of symptoms were chosen. Background levels were measured with dengue-negative human sera. For each sample, avidity was calculated as percentage of IgG or IgM bound by dividing the background-adjusted OD after urea washes by the adjusted OD after PBS washes.",

Protection from DENV infection and/or disease may depend on DENV-specific serum neutralization and thus may be associated with DENV-specific Ab titer and DENV-specific serum avidity. However, several questions remained unanswered, such as the role of IgM Abs and whether serum avidity correlates with serum neutralization. Using our longitudinal sample series from our hospital-based study, we show for the first time that DENV-specific neutralization titers peak in the convalescent phase and then decrease over time in both 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 DENV3 infections. We also observed increasing DENV3-specific avidity between the convalescent phase and 3 m post-infection in 1\u00b0 DENV3 cases and between acute and convalescent phases in 2\u00b0 DENV3 infections. In addition, we detected higher avidity against a heterologous, potentially previously infecting serotype (DENV2) in the acute phase of 2\u00b0 DENV3 infections, while avidity was higher against the current infecting serotype at later time-points (3\u201318 m). Finally, we show for the first time a correlation between serum avidity and serum neutralization titers in the context of DENV infection, and specifically demonstrate that serotype-specific neutralizing titers correlate with serum IgM avidity in 1\u00b0 acute DENV infections and with serum IgG avidity in 2\u00b0 DENV infections.",

As only clones with the highest avidity survive long-term, this leads to a higher mean IgG avidity over time [7], [8]. In contrast, in 2\u00b0 DENV infections, we observed an increase in serum IgG avidity to DENV3 earlier, between the acute and convalescent phase, which cannot be explained by affinity maturation of newly activated DENV3-specific B cells.

Serum IgG avidity to DENV2 decreases at 18 m time-point, possibly as DENV2-specific LLPCs are displaced from the bone marrow and replaced by newly generated DENV3-specific LLPCs. LLPC niches are limited in the bone marrow, and newly formed LLPCs can replace LLPCs formed during earlier infections [44], [45]. The decrease in serum IgG avidity to DENV3 at the 18 m time-point could be explained by a strong extra-follicular response induced by the presence of pre-existing anti-DENV Abs in 2\u00b0 infections, inhibiting the germinal center response and thus inhibiting a strong long-term immunity to the current infecting serotype, DENV3 [46].",

During 1\u00b0 DENV infections, neither IgG serum avidity to DENV3 nor DENV-specific total Ab titer correlated with DENV3-specific NT50. Rather, the NT50 correlated with IgM serum avidity to DENV3 in the acute phase of 1\u00b0 DENV3 infections, showing that highly avid IgM Abs are also highly neutralizing and suggesting that IgM Abs play an important role in DENV-specific serum neutralization. In contrast, in the acute phase of 2\u00b0 DENV infections, DENV3-specific NT50 correlated with IgG serum avidity to DENV3. Because of the rapid kinetics of appearance of IgG Abs in a 2\u00b0 DENV infection and the slow affinity maturation process, these highly avid IgG Abs are most likely secreted by MBCs formed during the previous infection rather than by newly-activated na\u00efve B cells. This suggests that cross-reactive Abs contribute to neutralization of acute 2\u00b0 DENV infections. This is consistent with the isolation of strongly neutralizing cross-reactive MAbs from 2\u00b0 DENV infections (S. Smith, J. Crowe, R. de Alwis, A. de Silva & E. Harris, unpublished data). IgG serum avidity to DENV2 and DENV2-specific NT50 correlated at all time-points, suggesting that affinity maturation after the 1\u00b0 infection contributes to strengthening the neutralizing activity of serum Abs. We also observed a correlation between IgG serum avidity to DENV3 and DENV2-specific NT50, further supporting the relation between cross-reactive Abs and neutralization. Furthermore, a positive correlation between DENV-specific total Ab titer and DENV3-specific NT50 in acute 2\u00b0 DENV infections was found, showing that a greater amount of Abs correlates with neutralization activity.",

However, this could be due to the relatively low disease severity in the 2010\u20132011 epidemic in Nicaragua and thus the small sample size of DHF/DSS. Finally, pre-infection samples are not available through this hospital-based study; thus, we chose one likely previous infecting serotype (DENV2) to analyze in this group of patients. Analysis of samples collected from documented sequential infections in our long-term prospective dengue cohort study will enable more precise investigation of cross-reactive Abs in 2\u00b0 DENV infections.",

To further support these results, we are conducting additional analyses of the DENV-specific serum neutralization capacity, including: 1) the use of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol to chemically deplete IgM Abs and 2) the use of DENV virions to deplete heterologous serotype cross-reactive Abs. While cross-reactive serum avidity dominates the acute 2\u00b0 DENV response, avidity to the current infecting serotype becomes dominant over time. Significant correlations were observed between neutralizing Ab titers and serum avidity to both the current and a heterotypic serotype. Future studies will address the relation of avidity and NT50 to infection outcome (symptomatic vs. inapparent) and to disease severity. The unexpected results from the first proof-of-concept dengue live attenuated vaccine efficacy trial (Phase 2b) that were recently published [52] highlight the critical need to better understand the immune response to natural DENV infections and vaccine candidates and to identify robust correlates of protection. We believe that measurement of DENV-specific serum avidity should be integrated into evaluation of future vaccine trials and applied more broadly to the study of the immune response to DENV after natural infections.",
