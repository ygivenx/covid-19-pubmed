            "text": "The canine parvovirus (CPV) infection is a viral illness that most commonly affects puppies. The infected dogs develop an acute gastroenteritis characterized by loss of appetite, vomiting, fever, diarrhea (from mucoid to haemorrhagic) and leucopenia\n[1]. CPV, a member of the Parvovirus genus, contains a single strand DNA genome of about 5200 nucleotides that is packaged in an icosahedral capsid\n[2]. There are three capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3. VP2 is the major capsid protein, and it plays an important role in determining viral host ranges and tissue tropisms\n[3]. Amino acids substitutions in VP2 gene have been responsible for genetic and antigenic properties\n[4]. The virus emerged as dog pathogen in the late 1970's as host variant of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV)\n[5,6]. A few years after its emergence, the original virus type CPV-2 was replaced by two new antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b\n[7,8]. Recently, a novel CPV mutant, CPV-2c, is widely distributed and co-existing with other CPV types in Europe\n[9,10], North\n[11,12] and South America\n[13,14] countries.",

Antigenic differences have been demonstrated between CPV variants in neutralisation tests\n[18]. There is concern that the antigenic differences may decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine based on the original antigenic type, CPV-2. Although the original vaccine has been shown to protect dogs against challenge from any of the current CPV types\n[19], there are still many cases of clinical parvovirus in dogs. For example, in 2007, an outbreak of CPV-2c was reported in Italy in the vaccinated dogs with CPV-2-based vaccine\n[20]. Some authors have suggested an update of the virus strains in current vaccines, taking into account the existing partial protection\n[21,22]. Considering this, it is important for us to isolate new parvovirus variants circulating in the field in order that more effective vaccines are prepared from an immunogenic point of view.",

The two dogs showed the similar histopathologic lesions and viral antigen staining in every specific tissue. There were typical histopathologic lesions in all tested tissues, except the heart and the lung. Extensive degenerated hepatocytes were swollen and rounded with vacuoles of varying sizes in the cytoplasm. Hepatic sinusoid was hyperemia with erythrocytes (Figure \n3A). The number of lymphocytes in periarterial lymphatic sheath was significantly increased and this area was thickened (Figure \n3B). Besides, the hyperemia in artery of spleen trabecula may be a suggestion for inflammation. In kidney, glomerulus was swollen and filled up Bowman\u2019s capsule. Endothelium and mesenchymal cell in glomerulus showed proliferation. Epithelia of renal tubules underwent degeneration and necrosis (Figure \n3C). Glial cells hyperplasia came with neuronophagia (a degenerative or dead neuron was engulfed by microgliocytes) (Figure \n3D). Similar pathological lesions were observed in all segments of the small and large intestines. Disruption of the villous architecture was characterized by blunting and fusing of villi. Epithelia of mucosa underwent degeneration, necrosis and desquamation. These changes appeared to be more significant in the duodenum (Figure \n3E) and the jejunum (Figure \n3F).",

            "text": "Point mutations in the VP2 protein have been associated with the CPV types. Sequence analysis can give ample information for CPV typing since the fragment amplified by conventional PCR encodes for at least one informative aa (residue 426) of the VP2 protein\n[23]. The change of the amino acid at position 426 can differentiate the CPV2a (Asn), CPV2b (Asp) and CPV2c (Glu)\n[24]. CPV has a worldwide distribution. In many countries in Europe, such as United Kingdom, Germany and Italy, CPV-2a has been overtaken by CPV-2b or CPV-2c. Type 2b and 2c isolates predominate in North America\n[11,12], whereas CPV-2c is more widespread in South America\n[13,14]. India has reported the prevalence of CPV-2a and CPV-2c\n[25]. This study, together with previous findings\n[15,26], indicated that CPV-2c has not been detected in China. The sequencing results of 31 CPV samples indicated that the CPV-2a variant is more popular than the CPV-2b variant in Nanjing, China. A similar epidemiological pattern has been reported in Brazil, where all circulating strains were characterized as CPV-2a\n[27]. Also, some reports showed that CPV-2a is the predominant variant in Asia\n[25,28,29] and Australia\n[30]. On the contrary, Zhang et al.\n[15] showed the high frequency of CPV-2b (21 out of 23) in China. But another research group\n[26] reported that three types of CPV, including CPV-2, CPV-2a, and CPV-2b, could be detected, and CPV-2a was predominant in China. These differences might be due to sample localities and periods. The former study focused on Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang strains from 2006 to 2009\n[15], while later samples were collected from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and Jilin Provinces from 1983 to 2008\n[26]. Interestingly, only two strains of CPV-2a reported by Zhang et al.\n[15] were collected from Nanjing, further supporting the present study that CPV-2a is the prevalent subtype in Nanjing, China.",

It is not clear whether one CPV-2 variant has a greater infection or virulence over the others. The previous work showed that experimental infection of beagles with the original type 2 infrequently resulted in severe clinical disease like that seen in natural disease\n[34]. Meunier et al.\n[35] reported that the original type 2 caused clinical signs in about 30% of infected beagles. In comparison to the original type 2, the antigenic variants 2a and 2b have been reported to cause a more severe disease\n[36]. Moon et al.\n[37] found that the overall pathogenicity of the CPV-2a variants (CPV-2a-I and 2a-V) was severer compared to the CPV-2b variant. From the above works, pathogenetic potential of CPV seems to be relative to the types of variants. But recently, there are a few published studies that described CPV-2c infections. Decaro et al.\n[38] reported that all pups infected with CPV-2c displayed clinical signs of parvovirosis, but none showed either hemorrhagic diarrhea or vomiting and all recovered in a few days. The findings from Spibey et al.\n[19] showed that all six of the infected dogs with CPV-2c became severely ill, and three of them had to be euthanized. Therefore it is reasonable to think that the types of CPV variants may not determine their pathogeneticity. This speculation is supported by the investigation from Decaro et al.\n[39] that similar patterns of tissue distribution were observed in all the examined dogs irrespective of the antigenic variant causing the disease.",

Despite the existence of several studies on the antigenic characterization and geographic distribution of type 2a and 2b CPVs in China, few data are available on the pathobiology of the CPV-2 variants. Our study showed that, the CPV-2a variant comprises 93.5% (29/31) of the field strains in Nanjing, China. All the experimentally infected beagles with CPV-2a resulted in clinical disease similar to that of natural disease (mucoid or bloody diarrhea, vomiting and etc.). Especially on day 9 p.i., two of nine had to be euthanized due to the poor prognosis even after treatment, suggesting that the Chinese CPV-2a isolate was life-threatening. Also, virus shedding from feces could be detected from day 4 p.i., and this could represent a source of viruses which could potentially infect other susceptible dogs.",

It suggests that the disease may lead to a generalized infection and cause viral replication and attack in other tissues other than the gastrointestinal tissues. The systematic infection was probably due to viral spread in the organism through the blood. This assumption can be supported by this finding that viremia was detected from day 4 p.i.",

Although CPV is known to be also able to replicate in cardiac cells and induce a fatal myocarditis, this form is rare in countries where vaccination of breeding dogs is common\n[41]. Interestingly, this virus appears to be capable of replicating in cerebral neurons in dogs. To further demonstrate this, we performed the virus isolation from brain samples and obtained positive result. To our knowledge, the parvovirus isolation from canine brain has never been reported. Schaudien et al.\n[42] also found that parvovirus antigen, as well as parvovirus DNA and mRNA, was detected within the brains of five Cretan Hound puppies suffering from a puppy shaker syndrome, further supporting the possibility of infection of the canine brain during systemic parvovirus infections. However, the findings are different from a precious report, wherein parvovirus antigen was not detectable in 40 canine brains of dogs with parvovirus enteritis\n[43]. The significantly different results might be due to viral strains, the host\u2019s immunity, or the time point of infection.",
