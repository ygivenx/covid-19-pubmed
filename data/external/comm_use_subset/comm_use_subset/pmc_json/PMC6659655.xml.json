Up to 90% of patients with MS experience lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) including detrusor overactivity, urgency, frequency of urination, nocturia and dysuria. Prevalence and severity of LUTS increase with disease duration and progression of physical disability in MS patients2. In 10\u201315% of patients, bladder symptoms are present at the onset of MS when there may be few demyelinated lesions in the spinal cord and/or brain detected by the MRI3. The most common symptom reported by patients in remission is urgency of micturition followed by urinary frequency3\u20136. Bladder symptoms become prevalent7 in patients with chronic progression of the disease, and are often accompanied by bowel and sexual dysfunction8,9. Poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying functional interplay between the lower urinary tract (LUT) and the nervous system warrants further translational and clinical research efforts in the field.",

            "text": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is one of the most studied animal models of MS which is induced by inoculation of rats or mice with antibodies against myelin binding protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)10\u201312. After inoculation, animals develop pathological features of inflammation and demyelination in the spinal cord and brain, with infiltration of the spinal cord with inflammatory cells expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines10\u201312. EAE-driven demyelination is mostly mediated by CD4 T cells of a Th17 phenotype13, which is a population of immune cells known to be associated with more severe pathology of MS14,15. Several previous studies investigated micturition abnormalities in animals with EAE. In rats with MBP-induced EAE, both detrusor areflexia and detrusor hyperactivity were observed and correlated with spinal cord inflammation and hindlimb paralysis16. Using cystometric analysis, Mizusawa et al. showed that EAE caused detrusor areflexia in 52% of female rats in comparison to 12% which developed detrusor overactivity16. Another group established that the majority of female rats showed symptoms of detrusor areflexia prior to EAE onset but that detrusor overactivity developed at the onset of the disease17. Additional animal models of neurodegeneration and demyelination include a murine model of coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (CIE)18,19. Mice inoculated with neurotropic strain A59 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) develop CIE accompanied by severe central nervous system (CNS) demyelination and axonal degeneration20,21. The viral nature of CIE model reflects a spontaneously occurring demyelination in the CNS in comparison to induced models (e.g. EAE). MHV-driven demyelination is mediated by interferon-gamma (INF-\u03b3) of a Th1 phenotype18,19,22. Compelling preponderance of Th1 cytokine responses has been previously reported in a majority of MS patients15,23,24.",

Several neural mechanisms contributing to neurogenic bladder in the CIE model of MS were identified in our laboratory. They included the morphological changes in the neuronal centers controlling micturition, activation of gliosis at the lesion sites in the spinal cord, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines during acute inflammation in the CNS followed by an up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines at later time points, and an increase of purinergic component of nerve-mediated bladder contractions associated with the changes in bladder mucosa21,25. Most of these changes were observed within a month after inoculation with the virus, when the first signs of demyelination developed in the CNS. In the present study, we aimed to understand the long-term effects of neurodegenerative changes on voiding patterns and bladder function in CIE model. We tested the hypothesis that long-lasting neurodegeneration in CIE mice may cause the development of differential neurological phenotypes of MS development associated with heterogeneous types of neurogenic LUTS.",

Therefore, we performed urodynamic evaluation of voiding patterns in each subgroup of CIE mice by in vivo cystometry which was conducted in unanesthetized mice. Figure 4a shows representative single micturition cycles recorded in the control (PBS), REC, C-PRO and C-RELAP groups of mice. At 10 wks post-inoculation, bladder capacity (Fig. 4b), the inter-micturition interval (Fig. 4c), and bladder pressure at voiding (Fig. 4d) in all groups, except for the C-RELAP group, were similar to the respective values in the control group. However, mice in C-RELAP group developed overactive bladder phenotype associated with lower bladder capacity (17.88 \u00b1 0.72 vs 107.49 \u00b1 22.56 \u03bcl, p \u2264 0.05 to control group, Fig. 4b), reduced ratio of normalized inter-micturition interval (0.17 \u00b1 0.01, p \u2264 0.05 ratio to control group, Fig. 4c), and decreased pressure at micturition (17.75 \u00b1 1.52 vs. 43.62 \u00b1 7.43 ml, p \u2264 0.05 to control; Fig. 4d). These results suggest that mice in C-RELAP group develop a more severe and long-lasting type of neurogenic bladder overactivity than other groups providing evidence of some correlation between the type of neurodegenerative changes in the CNS and type of developed voiding dysfunction in CIE mice.",

Bladder smooth muscle strips from C-PRO group had a significantly elevated contractile response to EFS (by 174.09% to control, p \u2264 0.05, Fig. 5b) and increased PF of muscle-mediated contractions (in response to high potassium, by 199.77% to control, p \u2264 0.05, Fig. 5c). Additionally, percentage of maximal purinergic responses of nerve-mediated contractions normalized to L0 were up-regulated in C-PRO group when compared to control group (p \u2264 0.05, Fig. 5d) whereas muscarinic responses in C-PRO group were comparable to the control group (Fig. 5e). We further dissected the muscarinic components (Fig. 5f) from nicotinic components (Fig. 5g) of the contractile responses to EFS but neither of them revealed significant differences between experimental groups. To evaluate the velocity of both contractile and relaxing responses after application of EFS, we calculated the contractile and relaxing slopes of purinergic, M3-mediated muscarinic, M2-mediated muscarinic, \u03b1-3 nicotinic and \u03b1-7 nicotinic responses. The purinergic component of bladder smooth muscle strips contractions from C-PRO mice showed significantly increased slope values of both contraction (Fig. 6a\u2013e) and relaxation phases (Fig. 6f\u2013j). Interestingly, the purinergic, \u03b13- and \u03b17-nicotinic components of the detrusor contractile responses in C-RELAP group of mice showed a significantly delayed relaxation rates as evidenced by the Sr slope (Fig. 6f,i,j).",

Dysfunctional level of mobility in MS varies depending on the stage and severity of the disease26. Based on a recently updated classification of MS phenotypes in humans27, C-PRO subgroup of CIE mice may correspond to the clinically \u201cprogressive type\u201d of human MS, whereas C-RELAP subgroup is reflective of a \u201crelapsing-remitting phenotype\u201d in MS patients. REC subgroup in CIE mice is characterized by the recovery from the initial neurological impairment and absence of active CSS which corresponds to a type of MS which is not active but could still be progressing27. While the development of several distinguished clinical phenotypes in CIE mice provides an additional evidence of the high translational value of the viral murine MS model for future pharmacological and therapeutic studies, further experiments including MRI imaging in CIE mice would be helpful to better correlate the observed clinical symptoms in animals with the MS phenotypes in humans.",

            "text": "Progression of MS symptoms in patients is closely associated with the degree of inflammation in the CNS characterized by expression levels of cytokines and growth factors. The phenotypes of neurological impairment and bladder dysfunction observed in CIE mice correlated with functional modulation of the cytokines and growth factors in the CNS and urinary bladder. For example, C-PRO group showed a significantly increased TGF-\u03b2 in the bladder as compared to PBS mice, but the same growth factor was unchanged in the other two CIE subtypes, REC and C-RELAP group. TGF-\u03b2 along with IL-10 are known to be a co-inhibitory molecule expressed in peripheral regulatory immune cell population, which is forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) + regulatory T cells (Tregs) and type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1). The peripheral regulatory immune cells expressing TGF-\u03b2 and/or IL-10 are known to trigger autoreactive T cells anergy under normal conditions28. We speculate that an up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 in the urinary bladder of C-PRO group may reflect TGF-\u03b2-mediated inhibitory feedback loop in response to continuous progression of neurological impairment, which is not present in C-RELAP and REC group. On the other side, INF-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1, which are known to trigger progression of MS, are significantly up-regulated in the urinary bladder of C-PRO group29,30. Furthermore, in both C-RELAP and C-PRO group, the changes in cytokine content in the brain and urinary bladder suggest a functional cross-talk between the two systems. This speculation is supported by the previous studies which established a correlation between the functional connectivity within brain regions and voiding behavior in MS patients31, thereby, providing evidence of the relationship between pyramidal impairment in the lower limb and the severity of LUTS in MS patients4,7. The underlying mechanisms of such association are still unclear but could be partly explained by somatic-visceral convergence in the neural control of the lower limb and urinary bladder function4,32. Recent studies also suggest the contribution of peripheral nervous system and changes in the visceral organs to the modulation of LUTS in MS patients33. This is supported by the reports that local administration of lidocaine and cannabinoids in the urinary bladder of MS patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity was proven to be therapeutically effective to improve voiding dysfunction34\u201337.",

            "text": "Analyses of bladder function by FPA and cystometry in vivo, as well as of detrusor contractility by organ bath studies in vitro revealed differential phenotypes of voiding dysfunction between subgroups of CIE mice. Mice in C-RELAP group showed a delayed recovery of voiding function based on the number of large voiding spots. Additionally, in vitro contractility studies determined a decreased basal detrusor tone and reduced amplitude of nerve-mediated contractions in C-RELAP group, with purinergic responses of nerve-mediated contractions being up-regulated in C-RELAP group. These data provide evidence that animals with relapsing-remitting type of neurodegenerative changes in the CNS had the most severe type of voiding dysfunction in comparison to other groups. The differences in the types of bladder dysfunction between the CIE mice suggest that this animal model could be used for the testing of novel therapeutic approaches to treat LUTS based on the degree and phenotype of neurological impairments in MS patients38. The majority of currently available and widely used oral medications for neurogenic bladder dysfunction include the anti-muscarinic agents39. Muscarinic receptors predominately expressed in the urinary bladder are M2 and M3 subtypes known for their role in modulation of bladder reflexes38. However, due to observed up-regulation of purinergic responses in C-RELAP group and down-regulation of muscarinic responses in C-PRO group, conventional anti-muscarinic agents may have limited effects in respective groups of MS patients. Although purinergic receptor-mediated responses in the urinary bladder of MS patients40 and animals having demyelination41 had been previously mentioned, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. One publication showed that purinergic receptor P2X1 expression in the urinary bladder of mice with EAE-driven demyelination was significantly lower than in control mice42. Major nicotinic subtypes of receptors in the bladder urothelium are \u03b1-3 and \u03b17-isoforms which participate in regulation of bladder excitatory and inhibitory reflexes, respectively. Therefore, significant changes in slope values of relaxation (Sr) of both \u03b13- and \u03b17-mediated responses observed in C-RELAP group may explain why the C-RELAP mice showed irregular and atypical patterns of micturition cycle reflected in Fig. 4.",

Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with isofluorane (VEDCO, St. Albans, VT) and the bladder was exposed through a lower midline abdominal incision. A polyethylene tubing (PE-50, I.D. 0.58 mm, O.D. 0.96 mm; Intramedic, Becton Dickinson. Parsippany, NY) with a flared end was inserted through a puncture at the bladder dome, and sutured in place with purse string suture and 7.0 silk (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). The catheter was then tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized at the scapular region where it was sutured to the skin and filled with sterile saline solution. After confirming no leakage in the bladder, the catheter was plugged with a metal rod, and the muscle and skin layers were closed with a 5.0 silk suture (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). Particular care was taken not to stretch the bladder during the procedure or to restrict the normal bladder movement once the catheter was in place.",

Conscious mice were placed in the cystometry cages (length: 24 cm, width: 16 cm, and height: 12 cm) without restraint and allowed to acclimate for 30 min. The tip of the exteriorized bladder catheter, located at the base of the mouse neck, was connected to a pressure transducer and the infusion pump of the cystometry station (Small Animal Laboratory Cystometry, Catamount Research, and Development, St. Albans, VT) using a T-shaped valve. Room temperature saline solution (0.9% NaCl) was infused into the bladder at a rate of 10 \u03bcl/min. Voided urine was collected in a tray connected to a force displacement transducer, which integrated the results into the data-acquisition program. Each animal was observed for approximately six to eight voiding cycles. The urodynamic parameters were continuously recorded using the MED-CMG Small Animal Cystometry acquisition software and analyzed with the Cystometry Data Analysis software v 1.4 (Catamount Research and Development). The following cystometric parameters were evaluated: bladder capacity, pressure at the start of micturition, micturition rate, intravesical pressure, inter-micturition interval (presented as the ratio of the cycle duration in each of the experimental groups to the control group), and number of non-voiding contractions. Non-voiding contractions were defined as the increased values in detrusor pressure not associated with voiding, equal or larger than twice the mean value of baseline. Normal voiding contractions had amplitudes of at least a third of maximal pressure during a single micturition event.",

Briefly, murine urinary bladders were cut in half and placed in individual organ baths (Radnoti LLC, Monrovia, CA, USA), containing 7 ml of normal Tyrode Buffer (TB, in mM: NaCl 130.0, KCl 5.0, CaCl2 1.7, MgCl2 1.0, NaH2PO4 1.3, NaHCO3 17.0, Glucose, 10.0. pH 7.4) maintained at 37 \u00b0C and equilibrated with a constant supply of 95% O2\u20135% CO2. One end of each bladder strip was attached to a glass rod at the bottom of the organ chamber. The other end was attached to a force displacement transducer connected to a computerized system for data acquisition and analysis (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). After a 1 h equilibration, the length of optimal force development (Lo) was determined by manually increasing the length of each strip by ~1.5 mm increments until the maximal contractile force in response to electric field stimulation (EFS; 80 V, 32 Hz, 1 ms) was achieved. The bath solution was then changed to fresh TB containing the drugs to isolate cholinergic and purinergic responses after EFS stimulation. Intact bladder stips were used for each pharmacological evaluation to avoid desensitivation of cholinergic and purinergic receptors during the wash-off process between the drugs. The following drug combinations were used: 1 \u00b5M of atropine (non-selective mAChR antagonist, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) + 300 nM of TMPH (nicotinic antagonist, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom) were used to isolate the purinergic component of the contractile response; 30 \u00b5M of \u03b1,\u03b2-Methylene ATP (purinergic receptor desensitizer25, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom) was used to isolate the cholinergic component; 30 \u00b5M of \u03b1,\u03b2-Methylene ATP + 300 nM of TMPH (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom) were used to isolate the muscarinic component of contractions; 30 \u00b5M of \u03b1,\u03b2-Methylene ATP + 300 nM of TMPH + 1 \u00b5M of Methoctramine (M2 mAChR antagonist, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were used to isolate the M3 muscarinic component; 30 \u00b5M of \u03b1,\u03b2-Methylene ATP + 300 nM of TMPH + 10 \u00b5M of darifenacin (M3 mAChR antagonist, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were used to isolate M2 muscarinic component of contractions; 1 \u00b5M of atropine + 30 \u00b5M of \u03b1,\u03b2-Methylene ATP were used to isolate the nicotinic component; 1 \u00b5M of atropine + 30 \u00b5M of \u03b1,\u03b2-Methylene ATP + 1.4 nM of Methyllycaconitine Citrate (antagonist of \u03b1-7 nicotinic receptors, Tocis Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom) were used to isolate the \u03b13-mediated nicotinic component of contractions; 1 \u00b5M of atropine + 30 \u00b5M of \u03b1,\u03b2-Methylene ATP + 440 nM of TC 1698 (agonist of \u03b17 nicotinic receptors, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom) were used to isolate the \u03b17-mediated nicotinic component of contractions. After incubation of the bladder strips with these drugs for 15\u201320 minutes, the BSM were stimulated with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 Hz of EFS to evaluate the contractile responses. Some of the intact strips also underwent a KCl test (bath solution was replaced with TB containing 125 mM KCl) to evaluate muscle-mediated contractility of the detrusor in different experimental groups of animals. All BSM experiments were recorded and analyzed using LabChart 8 Pro (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices, LLC. San Jose CA, USA) and Matlab R2014b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The following parameters were measured and analyzed: basal muscle tone (in g/g, g of force per g of muscle strip weight), peak force (PF; in g or g/g when normalized to the weight of the muscle strip), integral force (IF) and maximal slope of contraction (Sc) or relaxation (Sr) phases as previously described38.",
