            "text": "As a first line of defence, the innate immune system protects cells against viral infections through production of type I IFNs. For successful infection and replication, viruses use a variety of strategies to evade the host innate immune system (reviewed by Randall & Goodbourn, 2008). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the mammalian pneumovirus most closely related to HMPV, uses two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2) as IFN antagonists (Spann et al., 2005). Homologues of NS1 and NS2 are absent in the genome of HMPV (van den Hoogen et al., 2002), indicating that HMPV must have a different strategy to evade the innate immune system. It has been suggested that HMPV is a strong activator of the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and/or mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) signalling pathways leading to IFN production (Ba\u00f1os-Lara et al., 2013; Bao et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2008). In contrast, the interaction of the attachment protein (G) of HMPV with RIG-I resulted in inhibition of RIG-I activation (Bao et al., 2008). However, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of G, an antagonistic role of G was not confirmed (Preston et al., 2012). Goutagny et al. (2010) reported that only NL/1/00 induced IFN production, in contrast to NL/1/99. Using the same virus strains, we could not reproduce IFN production upon NL/1/00 infection. These discrepancies between different studies led us to hypothesize that defective interfering RNAs (DIs) present in virus stocks may be responsible for the reported activation of the IFN pathway. DIs consist of partially deleted viral genomes that arise spontaneously when virus stocks are generated by passaging at high m.o.i. in mammalian cells, due to errors made by the replicase complex (Huang, 1973). The presence of DIs in virus stocks was reported in the 1960s and their generation by diverse DNA and RNA viruses has been widely documented (Rima et al., 1977; Sekellick & Marcus, 1978; Strahle et al., 2006). DIs with a \u2018copyback\u2019 or \u2018snapback\u2019 structure are strong IFN inducers, which correlates with their ability to self-anneal and form dsRNA (Sekellick & Marcus, 1978; Strahle et al., 2006). \u2018Copyback\u2019 types are generated during generation of the negative-sense strand by the replicase, which leaves its positive-sense template and resumes synthesis at the beginning of the \u2018daughter\u2019 genome negative-sense chain that it is still carrying. The complementary ends of the two chains are responsible for the circular \u2018panhandle\u2019 structures that these genomes form as naked RNA (Kolakofsky, 1976). \u2018Snapback\u2019 DIs are generated in a similar way to the \u2018copyback\u2019 DIs; however, the replicase does not only copy back the 3\u2032 end but also, when it crosses to the nascent strand, copies back the complete strand, resulting in a covalently linked positive- and negative-sense strand, forming a duplex (Lazzarini et al., 1981).",

            "text": "A549 cells were inoculated with these stocks as well as with sendai virus (SeV), measles virus Edmonston strain (MeV-Edm) and parainfluenza type 5 (PIV-5) as controls. PIV-5 does not activate the IFN pathway (Childs et al., 2012), whilst SeV (Cantell strain) and MeV-Edm are known to be strong inducers (Shingai et al., 2007; Strahle et al., 2006; Takaki et al., 2011). At 24 h after inoculation at an m.o.i. 3, the supernatants were tested for IFN content and compared with mock-inoculated cell supernatants. The supernatant of P2low-inoculated cells displayed similar low amounts of IFN to the supernatants of cells inoculated with PIV-5. In contrast, P5high-inoculated cells produced nearly as much IFN as SeV- or MeV-Edm-inoculated cells (Fig. 1). The lack of IFN induction by P2low was not due to a lower infection efficiency, as FACS analysis 24 h after inoculation revealed infection of more than 90 % of the cells for all viruses. HMPV NL/1/00 thus only activated the IFN pathway when virus stocks were prepared at a high m.o.i. The ability of SeV, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), MeV-Edm and PIV-5 to strongly activate the IFN pathway has been associated with the presence of DIs in these virus stocks (Baum et al., 2010; Killip et al., 2013; Marcus & Sekellick, 1977; Sekellick & Marcus, 1982). In addition, studies with VSV revealed that the IFN-inducing capacity of DIs was not affected by UV treatment (Marcus & Gaccione, 1989). UV treatment of P5high, P2low and SeV virus stocks resulted in reduced infection of A549 cells with P5high and SeV but did not affect IFN induction by these viruses. This suggested that the IFN induction by P5high may be attributed to the presence of DIs (Fig. S1, available in the online Supplementary Material).",

Mapping of the sequence reads against the full-length HMPV genome resulted in 28 121 and 8200 sequence reads for P2low and P5high, respectively. The genomes of P2low and P5high were covered with a mean of 588 and 168 reads per nucleotide, respectively. No coverage was obtained for the last 50 and 4 nt for P2low and P5high, respectively. In addition, the ends of the genomes were covered with fewer than 10 reads from nt 13 164 for P2low and from nt 13 325 for P5high. Fig. 2(a), depicting the ratio between the depths of sequence obtained for P2low and for P5high per nucleotide position, demonstrates that, at the end of the genome, P5high displayed a greater depth of sequence than P2low. From nucleotide 11 726 onwards, P5high displayed up to 31 times more depth of sequence than P2low. In fact, for P5high 16.3 % of the 8200 reads mapped to the region beyond position 11 kb of the genome, compared with only 2.2 % of 28 121 reads obtained for P2low. Examination of the P5high reads at this part of the genome revealed the presence of reads that only aligned for approximately 50 % with the reference sequence. Subsequent blast searches conducted with all sequence reads mapping for at least 20 % to the reference sequence revealed the presence of reads that contained two copies of (almost) the same genome region: one part of the read mapped to the genomic negative-sense sequence and the other part mapped to the antigenomic positive-sense sequence of the viral genome, with the two parts being complementary. In total, 47 dsRNA structures were identified in P5high and none in P2low. All 47 reads aligned to the region upstream of position 11 200 of the viral genome, the same region where P5high displayed deeper coverage than P2low. Alignment of these reads revealed 12 unique structures that differed in sequence and position, as shown in Fig. 2(b). As assignment of the orientation of the two strands could not be carried out based on the deep-sequencing results, the assignment was based on the results obtained in the blast search. The complementarity of the two strands indicated that P5high contained DIs with a \u2018snapback\u2019 structure. The 12 DIs had variable lengths of the single-stranded parts at the cross-over point (i.e. the position where the polymerase switches from the template to the daughter strand and where the positive- and negative-sense strands of the DI are connected). No specific sequence motif was detected at the position of cross-over points that may have served as a signal for the polymerase to switch strands. Table S1 depicts the exact positions of all DIs compared with the viral genome.",

The deep-sequencing and bioinformatics approach only identified a read as a DI if the read overlapped with a cross-over point. All DI reads were too short to reach from the cross-over point to the trailer sequences or the reverse complement thereof. To test whether the double-stranded structures detected with deep sequencing were indeed DIs with a \u2018snapback\u2019 structure, we performed electrophoresis of viral RNA and Northern blotting using a probe complementary to the trailer. The Northern blot assay demonstrated the presence of similar amounts of full-length viral genome in P5high and P2low (Fig. 3, top band) with an additional band of approximately 7 kb detected in both virus stocks. The identity of the 7 kb fragment is unknown. In addition to these large RNA molecules, smaller RNAs ranging in size from 0.5 to 4 kb were detected but only in P5high. As the RNA was analysed on denaturing gels, fragments of this size may represent DIs, double-stranded in nature, of 0.25\u20132 kb.

The location of hypermutations matched with the region where P5high displayed more sequence depth than P2low and where DIs were detected. In the region downstream of nt 11 000, 53.6 % of the A residues in the reference sequence displayed mutation to G and 35.7 % of the T residues displayed mutation to C (in at least 2 % of the reads mapping to that position) (Fig. 4b, c).

They found that ADAR editing of A\u2192I was more likely when the 5\u2032 neighbour was U, followed by A, C and G (U>A>C>G). The 3\u2032 preference was less specific, with a different preference for each of the four ADARs they considered and equal preference for some nucleotides. We analysed all reads (n = 954) mapping downstream of nt 11 000 for the editing probability depending on the 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-neighbour nucleotide. The mean edit probability for each of the 16 combinations of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 neighbours of an edited A or T was calculated. No pattern was identified for the 3\u2032-neighbouring nucleotide. In contrast, the 5\u2032-neighbour preference was in accordance with the probabilities as described for ADAR (Eggington et al., 2011), and was the same for A\u2192G and T\u2192C mutation (Fig. 4d).",

APOBEC deaminates C to U on ssDNA or RNA. APOBEC-induced specific C\u2192U editing has been described for retroviruses and DNA viruses but not for RNA viruses (Bransteitter et al., 2009). Commercial gene expression assays did not detect expression of APOBEC mRNA in our Vero-118 cells (data not shown), whilst we did detect ADAR mRNAs. ADAR binds to dsRNA and deaminates A to I, which, during replication, is recognized as a G (Bass, 2002). Three ADAR genes have been identified, of which two have editing activity, ADAR1 and ADAR2. The IFN-inducible ADAR1-p150 resides in the cytoplasm, whilst the constitutively expressed ADAR1-p110 and ADAR2 reside in the nucleus (George et al., 2011). For viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of the infected host cell, such as HMPV, ADAR1-p150 is the most likely protein responsible for A\u2192I editing (Samuel, 2011). We did not observe a clear upregulation of ADAR1-p150 mRNA in IFN-treated Vero-118 cells, and only a low level of upregulation of protein in IFN-treated A549 and Vero cells. In accordance, in studies detecting expression of endogenous ADAR1-p150, only low expression levels were observed (Cavarec et al., 2013). Vero-118 cells are IFN deficient (Desmyter et al., 1968), which would argue against a role for ADAR1-p150. However, despite the absence of IFN genes in Vero cells, it is well known that expression of IFN-stimulated genes (e.g. ISG56) can be upregulated in an IFN-independent manner (G\u00e9linas et al., 2011). We did observe upregulation of ISG56 mRNA upon SeV or P5high inoculation of Vero-118 cells (Fig. S7). Tripathi et al. (2014) found indications for IFN-independent induction of ADAR expression through the concerted action of IRF3 and IRF7, although the induction levels were low. However, the promoter that initiates the ADAR1-p150 transcript has a basal constitutive activity, which may be sufficient for editing activity (Patterson & Samuel, 1995).",
