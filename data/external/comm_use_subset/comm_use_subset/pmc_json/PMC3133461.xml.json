            "text": "The ability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to rapidly generate mutants and evade immune response is the major obstacle for development of protective, prophylactic HIV-1 vaccines. Therefore, candidate vaccine immunogens must be capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that inhibit viruses from different genetic subtypes. Several human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) such as b12 [1], X5 [2], 2G12 [3], 2F5 and 4E10 [4,5] exhibit potent and broad HIV-1 neutralizing activity in vitro and can prevent HIV-1 infection in animal models [6]. These bnAbs target structures on HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) that are crucial for virus-cell fusion. Therefore, Envs in various formats are potential candidate immunogens and have been evaluated in animal models and human clinical trials [7\u201310]. However, neutralization efficacy of the resulting sera as broad as that by those bnAbs has not been achieved by empirically using these Envs as immunogens [11]. It has been suggested that characterization of the epitopes of the bnAbs could help design vaccine immunogens that would be able to elicit these bnAbs or similar antibodies in vivo [12]. Although this approach is being vigorously pursued, none of the immunogens designed has yet efficiently elicited neutralizing antibodies with broad specificity.",

Activation of IgM-expressing B cells provides impetus for in vivo IgM-to-IgG isotype switch resulting in production of high-affinity neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies. It is therefore important to investigate the human IgM repertoire for HIV-1 Env-specific antibodies and understand how they interact with HIV-1 Envs and impact on viral infection which could help design effective immunogens. Previous attempts to select HIV-specific antibodies by use of non-immune libraries have resulted in antibodies with modest neutralizing activity and limited breadth of neutralization [13]. Studies by several groups show that human IgM antibodies play important roles not only in shaping humoral immunity against HIV-1 but also in inducing cell-mediated response because of their pentameric binding nature as well as their very efficient activity to activate complement. Tor\u00e1n et al. [14] indicated that in vivo IgM-to-IgG isotype switch and affinity maturation may be important for protection and long-term survival in certain HIV-1-infected individuals. Sheppard et al. [15] demonstrated that complement-deactivated serum from a healthy volunteer immunized with an HIV-1 clade C gp120 exhibited IgM-associated neutralizing activity that was significantly enhanced in the presence of fresh normal human serum as a source of complement. Bomsel et al. [16] showed that a human anti-HIV-1 gp41 IgM monoclonal antibody blocked the transcytotic route of HIV mucosal transmission in vitro.",

The phagemid used for library construction, pZYD-N1, was synthesized and briefly described previously [17]. To approximately estimate the sequence diversity of m21, 44 clones were randomly selected from the library and sequenced. No identical sequences of heavy and light chains were found; more than 80% of the clones are productive. Of the 44 clones 26 had kappa light chains and the other 18 - lambda light chains. M21 was panned against several HIV-1 Envs and human cancer-related antigens; significant enrichment was obtained with all the pannings (data not shown). These results indicate that the quality of the library is likely to be good.",

One of the selected antibody clones, R3H1, contained a TGA stop codon at the very beginning of the light chain due to a nucleotide deletion that resulted in reading-frame shift. The heavy chain variable domain (VH) of R3H1, designated m0, differs from the closest human germline sequence (VH3\u201323) by mutations distributed in all frameworks (FRs) and complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (Figure 1a). M0 contains 15 mutations in nucleotide sequence of the variable (V) region resulting in 9 mutations in amino acid sequence. We corrected the reading frame of the light chain by site-directed mutagenesis and the corrected antibody, designated R3H1m, was expressed at high levels in bacteria as an Fab. Fab R3H1m specifically bound with relatively high affinity to gp140R2 (EC50, \u223c60 nM) and the gp140 of a clade C isolate, GXC44 (gp140GXC44) (EC50, \u223c100 nM).",

In agreement with our hypothesis it specifically bound to gp140R2 although with low affinity (EC50, >1000 nM). We further constructed a light chain-shuffling Fab library (3 \u00d7 107 members) based on the heavy chain of R3H1. To increase the probability for selection of cross-reactive antibodies the library was panned sequentially against gp140R2 and the gp140 of a clade F isolate, 14/00/4 (gp14014/00/4). Five unique clones were identified that contained exclusively lambda light chains (Figure 1b). They bound to gp140R2 and gp14014/00/4 with EC50 ranging from 2 to 80 nM (Table 1) while no significant binding to an unrelated antigen, bovine serum albumin (BSA), was observed (data not shown). One of the antibodies, m19, also bound with high affinity to the Envs of other three clade B isolates, gp120Bal, gp140JRFL and gp140Con-S [19]. These results suggest that m19 and possibly the other selected antibodies target conserved epitopes on gp120.",

When Bal was tested, the enhancing activity of scFv m19 was comparable to that of Fab m19 and slightly lower than that of m19Fc (data not shown). These data indicate that the antibody access to the epitope was not size-restricted and that the bivalency of the Fc fusion protein strengthened the antibody activity probably due to avidity effects. The ability of m19Fc to modulate HIV-1 infection in vitro was further tested with six additional clade B isolates and an isolate each from clade A and clade C, respectively (Figure 3). Enhancement was observed with JRCSF (clade B, R5) at very low m19Fc concentration and the enhancement was decreased with an increase in antibody concentration. M19Fc also conferred slight enhancement of infection by JRFL (clade B, R5) and 92UG037.8 (clade A, R5) at about 200 nM antibody concentration. It neutralized the clade B X4 isolates IIIB and NL4-3. It also neutralized R2, which is a clade B R5 isolate, displays some CD4 independence and is moderately neutralization sensitive, as well as GXC44 which is a clade C R5 isolate. No significant antibody activity was observed with the dual tropic clade B isolate 89.6. These results indicate that the antibody activity in terms of neutralization or enhancement varies when different isolates are tested and is not significantly correlated with the coreceptor usage and the CD4 dependency of the viruses in entry.",

            "text": "To approximately localize the antibody epitopes and begin to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of antibody neutralizing or enhancing activity, we measured the antibody binding to Envs from different isolates alone and in complex with CD4 as well as the antibody competition with well-characterized antibodies. M19Fc bound to a single-chain polypeptide analogue of the HIV-1 gp120-CD4 complex (gp120Bal-CD4) [20] with threefold higher affinity (EC50, \u223c2.5 nM) than to gp120Bal (EC50, \u223c10 nM) alone as measured by an ELISA (Figure 4a). It did not react with sCD4 suggesting that the antibody targeted a structure on gp120 that was outside the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) and could undergo CD4-induced (CD4i) conformational changes. The conformational changes on gp120Bal after CD4 binding were confirmed by a CD4i bnAb, m9Fc [21], which exhibited dramatically higher binding to gp120Bal-CD4 than to gp120Bal (Figure 4a). To find out whether the antibody bound to the conventional CD4i epitopes, we used gp140Con-S, which was a synthetic Env designed by aligning the consensus Env sequences of group M [19]. This Env, by design, is composed by shorter V1, V2, V4 and V5 loops and therefore, might expose regions around the variable loops that might contain conserved neutralizing determinants. However, m9 epitope as a representative for CD4i epitopes is still completely hidden on gp140Con-S because m9Fc did not bind in the absence of sCD4, it did bind with high affinity in the presence of sCD4 (Figure 4b). However, m19Fc showed comparable binding to gp140Con-S with or without sCD4 (Figure 4b) suggesting that the antibody does not precisely target CD4i epitopes but other structures on the gp120. Although m19Fc was not directed against the CD4-binding pocket, it strongly competed with the CD4bs bnAb, scFv b12, which has binding surface larger than that of CD4 [22] (Figure 5a). M19Fc also competed although weakly with two CD4i antibodies, scFv m9 and m36 [17] (Figure 5b). These results suggest that the epitope of m19Fc is in very close proximity to the CD4bs and the coreceptor-binding site (CORbs) which overlaps with CD4i epitopes on gp120 (Figure 6).",

No obvious interaction was observed with scFv m19gem when several Envs that bound the original m19 were tested (data not shown). Previous studies showed that the binding activity of an antibody in the form of Fab or scFv could be increased up to thousands of times when it is converted to dimeric formats such as an IgG. We therefore fused scFv m19gem to the Fc portion of a human IgG1 to gain possible avidity effects. Still, the Fc-fusion protein of scFv m19gem (m19gemFc) did not show measurable binding to the Envs with or without sCD4 (Figure 7). These results suggest that significant somatic diversification is required for the m19 corresponding germline antibody to achieve recognition of the m19 epitope on gp120. They also indicate that in some individuals certain IgM antibodies could undergo somatic hypermutations to relatively high-affinity binders to the Env in the absence of HIV-1 infection or immunization with Env.",

            "text": "Vaccines based on recombinant Envs have failed to prevent viral infection in human efficacy trials likely because of their inability to elicit neutralizing antibodies that are broad enough to combat the extremely high variability of the virus. Recent success was reported but it is modest and needs to be repeated and further examined [23]. To date only several bnAbs have been isolated from HIV-1 patients suggesting difficulties to elicit such antibodies in vivo. However, the presence of epitopes recognized by these bnAbs on Envs argues that they are still a potential template for vaccine design. Different strategies aiming at improving the presentation of neutralizing epitopes are rigorously pursued. Analysis of the structures of Envs shows that most of their surface is hidden from humoral immune responses by glycosylation and oligomeric occlusion [24,25]. The CD4bs and the CORbs on gp120 are also flanked by loop structures which may further limit the access by antibodies generated by the human immune system [24,25]. Therefore, one strategy focuses on the use of modified Envs, in which the variable loops have been deleted [26\u201329] or glycosylation removed [30,31] or both [32] in order to increase the exposure of the neutralizing epitopes. Based on the finding that the neutralizing capacity of the antibodies is associated with their ability to bind to native trimeric Envs on the virus but does not correlate with binding to isolated monomeric Envs, another strategy focuses on preservation or re-construction of the functional trimeric Envs [33,34]. The essential concept is that immunizing with a close mimic of the functional trimer will improve the chances of eliciting neutralizing antibodies. Yet another strategy is to use fusion intermediates formed during virus entry [35,36] or their mimics [37]. HIV-1 entry is initiated by binding of viral gp120 with the receptor CD4 and a coreceptor on the target cell surface. These interactions lead to intermediate Env conformations that may include conserved structures useful for vaccine design. However, elicitation of desirable level and breath of neutralizing antibodies with the immunogens generated based on these strategies has not been achieved. While modification of Envs based solely on the analysis of the interaction with neutralizing antibodies is not sufficient to create effective vaccines, we propose that the inherent capacity of the human immune system in response to HIV-1 infection should be explored. We have hypothesized that investigation of human IgM repertoire for HIV-1 Env-specific antibodies and understanding how they react with Envs, evolve and impact on viral infection would help design effective HIV-1 immunogens.",

            "text": "It has been previously found that IgM-based response confers substantial effects on HIV-1 infection which are especially relevant in the context of acute infection [14\u201316]. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of several high-affinity human IgM-derived mAbs against HIV-1 from phage-displayed naive human antibody libraries constructed from healthy donors. Although their potency in vitro appears minor the roles they could play in mediating HIV-1 infection in vivo should not be underestimated. IgM antibodies are highly effective in activating complement system to destroy the virus or infected cells. The antibodies selected in this study target highly conserved regions on gp120 which are in very close proximity to the CD4bs and the CORbs. Because these two regions on gp120 are vital for virus entry and harbor neutralizing epitopes, HIV-1 has evolved strategies such as steric occlusion to protect it from humoral immunity [24,25]. Here we suggest that the possible high immunogenicity of the conserved non-neutralizing epitopes of these antibodies could further divert the immune system from responses to neutralizing epitopes. Recent studies [38,39] showed that cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies (IgMs and IgGs) were elicited by immunizing mice with recombinant HIV-1 gp140s suggesting the same possibility in humans. Because the antibodies we selected are less divergent (totally about 15 amino acid mutations in the V gene products for the heavy and light chains) (Figure 1) than the known bnAbs which all contain extensive somatic mutations (on average >30 mutations) compared to germline antibodies (data not shown), they could be more easily elicited. In addition, these antibodies could directly block the access of some neutralizing antibodies generated by the human immune system, especially those targeting the CD4bs or CORbs. This was supported by our finding that m19Fc partially reversed the neutralization by a CD4i antibody, m36 [17] (data not shown). These results further support previous propositions to reduce the immunogenicity of unwanted epitopes when gp120/gp140 is used as an immunogen.",

We observed similar lack of binding of germline-like b12, 2F5 and 2G12 to Envs [40\u201342]. Moreover, we found that there was a lack of or no high-affinity binders to Envs in the germline-like antibody repertoire of the human cord blood whereas high-affinity antibodies against other human infectious agents including SARS coronavirus and henipaviruses could be easily selected (Weizao Chen, Emily Streaker and Dimiter S. Dimitrov, in preparation). The identified antibodies against SARS coronavirus protein S exhibited nanomolar affinity and were very close to germline in sequence. By analyzing the previously identified antibody sequences we found that all of the cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 were highly diversified from their germline sequences; in contrast, the antibodies against SARS coronavirus and henipaviruses had only limited number of mutations [40\u201342]. These results indicate that extensive somatic mutations could be required for high-affinity binding to conserved HIV-1 Env structures. One could speculate that the maturation pathways for some HIV-1 antibodies are initiated by immunogens that are different from the Envs; such immunogens could be used in combination with Env-based immunogens to guide the immune system for elicitation of potent bnAbs by additional somatic hypermutation and selection. This is in line with our proposition to elicit bnAbs by using one or more primary immunogens that are different than Envs but can lead to intermediates on the maturation pathways that can be subsequently further somatically hypermutated to matured bnAbs [40\u201342].",

            "text": "Except for the conventional antigen-antibody interaction, gp120s also bind to a small population of human antibodies containing products of mainly VH3 gene family and exhibit superantigen properties by activating the human B cells expressing such antibodies on cellular membrane [43]. The core motif of the superantigen-binding site (SBS) on gp120 is a discontinuous structure spanning the V4 variable domain and the amino-terminal region flanking the C4 constant domain [44]. The determinants on the antibody VH domains critical for gp120 binding are not clear yet while the putative important regions were identified in the FR1 and 3; a modeling study showed that most of the potential contact residues were located on the face of the VHs opposite to the interface for interaction with light chain; other positions in the CDR1 and 2 also influenced the binding [45]. Moreover, the gp120-positive antibody VH genes showed >96% similarity to the germlines suggesting that the somatic hypermutations may have adverse effects on gp120 binding [45]. The antibodies described in this study contained VH3-23 gene products (Figure 1a) and therefore, their high binding could be due to the superantigen-like interactions. However, our results showed that the isolated VH of these antibodies, m0, bound to gp120s with affinity (EC50, >1000 nM) much lower than that (EC50, 2\u201380 nM) of the Fabs. In addition, the epitope of one (m19) of these antibodies was mapped to a structure in very close proximity to the CD4bs and the CORbs on gp120 but not to the defined SBS. These results suggest that the majority, if not all, of the binding activities of the selected antibodies should be contributed by the conventional antigen-antibody recognition.",

            "text": "One should note that these antibodies may not represent the native ones because they were selected from phage libraries where the heavy and light chains of the antibodies are randomly recombined. However, previous studies [46\u201348] have shown that selection of high-affinity antibodies from such libraries results in antibodies which are identical or very similar to those occurring in the host from which the libraries are made. It has been shown that at least in some systems the antigen selected antibodies such as the autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) from large random phage libraries have the same pairings as those from small libraries where the cognate pairing is preserved and that pairing between light and heavy chain is not promiscuous [49,50]. The study by Chapal et al. [48] directly demonstrates that antibodies derived from combinatorial libraries are likely to represent in vivo pairings, leading to high affinity antibody fragments mimicking the binding of serum autoantibodies to TPO. De Wildt et al. [51] analyzed the cognate pairings of heavy and light chain variable domains in 365 human IgG+ B cells from peripheral blood and established that the pairings are largely random. The antibodies we selected were originated from large families of genes \u2013 heavy chain from VH3 and light chain from VL1 (Figure 1). Importantly, the pairings for two of them, m19 and m19d, have been found in the very limited number (365) of truly human antibodies previously analyzed [51]. Moreover, some (e.g., m19 and m19b) of these antibodies are relatively close to their corresponding germlines (Figure 1). These data suggest the possibility of eliciting such antibodies in vivo during HIV-1 infection or gp120-based immunization.",

Pseudotyped viruses were obtained after 48 h by centrifugation and filtration of cell culture through 0.45 \u03bcm filters. For neutralization, viruses were mixed with different concentrations of antibodies for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, and then the mixture was added to about 1.5 \u00d7 104 HOS-CD4-CCR5 (used for all R5 and dual tropic viruses) or HOS-CD4-CXCR4 cells grown in each well of 96-well plates. Luminesence was measured after 48 h by using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) and a LumiCount microplate luminometer (Turner Designs). Mean relative light units (RLU) for duplicate wells were determined. Relative infectivity (%) was calculated by the following formula: (average RLU of antibody-containing wells/average RLU of virus-only wells) \u00d7 100.",
