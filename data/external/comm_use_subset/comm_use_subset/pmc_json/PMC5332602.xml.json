            "text": "Malnutrition, alone or combined with enteric infections, contributes to almost half of all deaths of children under 5 years old (1). Initiated by protein deprivation, the ensuing intestinal dysbiosis, epithelial breaches, altered metabolism, and compromised immune system (1, 2) promote pathogen/pathobiont invasion, leading to environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in malnourished children (3). The resulting persistent diarrhea remains the second most common cause of childhood death in the developing world. The multifactorial pathobiology of childhood malnutrition and the associated EED is best described as a vicious cycle of impaired immunity, recurrent enteric infections, intestinal inflammation, and malabsorption that, in turn, worsens malnutrition. Protein deficiency and dysbiotic intestinal microbiota are major contributors to kwashiorkor (clinically manifested by stunting and edema) and \u201chidden hunger\u201d or micronutrient deficiencies, further compromising immunity and the epithelial barrier (1). The self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal epithelial stem cells (IESCs) regulate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) homeostasis and turnover (4). Childhood protein deficiency impairs IESC functions, compromising the host\u2019s ability to repair the intestinal epithelium upon intestinal injury or infection (5). Therefore, IESC dysfunction may represent one of the key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of malnutrition and EED. Historically, childhood malnutrition studies have focused on understanding its effects on health, metabolism, and susceptibility to enteric or respiratory infections. Rodent models, commonly used to study single nutrient deficiencies, do not recapitulate all of the clinical, immunological, and molecular parameters of malnutrition and are of uncertain relevance in the modeling of the increased infection rates seen in malnourished human populations (6). Studies of Malawian twins discordant for kwashiorkor in Gn mouse/pig models demonstrated a causal microbiota-dependent relationship between mother-derived nutrients, including milk oligosaccharides, and neonatal growth, nutritional status, metabolism, and organ morphology (7, 8).",

Although there are inconsistent findings on the interactions between RV and malnutrition (11\u201314), increased human RV (HRV) disease severity and vaccine failures (15) in developing countries are generally associated with reduced immune function stemming from intestinal dysbiosis, nutrient deficiencies, and environmental enteropathy. However, contradictory evidence comes from a longitudinal study of a birth cohort in Bangladesh that demonstrated a positive association between healthy dwelling and adequate nutritional status of infants with the risk of symptomatic RV infection (16). This observation may be related to the preexisting damage of the intestinal epithelium of infants who had clinical or subclinical malnutrition and may therefore lack the target mature enterocytes that support HRV infection. These studies necessitate further research to understand the complex molecular mechanisms of the interactions among malnutrition, immune function, and intestinal homeostasis.",

Edema of the face, neck, feet, and abdominal area (commonly observed in human cases of kwashiorkor) developed at 10 days of age and persisted throughout the duration of the experiments in protein-deficient pigs but not in protein-sufficient pigs. Comparison of blood parameters at the termination of the experiment revealed that pigs on the protein-deficient diet had significantly decreased levels of glucose, total protein, and albumin (Fig. 2, HIFM/HRV-infected pigs on deficient and sufficient diets; no-HRV/no-HIFM controls, data not shown), as seen in malnourished children (which develop because of malnutrition itself and malabsorption associated with malnutrition). However, these trends were opposite early after HRV inoculation (postinfection day 2 [PID2]) (data not shown). Additionally, serum vitamin A, vitamin E, and selenium levels were significantly increased at the end of the experiment in protein-deficient groups but not in protein-sufficient groups, suggestive of a positive \u201c30-day response\u201d (as seen in vitamin A-deficient children [17]) to supplementation of these micronutrients in the diet. The mortality rate of the HIFM-transplanted piglets on a protein-sufficient diet (no HRV) did not exceed 14% (1 piglet/litter, on average), whereas the mortality rates of the HIFM-transplanted piglets (no HRV) on the protein-deficient diet ranged between 15 and 45% (Table 1). The clinical signs in the affected piglets were consistent with hypoglycemia and septicemia in addition to extraintestinal (liver, kidney, lung, and peritoneal cavity swabs) recovery of Clostridium perfringens type A and nonhemolytic, avirulent Escherichia coli (bacterial identification to the species level was conducted at the Ohio Department of Agriculture).",

The neonatal pigs infected with HRV at 3 days after HIFM transplantation had poor health (weight loss, lethargy, neurological signs including ataxia, diarrhea, a moribund state, loss of appetite, and transient fever), high mortality rates (45 to 75%, Table 1), and enhanced HRV shedding/diarrhea, unlike pigs infected at 10 days after HIFM transplantation or germfree (GF) pigs (Fig. 3). Although fecal HRV shedding was comparable at PID0 to PID2, it was higher in deficient pigs thereafter following early HRV infection (Fig. 3A). Similarly, diarrhea was more severe and persisted in deficient pigs through experiment termination at PID5 (Fig. 3A). By PID5 after early HRV infection, most (75%) of the pigs died and the surviving ones failed to thrive or had recurrent fever or mild neurological symptoms, irrespective of the diet, and were euthanized. Comparison of early immunological parameters did not reveal consistent trends. Therefore, to avoid the adverse reactions and an excessively high mortality rate, all of the pigs in the subsequent experiments were inoculated with HRV at 10 days after HIFM transplantation.",

Additionally, we observed extensive epithelial vacuolization in nontransplanted compared to HIFM-transplanted pigs, irrespective of the diet (Fig. 4). To further assess the epithelial barrier integrity of pigs in different experimental groups, we compared villin expression by IECs. Consistent with the above, the latter was higher in sufficient pigs and decreased in deficient pigs (Fig. 5). Finally, we measured serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels (at the termination of the experiment) to evaluate the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. The results demonstrated that serum LPS levels were significantly higher in protein-deficient (HIFM/HRV) pigs (Fig. 6).",

Protein deficiency decreased the frequencies of natural killer (NK) cells among intestinal (significantly) and splenic (numerically) mononuclear cells (MNCs) and significantly decreased the NK function of splenic MNCs (Fig. 9). Similarly, frequencies of intestinal plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and CD103+ MNCs were significantly lower in protein-deficient pigs than in protein-sufficient pigs. Finally, the frequencies of apoptotic MNCs were also lower in all of the tissues of protein-deficient pigs (Fig. 10). Although there was a trend for increased levels of most innate cytokines evaluated in serum samples at different time points (data not shown), only IL-12 p40 (referred to as IL-12 throughout) levels were consistently higher in serum samples from protein-sufficient pigs than in those from protein-deficient pigs throughout the duration of the experiment (Fig. 11). No differences in the levels of Toll-like receptor expression by MNCs were noted in any tissues of protein-sufficient or -deficient pigs (data not shown).

Stunting of the pigs on the deficient diet that were transplanted with sHIFM or dHIFM was indistinguishable from that of pigs transplanted with dHIFM. Likewise sHIFM failed to rescue pigs on a deficient diet from stunting.

Subsequently, EED compromises gut morphology and barrier and immune functions, contributing to the systemic spread of intestinal pathogens, commensals, and pathobionts (1, 2, 24). Thus, EED contributes to persistent systemic and intestinal inflammation, further exacerbating malnutrition and intestinal permeability and negatively affecting overall health (1, 5, 25).

Additionally, we demonstrated that these parameters were present but less evident in GF pigs than in HIFM-transplanted protein-deficient pigs, which suggests that altered microbiota associated with protein malnutrition (with increased Firmicutes levels and Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios [A. Kumar et al., unpublished data]) could compete with the host for limited dietary resources. Different compositions of the intestinal microbiomes of healthy and malnourished infants and children from developed and developing countries are mostly characterized by decreased microbiome abundance and diversity (or persistent microbiome immaturity), an increased prevalence of \u201cinflammogenic\u201d bacterial taxa and a higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, as well as persistent intestinal colonization by pathogenic/pathobiont bacteria (28). Further, while Prevotella was the predominant microbial community signature in healthy children from developing countries (Malawi, Bangladesh, and Venezuela) Bacteroides predominated in the North American healthy microbiomes, suggesting geographical and nutritional disparities (29, 30). In this study, we used a fecal transplant from a healthy exclusively breastfed (to minimize dietary variations between developed and developing countries of the respective age group) United States infant to evaluate the role of protein malnutrition in initiating enteric and immune dysfunction, including intestinal dysbiosis. Because protein-deficient HIFM-transplanted pigs with or without HRV were more stunted than protein-deficient GF pigs infected with HRV, we conclude that the altered microbiota and not HRV infection alone plays a major role in the development of stunting in protein deficiency.",

Thus, unlike in our model of prenatal vitamin A deficiency (single-micronutrient deficiency) (31), protein deficiency affected the levels or homeostatic control of multiple macro- and micronutrients, limiting the ability of neonatal pigs to adapt/maintain homeostasis through compensatory mechanisms. This is in agreement with the uniform suppression of the various innate immune parameters evaluated in this study and associated with protein deficiency versus concurrent up- or downregulation of those in vitamin A-deficient pigs (31).",

            "text": "The increased HRV shedding and severity of diarrhea that we observed in protein-deficient pigs are consistent with most previous observations (1, 24, 32\u201335). The characteristic second peak of HRV shedding occurs when newly differentiated enterocytes repopulating the small intestinal villi become infected with HRV (36, 37). Thus, the absence of a second shedding peak in the deficient pigs may be suggestive of the inability to replenish the intestinal epithelium with newly generated/migrated enterocytes, potentially reflecting defects in IESC function. In this study, a protein-deficient diet combined with HIFM transplantation and HRV infection resulted in a uniform decrease in the mRNA levels of all of the IEC markers evaluated (CgA, SOX9, PCNA, MUC2, and villin). This, together with decreases in the numbers of IECs expressing the respective markers and villous atrophy (M. A. Alhamo et al., unpublished data), suggests the most profound perturbation of intestinal epithelial homeostasis characterized by inhibition of IEC turnover and regeneration rates, effects consistent with the most severe clinical outcomes observed. In contrast, protein deficiency in HIFM-transplanted noninfected piglets or in HRV-infected GF piglets resulted in decreased MUC2/villin and MUC2/PCNA/SOX9/villin gene mRNA levels, respectively, while the CgA/PCNA/SOX9 and CgA gene mRNA levels were increased. IESCs (SOX9+), transient amplifying progenitor cells (PCNA+), and enteroendocrine cells (CgA+) respond to intestinal insults by enhancing epithelial proliferation and repair. Therefore, the increase in the expression of these respective markers may represent different compensatory mechanisms that are being initiated upon single or dual intestinal insults (protein deficiency plus altered microbiota or protein deficiency plus HRV infection). However, multifactorial insults to the intestinal epithelium (protein deficiency plus HRV plus altered microbiota) likely exhaust its ability to adapt by using alternative biological mechanisms. Finally, our observations suggest that the intestinal microbiota enhances epithelial proliferation and IEC barrier function, which is evident from the higher PCNA and villin mRNA levels in HIFM-transplanted pigs than in GF pigs.",

Additionally, we demonstrated that optimal NK cell responses against HRV were dependent on efficient IL-12 cytokine production (39). Consistent with that, protein deficiency in this study resulted in decreased NK cell frequencies/function and serum IL-12 levels. CD103+ intestinal DCs are necessary to prime and confer intestinal homing of B and T lymphocytes (40). The decrease in CD103+ expression on MNCs observed in this study likely contributed to the defective adaptive immune responses of the protein-deficient pigs (D. D. Fischer et al., unpublished data). The frequencies of apoptotic MNCs correlated with the levels of HRV replication in our previous experiments because HRV induces apoptosis of immune and epithelial host cells. Apoptosis of immune cells must be properly regulated to maintain immune homeostasis (41). The decrease in the frequencies of apoptotic MNCs observed in protein-deficient pigs in this study despite higher HRV replication further suggests enhanced activation of survival signaling pathways in MNCs from protein-deficient pigs. For example, in protein-deficient mice, the expression of intestinal cell kinase (a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that potently activates proproliferation and prosurvival pathways of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin) was increased while cellular apoptosis decreased in a caspase-dependent manner, providing a protective compensatory mechanism during nutritional stress (42).",

All of the pigs were maintained, sampled, and euthanized humanely. Euthanasia was performed by electrocution following anesthesia. For this study, we used the lowest number of pigs previously shown to permit the detection of statistically significant differences among treatments (44, 45). Near-term sows (Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire \u00d7 Duroc cross-bred) were purchased from the Ohio State University Swine Center facility. Caesarean-derived Gn piglets were maintained in sterile isolators as previously described (4). Nursing piglets may consume between 100 and 900 ml of sow milk, which contains 5% protein, 8% fat, and 5% carbohydrates (CHO), per day. To avoid differences in nutrient intake between different groups/litters in this study, the diet intake was restricted throughout experiments. We fed gradually increasing volumes (500 to 800 ml/day) of Parmalat (bovine whole milk containing 3.3% protein, 3.3% fat, and 5% CHO) to piglets in the sufficient-diet group to provide adequate amounts of protein and fat and increased amounts of CHO compared to the daily consumption of sow milk. Similar to the 50% dietary restriction described by Zijlstra et al. (46), piglets in the deficient-diet groups were fed increasing volumes (500 to 800 ml/day) of Parmalat milk mixed with sterile water (50:50, vol/vol), which resulted in a protein content twice as low as that of the sufficient-diet groups. Prior to HIFM transplantation, sterility was verified by aerobic and anaerobic culturing of rectal swabs to ensure that there was no bacterial or fungal contamination. Additionally, all piglets were confirmed to be negative for RV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, calicivirus/sapovirus, astrovirus, and kobuvirus (47\u201351). Neonatal piglets from eight litters (12 to 16 pigs/litter) were assigned to different treatment groups (Table 2) to conduct pilot and main experiments.",

The efficiency of HIFM transplantation and the similarity of the microbial compositions of the original infant and Gn pig fecal samples was confirmed by 16S metagenomic (V4-V5 region sequencing) analysis based on open operational taxonomic unit picking by using the GreenGenes 16S rRNA reference database (2013-08 release) as described elsewhere (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (53, 54). Rectal swabs were collected daily (for 8 days) from HRV Wa-inoculated piglets (1 \u00d7 106 focus-forming units [FFU]/dose) starting at PID0 to assess HRV shedding and to record fecal scores to assess the severity of diarrhea. The piglets in the early and late HRV groups were euthanized at PID5 and PID14, respectively. Blood, duodenum, ileum, and spleen tissues were collected to isolate MNCs as described previously (55). Serum samples collected at the end of the experiment were submitted to Marshfield Labs (Marshfield, WI) and the Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI) to assess levels of protein/albumin/glucose and vitamin A/vitamin E/selenium, respectively. Additionally, the midsection of the jejunum (10 in. long) was collected to isolate IECs by a modified protocol adapted from reference 56. Briefly, the jejunum was cut into small pieces (1 cm) and placed in a 50-ml tube with 20 ml of Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and 2.5 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The tissue was agitated twice in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm for 15 min, and the resulting cell suspension was filtered through a metal cell strainer. The IECs were centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) enriched with 8% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 20 mM HEPES (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 100 g of gentamicin (VetOne, Boise, ID) per ml, and 10 g of ampicillin (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) per ml (E-RPMI). The viability and numbers of IECs were determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. The IECs were stored at \u221280\u00b0C in 500 \u00b5l of RNA later tissue collection buffer (Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) until further analysis.",
