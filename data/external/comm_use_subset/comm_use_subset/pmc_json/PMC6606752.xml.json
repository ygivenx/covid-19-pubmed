            "text": "The last decades have witnessed a broadening of the global diversity of viruses thanks to rapidly evolving random amplification sequencing technology. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized our knowledge by not only uncovering the diversity of viruses at an unprecedented rate, but also by allowing to gain insight into their ecology and distribution, helping to disentangle the network that connects viruses with their hosts and the geographical scenario in which such interactions take place1. However, deciphering the global virome and its structure becomes challenging not just because of the technical difficulties associated with the screening of diverse viruses, but because their many hosts are often understudied, particularly those from remote areas. The Neotropical region is one such example; being among the most biodiverse realms on Earth, Neotropical rainforests are candidates to host and conserve relevant parts of the virosphere diversity2. However, the knowledge of Neotropical viral diversity and their hosts is in its infancy. Given that zoonotic viruses are considered the most probable causative agents of emerging diseases3 and that mammal and avian species are their main hosts4,5, the study of the wildlife viral diversity and their ecological context in these remote areas will provide important information for public and animal health to prevent potential new emerging viral epidemics2,6. For example, the great diversity of the Neotropical fauna harbors the risk of emergence of new infections in domestic animals and humans that might be in contact with these birds or ecosystem because of human impact on nature. Conversely, the valuable biodiversity of these regions may be threatened by invasive viruses imported into the Neotropics7,8. There is growing evidence that the risk of pathogen transfer is increasing in both directions9\u201311, and a comprehensive characterization of the virome of the local fauna may be instrumental in preventing any harmful impact. However, this important knowledge would hardly become available without exploratory approaches, which address the discovery and describe the diversity of viruses that affect non-model host species.",

            "text": "The family Astroviridae comprises two genera, Mamastrovirus, which infect mammals, and Avastrovirus, which infect birds. Astroviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses, with a diameter of 28\u201330 nm. The genome of astroviruses consists of a positive sense linear single-stranded RNA molecule between 6.4 and 7.9 kb with three open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. ORF1a and ORF1b encode two non-structural polyproteins (nsp1a and nsp1ab) which include a protease and a RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). In the overlapping region between ORF1a and ORF1b there is a distinctive frameshifting mechanism consisting of a heptanucleotide and a stem-loop structure18. ORF2 encodes a polyprotein, which is the precursor of viral capsid proteins. This polyprotein is translated from a viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and has two main domains: a highly conserved N terminal and a hypervariable C terminal19. A viral genome-linked protein (VPg) with a key role in genome replication or protein synthesis is also encoded in the genome20,21. This protein is linked to the 5\u2032-end of astrovirus genome and it possesses a TEEEY-like residue that has been demonstrated to be related to viral infectivity in human astroviruses20.",

            "text": "The classification of astroviruses has been redefined several times since they were first discovered in 197513. According to ICTV, the current classification does not correspond to the phylogeny of this group of viruses, being based on the host and the genetic distances (p-dist) among complete amino acid sequences of the capsid region (ORF2). The average genetic distance between groups of Avastroviruses is 0.704, and within the same group it ranges between 0.576 and 0.74113,24. The Astroviridae study group of ICTV also establishes that viruses with p-dist > 75% identity in the complete protein sequence of ORF2 should be considered as members of the same species13. Currently, there are three recognized species of the genus Avastrovirus. Avastrovirus 1 is apparently specific of the Galloanserae, with isolates from turkey (Turkey astrovirus-1; TAstV-1), chicken (Chicken astrovirus; CAstV), duck (Duck astrovirus; DAstV), guineafowl (Guineafowl astrovirus; GFAstV) and goose (Goose astrovirus; GAstV). Avastrovirus 2 includes avian nephritis virus 1 and 2 (ANV-1 and ANV-2), and has been found mainly in chickens, but also in turkeys, ducks and pigeons sporadically. Avastrovirus 3 includes isolates type 2 and 3 from turkey (TAstV-2 and TAstV-3). Therefore, most of the known data on the diversity of Avastrovirus comes from poultry studies, with an evident lack of information from wild species, a circumstance which is usual for most avian diseases26.",

An ORF1b and ORF2 amino acid distance matrix analysis generated with heatmaps confirmed the clear demarcation between passerine avastroviruses and relatives of other Avastrovirus genus (Fig. 1). Genetic distance analysis also indicated that the passerine avastroviruses can be further subgrouped into four supported clades: Passerine astrovirus 1 (PasAstV-1), Passerine astrovirus 2 (PasAstV-2), Passerine astrovirus 3 (PasAstV-3) and Passerine astrovirus 4 (PasAstV-4), since distance values among these four astroviruses double the values found within the other Avastrovirus groups (Table 2). The sequences of the complete genomes of the four PasAstV were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MK096773-76.

Earlier reports on astroviruses from passerines were scarce or absent, with only one representative member detected in a black-napped monarch (Hypothymis azurea) from Cambodia27. However, our findings put forward passerines as putative cornerstone hosts of these viruses in the avifauna of the interior primary forest of the Guianan shield. We documented the presence of astroviruses in 14 species of passerine birds of the families Thamnophilidae, Cardinalidae, Conopophagidae, Furnariidae, Tyraniidae and Turdidae. The avifauna of this region is largely isolated from bird migratory routes, with most species being local residents28,29. In fact, we have never captured Nearctic migrants in various years of fieldwork at the Nouragues reserve. Therefore, further research is needed to clarify whether passerines are important astrovirus hosts worldwide (which have remained undersampled in previous research), or the pattern we found is a local occurrence singularly evolved in a remote and isolated avifauna. In relation to this, it is important to note that we found higher community-level prevalence (4.9%) than the observed in other previous studies based on cloacal swabs (1.7% in a study conducted in Cambodia and Hong Kong17). The difference becomes still higher if it is restricted to passerine birds, for which only one individual tested positive out of 199 screened in Cambodia by Mendenhall et al.27. This represents 0.8% prevalence, comparable with 5.1% of passerines infected in French Guiana (20 positive out of 395 tested).",

The phylogenetic analysis of ORF2 amino acid sequences of Avastrovirus in our study revealed wider phylogenetic diversity than previously thought for the respective genus. Our analysis added two new, early diverging groups to the known diversity of Avastrovirus genus, which before this study was composed of three recognized and accepted avastrovirus species (Avastrovirus 1, 2 and 3)30. According to our phylogenetic analysis, Avastrovirus 1 is a paraphyletic group. Based on phylogenetic evidence, Avastrovirus\n3 should be a member of the same species, although the internal structure of Avastrovirus 1 recommends dividing the whole group into three clades, with Avastrovirus 1b being sister to Avastrovirus 3 and Avastrovirus 1a as a distinct, earliest diverging clade in that group. This topology, where Avastrovirus 1 is not a monophyletic group, can be observed in previous phylogenetic analyses based on full-length ORF2 amino acid sequences31\u201333, although this matter is not addressed in these studies. The four sequences recovered from French Guianan passerines form a distinct novel clade (Avastrovirus 5) that is sister to the group formed by Avastrovirus 1, 2 and 3, although its members are more divergent from one another than the members of other clades. The fact that passerine astroviruses from French Guiana cluster together but form a clade with long internal branches suggests the possibility that greater diversity of viruses exists in this region, hidden by incomplete sampling in our local study of birds from the Guianan shield. The diversity of Avastrovirus can be further broadened by the recognition of Avastrovirus 4, a group of early diverging viruses found in a relatively well-sampled group of birds (ducks). Astroviruses included in Avastrovirus 4 already appeared forming a different clade when they were first described in both RdRp and ORF2 phylogenetic trees17. Our proposal of two new Avastrovirus species is supported by the large between-group mean genetic distances in the amino acid sequences of ORF2 introduced by these viruses, with higher values for Avastrovirus 4 (astroviruses from Northern pintail) and Avastrovirus 5 (astroviruses from French Guianan passerines) than for the previously described species Avastrovirus 1, Avastrovirus 2 and Avastrovirus 3. Leaving aside the taxonomic debate, our results demonstrate that the real diversity of avian astroviruses is yet to be discovered, and sampling in remote areas can be critical to gain full insight into its distribution across regions and hosts.",

The genomes PasAstV-1 and PasAstV-3 have each ORF in a different reading frame, an especial characteristic that only occurs in the DAstV isolate described by Fu et al.34, since astroviruses have usually two ORFs on the same reading frame. PasAstV-4 has ORF1b in +1 frame, the same as ANV-124. Furthermore, ORF1b and ORF2 from PasAstV-2 are on +1 reading frame, which is common in some Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus. PasAstV-1-4 show the conserved tyrosine residue within the TEEEY-like domain in the VPg putative protein. The ORF sizes of astroviruses from French Guiana are more similar to those from Mamastrovirus than from Avastrovirus. The 5\u2032 ends of the four passerine astroviruses are within Astroviridae range (11\u201385 nt)35, although they are longer than those described for other Avastrovirus. As in the European roller astrovirus isolate, phylogenetically related to Mamastrovirus, passerine astroviruses lack the gRNA promoter sequence on their 5\u2032 end36. It is also interesting the Mamastrovirus-like structure present on the ribosomal frame-shift signal located between the ORF1a and 1b of PasAstV-1. Stop-codon location between AAAAAAC heptamer and the stem-loop in the ORF1a suggests that the ancestor of this astrovirus likely originated from a recombination event between Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, even though recombinations between the two genera have not been described so far13. Likewise, only one case of recombination in a human astrovirus between ORF1a and ORF1b has been described37. These Mamastrovirus-like features in avian astroviruses together with the wide genetic variety of Astroviridae have been proposed as a sign of possible cross-species transmission36.",

            "text": "The four astroviruses discovered in passerines of French Guiana, provisionally named as Avastrovirus 5, imply an increase in the diversity of Astroviridae, because although they have a typical Avastrovirus genomic structure, they also share some characteristics of the members of Mamastrovirus. Interestingly, only representatives of Avastrovirus 5 have been found in birds from French Guiana (including a wide representation of avian lineages). One explanation for this could be that previously known diversity of astroviruses is mainly restricted to particular hosts (such as chickens, ducks or turkeys) which were not present in our study. Alternatively, French Guianan astroviruses likely represent an endemic diversity, which would persist in this remote and greatly isolated area as no migratory avian species or other major sources of interchange such as poultry trading occurs. Sampling typical hosts of Astrovirus 1, 2 and 3 in French Guiana would help answer this question. Astroviruses are present in the virome of some animals19,38, but there are no reports about astroviruses as a causative agent of disease in wild birds, so they could be only the hosts of these viruses. Therefore, our results pave the road for further research about the evolutionary origin, geographic distribution and ecological relationships of these viruses, an interest that can be extended to other virus families.",

The VTM were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min to pellet out epithelial cells. VTM were removed and the pellets resuspended in 250 \u00b5l of PBS. Then, samples were subjected to 2 freeze-thaw cycles at \u221280 \u00b0C to maximize the release of viral particles, and filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m pore-sized column filters at 8,000 rpm for 5 min to enrich viral particles in the flow-through. We took 50 \u00b5l of the filtrate of each sample and mixed them in five pools of 10 samples each.

Finally, viral RNA/DNA was extracted with the MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Standard biosafety level-2 biocontainment measures were followed during the whole process. The extracted viral RNA and DNA were subjected after random RT-PCR amplification for library preparation by using QIAseq FX DNA Library Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Normalized samples were pooled and sequenced using 600-cycle (2 \u00d7 300 bp paired-end) MiSeq Reagent Kits v3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) on a MiSeq platform. The generated raw reads were first qualitatively checked, with Phred quality score < 20 trimmed and filtered to remove polyclonal and low quality reads (< 55 bases long) using CLC workbench (Qiagen). The remaining filtered raw reads were de-novo assembled separately using Trinity v2.6.64239 and CLC workbench and compared with a non-redundant and viral proteome database (NCBI) using BLASTx with an E-value cut-off 0.001. The virus-like contigs and singlets were further compared to all protein sequences in non-redundant protein databases with a default E-value cutoff of 0.001.

Recombinations were considered only when they were detected by more than three out of seven methods having significant p-values (p < 0.05). The phylogenetic tree based on ORF2 amino acid sequences was inferred using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach available in BEAST v1.8431. The analysis was performed under the best fit amino acid substitution model identified as LG + \u0413 + I + F using Bayesian Information Criterion implemented as the model selection framework in jModelTest48 and MEGA X49. Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) were run for 107 generations, sampling every 1,000 trees. Traces were inspected for convergence with Tracer 1.550. The 10,000 resulting trees were summarized with TreeAnnotator v2.1.250 and the phylogeny with branch posterior probabilities was displayed in FigTree v1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). We also computed pairwise amino acid genetic distances (p-dist) of the capsid region (ORF2) between isolates, between astrovirus groups and between members of the same group. To do so, we used MEGA X program using the bootstrap method with 1000 replicates and partial deletion (95%).
