            "text": "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious disease characterized by acute liver damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Alonso et al., 1998; Jung et al., 2000). The first outbreak of RHD was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China (Zhu et al., 2016) and has quickly spread to most parts of the world (Calvete et al., 2018; Dalton et al., 2018). This has led to the deaths of millions of rabbits and hares, representing a serious threat to their populations. The etiologic agent that causes RHD is rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) (Abrantes et al., 2012), a calicivirus of the Lagovirus genus. RHDV contains both genomic RNA (gRNA) and additional subgenomic RNA sequences (sgRNA). The genomic RNA consists of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule that is 7437 nucleotides in length and includes two slightly overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that is cleaved into mature non-structural proteins 1\u20136 (NSP1\u20136) and the major structural protein (VP60) (Meyers et al., 1991, 2000). Of the non-structural proteins, NSP6 is known to be a trypsin-like cysteine protease (Allaire et al., 1994; Boniotti et al., 1994; Wirblich et al., 1995) that is released from larger precursors molecules via proteolytic cleavage at the N and C termini. Mutagenesis analysis has suggested that three amino acids in particular (His27, Asp44, and Cys104) play an important role in NSP6 function as a catalytic triad (Wirblich et al., 1995).",

            "text": "Although the first outbreak of RHD was more than 30 years ago, the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are still not fully understood. The liver is believed to be the main site of RHDV reproduction, with viral replication leading to liver cell apoptosis and necrosis (Jung et al., 2000). It is also known that systemic hemorrhagic diathesis and DIC can lead to rabbit death. These are most likely consequences of liver cell loss through RHDV-induced apoptosis (Alonso et al., 1998; Trzeciak-Ryczek et al., 2015). Hepatocytes are indeed the first choice cells in this study, but so far there is no stable rabbit liver cell line, which brings some difficulties to the research. Studies have shown that RHDV infection can not only cause liver cell apoptosis, but also cause the apoptosis of multiple cells in various organs such as heart, spleen, lung, kidney, etc., (Alonso et al., 1998). Therefore, a stable kidney cell line from rabbit (RK13 cell) was selected as the object to study cell apoptosis in this research. Studies have also shown that macrophages and endothelial cells also display the morphological hallmarks of apoptosis (Gelmetti et al., 1998). Further research has found that granulocyte and lymphocyte apoptosis also occurs in rabbits infected with various RHDV strains (Marques et al., 2010; Niedzwiedzka-Rystwej and Deptula, 2012; Teixeira et al., 2012; Niedzwiedzka-Rystwej et al., 2013). More recently, studies have indicated that N-acetyl cysteine (San-Miguel et al., 2006), cardiotrophin (Tunon et al., 2011b), and melatonin (Tunon et al., 2011a), can attenuate liver damage and prolong survival in RHDV-infected rabbits. This is likely due to the induction of various anti-apoptotic factors and their inherent anti-apoptotic effects. Altogether, these findings suggest that apoptosis plays an important role in RHD-mediated symptoms and may be a key determinant of disease pathogenesis. However, the exact viral components that contribute to the apoptosis-inducing effects of RHDV are unknown, and research is hampered by the fact that RHDV cannot be propagated in cell culture.",

We first amplified NSP6 from the full-length cDNA clone of RHDV strain NJ-2009 through PCR and cloned the product into a pcDNA3.1-6 His vector for expression and subsequent analysis. This showed that NSP6 expression could induce apoptosis in RK13, HeLa, and HepG2 cells, likely via modification of caspase expression and altered Bax and Bcl2 expression ratios. This effect was ameliorated by mutation of the catalytic His27 residue of NSP6, suggesting involvement of this residue in NSP6 apoptosis induction. Altogether, our findings indicate that NSP6 contributes to RHDV-induced apoptosis of host cells and is therefore central to RHDV pathogenesis in rabbits.",

As showed in Figure 2C, 24 h after transfection with pcDNA3.1-NSP6, the percentage of apoptotic cells was markedly increased to 75% (including 30% early apoptotic rate and 45% late apoptotic rate). This result presented a difference comparing dates presented in Figures 2A,B. The main reason for this difference is that the results from both MTT and trypan blue dye exclusion test reflect the level of living cells, but cells under way in apoptosis may still counted as living cells in those method. However, in annexin V/PI assay, early apoptotic cells and late apoptotic cells were detected. In agreement with these observations, a TUNEL analysis further confirmed the presence of an apoptotic cell population in pcDNA3.1-NSP6 transfected RK13 cells. As shown in Figure 2D, compared to vector control, TUNEL-positive cells (green) were observed in pcDNA3.1-NSP6-transfected RK13 cells. However, only adherent cells were detected in TUNEL assay as a large number of apoptotic cells in the supernatant were discarded with the culture medium during the experiment. Therefore, the apoptotic rate indicated by TUNEL assays was only 4%. In addition, we found that percentage of apoptotic RK13 cells induced by NSP6 was increased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). Moreover, similar results were also obtained in human HeLa and HepG2 cells (Figures 3B,C), indicating that the effect was not limited to RK13 cells and that NSP6-induced apoptosis is not cell specific.",

We found that caspase-3 activity was first observed in NSP6-transfected cells at 12 hpt and upregulated 1.6-fold at 48 hpt (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the activities of caspase-8 and caspase-9, which are representative initiator to caspases in the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, respectively, were also measured. As shown in Figures 4B,C the caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities were also increased in NSP6-transfected cells and maximal increases were observed at 48 hpt (1.6-fold and 1.7-fold increases in activity, respectively, when compared with that of the pcDNA3.1-6 His vector control).

Like many other positive-strand RNA viruses, RHDV-infection can also induce cell apoptosis in vivo and is believed to contribute to RHD pathogenesis (Alonso et al., 1998). Previously, RHDV research was limited due to the lack of a stable cell system to culture the virus in vitro. So far, it has remained unclear which viral components contribute to RHDV-induced apoptosis. RHDV NSP6 is a 3C-like protease. Functionally, RHDV NSP6 is similar to the 3C proteases of picornaviruses (Wirblich et al., 1995), although much more is known of the picornavirus genome. These proteases show serine protease activity and are structurally homologous to cellular serine proteases of the trypsin family. The cleavage reactions they mediate are required for releasing the different functional viral polyproteins. In addition to this protease activity, it has been reported that picornavirus 3C proteases, including those from coxsackievirus B3, enterovirus 71, and poliovirus, can also induce apoptosis (Barco et al., 2000; Li et al., 2002; Calandria et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2006; Zaragoza et al., 2006; Chau et al., 2007). The role of 3C-like protease induced apoptosis has also been characterized in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (Lin et al., 2006).

His-NSP6 fusion protein was found primarily aggregated in the cytoplasm of RK13 cells detected by immunofluorescence assay (Figure 1). This is slightly different with the results from Urakova et al. (2015). Urakova team perform research about subcellular localization of recombinant non-structural RHDV proteins. Their study pointed out the NSP6 (RHDV protease) was found to accumulate in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments at 24 h after transfection (Urakova et al., 2015). We speculated that one reason for this discrepancy may be due to the different time points we choosed. In our experiment, we found that very few NSP6+ positive cells was detected and a large number of cells occured apoptosis and shed into the culture medium without detection at 24 hpt by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Therefore, we changed the detection time and detected the expression of NSP6 protein in RK13 cells at 12 hpt. Another reason is the limitations of our method. We did not analyze the fluorescence signal in the nucleus at 12 hpt. Trypan blue test showed that a decrease in cell viability observed in pcDNA3.1-NSP6 transfected RK13 cells which was further confirmed by MTT assay. Both of the tests showed that NSP6 protein is cytotoxic to the cells, and the cytotoxicity was time dependent (Figures 2A,B). To confirm the decrease in cell viability was due to the induction of apoptosis, the quantification of cellular apoptosis was performed by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. We found a marked increase in TUNEL positive cells in pcDNA3.1-NSP6 transfected RK13 cells (Figure 2D) and the increased number of annexin V+ cells (lower right quadrant, Figure 2C) and AnnexinV+/PI+ cells (upper right quadrant, Figure 2C) confirmed induction of apoptosis by pcDNA3.1-NSP6 in RK13 cells. In addition, NSP6 induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in RK13 cells (Figure 3A). This was replicated in human HeLa and HepG2 cells (Figures 3B,C), indicating that the effect is not limited to RK13 cells. Based on the above results, we speculated and NSP6 is highly likely to be responsible for the apoptosis observed during RHDV infection.",

            "text": "Caspase-3 is a major effector caspase in both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways acting on enzymes that are indispensable for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (Duprez et al., 2009; Lan et al., 2013). A previous studies has shown a marked increase in caspase-3 activity at 36 h (12.5-fold) and 48 h post-inoculation (12.6-fold) in RHDV-infected animals, indicating apoptosis activation (Garcia-Lastra et al., 2010). Consistent with these results, our current study found that caspase-3 activity were activated in NSP6-transfected cells, indicating that NSP6 induces RK13 cells apoptosis through activation of the effector caspase, caspase-3. Furthermore, we found that the caspase-8 (representative initiator caspase in the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway) and caspase-9 (representative initiator caspase in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway) activities were also increased in NSP6-transfected cells. These results suggest that RHDV NSP6 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in RK13 cells via both the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. However, the activation of the initiator caspase-8 can also be related to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via cleavage of Bid (a member of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family) and translocation of the truncated Bid to mitochondria (Wang et al., 1996; Lan et al., 2013). Therefore, to clarify the detailed mechanisms of NSP6-induced apoptosis, further investigations that focus on the kinetics of signal transduction factors are necessary. Conversely, Bcl2, an anti-apoptotic protein that promotes cell survival (Polcic et al., 2017), acts to regulate the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways through broad molecular interactions with other critical cellular proteins. Meanwhile, Bax, a protein that also features a Bcl-2 like conserved domain, plays a vital role in promoting programmed cell death. The balance in Bax and Bcl2 expression can affect mitochondrial cytochrome c release, promoting apoptosis during increased Bax to Bcl2 ratios (Pepper et al., 1997; Li et al., 2017). A study also suggested that apoptosis induced by RHDV-infection is related to the modulation of Bcl2 and Bax genes (San-Miguel et al., 2006). This is in agreement with our results where the relative expression levels of Bcl2 and Bax mRNA changed significantly in NSP6 expressing cells. More importantly, we found that the ratios of Bax to Bcl2 were higher in NSP6 expressing cells, further promoting apoptosis.",

Asn and Gly were chosen as residue substitutions, as they do not have similar structural functions to the wild-type residues, cannot form disulfide bridges, and are different in size and chemistry and could thus damage proteolytic activity (Boniotti et al., 1994). So three single-point mutants were constructed and the apoptosis induction of each mutant were confirmed by flow cytometry. Our data showed that mutation of the 3C-like protease active site (specifically the His27 residue) impaired NSP6-induced apoptosis indicate that the mechanism of RHDV NSP6 promoted apoptosis is similar to the 3C proteases of picornaviruses. Moreover, our result is consistent with previous research showing that mutating sites involved in protease activity impairs apoptosis induced by an enterovirus 71 3C protease in human neural cells (Li et al., 2002).",
