Killip's Rating Standards were used by six trials with patients of myocardial infarction-induced HF, while other trials used NYHA Classification. Most of trails used three categories to evaluate treatment effect including markedly effective (an improvement of two classes on the classification), effective (an improvement of one class), and ineffective (no improvement, deterioration or death), and others only reported total effect. Total effect rate is the combination of markedly effect rate and effect rate. Trials of myocardial infarction-induced HF and nonmyocardial infarction-induced HF were separated into two subgroups. The meta-analysis showed a total significant difference between SFI and control groups on total effect rate (RR: 1.19, 95% CI [1.17, 1.21]; P < 0.01). And significant difference appeared in both subgroups separately, with RR ratio 1.19 in subgroup of myocardial infarction-induced HF (95% CI [1.16, 1.21]; P < 0.01), and 1.46 in the other subgroup (95% CI [1.25, 1.70]; P < 0.01) (Figure 4).\n",

It is usually used for the assessment of HF and drug efficacy. Sixty-one studies reported the outcomes for LVEF. Meta-analysis showed that SFI group was better than control group in increasing LVEF (WMD: 6.31; 95% CI [5.18, 7.44], P < 0.01) (Supplementary Figure  4). SV is the volume per stroke by left ventricle, and CO is the volume of blood being pumped by the heart in the time interval of one minute [107]. CI is a vasodynamic parameter that is relating CO to body surface area [107]. All the three parameters indicate left ventricular systolic function, as LVEF does. This paper made meta-analysis of these outcomes, respectively; results showed that SFI group was better than control group in these three parameters: SV (WMD: 7.25; 95% CI [4.60, 9.90], P < 0.01); CO (WMD: 0.67; 95% CI [0.47, 0.87], P < 0.01); CI (WMD: 0.36; 95% CI [0.23, 0.48], P < 0.01) (Supplementary Figures  5\u20137). E/A ratio is widely accepted as a clinical marker of diastolic HF, and E/A ratio is reduced in diastolic dysfunction [108]. The result of meta-analysis of E/A ratio was WMD: 0.15; 95% CI [0.08, 0.22], P < 0.01, which indicated that SFI better improved diastolic function of heart on HF patients than conventional medicine treatment did (Supplementary Figure  8). LVDd is the end-diastolic dimension of the left ventricle. There was no statistical significance between SFI combined with conventional medicine treatment and conventional medicine treatment groups (WMD: \u22121.59; 95% CI [\u22125.29, 2.12], P = 0.40) (Supplementary Figure  9). \n",

However, it has been increasingly recognized that western medicine may sometimes fail to treat an illness, whereas such illness is reportedly improved by the so-called complementary medicine based on a different theory [110, 111]. Although conventional therapeutic approaches were used in HF, it remained a cardiovascular disease with an increasing hospitalization burden and an ongoing drain on health care expenditures [2]. TCM plays an important role in treating HF in China. SFI was a traditional Chinese Patent Medicine based on TCM theory, which was approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. In recent 10 years, it has been widely used for HF in many hospitals and clinics. However, few RCTs of SFI were reported in English journals, and it was difficult for western doctors to accept SFI as an alternative medicine. Although there were two systematic reviews about SFI for HR published in Chinese journal [112, 113], only 16 and 8 trials were included in their study. Therefore, the present study aimed to systematically assess the efficacy and safety of SFI for HR. ",

Another outcome was adverse events, to which more attention should be attached. Only 37.4% of the trials described the occurrence of adverse events, indicating an incomplete evaluation of the safety profile of SFI, as well as poor quality of reporting. In most trials, the duration of therapy and followup was too short to achieve conclusive results, except that only one trial had a treatment of 10 months [47]. Only 6 included trials had a followup period (ranged from 3 to 12 months), while in rest of studies, the outcomes were evaluated at the end of the treatment (mostly range from 14 to 21 days). In order to evaluate drug efficacy for chronic HF, long-term improvement (at least 6 months) of chronic HF-specific clinical symptoms is needed [114], because some drugs have shown to increase mortality in the long-term application despite a short-term improvement in clinical symptoms [115].
