DENV infection causes dengue fever, the more dangerous dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, all of which are very contagious [3]. According to a World Health Organization report, there are 50 million DENV infections and 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever annually, the latter requiring hospitalization [4]. In 2014, there was an outbreak of dengue fever in China and countries within Southeast Asia, with more than 50,000 DENV-infected people in southern China. DENV infections are not only a threat to human health, but also cause huge economic losses to society.",

Because of antibody-dependent enhancement [6], upon reinfection with a different DENV serotype, antibodies against the virus are able to form a type of immune complex that activates the complement system resulting in immunopathologies [7], such as the pathogenesis of dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. Without an effective vaccine to prevent DENV infection, multiple and sequential infections with DENV1-4 are to be expected for people living in regions where dengue is hyperendemic [6, 8].Therefore, rapid detection and differentiation of DENV serotypes are crucial for effective clinical diagnosis as well as for epidemiological investigation of this pathogen.",

For microbiological diagnosis of DENV, several techniques have been developed; these include virus isolation, immunoassays, and biochemical tests using nucleotide probes [9\u201311]. Virus isolation is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for DENV detection. However, it is laborious and time consuming when used for routine clinical examination of patients. The presence of cross-reactive antigens shared by flaviviruses makes specific diagnosis of DENV by immunoassay not possible in most cases. Furthermore, because the antibodies produced in response to the virus do not occur at an early stage of the infection, the immunoassay methods are not suitable for early diagnosis. Nucleic acid detection is deemed to be a timely and effective method for diagnosis of DENV infection. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and real-time PCR methods have both been used widely for laboratory diagnosis because of their high sensitivities and specificities [12, 13]. However, they require specialized equipment, which restricts the popularization of this approach [14\u201316]. Hence, there is great demand for a rapid, simple, convenient, and appropriate method for use in resource-poor health clinics.",

This method is a promising tool to meet the increasing need for a fast and easily performable pathogen detection assay [18]. LAMP can be used to determine the sex of animals [19], and establish if a food has been genetically modified [20]. Reverse transcriptase LAMP (RT-LAMP), which is based on amplification of reverse-transcribed cDNA, has the same sensitivity of DNA amplification by the standard LAMP method [21]. This method has been adopted for detecting various viruses [22\u201325], especially for detecting viruses that cause similar symptoms in a host and share a high degree of nucleotide homology among them [15, 26, 27]. Disappointingly, because of its high sensitivity, RT-LAMP is easily affected by aerosol pollution thereby resulting in false-positive samples. The need to prevent aerosol generation is of paramount importance when using RT-LAMP.",

However, use of the same gene is not the best choice for all DENV1-4 genotypes because there may be high sequence identity among genotypes with the same serotype but low sequence variability among the four serotypes; this situation is relevant for the C-prM gene, its 3\u2032-UTR [32], and NS1 [31]. The detection limits for DENV1-4 differ and the diagnostic accuracy was < 90 % because the DENV1-4 primers were limited to the same gene in earlier reports.

The standard curves were generated by linear regression analysis of TTP for RT-LAMP and the Ct of real-time PCR for each amplification reaction versus the log10 RNA copy number (Fig. 12a). Additionally, the time taken for fluorescence signal detection for each RT-LAMP and real-time PCR amplification was calculated according to TTP or Ct, respectively, after which the standard curves were generated by linear regression analysis (Fig. 12b).

There is an urgent need for fast and accurate clinical diagnosis and serotype differentiation of DENV1-4 to prevent and treat this viral infection. Conventional methods of DENV detection, which include virus isolation, immunoassay, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR [10], have many drawbacks in that they are time consuming to perform, require special equipment, and have a high propensity for cross-reaction of the DENV1-4 serotypes. In contrast, RT-LAMP can be performed using a water bath or a heating block under isothermal conditions [17], and is more sensitive and faster to perform than the other methods described herein. Some studies have reported the use of RT-LAMP for analyzing DENV. However, the detection limits for the DENV1-4 serotypes differed from each other and the diagnostic accuracy was < 90 % because the DENV1-4 primers were restricted to the same gene in the earlier reports [29\u201331, 35], although they could detect and differentiate DENV1-4 isotypes. In our study, we did not restrict the design of the primers to the same gene, but allowed different genes to be included in the search for optimal sequences with which to differentiate the different viral serotypes using multiple sequence alignments. This approach allowed us to establish an RT-LAMP method for detection of DENV 1\u20134 with higher sensitivity and greater diagnostic potential than RT-PCR and real-time PCR. The RT-LAMP reaction was sensitive enough to detect 10-copies of RNA template unlike RT-PCR and real-time PCR that each had detection limits of 100 copies. Scientific literature searches show that several studies have reported a higher sensitivity for real-time PCR than RT-PCR, but the detection limits of RT-PCR and real-time PCR can be discrepant in different detection systems, although both methods could detect 100 copies of DENV [36\u201339], which is consistent with our results.",

To avoid contamination, the tubes used for RT-LAMP reactions should not be opened; however, it is not feasible to add the SYBR Green I to the tube directly before the start of the LAMP reaction because a high concentration of SYBR Green I can inhibit this reaction [40]. Therefore, in our study, to avoid aerosol pollution, the SYBR Green I was dispensed directly onto the inner cover of the reaction tube. After the reaction was completed, the SYBR Green I was mixed with the RT-LAMP reaction mix by centrifugation. Furthermore, a new fluorescence-real time-monitoring instrument, ESE (DEAOU, Guangzhou, China) was used to eliminate aerosol pollution; this enabled the real-time monitoring of the RT-LAMP amplification to be realized using matched software.
