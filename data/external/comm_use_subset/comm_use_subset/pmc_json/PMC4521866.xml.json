It protrudes out of the viral envelope as homotrimers composed of non-covalently-linked gp120/gp41 heterodimers [2\u20134]. Recognition of the viral receptor and co-receptor by the surface gp120 subunit activates the fusion machinery in the transmembrane (TM) gp41 subunit (Fig 1) [5\u20138], resulting in the insertion of gp41 N-terminal fusion peptide region (FP) into the target cell membrane. This pre-fusion intermediate conformation of gp41 connects the cellular membrane and the viral envelope, exposing and extending the two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2 [9\u201311]. The intermediate conformation quickly resolves into a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) conformation, after HR2 folds back onto the central HR1 to form a coiled-coil trimer-of-dimers [12, 13]. This predisposes the opposing membranes into sufficient proximity for subsequent envelope fusion with the plasma membrane and viral content delivery [14].",

Sequential alignments have revealed a high conservation of MPER among different groups of HIV-1 (Fig 1) [15]. In particular, it contains two conserved sequence elements that contribute to its membrane perturbation function. One is an enrichment of aromatic amino acids, in particular Trp (Fig 1), and the other is its cholesterol-interacting C-terminus.",

In the context of gp41, the Trp\u2192Ala substitutions in MPER inhibit membrane fusion events, such as the fusion pore expansion, during viral entry. [17]. Furthermore, the MPER C-terminus (LWYIK) shows sequence characteristics of the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif,-L/V-(X)(1\u20135)-Y-(X)(1\u20135)-R/K- [20, 21]. Cholesterol is enriched in viral envelopes and also in the cell membrane lipid rafts where viral receptors are enriched during viral entry, making the membranes rigid and counteracting viral entry [22, 23]. The C terminus of MPER can facilitate the induction of membrane destabilization and subsequent fusion in the cholesterol-enriched liposomal membranes [24\u201326].",

T20 and T1249, two of the first fusion inhibitors, are synthetic peptides containing sequences from both the HR2 and the N-terminus of MPER (Fig 1) [27, 28]. HR2 sequences enable these inhibitors to bind to the exposed HR1 of gp41 in the pre-fusion intermediate conformation, and thereby halt the formation of the 6-HB [9]. In addition, MPER sequences act as inhibitors at a later stage of the viral entry, possibly through anchoring the peptide into the cellular membrane through their last four residues, WNWF [29\u201331]. The membrane anchoring abilities of the two fusion inhibitors correlate with their antiviral activity [32]. Still, peptide fusion inhibitors, such as T20 and T1249, only included partial MPER sequences without the C-terminal sequence [33]. Due to the high variation and mutation rate of HIV-1 Env protein, the fusion inhibitors were constantly challenged by drug resistance issues. The MPER is a conserved, exposed and accessible region, and therefore it could be an additional target for the design of potential fusion inhibitors.",

            "text": "Apart from its role in viral entry, Env also interacts with host cellular membranes during its biosynthesis and trafficking to the viral budding site. As a type I transmembrane protein, Env is co-translationally translocated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and further transported to the Golgi complex for maturation into gp160 and subsequent proteolytic processing [34, 35]. The resulting gp120/gp41 trimers are then transported to the cholesterol-rich plasma membrane regions (e.g. lipid rafts), following the secretory pathway [36]. Studying SARS-CoV (severe respiratory syndrome associated corona virus) we observed that the Trp residues in MPER modulate the selective incorporation of the spike protein into lipid rafts (unpublished observations, See S1 and S2 Figs). However, Salzwedel and colleagues found that neither deletion nor Trp substitution mutations in the HIV-1 MPER affected Env maturation, or steady-state levels, but had an effect on its incorporation into virus particles [17].",

Six peptides ranging from 19 to 37 amino acids (a.a.) were designed to contain the MPER sequence in its full length, with C-terminal truncation, or with penta Trp\u2192Ala substitution (Fig 1). Their anti-viral activities were tested in a single-round infectivity assay using pseudovirus. Dimerization of anti-viral peptides has been shown to enhance both their structural stability and the number of interaction sites and thus their anti-viral efficacy [37\u201340]. Therefore, we also tested our peptides as N- or C-terminal dimers. HIV-1 Env with mutations of Trp residues at the MPER region were also constructed to examine the roles of the Trp residues in the biosynthesis, maturation, trafficking, and viral incorporation of the viral structural proteins.",

To ensure study the early events of the HIV-1 viral replication cycle a HIV-1 pseudovirus system allowing only a single replication cycle was employed. Pseudovirus particles were produced by the co-transfection of the Env- and Vpu-expression-deficient proviral vector pNLHIV\u0394u\u0394ss and the Env-, Vpu- and Nef- expressing vector pNL1.5EU+ [48], which generates viral particles capable of entering and infecting target cells but not capable of giving rise to infectious second-generation viral particles. The pseudotyped HIV-1 (NL4-3) particles were pre-incubated with each of the six MPER-containing peptides for 1 h and then added to the target cells, TZM-bl cells, which stably express a tat-responsive luciferase reporter gene allowing for the monitoring of successful HIV-1 entry and viral protein production. The inhibition of infection was monitored by measuring the luciferase expression at 72 h post-infection. Peptide LK21, which contained the entire and exclusively the MPER sequence, inhibited 50% and 80% of viral entry and infection at 8.0 \u03bcM and 12.3 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig 2A). Inclusion of five HR2 residues to LK21 N-terminus, generating the 26-a.a. peptide QK26, decreased the IC50 and IC80 values to 3.9 \u03bcM and 8.8 \u03bcM, respectively. However, further N-terminal extension with the addition of nine and sixteen HR2 residues to LK21, resulting in peptides EK30 and EK37, did not lead to any substantial increase in their anti-viral potency. However, adding the HR2 hydrophilic residues greatly enhanced the solubility and structural stability of the MPER-containing peptides QK26, EK30 and EK37, allowing further application and design, such as peptide dimerization that will be elaborated on in section 2.",

This deletion abrogated the antiviral activity, as QT19 failed to inhibit viral infection at concentration up to 33.3\u03bcM (Fig 2A). In addition, the importance of the enriched aromatic residue Trp in the MPER region was examined by mutating all the Trp to Ala in the exclusively MPER-containing peptide, LK21, resulting in the peptide LK21-5W5A. Interestingly, the substitutions of all the Trp did not just abolish the antiviral activity of the peptide, but even enhanced viral infectivity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2A). At 26.6 \u03bcM, the LK21-5W5A increased the viral infectivity by 50%. The inhibitions of viral infectivity by the MPER-derived peptides were not due to cytotoxicity, as incubating TZM-bl cells with 50 \u03bcM of the peptides for 24 h did not result in any statistical difference in cell viability between the control (DMSO-treated) and the peptide-treated cells (Fig 2B).",

The HR2 region of another class I viral fusion glycoprotein, the spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has previously been shown to be largely \u03b1-helical and a synthetic peptide (HR2-S) derived from this region served as a control peptide in the following CD study [56]. The peptides were prepared in 10% TFE that mimics the lipidic environment at the juxtamembrane junction. The N-terminal extension of LK21 with HR2-derived residues generally increased the helicity in the MPER-containing peptides. Deleting the C-terminal sequence, NWLWYIK, from QK26 did not change the secondary structure drastically (Fig 2C). To mimic the increasingly lipidic environment transition, which the MPER undergoes during membrane fusion, the TFE concentration was increased from 10%, 20% and to 40%. With increasing TFE concentrations, LK21 gradually exhibited a more alpha-helical conformation, with the first minimum of its spectra shifted from 212 nm to 209 nm, and then to 208 nm, and the estimated \u03b1-helical content increased from 41% to 52% and then to 71% (Fig 2D). In contrast, LK21-5W5A, the peptide with all the Trp replaced by Ala, exhibited canonical alpha-helical spectra and a high \u03b1-helical content (84%) starting from 20% TFE (Fig 2E), which indicates the importance of Trp residues in maintaining the structural plasticity of the MPER sequence.",

The N-terminal dimerization of EK37 and EK30 enhanced their anti-viral potencies (Fig 4B and 4C).

In contrast, the C-terminal dimerization decreased the potency of EK37 and QK26, with IC50 values of EK37-DC and QK26-DC elevated by 1.7 and 1.3 fold, respectively (Fig 4D). Meanwhile, the C-terminal dimerization had inconsistent effect on the antiviral potency of the EK30-DC, its IC50 value decreased and IC80 value significantly increased with respect to its monomeric form (Fig 4D). In summary these data indicate that the anti-viral activity is benefited by N-terminal dimerization of MPER-containing peptides. No cytotoxicity effect of the monomeric nor dimeric peptides was observed in vitro in TZM-bl cells at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM, as determined by the PrestoBlue cell viability assay (Fig 4E).",

The analysis was performed using the automated system ARCHIECT (Abbot) accreditated for detection of p24 in human serum. We also performed in-house validation experiments with HIV-1 infected cells in the presence of the protease inhibitor Indinavir to confirm that the system did not detect the p24 within p55/Gag but only the mature p24 once processed from its precursor protein. The corresponding cell lysates were therefore subjected to analysis by Western blot and the findings clearly confirmed the elevated intracellular levels of p24 in the HIV(W3A) as compared to the HIV(WT) (Fig 5B). Two other viral proteins, Vif and Nef were blotted and served as control for the transfection efficiency to which p55/Gag and p24 expression was standardized. The results further indicated that the intracellular elevation of p24 by 93% (p = 0.01, n = 5) was a result of increased expression of p55/Gag, as the p55/Gag levels were 330% in the HIV(W3A) mutant as compared to that in the HIV(WT) (p = 0.007, n = 5) (Fig 5B and 5C).",

As compared to that in HIV(WT), there was moderate decrease in Env level among the mutant viral particles. In contrast, p55/Gag and p24 contents in isolated HIV(W3A) virus particle were elevated by approximately 200% and 310%, respectively (Fig 5E and 5F), which is in line with elevated p24 levels detected in both the cell culture lysates and supernatants by the automated system, ARCHITECT. It further indicates an increased HIV(W3A) viral particle production as a result of increased intracellular p55/Gag expression.

N-terminal extension of LK21 with five amphipathic residues derived from HR1-biding region of HR2 (628 a.a.\u2013666 a.a.) enhanced the anti-viral effect and reduced the IC50 by half. Further N-terminal extension of LK21 did not enhance its anti-viral effect substantially, probably because this sequence does not include enough residues to mediate a stable interaction between the peptide and the viral HR1 as 6-HB formation. Instead, the enhancement of the anti-viral efficacy through addition of five amphipathic residues correlated with the subtle increase in the helicity of the resulting peptides while maintaining the general structural profiles, as estimated from the respective circular dichroism spectrum. In the context of gp41, this amphipathic sequence upstream to the MPER serves as an extension into HR2 and induces the N-terminus of MPER in fusogenic gp41 to transform from an extended conformation to a helix upon increases in local lipidity [60]. This suggests that the addition of five residues of the N-terminal amphipathic sequence confers the peptides a more stable conformation and a capacity to interact with HR1, which lead to their enhanced anti-viral efficacy.",

Meanwhile, the MPER C-termini of the neighboring gp41 stay monomeric and assume an extended platform to destabilize the cholesterol-enriched lipid bilayers, likely through its CRAC motif (LWYIK) [24\u201326]. Our data show that deletion of the C-terminal sequence including the conserved CRAC motif in the MPER-containing peptide QK26 abrogated its anti-viral effect, suggesting that this membrane-active sequence plays an essential role in the anti-viral mechanism of the peptide. The peptide dimerization data further support that the inclusion of free C-termini for membrane interaction in the MPER peptides are important for their inhibition of HIV-1 entry, as constraining the peptide C-termini through C-terminal resulted in the anti-viral effects of peptide EK37 and QK26 unenhanced. A previous study by Nomura et.al also observed that the C-terminal trimerization of T20 failed to enhance its anti-viral efficacy significantly, presumably because the trimerization constrains its membrane-active MPER sequence, offsetting the activity enhancement due to the potential cooperative interaction between its HR2 sequences and the viral gp41 HR1 [38, 62]. The enrichment of Trp residues in MPER is a second important membrane-active characteristic exhibited by class I fusion glycoproteins [63]. Trp contains a large indole-ring side-chain that is preferred by the juxtamembrane interface of proteins, facilitating protein-membrane interaction and stabilizing protein structure [64\u201366]. In this study, we examined the influence of Trp residues in the design of fusion inhibitors by substituting the indole-ring side-chains of the five Trp residues in LK21 with the alkyl moieties of Ala. Surprisingly, the resulted LK21-W5A peptide promoted viral infectivity rather than inhibiting it, a phenotype that has been also observed when Ala-substituting the Trp residues of the SARS-CoV MPER peptide [67]. The data indicate the significance of membrane-active elements in MPER-containing peptides, both the CRAC motif and Trp residues, for the inhibition of HIV-1 entry. This is in agreement with previous findings that increased membrane reactivity owing to inclusion of the MPER N-terminal sequence (LDKWASLWNWF) as in T20 and T1249, correlated with an enhanced anti-viral effect of the peptides [29\u201332]. Of note, our data further demonstrate the involvement of the C-terminal CRAC motif (LWYIK) in facilitating viral inhibition for short MPER-containing peptides with minimal inclusion of HR2 sequences.",

            "text": "Aside from its involvement in membrane fusion events, Trp residues have also been shown to modulate the interaction between MPER and other viral domain(s) during viral entry. Specifically, gp41 MPER interacts with FP to form a continuous hydrophobic track along with the 6-HB and promote membrane juxta-positioning [68, 69]. Shortly before the interaction stabilizes and during the transition from the pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation, the MPER and/or FP could be temporarily exposed and vulnerable to dominant-negative binding by peptidyl fusion inhibitors, such as LK21 of this study. We have recently shown that MPER in the SARS-CoV spike protein interact with the internal FP (IFP) in a Trp-dependent manner [67]. In the same study, Trp\u2192Ala substitutions also resulted in MPER-containing peptides to lose the dose-dependent inhibition of coronavirus entry, correlating with the disruption of the MPER-IFP interaction. In gp41, Trp670 has previously been shown to mediate the MPER-FP interaction [70]. Its Ala substitution in the peptide LK21-5W5A could lead to a diminished affinity between the peptide and the FP in gp41, and hence contribute to the loss of the anti-viral effect of the peptide. Furthermore, penta-Trp\u2192Ala substitutions in LK21 prematurely predisposes the peptide to the final helical conformation, losing the lipidity-induced structural plasticity. It suggests that the potential interactions between MPER and other viral regions (such as FP) could also be conformation-dependent, and that the transition of MPER from an extended to helical conformation could result in an intermediate species for such interaction to take place.",

The optimal length of the linker between the monomers could be explored to enhance the flexibility of the unit peptide, which may further enhance the cooperative interactions between the peptide multimer and gp41.

Both antibodies have been shown to neutralize different strains of primary isolates of HIV-1 when administrated in cocktails in animal models [73]. Despite being proven difficult, a tetramer peptide mimetic containing the MPER sequence has elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies 4E10 and 2F5 in guinea pigs [74]. This rises the potential immunogenicity problem with the MPER-derived anti-viral peptides. However, any such immune responses is not expected to induce major adverse effects in host, as any elicited anti-HIV-MPER antibodies could probably be immunologically tolerated by the host, and may even further help to control the HIV replication. The direct evidence of the host immunological tolerance of 2F5 and 4E10 has been provided their recognition of two autoantigens, human kynureninase and splicing factor 3b subunit 3 [75]. Furthermore, T20 which contains the epitopes for 2F5 and 4E10 has not only been clinically proven to be safe and effective in the presence of cross-reactive antibodies [76], it has been shown to act synergistically with 4E10 in inhibiting viral infectivity [72].

The substitution of all five Trp to Ala in the MPER antiviral peptide resulted in it predominantly adopting a helical structure regardless of the environmental lipidity. This suggest that the Trp residues could be equally vital for the secondary structure of the MPER region within gp160, and consequently their substitution could hamper a proper folding and function of gp160. We further investigated the biological relevance of the MPER Trp residues in the biosynthesis of Env and other viral proteins. Previously, Salzwedel et al. found that Trp mutations in the MPER affected incorporation of Env into virions but no effect of the mutations was seen on the Env levels in the cell lysate or on the plasma membranes [17]. Here we observed that, in the transfected HLtat cells expressing pseudotyped HIV-1, Ala substitutions of all five Trp, the N-terminal three Trp (W664, W668, W670), and the C-terminal two Trp (W676 and W678) residues, although moderately, lowered the steady-state intracellular gp160 and intraviral gp41 levels without affecting the migration patterns as compared to WT. The discrepancy between their and our findings may be due to differences in the assay used to quantify Env, immunoprecipitation using patient serum versus immunoblotting.",

The results generally agreed with the previous understandings that Env expression inhibits the steady-state intracellular level of p55/Gag. It has been shown that the downregulation of p55/Gag expression by Env could be executed at both protein level through the Env cytoplasmic tail, or at RNA level through actions via the Rev response element within the env gene [78, 79]. In this study, the upregulation of Gag/p55 protein intracellular and intraviral levels were not proportional to the reduction of Env protein levels and interestingly the pseudo-HIV-1 in which the N-terminal three Trp or the C-terminal two Trp were substituted gave a much higher increase of p55/Gag than the pseudo-HIV-1 with all five Trp replaced with an Ala. Hence it remains an open question if there is another distinctive mechanism through which the Trp\u2192Ala mutations in Env MPER upregulated the Gag expression, besides through lowering the intracellular Env levels.",

Our data indicate that the Trp residues in Env MPER are important for the biosynthesis of Env and another major viral structural proteins p55/Gag, which could collectively affect the viral fitness and be an additional factor, besides the absence of membrane-active Trp indole ring sidechain, for the failed viral entry, as observed in a previous study [17] and confirmed in this study.",
