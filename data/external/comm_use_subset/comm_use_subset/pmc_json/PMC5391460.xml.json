Hantaviruses contain a tripartite negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome, including small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genes, which encode nucleocapsid protein (NP), glycoprotein (GP), and viral RNA-dependent polymerase protein (RdRp), respectively. Humans become infected by inhaling contaminated aerosols or by coming into contact with rodent excreta, and they develop two severe acute diseases, namely, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) (2). Hantavirus infection affects up to 100,000 to 200,000 humans annually, with fulminant HFRS cases most represented in China (3). Chinese HFRS cases, mainly caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection, account for approximately 90% of all global cases, with a mortality rate ranging from 0.1 to 15% (4). Since there is neither an effective therapeutic nor FDA-licensed vaccine, further understanding of host immune responses against hantaviral infection is of great significance for global public health and safety.",

Cellular pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs), can detect distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger the expression of IFNs and cytokines. RIG-I has been shown to recognize hantaviral invasion, but its regulatory process remains unclear (5). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important modulators of gene expression. lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is an essential architectural constituent of paraspeckles in the mammalian nucleus, interacting with Drosophila DBHS RNA-binding proteins such as the splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich protein (SFPQ) and the non-POU domain-containing, octamer-binding protein (NONO/p54) (6). To date, two isoform transcripts of the NEAT1 gene have been identified, namely, the 3.7-kb NEAT1-1 (MEN\u03b5) and the 23-kb NEAT1-2 (MEN\u03b2) (Fig. 1A). A large amount of research has shown that NEAT1 is associated with oncogenesis and tumor progression (7\u20139), promoting cancer formation in mice by dampening oncogene-dependent activation of p53 (10). Nevertheless, studies assessing the function of NEAT1 in viral infections are scarce.",

Silencing NEAT1 in vitro or in vivo suppressed host immune responses and aggravated HTNV infection, whereas NEAT1 overexpression in vitro enhanced beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) production and inhibited HTNV replication. Further investigation showed that NEAT1 promoted RIG-I and DDX60 expression by relocating SFPQ and removing the transcriptional inhibitory effects of SFPQ, which are critical for IFN responses against HTNV infection. We also found that RIG-I signaling, rather than TLR3 and TLR4, accounted for the elevation of HTNV-induced NEAT1. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism of host innate defense against HTNV infection.",

As shown in Fig. 1B, the NEAT1 level in the HTNV group was higher than that in the mock group (P = 6.86 \u00d7 10\u221213, false discovery rate [FDR] = 9.75 \u00d7 10\u221212) or the 60Co-inactivated HTNV group (P = 1.75 \u00d7 10\u221214, FDR = 3.10 \u00d7 10\u221213); however, the difference between the 60Co-inactivated HTNV group and the mock group was not significant (P = 0.21034, FDR = 0.58211). To confirm the profiling results, two primer pairs from the published literature (11), one recognizing both NEAT1-1 and NEAT1-2 and the other specific for NEAT1-2 (Fig. 1A), were applied to quantify NEAT1 RNA isoforms by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). It has been reported that NEAT1-2 rather than NEAT1-1 plays a key regulatory role in paraspeckle formation (11), and we also found that elevated NEAT1 levels depend on live HTNV infection rather than 60Co-inactivated HTNV stimulation (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes specific for NEAT1-2 was performed with HUVECs, and the results confirmed increased NEAT1-2 expression and the aggregation of NEAT1-2 in the nucleus at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 1D).",

Similar to the data obtained from HUVECs, NEAT1 was indeed upregulated by HTNV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 beginning at 24 hpi in HUVECs and A549, HEK293, and HeLa cells, and the increasing tendency occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1H). Of note, the NEAT1 elevation at 2 hpi might have been unrelated to the virus but resulted in cellular stress responses. Besides, NEAT1 expression increased from an MOI of 0.1 to 1, indicating that the elevation occurred in a viral dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1I).",

Of note, si-NEAT1 targets both NEAT1-1 and NEAT1-2, whereas the stealth siRNA NEAT1-2 (st-NEAT1-2) is specific for NEAT1-2. Compared with the cells transfected with control siRNA (negative control [NC]), HUVECs with si-NEAT1 could dramatically promote HTNV NP production, and NP expression seemed to be related to the amount of applied si-NEAT1 (Fig. 2B). Intriguingly, depletion of NEAT1-2 alone could mimic the antiviral effects of simultaneous NEAT1-1 and NEAT1-2 silencing (Fig. 2C), indicating that NEAT1-2 was critical for the antiviral responses. Consistent with those data, the expressions of HTNV mRNA of S segment (Fig. 2D) and HTNV titers (Fig. 2E) were increased after NEAT1 silencing.",

Surprisingly, we found NEAT1-1 overexpression restricted NEAT1-2 transcription (Fig. 2F). Overexpression of NEAT1 with both pCMV-NEAT1-1 and pCMV-NEAT1-2 could conspicuously repress HTNV NP expression, and NP expression seemed to be associated with the transfected plasmids (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, overexpression of NEAT1-2 instead of NEAT1-1 could efficiently suppress HTNV replication (Fig. 2H). NEAT1-1 upregulation even aggravated HTNV infection (Fig. 2H), which may be the result of downregulation of NEAT1-2. Consistently, through analysis of viral load detected by qRT-PCR and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) test by ELISA, we found that expression of HTNV-specific mRNA (Fig. 2I) and HTNV titers (Fig. 2J) were limited in HUVECs in which NEAT1-2 was ectopically expressed in comparison to those transfected with control vector or pCMV-NEAT1-1. These data further showed that NEAT1-2 and not NEAT1-1 suppresses HTNV replication in HUVECs.",

It has been reported that the GnT of hantaviruses suppressed IFN-\u03b2 expression of host cells at an early stage of infection (14). Here, we also found that HUVECs could not efficiently produce IFN-\u03b2 until 12 hpi at an MOI of 0.1 or until 24 hpi at an MOI of 1 (Fig. 3A), which indicated that high doses of HTNV could hamper prompt IFN responses. Notably, enhanced NEAT1-2 transcription appeared at 8 hpi at an MOI of 0.1 or at 20 hpi at an MOI of 1 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that NEAT1-2 expression increased just before IFN production. We found that expression of endogenous IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was much lower in cells transfected with si-NEAT1-2 at MOIs of both 0.1 (Fig. 3C) and 1 (Fig. 3D) than in those transfected with control siRNA (NC). In contrast, overexpression of NEAT1 in HUVECs increased IFN-\u03b2 expression after HTNV infection (MOI = 1) at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 3E). More importantly, HUVECs transfected with pCMV-NEAT1-2 conspicuously increased IFN-\u03b2 gene expression compared with those cells with vector plasmids at 12 hpi (MOI = 1), demonstrating that NEAT1-2 overexpression accelerated robust IFN responses in host cells against HTNV infection. With a dual luciferase reporter system maintaining IFN-\u03b2 promoters, we found NEAT1-2 silencing or overexpression could inhibit or increase the promoter activity of the IFN-\u03b2 gene after HTNV infection, respectively, whereas silencing NEAT1-2 or ectopically expressing NEAT1-2 without HTNV infection could not inhibit or enhance IFN-\u03b2 expression (Fig. 3F). These results showed that NEAT1-2 regulated HTNV-induced IFN-\u03b2 expression.",

In addition, in cells with high NEAT1-2 expression, treatment with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 could counteract the antiviral effects of NEAT1-2 (MOI = 1), and the compensatory effects were dependent on the magnitude of the NAbs.

The upregulated RIG-I and DDX60 were blocked in the cells with low NEAT1-2 expression after HTNV infection (Fig. 4A). HUVECs with declining NEAT1-2 expression showed gradually decreasing expression of RIG-I and DDX60 (Fig. 4B), and increasing NEAT1-2 transcription was found to activate RIG-I and DDX60 production accordingly (Fig. 4C).

Interestingly, the protein level of SFPQ, as well as another paraspeckle-forming constituent, NONO, remained unchanged after HTNV infection (Fig. 5B) or after NEAT1 overexpression and knockdown (Fig. 5C). However, SFPQ became centralized rather than diffuse in the nucleus after HTNV infection (Fig. 5D). The enhanced interaction of SFPQ and NONO indicated excess formation of paraspeckles in the nucleus (Fig. 5E) and relocalization of SFPQ. SFPQ knockdown could inhibit HTNV replication (Fig. 5F and G), which might have been related to the increase in RIG-I (Fig. 5H) and DDX60 (Fig. 5I). SFPQ has been suggested to bind to the promoter region of RIG-I and DDX60 (11), thus preventing the expression of RIG-I and DDX60. Taken together, the above results suggested that NEAT1 might relocate SFPQ from the potential promoter region to paraspeckles in the nucleus and remove the transcriptional inhibitory effects of SFPQ, thus facilitating the expression of RIG-I and DDX60.",

Moreover, using STAT1 as a positive control, we found that the transcription factor IRF7, rather than IRF3 and p65, translocated into the nucleus in HTNV-infected HUVECs at 2 dpi (Fig. 7D).

To address this question, we intravenously injected siRNAs targeting mouse NEAT1-2 at 1 day before HTNV infection. NEAT1-2 expression levels in the liver, kidney, and spleen were reduced at 2 dpi (Fig. 8A). Previous studies have shown that NEAT1 knockout does not affect physiological processes except potentia generandi in mice; hence, we assessed its role under pathological conditions. Body weight loss in NEAT1-2-depleted mice was observed from 2 dpi to 5 dpi, and the IFN production in serum was remarkably decreased in the NEAT1-2 silenced group than those in the NC group at 3 dpi (Fig. 8B). As expected, NEAT1-2 knockdown mice showed considerably higher HTNV NP levels in the liver, spleen, and kidney at 3 dpi (Fig. 8C). Moreover, the virus titers in related organs were higher in the NEAT1-2 silenced group than in the NC group (Fig. 8D). In addition, reduced inflammatory cell filtration but increased tissue injury was found in NEAT1-2 knockdown mice during the early stage of infection (Fig. 8E). Infiltration of macrophages in the spleen was attenuated (Fig. 8F), and the activation of macrophages was also suppressed (by flow cytometry; data not shown). Moreover, CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ T cells were reduced in the spleens of NEAT1-2 knockdown mice in comparison to those in the NC group at 3 dpi (Fig. 8G). Nevertheless, NEAT1-2 silencing had no effect on the production of neutralizing antibodies at 7 dpi (data not shown). The above-described findings indicated that NEAT1-2 depletion might influence multiple aspects of the innate immune response in HTNV-infected mice.",

In this report, we first demonstrated that NEAT1 was induced by HTNV through the RIG-I\u2013IRF7 pathway and served as positive feedback for RIG-I signaling. Using DGE analysis, we observed upregulated NEAT1 and confirmed its alteration in different cell lines. To assess its effects on HTNV replication, NEAT1 was silenced both in vitro and in vivo, which resulted in increased HTNV infection and suppressed innate immune responses. Further analysis indicated that NEAT1 might interact with SFPQ and regulate DDX60 and RIG-I expression.

Among these noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerged as important regulators of gene expression and are closely related to the activation of the host innate immune system. TLR2 controls lncRNA-COX2 expression in a MyD88- and NF-\u03baB-dependent manner, whereas lncRNA-COX either promotes interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion or represses ISG15 and CCL5 expression (20). TLR2 activation or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) stimulation induces transcription of the lncRNA THRIL, the downregulation of which impairs TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion (21). TLR4 signaling in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces lncRNA IL-1\u03b2-eRNA and IL-1\u03b2-RBT46, the knockdown of which attenuates IL-1\u03b2 and CXCL8 release (22).

Various viruses, such as influenza virus (IAV), coronavirus, enterovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and rabies virus, have been reported to activate the transcription of different lncRNAs in host cells (11, 24\u201326). Importantly, multiple lncRNAs have been shown to affect the IFN response in recent years and have gradually become hot spots in the field of antiviral research. NeST was shown to enhance IFN-\u03b3 production, controlling the susceptibility of mice to persistent Theiler's virus infection as well as resistance to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection (27). Both CMPK2 and NRAV were identified as negative regulators of IFN immune reactions. CMPK2, induced by IFN-\u03b1 or HCV infection, suppresses various ISGs, the knockdown of which dramatically blocks HCV replication (26). NRAV inhibits some critical ISGs, such as IFITM3 and Mx1, the depletion of which suppresses IAV replication both in vitro and in vivo (25). Numerous lncRNAs, including lnc-ISG15 and ISR2, respond to IFNs such as ISGs, although their actual function requires further investigation (28). Considering the poor evolutionary conservation but rapid divergence of lncRNAs, their functions may be highly species and virus specific. Though considerable progress has been achieved to demonstrate the antiviral effects of lncRNAs on model viruses, there are no published reports assessing the role of lncRNAs in hantaviral infection.",

The versatile function of NEAT1 is rapidly progressing in multiple areas of biology. NEAT1 has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple types of cancer (7\u20139). NEAT1 also participates in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (29) and seems to potentially contribute to the elevated production of a number of cytokines and chemokines in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (30). Furthermore, poly I\u00b7C can activate NEAT1 transcription through the TLR3 pathway, whereas NEAT1 positively regulates IL-8 transcription and potentially affects the expression of multiple ISGs after poly I\u00b7C stimulation (11). In addition, NEAT1 has been reported to suppress the export of Rev-dependent instability element (INS)-containing HIV-1 mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting HIV replication (24).

Elevated NEAT1 promotes IFN secretion, most likely by enhancing RIG-I and DDX60 expression. DDX60, a DEXD/H box RNA helicase similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ski2, is induced after viral infection (31). DDX60 recognizes viral RNA and activates endogenous RIG-I, thereby promoting the RIG-I signaling-related IFN response. However, the antiviral effects of DDX60 seem to vary among viruses (17). We found that NEAT1-regulated DDX60 was involved in IFN production in response to HTNV infection. In HTNV-infected cells, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) could not be detected, and it is unclear how host PRRs, especially RIG-I, recognize HTNV invasion (5). Here, considering the interaction of RIG-I and DDX60 and the effect of DDX60 on IFN-\u03b2 production, we hypothesize that DDX60 might mediate RIG-I signaling activation upon HTNV infection, which requires further investigation.",

HTNV primarily targets vascular endothelial cells in vivo and contributes to the increased vascular permeability and coagulation disorders in HFRS; hence, HUVECs are the most common in vitro cell model to study host innate immunity against HTNV infection or viral pathogenesis (32). EVC-304 cells are also endovascular cells, whereas EVC-304 TLR4\u2212 cells are TLR4-deleted cells, both of which have been used for HTNV infection related studies (15, 33). A549 cells were once used to isolate HTNV, and they were confirmed to be a mature model of infection (34\u201337). Additionally, Huh 7.0 and Huh 7.5 (RIG-I\u2212) cells used in our study have been reported to be infected by HTNV by Lee et al. (5) and can be used as a cell model to study immune responses against HTNV replication (38, 39). Additionally, HEK293 (40) and HeLa (41) cells have been reported to be infected by HTNV. Using qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays, we have also shown that both HEK293 and HeLa cells can be infected by HTNV. To study the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of NEAT1 on IFN expression and HTNV infection, it may be suitable to use HEK293 and HeLa cells as a cell model, especially under conditions in which HTNV NP can be detected using Western blot or immunofluorescence analyses.",

The NP spotted and exhibited in the ICW results forms obvious stains that mimic PFU. However, the specific values scanned and analyzed by the ICW assay reflect only the fluorescence intensity of the integral well instead of the number of spots. As a consequence, the intensity represented the quantity of NP production but could not directly indicate the virulence, which was better shown by plaque-forming assays. The RNAi studies in vivo are encouraging (Fig. 8), but the NC used by our group was not mutated si-NEAT1-2 (i.e., same sense strand, but with a point mutation in the targeting strand).

We noticed that silencing NEAT1-2 or ectopically expressing NEAT1-2 could not inhibit or enhance IFN expression without HTNV infection (Fig. 3F), which indicated that NEAT1-2 could not directly affect IFN-\u03b2 expression. This finding excludes the possibility that NEAT1-2 directly promoted IFN-\u03b2 and that IFN-\u03b2 promoted the expression of PRRs such as RIG-I. Thereafter, NEAT1 was found to modulate HTNV-induced RIG-I and DDX60 expression. Recent findings have shown that RIG-I signaling is essential for an efficient polyfunctional T cell response during IAV infection (42). Indeed, we found that the function of T cells was suppressed after NEAT1-2 depletion in our animal experiments (Fig. 8G), which might be due to the disrupted RIG-I signaling in NEAT1-2 silenced T cells.",

Host PRRs such as RIG-I can recognize the PAMPs of viruses and induce robust innate immune responses against viral infection. Known signaling is shown in boxes outlined in red. Our research indicated that RIG-I and DDX60 might interact with each other to recognize HTNV, which, on the one hand, promotes IFN and cytokine production, and, on the other hand, induces NEAT1 transcription through the RIG-I\u2013IRF7 pathway. As positive feedback, NEAT1 promoted RIG-I and DDX60 expression and enhanced HTNV-induced IFN responses. The specific molecular mechanism might be that NEAT1 relocates SFPQ from the potential promoter region to paraspeckles in the nucleus, thereby facilitating the expression of multiple antiviral genes. Taken together, the lncRNA NEAT1 can exert antihantaviral effects by modulating host innate immune responses.",
