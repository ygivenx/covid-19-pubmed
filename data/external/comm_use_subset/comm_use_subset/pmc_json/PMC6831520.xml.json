However, an important proportion of those patients lack a suitable human leucocyte antigen (HLA) match donor or delay for donor availability may be unacceptable (1). For patients needing an allogeneic transplant in a timely manner, the use of haploidentical relative donors has been considered a suitable approach (2, 3). Donor T-cells in the graft facilitate T-cell reconstitution but they are also responsible for graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Currently, several haploidentical transplant platforms using \u201cex-vivo\u201d T-cell depletion (TCD) without using post-transplant GvHD pharmacological prophylaxis have gained clinical relevance (4, 5).",

However, NK cell phenotype was altered and cytotoxicity was lower compared with their donors in pediatric patients receiving CD3+/CD19+ depleted haploidentical transplantation (7). The mentioned TCD haploidentical transplantation platform was associated with encouraging results especially in patients in the early phase of disease (8). KIR-B haplotype donors conferred a rapid NK cell expansion early after transplant, which resulted in lower probability of relapse.

Progenitor cells collections were performed by leukapheresis. In all, 66 products were obtained by large-volume leukapheresis procedure according to established protocols of the center using a continuous flow blood cell separator (Spectra Optia MNC v.3.0. Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO; USA or COBE Spectra TM, v.6.1, by Caridian BCT Europe, Garching, Germany) on the fifth day of mobilization and the day before infusion. Apheresis was carried out via bilateral peripheral veins whenever possible, or otherwise by a central venous catheter. During leukapheresis, between 3 and 5 blood volumes were processed. Acid citrate dextrose (ACD-A) was used as an anticoagulant with a ratio of 14:1. Leukapheresis products were also analyzed for expression of the CD34+ antigen as previously reported (8). Concurrent plasma (200\u2013300 mL), was collected for products to be stored overnight after receipt into the processing facility.

Nowadays, several haploidentical transplant platforms have gained clinical relevance using \u201cex-vivo\u201d T-cell depletion (TCD) (19). In TCD haploidentical setting, different techniques of graft manipulation have been developed over last 15 years to avoid or minimize undesirable GvHD (19\u201321). These techniques have evolved from the initial almost total T and B cells depletion by means of CD34+ isolation and CD3+/CD19+ depletion to more recently graft manipulation techniques such as \u03b1\u03b2+ TCR/CD19+ or CD45RA+ depletions that resulted in partial TCD maintaining NK cells in an attempt to improve immune reconstitution following transplantation (22, 23). An approach to circumvent delayed immune recovery represented by a more sophisticated method of graft manipulation that has been recently developed and implemented is based on selective depletion of \u03b1\u03b2+ T-cells and B-cells (10). This strategy allows not only the infusion of donor hematopoietic stem cells, but also committed hematopoietic progenitors, mature NK cells, and \u03b3\u03b4+ T-cells. Recently, haploidentical transplant after \u03b1\u03b2+ T-cell/B-cell depletion has shown to be effective in single-center studies (10). In these studies, myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning regimens combined with serotherapy have been used. Other reported studies used chemotherapy-based conditioning regimens even with no serotherapy as part of conditioning (7\u20139, 11). Children with acute leukemia receiving haploidentical transplant using \u03b1\u03b2+ T-cell/B-cell depletion had a relatively lower risk for acute and chronic GVHD even than those transplanted from an unrelated donor. However, major challenges were relapsing disease and delayed immune reconstitution leading infectious morbidity and mortality (11). So, immune reconstitution studies and risk factors for transplant outcome analysis using this TCD haploidentical platform are needed. Herein, we reported the risk factors analysis and a detailed analysis of immune reconstitution and its impact on transplant outcomes in a prospective study using haploidentical transplant with \u03b1\u03b2+ T-cell/B-cell depletion after chemotherapy-based conditioning regimen with no serotherapy.",

As other authors (10, 20, 21) have noted, grafts so depleted, contain high numbers of graft-facilitating cells and CD34+ cells, and result on enhanced engraftment and immune recovery. Graft failure was lower than reported (8) with other previous graft manipulation procedures using the same conditioning regimen and very similar to other published studies using TBI-based conditioning with or without serotherapy as part of preparatory regimen. Non-radiation-based preparative regimens have be used in pediatric patients with high-risk acute leukemia and busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning regimens have been reported safe and effective in hematopoietic transplantation (11). An important observation in this study was the fact that the conditioning regimen was well-tolerated (Table 3), with a low incidence of severe complications, similar to that of recently published in adults (25) and children (7\u20139). However, we have observed a high incidence of severe VOD/SOS in non-Caucasian population not previously observed and reported. This complication was associated with high mortality in the mentioned population. Non-Caucasian (mainly white Hispanic) patients are being increasingly included in the transplant program at our institution. It is possible that there is an interethnic variability in genetic polymorphisms frequencies for metabolizing enzymes that probably influence toxicity incidence such as VOD/SOS. Based in our findings, ethnicity should be considered as potential risk factor for further prospective VOD/SOS studies.",

            "text": "Second, immune reconstitution was preceded by a rapid and sustained appearance of NK-cells (Supplemental Table 2). Immune reconstitution after allogeneic transplantation depends on multiple factors such as stem cell source and dose (26), graft manipulation procedure (6\u20139), donor age (13), conditioning regimen, and post-transplant immunosuppression used. We (7, 8) and others (6, 24, 26) previously reported that immune reconstitution in children receiving TCD haploidentical transplant was characterized by early and fast NK-cell recovery constituting major lymphocyte subpopulation in the early phase following transplantation. NK-cells in the graft and fast NK-cell recovery have been considered of importance in allogeneic transplant especially on haploidentical transplant. After conditioning, blood high level of interleukin-15 provides a favorable environment not only for mature donor NK-cell infused but also for NK-cells maturing from engrafted HSCs (27). NK-cell reconstitution and its function following haploidentical transplant is clearly influenced by GvHD prophylaxis, especially by post-cyclophosphamide that eliminate most mature donor NK cells including alloreactive NK cells as it has been recently published (27).",

However, a similar analysis has not been published in the TCD haploidentical setting. A recent study in pediatric patients, receiving \u03b1\u03b2+ T-cell depletion haploidentical transplant, showed an overshooting NK cell recovery on day +14 comparable to their donor level (29). Despite a rapid expansion of CD56bright NK cell subset, CD56dim NK cells were predominant during the study time period (29). However, they did not report any correlation between CD56dim or CD56bright recovery and relapse incidence. Our previous data indicate that the number of total NK cells early after transplantation was a strong determinant of GvL effect (8).

NK cells have a powerful activity against virus transformed cells and cancers cells specially AML cells (30, 31). This activity against cancer cells is mainly supported by CD56dim cytotoxic activity (32\u201334). CD56bright population has a different cytokine profile resulting in lower cytotoxicity against cancer cells. So, the higher CD56dim/CD56bright NK cell ratio might result in more cytotoxicity exerted by CD56dim subset and in lower risk of relapse. Unfortunately, we do not have data on cytotoxicity in our series to support this explanation. Alternatively, NK cells could act as a boost for T-cell activation that might increase the T-cell based GvL effect. However, our data clearly shows that T-cell recovery is delayed for a longer period of time following transplant especially \u03b1\u03b2+ T-cells.",
