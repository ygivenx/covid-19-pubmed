Since MDRGN frequently cause community and healthcare-associated infections in almost all countries and medical disciplines [9\u201311], efforts to prevent infections caused by MDRGN should therefore not only address adequate usage of antibiotics and the development of strategies to prevent spread of MDRGN, but also on enhancement of the knowledge of MDRGN transmission, especially in hospital settings. Overcrowding has been shown to promote the spread of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in medical wards [12\u201314]. Overcrowding was mentioned as well as one major factor in the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to SARS-coronavirus (CoV) in healthcare workers [15]. Transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is also promoted by overcrowding [16, 17]. In neonatal units overcrowding has also been shown to foster the spread of gram-negative bacteria and central venous lines (CVC) associated bloodstream infections [18]. Overcrowding therefore should be considered to promote transmission and spread of MDRGN on neonatal units.",

Moreover, if kangarooing should be provided, 2 m space is needed to place deckchairs and to allow parents enough space. During OV, kangarooing was less likely and parental presence between two beds was limited. In this special setting, bed-to-bed distance of 1\u20131.2 m seemed to be sufficient in terms of preventing MRE transmission.",

Data on incidence, time course, and outcome of MDRGN transmission by breast milk are not available and prospective studies will not be performed due to ethical reasons. Thus, individual adjusted risk management, weighing the benefits of mother milk nutrition for the individual patient (e.g. reduced risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)) against the probability of MDRGN transmission (either vertical or nosocomial) and potential biological hazard, especially in case of colonization with MDRGN, is recommended [25, 26, 29].",

The transmission of E. cloacae Ceph between baby C and baby E has been verified via molecularbiological techniques. This transmission event shows that unexpected parental misbehavior \u2013 e.g. due to language barriers \u2013 can counteract any attempt of infection control.
