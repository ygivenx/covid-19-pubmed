Once recognized, if the target site on the mRNA has nearly perfect complementarity to the guide siRNA, the mRNA is cut by an Argonaute endonuclease in the RISC and then degraded, silencing the expression of the protein it encodes. Typically protein expression is reduced but not completely eliminated. The RNAi machinery is present in all cells, where it is used to regulate the expression of key genes involved in cell development, differentiation, and survival. Small RNAs can be readily designed to target any gene, whether an endogenous host gene or foreign viral gene. For example, for HIV virtually all of the nine HIV gene products have been shown to be capable of being silenced, and siRNAs targeting the viral long terminal repeat are also effective (\nFigure 1).\n",

Over 90% of plant viruses use double-stranded RNA at some point in their life cycle, making them especially vulnerable to Dicer cleavage and suppression by RNAi.

Several mRNAs encoded by a primate retrovirus contain complementary sequences that are targeted by an endogenous microRNA. Moreover viral variants with a mutated target sequence replicate more efficiently. Several examples of mammalian virus strategies for interfering with RNAi have been described, suggesting the viruses are trying to bypass an antiviral host response [\n1]. One strategy, analogous to the suppression of silencing exhibited by plant viruses, is elaboration of proteins, such as NS1 of influenza and E3L of vaccinia, that bind to and inactivate double-stranded RNAs. Another strategy, employed by adenovirus, is copious expression of a microRNA that binds to and inactivates the microRNA export and Dicer processing machinery.\n",

Silencing viral genes such as viral polymerases or master regulators of viral gene transcription (which are essential for fundamental viral processes), or silencing viral genes that act early in the viral life cycle, may more effectively suppress viral replication than targeting late genes or accessory viral genes that contribute to pathogenesis (but that are not vital for viral replication). In vitro studies have shown the usefulness of RNAi in vitro to suppress virtually every class of virus, whether a virus uses double-stranded, single-positive, or negative-strand RNA or DNA for its genome. Algorithms for siRNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) design provide guidance for designing effective sequences, but this process is imperfect (with a success rate of over 60%). The algorithms do not predict which sequences will be most effective at silencing their target gene. Nor do they predict which sequences maximize viral inhibition and minimize sequence-specific off-target effects arising from unintended silencing of partially homologous genes or from sequence-specific binding to Toll-like receptors, which triggers an inflammatory response. The best candidate siRNA sequences need to be determined by experiment. Off-target silencing of genes with partial homology is impossible to avoid because inhibition of translation may involve complementarity to just a seven-nucleotide stretch of the siRNA. However, translational inhibition generally has only a small impact on gene expression, can be minimized by avoiding sequences that target important genes, and is unlikely to be an important impediment to the clinical use of RNAi, although clinically significant toxicity from off-target effects will be difficult to predict in advance. Off-target effects caused by incorporation of the passenger strand, instead of the antisense strand, of the siRNA into RISC can be avoided by designing the siRNA ends to favor RISC uptake by the intended active strand.",

A recent strategy that uses an antibody fragment fusion protein to bind and deliver siRNAs only into cells bearing the cell surface receptor recognized by the antibody can deliver siRNAs and silence gene expression specifically in HIV-infected cells [\n7]. Expression of an shRNA designed to silence a host protein required for HIV replication might be induced only upon HIV infection by using a TAT-dependent promoter [\n8].

For the encephalitis viruses, Kumar and colleagues' study suggests it might be possible to administer a cocktail of siRNAs that could effectively suppress a variety of likely suspect viruses before a definitive diagnosis is made, thus avoiding a dangerous delay in treatment. For any particular virus, a cocktail of siRNAs targeting viral and host genes whose products act at different points in the viral life cycle is likely to act synergistically to suppress viral replication more effectively and hence reduce the chance of viral escape mutation [\n12]. However, the cellular RNAi machinery has limited capacity since silencing can be suppressed by an excess of irrelevant double-stranded small RNAs, a strategy used by adenovirus for suppressing RNAi [\n13]. Similarly, gene therapy vectors that express high amounts of shRNAs can cause toxicity by interfering with the nuclear export of endogenous microRNAs [\n14]. Therefore, there is probably a limit to the number of siRNAs that can be effectively incorporated into any treatment. However, no published study has yet defined this limit.\n",

            "text": "Although therapeutic delivery of siRNAs and silencing is clearly feasible at mucosal surfaces, systemic treatment of viruses that are disseminated or infect tissues deep within the body is more difficult because of the challenge of efficiently transducing cells in vivo. The main impediments to systemic uptake are the difficulty in traversing the cell membrane and the short half-life of intravenously injected siRNAs. Several potential solutions to the former problem have been described recently, including covalent conjugation of the passenger siRNA strand to a cell-targeting moiety, noncovalent association of siRNAs with cell-targeting molecules, and incorporation of siRNAs into liposomes or other nanoparticles [\n7,\n20,\n21]. The short half-life, which is caused by both rapid renal filtration and endogenous ribonuclease digestion, can be readily addressed by incorporating siRNAs into complexes or particles and by minor chemical modifications of the RNA backbone. Early studies showing inhibition of hepatitis viral replication required introducing siRNAs via a high-volume bolus (termed hydrodynamic injection) that causes right-sided heart failure and is not suitable for clinical use. Although siRNAs can be effectively introduced into an organ, such as the liver or kidney, by selective catheterization of the principal vein draining the tissue [\n22], this is invasive and costly. Similarly, the intracerebral injection approach used to deliver siRNAs targeting flaviviruses is not likely to be used clinically. Intravenous low-pressure injection of chemically modified siRNAs incorporated into modified liposomes reduced replication of a hepatitis B virus replicon in mice [\n21]. This study was the first demonstration of a systemic antiviral effect using a method of injection that is clinically feasible.\n",
