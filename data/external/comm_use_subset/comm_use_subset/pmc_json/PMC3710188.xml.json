Leading communicable diseases from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to diarrheal diseases, measles, and lower respiratory infections claim upwards of eleven million lives in these countries each year\n[1]. The burden falls disproportionately not only on some countries, but also on vulnerable parts of the population. Notably, 95 percent of deaths from respiratory infections and 98 percent of deaths from diarrheal diseases occur in LMICs\n[2]; and diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, and malaria take many lives of children under five. Similarly, infectious diseases like schistosomiasis, hookworm and malaria contribute to anemia, worsening outcomes both of mother and child in pregnancy, while syphilis also adversely affects neonatal mortality. As for diseases that make up substantial portions of global disease burden--HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria\u2014over 95 percent of the deaths caused by each of these diseases are also in LMICs. The toll of infectious diseases comes in mortality and morbidity, lost work productivity and economic losses, and the drag effect on those trapped or tipped into poverty by illness.",

AMFm worked to negotiate for lower prices of artemisinin combination treatment (ACT) with manufacturers, subsidize the purchase of ACTs through copayments, and support interventions that encourage rational use of ACTs. By sharply reducing the retail prices of ACTs, the initiative hoped to displace oral artemisinin monotherapies and other medicines, such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, to which resistance had emerged. UNITAID, the Gates Foundation and DFID supported the piloting of this intervention with US$216 million while the Global Fund complemented this, committing up to US$127 million towards supporting interventions for scaling up ACT use effectively [[12]].",

Early findings from the Health Action International pricing survey in six African countries showed that the AMFm price bested the originator brand and the lowest-priced generic, approaching but not yet consistently beating the prices of irrational alternatives, like chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [[13]]. In less than a year though, six out of eight pilot countries met or exceeded benchmarks for availability, price and market share of quality-assured ACTs, both in rural and urban areas [[14]]. Efforts in Tanzania showed that accredited drug dispensing outlets could complement these upstream interventions by increasing access to and dispensing of subsidized artemisinin combination therapy [[15]]. However, the volatility in artemisinin supply upstream has caused significant price fluctuations in the pricing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of this drug. Though it may not offset entirely the greater demand for artemisinin from an expanded AMFm, the anticipated advent of artemisinin, sourced from microbial production, by late 2012 is a technology that may help stabilize and secure the supply of this critical drug for ACT [[16]].",

Similarly, the anchoring of the GlaxoSmithKline-initiated Pool for Open Innovation Against Tropical Neglected Diseases and WIPO Re:Search Consortium--both efforts to pool building blocks of knowledge and to license them royalty-free to those working on neglected diseases--places limits on geographic coverage to only least developed countries as a starting condition.",

The same study found that both the research institutions most productive in publishing journal articles and filing patents were concentrated in a few countries in Africa (notably South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt). Examining patterns of collaboration on biomedical publications, over three-quarters of these journal articles were co-authored with collaborators, but only 5.4 percent engaged institutions in more than one African country while the preponderant majority of articles involved collaborators in Europe or the United States. This pattern of collaboration, in part, motivated the formation of the African Network for Drugs and Diagnostics Innovation, with its focus on intra-African coordination and collaboration on R&D.",

Some work by aggregating research inputs upstream in the R&D pipeline, and others recruit patented drugs downstream in the R&D pipeline. For example, the Medicines Patent Pool\u2019s mission is to secure voluntary licenses from pharmaceutical companies of HIV/AIDS drugs that might be used in new fixed-dose combinations or pediatric formulations. In so doing, the generic licensing of such combinations is meant to stir greater competition and thereby innovation and affordability of such treatments. Negotiating licenses, limited by field and geography, has proven challenging. To date, the only license with a company for AIDS medicines has been with Gilead.

With Gates Foundation support, the University of California, Berkeley extended co-exclusive licenses for the microbial synthesis of artemisinin--a key antimalarial drug--to Amyris Biotechnologies and the Institute for One World Health\n[44]. The University made the license royalty-free for malaria indications in exchange for Amyris Biotechnologies\u2019 commitment to produce artemisinin at no profit for treating malaria in the developing world. Amyris, in return, also received substantial philanthropic capital support (US$12 million) from the Gates Foundation. This enabled Amyris to develop proof of concept on its microbial synthesis process, which also has a dual market application for synthesizing biofuels.",

From Merck\u2019s early efforts to place expressed sequence tags into the public domain to corporate participation in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Consortium, pharmaceutical firms have understood the need to harness ideas from outside their walls to fuel in-house R&D innovation. The potential application for open innovation is most evident for emerging infectious diseases, where the patenting process might be outpaced by the speed of a spreading pandemic. The need for pooling patents on SARS to enable non-exclusive licensing anticipated the potential problems of intellectual property holdings on developing a diagnostic or treatment for the illness. However, the SARS epidemic came and went before the patent pool could be launched, highlighting the potential value of open innovation norms for emerging diseases.",

By contrast, open source innovation involves openness and transparency with the goal of shared research collaboration, but also prevents third parties from acquiring proprietary rights over what is generated by the community. Notably, India\u2019s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has embarked on the Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) initiative, initially focused on TB drugs. Using a web-based platform, hundreds of volunteers at a network of universities, both in India and elsewhere, have collaborated on re-annotating the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. Their collective efforts made this possible in just four months. Supported with government funding, participants submit projects for open peer review, contribute to on-line efforts under a system of microattribution, and agree to sharing their work under a click-wrap license. In not pursuing a conventional path to drug discovery, OSDD hopes to \u201cbring down the cost of drug discovery significantly by knowledge sharing and constructive collaboration\u201d and \u201cto discover new chemical entities and to make them generic as soon as they are discovered, thus expediting the process of drug discovery\u201d\n[49].",
