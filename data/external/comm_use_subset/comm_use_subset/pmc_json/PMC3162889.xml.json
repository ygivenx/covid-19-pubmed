Despite advancements in surgical techniques, lung preservation, immunosuppression, and management of ischemia/reperfusion injury and infections, acute and chronic allograft rejection continues to be a major problem. The incidence and severity of acute rejection in lung transplantation exceeds all other solid organ transplants [1,2]. Chronic rejection, more commonly called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is the leading cause of death beyond the first year post lung transplantation [3,4]. The key clinical feature of BOS is the development of airway obstruction with a reduction of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) that does not respond to bronchodilators (Table 1) [5,6]. The hallmark histological findings of chronic rejection is obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), which is an inflammatory process affecting small noncartilagenous airways [7,8]. Figure 1 is representative of the typical findings of OB histopathologically. The development of BOS is rare within the first year after lung transplant, but the cumulative incidence ranges from 43 to 80% within the first five years of transplantation [4,9-11].",

Due to the sporadic or patchy involvement of OB, pathologic diagnosis can be missed by transbronchial biopsies (TBB) [5], which are often performed to exclude other diagnoses including acute rejection or infection. Histologically, early lesions of BOS demonstrate submucosal lymphocytic inflammation and disruption of the epithelium of small airways, followed by an ingrowth of fibromyxoid granulation tissue into the airway lumen, resulting in partial or complete obstruction. Subsequently, granulation tissue organizes in a cicatricial pattern with resultant fibrosis and thus obliterates the airway lumen [12]. In some instances, the only residual histologic evidence of BOS is a ring of circumferential elastin around an otherwise undetectable airway, what is termed the \"vanishing airways disease\" [12].",

The group concluded that the FEV1 was the most reliable and consistent indicator of allograft dysfunction, excluding other identifiable causes with the adoption of the term BOS to describe such dysfunction, recognizing that there may or may not be pathologic evidence of OB present [13]. The group also defined 4 stages of BOS, each with 2 subcategories to indicate whether pathologic evidence of OB had been identified [13].",

            "text": "The clinical course of BOS can vary from insidious onset and gradual decline in pulmonary function over months to years to abrupt onset with severe decline in pulmonary function over a few weeks [14-16]. The clinical diagnosis of BOS requires a sustained pulmonary decline with a reduced FEV1 for more than 3 weeks and the exclusion of acute allograft rejection, anastomotic complications or stricture, infection, or other disease affecting pulmonary function. In comparison, acute allograft rejection is defined as perivascular or peribronchial mononuclear inflammation that may be associated with an acute reduction in pulmonary function. Clinical presentation of acute allograft rejection may vary from asymptomatic patients with acute rejection found on surveillance biopsy to non-specific symptoms including cough, dyspnea, sputum production, fever, hypoxia, and adventitious sounds on lung auscultation [8,15]. The current classification of BOS is based on changes in FEV1 with the maximum post-transplant FEV1 being assigned a 100% predicted value (the mean of the two best postoperative FEV1 values with at least 3 weeks between the measurements) and the reduction in the mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity (FEF25-75%) used as an early marker for BOS or potential BOS [5]. The current ISHLT classification system for BOS is outlined in Table 1.",

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has also been well described as a potential risk factor in the development of BOS; [19,37,38] however, one study demonstrated that histopathologically confirmed CMV pneumonia treated with ganciclovir was not a risk factor for BOS or patient survival nor was any particular CMV serologic donor/recipient group [39]. The treatment of CMV and the subsequent prevention of BOS remains unclear. In a more recent study, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation detection by repeated EBV DNA analysis of blood in lung transplant recipients was associated with the development of BOS [40].",

The mechanism by which GE reflux contributes to BOS remains unclear. The presence of bile acids and pepsin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from lung transplant recipients suggests that aspiration may elicit airway injury [44,45]. Moreover, treatment with proton pump inhibitors reduced acid reflux but did not affect nonacid reflux, including bile or pepsin, suggesting the presence of these elements in the lower airways as factors associated with BOS [45]. Early surgical treatment of GE reflux with fundoplication after lung transplantation has been associated with greater freedom from BOS and has improved survival [46,47]. A single institution study reported that 93/128 (73%) of lung transplant recipients had abnormal ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH probe results [46]. After fundoplication, 16 patients had improved BOS scores, with 13 of these patients no longer meeting the criteria for BOS [46]. Another small study demonstrated that early aggressive surgical treatment of GE reflux with fundoplication not only improved rates of BOS but also survival [47].",

More recently, a single center randomized study demonstrated improvement in the pulmonary function of lung transplant patients who received aerosolized cyclosporine for the first 2 years after transplantation compared to placebo [60]. A recent case report demonstrated that aerosolized tacrolimus was associated with improvement in both functional capacity and oxygenation in a patient with BOS [62]. There are other therapies under investigation, including alemtuzumab, an anti-CD 52 antibody, which significantly improved the histological grade of BOS in 7 of 10 patients but had no impact on pulmonary function in an open label study [63].",

In the late 1990's, two studies demonstrated the stabilization of airway obstruction due to BOS with extracorporeal photopheresis in 4/5 patients [70] and 5/8 patients [71], respectively, without complications occurring from the procedure. In fact, Salerno et al [71] reported 2 patients having histologic reversal of rejection. Functional stabilization was observed in 3/5 patients with BOS that was accompanied by a slight increase or stabilization of the number of peripheral blood CD4(+)CD25(high) cells with in vitro features of Treg cells while the other 2 non-responsive patients with BOS showed a decline in the peripheral Treg subset [72]. An animal study further confirmed that CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells appears to play a key role in the immunomodulatory effects of extracorporeal photopheresis [73]. Over a 10-year period, one study reported that 12 patients with BOS treated with extracorporeal photopheresis had significant improvement in the decline in FEV1, 112 mL/month before therapy and 12 mL/month after 12 cycles of therapy (P = 0.011) [74]. The effect of extracorporeal photopheresis on absolute FEV1 on the group of 12 patients was not significant and the therapy was tolerated [74].",

Jain et al [77] demonstrated that azithromycin treatment initiated before the development of BOS stage 2 was independently associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death. Thus, clinicians should be closely monitoring lung transplant recipients, carefully monitoring for early chronic rejection. Spirometry should be performed routinely on lung transplant recipients, looking for any changes in the FEV1 and FEF25-75% measurements based on the ISHLT classification system (Table 1). The use of HRCT imaging with inspiratory and expiratory views of the chest to assess for airtrapping may be helpful based on initial studies [18,78], but further research is less conclusive regarding its value [79-81]. Currently, radiographic imaging remains supportive in the diagnostic evaluation and management of BOS. Figure 2 demonstrates the usefulness of HRCT imaging in diagnosing BOS in a 55 year-old patient who underwent right single lung transplantation in 1992 for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency but suddenly developed a 25% reduction in FEV1 3 years after undergoing single left lung transplantation for BOS. The right allograft clearly had significant bronchiectasis due to long-standing BOS, but the more recent allograft on the left side had signs of bronchiectasis with airtrapping, further supporting the diagnosis of BOS in that allograft.",

However, lung retransplantation remains very controversial due to limited organ availability and lower survival rates as compared to initial transplants. In 1995, Novick et al [86] reviewed the records of 72 patients who underwent retransplantation for BOS at 26 North American and European centers. In this cohort, the actuarial survival rates were 71% at 1 month, 43% at 1 year, and 35% at 2 years [86]. For the 90-day postoperative survivors, 63% were alive 2 years after retransplantation [86]. Further study in larger cohorts of 139 retransplant recipients in 1995 and 230 retransplant recipients in 1998 demonstrated very similar survival statistics [87,88]. Although survival rates for lung retransplantation were lower than survival rates for initial transplants, lung retransplantation continued to be performed in recipients who developed BOS. More recently, survival rates after lung retransplantation have improved [89-94]. A retrospective cohort study of 205 patients who underwent lung retransplantation between January 2001 and May 2006 in the United States demonstrated a 1-year survival of 62%, 3-year survival of 49%, and 5-year survival of 45% [89]. These authors did not assess the outcomes of patients undergoing retransplantation specifically for BOS, but there was definite improvement in outcomes for all patients after lung retransplantation in the modern era. Moreover, there have been smaller studies that have addressed the survival of lung retransplantation for BOS in adult patients; Table 3 outlines these research studies published since 2000. These 5 recent studies report 1-year and 5-year survival rates at 60-75% and 44-62%, respectively in comparison to the current unadjusted survival rates for initial transplants of 79% at 1 year and 52% at 5 years as published by Christie et al [4].",

In the current lung allocation score era of lung transplantation, recipients have significantly fewer BOS-free days after 3-year follow-up [95]. Further research is needed to better define the pathophysiologic mechanisms in BOS in order to either prevent or delay onset of the disorder. The therapies available for BOS currently are very limited and serve only to slow the decline in pulmonary function. Lung retransplantation continues to be controversial, but survival rates have improved in patients with BOS over the past decade and thus should be considered as a treatment option in this patient population.",
