However, the burden of the disease falls disproportionately on sub\u2010Saharan Africa, which accounts for more than 70% of global cases.

GRFT has been expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli (Giomarelli et al., 2006) and in Nicotiana benthamiana (O'Keefe et al., 2009) despite concerns that the production of recombinant lectins in plants might interfere with signalling processes and plant development (Lotter\u2010Stark et al., 2012). The yield of recombinant GRFT in E. coli (ECGRFT) was 819 mg per litre of culture medium but 33% of the protein accumulated as inclusion bodies and was therefore misfolded and nonfunctional (Giomarelli et al., 2006). In contrast, the transient expression of GRFT in N. benthamiana using a vector based on tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) resulted in the production of up to 1 g of soluble GRFT per kg of fresh leaf weight (O'Keefe et al., 2009). Even so, the transient expression of microbicides in leafy crops has several drawbacks, including the need to process the tissue immediately after harvest to prevent protein degradation, and the need for complete purification due to the presence of toxic metabolites in tobacco and endotoxins produced by the infiltrating bacteria (Arfi et al., 2015).",

We therefore generated transgenic rice plants expressing GRFT in the endosperm and tested both the pure protein and crude extracts for their HIV\u2010specific binding activity and ability to neutralize HIV in vitro. Our studies were complemented with a griffithsin\u2010specific freedom\u2010to\u2010operate (FTO) analysis and a preliminary techno\u2010economic evaluation, which are essential first steps towards product development and commercialization.",

The presence of OSGRFT was confirmed by immunoblotting and detection using a primary rabbit anti\u2010GRFT polyclonal antiserum (Figure 2b). This revealed an intense band at 14.6 kDa, the correct size for His6\u2010tagged GRFT, and another at 16\u201317 kDa probably representing the incomplete removal of the rice \u03b1\u2010amylase (RAmy3D) signal peptide which is 25 residues in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 2.6 kDa. Alternatively, the additional band may reflect O\u2010linked glycosylation at one of the multiple serine or threonine residues of GRFT. No degradation products were present, suggesting the protein remained stable in the rice endosperm tissue (Figure 2b).",

Furthermore, crude endosperm extracts containing OSGRFT bound to gp120 in a concentration\u2010dependent manner, with binding behaviour nearly identical to that of ECGRFT.

Infectivity assays confirmed the potent antiviral activity of crude extracts containing OSGRFT. Crude extracts of wild\u2010type rice endosperm also showed a low level of viral inhibition, perhaps due to the presence of a protein/polysaccharide milieu that delays contact between the virus and the target cells (Figure 6a).

Furthermore, rice has GRAS status and has been developed as a production platform for proteins that can be administered in minimally processed seed, such as oral vaccines and prophylactics (An et al., 2013; He et al., 2011; Ning et al., 2008; Vamvaka et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012), whereas proteins transiently expressed in tobacco must be purified to remove toxic metabolites (Obembe et al., 2011) and the bacterial endotoxins produced during agroinfiltration (Arfi et al., 2015).",

This is the first time that GRFT has been expressed in stably transformed plants and the first time it has been expressed in cereal seeds. Line 6 was selected for additional experiments because T1 seeds produced the highest yields of OSGRFT (301 \u03bcg/g dry seed weight). GRFT has been produced at higher levels by transient expression in N. benthamiana (1 mg/g after 12 days), but this was reduced to 300 \u03bcg/g after purification, which is only slightly higher than our yields of pure protein (223 \u03bcg/g dry seed weight) and similar to the yield of 350 \u03bcg/g reported for another lectin (CV\u2010N) produced in transgenic soybean (O\u1fbdKeefe et al., 2015). It is also likely that our T1 yields can be improved further by breeding line 6 to homozygosity, as demonstrated for other recombinant proteins produced in cereal seeds (Hood et al., 2012). For example, the monoclonal antibody 2G12 was expressed in rice seeds with a yield of 37 \u03bcg/g in the T1 generation but this increased to 46 \u03bcg/g in the T3 generation after two rounds of self\u2010pollination (Vamvaka et al., 2015).

Mori et al. (2005) purified the native GRFT from Griffithsia spp. by ammonium sulphate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, anion\u2010exchange chromatography, reversed\u2010phase chromatography and size exclusion chromatography to yield a homogeneous, highly pure and biologically active protein. We found that ammonium sulphate precipitation did not work for OSGRFT even when combined with ethanol precipitation. However, protein extraction using a phosphate buffer combined with IMAC achieved 74% recovery and 80% purity. Giomarelli et al. (2006) purified soluble ECGRFT by IMAC using Ni\u2010NTA resin and the dialysed protein was then applied to a TALON IMAC resin before stepwise elution using two buffers containing different amounts of imidazole, achieving 53% recovery. Ishag et al. (2013) used IMAC followed by elution in a buffer containing 250 mm imidazole before further purification by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column. The resulting purified protein contained both the monomeric and dimeric forms of GRFT but the final purity and recovery were not reported. Finally, Xue et al. (2013) used a nickel\u2010chelating column and eluted GRFT with 500 mm imidazole, refolding the protein by dropwise addition to a low\u2010salt refolding buffer before final purification using C4 reversed\u2010phase chromatography, but again no data were reported for purity and recovery. When GRFT was produced in N. benthamiana, the first purification step involved the removal of the TMV vector coat protein by filtration through a ceramic membrane, followed by ion\u2010exchange chromatography over SP\u2010Sepharose resin, ultrafiltration/diafiltration to concentrate the protein and elution with 100 mm NaCl, achieving >99.8% purity albeit with only 30% recovery as stated above (O'Keefe et al., 2009). We used nondenaturing conditions to prepare the protein extract thus keeping GRFT in its native confirmation to avoid the need for a refolding step. The protein was captured on a Profinity IMAC column and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. This is the first one\u2010step purification procedure reported for GRFT, and although the purity was lower than that reported by O'Keefe et al. (2009), the use of rice as a production platform means that stringent purity is unnecessary because the plant matrix is safe for mucosal applications (Ning et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2008). The large\u2010scale production and purification of GRFT could be facilitated by exploiting its stability, because it remains soluble and functional at temperatures up to ~80 \u00b0C, whereas most plant host cell proteins precipitate below this temperature (Moulaei et al., 2010; Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska et al., 2007b). Fuqua et al. (2015) demonstrated that the purity of GRFT extracts can increase by 30%\u201340% at temperatures exceeding 50 \u00b0C, and using this approach, they achieved a recovery rate of 88 \u00b1 5% compared to the initial extract.",

It is possible that GRFT undergoes partial post\u2010translational modification and is therefore present in two forms, but the GRFT sequence does not contain an N\u2010glycan acceptor site so only O\u2010linked glycans would account for the difference in mobility (2\u20133 kDa).

For example, a recombinant fungal phytase was directed to the PSVs in rice and wheat, and the HIV\u2010neutralizing antibody 2G12 was deposited in the PSVs of maize and rice (Arcalis et al., 2004; Drakakaki et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2013; Vamvaka et al., 2015). Furthermore, Drakakaki et al.

In contrast, we found that GRFT was localized almost exclusively in the PSVs and could easily be extracted with PBS even though most of the surrounding endogenous seed storage proteins are not soluble under these conditions. The ability of GRFT to retain its independent solubility suggests that it does not interact with the storage proteins, for example by the formation of disulphide bonds (Peters et al., 2013).",

GRFT interacts with a number of viruses, but shows particular potency against HIV because it can bind to multiple sites on gp120 (Giomarelli et al., 2006). We therefore compared the biological activity of purified OSGRFT, crude extracts containing OSGRFT and purified ECGRFT, by testing their ability to bind gp120\u2010IIIB in vitro. We found that OSGRFT and ECGRFT bound to gp120 with near identical binding characteristics and that the crude extracts showed similar binding activity to the pure proteins once the concentration of GRFT in the extracts was taken into account. Similarly, O'Keefe et al.

Although we have demonstrated that rice is potentially a cost\u2010effective production platform for GRFT, the FTO analysis revealed a possibility of patent infringement based on the GRFT sequence. However, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH), which holds the most pertinent GRFT patents (Boyd et al., 2011, 2011; O'Keefe et al., 2011), has made the conscientious decision not to patent GRFT\u2010related technologies in developing countries so as to allow these countries, many of them those most affected by the HIV epidemic, to produce GRFT for use by their populations without a licence.
