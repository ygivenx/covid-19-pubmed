Mouse IgG was detected on the surface of both male and female intact adult worms using a laser confocal microscopy (Fig. 1a). The fluorescence visualized using fluorescence microscopy was more intense on the surface of male worms compared with that of females (Fig. 1b). Indeed, imaging of frozen sections using the laser confocal microscopy showed that the fluorescence signals were located on the outermost layer of the blood fluke (Fig. 1c). Additionally, mouse IgM was also observed on the parasite surface (Fig. 2a), and the adsorption of human IgG, IgM and IgE on the parasite surface was clearly observed (Fig. 2b\u2013d). No cross reactivity was observed with the secondary fluorescence-labeled antibodies (data not shown).",

The pathology of schistosomiasis has been mainly attributed to constant egg deposition in the liver of infected individuals. Thus, elimination of the parasites in the veins is the optimal way to cure the disease. It has been known that adult worms can thrive in the mesenteric or vesicular veins for decades. However, although surface masking and antigenic variation have been implicated, the mechanism is unclear. In this study, we used immunofluorescence to illuminate the surface of worms processing affinity for both mouse and human immunoglobulins. Then, we affinity-purified the proteins with host non-immune immunoglobulins18. Of the 437 schistosomal proteins identified, 243 bound to human IgG, 210 to human IgM, and 134 to human IgE; most of the proteins showed affinity for both IgG and IgM, while fewer showed affinity for IgE (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, most of the proteins could be categorized based on sequence features, including EF-hand motif, immunoglobulin motif, Ca2+ binding motif, annexin superfamily, immunophilin, and complement binding motif, suggesting common properties of immunoglobulin binding among the proteins identified. Even though a number of proteins were predicted to be surface-exposed proteins, some of them might be exposed after the washing in the citrate buffer. For example, Sj22.6 was detected in the apical cytoplasm of the tegument of male and female worms of S. japonicum by immunofluorescence in an earlier report19. Thus further investigation are needed to definitively localize the proteins with uncharacterized features.",

The binding of these proteins with host immunoglobulins was confirmed using both an ELISA assay and a pull-down approach. Compared with ELISA assays, pull-down assays require higher affinity between the ligand and receptor due to the high stringency of particle precipitation and the associated washing steps. All of the selected proteins showed a high affinity for the IgGs of both humans and domestic animals and variable but reduced affinity for IgM, IgE and IgA (Fig. 5 and Table 3). Previous studies on the antigen paramyosin of S. mansoni611121314 and Sjc2315 suggested that these proteins only adhere to the Fc domain of Ig; in agreement with this result, we found that all of the tested recombinant proteins bound the Fc domain except Sj31, which showed a slight affinity for the Fab domain (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 3). It is likely that one of mechanisms schistosomal parasites escape host recognition is through binding to the Fc domain of immunoglobulins. One consequence of this Fc domain binding is that the reaction of complement activation and fixation is paralyzed due to the reduced availability of the paratope-epitope interaction of the Fab domain with the antigen, resulting in the unavailability of the complement binding domain. Furthermore, the complement receptor protein identified in the parasite (C1qBP) exhibited higher affinity for human IgG than for complement C1q, strongly suggesting that the parasite utilized non-immune Ig to block complement activation.",

For example, Sjc23, a member of the tetraspanin protein family, is a 23 kDa surface-exposed protein of S. japonicum that has been regarded as a potential candidate for a schistosomiasis vaccine. However, in our previous study we found that this protein elicited rapid humoral responses mediated by the IgG2a subclass after infection and did not provide protection against challenge with cercariae16. It was further determined that Sjc23 could bind to human non-immune IgG through the interaction of a 9-amino acid motif (-KIQTSFHCC-) with the Fc domain of human IgG15. This binding may be responsible for the rapid but biased immune response after immunization with the recombinant Sjc23 protein or parasite infection16. Hence, it was demonstrated that Sjc23 is a schistosomal molecule with IgG-binding properties that facilitates parasite immune regulation in a manner similar to that of paramyosin. In the current study, Sjc23 and paramyosin were enriched and identified, validating the coverage and veracity of the affinity-based purification approach.",

Members of the IgSF exhibit characteristic immunoglobulin-like folding, which is defined by two opposing antiparallel \u03b2-sheets connected in a unique manner202122. Some of the secreted or cell surface-localized members of the IgSF have been suggested to play central roles in regulating the adaptive and innate immune responses. An essential activity of the ectodomains of these proteins is the specific recognition of diverse cognate ligands23. For example, many members of the IgSF, including Fc\u03b3RIIB, PIR-B, BTLA, PD-1 and KIR, have been defined as inhibitory receptors that mediate immunosuppression via binding to their specific ligands. Previous studies have shown that viruses and other pathogens that engage IgSF receptors contribute to the selection of humoral mediators of adaptive immunity212223. However, the function of the schistosomal IgSF members and their interaction with the mammalian host immune system is still not understood. Here, the finding that this family of proteins selectively recognize and bind to host immunoglobulins, which are their homologous proteins, which suggests that they may lead to suppressive immunoreaction, and contribute to the inhibition of anti-schistosoma immunity as observed in other pathogens such as adenovirus, coronavirus, and reovirus20.",

It has been reported that the schistosomula stages of S. mansoni release an elastase-like serine protease that degrades IgE in both humans and rodents but not IgG in humans37. Proteases secreted by T. cruzi trypomastigotes can enzymolyze the Fc fragment of normal IgG, suggesting that the FcRs inhibit the cytotoxic effects of the classical pathway3839. Furthermore, a fraction (PSA-Fc+) isolated from the suckers and tegument of E. granulosus protoscoleces was described to possess proteolytic activity specific for human IgG1 and IgG3 through Fc binding40. In the present study, we identified six cathepsins in S. japonicum that exhibited an affinity for human Igs. Specifically, Sj31, a cathepsin B-like cysteine proteinase, was confirmed to possess an affinity for human, porcine, and bovine IgG and human IgD.

Similar to paramyosin, Tpm is aconstitutive protein of the muscular tissue in schistosomes and is located in the worm epidermis44. Due to the numbers of tropomyosin isoforms in schistosomes, it is likely that Tpm induces a range of responses in the host. In a recent report analyzing SmTpm, 12 of 20 predicted splice variants from the four SmTpm genes of S. mansoni were detected, and four variants of TpmII (TpmII.4, 8, 3 and 7) were analyzed. The authors concluded that TpmII.3 interacted with IgE and that TpmII.7 interacted with IgG445. Here, we identified a variant of SjTpm that interacted with human, porcine and bovine IgG, and human IgM. Another study by our laboratory identified 25 predicted splice variants from the five SjTpm genes46; however, identifying their target components and understanding their association with the immune response requires further studies.",

This system helps or \u201ccomplements\u201d the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens from an organism. C1q is a glycoprotein that belongs to the collectin family and has the largest molecular weight among all complement molecules. C1q is the first component of the classical pathway of complement activation. The globular head of C1q exclusively binds to the CH2 domain of IgG molecules or to the CH3 domain of IgM to alter its conformation, leading to activation of the C1r and C1s proteases and the classical complement pathway. However, this activation occurs only after immunoglobulin binding in the form of immune complexes. Here, we verified that C1qBP could bind to both C1q and human IgG, with a stronger affinity for the latter than for the former. Moreover, human IgG could efficiently block the binding of C1q to C1qBP, potentially inhibiting complement activation and the classical complement pathway. Our real-time PCR results showed that C1qBP was expressed during all developmental stages of the parasite and was most abundant during the cercaria stage, implying that C1qBP may play a key role in protecting the juvenile parasites from immune attacks in the early period after invasion and maintaining this effect during other parasitic stages.",
