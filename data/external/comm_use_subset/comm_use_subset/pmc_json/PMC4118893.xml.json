To address these controversies, Wong et al. [4] conducted a spatiotemporal analysis during an influenza outbreak in a hospital ward and reported that infections spread along the direction of airflow from the index case. Furthermore, Lindsley et al. [5] and Blachere et al. [6] detected the airborne virus in healthcare facilities treating influenza patients. Thus, it is important to assess airborne transmission to discern the amount of virus released into environmental air through coughing.",

The filter to trap the bio-particles was cooled immediately after collection until it was transported to the laboratory where it was then dissolved in 10 mL of Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 50 U of penicillin and 50 \u00b5g/mL of streptomycin at 37\u00b0C. The samples were aliquoted and then assessed using a plaque assay, whereas the remaining samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until quantification of the viral gene copy number. Throat swabs were collected from the pharyngeal walls exclusively by one of the investigators (E.H.) to avoid technical variation in sampling techniques by multiple collectors using cotton swabs. Then, the swabs were vigorously washed in MEM transport medium supplemented with 50 U of penicillin and 50 \u00b5g/mL of streptomycin.

The generated viral mist was drawn directly into the gelatin filter membrane apparently by robust pumping of the sampler, which was confirmed against a black paper background and was visible by the naked eye. A similar experiment was repeated using a hollow paper tube (length, 10 cm; inner diameter, 8 cm) to guide the mist to the membrane, of which the outer and inner surfaces were coated with aluminum foil to prevent static charge (Figure 2 A). This tube was placed to minimize the possibility that the collection of mist by the membrane might be drastically reduced by the diffusion of the mist, and the result was compared with that of an experiment conducted without the use of a tube. Then, the cone-shaped device employed for cough collection was attached, the nebulizer was placed at the entrance of the device, and the viral mist collection experiments were repeated. (Figure 2 B). We observed that the generated mist was smoothly sucked into the cone-shaped device. After mist collection, the gelatin membrane was dissolved in MEM and the viral M1 gene copy-number was quantified using qRT-PCR. The results showed that the recovery rates of the viruses between the controls with and without the tube were almost equal and the results of the system employing the cone-shaped device were approximately 58% of the controls. We obtained similar results when less concentrated viral fluid (104 PFU/mL) was atomized (Table 1).",

Using this detection limit as a parameter, the cases were deemed as either positive or negative for the presence of influenza virus. Of the 23 (41%) cases determined as positive, and the viral load varied widely from 10 to 2240 copies/cough.

We were also interested in the results of patients with a shorter duration of treatment (1.5\u20134.5 h) from the perspective of whether viral release from the respiratory tract by coughing could be inhibited by drug administration after the viral budding process concluded. This point of view was based on the mechanisms of the action of NA inhibitor drugs, as the timing of this action is considered important at the moment of viral release at viral budding sites to inhibit release by the inactivation of the viral NA enzyme. Thus, we wished to determine whether there was another mechanism by which the drugs enhanced rebinding of the virus to the cell surface, which had already been released from the cell surface, and thus reduce the viral load of the cough or not. We, therefore, added the results of 10 such cases to the same graph and found that the virus detection rate of these cases (5/10, 50%) was also similar to those of both untreated and sufficiently treated cases (both p = 1.00, Fisher's exact test), as was the viral load (p = 0.33 and 0.65, Mann\u2013Whitney U test, respectively).

The viral loads of vaccinated cases were lower than those of the unvaccinated cases (Figure 5 A).

We thought that it would be important to determine whether the symptom of cough impacted that actual viral loads in a cough; therefore, we considered coughing by non-symptomatic patients, by e.g., due to allergy, physiological stimulations, or causes other than influenza infection. Viral loads in the cough samples collected by voluntary coughing were compared between influenza cases with and without a symptom of coughing using throat swab samples as control (Figure 6). The viral loads in the throat swabs were calculated from the viral load of the transport medium. The approximate quantity of the collected swab fluid was estimated by the increase of the weight of the cotton swab used for sample collection, which was based on the tentative assumption that the specific gravity of the sample was 1.0 and the sample absorbed in the cotton swab was almost completely washed out into the transport medium. The viral load of the cough in patients with the symptom of cough was higher than for those without it (median  = 53.7 and 38.3, respectively). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.33, Mann\u2013Whitney U test), as was seen with throat swab (median  = 5644 and 6654, respectively; p = 0.79, Mann\u2013Whitney U test). However, interestingly, several patients in the symptomatic group had higher viral loads than in the non-symptomatic group. In addition, we also found that the cases with the highest viral loads in the throat swab (plot numbers 1 and 2) had undetectable levels of viruses in the cough samples; thus, the highest viral load in a cough sample (plot numbers 4\u20136) did not necessarily correspond with the highest viral load in a throat swab (Figure 6). Hence, our results suggest that the viral load in the cough samples, from at least those cases, might have been affected by the status of the symptom of cough, and do not necessarily directly reflect the status of viral load on the pharyngeal wall.",

However, we noticed a reflection flow in some actual cases. A stronger cough flow might collide against the inside wall, filter membrane, and/or internal air mass of the device and rebound, or flushed out the internal air mass. However, the result of our preliminary experiments showed that the spill over caused by the outward flow might not affect the result. When a volunteer smoker coughed into the device once in a chamber after one breath of smoking, the smoke particle count adjacent to the outer surface of the device was about 20-fold lower with pumping than without (data not shown). The levels of viral genes measured from coughs in many patients by our system were similar to those measured using the methods of Lindsley et al., who perfectly collected cough samples by asking the patients to blow into a spirometer [8]\n, which may offer supporting evidence to validate the collection rate of our system.",

We observed that the viruses did not become inactivated if the plaque titration was conducted within a short time after being trapped in the membrane, but they may become inactivated after an extended period with varying degrees of inactivation speed depending on the environmental temperature and humidity (data not shown).
