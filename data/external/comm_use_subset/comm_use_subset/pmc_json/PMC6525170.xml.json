            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally1,2. In 2015, acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) resulted in an estimated 33.1 million disease episodes, 3.2 million hospitalisations and 118,200 deaths in children younger than the age of 5 years3. A common complication of respiratory virus infection is secondary bacterial infection; viruses such as influenza, RSV and parainfluenza often predispose the host to secondary respiratory disease caused by pathobionts, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus4\u20138, leading to serious, potentially life-threatening sequelae9. Secondary bacterial complications are thought to have been the major cause of the fatalities that occurred in the wake of the major influenza pandemics of the 20th and early 21st century8,10,11. In the case of RSV, there is a strong link between virus infection and secondary bacterial infections, particularly otitis media caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae12\u201314. Although the molecular and cellular basis for this co-pathogenesis is not fully understood, evidence from in vitro studies suggests that RSV infection of respiratory epithelial cell lines, such as HEp-2 and A549 facilitates increased adhesion of bacteria such as S. pneumoniae and H influenzae15\u201318, and suggests that RSV infection in vivo increases the capacity of these bacteria to colonise the airway. These observations are supported by results from clinical studies which show that the upper airway microbiota of children with RSV infection is significantly enriched for H. influenzae and Streptococcus19,20. The host response to RSV infection is characterised by the recruitment of innate immune cells21 and the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17A and other soluble mediators22. To date, no studies have examined whether the immune response triggered by replication of RSV in the airway has simultaneous antibacterial activity, aimed at controlling increased bacterial colonisation resulting from viral infection. Here we report the simultaneous analysis of the upper airway proteomes and microbiota of infants and children with and without RSV infection to determine whether elements of the innate immune response to RSV infection in the human airway has incidental antibacterial activity. Using shotgun proteomics, we find that the local airway response that followed RSV infection is characterised by a strong neutrophil response, which has direct antibacterial properties.",

The top 10 taxa in the airway microbiome by median proportional abundance were Streptococcus, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Prevotella, Neisseria, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Moraxella, and Leptotrichia (Fig. 1a). Streptococcus was the most abundant taxon with a median proportional abundance of ~40% (Supplementary Fig. 1). Simultaneous bacterial metaproteome analysis using mass spectrometry showed a similar profile of microbial diversity and was equally dominated by Streptococcal proteins (Fig. 1b). Most of the bacterial proteins in the metaproteome were ribosomal proteins, including 50S and 30S proteins as well proteins involved in energy metabolism, such as pyruvate oxidase and enolase. Further analysis of the genomic microbiota data was undertaken to determine whether the airway replication of RSV had an effect on the most abundant bacterial taxon (Streptococcus). Changes in Streptococcus abundance during and after RSV infection were calculated in a subset of RSV-infected children (n = 10) for whom nasal samples were collected at admission (acute samples) and ~1 month later (convalescent samples). For 70% of these children (7/10), the airway abundance of Streptococcus during acute infection was higher than that at convalescence, while for three children (3/10), Streptococcus abundance at convalescence was either not different or had increased, relative to the acute infection time point (Fig. 1c).",

Of the 1875 host proteins that were quantified in the upper airway, the mean expression levels of 123 proteins were significantly different between the two groups of children (Supplementary data 2). Among these, 73 proteins were expressed at significantly higher levels in children with RSV infection while the remainder were higher among those without RSV infection (Fig. 2a). Gene ontology biological process (GOBP)-based enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed proteins showed that the neutrophil degranulation pathway (GOBP ID: 0043312, combined enrichment score = 401.9) was the most significantly enriched biological process among RSV-infected children (adjusted Fishers exact test P = 9.5 \u00d7 10\u221231, Fig. 2b). Other pathways such as proteolysis were also significantly enriched in the airways of RSV-infected children but their respective enrichment scores were much lower than the neutrophil degranulation pathway (combined enrichment scores of \u2264 35.1) (Fig. 2b). The neutrophil degranulation pathway comprised 33 proteins\u2014including bactericidal proteins that are typically localised within neutrophil granules, such as MPO, AZU1, BPI, LCN2, and others (Fig. 2d). In addition to neutrophil granule proteins, we also observed elevated expression of other potent antibacterial proteins in RSV-infected children; the mean expression levels of eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) and Ras-related protein (RAP1B) were significantly higher in RSV-infected children than in RSV-negative controls (Fig. 2d). Among children without RSV infection, SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membrane, signal sequence recognition (GOBP ID: 0006617, adjusted Fishers exact test P = 1.02 \u00d7 10\u22128, Fig. 2c) was the most significantly enriched pathway.",

We also used flow cytometry to assess the functional activity of these cells in RSV-positive and RSV-negative children. In RSV-infected children, neutrophils occurred at a median frequency of 12% while in RSV-negative children, neutrophils comprised 8% of cells in the upper airway (Fig. 4g). Although the mean frequency of airway-resident neutrophils in RSV-positive children was higher than that of RSV-negative children, this difference was not statistically significant. Next, using an ex-vivo phagocytosis assay, we assessed the ability of airway-resident neutrophils from RSV-positive and RSV-negative bacteria to ingest and kill bacteria. In this assay, we used a representative bacteria species (E. coli) that was labelled with a tag (pHrodo) whose fluorescence was activated only upon ingestion and localisation of the bacteria into a phagosome, thereby allowing for a quantitative assessment of phagocytic activity through flow cytometry (see examples in Fig. 4d, f). Using this assay we compared the phagocytic capacity of airway neutrophils obtained from RSV-positive and RSV-negative children. Although not statistically significant, a greater proportion of airway neutrophils obtained from RSV-positive children exhibited phagocytic activity against E. coli (median 18%) compared to RSV-negative children (median 16%).",

Since one of the central features of severe RSV pneumonia is reduced blood oxygen saturation resulting from occlusion of small airways with necrotic, virus-infected cells as well as infiltrating immune cells. We therefore examined the effect of the increased expression of neutrophil granule proteins on blood oxygen saturation. Children were dichotomised into two groups (high and low neutrophil granule expressers) based on the median expression level of different proteins. Children whose protein expression level was above the median expression (of the full study population) were classified as high expressers while those who were below the median were classified as low expressers (Fig. 5). We then compared oxygen saturation levels between these two groups. For all neutrophil granule proteins that were analysed (ITGAM, BPI, LCN2, MGAM, ITGB2, AZU1, ANPEP, MMP9 and MPO), children with low levels of airway neutrophil granule expression had significantly higher blood oxygen saturation levels compared to children in the high-expression group (Fig. 5a). For comparison, we also dichotomised the expression levels of two housekeeping proteins\u2014beta-actin (ACTB) and \u03b2-2-microglobulin (B2M)\u2014using the median.

We therefore hypothesised that the host response to RSV is partly directed at controlling increased levels of Streptococcus. We undertook comprehensive analysis of the airway microbiota and proteomes of children with RSV as well as RSV-negative controls, in order to identify features of the post-infection innate immune response that have incidental antibacterial effects. We found that the upper airways of children in the study was dominated by a highly diverse population of commensal bacteria for which a wide range of bacterial proteins could be detected in the airway metaproteome. We also found evidence that infection with RSV is associated with increased Streptococcal colonisation. In a subset analysis of children who were sampled both during acute disease and at convalescence, approximately one month later, we found that the airway abundance of Streptococcus was greater at the time of RSV infection compared with the convalescent time point when children had cleared the infection. These results agree with previous clinical studies that have shown that children with RSV infections have a higher abundance of Streptococci in their airway secretions19, and supports the idea that RSV-infection in the human airway, enhances Streptococcal colonisation.",

            "text": "Our results showed that following an RSV infection there was a significant increase in the expression levels of a large number of proteins related to innate immunity. Due to the fact that RSV replication and the RSV-mediated increase in bacterial colonisation occur simultaneously, it was not possible to establish which elements of this response were directly attributable to the virus and which ones were triggered by the increased bacterial load. Since the innate host response to infection is highly co-ordinated, and the proteins that were highly expressed in RSV-positive children are likely to represent functionally related proteins that are co-regulated in order to initiate an effector response, we used pathway enrichment analysis to identify the innate immune pathways that were associated with the highly expressed proteins. In RSV-infected children, we found a significant enrichment of the neutrophil degranulation pathway, characterised by the increased expression of neutrophil effector proteins, such as MPO, AZU1 and ELANE which have been shown in previous work to be associated with RSV infection23\u201325. In agreement with previous studies26,27, we found that neutrophils could be detected at relatively high frequencies in the upper airway samples of children with respiratory infections, thereby suggesting that the local innate response to RSV infection in the airway is associated with an influx of neutrophils and their subsequent degranulation. Neutrophils are specialised innate phagocytic cells that are densely packed with granules containing hundreds of proteins with broad antibacterial action28. These granules can be broadly classified into three subsets29: primary (or azurophil) granules (characterised by expression of MPO, BPI and ELANE), secondary (or specific) granules (characterised by LCN2 expression) and tertiary (or gelatinase) granules (identified by expression of MMP9). In this study, we identified proteins belonging to all three subsets in the upper airway secretions of study participants and all were expressed at significantly higher levels in RSV-infected children compared to RSV-negative controls. Previous studies have provided compelling evidence of the direct antibacterial action of neutrophil granule proteins and have highlighted their central role in innate immune defence against bacteria. For example, MPO is a potent bactericidal protein, which in the presence of a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) source\u2014such as S. pneumoniae30\u2014selectively binds to bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, causing their rapid killing31. BPI on the other hand exhibits independent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli32,33 and is also capable of neutralising bacterial endotoxin34, while ELANE mediates cleavage of virulence factors from bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigella35. In addition to neutrophil granule proteins, we found increased expression of bactericidal proteins from other innate immune cell populations, such as the eosinophilic peroxidase EPX, which rapidly kills bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis36. These observations suggested that the neutrophil response that follows an RSV airway infection might have significant antibacterial activity due to the incidental overexpression of these bactericidal proteins. To test this hypothesis, we compared the relative bacterial inhibition activity in airway samples obtained from RSV-positive and RSV-negative children, as well as a subset of RSV-infected infants from whom acute and convalescent samples were available. We found that the airway secretions from children infected with RSV had significantly higher bacterial inhibition activity compared with those from RSV-negative children. Additionally, bacterial inhibition activity at the acute stage of RSV infection, was significantly greater than during convalescence. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the expression levels of neutrophil granule proteins and inhibition of pneumococcal growth in the in vitro bacterial inhibition assay. We also found that an increase in bacterial inhibition activity was associated with changes in the composition of the upper airway microbiota, characterised by a reduction in the airway abundance of Streptococcus. Comparative analysis of the relative levels of anti-pneumococcus IgG in RSV-positive and RSV-negative children showed that the difference in bacterial inhibition activity could not be explained by a differential abundance of these antibodies, since antibody levels against two different pneumococcal antigens were not significantly different. Taken together these observations suggest that the recruitment and degranulation of airway neutrophils in following an RSV infection is associated with the increased expression of bactericidal proteins whose antibacterial action contributes to the regulation of commensal bacteria in the upper respiratory tract. Due to the fact that the virus-mediated increase in bacterial load occurs concurrently with the airway replication of RSV, it was not possible to conclusively establish whether the antibacterial activity that we observed in RSV-infected children was as a result of virus infection, increased bacterial load or both. Despite the fact that nasal secretions from RSV-infected children had significantly greater antibacterial activity compared to RSV-negative controls, these children had a higher airway abundance of Streptococcus. A possible explanation for this observation is the contemporaneous nature of RSV replication and increased bacterial colonisation in the airway. Previous studies in in vitro cell culture models have shown that S. pneumoniae adheres at significantly greater levels to RSV-infected cells, compared to uninfected cells and that this increased adherence is mediated by a direct interaction between bacterial adhesins and the RSV attachment protein that is expressed on the surface of RSV-infected cells15,16,18. This suggests that the conditions in the airway at the time of acute RSV infection\u2014when virus replication is at peak\u2014favour increased bacterial colonisation and that these conditions persist for as long as the viral infection remains unresolved.",

For all the proteins that we analysed, we found that increased expression of neutrophil granule proteins in the airway was associated with reduced oxygen saturation. These observations suggest that the influx of neutrophils in the airway and their subsequent degranulation may play a substantial role in the pathology of RSV disease. Despite over 60 years of research, remarkably little is known about the cellular response to RSV in the lungs of infants. The most detailed study to date examined archived post-mortem lung tissue from suspected fatal cases of RSV bronchiolitis from the 1930s and 1940s. Lung tissue obtained from these infants was characterised by a neutrophil influx that was distributed predominantly between arterioles and airways37. Using modern systems biology tools, our results of our study align with these previous findings and highlight a potential central role of neutrophils in RSV disease pathology. It is likely that these infiltrating neutrophils occlude the small airways of young infants, leading to impaired gas exchange and manifesting clinically in reduced blood oxygen saturation and hypoxia.",

Results from RSV-positive samples were confirmed using a direct fluorescent antibody test kit (Light Diagnostics, Merc) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A standardised set of clinical and anthropometric measures were collected for all study participants including: age, respiratory rate, axillary temperature, oxygen saturation, and history of upper respiratory tract symptoms (coughing, sneezing, runny nose). To establish associations between RSV infection and the resident airway microbiota, children were stratified into two groups, RSV-positive and RSV-negative: in the RSV-positive group, only children who were positive for RSV (real-time cycle threshold values \u2264 27) and negative for all other targets on the multiplex panel were included. In the RSV-negative group, only children who were negative for all pathogens in the real-time PCR panel were included. Children with positive blood culture results were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was sought from the parents and legal guardians of all children who were sampled in this study. Ethical approval for the conduct of this study was granted by the Kenya Medical Research Institute\u2019s Scientific and ethical research unit (SERU).

The data arising from the mass-spectrometry analysis are deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium database44 (Accession number: PXD009403). Analysis of the airway metaproteome was undertaken by searching the Raw mass spectrometer files (using MaxQuant software version 1.6.0.131) against a bacterial FASTA database, which was constructed by assembling Uniprot FASTA files of individual bacteria species that had been identified by genomic microbiota analysis into a single FASTA search file. Searches for bacterial proteins were done using the Andromeda search engine45. To test whether the mean expression levels of different host airway proteins were significantly different between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children, two-sided t-tests were conducted and adjustment for multiple testing done using the false discovery rate (fdr) method. Proteins were significantly differentially expressed if their mean expression level in one group was at least 1.5-fold greater than in the alternative group. GO biological pathway enrichment analysis was done on the enrichR bioinformatic pipeline46,47. The output of this analysis was used to determine whether certain biological pathways were statistically overrepresented in the airway secretions of RSV-positive or RSV-negative children.

For the phagocytosis assay tube, 20 \u03bcl of opsonised E. coli was added to the tube (pHrodo Red E. coli BioParticles; ThermoFisher). The bacteria was initially prepared by mixing the E.coli strain with new-born calf sera followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 \u00b0C. After this step, both tubes were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 35 min. After the incubation, 20 \u03bcl of a live\u2013dead marker was added to each tube and incubated for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 \u03bcl of 1X RBC lysis buffer followed by a 5 min incubation. Cells in each tube were then spun down at 2700\u00d7g for 1 min and the supernatant discarded. Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer, after which 350 \u03bcl of FACS flow was added. Cells were then analysed immediately on a BD LSR Fortessa instrument. The following gating strategy was used to detect airway-resident neutrophils: Debris were excluded on the basis of their forward (FSC-A) and side (SSC-A) scatter characteristics (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Doublets were excluded using FSC-A versus FSC-H (Supplementary Fig. 5b) and dead cells were excluded using the live\u2013dead marker (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Cells that were double positive for CD66b and CD16 were gated as neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Cells in this gate were further analysed for their ability to phagocytose a representative bacteria (E. coli) and the results expressed in a histogram plot (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Data was analysed using FlowJo software.",

The relative abundance of the 15 highest-ranked operational taxonomic units are presented for each study participant as stacked bar charts. operational taxonomic units under the \u2018others\u2019 heading are an aggregate of bacteria that occurred at low abundances (<1%). The taxonomic identities of these low-abundance operational taxonomic units are presented in Supplementary Data 1. b The proteome of the upper airway microbiota (metaproteome) was characterised by mass spectrometric analysis using airway samples from 84 children and the results are presented in a circular bar chart. Each bar represents the mean expression level of one bacterial protein. Values on the y-axis correspond to MS protein expression levels (log10 reporter corrected intensity). Most of the bacterial operational taxonomic units that were identified in metagenomic analyses of the airway microbiota were also identified in the proteome. The highest number of protein identifications belonged to the genus Streptococcus and comprised mainly of ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in energy metabolism pathways. c The abundance of Streptococcus in the airway was compared between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children. RSV-infected children had a higher abundance of airway Streptococcus compared to RSV-negative children. d The effect of RSV infection on Streptococcal colonisation of the upper airway was characterised using a subset of 10 children from whom nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained during acute RSV infection and at convalescence, approximately one month later. Seven out of 10 children (70%) exhibited declines in the airway abundance of Streptococcus upon recovery from RSV, while for three children, convalescent-stage Streptococcus abundance was either unchanged from the acute time point or was higher.

The x-axis represents a doubling dilution of nasal samples from 1:20 to 1:40,960. The dashed horizontal red line denotes an optical density cutoff above which substantial turbidity of the culture media was observed.

The airway abundance of Streptococcus decreased with increasing bacterial inhibition activity. c Bacterial inhibition activity in nasal samples (N = 72) was correlated with the expression levels of neutrophil-granule proteins (stratified by functional subset). Representative proteins from all three subsets of neutrophil granules (azurophilic, specific and gelatinase) were positively correlated with bacterial inhibition activity (complete analysis of the correlation between bacterial inhibition activity and all the neutrophil granule proteins can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, there was no correlation between the expression levels of housekeeping proteins (ACTB, B2M and PPIA) and bacterial inhibition activity in nasal samples.

In order to characterise the clinical implications of the increased expression of neutrophil-associated proteins on disease pathology, we assessed the association between the level of expression of these proteins and a cardinal feature of RSV pathology, blood oxygen saturation. a Using proteome data obtained from all admitted children (n = 84), we stratified the expression levels of nine neutrophil granule proteins (ITGAM, BPI, LCN2, MGAM, ITGB2, AZU1, ANPEP, MMP9 and MPO) that were significantly over-expressed in RSV-infected children by the median. Children whose protein expression level was above the population median were classified as high-expressers while those below it were classified as low expressers (see legend for graphical illustration of the stratification strategy). For all proteins analysed, children in the high expression group had significantly lower blood oxygen saturation levels (measured using fingertip pulse oximetry) compared to children in the low expression group. b For comparison, we used the same median stratification strategy to dichotomise children into high and low expression groups for two housekeeping control proteins, beta-actin (ACTB) and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). For both proteins there was no statistically significant difference in blood oxygen saturation levels between high and low expressers. The dashed horizontal line indicates an oxygen saturation threshold of 90%, below which children would typically be characterised as functionally hypoxic. Statistical comparison between high and low strata was done using a two-sided Student t-test. The elements of the box and whisker plots are defined in Fig. 1.
