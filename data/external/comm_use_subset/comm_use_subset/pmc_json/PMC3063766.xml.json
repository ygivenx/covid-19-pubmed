The term encephalomyelitis refers to inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that results from the immune response to virus infection. In humans, the viruses most commonly identified as causes of viral encephalomyelitis are herpesviruses and RNA viruses in the enterovirus (e.g., polio, enterovirus 71), rhabdovirus (e.g., rabies), alphavirus (e.g., eastern equine, Venezuelan equine, and western equine encephalitis), flavivirus (e.g., West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley, and tick-borne encephalitis), and bunyavirus (e.g., La Crosse) families. Other virus families with members that can cause acute encephalitis are the paramyxoviruses (e.g., Nipah, Hendra) and arenaviruses (e.g., lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Junin). However, this is certainly not a complete list, because for most cases of human viral encephalitis the etiologic agent is not identified, even when heroic attempts are made [2].",

For instance, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 often infects neurons in the hippocampus to cause behavioral changes, while poliovirus preferentially infects motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord to cause paralysis and Japanese encephalitis virus infects basal ganglia neurons to cause symptoms similar to those of Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

            "text": "When a virus does invade the CNS, there are several routes by which infection of neurons can occur. The most common entry point is from the blood, and the level of viremia as a result of virus replication in peripheral organs often correlates with the likelihood of CNS infection. However, the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), composed of vascular endothelial cells with tight junctions in contact with the foot processes of astrocytes, inhibits direct access to the brain parenchyma and neurons. Some neurotropic viruses can replicate in cerebrovascular endothelial cells, enter with infected leukocytes, or cross directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the porous capillaries of the choroid plexus. A specialized CNS entry pathway used by several viruses, most notably HSV, varicella zoster, and rabies viruses, is by way of nerve terminals in peripheral organs. These viruses can enter the nerve and then use neural transport mechanisms to transport the infecting virions to the neuronal cell body where replication occurs [6], [7]. A variation on this theme is infection through the exposed end processes of neurons in the nasal olfactory epithelium, followed by transport of the virus to the olfactory lobe within the CNS. Intranasal infection is commonly used to initiate infection of the CNS in experimental animals, but in humans this pathway may be important only in rare cases of aerosol exposure to a neurotropic virus [8]\u2013[10].",

Few neuron-specific virus receptors have been identified (e.g., p75NTR, NCAM, and AChR for rabies; nectin for HSV) but these do not always account for neuronotropism in vivo [11]\u2013[13]. Recent studies with HSV suggest that receptors used to enter processes of peripheral neurons can be different from those used to infect neurons in the brain [12]. Therefore, the mechanisms by which encephalitic viruses target neurons to the exclusion of other cells within the CNS are poorly understood. Once within the nervous system, encephalitic viruses often follow synaptic pathways for spread to other neuronal populations. These viruses interact with motor proteins either directly or through accessory proteins to travel using both anterograde (kinesin motors) and retrograde (dynein-dynactin motors) neuronal microtubule transport systems [6].",

Many viruses cause more severe CNS disease in the young. For these infections, immature neurons support more efficient virus replication and greater virus-induced cell death than mature neurons [15]. In humans, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and La Crosse viruses cause symptomatic neurologic disease almost exclusively in children, although adults are equally susceptible to infection [16], [17]. Conversely, for unexplained reasons, neurologic disease due to West Nile virus infection occurs primarily in people over the age of 60 years [18].",

The CNS inflammatory response to virus infection consists of activation and proliferation of resident astrocytes and microglial cells and of perivascular and parenchymal infiltration of activated monocytes and lymphocytes from the blood. The mechanism(s) by which the immune response causes neuronal damage are incompletely understood, but evidence exists for production of neurotoxins and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by activated glial cells, increased levels of the excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate, and production of cytokines by activated lymphocytes [21]. The ability to control inflammation through induction of regulatory T cells and suppression of lymphocyte function by infected neurons can be an important determinant of outcome [22], [23]. In alphavirus encephalomyelitis, combined prevention of inflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity by treatment with glutamate receptor antagonists prevents paralysis and death despite continued virus replication [20].",

Alphavirus encephalitis has been most thoroughly studied, and two noncytolytic clearance mechanisms have been identified: IFN-\u03b3 and anti-viral antibody (Figure 1). However, not all types of neurons are equally responsive to virus clearance by these mechanisms. IFN-\u03b3 acts through a Jak/STAT signaling pathway to activate an antiviral response that suppresses virus replication in motor neurons without toxicity, but the relevant antiviral proteins have not been identified [24]. Antibody to the E2 viral glycoprotein present on the surface of infected neurons suppresses virus replication in all populations of neurons through a pathway that requires bivalent antibody, but does not require complement or effector cells [25], [26].",

            "text": "Because the noncytolytic process for virus clearance does not completely eliminate viral RNA from neurons, a mechanism for long-term immunologic control of virus replication is needed to prevent virus reactivation or progressive disease [27], [28]. Antibody is likely to participate in control, as well as initial clearance. Maintaining adequate levels of antibody in the CNS for continued control of virus replication requires either passage of antibody from the blood into the brain parenchyma or local production by resident antibody-secreting cells. The BBB restricts the entry of proteins from the blood into the CNS, and although this function is compromised during the acute phase of infection, it is quickly repaired. Under normal conditions, levels of antibody in the brain are sustained at 1% of plasma levels that are likely to be inadequate for long-term prevention of virus reactivation. Therefore, resident long-lived antibody-secreting cells that can continue to produce antiviral antibody for a lifetime are a feature of recovery from most CNS virus infections [29]. Long-term immune control of virus replication is not always successful, leading to recurrent or progressive neurologic disease [30]\u2013[32].",

The immune response to infection can enhance neuronal damage or can control virus replication by noncytolytic mechanisms and thus determine outcome. However, noncytolytic virus clearance results in persistence of viral nucleic acid in the CNS and thus establishes a need for long-term local immune responses to prevent reactivation of infection and progressive disease. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary for development of strategies for treating and preventing neurologic disease due to viral encephalomyelitis.",

Neurons can also survive infection and virus replication can be controlled through noncytolytic mechanisms such as local production of antiviral antibody and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3. In the latter case, viral nucleic acid persists intracellularly and long-term immune control is necessary to prevent virus reactivation.",
