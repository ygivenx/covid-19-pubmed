Yet, broad range inhibitors against viral pathogens are presently not available. Classical antiviral strategies have targeted viral structural or enzymatic motifs with high specificity and potentially low side effects. These agents are, however, prone to viral evasion, and select for resistant strains [2]. To identify novel chemical inhibitors of virus infection we performed a high-content, image-based infection screen using a library of approximately 1200 known bioactive and food and drug administration (FDA) approved small compounds for their ability to inhibit human rhinovirus (HRV) 16 infection of HeLa cells.",

Picornaviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with a capsid of 28\u201330 nm in diameter and a plus-sense, 6500\u20139000 nucleotide RNA genome. The genome encodes a single poly-protein, which is proteolytically processed during infection [3]. HRVs comprise more than one hundred known serotypes. They are the most frequent viral infections among humans and the predominant cause of the common cold [4]. HRV infections can pose severe health risks in patients with pre-existing airway conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or cystic fibrosis. This may relate to the observation that HRVs are not limited to the upper respiratory tract but also infect the lower respiratory tracts [4]. Two receptor groups have been defined for the species A and B viruses. The minor group viruses comprise twelve members utilizing low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) proteins for cell entry, and the major group uses the intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) [5]. These infections are typically pH-dependent and require the passage of viruses through acidic endosomal compartments. The recently discovered species C HRVs, which are prevalent in young children appear to use distinct but unknown attachment sites for infection [6].",

            "text": "We identified niclosamide (5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide) as an inhibitor of HRV16 infection. Niclosamide is an FDA approved anti-helmintic compound used in humans since more than forty years [10]. It has been applied as an agrochemical and in human therapy. It is well tolerated by rats with an acute oral toxicity LD50 dose larger than 5 g/kg body weight and only a marginal decrease in haemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte count occurred when male and female rats were given niclosamide at 5 g/kg/day for four weeks [11]. Niclosamide was originally developed at Farbenfabriken Bayer based on the observation that bithionol (2,2\u2032-sulfanediyl-bis(4,6-dichlorophenol)) had potent antihelmintic activity. Later work on hydroxyl-biphenyls led to the discovery of niclofolan (5,5\u2032-dichloro-2,2\u2032-dihydroxy-3,3\u2032-dinitrobiphenyl), which was modified to niclosamide. Niclosamide was introduced into the market in 1960 under the trade name Bayluscide (Bayer 73), and has been used over decades to treat gastrointestinal tapeworm infections, both in humans and animals, [for an overview, see 12]. Niclosamide is receiving renewed attention due to antiviral effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [13], anti-anthrax toxin properties [14], and anti-neoplastic activity [15]. In addition, niclosamide is a potent inducer of LC3-positive autophagosomes [16], an inhibitor of the Wnt/Frizzled pathway [17], a suppressor of the autonomous notch-signalling pathway [18], and an inhibitor of mTOR signalling [19]. In addition, it uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [20], thus slowing down cell growth.",

We tested the efficacy of niclosamide to block picornavirus infections using a panel of different enteroviruses, comprising four HRVs and coxsackieviruses (CV). We found that pH-dependent HRVs using the LDLR family (HRV1A, 2), the ICAM1 tropic major group (HRV14, 16) and the genetic groups A (HRV1A, 2 16) and B (HRV14) were sensitive to niclosamide at IC50 (the concentration with 50% of the maximal inhibition) of 0.84 to 1.4 \u00b5M (Figure 1A, B and Figure S1A in Text S1). The largely pH-independent coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR)-tropic CVB3 and CVB4 [21], and the ICAM1-tropic CVA21 were broadly unaffected at 1 \u00b5M and had IC50 values of >50 \u00b5M, 3.88 \u00b5M and 6.63 \u00b5M, respectively. This is also reflected in the therapeutic index (TI), reflecting the ratio of IC50 to CC50, the latter being the concentration with half maximal toxicity. We measured cellular energy levels using a resazurin fluorometric assay to assess the toxicity of niclosamide. Toxicity was clearly separated from antiviral efficacy against HRV1A, 2, 14, and 16 at least 10-fold (see Figure 1A and Figure S1B in Text S1). The toxicity profile closely matched the antiviral efficacy against herpes simplex virus (HSV1), which had IC50 values exceeding 10 \u00b5M.",

Niclosamide was also an effective antiviral in non-transformed cells, including WI-38 human embryonic diploid airway cells infected with HRV1A (IC50 1.3 \u00b5M, Supplementary Figure S1C in Text S1). However, it did not affect the inhibition profile when viruses were pre-treated with niclosamide at up to 400 \u00b5M at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, suggesting a non-virus target (Figure S2 in Text S1).

This suggested that niclosamide inhibited an early step of infection, presumably virus entry. These results were similar to time-course experiments with the entry inhibitor pleconaril [21], which binds to HRV capsids, or with BafA1, which neutralizes acidic endosomes by blocking the vacuolar ATPase (see Figure S3 in Text S1).",

Washing the cells with drug-free medium completely abolished the antiviral effect in both cases (Figure 2C and Figures S5B and S5C in Text S1). This suggested that the mode of inhibition did not involve high affinity drug targets or irreversible metabolic changes in the cells even when exceeding 10-fold IC50 and long-term incubation. To better define the inhibition mode of niclosamide, we performed 19\u00b0C trapping experiments. At this temperature, uptake of cargo into early endosomes is allowed, but membrane maturation and sorting from these early compartments are strongly slowed down [23]. HRV1A or HRV16 was internalized at 19\u00b0C for 1, 2 or 3 h followed by treatment with niclosamide at 37\u00b0C, or with drugs affecting capsid conversion. Here, we used the term \u2018capsid conversion\u2019 to measure cellular cues priming the virus for RNA release [5], for example virus-receptor interactions or low endosomal pH. Capsid conversion was measured by the sensitivity of HRV to pleconaril, which binds to capsid and interferes with immediate early receptor binding steps of ICAM1-tropic HRVs [24], and with endosomal conversion of (v)LDLR- tropic HRVs, [unpublished data, and 25]. Our data show that the ICAM1-tropic HRV16 readily bypassed the pleconaril block at 19\u00b0C (Figure 2D). The (v)LDLR-tropic HRV1A, in contrast, remained at least partly pleconaril-sensitive, indicating that it did not get past the 19\u00b0C step towards an acidic compartment where the pH-dependent conversion step occurs, as shown earlier for the (v)LDLR-tropic HRV2 [26]. As expected, BafA1 inhibited the infection with both HRV1A and HRV16, but not the pH-independent CVB3, when added after 1, 2 or 3 h at 19\u00b0C. Likewise, niclosamide blocked HRV1A and HRV16 but not CVB3 when added after the 19\u00b0C block. We conclude that niclosamide inhibited HRV1A and HRV16 infections after receptor binding and transport of virus to early endosomes.",

AO accumulates in vesicular compartments and emits red fluorescence, supposedly due to quenching in acidic compartments. Upon treating cells with the lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl, or the v-ATPase inhibitor BafA1 the emitted fluorescence of AO shifted from red to green, indicating de-quenching upon endosomal pH neutralization. Ratiometric live cell measurements showed that niclosamide increased the vesicular pH, similar to NH4Cl or BafA1 (Figure 3G, and Figure S6A and B in Text S1). These results were confirmed by lysotracker DND99 measurements, which showed a steep decline in fluorescence upon treatment with micromolar concentrations of niclosamide, or nanomolar concentrations of BafA1 (Figure 3B).

We found that the addition of pH 5.5 or 6 medium reversed the inhibitory effect of niclosamide on 19\u00b0C trapped viruses and promoted infection (Figure 3C). The infection stimulation was more pronounced at pH 5.5 than 6, possibly due to activation of virus penetration through the plasma membrane. Similar results were obtained with BafA1 treatment of 19\u00b0C trapped virus, where the inhibition was reversed by pH 5.5 or 6, albeit pH 5.5 was more efficient than pH 6 (data not shown). Notably, the treatment of cells with pH 5.5 buffer, which leads to acidification of the cytosol [31] did not inhibit HRV1A infection.

We found morphologic alterations of EEA1 positive structures in niclosamide-treated cells, specifically endosomal clustering in the perinuclear area (Figure 3D, E). The perinuclear intensity of LAMP1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 1) positive structures was less affected. Notably, BafA1 and to lesser extent the lysosomotropic agents NH4Cl and chloroquine had comparable phenotypic effects as niclosamide (Figure S6D and E in Text S1). Similar results were also obtained with normal diploid WI-38 cells indicating cell type independent effects (data not shown). To test if niclosamide directly affected the pH within endosomes, we measured the pH of isolated CCV by the AO red fluorescence assay. Niclosamide, BafA1 and ConcA neutralized the pH of CCV in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3F, G), notably with lower IC50 compared to cellular assays, as seen frequently in cell free assays.

The octanol/water distribution coefficient (log P) of niclosamide increases from pH 7.4 to 6 [33]. To test if there was a correlation of antiviral activity and neutralization of endosomal pH, we performed a structure-activity relationship study with a library of sixteen niclosamide-related compounds, each carrying different functional groups. As a positive control we included niclosamide from two different sources, Prestwick and SIGMA-Aldrich, and found that both reagents had a virtually identical efficacy against HRV1A (Figure 4A). Four of the sixteen niclosamide-related compounds had antiviral activity, comparable to niclosamide (Figure 4A and 4B). TVB-1326, 1332 and 1334 all contained features that stabilized their protonated forms, which suggested that the hydroxyl group at R1 or the central amide NH were the pH sensitive group. Condensation of the R1 hydroxyl group with ethoxy-phenyl (TVB-1329) did not diminish the antiviral efficacy compared to niclosamide, indicating that the R1 hydroxyl group alone was not essential. However, substituting the R1 hydroxyl proton with an alkyl group and replacing the electro-negative R4 Cl group with hydrogen (TVB-1328, 1331, 1333, and 1324) eliminated antiviral activity. The same was true when the electron-withdrawing nitro group at R6 was replaced by less electron-withdrawing groups (TVB-1338, 1335, 1336). The importance of the electro-negative groups on the benzene rings was confirmed by the reduced antiviral efficacy of TVB-1323, 1325, 1327, 1330 and 1337.",

To quench FITC fluorescence the liposomes were loaded at pH 5.15 in a manner similar to endosomes loaded with dextran-FITC [34]. Upon short incubation with niclosamide the FITC-fluorescence was rapidly dequenched with half maximal efficacy at 14 \u00b5M (Figure 5A). Fluorescence dequenching was similar to the protonophores DNP (dinitrophenol) or CCCP (carbonylcyanid-m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone), validating the assay system. Notably, niclosamide did not affect the integrity of the liposomes, indicated by laser scatter size determination and electron microscopy of negative stained liposomes, whereas the detergent Triton X-100 disintegrated the liposomes. These data supplied direct evidence that niclosamide acted as a proton carrier from acidic vesicular lumen to the pH neutral cytosol (Figure 5B).",

Niclosamide is well tolerated in humans. It can be orally used at 2 g per adult for cestocidal treatment, leading to maximal serum concentrations of 0.25 to 6.0 \u00b5g/ml corresponding to 0.76\u201318.35 \u00b5M, which is well within the anti-viral active concentration range and is non-toxic in humans [36]. Niclosamide is a salicylamide compound, similar to the thiazolide nitazoxanide, a pro-drug of the active compound tizoxanide [37]. Nitazoxanide was shown to have a broad spectrum of efficacy, albeit with an unknown mode of action. It has anti-protozoan activity and efficacy against influenza virus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, norovirus and is in phase II clinical trials for chronic hepatitis in combination therapy with interferon [38]\u2013[40]. It was also reported to inhibit the maturation of influenza virus hemagglutinin, presumably in the Golgi apparatus and to disrupt the membrane potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n[41], [42]. Nitazoxanide (pKa 5.8) also has antiviral efficacy against hepatitis C virus (HCV), presumably by activating protein kinase R (PKR) [PKR, 43]. However, using PKR-knock out mouse embryo fibroblasts [44], we did not find a role of PKR in niclosamide mediated block of infection with HRV1A (data not shown). Nonetheless, niclosamide inhibits infection with the pH-dependent viruses, HCV and SARS coronavirus [40], [45], [46], but the mechanism of inhibition was unknown.",

            "text": "Here, we show that niclosamide inhibits infection with human rhinoviruses and influenza virus by blocking the acidification of the endolysosomal compartments. Niclosamide did not affect viral uptake into cells, since it acted post conversion of HRV upon receptor engagement and post the 19\u00b0C endocytic compartment. Instead, niclosamide acted as a proton carrier and synergized with the inhibitory effects of the v-ATPase inhibitor BafA1. This process affects pH homeostasis of endosomes, which is tightly maintained in normal cells, [reviewed in 47]. The mode of action of niclosamide is different from the v-ATPase inhibitor BafA1, or the lysosomotropic agents ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) or chloroquine. The latter are trapped as cationic species in the acidic organelles owing to their basic pKa, thereby elevating the endosomal pH [48]. We speculate that the lower apparent toxicity of niclosamide compared to v-ATPase inhibitors could be due to a pH-tuned action based on the mildly acidic pKa of niclosamide. This would be different from bafilomycin, which blocks the rotation of v-ATPase subunits during proton flux independent of the luminal pH [30]. Niclosamide did not affect the ATP hydrolysis in purified CCV unlike BafA1 and required lower micromolar concentrations for antiviral efficacy than lysosomotropic agents, while NH4Cl is effective at low millimolar concentrations [49], [50]. Comparably, chloroquine has an IC90 of 20 \u00b5M for hepatitis C virus [51], or mono-dansyl-cadaverine has an IC50 of 50\u2013100 \u00b5M against dengue virus [52]. Unlike NH4Cl, niclosamide does not apparently induce intracellular vacuolization, suggesting that it does not accumulate in the aqueous lumen of low pH compartments. This is supported by the observation that the hydrophobicity index of niclosamide increases from neutral to acidic pH as shown by experimental data [33].",

            "text": "Niclosamide acts differently than classical ionophores. Nigeracin, for example, is a mitochondrial proton gradient uncoupler at high concentrations of potassium ions (K+), and thereby catalyzes the electro-neutral exchange of K+ for protons without affecting the membrane potential [53]. The infection block by niclosamide was reversed by addition of low pH medium, suggesting that the endosomal pH rather than a pH gradient across the endosomal membrane is crucial for HRV infection. This is distinct from valinomycin, which disrupts the membrane potential by shuttling Na+ and protons. It is also unlikely that niclosamide neutralizes the endosomal pH by inhibition of counter-ion influx, since cation efflux rather than anion influx accompanies endosomal acidification at least in the mildly acidic range [54]. Further, the chemical properties of niclosamide make it unlikely that it acts as an alkali ionophore, such as monensin, which forms zwitter-ionic complexes with monovalent cations and transports them through membranes [55]. Interestingly, niclosamide and its related compounds not only inhibited the pH-dependent viruses HRV1A, 2, 14, and 16, but also, albeit moderately, the less pH-dependent strain CVB4. These results are in good agreement with the infection inhibition profile of EIPA (ethyl-isopropyl-amiloride), an inhibitor of the sodium-proton exchanger regulating endosomal pH [56]. For example, the niclosamide-sensitive CVB4 was as sensitive to EIPA as HRV1A, 2, 14 or 16, while the niclosamide-insensitive CVB3 was not affected by EIPA (data not shown). This suggests that the ionic milieu of endosomes affects infections, possibly by controlling membrane trafficking or homeostasis. This was supported by the observation that niclosamide altered the mildly acidic EEA1-positive early endosomal compartments. It is possible that luminal pH controls the interaction of the membrane trafficking regulator Arf6 with the c-subunit of the v-ATPase complex, and the Arf GTP-exchange factor ARNO with the membrane embedded a2-subunit, which anchors the ATPase complex in the membrane and controls proton transport [57].",

Modifications in its chemical structure, e.g. generation of a pro-drug may prove useful to advance the potential of physico-chemical interference for the treatment of respiratory viral infections. The fact that niclosamide is a protonophore independent of protein targets with broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy enforces the concept of host targeting for antiviral therapies.

For all experiments, the multiplicity of infection (moi) was chosen such that approximately 20\u201340% of the cells were infected at 7 h post infection (pi) (HRV &CV), 8 h pi (FLU) or 18 h pi (HSV). Cells were fixed by adding 1/3 volume of a 16% para-formaldehyde solution, washed with PBS, PBS/25 mM NH4Cl and PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma), washed twice with PBS and blocked with PBS/1% BSA (Fraction V, Sigma). Antibodies detecting viral infection were used as follows: mAB J2 (English & Scientific Consulting, Bt. Szir\u00e1k, Hungary) to detect HRV and CV infections [21], and mAB HB65 detecting flu nucleoprotein (kind gift from J. Pavlovic, University of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland). For secondary reagents we used Alexa-fluor labelled antibodies (Invitrogen) together with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to stain nuclei. Automated image acquisition was performed with an ImageXpress Micro (Molecular Devices) equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ 12bit grey-scale camera (Roper Scientific) and 10\u00d7 SuperFluor Na 0.5, 20\u00d7 SuperFluor Na 0.75, 40\u00d7 SuperFLuor Na 0.95 (Nikon) objectives. Routinely, 9\u201320 images per well were acquired yielding an average of 5000\u201312000 cells analysed per well and data point. Image overlays where made using MetaXpress (Molecular Devices) and ImageJ (NIH Image, http://rsbweb.nih.gov/nih-image/). Images were analyzed using a custom written Matlab routine [21]. Dose response curve fittings were obtained with PRISM software (version 5.01, GraphPad Software Inc.) using standard Hill curve fittings. Infection indices were represented as a function of log10 inhibitor concentrations to determine the IC50 value for each drug, that is, the concentration of the drug provoking a response half way between the top response of the infection assay and the maximally inhibited response using variable slope model, representing a four-parameter dose-response curve.",
