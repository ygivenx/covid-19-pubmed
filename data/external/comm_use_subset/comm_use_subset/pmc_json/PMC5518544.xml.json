            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAV) have been isolated from a wide range of bird species including ducks, turkeys, and chickens but also from mammals (Yoon et al., 2014). Depending on their pathogenicity in specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, avian influenza viruses (AIV) are divided into highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) and low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV). HPAIV are associated with systemic infections and high mortality rates in poultry. Their virulence is influenced by the multibasic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin (HA) which is cleaved by ubiquitous endoproteases including furin and the protein convertase 5/6 allowing systemic spread of the infection (Horimoto et al., 1994; Feldmann et al., 2000). HPAIV have been isolated from different organs including breast muscle, feather follicle, liver, blood, egg content and the oviduct of chickens and Japanese quail (Promkuntod et al., 2006; Beato and Capua, 2011; Silva et al., 2013). LPAIV are of low virulence for most avian species (Alexander, 2000). The HA of most LPAIV has a monobasic cleavage site that needs to be activated by trypsin-like proteases which are believed to be present only in a restricted number of tissues such as the respiratory and intestinal tract (Klenk et al., 1975; B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al., 2013). It has been shown that in vitro infection of various tissue cultures with LPAIV requires exogenous trypsin supplementation for proteolytic activation (Klenk and Rott, 1988; Klenk and Garten, 1994). The infection with IAV is highly dependent on the availability of sialic acids. AIV bind preferentially to \u03b12,3 linked sialic acids while human IAV bind preferentially to \u03b12,6 linked sialic acids. Both linked sialic acids were previously described in different avian species and showed variable expression patterns between species (Kimble et al., 2010; Pillai and Lee, 2010; Mork et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Different IAV-subtypes play an economically important role in poultry species, especially in turkey, being one of the most susceptible poultry species even for LPAIV (Alexander, 2003; Tumpey et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2015). An infection with pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) was reported in turkey breeders in Chile where birds showed a decline in egg production and shell quality (Mathieu et al., 2010). A different study reported limited susceptibility of turkeys to pH1N1 infection (Kalthoff et al., 2010). Intrauterine infection of turkey hens with pH1N1 was shown to be possible by insemination, which revealed the importance of this route of exposure in turkey production (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2010). Breeder turkeys infected with H3N2 layed virus-contaminated eggs, which raised concerns regarding AIV dissemination in hatcheries (Pillai et al., 2010). In vivo infection of laying hens with H9N2 induced mild hemorrhages in the digestive and respiratory tracts associated with degeneration of epithelial cells and apoptosis in the reproductive tract (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015). In addition, immune-related genes including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) were upregulated (Wang et al., 2015). Similar lesions in the reproductive tract of laying hens were caused by H6N2 in California (Kinde et al., 2003). Meanwhile, H6N2 outbreaks in South African chicken farms were caused by a reassortment between H6N8 and H9N2 (Abolnik et al., 2007). Therefore, we selected three IAV-subtypes of economic importance (H1, H9, and H6) especially for the chicken and turkey production.",

Immature chicken oviduct explants were reported to be a successful in vitro infection model to study the interaction of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with host cells (Mork et al., 2014). Authors concluded that the IBV QX strain replicates efficiently in all oviduct parts. In vivo infection studies in chickens with H9N2 indicated that all oviduct sections were susceptible to infection with H9N2 with magnum cells being the most susceptible (Wang et al., 2015). No comparable study was performed in turkeys or Pekin ducks, which are known to show different susceptibility for AIV compared to chickens. While IAV-infection of chickens and turkeys is known to cause a decrease in egg production, no information is available about the interaction of the virus with the reproductive tract of less susceptible species including Pekin ducks. The investigation of IAV-interaction with the reproductive tract of different bird species may provide new insights into the role of the reproductive tract in the pathobiology and epidemiology of IAV. Due to the fact that is difficult to perform such comparative studies under in vivo conditions, it would be desirable to establish an in vitro model.",

At least five different birds from the same species were used per experiment. Oviduct explants (15\u201320/animal) were prepared. Subsequently, rings were randomly selected and transferred into 24-well plates (1 explant/well). Pekin ducks and turkeys were tested negative for antibodies against IAV. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance to the Animal Welfare Regulations of Lower Saxony. In agreement with the German regulations, authorities were notified in advance if animals were killed specifically for tissue collection (\u201cNotification of sacrificing animals for a scientific purpose\u201d from the 11.11.2015, 26.02.2014) or tissues were collected from animals which had been sacrificed for other purposes such as during diagnostic procedures in the diagnostic facilities of the University. Birds were sacrificed according to animal welfare regulations. Oviduct explants were placed immediately in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biochrom), 2% chicken serum (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S; 100 U/ml, 100 mg/ml) (Biochrom), 2.5 ug/ml Amphotericin B (Biochrom) and 1% of non-essential amino acids (Biochrom).

The magnum part was manually cut into small rings of 1\u20132 mm as previously described (Mork et al., 2014). Each magnum explant was subsequently placed in 500 \u03bcl medium and infected individually. One hour after infection, medium was replaced and magnum organ cultures (MOC) were incubated with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. No external trypsin supplementation was used throughout the experiment and media composition was the same between all experimental steps.",

The virus had been kindly provided by Hans-Christian Philipp from Lohmann Tierzucht (Cuxhaven, Germany). Pandemic A/Giessen/06/09 (pH1N1), a human isolate, was propagated and titrated in MDCK cells (Balish et al., 2013). A/turkey/Canada/1963 (H6N8) was kindly provided by Klaus Peter Behr from AniCon Labor (Hoeltinghausen, Germany), propagated in embryonated chicken eggs and titrated in MDCK cells. Titration of newly produced viral particles was conducted according to a modified protocol described previously (Baer and Kehn-Hall, 2014). Briefly, MDCK cells were plated in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h with 5 % CO2 at 37\u00b0C. Prior to infection, cells were visually evaluated. When 90% confluency was reached, cells were inoculated with 10-fold dilutions of different IAV-subtypes. After 1 h of incubation, the viral inocula were removed and cells were covered with overlay medium for 24 h in the case H9N2 and H6N8 and 36 h for pH1N1. The overlay medium contained 2% DMEM (10x) (Biochrom), 2.5% Avicel\u00ae (Sigma\u2013Aldrich), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma\u2013Aldrich), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Biochrom), 0.01% DEAE Dextran hydrochloride (Sigma\u2013Aldrich), P/S (100 U/ml/100 \u03bcg/ml) (Biochrom), 0.2% BSA (Carl Roth\u00ae, Karlsruhe, Germany) and 2 ug/ml trypsin (Biochrom). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde supplemented with 1% Triton X (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature followed by a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-washing step.

Foci formation was visualized by counterstaining with 3-Amino 9-ethylcarbazole (AEC, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and counted according to the formula described elsewhere (Baer and Kehn-Hall, 2014). pH1N1 and MDCK cells had been kindly provided by Stephan Pleschka, Institute of Medical Virology, Justus-Liebig-Universit\u00e4t (Gie\u00dfen, Germany).

For each species, MOC (n = 5/time point) were inoculated with 104 FFU (focus forming units) of H9N2, H6N8 or pH1N1/MOC. The infectious dose was chosen based on preliminary H9N2-infection studies performed in MOC-Ch (data not shown).

Conducting experiments with immature oviduct explants allowed avoiding physiological-related differences between bird species (Mohammadpour, 2007). It has to be recognized that the maturation of the oviduct may have been different between the bird species because of different age at the time of tissue collection. As demonstrated previously, age seems to have no significant or only minor influences on the distribution and staining intensity of \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 sialic acids (Pillai and Lee, 2010), which are important receptors of IAV, therefore we consider that the differences in age may be negligible with respect to the objectives of our study. LPAIV-infection of cells in vitro usually requires exogenous trypsin in order to ensure proteolytic cleavage of HA0 into HA1 and HA2 (Klenk and Garten, 1994). Our study is the first to report that IAV replicate in the avian reproductive explants without the need for exogenous proteolytic activation. This may suggest the presence of endogenous proteases in the epithelial cells of the reproductive tract being capable of cleaving monobasic cleavage sites (Lim et al., 2012), which has to be investigated in future studies.",

Overall, MOC-Du were shown, with all three methods, to be less susceptible in vitro for IAV-infection compared to MOC-Ch and MOC-Tu independent of the investigated influenza subtype. In vivo studies previously reported that ducks were less susceptible to LPAIV in comparison to other birds including domestic poultry, jungle crows, and tree sparrows (Hiono et al., 2016); whereas, authors did not investigate the reproductive tract. Possible differences in viral binding and replication of human-adapted virus pH1N1 and avian adapted viruses H9N2 and H6N8, could be the variation in the expression pattern of \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 sialic acids in the epithelial layer (Pillai and Lee, 2010). It is believed that human influenza viruses including pH1N1 bind preferably to \u03b12,6 linked sialic acids whereas AIV including H9N2 preferentially bind to \u03b12,3 linked sialic acids (Wan and Perez, 2006). Our results are in agreement with previously published data that indicated higher expression of \u03b12,3 linked sialic acids in all parts of the chicken oviduct compared to \u03b12,6 linked sialic acids which were less expressed particularly in the chicken magnum (Mork et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). This difference in receptor abundance may subsequently influence the replication level of different IAV (Suzuki et al., 2000).",

Further investigations are necessary to determine the exact location of \u03b12,6 linked sialic acids in MOC-Tu. Overall this suggests species specific differences, which may subsequently affect the susceptibility for IAV-infection. Similar observations about the more lateral distribution pattern of \u03b12,6 linked sialic acids in MOC-Tu have been made in pigs (Van Poucke et al., 2010; Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011; Trebbien et al., 2011). We may speculate that under field conditions, other pathogens lead to a destruction of the epithelial layer, making basolateral receptors more accessible (Rudd et al., 2016). Under in vitro conditions, these structures may be accessible due to the fact that MOC were excised and epithelial monolayer was not fully intact throughout the organ explant. Overall, our three detection methods including antigen staining, viral replication and genome copy numbers reflected the differences in IAV-susceptibility between MOC-Ch, MOC-Du, and MOC-Tu. At 12 hpi, results of the qRT PCR indicated significantly higher H9N2-genome copy numbers in MOC-Ch compared to MOC-Tu and MOC-Du, while no significant difference was observed between MOC-Tu and MOC-Ch at 24 and 48 hpi. This demonstrates that early H9N2-replication may be faster in the chicken oviduct compared to turkey; later on, the lack of target cells in MOC-Ch may lead to comparable FFU and Ct values between species. Our data also indicated less efficient replication of pH1N1 compared to H9N2 and H6N8 in MOC-Ch and MOC-Tu while no replication of pH1N1 was detected in MOC-Du. In contrast to H9N2 and H6N8, pH1N1-inoculation did not lead to major destruction of the magnum epithelium of MOC-Ch and MOC-Tu up to 48 hpi, the last time point of investigation for MOC-Tu and 72 hpi, the last time point of investigation for MOC-Ch. This suggests that virus replication level may correlate with lesion development.",

Overall, there was no clear correlation between H9N2-replication and IFN-expression levels for MOC-Ch and MOC-Du at neither of the investigated time points. pH1N1-replication levels were low in comparison to H9N2 in both species, and no IFN-expression was detected. Interestingly, H9N2 replicated to high levels in MOC-Tu, which also showed high IFN\u03bb expression levels in all investigated time points, indicating a possible correlation. On the other hand, there was no clear correlation between H9N2-replication rates and IFN\u03b1 mRNA-expression levels, which was also shown in a different study conducted in TOC of turkey with different IAV-subtypes (Petersen et al., 2013). There was a clear upregulation of IFN\u03bb mRNA expression after pH1H1-infection of MOC-Tu at 24 and 48 hpi; although virus levels had also increased, a clear correlation cannot be seen between both parameters. At this point there is no explanation behind the different regulation mechanisms of the IFN-response in MOC. However, differences in cytokine expression pattern in relation to the virus replication levels between MOC of different birds species support the observation that innate immune reactions may vary between bird species (Cornelissen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015)",

Infection of primary chicken lung cells with pH1N1 also did not lead to IFN\u03b1 upregulation expression while infection with H5N9 led to a significant IFN\u03b1 upregulation (Jiang et al., 2011). We may speculate that AIV, which are more adapted to chicken epithelial cells, may induce a higher IFN-type I response than human-adapted influenza viruses in bird tissue. This may be due to a different receptor spectrum between mammalian and avian species and subsequently a different replication level (Nicholls et al., 2007; Schrauwen and Fouchier, 2014).",

Our results demonstrated that the H9N2-infection of MOC of all investigated species led to a significant upregulation of IFN\u03bb mRNA expression compared to the virus-free controls. On the other hand, only pH1N1-infected-MOC-Tu demonstrated a significant upregulation of IFN\u03bb mRNA expression at 48 hpi compared to the virus-free controls (p < 0.05) while no change in expression was observed in MOC-Ch. The protective role of IFN\u03bb against AIV in the upper respiratory tract of chickens was previously described (Reuter et al., 2014). In mice, IFN\u03bb was shown to be highly efficient in preventing respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections with pathogens such as influenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Mordstein et al., 2010). Although we detected high expression of IFN\u03bb mRNA expression in MOC-Tu, this species was highly sensitive to IAV-infection. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the protein function of IFN\u03bb and its receptor in the avian reproductive tract. In addition, further cytokines being possibly involved in the innate immune response against IAV may be investigated in the future, to obtain a more complete picture about the virus-host interaction at the epithelial surface of the avian reproductive tract.",
