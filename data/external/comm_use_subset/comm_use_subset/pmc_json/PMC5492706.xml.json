Clinical signs are characterized by diarrhea and the appearance of a sticky exudate starting in the neck region, which to a variable extend may spread over the trunk and legs. Greasy, black claws maybe an early sign of the syndrome (Fig. 1). In fulminant, prolonged cases the perineal region becomes edematous and dehydration may develop together with a distressed vocalizing behavior [2].\n",

            "text": "Whole mink litters are affected and the morbidity rate vary from zero to more than 30% of the litters with a mortality of typically one or two kits per litter [3]. The syndrome is rather common in all mink producing countries although the number of farms and the severity of outbreaks vary from year to year [3]. The economic consequences for the mink farmers can be considerable due to cost for treatment and increased mortality. Efforts have been taken to identify etiologic microorganisms from outbreaks of pre-weaning diarrhea. Staphylococcus delphini and Escherichia coli have among other bacteria been incriminated as the causes of \u201csticky kits\u201d. However, mustelids are natural hosts of S. delphini group A and it has not been possible to link certain sero-groups of E. coli to pre-weaning diarrhea [4\u20136]. Mink astrovirus (MiAstV) and calicivirus were found to be associated with pre-weaning diarrhea [7] and rota- and coronavirus have been detected in mink kit feces in both healthy and \u201csticky\u201d kits [5, 8]. Thus, the syndrome is still regarded as multifactorial and different studies have been carried out to identify risk factors in management, feed, milk composition and animals [2]. Henriksen [8] was of the opinion that some feed kitchens were associated with a higher frequency of the syndrome than other feed kitchens, and the morbidity increased with high humidity, temperatures, population density and poor hygiene. In other studies no significant effect of poor hygiene was present, but problems with \u201csticky kits\u201d were significantly associated with diarrhea later in the growing season, and the problems had a tendency to recur at the farm the following year [9]. Studies on litter level revealed an almost four times increased risk of getting \u201csticky kits\u201d in young wild type mink females compared to older females [10]. Also large, late born litters and litters from primiparous females were at a greater risk of having \u201csticky kits\u201d [3, 10]. A higher frequency with pre-weaning diarrhea was seen on large farms compared to small farms and farms with occurrence of pre-weaning diarrhea had a lower feed consumption in late April and recurrent problems in the next season [11, 12]. In addition, females, which had been restricted fed for a prolonged period before birth, had a significant greater risk of having sticky kits/pre-weaning diarrhea in the kits [10]. Individual management practices for the farms include practices of litter equalization, introduction of new breeding dams, hygiene measures as well as biosecurity initiatives, which have not been fully studied. The aim of this study was to identify possible management risk factors on farm level concerning aspects of housing, hygiene, biosecurity and energy supply per female in late gestation for being a farm with outbreak of pre-weaning diarrhea. Secondarily, we also wanted to clarify the prescription patterns of antibacterials and some production efficiency parameters on farms with and without outbreaks of pre-weaning diarrhea.",

            "text": "A case\u2013control study was carried out from the 11th of May to weaning at the end of June 2015 on Danish commercial mink farms (n = 30). The first cases of pre-weaning diarrhea usually occur when mink kits are around two weeks of age, i.e. within the first 2 weeks of May. Since there was no surveillance system for this disease, and because farmers detected cases of diarrhea during their daily work, it was necessary for the investigation team to have pre-arranged agreements with a number of farmers (n = 53). Thus, from this group 15 farms, with a previous history of outbreak of pre-weaning diarrhea, called our investigation team for a visit when onset of pre-weaning diarrhea started, and these farms were designated \u201cexpected case farms\u201d. Concurrently, 15 farms, without a previous history of outbreaks of pre-weaning diarrhea, were randomly selected from the group of pre-arranged farms (n = 53) among farms, which received feed from the same feed kitchen in order to eliminate an effect of the feed composition and quality. These farms were designated \u201cexpected control farms\u201d. After June 2nd, no more farms contacted us concerning outbreaks. At weaning at the end of June, the percentage of affected litters recorded by the mink farmers was used to determine the final case\u2013control status of the farms. Case farms (n = 14) were defined as farms having 13\u201377% affected litters during the period, whereas control farms (n = 16) were defined as farms with <8% affected litters. Thus, one expected control farm changed status and became a case farm, whereas two expected case farms appeared to have such limited problems (<8% affected litters), that they were re-categorized as control farms. The rest of the included farms (n = 27) kept their expected status. Since the incidence rate of pre-weaning diarrhea varies from year to year on farms, and the prediction of which farms will be affected is uncertain, sample size calculations were not possible.",

The variables farm size, percentage of 1-year old females, and percentage of females with mastitis recorded by the mink farmer were dichotomized.

Finally, multivariable analyses using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel procedure and logistic analysis for all variables with a P < 0.05 in the bivariate analyses was performed. The reason for only including explanatory variables with a P < 0.05 was due to the small sample size of only 30 farms. The logistic analyses was conducted with proc logistic in SAS with the binary distributed case control status linked to the explanatory variables using the logit function (logit(P) = ln[p/(1\u2212P)]). Model fit was evaluated using the likelihood ratio test. We used manual model-building guided by a causal diagram with evaluation of confounding and interaction.

            "text": "Dogs\u2019 access to the farm area contributed to two of the models, which may reflect that dogs are carriers of microorganisms involved in the pre-weaning diarrhea syndrome. Another explanation is that dogs\u2019 access to the farm area was a proxy for other management of biosecurity and hygiene, meaning that farmers allowing dogs on the farm had a more relaxed approach to biosecurity and hygiene in general. Farm size was a risk factor in two of the multivariable models, which was also found in a study of pre-weaning diarrhea in pigs [18]. However herd size and herd density can be measured in different ways and the primary factor that produces the herd size effect may be found in management and environmental factors and can be protective as well [19]. The proportion of 1-year old females on the farm was a significant risk factor in bivariate analysis as well as in the multivariable analysis. This finding is in line with previous studies conducted on litter level [3, 10]. This might be explained by poorer nursing skills in the primiparous females or a poorer passive immunity transfer from young females to the kits compared to older females. A Norwegian study in dairy cows showed that cows in their fourth parity or more had significantly higher levels of IgG in the colostrum compared to cows in their first or second parity, and this might also be the case in mink [20]. Interestingly, the proportion of 1-year old females was significantly associated with farm size. Large expanding farms with ambitions of fast phenotypic improvement will have a consequential high female turnover which may be an explanation for this association. Thus, a high proportion of 1-year old females and a high morbidity rate will as a consequence prevent the mink farmers from accomplish a breeding strategy with selection on disease free animals including females with the best colostrum quality. The accumulated energy delivered per female in weeks 17 and 18 was significant in relation to case control status and corresponds to a daily supply of 799 kJ per female per day and 900 kJ per female per day for case and control farms, respectively. Hyperleptinemia in the pregnant mink may exert anorexigenic effects in the second but especially the last trimester resulting in a declining energy uptake and negative energy balance [21]. Some of the general declining energy consumption in the last gestation period is therefore due to a natural decline in appetite among the females. However there is no obvious reason why females on case farms should consume less than females on the control farms. Therefore, the mink farmers had restricted the minks\u2019 energy intake, perhaps in an attempt to get more active females prior to birth. The results is supported by other studies in which restricted feeding during the gestation period was found to be a risk factor for pre-weaning diarrhea in mink kits [10, 22]. Based on these studies, a critical limit of 879 kJ per female per day was suggested [23]. With considerable variation in weather, quality of insulation in nest boxes and management on the farms added to a tendency of increasing animal size, energy consumption and safety limits should continuously be evaluated. Mastitis as a triggering factor for \u201csticky kits\u201d has been suggested [8].",

Mastitis in the female may, however, still be a risk factor in a multifactorial disease complex, but further studies are needed to clarify this. Besides dogs\u2019 access to the farm area, no association to hygiene or biosecurity precautions was found. However, an explanation for the lack of proof for good practice of hygiene and biosecurity could be that the etiologic agents involved in pre-weaning diarrhea is very common in the animals during this period, and the cause should be searched for in a more generalized debility of the females and kits.",

Prescription of antibacterials has increased during recent years in Danish mink farms and associated with herd size, season and the laboratory diagnosis of MiAstV [17].
