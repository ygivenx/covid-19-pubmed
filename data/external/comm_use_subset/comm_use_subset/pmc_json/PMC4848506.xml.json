Previous studies have also revealed further subgroups, such as clade B1 and B2 among strains recently emerged in US303338. Upon VP1 analysis, 15 strains belonged to clade B, some of which being closely related to recent B1 strains from US. Five strains detected in 2014 form a potentially new clade, B3, together with strains from Taiwan and mainland China. The other 15 strains belonged to clade A, which can be further divided into two subclades, A1 (n = 2) and A2 (n = 13). Analysis of 2C and 3D sequences showed similar clustering (Supplementary Fig. 1). The four circulating lineages, clade A1, A2, B1 and B3, shared \u226591.8% aa identities to each other in partial VP1 and displayed distinct amino acid polymorphisms in VP1, 2C and 3D (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2).",

The B3 strains were only distantly related to recent B1 strains in US, suggesting the recent emergence of this novel subclade. Interestingly, adults/elderlies infected by EV-D68 were exclusively associated with clade A2, including five closely related strains from elderlies in 2013. Closely related B3 strains were also noted in six children in 2014.",

In the Netherlands, EV-D68-related respiratory illness has been described in adults but without clinical details2729. Two reports from China have identified 13 and two adults respectively with URTIs due to EV-D682839. A recent report from Denmark identified EV-D68 infections in two adults with URTIs and one adult co-infected by RV with fever, cough and breathing difficulties30. In this study, only one elderly presented with URTI alone, while another elderly with URTI was complicated by acute coronary syndrome. The other five elderlies presented with pneumonia, with two having respiratory or cardiac complications. Another 37-year-old adult also presented with pneumonia.

In particular, a number of EV-D68 specific diagnostic tools based on real-time PCR assays have been developed recently404142. Although commercially available multiplex PCR assays may include EV-D68, they may lack sensitivity and specificity, and may not differentiate EV-D68 from RVs42. Moreover, EV-D68 is seldom included in diagnostic panels for respiratory viruses, while most surveillance programs for EVs focus on stool samples. Inclusion of EV-D68 in routine respiratory virus panels may also help better assess its clinical and public health significance.",

EV-D68 appears to peak during spring/summer in our population, while a delayed autumn/winter peak was observed in 2011. Therefore, factors other than temperature may also play a role in the seasonality of EV-D68 infection. Lower respiratory illness was common among both elderlies and children, with pneumonia being the most common diagnosis. Many patients were also complicated by exacerbation of small airway disease, in line with the disproportionate presence of asthma among cases in US45. Interestingly, a 2-year-old girl (patient 1) had hand-foot-mouth disease which has not been previously reported for EV-D68, although the possibility of co-infection by other EVs cannot be excluded.

Moreover, adults/elderlies were infected exclusively by clade A2, suggesting that this lineage may be emerging in our elderly population. The recent emergence of EV-D68 in different countries may be due to viral evolution of strains/lineages with different antigenicity, with major bifurcation of currently circulating EV-D68 strains dated back to around 1945333539. The aa sequence patterns in BC and DE-surface loops, which determine the antigenic epitopes, may correlate with lineage classification35. The four lineages in this study also possessed distinct aa sequence patterns in BC and DE loops (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Moreover, most B strains circulating in 2014 formed a new separate subclade, B3, only distantly related to recent B1 sand B2 trains from US. Other potential B3 strains were also detected in Beijing and Taiwan in 2014 (Fig. 2). On the other hand, some of our B strains detected as early as 2011 were closely related to B1 strains from US. Our findings suggested that the recent epidemic in US may have originated from strains circulating in Asia several years ago, while a new lineage, B3, has only recently emerged in Hong Kong and neighbouring regions. More sequence data are needed to understand the genetic changes that may have driven the emergence of new lineages of EV-D68.",

            "text": "Different EVs are known to utilize difference receptors for cellular entry, which may explain their diverse clinical manifestations and tissue tropisms. In contrast to most EVs with enteric tropism, EV-D68 is seldom detected from stool of infected patients. Although EV-D68 possessed some properties of RVs, it does not utilize the receptors of RVs, namely intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) or low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R)4647. Instead, it shares the same receptor, decay accelerating factor (DAF), with EV-D70 and several echovirus serotypes254849. Interestingly, both EV-D68 and EV-D70 belong to the species EV-D, although EV-D70 is mainly associated with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis19. In addition, EV-D68 may use sialic acids as receptor, with preferential binding \u03b12\u20136-linked sialic acids (\u03b12\u20136 SAs) than to \u03b12\u20133 SAs, which may suggest higher affinity for upper respiratory epithelium4750. Since our results suggest that lower respiratory illness can be common in EV-D68 infections, further studies are required to investigate if some strains or lineages may possess higher affinity for the lower airway.",
