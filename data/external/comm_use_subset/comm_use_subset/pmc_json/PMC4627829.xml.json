The steroid dose was repeated once again after 24 hours. Patients allocated to Group 2 (n2=30) were not given any steroids and were taken as controls for the study. All the patients, irrespective of the study group, were taken up for surgical stabilization of their fractures as per their conventional management protocol. All patients were monitored for three days irrespective of the intermediate surgical interventions. Complete records were maintained for repeated clinical evaluation, including four hourly vitals (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and temperature) and 12 hourly ABG estimations for 72 hours. During these three days, once daily chest X-ray, hemogram, and coagulation profiles were taken.

Petechiae was the most sensitive indicator for FES, followed by hypoxaemia with arterial oxygen partial pressure (pO2 ) lower than 60 mmHg and positive X-ray findings. Patients with subclinical FES were identified as those in whom the score was less than five, but there were episodes of hypoxia diagnosed on serial arterial blood gas estimations. For the diagnosis of subclinical hypoxemia, all patients were classified into six subgroups (three in the control and three in the trial group) according to their pO2 values. We considered hypoxaemia with any pO2 < 70 mmHg and classified all patients in three categories: severe hypoxaemia (pO2 < 60 mmHg), mild hypoxaemia (60 mmHg < pO2 < 70 mmHg), and normal (pO2 > 70 mmHg).",

However, until a few years ago, the aerosol steroid therapy was effective only up to bronchial level. With the discovery of ciclesonide, which can reach up to the lung parenchyma, the effect can be achieved at the alveolar level. The efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids has already been clinically proved in chlorine gas-induced lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome due to sepsis [18-19]. As FES is also primarily a lung parenchyma disorder, it was hypothesized in this study that ciclesonide aerosol given as prophylaxis may be able to stabilize the lung parenchyma and thus able to bear the effects of post-traumatic fat globulinemia. This could prevent the development of hypoxemia or fat embolism syndrome in patients at high risk for this complication. There are still no studies regarding the role of inhaled steroids in the prophylaxis of post-traumatic hypoxia and fat embolism syndrome in the literature.",

Inhaled ciclesonide has been shown to be free from systemic side effects when used for management of asthma, even at high doses. Doses of 160 to 640 mcg have been employed in the treatment of bronchial asthma. A ciclesonide dose of 320 mcg is equivalent to 440 mcg fluticasone, the most potent inhaled corticosteroid [20-22]. Out of the 30 patients studied in Group 1, three had a Schonfeld\u2019s score more than or equal to 5, indicating clinical fat embolism syndrome. Six others with subclinical fat embolism syndrome had intermittent episodes of significant hypoxia and their scores were 3-4, whereas, in Group 2, eight patients had clinical fat embolism syndrome and six others had subclinical episodes of hypoxia.",

Although there is a biological plausibility that inhaled steroids may be useful, as shown by the study of intravenous steroids in the literature, as well as a trend seen in the possible preventive efficacy of inhalational steroid in the present study, it did not reach a statistically significant level in our study. The possible explanation could be a true inefficacy of the inhalational steroid, the small number of patients in our study, or the effect may be less pronounced than intravenous steroids that the study was not powered to detect. Therefore, larger study groups may be required to define precisely the role of inhalational steroids in the prophylaxis of post-traumatic subclinical and clinical FES. Moreover, as the etiology and pathogenesis of FES is still not certain, there may be other factors also contributing to the above results. Though the number of patients in the present study is small, it is observed that the prophylactic role of inhalational steroids, i.e. ciclesonide, in post-traumatic clinical and subclinical FES is statistically insignificant.",
