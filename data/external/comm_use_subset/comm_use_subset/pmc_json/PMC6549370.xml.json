This strategy classifies reads into different taxonomies or functional groups using reference-based methods and then conducts de novo assembly for reads within the same group. For example, VIP [15], drVM [16], and VirusTAP [17] all apply this strategy. They classify viral reads by either aligning reads to available viral references or removing reads of the host and other species. Next, existing assembly tools such as SPAdes [18] are employed to the virus-like reads to produce the final assembly results. While these tools made significant contributions in purifying the data by removing non-virus reads and then classifying virus-like reads into functional/taxonomic groups, their performance heavily depends on the quality of the references.",

Significantly, this is not simply due to the increased number of reads.

The improvement is not simply due to the increased number of reads after the recruitment stage.

Among the four assemblers used, PEHaplo of TAR-VIR and SPAdes produced good results with large N50 and high genome coverage. SGA generated larger number of contigs with low N50 value. While we have tried the best parameters for SAVAGE based on our empirical experience, its results are not consistent with the other three tools.

However, the size of the recruited reads depends more on the sequencing depth rather than the number of seed reads. Our experimental results also show that even a small seed set can recruit sufficient reads to cover the targeted genomes if the reads from these genomes share overlaps larger than the threshold. The quality of the seed set is more important to the performance of the read recruiting step.

These chimeras may have overlaps with more than one species, thus introducing contamination from the host or unrelated microbes. Figure 3a illustrates how contamination can be introduced via chimeric reads. In our experiments, we set the overlap threshold longer than half of the read size to prevent recruiting these chimeric reads or extending from them. To justify our choice of the overlap threshold for preventing contamination via chimeric reads, consider a chimeric read that is a concatenation of the sequences from the target virus and another species. There are two cases. In the first case, if the region from the target virus is shorter than half of the read size, this chimeric read will not be recruited. In the second case, if the region from the target virus is longer than half of the read size, this chimeric read will be recruited. However, as the other part of this chimeric read must be shorter than half of the read size (i.e. overlap threshold), this read will not be extended in the next iteration. Figure 3b shows this case. If the chimeric read contains regions from more than two species, it becomes harder for this read to form an overlap above the cutoff with reads from the target virus.\n",

Theoretically, different reads can be distinguished by appending unique delimiters at the end of each read. In our implementation, we use \u2018 $\u2019 as the delimiter for all reads. The read ID array RID is created only for suffixes starting with \u2018 $\u2019.
