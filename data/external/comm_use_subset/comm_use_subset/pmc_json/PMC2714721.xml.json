Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that are frequently associated with enteric or respiratory diseases in humans, livestock and companion animals (Dye & Siddell, 2005 \u25b6). At present, they are formally classified into three genetic groups (1\u20133), with the first two groups further divided into two subgroups (1a/b and 2a/b; Gorbalenya et al., 2004 \u25b6; Lai & Holmes, 2001 \u25b6), but as our understanding of natural coronavirus diversity progresses novel subgroups continue to be recognized (Woo et al., 2009 \u25b6). Viruses that belong to different subgroups have diverged profoundly. A fraction of their proteins are subgroup-specific and the amino-acid sequences of their most conserved proteins may differ by as much as 50%. The best-known member of this family, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), belongs to subgroup 2b, whereas feline coronavirus (FCoV), characterized in this study, belongs to subgroup 1a (Gorbalenya et al., 2004 \u25b6).",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a pathogenic FCoV variant that emerged by mutation of the relatively benign enteric FCoV (Poland et al., 1996 \u25b6; Vennema et al., 1998 \u25b6) and causes a fatal immune-mediated disease in cats (Pedersen, 1995 \u25b6). Since the variations are minor and despite the fact that we are working with a construct derived from an FIPV strain, we will henceforth use FCoV as an abbreviation for the virus. The FCoV genome (strain FIPV WSU-79/1146) consists of 29 125 nucleotides and contains six open reading frames (ORFs; Dye & Siddell, 2005 \u25b6). The first two ORFs, namely ORF1a and ORF1b, comprising the 5\u2032-most gene (i.e. gene 1), encode two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Proteolytic cleavage of these polyproteins by virus-encoded proteinases, i.e. the 3C-like main proteinase (Mpro in nsp5) and the papain-like accessory proteinases (PLpro 1 and 2 in nsp3), are predicted to give rise to a total of 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsps; Ziebuhr et al., 2000 \u25b6; Dye & Siddell, 2005 \u25b6). In addition to the proteases mentioned above, associated enzymatic activities have been identified for several coronavirus nsps, including deubiquitinating and adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) functions (nsp3), RNA-dependent RNA polymerases with low (nsp8) and high (nsp12) processivity, helicase (nsp13), RNA exonuclease and N7-methyltransferase (nsp14), RNA endoribonuclease (nsp15) and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (nsp16) (Anand et al., 2003 \u25b6; Bhardwaj et al., 2004 \u25b6; Chen et al., 2009 \u25b6; Cheng et al., 2005 \u25b6; Gorbalenya et al., 1989 \u25b6; Harcourt et al., 2004 \u25b6; Imbert et al., 2008 \u25b6; Ivanov, Hertzig et al., 2004 \u25b6; Ivanov, Thiel et al., 2004 \u25b6; Ratia et al., 2006 \u25b6; Seybert et al., 2000 \u25b6; Snijder et al., 2003 \u25b6). Tertiary structures, solved using X-ray or/and NMR analyses, have been reported for a substantial number of nsps from at least one coronavirus, typically SARS-CoV (reviewed in Bartlam et al., 2005 \u25b6; Mesters et al., 2006 \u25b6). These structures represent a variety of separate domains, entire proteins and even multiprotein complexes. Despite these remarkable advances, many domains, including those residing in nsp4, remain poorly characterized.",

It is predicted to be one of the three membrane-spanning proteins (the others are nsp3 and nsp6) among coronavirus nsps and bioinformatic analyses consistently predict four transmembrane domains in nsp4 (Clementz et al., 2008 \u25b6; Oostra et al., 2007 \u25b6). An N-terminal transmembrane region (amino acids 1\u201330) is presumably followed by a large lumenal domain (amino acids 30\u2013280), three closely spaced additional transmembrane regions (amino acids 280\u2013400) and finally a C-terminal domain of about 100 residues that is exposed at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Coronavirus infection induces the extensive reorganization of endoplasmic reticulum membranes into a reticulovesicular network (Knoops et al., 2008 \u25b6) that includes many unusual double-membrane vesicles (Gosert et al., 2002 \u25b6; Harcourt et al., 2004 \u25b6; Shi et al., 1999 \u25b6; Snijder et al., 2006 \u25b6; Stertz et al., 2007 \u25b6). It is currently believed that nsp4 functions in anchoring the viral replication\u2013transcription complex (RTC) to these modified membranes and independent genetic studies have demonstrated its importance for replication (Clementz et al., 2008 \u25b6; Sparks et al., 2007 \u25b6).",

Based on an initial analysis of the data, the maximum resolution for substructure determination and initial phase calculation was set to 3.8 \u00c5. 20 selenium positions were found using the program SHELXD (Sheldrick, 2008 \u25b6). The correct hand of the substructure was determined using the programs ABS (Hao, 2004 \u25b6) and SHELXE (Sheldrick, 2008 \u25b6). The occupancy of all substructure atoms was refined using the program BP3 (Pannu et al., 2003 \u25b6; Pannu & Read, 2004 \u25b6). The initial phases were improved using density modification, noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging and phase extension using the program RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2000 \u25b6). A partial \u03b1-helical model was produced using the program HELICAP (Morris et al., 2004 \u25b6). The partial model contained 119 of the total of 440 residues expected for four molecules. The initial phases were improved by phase combination of experimental and model phases using the program SIGMAA (Read, 1986 \u25b6). The density modification and fourfold NCS averaging were repeated again as described above. The resultant phases were used to continue model building using the program ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999 \u25b6), resulting in the placement of 242 residues. The partial models generated in the intermediate steps of ARP/wARP were then used to assemble an almost complete dimer using the graphics program Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004 \u25b6). This dimer was then used to find the second dimer in the electron density using phased molecular-replacement techniques as implemented in MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 1997 \u25b6). 2F\no \u2212 F\nc and F\no \u2212 F\nc electron-density maps calculated at this stage showed additional electron density indicating the presence of a fifth molecule in the asymmetric unit. The phased molecular replacement was repeated again to place the fifth molecule in the electron-density map. The resultant model was then used for restrained refinement in REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997 \u25b6), including use of the translation, libration and screw method (TLS; Schomaker & Trueblood, 1968 \u25b6) for describing group motions.",

The protein was also expressed with the substitution of methionine by seleno\u00admethionine (SeMet). The incorporation of SeMet was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Both native and SeMet-substituted proteins were crystallized from conditions containing ammonium sulfate and PEG 5000. The crystals belonged to space group P43, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 127.5, c = 42.8 \u00c5 (data set 2 in Table 1 \u25b6). There are five molecules (chains A\u2013E) in the asymmetric unit, which corresponds to a 64% solvent content (Matthews, 1968 \u25b6). The structure was refined at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution to a final R value of 24.0% (R\nfree = 29.9%).

The geometry in this region may be influenced by hydrogen bonding between Glu57 O\u220a and Arg61 N\u03b7. The refined structure contains two sulfate ions and 40 solvent molecules.

These viruses are FCoV (group 1a), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63; group 1b), murine hepatitis virus (MHV; group 2a), SARS-CoV (group 2b) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; group 3). The nsp4ct sequence identity between viruses belonging to the same group (but different subgroups) is higher than that for viruses belonging to different groups. The sequence identity between FCoV and HCoV-NL63 is 68% and that between MHV and SARS-CoV is 53%. IBV, on the other hand, is the most distantly related virus and its sequence identity in all possible combinations with the other viruses is around 35%. This is consistent with previously published phylogenetic analyses of coronaviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2004 \u25b6). The sequence alignment shows a high level of conservation of the nsp4ct domain, with 17 of around 100 residues being identical between all five subgroups. Most of the aromatic amino acids of coronavirus nsp4ct are highly conserved. This includes residues Phe19, Tyr41, Tyr50, Tyr60 and Tyr84, which are fully conserved, and Phe11 (Tyr in IBV), Tyr26 (Phe in IBV), Phe45 (Tyr in four other coronaviruses) and Tyr51 and Tyr75 (both Phe in MHV and SARS-CoV). Interestingly, Phe45, Tyr50, Tyr51, Tyr60 and Tyr84 are part of the FCoV nsp4ct dimer interface and the fully conserved Tyr60 forms a side-chain (O\u03b7) hydrogen-bond interaction with the main-chain carbonyl of Met55 from the second monomer. The two fully conserved C-terminal residues (Leu95 and Gln96) are part of the recognition site for the coronavirus Mpro (Hegyi & Ziebuhr, 2002 \u25b6).",

The second comprises residues 45\u201353 that belong to helix \u03b13 and part of loop L\u03b13\u2013\u03b14. Interestingly, the five independent chains of the FCoV nsp4ct structure differ most profoundly in this region, suggesting that it is highly flexible. In the cases of molecules B and E it was disordered and there was no electron density visible for residues 50\u201352 and 50\u201355, respectively. In molecules A, C and D this region could be placed into electron density and is involved in dimer formation. High sequence conservation of this cluster and its structural flexibility suggests that it may play an important role in the nsp4ct domain function. Residues 60\u201371 that belong to helix \u03b14 form the third highly conserved cluster and the fourth cluster consists of the C-terminal residues 81\u201396. This last cluster contains the highly conserved Tyr84, Pro86 and Pro87 which form the YxPP motif, which is the inverse of the consensus PPxY sequence recognized by the class I WW domains (Linn et al., 1997 \u25b6). Di Leva et al. (2006 \u25b6) showed that the class I WW domain does not require a peptide with a consensus sequence and can also bind an inverted peptide sequence. The only condition is the presence of the polyproline II (PPII) con\u00adformation, which is observed in the case of FCoV nsp4ct. This suggests that region 84\u201387 is a reasonable candidate for protein\u2013protein interactions. PROSITE (http://www.expasy.org/prosite/) analysis of all FCoV nsps did not identify any possible WW domains, suggesting that the YxPP motif interacting partner is a host protein. Furthermore, localization of the Pro\u2013Pro motif may protect the extended unstructured C-terminus from proteolytic cleavage by host enzymes (Vanhoof et al., 1995 \u25b6).",

In this context, it is a surprising finding that deletion of the nsp4ct of MHV (using a reverse genetics system) was reported to be tolerated by the virus (Clementz et al., 2008 \u25b6; Sparks et al., 2007 \u25b6), with the resulting mutant displaying a modestly attenuated phenotype. Thus, although a similar mutant has not been generated for FCoV or any other coronavirus, the conservation of the nsp4ct domain outlined above would suggest that it is not absolutely required for coronavirus RNA synthesis and/or RTC formation per se. This opens the possibility that, like some other recently characterized coronavirus enzyme functions (Eriksson et al., 2008 \u25b6; Roth-Cross et al., 2009 \u25b6), the nsp4ct domain might play a role in specific virus\u2013host interactions of the type that are not easily uncovered in cell culture-based systems for virus propagation. Further functional studies are required in order to better understand the detailed role of nsp4 and to identify its partners and therefore its significance in the viral life cycle.",
