APOBEC3 enzymes are considered to be part of the intrinsic defense system in eukaryotic cells, and can inhibit replication of some viruses and restrict mobile genetic elements. All APOBEC3 proteins share a cytidine-deaminase domain, which is identifiable by the primary amino acid motif His-Xaa-Glu-Xaa23\u201328-Pro-Cys-Xaa2\u20134-Cys, in which Zn2+ is coordinated. Deamination of cytidine results in its conversion to uridine. During this process, the ammonium group on C4 of cytidine undergoes nucleophilic attack by an activated water molecule and the APOBEC3 glutamate residue.",

The mechanisms and selective pressures that led to the APOBEC3 gene expansion in humans are unclear, but it is believed that all the genes originated from duplication of a single-copy primordial APOBEC3 gene.

Its function as an antiviral factor was discovered in 2002 through cDNA-transfer experiments that were designed to identify a cellular suppressor of an HIV-1 accessory protein, the virion infectivity factor (Vif). The primary antiretroviral activity of A3G requires its encapsidation into HIV-1 particles, and involves cytidine deamination of the reverse-transcribed first viral DNA strand, with mutations becoming fixed as G to A changes upon second-strand synthesis. Mutational frequencies can exceed 10% of all G residues (hypermutation), and may result in inhibition of viral replication. This activity is blocked by Vif protein, which specifically binds to and ubiquitinates A3G, directing it for degradation in the proteasome1,3,4. Other APOBEC3 proteins have been found to affect a wide variety of viruses, including other retroviruses (e.g., simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), foamy viruses), and DNA viruses (e.g., hepatitis B virus, parvovirus)5\u201314. As well as the inhibition of viral replication by hypermutation, APOBEC3-induced mutations also cause degradation of viral genomic material, mediated by cellular DNA-repair mechanisms15.",

HCoV-NL63 accounts for a considerable number of hospitalisations among children <18 years of age, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals19. A notable characteristics of coronaviruses is that their genomes are highly U/A-rich and C/G-poor. For example, HCoV-NL63 has 39% U and 27% A content, with only 14% C and 20%, G nucleotides28. The explanations for this bias is not yet known28,29. One possibility is that, over an evolutionary timescale, genomes of coronaviruses might have been shaped by cytidine deamination. Our aim, therefore, was to determine whether APOBEC3 proteins might be responsible for this modification. Our results demonstrate that three of the APOBEC3 proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H) can inhibit coronaviral infection in vitro.",

Thereafter, it was shown that A3G impairs the replication of mumps, measles and respiratory syncytial viruses. This antiviral activity is not an effect of APOBEC3 enzymatic activity, but is thought to result from the interaction of A3G with viral transcripts18. A3A has been shown to act as a mRNA-editing factor in human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages17. However, APOBEC3-mediated deamination of viral RNA genomes has not previously been demonstrated for viruses that do not replicate through DNA intermediates.

Surprisingly, if cells overexpressing A3C, A3F or A3H were infected with the progeny virions, no restriction of virus replication occurred.

A written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Tissues were procured at the Silesian Center for Heart Diseases, Zabrze, Poland. No organs/tissues were procured from prisoners. Cells were dislodged by protease treatment, and later mechanically detached from the connective tissue. Resulting primary cells were first cultured in selective media to proliferate. Further, cells were trypsinised and transferred onto permeable Transwell insert supports (\u03d5 = 6.5). Cell differentiation was stimulated by media additives and removal of media from the apical side. In such a manner cells were cultured for 6\u20138 weeks to form well-differentiated, pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium43.

To detect HA-tagged A3C protein cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse Alexa Fluor 647-labeled anti-HA-tag antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Poland) in 1 \u00d7 PBS with 3% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20. Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (0.1 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland). Immunostained cultures were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold antifade medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Poland). Fluorescent images were acquired under a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH). Images were acquired using ZEN 2012 SP1 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH) and processed using ImageJ 1.47 v (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).",
