Among these, Human Herpesviruses type 1 and 2 (HHV-1 and HHV-2), associated with cold sore and herpes genitalis respectively [1], are neurotropic and neuro-invasive double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses with the ability to induce persistent infection during the lifetime of the host, often in latent form with sporadic reactivation episodes induced by environmental or immunological conditions [2]. Therapy with nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir, whose mechanism of action is the inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, has been widely applied for the treatment of herpesvirus infections [3]. Nonetheless, drug-resistant strains are an emerging concern, especially in immunocompromised patients who are treated with these antivirals for a long time [3,4,5].",

Several efforts have been done to counter DENV spread via the biological and chemical mosquito control and the recent implementation of a licensed vaccine. Nevertheless, these strategies can induce some side effects, such as selection of resistant vectors [7,8] and increased risk of illness progression to more severe grades [9]. Therefore, the research of antiviral molecules to treat this disease is paramount. Like other positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, DENV has high evolution rates; therefore, the development of highly potent and selective antivirals can face a number of difficulties.",

[16], together with a doxorubicin derivate (SA-17) that has a squaric acid amide ester moiety at the carbohydrate group. Both were active against DENV-2 at low concentrations during the very early stages of the viral replication cycle (i.e., virus attachment and/or virus entry). During SA-17 treatment, time-of-addition studies revealed that at concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL (15 \u00b5M), the drug attained 98% and 42% inhibition of virus replication when was added at first 0 and 2 hours of infection, respectively. Additionally, this compound failed to efficiently inhibit viral replication when was added between 4 and 12 h post-infection and did not inhibit DENV-2 RNA replication. Using the same \u03b2-OG binding site of ENV protein, Kaptein et al. [16] reported molecular docking studies for SA-17, that formed hydrogen bonds with the amino acids Ala50, Tyr137 and Gln200, and had hydrophobic contacts with Thr48, Pro53, Lys128, Leu135, Phe193, Leu198, Ala205, Ile270, Gln271, Thr280 and Gly281, some of which are critical in membrane fusion during virus entry [16]. In our case, we found that doxorubicin forms hydrogen bonds with Glu26 and His27 and displays \u03c0-stacking interactions with Phe279 (Figure 4B). The molecule fits part of its structure into the \u03b2-OG binding cleft of the dengue virus E glycoprotein dimer with a similar but lower score (\u22126.5 kcal/mol) than NQ 4. However, no interactions were formed with any of those amino acids found for NQ 4, or those reported for SA-17 [16]. Considering this information, it is possible to propose that NQ 4 acts in a similar way as SA-17, probably affecting DENV-2 entry, rather than its attachment as we found for HHV-1.",

In this study, we have found a different kind of antiviral effect of quinones, showing that NQ 4 exerts anti-HHV-1 activity in early stages, specifically avoiding viral attachment. This compound possibly disrupts the entry of DENV-2. Some quinone derivatives may affect dramatically phospholipidic membranes and may be responsible for remarkable changes in their physical and biological properties. These alterations might consist in changes of lipid/water interface in negatively charged phospholipids and disruptions on the core of lipid bilayer [39]. This report may be consistent with our findings, considering that the lipidic membrane reconfiguration caused by this type of quinones may affect the initial interaction virus-cellular receptor, and the subsequent viral entry to the host cell. Indeed, on the basis of the predicted logP (clogP) values 3.47 (6.487), and the low tPSA (total Polar Surface Area) value of 44.6 estimated through the ChemDraw algorithms [40] for NQ 4, its membrane affinity appears fairly supported. However, additional experiments are necessary to confirm or refuse this mechanistic hypothesis.",

Additionally, the quinone moiety is present in some clinically useful anticancer agents as mitomycin C or doxorubicin. Mitomycin C is used in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors acting as a double-strand DNA alkylating agent [48], and doxorubicin is commonly used in cancer treatment, including breast, lung and gastric carcinomas among other, acting as DNA intercalating agent and generating free radicals that damage cellular membranes, DNA and proteins [49].
