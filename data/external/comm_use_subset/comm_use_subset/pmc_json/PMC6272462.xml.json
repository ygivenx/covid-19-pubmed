            "text": "Natural products (NPs), or synthetic products inspired by NPs, have been the single most productive source leads for the development of drugs. In fact, more than half of the approved drugs from 1981 to 2010 were based on NPs [1]. From the detection of the antibiotics properties of penicillin by Fleming in 1929, through \u201cthe Golden Age of Antibiotics\u201d when almost all groups of important antibacterial antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and macrolides) were discovered and into the late 20th century, the promise of unprecedented structural diversity and potent biological activity from microbial secondary metabolites remained a powerful force driving to pharmaceutical discovery. Microbes are the most prolific source of bioactive metabolites with a rate of 44%\u201346% comparing with the overall rate of 20%\u201325% for all NPs sources [2]. Furthermore bacteria are an exceptional source of small molecule chemical diversity. Although the terrestrial bacteria had been more studied in the past, a growing interest in its distribution and ecological role in the marine environment has been observed. The oceans are a highly complex microbiological environment with typical microbial abundances of 106 and 109 per ml in seawater and ocean-bottom sediments, respectively [3]. For instances, the rare and complex densely functionalized \u03b3-lactam-\u03b2-lactone pharmacophore, salinosporamide A (trade name Marizomib, NPI-0052), from the seawater-obligate marine actinomycete bacteria, Salinispora tropica, is heading for phase II clinical trials against cancer, but may not be a clinical candidate due to the demise of Nereus Pharmaceuticals in late 2013 [4]. As marine organisms are an important source of structurally diverse and biologically active secondary metabolites, a new branch of NPs chemistry had been fully established\u2014Marine Natural Products (MNPs). The current success rate of discovery from the marine world: seven clinically approved drugs [5], (four anticancer, one antiviral, one pain control, and one hypertriglyceridemia), from 22,000 discovered molecular entities [6] (e.g., one drug per 3140 NPs described) approximately 1.7- to 3.3-fold better than the industry average (one in 5000\u201310,000 tested compounds) [7].",

Thus it makes sense to use chemoinformatics approaches for the virtual screening of the most probable active compounds. Although, in the last years few computational approaches have been applied for in silico screening of NPs [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. This is a field that can be significantly improved by the modeling of data from large databases containing information relatively to biological activities, which are becoming available to the scientific community. AntiMarin [17] is a good example of a powerful database, which contains approximately 50,000 compounds from marine macroorganisms and both marine and terrestrial microorganisms. This database is, in fact, the result of a fusion between AntiBase [18] (a database of all terrestrial and marine microbial NPs) and MarinLit [6] (a database of MNPs literature). Therefore, besides MNPs we will refer the NP derived from microbial source as microbial natural products MbNPs, accounting for those of terrestrial origin.",

In the context of QSAR studies quantum-chemical descriptors, e.g., net atomic charges, HOMO and LUMO energies, hardness, chemical potential, electrophilicity index, have been shown to be useful in the estimation of various biological activities, for example in studies related with estimation of toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity as well as in studies of their mechanisms of action [20,21,22]. The usefulness of these descriptors was also been demonstrated by the estimation and study of antioxidant, antitumor or antibacterial activities. Theoretical studies of the electronic properties and chemical reactivity of quercetin [23], catechin and epicatechin [24] were as well reported. In other studies, the electrophilicity index was related to the ability of the NPs isoprekinamycin, kinamycins and lomaiviticin A acting as antitumor and antibacterial agents [25], to study the antileukaemic activity of phenol [26], and in suppression of breast cancer by chemical modulation of vulnerable zinc fingers in estrogen receptors [27]. Quantum-chemical descriptors have also been used in the analysis of the relations between the structural properties and the antitumoral activity of synthetic chalcones [28]. The antimicrobial activity of N-phenylbenzamide derivatives [29] and the antiparasitic activity of the nifurtimox analogues [30] are also correlated with electrophilicity index. In our group the combination of quantum chemical and empirical descriptors were used in the past to establish QSRR models for the estimation of Mayr electrophilicity with great success [31].",

The models were developed using 1746 active and non-active compounds from the PubChem database. State-of-the-art ML algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (Rfs) and Classification Tree (CTs), were compared to predict the two classes (i.e., active and non-active compounds) in the following classification tasks: (1) the overall biological activity; (2) the antitumor activity; and (3) the antibiotic activities. For each task three models were built using: 232 CDK descriptors, eight semi-empirical quantum-chemical descriptors calculated by the PM6 method (PM6 descriptors) and finally using simultaneously CDK descriptors and PM6 descriptors. Using internal (cross-validation and out-of-bag estimation on the training set) and external validation (on two external data sets from PubChem, test set I comprises of 863 compounds and test set II comprises of 183 active pharmaceutical ingredients) tests all of these QSAR models have been validated. In addition, a further test set (AntiMarin set) extracted from the AntiMarin database was used but not with the main purpose of external model validation. The results obtained with these three approaches were compared with our recently published work using only CDK descriptors [15].",

In the AniMarin database, as almost all databases, each molecule has been tested for only a few activities chosen by the researchers or grant programs, so there are almost certainly many bioactive molecules that lack an activity record. There are probably compounds that were classified as non-active against one given biological activity only because they have never been tested against that biological assay. Therefore, we would expect that the difficulty with this model was actually the false positives (FPs) for the AntiMarin set. In fact, we obtained a large number of FPs for the AntiMarin set, as shown by the low specificity value of 0.26 obtained for the best model (Rf using CDK+PM6) compared with the high specificity value of 0.77 obtained for the test set I, Table 1. The analysis of the results obtained from the best Rf model has shown that there are 76 and 15 FPs for the AntiMarin set and test set I, respectively. For these FPs, it was obtained an average probability of being active (Avg.Probactive) in the best Rf model of 0.66 (30 FPs have a Avg.Probactive \u2265 0.7), and 0.61 (2 FPs have a Avg.Probactive \u2265 0.7) for the AntiMarin set and test set I, respectively.",

Indeed, as recently reported [15], the analysis of the active and non-active profiles of the van der Waals volume of the training set and test sets from PubChem and AntiMarin set from AntiMarin revealed there is a correlation between active compounds and 3-, 4-ringed compounds with a van der Waals volume between 300 and 800 \u00c53. In the AntiMarin set, there are 87 compounds with these specifications. From those only 68 compounds (i.e., approximately 78%) are active as compared with approximately 96% of active compounds from the test set I compounds (PubChem) with the same specifications. Moreover, from those with the same specifications 59 and 14 compounds were predicted as true positives (TPs) and FPs with an Avg.Probactive of 0.73 and 0.70, respectively, using the best Rf model for the AntiMarin set. In the test set II, approximately 75% of the APIs with these specifications were predicted to be active by the best Rf model.

Using the first rule of the overall biological activity classification tree PM6 (\u03b5HOMO \u2265 \u221210.42 eV for active compounds) it was possible to correctly discriminate as active 1577 compounds, corresponding to ~98% of the training set, 774 compounds, corresponding to ~97% of the test set I, and 181 compounds, corresponding to ~99% of the test set II. It is known that the \u03b5HOMO and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (\u03b5LUMO) of a molecule play important roles in intermolecular interactions [34], through the interaction between the \u03b5HOMO of the drug with the \u03b5LUMO of the receptor and vice versa. Increasing \u03b5HOMO and decreasing \u03b5LUMO in the drug molecule lead to enhancement of stabilizing interactions, and consequently, binding with the receptor [34]. The remarkable performance of this descriptor in discriminating lead-like or drug-like compounds has never been reported, however it was reported that the \u03b5HOMO could be used to predict the potency of H2 blockers such as famotidine, ranitidine, and nizatidine and the authors found a positive correlation between the \u03b5HOMO and the potency of the drugs [35].

These values could be compared with the sensitivity and specificity values of 0.85 and 0.81 obtained for the test set I, respectively Table 2. The analysis of the predictions obtained for the AntiMarin set has shown that there are 18 TPs with an average probability of being antitumor (Avg.Probantitumor) of 0.60, as compared with an Avg.Probantitumor of 0.62 obtained for the 104 FPs predicted. In our opinion, these FPs are not all misclassifications by the antitumor model. Instead those with high probability of being antitumor (Probantitumor) are lead-like antitumor MNPs and MbNPs, which have been misclassified as non-antitumor compounds in the AntiMarin database. Although, there was obtained a high sensitivity value of 0.82 for the external test set II, was also achieved a low specificity value of 0.23. For the test set II were used the biological activity reported in the pharmacological classification of each API. However for this data set in the PubChem were reported an average value of 445 tested bioassays and for those an average value of 43 active bioassays. Therefore, we obtained 28 TPs and 46 FPs with a Probantitumor greater than or equal to 0.8. The analysis of the eleven FPs with higher Probantitumor (i.e., Avg.Probantitumor of 0.93) has shown that they all have at least one positive bioassay against cancer (available as Supplementary Material\u2014Table S5). These conclusions were also supported by the low percentage of misclassifications as FPs (1.04%) obtained for the test set I compounds with a Probantitumor greater than or equal to 0.8 using the best Rf antitumor model. In the Scheme 2 were listed the 4 FPs with a Probantitumor greater than or equal to 0.8 using the best Rf antitumor model. Two out of the four proposed lead antitumor compounds were also proposed by us using a CDK Rf model in our recently published work [15]. The other two FPs were similarly predicted as antitumor with a Probantitumor greater than or equal to 0.75 in the CDK Rf antitumor activity model [15]. Moreover, there are eight (IDs 78, 163, 449, 670, 918, 974, 1070, and 1102) out of sixteen proposed as lead antitumor MNPs and MbNPs from the AntiMarin database in our previous work that are not present in the currently study. The other five lead antitumor compounds (IDs 567, 580, 1066, 1071, and 1100) that had been recently highlighted in our studies are also predicted as antitumor compounds by the best Rf model with a Probantitumor of 0.78, 0.71, 0.55, 0.63, and 0.68, respectively. However, antitumor activity was reported more recently, for almost all of the 4 FPs that we obtained, namely (see Scheme 2): the phenazine derivatives ID 1032 as a light-activated tumor cytotoxic compound [39], the oxime derivative ID 662 against several NCI human tumor cells [40], and the nitrosohydrazone derivative ID 976 enhances the etoposide-induced cell death of human glioma cells through a synergistic effect with antitumor drugs by acting as inhibitor of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase [41]. The antifungal brominated phenylpyrrole derivative, ID 1042 (Scheme 2), is related to the chlorinated pyrrolnitrin, an antibiotic and antifungal MNP from test set I (CID 13916, see Scheme 3) that was recently reported as active in screenings for potential anti-tumor activity [42].",

From those seven FPs, four FPs (IDs 585, 586, 573, and 860) have been already analyzed in the overall biological model (Scheme 1). The other three FPs (IDs 695, 704, and 712) were reported before by us [15] as lead-like antibiotic compounds with a Probantibiotic greater than or equal to 0.9. Additionally, twenty one out of the twenty five proposed lead antibiotic compounds were as well proposed by us using the CDK Rf model [15]. The other four FPs (IDs 308, 527, 953, and 48363) were classified as antibiotic compounds in the Rf antibiotic model using the CDK descriptors and they were predicted as antibiotic with a Probactivity greater than or equal to 0.68 in the CDK Rf overall biological activity model [15]. From those 25 lead-like antibiotic MNP and MbNP, seven (IDs 484, 735, 742, 861, 959, 739, and 741) have been already analyzed in the overall biological model (Scheme 1). Scheme 4 illustrates the 15 FPs with a Probantibiotic greater than or equal to 0.8, which have not yet been reported in this work. As recently described from our team [15], several cephalosporin analogs that appear in the AntiMarin database without activity records, were classified as actives by the overall activity and antibiotic models indicating that the cephalosporin core structure appears to be relevant to the antibiotic activity. The structures could be seen in Scheme 1 (IDs 735, 739, 741, and 742) and Scheme 4 (IDs 695, 704, 712 and 938). However, it is not a surprising outcome, since penicillin and cephalosporin are well known antibiotic drugs and the earliest antibiotics discovered. A penicillin analog was also classified as FP, ID 493 in Scheme 4. Among other relevant types of antibiotics that were classified as FPs in both models are the aminoglycoside (ID 573) and the anthracycline antibiotics (IDs 860 and 861). Two unique cyclic peptides that incorporate unusual \u03bb-amino acids such as 4-amino-5-hydroxypenta-2-enoic acid, 4-amino-3,5-dihydroxypentanoic acid, and 4-amino-3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentanoic acid (IDs 48362 and 48363) were also classified as being antibiotic. As far we know the antibiotic activity of these compounds has never been recorded, but they were reported as shown immunosuppressive activity in an interleukin-5 production inhibition assay [43].",

All CDK+PM6 models were built using CPSA (charge partial surface area) [44], topological, constitutional, molecular descriptors, and semi-empirical quantum-chemical descriptors. The TopoPSA\u2014topological polar surface area\u2014descriptor [45] was selected to be used in all models. The models were built using three approaches, one with 232 CDK descriptors, the other with the 8 semi-empirical quantum-chemical descriptors calculated by the PM6 method and with the 232 CDK and the 8 PM6 descriptors. The selected and the most important descriptors obtained with these three approaches were compared with our previous studies [15] using only the CDK descriptors. The ten most relevant descriptors, found by the Rf algorithm, used to build the Rf models also include in almost cases the different types of descriptors mentioned above. The MeanDecreaseAccuracy parameter (Mean Decrease in Accuracy) of importance is considered more reliable than the MeanDecreaseGini parameter (Mean Decrease in Gini Coefficient) [46]. Taking into account the MeanDecreaseAccuracy measure in the best Rf model for predicting the overall biological activity, antitumor and antibiotic activities it is possible to correlate those activities with the type of descriptors selected. For instance, the overall biological activity appears to be related with the electronic, molecular and quantum descriptors. The CPSA, BCUT and WHIM descriptors as well as the \u03b5HOMO seem to have a main role in modeling the overall activity. The BCUT descriptors encode connectivity information and atomic properties of the molecule [47]. The WHIM descriptors are weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors that are built in such a way to capture relevant molecular 3D information with respect to molecular size, shape, symmetry and atom distribution [48]. Nevertheless, the antitumor activity appears to be largely related with the topological descriptors. In addition, the molecular distance edge descriptors (MDE), which evaluate molecular distance edge descriptors for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms, seems to be the most important type of the descriptors for modeling the antitumor activity. Only the MDEO-12 (molecular distance edge between primary and secondary oxygen atoms) and the khs.sssCH (a fragment count descriptor that encode the presence of a tertiary carbon group in which it has three single bonds) descriptors were selected for all machine learning techniques (i.e., CFS filter for SVM, the two measures of the Rf, and CT using the CDK+PM6 approach).

The training and the test sets are the same which had been used to build the QSAR models, for classification, of our previous work [15] (the data set was randomly partitioned in training and test set), with exception of a few compounds that produce error in the process for calculation of the semi-empirical quantum-chemical descriptors.

The training set consists in 1746 compounds and the test set I in 863 compounds. These datasets were used for the development and external validation of the QSAR classification models, respectively. A further set, AntiMarin set, with 418 MNPs and MbNPs was extracted from the AntiMarin database [6,17,18]. This set will not be used to test the model but to exploit lead-like molecules from MNPs and MbNPs. An additional test set, test set II was also extracted from PubChem, which contains 183 APIs with the following pharmacological classifications: 68 antitumor, 29 antibiotic, eight anti-HIV, 34 anti-inflamatory, 11 antifungal, six antiviral, six insecticides, nine antimalarial, and seven anti-ulcer. The chemical structures of the MNPs and MbNPs were downloaded in the MDL SDF format. The different sets were assembled and duplicates removed to avoid overlapping between the two databases. Although the chirality was taken into account, racemic compounds (or cases where the stereochemistry was not indicated) were considered as one of the possible stereoisomers.

After that, multilinear regressions (MLR) were built with Weka 3.6.5 [57,58,59] to select descriptors by the M5 method, using the training set which give origin to a set 232 descriptors. The next step in the selection of the best set of descriptors to model each activity consists in the application of the Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection algorithm [60] (the algorithm evaluates the usefulness of individual descriptors for predicting the given activity and also the level of intercorrelation among descriptors) implemented in Weka 3.6.5. The selection was performed using the AttributeSelectedClassifier routine of Weka with the CfsSubsetEval option as descriptor evaluator and the BestFirst, LinearForwardSelection or GreedyStepwise option as search methods within a ten-fold cross-validation procedure and k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm as ML technique.",

The best split at each node was defined among a randomly selected subset of descriptors. Prediction is made by a majority vote of the classification trees in the forest. The performance is internally assessed with the prediction error for the objects left out in the bootstrap procedure (internal cross-validation or OOB estimation). In addition, the method quantifies the importance of a descriptor by the increase in misclassification occurring when the values of the descriptor are randomly permuted, correlated with the mean decrease in accuracy parameter, or by the decrease in a node\u2019s impurity every time the descriptor is used for splitting, correlated with the mean decrease in the Gini coefficient parameter. Rfs also assign a probability to every prediction on the basis of the number of votes obtained by the predicted class. A measure of similarity between two objects can be calculated from the number of trees in the ensemble that classify the two objects in the same terminal node. Rfs were grown with the R program, version 2.13.1, using the Random Forest library [63]. The Rf models were built with 500 trees and by three approaches, one using 232 CDK descriptors, the other using 8 semi-empirical quantum-chemical descriptors calculated by the PM6 method (PM6 descriptors) and finally using both the 232 CDK descriptors and the 8 PM6 descriptors.

The result of the application of this approach is the reduction in great extent the number of compounds used in real screens and on the other hand, allows to confirm our previous previsions. The obtained results for the presented virtual screening of possible lead compounds en route to antitumor and antibiotic drugs were also externally supported by the publication in the literature as active compounds of some of the compounds proposed and initially classified in the AntiMarin database as non-active compounds or without activity record. The remarkable performance of the \u03b5HOMO quantum-chemical descriptor in the discrimination in large scale data sets of lead-like or drug-like compounds has never been reported. The evaluation of the discriminating power of this quantum descriptor, calculated at a quantum level, in large sets of bioactive molecules could be an interesting approach in future works.",
