            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe enteric illness of swine (PED). The infection results in watery diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia, which can lead to death in up to 100% of neonatal piglets [1,2]. Since its first appearance in the 1970s, PED outbreaks have caused enormous economic losses to the swine industry. Nowadays, outbreaks of PED are sporadically reported worldwide with emerging novel strains [3,4]. PEDV is an enveloped, non-segmented, positive-strand RNA virus, which constitutes the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Its RNA genome encodes replicase proteins and structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and an accessory protein (ORF3). The virus replicates efficiently in the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine, leading to cell death and severe villous atrophy [1].",

In particular, it has been shown that the structural proteins including S, M, and E proteins are gathered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where they interact with the N protein-encapsidated viral genomes and assemble into viral particles followed by release via exocytosis of smooth-wall vesicles [5]. Coronavirus (CoV)-infected cells typically exhibit multinucleated giant syncytia triggered by the interaction of S at the cell surface and receptors of adjacent cells. S has been shown to be predominantly localized in the ERGIC or Golgi complex in cells transiently expressing S and M [6,7]. The interaction between S and M requires the ER retention signal (ERRS) comprising the tyrosine-dependent motif (Yxx\u03d5; \u03d5 is a hydrophobic residue) and the KxHxx motif at the C-terminus of S [8]. However, it remains largely unknown, in the context of infection, how S could escape the ER\u2013Golgi retention and transit to the plasma membrane.",

However, those infected with early passaged PEDV strains or those freshly isolated from infected intestinal tissues rarely exhibited detectable syncytium formation [9,10]. In the current study, we investigate the ability to trigger cell\u2013cell fusion by S derived from a poorly culturable isolate, G2, and that from a well-characterized cell-adapted strain, YN144, in the GII genogroup [11,12]. We then constructed various chimeric S constructs and evaluated cell\u2013cell fusion in cells expressing each chimera. We could identify a key amino acid in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S that plays a critical role in syncytium formation and growth in VeroE6-APN cells. Intriguingly, we also showed that S-mediated syncytium formation in Huh-7 cells was distinct from that in VeroE6 cells. The data presented here may provide more insights into the quest for PEDV receptors among various host cells.",

Not only does it replicate efficiently in mammalian cells, but it also exhibits a highly syncytial phenotype in cell culture [11,12]. While the C-terminal motifs are believed to play a key role in its ability to trigger cell\u2013cell fusion [14,15,16,17], it is important to note that SYN144 harbored no change of amino acids at the C-terminal region upon multiple passages [12]. To confirm the ability of SYN144 in syncytium induction, we synthesized codon-optimized SYN144, cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector and evaluated the cell\u2013cell fusion activity in transfected VeroE6-APN cells. Notably, codon-optimization is required to obtain a detectable expression of CoV S in transfected cells [18]. As depicted in Figure 1A, cells transfected with pCAGGS expressing SYN144 exhibited clear syncytium formation in the presence of trypsin. Without trypsin treatment, no syncytia were observed (Figure 1A). We subsequently removed the C-terminal motifs from the SYN144 (SYN144 \u0394ERRS) and evaluated the syncytium formation in transfected VeroE6-APN cells in the presence and absence of trypsin. The absence of the C-terminal motifs resulted in the induction of notably larger syncytium formation in transfected cells (Figure 1A). In contrast to SYN144, when we transfected VeroE6-APN cells with pCAGGS expressing SG2, we could not detect any syncytia even in the presence of trypsin or absence of the C-terminal motifs (Figure 1B). Of note, the expression level of SG2 and SYN144 were shown previously to be comparable [9], thereby suggesting that the loss of cell\u2013cell fusion activity was not due to the difference in protein expression. These results suggest that S derived from the cell-adapted variant can trigger syncytium formation regardless of the C-terminal motifs, corroborating the notion that changes during serial passages may enable the S protein to trigger cell\u2013cell fusion in cultured cells.",

To this end, we transfected VeroE6-APN cells and assessed the surface expression of SG2\u0394ERRS by confocal microscopy. As a comparison, SYN144\u0394ERRS was also investigated. We found that both SG2\u0394ERRS and SYN144\u0394ERRS displayed comparably strong surface expression (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, despite the apparent syncytium formation, the inclusion of the C-terminal motifs to SYN144 resulted in a substantial decrease in surface expression (Figure 2A). Moreover, SG2 containing the intact C-terminal motifs (SG2) also showed hardly detectable surface expression (Figure 2A), confirming the role of ERRS in S cellular trafficking. To further confirm the results obtained from the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), we employed flow cytometry to assess the surface expression of SG2\u0394ERRS. As expected, the absence of the C-terminal motifs could significantly augment the surface expression of both SG2 and SYN144 (Figure 2B). The fact that SG2\u0394ERRS showed strong surface expression but could not trigger detectable syncytium indicates that surface expression alone may not be sufficient to trigger cell\u2013cell fusion.",

We thus sought to determine whether the RBD and the S1/S2 cleavage site (S1/S2) contribute to the syncytium induction activity of SG2 and SYN144. To this end, we constructed the chimeric SYN144 harboring the RBD and S1/S2 derived from SG2 (SYN-G2) as well as the SG2 carrying the RBD and S1/S2 of SYN144 (SG2-YN) (Figure 3A). Of note, to rule out the effect of surface localization, all constructs were devoid of the C-terminal motifs. When each construct was evaluated for its ability to trigger syncytia in transfected cells, we found that while SYN144 triggered large syncytia, SYN-G2 failed to do likewise, similar to that in cells transfected with SG2 (Figure 3B). In contrast, we detected clear syncytium formation, albeit relatively smaller than those of SYN144, in cells transfected with SG2-YN (Figure 3B). Notably, the absence of syncytia in cells expressing SYN-G2 and SG2 was not due to a defect in protein expression, as the western blot analysis showed relatively high protein expression of all constructs (Figure 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that amino acids in the RBD and S1/S2 of PEDV S could influence S-mediated induction of cell\u2013cell fusion in VeroE6-APN cells.",

As shown in Figure 5A, cells expressing SG2A carrying H493Y and T550S did not display detectable syncytium formation. In contrast, those expressing SG2A with A475S and V672F exhibited detectable syncytia. Among all mutations, cells expressing SG2A with V672F mutation showed remarkably large syncytia, suggesting that F at the position 672 is critical for the syncytium formation in VeroE6-APN cells. Furthermore, when cells expressing SG2A carrying double mutations (A475S, V672F) were assessed for syncytium formation, we observed syncytia slightly larger than those with a single V672F substitution (Figure 5B). These data altogether point to the possibility that A475S might synergize with V672F in promoting cell\u2013cell fusion. To investigate the importance of the F672 residue, we introduced a single V672F substitution to SG2 (SG2-V672F) and evaluated its ability to induce cell\u2013cell fusion. While the wild-type SG2 could not trigger detectable syncytium in transfected cells, we could detect large syncytia in VeroE6-APN cells expressing SG2-V672F (Figure 5B). Notably, cells expressing SG2 with a single A475S mutation (SG2-A475S) did not show detectable syncytium formation. However, when double mutations (A475S, V672F) were introduced, large syncytia were observed (Figure 5C). It is also important to note that syncytia in SG2-V672F-transfected cells were smaller than those transfected with SG2A-V672F (Figure 5B), thereby further supporting the notion that other amino acids in the SYN144 might work in concert with V672F to drive the optimal cell\u2013cell fusion.",

Since our results were based on the transfection of plasmids in VeroE6-APN cells, we asked whether the expression of chimeric S in the parental VeroE6 cells would result in syncytium formation in a similar manner. To this end, we transfected pCAGGS expressing S of various constructs into parental VeroE6 cells and examined the syncytium formation. As shown in Figure 6, similar to what was observed in VeroE6-APN cells (Figure 4 and Figure 5), VeroE6 cells displayed large syncytium formation when transfected with the plasmid expressing SG2B and SG2A-V672F. In contrast, those transfected with the plasmid expressing SG2A showed undetectable syncytium formation. These data suggest that PEDV S likely binds to the receptor present in both VeroE6 and VeroE6-APN cells.",

Indeed, the fact that the V672F substitution could enhance S-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion in VeroE6 cells points to the possibility that this residue might be important for the interaction of S and its receptor. To test whether V672F is specific for the receptor of VeroE6 cells, we transfected VeroE6 and Huh-7 cells with plasmids expressing various constructs of S and compared syncytium formation in both cell lines. To our surprise, large syncytia could be detected in Huh-7 cells transfected with all chimeric S constructs including the SG2A that could not trigger cell\u2013cell fusion in VeroE6 cells (Figure 7). Interestingly, we also found syncytium formation in Huh-7 cells transfected with pCAGGS expressing SG2. These results suggest that the mode of binding between S and receptors on VeroE6 cells may be different from that of Huh-7 cells.",

We subsequently rescued the viruses and assessed their growth in VeroE6-APN and Huh-7 cells. As expected, while PEDV with the wild-type SG2 grew poorly with undetectable syncytia (data not shown), the virus carrying the V672F mutation showed clear syncytium formation during the first passage in VeroE6-APN cells (Figure 8B). The replication kinetics of the recombinant virus also correlated with the ability to form syncytia in infected cells (Figure 8C). Notably, both recombinant viruses could grow in Huh-7 cells with comparable growth kinetics (Figure 8C). Interestingly, the recombinant virus bearing SYN144 with F672V exhibited significantly slower growth kinetics when compared to those with the wild-type SYN144 in VeroE6-APN but not in Huh-7 cells (Figure 8C). Taken together, these data suggest that V672F could enable SG2 to possibly bind to its receptor, undergo cell\u2013cell fusion, and initiate replication in VeroE6-APN cells.",

Although cells infected by cell-adapted PEDV usually display extensive syncytia, those infected by early passaged PEDV strains or in vivo exhibit minimal, if not undetectable, syncytium formation. While it is clear that changes in the S protein accumulated during consecutive passages in Vero cells are associated with the ability of S to induce large syncytium formation, the mechanism by which these mutations in the S protein affect the cell\u2013cell fusion and virus growth in the host cells is still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the ability of PEDV S to induce syncytium formation in VeroE6 cells using those that derived from a field isolate (G2) and a cell-adapted variant (YN144).",

However, it is not clear how S, especially of cell-adapted strains, could transit to the plasma membrane as its cellular localization is known to be tightly regulated by the C-terminal motifs [5]. A few cell-adapted strains in the GI genogroup such as SM98, AVCT12, or CHM2013 or GII genogroup such as FL2013 could form large syncytia in infected cells mainly due to the natural C-terminal deletion of the S gene [13,27,28]. Interestingly, Vero cells infected with some cell-adapted strains, such as YN144 [12], PT-P96 [29], or KNU-141112 [30], could exhibit large syncytia even though the viruses still possess the intact C-terminal motifs. We showed here that SYN144 displayed hardly detectable cell surface expression, while SYN144\u0394ERRS showed strong surface expression in transfected cells (Figure 2A). These data thus suggest that a minute amount of the S protein on the cell surface might be sufficient for the induction of syncytium formation. It is also important to note that SG2\u0394ERRS, though it displayed strong surface expression, could not form detectable syncytium in VeroE6-APN cells (Figure 2A), which further supports the notion that the surface expression is not sufficient for promoting syncytium formation in cells expressing PEDV S.",

Syncytium formation in cells expressing various chimeric S constructs indeed revealed that the RBD of SYN144, but not the S1/S2 junction or fusion peptide cleavage site, might be critical for the cell\u2013cell fusion in VeroE6-APN cells. Specifically, a single amino acid substitution at position 672 in the RBD from valine to phenylalanine (V672F) could render PEDV S of a typical field isolate to mediate cell\u2013cell fusion in VeroE6-APN cells. Moreover, the recombinant PEDV bearing SG2 with V672F mutation also replicated efficiently in VeroE6-APN cells, while that harboring the wild-type SG2 grew poorly, thereby supporting the notion that the syncytium formation is likely associated with the high-growth characteristic of PEDV. It should be emphasized, however, that V672F was specific for syncytium induction in VeroE6 or VeroE6-APN cells. We showed that SYN144 carrying the RBD derived from SG2 could effectively induce syncytium in Huh-7, but not in VeroE6-APN cells. This finding thus points to the possibility that S might interact with different receptors on Huh-7 and VeroE6-APN cells. Given that pAPN has been recently shown to be unnecessary for PEDV entry [22,23,25], the functional PEDV receptor on Huh-7 cells is unlikely to be the human APN but may instead be some other surface protein(s) that might be absent in Vero or VeroE6 cells. Another important point worth mentioning is that all recombinant viruses that grew poorly in VeroE6-APN cells could replicate efficiently in Huh-7 cells. These results suggest that Huh-7 cells might be a more suitable host for isolating and propagating field-isolated PEDV than Vero or VeroE6 cells.",

Interestingly, F672 is also found in an early passage of YN144, YN15 (GenBank KT021228.1), which indicates that this specific residue is unlikely to be the result of adaptive mutations that occurred during serial passages. To the best of our knowledge, V672F has never been reported specifically as a mutation in cell-adapted strains. One cell-adapted strain, so-called LZW, was reported to carry F672 at passage 24 (GenBank AIJ01341), but it is not known whether this residue was also present in the original isolate. It is notable that while several cell-adapted PEDVs have been recently characterized and reported, common mutations in S that confer cell adaptation are not yet identified. For example, Zhou et al. have recently reported that A389S, P803H, Q825H, I1,010T, and C1,362G mutations in S of PEDV strain ZJ15XS0101 at passage 120 could enable the virus to replicate up to 10.125 log10 TCID50/mL in VeroE6 cells [31]. However, the same mutations were never reported in other known cell-adapted strains. We also demonstrated in this study that the recombinant virus bearing V672 showed slower growth kinetics than that with F672 in VeroE6-APN cells. It is thus likely that PEDV with F672 could be found in some natural isolates and these strains might be more efficiently propagated in Vero or VeroE6 cells when compared to those carrying S with V672.",
