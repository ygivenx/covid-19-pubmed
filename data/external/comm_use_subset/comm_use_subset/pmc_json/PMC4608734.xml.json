Realizing that fever and hypoferremia directly promote host defense (Box 1), Hart suggested that SB is primarily intended to serve these physiological adaptations. Specifically, he proposed that SB evolved to conserve energy needed to sustain metabolically demanding fever. Thus, immobility, lethargy, and reduced motivation to obtain food and drink could have developed to minimize muscle work and exposure to the cold. Anorexia, on the other hand, would promote hypoferremia by reducing iron intake. Other behaviors were viewed as subordinate to the primary ones that conserve energy and reduce iron. Reduced grooming, for example, could preserve fluids in the context of adipsia, whereas decreased foraging would protect a weak animal from predators.",

SB is definitely associated with reduced motivation for action\u2014and therefore with less energy expenditure. However, in many cases, fever and SB are decoupled, the one arising without the other [10]. In humans, for instance, malaise and fatigue often characterize mild infections that do not elicit fever. More importantly, several aspects of SB can actually tip the energy balance in the wrong direction. Confinement to nests and dens does not always conserve heat. In warmer climates, dens are cooler than the outside environment and mobility increases body temperature, yet desert animals still remain inside [10]. Another counterproductive symptom is reduced grooming. When mammals and birds stop grooming, their fur and plumage gradually lose their insulating efficiency, requiring more energy to maintain fever [41,42].",

It seems unlikely, though, that evolution would favor an indiscriminate reduction in food intake just to decrease iron consumption.

Similar changes may affect vocal communication. In sparrows, for instance, the frequency and pattern of birdsong change during an inflammatory response [74]. Lastly, the stereotypic posture and motion that infected animals adopt because of fatigue and hyperalgesia can act as additional cues. Thus, LPS-treated subjects can be detected by observers based on their gait [75]. The signaling aspects of such behavioral changes are exposed by the response of sick animals to predators. Under the gaze of carnivores, sick members of a herd would attempt to disguise their vulnerability and suppress SB [14]. This observation suggests that animals can alert their kin of infection but suppress such signaling to predators.",
