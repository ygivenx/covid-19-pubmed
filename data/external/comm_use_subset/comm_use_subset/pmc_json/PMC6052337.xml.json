            "text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human pathogen that results in lifelong persistence, with more than 90% seroconversion in the adult population (1). EBV infects epithelial cells and B-lymphocytes, maintaining a latent reservoir in circulating memory B-cells with sporadic reactivation and transmission from oral secretions (2). Unlicensed replication in B-cells can manifest clinically as infectious mononucleosis, while productive replication in epithelial cells can be associated with immune suppression in AIDS patients in a disease known as oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) (3). Latent infection is linked to all forms of EBV-associated cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (1, 4, 5). EBV genomes are typically not integrated in the host cell, existing as circular episomal genomes in latently infected cells or as linear genomes in lytically replicating cells (6). During latency, the variable numbers of terminal repeats at the ends of the EBV genome fuse to produce uniquely sized BamHI-digested bands, which can be analyzed by Southern blotting in a termini assay to differentiate the states of infection (latent versus lytic and polyclonal versus monoclonal) (7). The state of EBV genomes in NPC tumors is latent and monoclonal, strongly supporting the hypothesis that EBV infection is present at the inception of neoplastic transformation (7, 8). Expression of the EBV oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) in epithelial cells and rat-1 fibroblasts can promote oncogenic properties, including anchorage-independent growth and increased motility, and can also result in the formation of tumors in nude mice (8\u201312). Despite the association with oncogenic properties, it has been more difficult to elucidate the early events that lead to the establishment of latency and infection persistence in NPC (5, 13\u201315). The development of a robust in vitro method to mimic differentiation-induced lytic reactivation in polarized epithelia, in primary or immortalized airway epithelial cell lines, could significantly advance our interrogation of EBV pathogenesis in preneoplastic mechanisms.",

            "text": "The conventional method to reactivate EBV is by chemical induction with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and protein kinase C inhibitors (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate [TPA] and sodium butyrate) (6, 16). Alternatively, the lytic cascade can be triggered by transfecting the immediate early gene product zebra and late glycoprotein gB (6, 17). However, these methods do not recapitulate differentiation-induced reactivation and, depending on the cell line, can be abortive without production of progeny virus to appreciable titers (16, 18, 19). Moreover, not all cell lines are efficiently transfected and chemical induction inadvertently affects global host and viral epigenetics. The organotypic raft culture model established for studies in human papillomavirus (HPV) replication was recently applied to trigger EBV reactivation, resulting in the efficient production of infectious progeny virus that spreads in stratified primary keratinocytes (20). The organotypic raft culture can also be applied to the study of EBV infection in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized keratinocyte cell lines but is not always as robust a model for viral spread (21). One of the triumphs of the organotypic raft model for the study of EBV reactivation is that it is amenable to many standard DNA/RNA/protein molecular virology techniques evaluated either at the population level or at single-cell resolution by immunostaining and imaging methods (22). Nonetheless, the organotypic raft culture method selects for keratinocytes and is not yet a widely adopted technique. A method that can be applied to additional epithelial cell types and could be readily adopted for widespread use is the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method, which is conventionally used to polarize primary airway epithelial cells of nasal or bronchial origin (23, 24).",

Once an intact epithelium is established, the apical medium is removed and cells are fed through a porous membrane from the basolateral surface (Fig. 1A). Originally, the ALI method was used to establish pseudostratified cultures of primary airway epithelial cells with apical cilia and basolateral nuclei, which can preserve the diversity of cell types resembling native airway epithelium (23, 24). The ALI method can also be applied to immortalized cell lines (26, 27). ALI culture conditions have been routinely used for both primary and immortalized cells to study the pathogenesis of airway microbial pathogens (27, 28). Several studies have used the ALI method to define EBV infection parameters in polarized epithelia (26, 29, 30). However, only the organotypic raft culture has undeniably demonstrated that infection of stratified keratinocytes yields a permissive and productive infection (18, 20). While those few studies have been recognized as crucial and complementary, these intricate culture methods have yet to be widely adopted (31\u201333).",

The HK1 cell line, described as having originated from a differentiated NPC tumor biopsy specimen and infected with a recombinant (Akata) EBV strain, was amenable to ALI-induced culture conditions (38, 40). Lytic reactivation was then monitored by assessing lytic gene induction, EBV genome replication, and the production of infectious progeny virus. The results of this study demonstrate that the ALI method is proficient at reactivating EBV from the established HK1-EBV cell line, yielding high titers (~106 packaged genome equivalents per ALI culture [1.12 cm2]) that are secreted and infectious, thus providing an alternative method to interrogate EBV permissive replication from polarized epithelia in an established NPC-derived cell line and allowing the elucidation of EBV pathogenesis in nasal epithelia.",

The primary biopsy specimen was too small for EBV DNA analysis, but the outgrowing HK1 cell line did not show evidence of EBV infection as determined by staining for EBNA1 or by imaging of virus particles (40). The HK1-EBV cell line was established by in vitro infection of a recombinant EBV originating from the EBV Akata strain (38). In proliferating monolayer cultures, the EBV-infected HK1 cell line does not show induction of the lytic cascade and expresses a type II latency profile characterized by the expression of EBNA1, EBER1/2, LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B, and BART transcripts (38). In this cell line, expression of lytic genes can be induced by the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) but is primarily abortive and does not yield progeny virus (16). Epithelial differentiation is a physiological trigger for EBV reactivation and can be induced by culturing cells at the air-liquid interface (32). Therefore, the HK1-EBV cell line was tested using the ALI epithelial cell polarization method for EBV reactivation and the timeline presented in Fig. 1B. Upon removal of apical media, harvest time points begin 1 day after lifting to the air-liquid interface (denoted week 0) and at weekly intervals for a total of 3 weeks. One additional hTERT-immortalized nasopharyngeal cell line (NP460hTERT-EBV) and one natively infected NPC cell line (C666-1) were also evaluated (37\u201339), but only the HK1-EBV cell line could be maintained under ALI growth conditions and could preserve an intact epithelium under polarized conditions (data not shown).",

Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for expression of immediate early protein zebra, early protein EaD, and the late viral capsid antigen (VCA) p18 protein, as well as the cellular differentiation markers involucrin, keratin 10, and filaggrin (Fig. 2A). Although the HK1 cell line is described as having originated from a differentiated squamous carcinoma biopsy, involucrin was not evident in monolayer culture but was robustly induced in ALI culture, consistent with the hypothesis that the ALI method triggers terminal differentiation. At early time points, involucrin and keratin 10 levels were induced as early as day 1, corresponding to induction of the EBV immediate early switch protein zebra (Fig. 2A). Processed filaggrin levels were not affected and were weak, requiring long exposures, which may reflect the low abundance and variable detection in nasal mucosa (41, 42). The induction of involucrin was strongest in EBV-infected HK1 cells compared to uninfected cells, but both the infected and uninfected cell lines displayed consistent induction of involucrin and keratin 10, supporting the idea that ALI culture triggers differentiation (Fig. 2A). In comparison to the undetectable levels in monolayer culture, the EBV zebra, EaD, and VCA p18 proteins were induced beginning at week 1 to week 2 post-ALI culture (Fig. 2A). Moreover, chemical induction by treatment with TPA and sodium butyrate in monolayer culture triggered lytic reactivation but did not result in the production of progeny virus as determined by the green Raji unit (GRU) assay (Fig. 2A; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). Late lytic proteins, particularly glycoproteins, are notoriously difficult to probe by immunoblotting; therefore, expression of EBV zebra and EaD and of an additional late glycoprotein, gp350, was also analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. Nuclear staining of EBV zebra and EaD proteins and the cytoplasmic staining of gp350 further support the induction of the lytic cascade (Fig. 2B). Cells that stain positively for gp350 represent cells that have completed induction of the lytic cascade. Only sporadic cells stained positively for gp350 in monolayer culture when reactivated with TPA and sodium butyrate (Fig. 2C). However, gp350-positive cells were much more frequently detected in ALI-cultured cells (~25% to 40%) and were often detected as a group of cells in focal areas of staining (Fig. 2C). These data support the idea that the ALI culture method is more efficient at completing induction of the lytic cascade than chemical reactivation in monolayer culture.",

EBERs are noncoding nuclear transcripts that are abundantly expressed in all EBV-associated cancers and latencies, with up to 106 copies per cell in B-cell infections (43). Therefore, the abundant expression of EBERs is exploited for the diagnosis of EBV-associated cancers and diseases by EBER in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) (44). One understanding of EBER function is that EBER2 can serve as a ribonucleoprotein complex to recruit DNA binding proteins to the terminal repeats on the EBV genome (45). The only disease pathology known to be associated with permissive replication in epithelial infection is the AIDS-associated nonmalignant lesion known as OHL that manifests on tongue and gingival tissues (3, 32, 44). Paradoxically, EBER transcripts are suppressed and sometimes not detected in OHL formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, which has called into question the function of EBERs during EBV reactivation (46, 47). The diagnosis of OHL may require secondary confirmation by staining for zebra (48). The presence of highly abundant EBER transcripts detected in the ALI culture method is consistent with the recent discovery that EBER transcripts are also detected by EBER-ISH throughout the layers of the stratified epithelium in organotypic raft cultures, which would suggest that EBERs are indeed expressed during EBV reactivation in the differentiated apical layers (20). These findings, combined with observations from the present study, would seem to imply that the suppression of EBERs may be unique to OHL.",

Raji cells are a Burkitt lymphoma cell line that can be readily superinfected with EBV, but the endogenous EBV genome is truncated and will not replicate, thus enabling the determination of the titers of ALI culture-derived green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing virus (49, 50). Overall titers, including extracellular and cell-associated virus titers, increased from week 0 to week 3. Extracellular virus titers were consistently 2 log10 higher than cell-associated virus titers, as would be expected from immature cell-associated virions. By week 3, there was a total value of 1,675,933 GRUs per ALI, demonstrating that abundant and infectious EBV virions were produced (Fig. 5A). This increase at week 3 was ~30-fold higher than the values measured at week 0, when production of progeny virus began. In comparison to the ALI culture results, no infectious units were measured in uninduced HK1-EBV monolayer-cultured cells (Table S1). Despite the expected loss of sample from Hirt purification, at week 2 to 3 of ALI culture there were 3.0 \u00d7 106 to 4.3 \u00d7 106 DNase-resistant encapsidated EBV genomes per ALI culture (1.12 cm2), which corresponds to 1.425 \u00d7 106 to 1.676 \u00d7 106 total GRUs per ALI culture (Fig. 4A and 5A).

Although extracellular virions are largely washed away during TEM processing, intracellular virions can be captured. The TEM images show an encapsidated herpesvirus-like virion of 200 to 250 nm and two immature virions in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). Additionally, 1 to 2 cells layers were observed in the TEM images, illustrating that the HK1-EBV ALI cultures were polarized but not necessarily stratified (Fig. 5B), which is representative of the pseudostratified differentiated ALI cultures of primary nasal epithelia (24). These data support the idea that the ALI method is a robust method for inducing fulminant EBV lytic reactivation without the need for chemical induction. The outcome of this study from an NPC-derived cell line perhaps appears to contradict the observation of latent infection in NPC tumors (7). Given that there was no evidence of EBV infection in the original NPC biopsy specimen from which HK1 cells were derived, it is plausible that the outcome of infection might differ from that seen with NPC tumor cells that have evolved to sustain latent infection in vivo (40). Despite the paucity of authenticated NPC cell lines, it would be interesting to test additional NPC cell lines that originate from tumors with confirmed EBV positivity (34). Furthermore, since HK1 cells can be recombinantly modified and stably selected, the HK1-EBV ALI culture model offers the potential to test host and viral factors which may predispose a neoplastic cell to EBV latent infection (25, 38). The ALI polarization culture method has been established for primary nasal epithelial cells (24). Furthermore, EBV infection as defined by the presence of latent or lytic markers is not detected in nasal biopsy specimens of histologically normal areas, likely reflecting rare or focal airway epithelial infections in asymptomatic carriers (51, 52). Due to the absence of detection of EBV infection in situ from nasal biopsy specimens of healthy tissue, in theory it is possible to study de novo EBV infection in ALI-cultured primary nasal epithelial cells. Ultimately, the creation of an EBV infection model and analytical methods to study (widespread or focal) infection in polarized ALI cultures of primary nasal epithelial cells would be the most relevant system to evaluate EBV de novo infection in mucociliated epithelia (53). Given the limited availability of primary nasal cells, the ALI culture method described for the HK1-EBV cell line thus offers a widely accessible alternative for the study of EBV permissive replication in polarized epithelia.",

            "text": "To date, there have been a few exemplar studies that have explored the effect of EBV proteins on differentiation, or differentiation-induced effects on EBV infection (18, 54\u201356). These experimental models include calcium-induced differentiation, suspension of cells in methylcellulose, and organotypic raft cultures (57). Keratinocytes grown in monolayer can be induced to differentiate by high levels of calcium, which has been applied to EBV studies by treatment with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and/or by the direct addition of calcium (18, 21, 56). A second method to differentiate keratinocytes is by suspending cells in methylcellulose, which has been applied to the study of EBV-infected cells and of the effect of the EBV latent protein, LMP2A, on differentiation (21, 57). The methylcellulose method can recapitulate differentiation in a three-dimensional (3D) culture model, but the analysis of these cells in a semisolid matrix is often limited to protein lysates harvested from the cell population (21, 57). Organotypic rafts provide single-cell resolution by formalin-fixed paraffin-embedding (FFPE) sectioning and staining and serve as a robust model for culturing fully stratified squamous keratinocytes, but the keratinocyte-enriching media used to establish organotypic rafts may not culture all NPC cell types (22). In principle, organotypic rafts, originally established for the study of EBV infection in oral keratinocytes, can also be developed for nasal keratinocytes (18, 20). The ALI culture method ultimately extends the application of polarization to other epithelial cell types. When applied to primary cells, ALI culture preserves the diversity of cell types represented in airway epithelium, including ciliated, mucosecretory, and basal cells (22). The ALI method described in this study for an NPC cell line (HK1) permits the analysis of protein expression at the population level but also with single-cell resolution (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the ALI culture method, as in the use of organotypic rafts, is amenable to a variety of molecular virology analytical techniques, including those involving DNA, RNA, protein, imaging, and the collection of infectious virus. Therefore, ALI culture is a method complementary to the use of organotypic rafts that can model EBV infection for the additional cell types represented in polarized airway epithelium.",

A total of 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells are seeded on thin-coat collagen-coated polyester membrane transwells (Corning) (0.4 \u00b5m pore size, 12-mm diameter) in 0.5 ml apical medium. Cells are fed from the basolateral surface with 1 ml of media used for the propagation of HK1 cells (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). Thin-coat collagen is prepared by diluting 0.1 mg/ml stock of fibrous collagen (IV) from human placenta (Sigma) in water supplemented with 200 \u00b5l glacial acetic acid (100% [vol/vol]), with rocking overnight at 4\u00b0C to facilitate solubility. The stock collagen solution is sterile filtered and further diluted 1:10 in 0.1 M Na2CO3 to a working concentration. Collagen stocks can be aliquoted and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C, but diluted stocks should be made fresh. For a 12-well plate, 250 \u00b5l of the collagen working stock is used to coat the apical surface of the transwell at 37\u00b0C for a minimum of 30 min and up to 1 h. Before the cells are seeded, the collagen solution is aspirated and gently rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At 1 to 2 days postseeding, a confluent layer should form. The apical medium is removed, and the basolateral medium is replenished. Beginning as early as the next day, a successful ALI culture is established when there is no medium leakage into the apical surface, and that day is noted as day zero. Cells at the ALI are fed twice a week from the basolateral compartment and cultured for up to 3 additional weeks. The uninfected cells should have minimal apical leakage over the 3-week period and should be gently removed at every feeding. The ALI culture of EBV-infected cells increasingly disrupts the monolayer, and apical leakage is expected to increase over the 3-week period, but the integrity of the monolayer should still be apparent by visual inspection with phase microscopy.",

Reaction mixtures were assembled with a Maxima SYBR green qPCR master mix kit (Thermo Scientific) with 0.3 \u00b5M of each primer, using recommended cycle conditions with ROX as a passive reference dye in a total reaction volume of 10 \u00b5l. Primer sequences are as follows: for qBALF5-F, 5\u2032 GAGCGATCTTGGCAATCTCT 3\u2032; for qBALF5-R, 5\u2032 TGGTCATGGATCTGCTAAACC 3\u2032. Reactions were amplified on a StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with StepOne software (v2.3). Average values and standard deviations were calculated from triplicate technical replicas and three independent experiments. Water and uninfected HK1 ALI culture cells from corresponding weeks were used as negative controls. End values were represented as BALF5 copy number per ALI culture.",
