Compared to\nother laboratory animals, spontaneous pathology of common marmosets is less\nwell defined. Background lesions of the common marmoset in toxicological\nstudies have previously been documented by Kaspareit et al. (2006), who also\nreferred to pulmonary findings. David et al. (2009) also performed a\nretrospective study on the spontaneous pathology of common marmosets\nincluding the morphological diagnoses of pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary\nextramedullary hematopoiesis, and lymphosarcoma in the lungs. However, a\ndetailed survey about the range and incidence of lung pathology in common\nmarmosets does not exist in the literature so far.",

Archived material\nincluded formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded lung tissue, or histological\nsections of the lung, which were collected between 1997 and 2011. Animals of\nthis study were housed in small family groups in an indoor facility with a\nroom temperature of 25 \u2218C and relative humidity of 50\u201360 % on a\n12 h light\u2013dark cycle with 30 min \u201cdawn\u201d and \u201cdusk\u201d periods. Care\nand housing conditions of the animals complied with the regulations of the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council Directive on the protection of animals\nused for scientific purposes (2010/63/EU), the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2010), and the applicable\nGerman Animal Protection Law. According to necropsy records, animals\nunderwent necropsy after spontaneous death, following euthanasia due to\nillness with poor prognosis, or after scheduled terminal kill in the context\nof experimental studies. From the latter group of marmosets only control\nanimals or animals without treatment-related findings were considered for\nre-evaluation of lung histology. Photographic documentation of respective\nmacroscopic pulmonary findings and results from bacteriological culture of\nthe lungs were available for some animals. Lung tissue samples were fixed in\n4 or 10 % phosphate-buffered formaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at\n3 \u00b5m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). If required for\ndiagnostic purposes, additional stains were prepared and analyzed, including\nperiodic acid Schiff (PAS) reaction, Prussian blue stain, von Kossa stain,\nMasson's trichrome stain, Congo red stain, Grocott's methenamine silver stain,\nand Giemsa stain. The lungs of all 638 marmosets were re-examined\nhistologically, and findings were reported on a spreadsheet (Microsoft\nOffice Excel 2010) with searchable columns for morphological\ndiagnosis/histological finding, sex, age, cause of death (if known),\nchronicity of lesion (in case of inflammation), and severity grade. Animals\nwere assigned to three age groups: newborn (0 to 7 days old, including\nsupposedly timely delivered but stillborn marmosets), juvenile (7 days to 30\nmonths old), and adult (older than 30 months). Histological findings were\ngrouped into inflammatory conditions, neoplasia, changes in air content,\ncirculatory disturbances, pigment deposition, and miscellaneous findings.\nTotal incidences of findings were indicated in absolute numbers and\npercentage. In addition, absolute numbers of findings were calculated for\nmales and females as well as different age groups.",

Regarding severity and distributional pattern, mild multifocal\nor multifocal to coalescing forms predominated (Fig. 1), while severe and\ndiffuse cases were very rare.

            "text": "With an incidence of 32.99 %, the most common inflammatory condition in\nthe lungs was interstitial pneumonia. However, the majority of cases were\nmild and were not associated with severe clinical disease or death. Except\nfor a few case reports, published data on the incidence of interstitial\npneumonias in common marmoset colonies are lacking. David et al. (2009)\nobserved pneumonias in 9 of 597 marmosets but did not provide further\nclassification of this diagnosis. The etiopathogenesis of interstitial\npneumonia generally includes aerogenous damage to the alveolar epithelium\n(e.g., by toxic gases or due to infection with pneumotropic viruses) or\nhematogenous injury to the alveolar capillary endothelium or basement\nmembrane (e.g., in septicemia, by endotoxins from the alimentary tract, from\nfree radicals released in acute respiratory distress syndrome, from\nmicroembolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation, in the context of\nhypersensitivity reactions, or due to infection with endotheliotropic\nviruses) (L\u00f3pez, 2007). In the common marmosets affected by interstitial\npneumonia, testing for respiratory viruses was not performed routinely.\nTherefore, a viral etiology accounting for at least a part of interstitial\npneumonias cannot finally be excluded. Evidence of bacterial agents was\npresent in only a few cases, including Streptococcus sp.,\nEscherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.\nThese isolates are of variable pathogenicity regarding respiratory\ninfections but are usually not associated with interstitial pneumonia\n(Simmons and Gibson, 2012). In some marmosets, bacterial isolates were also\nobtained from other organs (gall bladder, intestine) with evidence of\nbacteria-induced pathologic lesions suggesting septicemic distribution of\nthe respective bacteria. Mycotic interstitial pneumonia was observed in one\nmarmoset with systemic candidiasis, which represents the most frequently\noccurring mycotic disease in immunocompromised non-human primates (Simmons\nand Gibson, 2012). However, the etiology of the majority of interstitial\npneumonias remains unclear. Environmental influences linked to the housing\nconditions of the marmoset colony \u2013 e.g., room temperature, humidity, air\nexchange rate and air filter specifications, and aerosol formation \u2013 may\nrepresent predisposing or triggering factors for the development of\ninterstitial lung inflammation in captive marmosets, although evidence for\nthis assumption is lacking. In addition, fine dust pollution has to be\nconsidered as an initiating factor for interstitial lung disease, especially\nwith regard to the atmospheric composition in the natural habitat of common\nmarmosets, which surely differs from the artificial conditions in indoor\nmarmoset husbandry. The presence of anthracosis in 52 marmosets (8.15 %)\npoints to at least partial exposure of indoor-kept marmosets to the\noutside air. However, the association between anthracosis and interstitial\npneumonia remains questionable as many animals with intrapulmonary coal dust\npigment did not exhibit obvious interstitial inflammation or fibrosis, which\nis consistent with observations in cynomolgus monkeys (Sato et al., 2012).\nFinally, influences like stress or immunological status of the animal, both\nconditions that are hard to grasp, may have an impact on the individual's\ndisposition to develop interstitial lung inflammation (L\u00f3pez, 2007).",

Subpleural mineralization\nmacroscopically presented as subpleural plaques, which are distinctly\nvisible at necropsy. Both interstitial and subpleural mineralization was\nfound in 70 marmosets (10.97 %) and was largely regarded to be of\nmetastatic origin as there was co-existing mineralization of other tissues\nwith accentuation on basal lamina structures. Taking into consideration that\nthe diet for young marmosets in the German Primate Center is supplemented\nwith vitamin D to prevent rachitic lesions, soft tissue mineralization in\nthe common marmosets was likely due to hypervitaminosis D, which is a\nwell-known nutritional disease entity in New World monkeys (Hunt, 1969;\nKaspareit et al., 2006; McInnes, 2012; Saravanan et al., 2015).\nCircumscribed areas of interstitial and subpleural fibrosis occurred in 23\njuvenile and adult marmosets (3.61 %) and presumably represent residua\nfrom earlier tissue damage. Mononuclear inflammatory cell foci, which were\npresent in 66 marmoset lungs (10.34 %), are a regularly observed\nbackground finding in common marmosets and may affect different organ\nsystems (Chamanza et al., 2006; Kaspareit et al., 2006). In the lungs, it is\nimportant to distinguish between such inflammatory cell foci and\ninterstitial pneumonia, which should be feasible regarding the extent,\ndistribution, and severity of infiltrating inflammatory cells. The\nhistological features of pulmonary arteriopathy observed in 3 adult\nmarmosets (0.47 %) were indicative of pulmonary hypertension, and\nconcurrent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was present in at least one of the\naffected animals. However, the exact pathogenetic mechanisms leading to\npulmonary arteriopathy remained obscure in the common marmosets. Occasional\noccurrence of foreign-body granulomas in marmoset lungs has previously been\nreported by Kaspareit et al. (2006). They are usually caused by aspiration\nof foreign material (hair, food particles, plant fragments) (Sato et al.,\n2012). When small and focal as in the present case, they can be regarded as\nincidental microscopic findings without clinical relevance. However,\naspiration of larger or sharp-edged foreign bodies may result in substantial\ntissue reaction and respiratory distress. Tissue migration may lead to\ncomplications like abscess formation, pneumo- or pyothorax, or signs of\npenetration of other organs (L\u00f3pez, 2007).",
