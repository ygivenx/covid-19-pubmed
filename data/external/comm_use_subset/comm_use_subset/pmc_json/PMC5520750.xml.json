In healthy neurons, the tau protein is enriched in the axon, a distribution facilitated, at least in part, by the axon initial segment (AIS). Tau accumulation in the cell body due to disruption of the AIS barrier is potentially a contributing factor to AD pathogenesis. Very little is known about the effects of normal aging on AIS proteins or levels and localization of tau. Here, we report that there were no changes in the AIS or tau localization with increasing age in rats, suggesting disease-specific effects may drive changes in these factors during AD pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of individuals over the age of 65, and affects over 6.4 million adults in the United States (James et al., 2014). The leading risk factor for developing the disease is aging, and while the cause of AD is still unclear, the accumulation of inclusions comprised of tau protein is a hallmark of the disease (Santuccione et al., 2013). It remains unclear whether changes in the distribution of tau that are reminiscent of AD-related changes, such as accumulation in the somatodendritic compartment, occur during normal aging. Aged Fischer 344 rats are commonly used for aging research and exhibit age-related behavioral deficits of learning and memory as well as motor impairment (Spangler et al., 1994; van der Staay and Blokland, 1996; Cochran et al., 2014). Additionally, aging causes altered neuronal protein expression, axonal atrophy, and some gliosis in the F344 rat model (Parhad et al., 1995). For example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is shown to increase significantly in the hippocampus (HP) of aged rats both with and without cognitive impairment (VanGuilder et al., 2011). Thus, Fischer 344 rats are a good model to recapitulate factors of human aging (van der Staay and Blokland, 1996) and determining whether aging effects the AIS and tau distribution. The underlying hypothesis is that aging causes alterations in AIS integrity and tau mislocalization, which may represent events that contribute to aging as a strong risk factor for AD.",

Age-related accumulations of tau were reported in some nonhuman primate brains (Oikawa et al., 2010; Perez et al., 2013), yet systematic analysis of the cellular localization of tau accumulation across aging is not well studied. Unfortunately, human tissue studies are often limited in scope across age groups making it hard to appreciate changes from young to old age. In healthy neurons, tau is enriched in the axonal compartment, where it may stabilize microtubules and play a role in regulating axonal functions such as transport (Tytell et al., 1984; Binder et al., 1986; Kanaan et al., 2013). The redistribution of tau from the axonal compartment to the somatodendritic compartment is thought of as an important event in tau-mediated neurotoxicity (Buee et al., 2000). The preferential localization of tau in axons is mediated, at least in part, by the axon initial segment (AIS), which acts as a retrograde barrier for freely diffusing tau (Li et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2014; Zempel and Mandelkow, 2014; Sohn et al., 2016).",

The AIS is a selective diffusion barrier separating the axonal compartment from the somatodendritic compartment (Winckler et al., 1999). The establishment of the AIS creates a filter that regulates intracellular traffic based on protein size or the type of motor proteins carrying cargo along microtubules (Song et al., 2009; Leterrier and Dargent, 2014). Ankyrin G (AnkG) is well established as a necessary protein for the development and maintenance of the AIS as a selective filter, as well as a necessary protein for developing and maintaining axonal polarity (Zhou et al., 1998; Hedstrom et al., 2008). AnkG also has an integral role in recruiting and binding structural proteins to the AIS, such as \u03b2IV-spectrin and neurofascin (Hedstrom et al., 2007; Freal et al., 2016). Interestingly, a single previous report showed that some structural proteins in the AIS (specifically ankyrin) are reduced with age in wild-type mice (Bahr et al., 1994). Thus, we set out to determine if the structure of the AIS and/or tau localization is altered during normal aging. Our data show that AIS structure, levels of multiple AIS proteins, and the distribution of tau in HP neurons are not altered with advancing age in Fischer 344 rats.",

Image stacks (0.5 \u00b5m step size) were acquired of neurons in each HP region (CA1, CA2, CA3, and the dentate gyrus) using acquisition settings in the linear range of fluorescent intensity without saturation of tau signal and the same acquisition settings were used for all animals. Four image stacks were acquired per animal. The neurons were analyzed with NIS Elements (v4.30, Advanced Research, Nikon). The average intensity of Tau7 immunofluorescent signal was measured in the soma of individual pyramidal neurons in all CA regions (CA1, CA2, and CA3). Cells were chosen as randomly as possible, but only cells with an entire cross-section through the middle of the cell (i.e., the z-slice with the largest nuclear width) within the acquired z-stack and without overlapping cell bodies were used for analysis. To increase the rigor of this analysis, the experimenter was blinded to the condition of the samples. A box (\u223c8-12 \u00b5m2) was drawn as large as possible inside the somatic compartment of each neuron, excluding the DAPI-positive nuclei. The mean value of fluorescence intensity was measured for each box within a total of 180 cells/animal/group. The density and small cytoplasm of dentate granule cells precludes the ability to reliably measure signal intensity within individual cells. Instead, the average fluorescence intensity within a rectangular box (\u223c5000 \u00b5m2; six boxes/animal/group) was used to perform a regional analysis of immunofluorescence signal intensity within the dentate gyrus (Fig. 3F-I).",

The axonal enrichment of tau may deteriorate during the pathogenesis of AD as tau appears to accumulate in the somatodendritic compartment. Considering that aging is the leading risk factor for AD, investigation into the normal aging process may lead to the discovery of previously unappreciated anomalous features that contribute to disease vulnerability. Thus, we investigated the integrity of the AIS, the barrier involved in maintaining axonal localization of tau, over the span of aging in rats to establish whether normal aging might affect the AIS structure and/or tau distribution.",

However, we found no evidence that the levels of AIS proteins or tau proteins change with age in the HP, nor levels of somatic or axonal tau change in HP neurons with advancing age in rats. The length of the AIS was not found to change in any region of the HP, but a discrete and specific effect was detected in the CA2 region (\u223c8% decrease from young to old). The reduction of AIS volume and diameter without a change in length indicates possible atrophy the axonal projections specifically in CA2 neurons, but biological significance of these changes in the context of tau distribution and AIS functionality remain unclear. Overall, the findings presented here provide a strong case against aging-related changes in the total tau levels, somatic tau levels, some phosphorylated forms of tau (i.e., PHF1, AT8, pS422), levels of AIS structural proteins (i.e., AnkG, neurofascin, \u03b2IV-spectrin), or AIS morphology within the HP, thus, these factors are unlikely to contribute to the risk of developing AD. Importantly, these findings do not rule out that other variables related to tau and/or the AIS (e.g., other forms of tau, other characteristics/functions of the AIS, etc.) are changed during normal aging and might contribute to susceptibility for AD.",

Since tau is a microtubule-associated protein, we wanted to establish whether changes in tubulin content was altered with advancing age, but there were no age-related changes in total tubulin levels and the amount of tau per tubulin remained constant within the HP, which aligns well with previous studies showing HP neurons are not lost in normal aging (both in humans and in rats; West et al., 2004; Stanley et al., 2012).

Multiple key AIS proteins (AnkG, \u03b2IV-spectrin, and neurofascin) were examined in Western blottings, and we measured SMI312 levels to determine if total axonal content was changed. The lack of aging changes in all AIS proteins assessed and SMI312 suggest that axonal content and key structural components of the AIS are not altered with age. This conclusion is further supported by the lack of changes in tubulin described above. Stereological analysis of the AIS was conducted using two complementary approaches. The space balls probe is an established methodology for detecting aging-related changes in fiber structures within the brain (Ypsilanti et al., 2008), and here we used it to measure AIS length. The AutoNeuron method in Neurolucida was used to perform 3D measurements of individual AISs and showed a lack of age-related changes in AIS length and only a mild, region-specific decrease in width and volume. This probe has been used previously to measure the diameter of dendrites in pyramidal neurons and compare them across brain regions (Amatrudo et al., 2012).The unbiased stereological measurement of AIS length in the entire HP is a significant advantage of this approach to analyze AIS morphology. The length of the AIS was previously measured with \u03b2IV-spectrin using a nonstereological method in selected z-stacks of the HP (Baalman et al., 2013). Interestingly, they report that a shortening of AISs correlates to cognitive impairment following explosion-induced brain trauma in Sprague Dawley rats. This work suggests that a shortening of the AIS may correlate to cognitive impairment, but we did not detect a shortening of AISs with age in the current work. Collectively, these data strongly demonstrate that the gross structure of the AIS (i.e., length, diameter, volume) do not change during the normal aging process in most cells of the HP.",

For example, an age-related decline in learning ability at 24 months of age was observed using a 14-unit T-maze and shock-motivated one-way active avoidance test in Fischer 344 rats (Spangler et al., 1994). Additionally, 24-month-old Fischer 344 rats exhibit pathologies in multiple organ systems associated with advanced aging, further supporting their utility as a model of aging.

Thus, future investigations should focus on alternative aspects of tau and the AIS to further identify whether aging-related changes may contribute to the risk of AD.",
