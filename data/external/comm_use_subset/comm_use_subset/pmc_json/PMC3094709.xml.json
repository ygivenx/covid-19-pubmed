The fundamental strategy for separating these compounds is based on their chemophysical properties that can be cleverly exploited to initially separate them into various chemical groups. However, from the literature search of the related genera and families, it is possible to predict the types of compounds that might be present in a particular extract. This tentative prediction on possible identity of the classes of compounds may help choose suitable extraction and partitioning methods and solvents for extracting specific classes of compounds. Plant natural products are usually extracted with solvents of increasing polarity [19]. The larger the variety of compounds that are extracted by the extractant, the better the chance that biologically active components will also be extracted if a specific class of chemical component is not targeted [20]. In this study, the use of a solvent for screening and for the isolation of active components was examined.",

Although, there are widespread reports about the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of some species of this genus, anticancer researches have not yet been conducted on S. litwinowii. Therefore, in an attempt it is sought to study the cytotoxic properties of S. litwinowii root extract on some common cancer cell lines including AGS, HeLa, MCF-7, PC12 and mouse embryo cell line (NIH 3T3) as non-malignant cells. AGS cell line was isolated from an adenocarcinoma of the stomach resected from a 54-year-old Caucasian female. In the USA, adenocarcinoma of the stomach is the seventh most common cause of cancer death [21]. HeLa cells are human epithelial cells from a fatal cervical carcinoma. The cell line was derived from cervical cancer cells taken from Henrietta Lacks, in 1951. It has been one of the most widely studied cell lines in cervical cancer, the second most frequent malignant tumor in women worldwide [22, 23]. MCF-7 is a human breast cancer cell line, which is known as a widely used model system for the study of breast cancer [24]. The PC12 cell line has been established from a transplantable rat adrenal pheochromocytoma and has been widely used to investigate neuronal cell death [25].",

The concentrated extract was then extracted with an equal volume of n-hexane, three times, to give a fraction containing non-polar compounds, such as lipids. The process is referred to as defatting.

Apoptotic cell death is known to be induced by many chemotherapeutic agents routinely used in cancer treatment regimens. Apoptosis is characterized by distinct morphological features including, chromatin condensation, cell and nuclear shrinkage, membrane blebbing and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis is an important homeostatic mechanism that balances cell division and cell death and maintains the appropriate number of cell in the body. In the present study, apoptosis was determined using PI staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak). It has been reported that DNA fragmentation creates small fragments of DNA that can be eluted following incubation in a hypotonic phosphate-citrate buffer. When stained with a quantitative DNA-binding dye such as PI, cells that have lost DNA will take up less stain and will appear to the left of the G1 peak [27, 28]. A balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis controls normal organ development [36\u201338]. The induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is considered a valuable way to treat cancer [39]. A wide variety of natural substances have been recognized to have the ability to induce apoptosis in various tumor cells. It is thus considered important to screen apoptotic inducers from plants, either in the form of crude extracts or as components isolated from them [6].",
