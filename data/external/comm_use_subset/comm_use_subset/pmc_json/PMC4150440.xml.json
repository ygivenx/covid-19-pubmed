Recent studies focused on development and functional diversity of innate immune cells have led to the reclassification of these cell types into a large group known as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) [1]. This is due to their origin from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) but unlike their T cell and B cell counterparts, they do not activate the recombination activation genes (RGA1/2) and do not undergo antigen receptor rearrangement. There are three main groups, Group 1, of which conventional NK cells are members, Group 2, and Group 3. Each grouping is based on the functionality and transcriptional regulation of cell type development. NK cells are members of group 1 ILCs due to their ability to produce IFN\u03b3 and be cytolytic. Their activation and function rely on recognition of pathogen-infected cells through activating receptors (KIRs in humans and Ly49 in mice) and proinflammatory cytokines. NK cells can also regulate immunity. During systemic infections they produce IL-10 and with high viremia can target DCs and T cells, thus modifying immunological memory [2\u20135]. As such, NK cells have many roles, in protection, in helping to maintain immune homeostasis, and in long term immunity.",

The review focuses on recent work and the current understanding of the regulation of mucosal tissue residency of NK cells and NK cell functional importance at mucosal sites relevant to both mouse and human systems.

CLPs in the mouse BM differentiate into a pre-NK precursor (pre-NKP) with a phenotype of Lin\u2212 CD117\u2212CD127+ and express some NK cell specific receptors including NKG2D and 2B4 (CD244) and negative for classical NK cell markers NK1.1 and CD49b. Pre-NKP then express the \u03b2-chain receptor for IL-15 (CD122) and CD11b and are now defined to be NK precursors (NKP). IL-15 is a cytokine required for their development as shown by IL-15 KO mice, which predominantly lack NK cells [9]. Interestingly, infection of IL-15 KO mice with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii or IL-15 KO, IL-15R\u03b1 KO, and RAG2/IL-2R\u03b3 KO mice with MCMV infection results in rapid expansion of NK cells [10, 11]. These studies support IL-15 as an important cytokine for promoting NK cell development in the absence of infection. However, they demonstrate that other non-\u03b3-chain cytokines such as IL-12 during infection can stimulate NK expansion and activity independent of IL-15. Once CD122 is expressed, NKPs now become responsive to IL-15 and develop further into immature NK cells (iNK) marked by CD27lo  CD11blo and the progressive expression of activating and inhibitory receptors. Murine NK cells have been further defined based on the expression of CD27 and CD11b into 4 stages of maturation that correspond with their production of inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic activity [12, 13]. After the iNK stage they progress in phenotype from the CD27lo  CD11blo to CD27hi  CD11blo then from CD27hi  CD11bhi to CD27lo  CD11bhi.",

            "text": "10% of total lung resident lymphocytes are NK cells. This is a higher NK cell number than other nonlymphoid organs highlighting their importance in this tissue [24]. They are primarily found along with other lymphocytes in the lung epithelium and vascular tissues [24, 25]. In humans, lung resident NK cells are CD56dim\u2061 CD16+ and mostly NKp46+ similar to NK cells in the blood suggesting a mature phenotype capable of being cytotoxic and producing cytokines [26]. In mice the more mature NK cell phenotype is found in the lung epithelium, which is CD27lo  CD11bhi, very similar in function to the human subset. In the na\u00efve state, these two phenotypes of NK cells in both human and mouse compose 80\u201390% of all NK cells present in the lung tissue [13, 25]. The maturation status of most lung NK cells resembles those from blood. However a recent study identified a population of NK cells in the lung capable of being further differentiated [27]. This study demonstrated that, unlike bone marrow precursors, the lung precursor cells when cultured in vitro expressed more Ly49 receptors. These results suggest that both mature and immature NK cells are present in the lung and that the murine lung microenvironment could condition NK cells separately from the bone marrow. In humans, other than classical NK cell marker phenotype (CD56 and CD16) approximately 30% of lung resident NK cells express KIRs including KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3, KIR3DL1 and KIR2DS2. Nearly 80% of the CD56bright population expressed CD94 similar to the phenotypes found in peripheral blood [26, 28]. Murine and human lung microenvironments may differ in their ability to modify resident NK cells. In humans support for tissue specific microenvironment conditioning of NK cells comes from studies of pulmonary sarcoidosis and non-small-cell lung cancer [26, 28]. NK cells express less KIR in bronchiolar lavage fluid (BALF) in these situations than in the na\u00efve state. Interestingly, peripheral blood NK cells also had lower KIR expression. Whether or not the change observed in BALF was from migrating cells is not known. The observations in BALF support a role for tissue specific microenvironment conditioning of NK cells. However, the more mature phenotype of resident NK cells in the lung is suggestive of a blood origin (Figure 1). Currently, much is still not known about the mechanisms behind these changes and whether in the healthy state tissue resident human NK cell phenotypes can be modified by the lung.",

NK cells are present in all gut tissues (small intestine, large intestine, and colon) as cells of the IEL and LP compartments. They can also be found in smaller numbers in Peyer's patches (PP) and MLNs. Unlike the lung, gut mucosal NK cells in humans are predominantly CD56bright with few that express CD16 indicating that they may be similar to immature NK cells found in secondary lymphoid structures [29\u201331]. NK cells in the murine intestinal mucosa also appear immature. IEL and LP NK cells of na\u00efve mice are CD27hiCD11bmed and CD27loCD11blo, respectively [32\u201334]. Further support for an immature phenotype for both murine and human gut NK cells is evident from functionality. Resident human CD56bright and mouse CD27hi NK cells produce large amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 and exhibit low cytolytic activity when tested in vitro [19, 31]. After infection, significant changes occur in NK cell frequencies in the small intestine and lamina propria. Whether peripheral NK cell infiltration occurs or whether there are phenotypic changes in resident NK cell populations has not been investigated. Infiltration of peripheral blood NK cells probably occurs albeit to a lesser extent and the NK cell dependent response may rely more on an NK cell interaction with activated gut mucosal DCs in the MLN and/or expansion of activated LP NK cells at the site of infection (Figure 2). However, given the diversity of gut mucosal ILC populations with wide ranging function, determining the level of infiltration of new cells may be very difficult.",

NK cells play an important role in not only host defense against pathogens, but also successful vascular remodeling of the uterus during pregnancy and fetal implantation [35, 36]. In humans, FRT NK cells resemble an immature phenotype of NK cells similar to that found in the digestive tract and are CD56brightCD16\u2212 [37]. NK cells found in the uterus are phenotypically distinct from others in the FRT being CD9+ and chemokine receptor like \u22121+ (CMKLR1). CD9 is a tetraspanin family member important for cell adhesion and migration and CMKLR1 is a receptor for chemerin, which promotes migration to the decidua and vascular remodeling during pregnancy [38, 39]. They are also positive for KIR molecules (KIR2DL4) and CD94/NKG2A. Uterine NK cells exhibit functional characteristics of immature NK cells having high cytokine production and low cytotoxic potential. Murine uterine NK cells resemble their human counterparts as having a more immature phenotype being CD27Med  CD11bHi [36]. They also express Ly49 receptors including Ly49D, H, C, I, G, and A. They are different from human uterine NK cells in that they exhibit lower cytolytic activity and are more important in contributing to vascular remodeling for proper fetal implantation [40].",

            "text": "An intriguing model behind how NK cells set up residency in different tissues has been recently proposed [8, 43, 44]. This model suggests that, unlike secondary lymphoid tissues and blood, NK precursor cells migrate from the BM into the blood then migrate further to different sites in the body including mucosal tissues. Once they have migrated, organ specific environments influence their development. Likely contributors include estrus cycling hormones, inflammatory milieu such as IL-15 by somatic cells, TGF\u03b2, IL-10, and the resident microbiomes. Factors from these sources could induce NK precursor differentiation to attain different levels of maturation and education. New data on tissue specific difference in NK cell differentiation and studies investigating whether NK cells can be differentiated from tissue specific precursors may support the hypothesis that NK precursor cells seed peripheral organs and that they differentiate independent of the bone marrow [27, 45]. This would allow these tissue resident NK cells to be \u201ceducated\u201d to have very specific functions important at sites to which they migrate [8].",

            "text": "An alternative hypothesis is possible. In certain mucosal tissues, especially those with established microbiomes, such as gut, FRT, and recently described in the lung [46], NK cells may require a priming event from draining APC populations. These APCs program LN NK cells in mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) to migrate to a specific site (Figure 2). MALT includes lymph nodes such as the mesenteric lymph node (MLN). This hypothesis is supported by the conserved phenotypic characteristics of gut and female reproductive tract NK cells. They more closely resemble immature cells by being CD56med-bright CD16+ and CD27+ CD11b+ with higher cytokine production in humans and mice, respectively. As mentioned above, lung NK cells resemble a more mature phenotype and could come directly from the peripheral blood (Figure 1). Despite the lung NK cell phenotype, the presence and the effect of the lung microbiome on the development of asthma and chronic inflammation suggest that NK cells could also be modified in situ. Regardless, support for the MALT APC priming hypothesis could be taken from the process of T cell (IEL) recruitment into the intestinal epithelium. Interactions between gut mucosal T cells and CD103+ DCs via CRTAM1 in both the steady state and during infection are required for recruitment [47]. IELs during pathogenic situations require IFN\u03b3 producing mucosal DCs to be primed to home to the gut [20]. Interestingly, a recent report demonstrates that small intestine IELs emerge from the thymus as recent thymic emigrants which express differing levels of the gut homing integrin \u03b14\u03b27 [22]. \u03b14\u03b27 is required for IEL trafficking to the gut [21]. Since NK precursors and other ILC populations in secondary lymphoid tissues express varying levels of this integrin, it may be possible that an NK-DC interaction is a requirement for immature NK cells to be signaled to home to mucosal sites. Altogether, this is a possible mechanism important for homing that would be interesting to explore.",

            "text": "The lung is a site of entry for viral, bacterial, and fungal infection. Of all nonlymphoid tissues, the lung contains the largest number of conventional NK cells. Humans and mice with genetic deficiencies resulting in loss of NK cells are more susceptible to pulmonary infections [50\u201352]. Many viruses including influenza, coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)), herpes, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infect via the airways. NK cells were demonstrated early to respond to influenza infection in the lungs of humans through their production of IFN\u03b3 [53]. Cytolytic activity of these cells is also important for control of influenza infection including pandemic H1N1 influenza [54]. NK cell CTL activity in response to influenza is mediated through antibodies and ADCC or via the recognition of viral haemagglutinin by the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp46 [55]. In mice infected with influenza A (PR8), infiltrating NK cells are CD27lowCD11bhi and appear to be of a mature phenotype [56]. In line with this, they also have greater cytolytic activity than IFN\u03b3 production suggesting that they could be NK cells migrating in from the blood or replicating in situ [57]. In addition to IL-12, IL-15 has been shown to play a role in NK cell responses in the lung [52, 58, 59]. IL-15 in complex with IL-15R\u03b1 can help in recruitment and activation of NK cells during rhinovirus infection and IL-15 when blocked with an antibody appears to prevent NK cell recruitment into the BAL during influenza infection in mice [58, 59]. NK cell protective function in the lung against extracellular Staphylococcus aureus also appears to require IL-15 [52]. IL-15 likely contributes to the expansion and synergizes with IL-12 and IFN\u03b1 for proper activation of NK cells in the lung. Overall, it appears that, in the mouse model, NK cells are required for survival against influenza infection [60].",

In the case of Klebsiella, NK cell production of IL-22 may also be important in establishing immunity. In response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, IFN\u03b1\n\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 are critical for control of the bacterium, the former via restriction of macrophage infiltration into the lung and the latter through inhibition of microbial growth [66].

Activation is also aided by the integration of activation signals through activating receptors on the cells. NK cell can also be pathogenic in the lung during infection from overproduction of IFN\u03b3. Questions still remaining that would be interesting to address are how to boost NK cell responses to this infection without causing overt tissue pathology and also what is the advantage of having NK cells present in the lung to promote this early control. Are NK cells more important for immune stimulation or regulation or do they have bifunctional roles as a plastic cell able to respond to the environment? Further investigation of the biology of these cells in the lung is needed to answer these questions.",

IFN\u03b3 producing conventional NK cells helps to control many infectious pathogens in the gut. Although NK cells appear to be dispensable for Listeria monocytogenes infection in mice [69], in a rat model of infection, they were essential in they were essential for early control of the bacterium [70]. Investigation of Salmonella infection in mice demonstrated that IL-15 and NK cells were required [71]. IL-15 KO mice had greater bacterial burdens than WT animals. Depletion of NK cells also resulted in the great colonization of the murine gut with Salmonella. Despite previous studies where IL-15 KO mice are still able to mount a robust NK cell response during viral and parasitic infection due to IL-12 production this did not appear to occur during bacterial infection. This difference may highlight a difference in gut NK cells or variation in gut NK cell responses to different pathogens [10, 11]. Recently, LP NKp46+ NK1.1+ ILCs were shown to contribute to gut pathology and ileitis during Toxoplasma gondii infection [72]. Their function relied on IL-15 and resulted in CCL3 dependent recruitment of inflammatory monocytes into the lamina propria. Gut NK cells therefore may have several functions, not only in controlling infections directly, but also in the coordination and regulation of immune responses in the intestinal mucosa.",

IFN\u03b2 production from macrophages was critical for this response. Interestingly, TRIF signaling downstream of TLR4 was required for this macrophage induced NK cell activity. NK cells in the GI tract are involved in control of parasitic infection. NK cells production of IL-17 in response to Toxoplasma gondii infection in the gut was dependent upon IL-6 [76]. In another model, NK cell dependent and independent IFN\u03b3 was required to control Cryptosporidium parvum infection in mice [77, 78]. NK cells in humans are also important for innate control of gut mucosal infections. In HIV patients, individuals who are known as spontaneous controllers have greater numbers of IEL associated NK cells than those who are classified as nonresponders [79]. Control of HIV in humans and also SIV in macaques could be due to NK cell derived IL-17 and IL-22 production in IELs and dependent upon an interaction with gut mucosal CD103+ dendritic cells [80]. NK cells may contribute to HIV pathogenesis early in infection as tested with an SIV model. This was shown when \u03b14\u03b27 was blocked by antibody treatment in macaques [81]. Trafficking of NK cells blocked with this treatment reduced SIV dissemination and viral burdens. NK cell activation itself may also contribute through recruitment of CD4 T cells providing the virus with more replicative niche to survive. However, later NK cells could play a substitutive role in protection. Since \u03b14\u03b27 was required for NK cell recruitment in this model, these results give support to the hypothesis that, in the gut, NK cell homing depends upon an interaction with mucosal dendritic cells (Figure 2, top). Overall NK cells in gut mucosa play an important role in protection against orally acquired infections and further dissection is needed to understand how to take advantage of this cell type to optimize protection.",

The resident cells in these tissues are all capable of producing IFN\u03b3 and cytolytic activity through ADCC. The importance of IFN\u03b3 was noted early in response to vaginal infection of mice with HSV-2 where it was shown to help in resolving this infection in mice [83]. Subsequent studies in mice revealed that a major source in the vaginal mucosa for this cytokine was NK cells [84]. This was demonstrated using RAG2\u2212/\u2212 common\u2013chain\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack T, B and NK cells and RAG2\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack only T and B cells. RAG2\u2212/\u2212 common\u2013chain\u2212/\u2212 mice were 100 fold more susceptible to infection than RAG2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Although it was shown later on that IL-15 could stimulate an anti-HSV-2 response independent of NK cells [85], as in gut mucosa infections, IL-15 was important in stimulating NK cell protective responses. Recruitment of NK cells was also important for the ability of NK cells to protect against vaginal HSV-2 infection. CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible and had higher viral loads in the CNS after vaginal infection most likely due to impaired NK cell trafficking to the site of infection [86]. Using a RAG2\u2212/\u2212 common-\u03b3-chain\u2212/\u2212 humanized mouse model, human NK cells were observed to be recruited into the genital tract of female mice infected with HSV-2 suggesting that NK cell innate protection could be important in humans as well [87]. Further evidence of a potential role for NK cells in human reproductive tract comes from SIV-macaque models where treatment of SIV infected animals with IFN\u03b1 and IL-12 resulted in enhanced activation and ADCC function of CD56+CD16+ cells in the vaginal mucosa [88]. Much investigation is still needed to understand NK cell responses in the vaginal mucosa as they do appear to be important for protection, but they can also contribute to disease pathology as seen in early HIV infection.",

            "text": "Uterine NK cells play two important roles in that they are required for tissue reorganization, vascularization, implantation of the fetus, and tolerance. At the same time they play a role in providing fetal protection during infection (Figure 2, bottom) [89]. What regulates the balance between tolerance and protection is not clear. Infection with Listeria monocytogenes results in placental colonization [90]. NK cells tested for their ability to prevent this colonization in mice were shown to not have an impact. Although IL-15 was required for uterine NK cell development and their recruitment to this site in the na\u00efve state, a lack of IL-15 did not prevent the production of IFN\u03b3 early during Listeria infection. Therefore, IL-15 in the uterus appears to play a more important role in NK cell recruitment but less of a role in early NK cell control of infection [91]. Other factors may be required to regulate their responsiveness to infection in this tissue. Human uterine NK cells did not respond to direct TLR triggering but required an interaction with TLR stimulated accessory cells from the uterus to produce IFN\u03b3 [92]. Therefore, pathogen stimulation could cause an imbalance towards inflammation rather than tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface. This is supported by a study investigating Toxoplasma gondii infection induced abortion in mice [93]. T. gondii induces a potent Th1 response including NK cell production of IFN\u03b3. Parasite infection is also known to cause spontaneous abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Infection of pregnant wild type mice in this study resulted in fetal resorption while infection of pregnant IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice had 50% reduction in effect. Surprisingly, this was shown to be independent of NK cells. However, recent studies using decidual NK and trophoblast cells from humans have demonstrated that activity of these NK cells is enhanced upon T. gondii infection [94]. This increase in activity was due to the increased expression of NKG2D by decidual NK cells after in vitro stimulation with Toxoplasma [95]. NK cells may sense their environment and be tuned commensurate with what functions are needed. This possibility is supported by the theory of NK cell reeducation as what occurs when NK cells develop a memory phenotype [96]. Since uterine NK cells recruited in the steady state are less mature, as noted by their surface marker phenotype, the cytokine/hormone milieu changes the functional phenotype needed for successful pregnancy or immune protection develops in situ. Another possibility is that new NK cells from the periphery could be recruited and contribute to pathology. Pathogen stimulated that APCs migrating to the draining lymph node activate newly recruited NK cells that are then driven to protect. Much needs to be addressed in regard to the mechanisms behind FRT NK cell function as there is relatively little known.",

Significant questions still remain in regard to (1) how they gain entry into each of the specific tissues, (2) what sources of NK cell precursors provide resident NK cells in different tissues, and (3) how their diverse functional responses are regulated in different mucosal tissues. For mucosal tissue resident NK cells in the na\u00efve state, lung NK cells may represent a more mature phenotype and could come from the blood stream. Gut mucosal and FRT NK cells may be derived from NK precursor or immature NK cells after receiving initial address directions and programming from APCs in secondary lymphoid structures. During infection, resident mucosal tissue NK cells respond primarily through IFN\u03b3 production, which contributes directly to early control of pathogens. Inflammation (IL-12, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2, IFN\u03b3, and chemokines) at the site of infection then results in expansion of resident cells and recruitment of peripheral NK cells which provide additional protection. Resident NK cells can change their functional phenotype based on the intensity of the inflammatory signals resulting in pathology in different tissues. Further studies will be important to elucidate mechanisms behind all of these processes and lead to the development of NK cell dependent therapies as well as vaccine approaches that could be useful in not only infectious disease, but also autoimmunity and cancer.",

Lung microbiome could impact NK cell development and/or function. During infection by a pathogen (red circle), dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the lung are triggered via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to produce inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and IL-23. This in combination with recognition of infected cells by activating receptors (Ly49 mouse, KIR human, NKp both) on NK cells results in activation of resident NK cell populations to produce IFN\u03b3, IL-17, and be cytolytic (CTL).",

NK cells found in the gut mucosa and FRT during the naive state exhibit an immature phenotype being CD27med-hiCD11bhi in mice and CD56brightCD16\u2212 in humans and resemble those NK cells found as residents in secondary lymphoid organs such as mesenteric lymph node (MLN) for the gut (top) and Iliac lymph node (ILN) for the FRT (bottom). This may suggest that gut and FRT resident NK cells are derived from NK precursors (NKP, pink), which migrate from bone marrow to lymph nodes (LN), where they differentiate into immature NK cells (iNK, blue cell in MLN, orange-red transition cell ILN). Dendritic cells (DC) draining from the lamina propria of the gut (CD103+) or DC from the FRT to the LN interact with immature NK cells and imprint the tissue address (\u03b14\u03b27/CCR9 for gut mucosa) that permits iNK cell homing to the correct tissues. In gut, NK cells can be IELs (orange cells) or in the LP (green cell) and respond to infectious pathogen (red circles) activated DCs and cytokine milieu in the tissue microenvironment becomes activated to produce IFN\u03b3, IL-17, and/or CTL activity. In FRT, uterine NK cells (uNK, orange cell) have to balance help with fetal implantation via trophoblast recruitment, vascularization, and tolerance with ability to respond to pathogens. If stimulation of NK cells in response to a pathogen is high enough, IFN\u03b3 is expressed and may result in loss of pregnancy. Vaginal NK cells (iNK, brown) play an important role in containing invading pathogens via IFN\u03b3 production.",
