Nonetheless, CoV E protein serves an important role in the process of particle assembly, presumably mediated by its ability to induce membrane curvature and its physical interaction with the M protein (Lim and Liu, 2001; Liu et al., 2007). In fact, co-expression of CoV M and E protein is both necessary and sufficient for the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) in cell culture (Bos et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1996). For some CoVs such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, deletion of the E gene did not completely abolish replication, but the virions were severely crippled with significantly reduced titers (Kuo and Masters, 2003; DeDiego et al., 2007). Compared with the wild-type control, SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E) was also significantly attenuated in vivo, presumably due to its deficiency in suppressing host stress response and apoptosis induction (DeDiego et al., 2007, 2011). Recently, the PDZ (Postsynaptic density 95, PSD-85; Disks large, Dlg; Zonula occludens-1, ZO-1)-binding motif (PBM) at the C-terminus of SARS-CoV E protein was demonstrated to interact with a host PDZ protein called syntenin and lead to its relocation to the cytoplasm, thereby activating the p38 kinase to induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014). Therefore, E protein modulates both viral replication and pathogenesis during CoV infection.",

Further structural and biophysical studies have gradually established a cation channel model constituted by the pentameric \u03b1-helical bundle of the transmembrane domain (TMD), which exhibited voltage-independent ion conductance regulated by lipid charges (Torres et al., 2005, 2006, 2007; Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena et al., 2012). For SARS-CoV, two mutations in the TMD \u2013 N15A and V25F \u2013 have been shown to abolish E protein ion channel activity (EIC) (Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena et al., 2012). Recombinant SARS-CoV harboring either of these two EIC-defective mutations replicated similarly as the wild-type control in cell culture, but the in vivo pathogenicity was dramatically reduced, presumably due to a lower level of calcium efflux and inflammasome activation in the infected cells (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014, 2015). However, several studies have shown that the SARS-CoV accessory protein 3a and 8a also harbor ion channel activity (Lu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2011), and recombinant SARS-CoV was not viable only when both the E and 3a gene were deleted (Casta\u00f1o-Rodriguez et al., 2018). This functional redundancy has complicated the mechanistic characterization of EIC in SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gammacoronavirus infecting chicken. Apart from the E protein, no other IBV protein has been reported to encode ion channel (IC) activity. Two point mutations in the IBV E protein \u2013 T16A and A26F \u2013 are homologous to the N15A and V25F in the SARS-CoV E protein, respectively (Ruch and Machamer, 2012). The T16A mutation abolished the ability of IBV E protein to disrupt the Golgi complex and host secretory pathway, but did not impact virus assembly as determined by the level of VLP production (Ruch and Machamer, 2012). In contrast, IBV EA26F disrupted cellular secretory pathway, but did not support VLP production (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015). Using a pH-indicating fluorescent protein pHluorin, it was also found that transfection of IBV E or EA26F, but not ET16A, correlated with an increase of Golgi luminal pH (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019). The authors thus concluded that IBV EIC facilitated virion release, presumably by neutralizing the Golgi lumen to protect the S protein from premature proteolytic cleavage (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019). However, these studies were based on overexpression experiments and the IBV EIC was not investigated by reverse genetics in the setting of actual infections. Recently, we reported the successful recovery of recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring these two mutations (To et al., 2017). Compared with the parental control, rT16A and rA26F exhibited similar levels of intracellular viral replication and assembly, but the levels of virion release were significantly reduced (To et al., 2017).",

Compared with the parental virus, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of RNA replication, structural protein translation, and intracellular virion assembly. However, the two EIC-inactive mutants formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions to the supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Remarkably, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. Additionally, EIC also contributed to the activation of ER stress response and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines during IBV infection. Moreover, IBV EIC mutations modulated apoptosis induction and correlated with virulence in embryonated chicken eggs. Taken together, using authentic infection systems, our data establish the important roles of EIC in regulating CoV infection, CoV \u2013 host interactions, and viral pathogenesis.",

The two rIBVs harboring channel-inactivating mutations reported previously (To et al., 2017), rT16A and rA26F, were serially passaged in Vero cells. The putative reverting mutation A26V was observed for rT16A in passage 10, and the mutation F14N was observed for rA26F in passage 5 (data not shown). Using reverse genetics, the parental rIBV-p65, the two IC-defective mutants (rT16A and rA26F) and the two corresponding putative revertants (rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N) were recovered and plaque-purified. The E gene was sequenced to verify the incorporation of the desired mutations and the absence of additional mutations. The titers of the virus stocks were determined by the TCID50 method. All four mutants achieved high titers comparable to the parental rIBV-p65 with no significant difference among each other (Figure 1A). However, striking differences in the plaque phenotypes were observed. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65, the plaque sizes of the IC-defective mutants were significantly smaller, and the rA26F plaques were apparently even smaller than the rT16A plaques (Figures 1B,C). Unrecognized and not reported in our previous study, such differences in the plaque sizes presumably result from a refined plaque assay protocol with a longer incubation time and the inclusion of 1% FBS in the agarose overlay. Remarkably, plaque sizes of the putative IC revertants returned to similar levels as the parental rIBV-p65 (Figures 1B,C). Taken together, the data suggest that although EIC does not affect the titers of virus stocks, deficiency of EIC results in a distinctive small plaque phenotype.",

WT:EIC-defective mutant, WT:revertant, or revertant:EIC-defective mutant was mixed in a ratio of approximately 1:9, and the mixed virus samples were passaged in Vero cells for six times. Consistent with our previous data, the fitness of both rT16A and rA26F were much lower than rIBV-p65, so the two IC mutants were rapidly displaced in a few generations (Figures 4A,D). In contrast, although the relative abundance of both rT16A/A26V and rA26V/F14N gradually reduced during the competition assay, neither of them was outcompeted by rIBV-p65 at passage 6 (Figures 4B,E). Therefore, the fitness of the two EIC-reverting mutants was only slightly lower than that of the parental virus. In line with this, when the EIC-defective mutants were mixed with their corresponding revertants, both IC-defective mutants rapidly lost out in the competition (Figures 4C,F). Taken together, the data suggest that the EIC-reverting mutations restored, though not completely, the fitness of the corresponding IBV EIC-defective mutants.",

Moreover, IBV-induced apoptosis is regulated by a number of interrelated host proteins such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Fung and Liu, 2017), as well as CHOP and IRE from the UPR pathways (Liao et al., 2013; Fung et al., 2014b). To see whether EIC is implicated in IBV-induced apoptosis, Vero cells were infected with rIBV-p65, rT16A, or rT16A/A26V at MOI \u223c 2 and harvested at 20, 24, and 28 hpi. As shown in Figure 5A, similar amounts of IBV N protein were detected at the same time points for the three rIBVs, suggesting comparable levels of IBV infection. The percentage cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a substrate of active caspase 3, was used to determine the level of apoptosis induction. As expected, significant PARP cleavage was detected in cells infected with rIBV-p65 at 28 hpi. Induction of apoptosis was also revealed by the increased cleavage level of N protein, which is also known to be a substrate of effector caspases. In comparison, a very low level and a moderate level of PARP cleavage were observed in cells infected with rT16A and rT16A/A26V at 28 hpi, respectively (Figures 5A,C).",

In this study, we have constructed five rIBVs: the parental rIBV-p65, two rIBVs harboring IC-inactivating mutations in the E protein (rT16A and rA26F), and two putative revertants harboring one additional mutation in the TMD of E protein (rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N, respectively). Using these five rIBVs, we have shown that, although not essential for intracellular genome replication and virion assembly, the EIC of IBV is required for the efficient release of infectious virions and viral fitness in vitro. It is also required for the activation of ER stress and induction pro-inflammatory cytokines during the late stage of IBV infection. Moreover, IC mutations also modulate IBV-induced apoptosis and in vivo pathogenesis.

These studies have established the structural basis behind the CoV EIC (Torres et al., 2005) and revealed its significance in modulating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014, 2015). However, several studies have shown that the SARS-CoV accessory protein 3a and 8a also harbor IC activity (Lu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2011). Moreover, while rSARS-CoV lacking both the E and 3a proteins is not viable (Casta\u00f1o-Rodriguez et al., 2018), rSARS-CoV lacking the E protein alone is viable, although significantly attenuated in vitro and in vivo (DeDiego et al., 2007). This functional redundancy complicates the interpretations of phenotypes associated with IC mutations in the E protein, as compensatory functions of the accessory proteins need to be taken into consideration. On the contrary, deletion of E gene is lethal for IBV (unpublished data), and no other proteins encoded by the IBV genome is reported to harbor IC activity. Notably, SARS-CoV E protein IC inactive mutants grow similarly as the parental virus, and their slightly lower fitness is only revealed in a long-term (20 passages) competition assay (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). In comparison, a significant smaller plaque size, a reduction of released virions by \u223c 1 log10, and a much lower in vitro fitness were observed in the IBV E protein IC inactive mutants, while all these defective phenotypes were almost completely restored in the IC-reverting mutants. Taken together, due to the absence of compensatory viroporins, EIC appears to be more critical for the replication of IBV. This also makes IBV a more desirable model to study the specific function of IC activity contributed by the E protein.",

            "text": "Compared with the SARS-CoV E protein, the location and nature of IC-reverting mutations are also remarkably different in the IBV E protein. In SARS-CoV E protein, N15 is predicted to be located facing the channel lumen; its mutation to alanine presumably compromise the attraction of cation but is not likely to affect the channel architecture (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). In comparison, V25 is located at monomer\u2013monomer interface of the SARS-CoV E protein, and its mutation to a bulkier phenylalanine is likely to introduce larger structural changes to the ion channel (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). Such speculations agreed well with the IC-reverting mutations observed during serial passages in vivo and in culture cells. An in situ mutation from alanine to the polar aspartic acid (D) was identified for rSARS-CoV-E-N15A. For rSARS-CoV-E-V25F, multiple compensatory mutations of the V25F-facing TMD residues presumably restored oligomerization and thus channel activity (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). In our previous study, we have shown that unlike the homologous N15A mutation in SARS-CoV, the T16A mutation in IBV E protein indeed abolished oligomerization, which was partially restored in the T16A/A26V revertant (To et al., 2017). Additionally, IBV E A26F did not abolish oligomerization and was compensated for by mutations at the N- and C-terminal extramembrane domains (To et al., 2017). In this study, we identified yet another reverting mutation for A26F \u2013 replacement of the bulky aromatic phenylalanine at position 14 with the polar non-charged asparagine. Although conductance measurement has not been performed for IBV EA26F/F14N, phenotypes of the corresponding rIBV strongly suggested that IC activity should be restored. The reciprocal occurrences of IC-reverting mutations at A26 or at location proximal to T16 suggest certain level of functional and/or structural relatedness. While the pentameric model depicts the general structure of CoV E protein ion channels, conformations and monomer\u2013monomer interactions may vary among different CoV species. Further structural and biophysical analysis are thus required to unravel the mechanisms behind the IC-inactivating and IC-reverting mutations of the IBV E protein.",

In contrast, the A26F mutation in IBV E protein retained the ability to disrupt cellular secretory pathway but did not support VLP production (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015). In a recent study by the same group, IBV infection, transfection of wild-type IBV E, or transfection of EA26F, but not ET16A, correlated with an increase of Golgi luminal pH (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019). The neutralization of Golgi lumen presumably protected IBV S protein from premature cleavage and facilitated the release of infectious virus from the cells (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019). Evidence from these studies suggests that the two IC-inactivating mutations might affect virion release via different mechanisms. In this study, we have observed reduced levels of both IBVgRNA and structural proteins in the supernatant of cells infected with rT16A or rA26F, compared with the rIBV-p65 control. Such deficiency in virion release seemed to be more pronounced in the rA26F-infected cells, indicating that the A26F mutation might be comparatively more destructive to the EIC of IBV. However, no apparent difference was observed in the intracellular cleavage patterns of IBV S protein in cells infected with the five rIBV, suggesting that IBV S processing was not significantly affected by the EIC. To reveal the mechanistic involvement of EIC in virion release, it would be very meaningful to determine the levels of Golgi neutralization and S incorporation in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants and respective revertants.",

            "text": "Ca2+ is one of the most important secondary messengers, relaying signals for a diversity of cellular activities such as protein synthesis, muscle contraction, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (Clapham, 2007). Intracellular Ca2+ is mainly stored in the ER lumen, where it binds with Ca2+-binding protein chaperones (such as calreticulin) to facilitate proper folding of nascent proteins in the ER (Michalak et al., 2009). Therefore, the disturbance of luminal Ca2+ concentration can substantially impact the ER folding capacity and activate ER stress response. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV E protein can form Ca2+ channels in the ERGIC/Golgi membranes (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) and that disturbance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis may lead to ER stress and cell death (Sano and Reed, 2013). In previous studies, we have shown that IBV infection induces ER stress and activates the PERK/PKR-eIF2\u03b1 and the IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR (Liao et al., 2013; Fung et al., 2014b). In this study, we observed that the upregulation of ER stress-related genes was significantly reduced in the absence of IBV EIC. Although in vitro conductance measurement of IBV E was performed with potassium ions (To et al., 2017), it is quite possible that IBV E protein may also form Ca2+ channels in the ER, thereby activating ER stress response in the infected cells. Further studies using time lapse Ca2+ imaging would be helpful to explore this hypothesis. Alternatively, IBV EIC may also induce ER stress indirectly, presumably by disrupting normal cellular secretory pathway or causing structural alterations to the ER/Golgi membrane network.",

            "text": "By serving as a Ca2+ channel, the SARS-CoV E protein boosted the activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, thereby contributing to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014, 2015). In this study, the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 was significantly reduced in cells infected with the EIC mutants, but was restored to levels comparable to the rIBV-p65 control in cells infected with the respective revertants. While it would be interesting to examine the involvement of the inflammasome pathway, induction of proinflammatory cytokines may also be mediated by the ER stress pathway. In fact, overexpression of the MHV S protein was shown to induce ER stress and upregulate the transcription level of CXCL2 (mouse homolog of human IL-8) (Versteeg et al., 2007). Other UPR effector proteins are also known to participate in the induction of proinflammatory and innate immune response (Fung and Liu, 2014; Fung et al., 2014a). Similarly, the CoV EIC may either directly or indirectly modulate apoptosis induction. CoV EIC may directly lead to Ca2+ efflux, which activates apoptosis by directly depolarizing the inner mitochondrial membrane (Giorgi et al., 2008). Alternatively, CoV EIC may first activate the ER stress and UPR, which then mediates apoptosis via the activation of JNK, CHOP, or caspase 12 (Szegezdi et al., 2006).",

To generate the IC revertant mutants, additional point mutations [T16A (ACA to GCA)/A26V (GCA to GTA) and A26F (GCA to TTT)/F14N (TTT to AAC)] were introduced to the E gene in the plasmid pGEM-IBV (20897-27614). The rIBVs were recovered as previously described (Fang et al., 2007). Briefly, five genome fragments were excised from individual plasmid vectors using type IIS restriction endonuclease BsmBI or BsaI. The fragments were then joined by seamless assembly into the full-length IBV cDNA genome containing a 5\u2032-T7 promoter and a 3\u2032-polyadenylate tail. Using this as the template, full length IBV genomic RNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, United States) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The IBV N transcript was similarly synthesized with a linearized plasmid template. The full length IBV genome and N transcripts were then electroporated into Vero cells by 100 V square waves for 25 ms using the Gene Pulser X-cell electroporation system (Bio-Rad). The cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS overnight. The medium was then changed to plain DMEM, and the cells were monitored for the appearances of CPE in the next 48\u201396 h. The rIBVs were purified by at least two rounds of plaque purification.",

Protein samples were harvested at 20, 24, and 28 hpi and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the indicated antisera or antibodies. Beta-actin was included as the loading control. Sizes of protein ladders in kDa were indicated on the left. Degree of cell apoptosis was calculated as the band intensity of cleaved PARP protein divided by the band intensity of the total PARP protein. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results (C), and the result of one representative experiment is shown. PARP(FL), full-length PARP; PARP(Cl), cleaved PARP; PARP Clv.

(A) Virus stocks of the five rIBVs were 10-fold serially diluted and 0.2 ml diluted virus samples were injected into the allantoic cavities of 10-day old embryonated SPF eggs. The eggs were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days. The numbers of live or dead embryos were counted and the 50% embryo lethal dose (ELD50) was calculated using the Reed and Muench method. The bar chart shows the average results from two independent experiments with standard deviations. (B) Cell lysates harvested in Figure 2A were subjected to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis to determine the mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Fold changes were determined by normalizing to the rIBV-p65-infected 24 hpi sample. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results, and the result of one representative experiment is shown. Comparing with rIBV-p65-infected sample of the same set: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ns, non-significant. (C) Ten-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with 750 PFU per egg of each of the five rIBVs. At 36 hpi, the whole embryos were harvested and homogenized, and total RNA samples were isolated and subjected to RT-qPCR analysis to determine the mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IBV genomic RNA. Fold changes were determined by normalizing to the samples from mock-infected chicken embryos at 36 h post inoculation. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results, and the result of one representative experiment is shown. Comparing with rIBV-p65-infected sample: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ns, non-significant.",
