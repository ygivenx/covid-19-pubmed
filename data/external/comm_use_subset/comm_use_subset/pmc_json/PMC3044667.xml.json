PCR is attractive due to its high sensitivity and broad range of virus detection. PCR-based studies have suggested the important role of respiratory picornaviruses (rhinovirus and enterovirus) as a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children [5], in particular wheezing illnesses such as bronchiolitis [6,7], wheezy bronchitis [8] and asthma exacerbations [9], but also pneumonia [2]. In addition, PCR has allowed for the detection of new respiratory viruses, such as hMPV [10], which has been implicated in upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [11-13]. It is widely believed that nowadays, epidemiological studies on respiratory viruses can only be done with PCR.",

Nevertheless only few epidemiological studies have been published based solely on DFA [22,23], and none of them included testing for respiratory picornaviruses or hMPV, because antibodies for the detection of hMPV have only recently become available and there are no commercial antibodies for the detection of respiratory picornaviruses. Recently, our group reported the validity of immunofluorescence for the detection of picornaviruses directly in respiratory samples using monoclonal antibodies originally designed for the identification of enterovirus in culture [24].",

In contrast to molecular methods, DFA is low in cost and has a rapid turnaround time [21]. Assays can be performed many times a day, and one does not have to wait for a certain number of samples to be collected to start a run. The samples can be screened for many different viruses simultaneously (\"multiplex\"). Results are usually available within 2-3 hours [39]. These aspects make DFA a method widely and often used in clinical routine, and this concurrently provides the data for ongoing, real-time surveillance of circulating viral pathogens on a large scale. Our systematic monitoring led for example to the early detection of the unexpectedly large hMPV epidemic mentioned above.",
