In line with our finding, Maniecka-Bryla et al. found that men diagnosed with the respiratory system disease in comparison to women had a higher SEYLL [22]. We would like the SEYLL to decrease over time; however, with a bird\u2019s-eye view to Fig. 1, this pattern is changing since mid-2018 and the burden of MERS-CoV infection in MERS patients has begun to increase in women.

This important issue that individuals in active age of their life had the highest SEYLL should be considered by health policy-makers in implementation of appropriate prevention and control measures to reduce the burden of premature mortality due to MERS CoV in the affected populations.

Overall, the highest SEYLL related to MERS-CoV infection was in the early four years of the onset of the infection (2012 to 2015) and then in mid-2015 the SEYLL in MERS cases declined rapidly and in the last four years of the MERS-CoV pandemic (216 to 2019), there has been a significant reduction in the burden of mortality related to MERS-CoV infection in morbid cases. In the literature review, we did not find any studies comparing these indices, however, this pattern was also reported during the epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [23, 24]. The remarkable reduction in the burden of premature mortality due to MERS-CoV indicates the technical guidance on surveillance of MERS patients, also suggests standardized approach and activities for health care providers to control and prevent MERS-CoV in involved countries.

It should be noted that of 186 MERS-CoV cases in the Republic of Korea, only details related to 57 cases were published in the disease outbreak news on the WHO website. The lack of complete details for all MERS cases potentially increases the occurrence of the selection and measurement bias in the results.
