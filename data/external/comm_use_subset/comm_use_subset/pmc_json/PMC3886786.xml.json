Since then, 81 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with 45 deaths were reported by eight countries, of which 66 (81.5%) were from the KSA\n2 (\nTable 1). Even though France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom have also reported laboratory-confirmed cases, these patients had been either transferred to these countries from hospitals in the Middle East for specialist care or had returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill.

            "text": "Coronaviruses have long been known to cause widespread human infections such as the common cold and global pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\n3. MERS-CoV has not been identified previously among humans\n4, thus knowledge about the natural history of the disease is still limited. The clinical syndrome of MERS-CoV is primarily a respiratory disease including fever, cough and shortness of breath, resembling SARS. More than half of cases develop life threatening complications, such as respiratory failure\n5,\n6, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n6\u2013\n8, renal failure\n4\u2013\n6,\n8, and consumptive coagulopathy\n8. Studies of clusters of cases suggest that the spread may occur by both large and small aerosols and possibly via the faecal-oral route\n9. The pathogenesis of MERS-CoV is not fully understood. It appears to cause respiratory problems by attacking and infecting the cells in the nasopharynx; laboratory studies show that the virus has the ability to cause profound apoptosis of human bronchial epithelial cells\n10. All confirmed cases have had respiratory disease and most have developed pneumonia\n11. Complications during the course of illness have included severe pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilations, ARDS with multi-organ failure, renal failure requiring dialysis, consumptive coagulopathy and pericarditis\n11. Hitherto, 45 out of 81 cases (55%) have died as a result of infection (\nTable 1). The rapid transmission and high attack rate in hospital settings have raised concerns about the risk of health care associated transmission of this virus\n12.",

However, at a recent meeting organized by the WHO in Cairo (June, 2013), public health officials specifically emphasized the importance of preparedness and response at Hajj and contexts of mass gatherings \u2018as a priority action\u2019, with Member States of WHO agreeing to develop specific plans for MERS-CoV\n16.

Estimates of total migrant workers by the International Labor Organization for 2010 were 105.5 million, 30 million of which were from within Asia\n19.

Unregistered \u2018irregular\u2019 migrant workers also contribute to this outflow of contractual workers from Asia, although estimates are difficult to assess due to the clandestine nature of their travel. It is important to highlight that remittance from labor migrants contribute significantly to the economic growth of most developing countries in Asia. The Sri Lankan economy is highly dependent on foreign exchange earnings from its migrant workforce, with remittance from workers in Middle Eastern countries alone contributing 58.9% of all total foreign exchange earned in 2011\n21.",

As a preparedness measure, medical staff at these health assessment centers can be trained with up-to date information on MERS-CoV and be encouraged to disseminate language specific information-exchange communication (IEC) materials on signs, symptoms and preventative actions for the migrant worker\n30.",

The importance of health accessibility, irrespective of visa status, for migrant workers to primary and specialized health care facilities in these destination countries also needs to be emphasized through state-to-state and regional advocacy mechanisms.

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLFBE) which provides policy direction and regulation of labor migrants has a dedicated 24-hour administrative desk at Sri Lanka\u2019s Bandaranaike International Airport, to manage grievances from returning migrant workers. A worker welfare center to house migrant workers in need of support managed by the SLFBE is also available near the airport. Currently there are no medical personnel attached to the SLFBE services for on-arrival phase. It is recommended that the Ministry of Health make arrangements to establish a coordination mechanism with the SLFBE and with airport health authorities, which currently have no linkage to migrant worker programs. A rotating roster of trained health professionals allocated at the health center at the airport could ensure each returning worker completes the rapid symptom checklist (see assessment algorithm in\nFigure 3). The algorithm was developed after augmenting the guidance frameworks for MERS-CoV created by the public health authorities in Canada\n29 and the CDC\n32. It is important for port health authorities to also build effective partnerships and protocols with immigration control officers at \u2018on arrival counters\u2019. This will ensure referral of travelers returning from the Middle East where cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the health screening desk.

Studies have shown that when responding to a novel infectious disease outbreak, policy and planning decisions can limit the ability to control the outbreak and result in unintended consequences including lack of public confidence\n33. Communication of risk to target populations needs to be carefully planned to avert maladaptive behaviors due to fear and defensive avoidance (the motivated resistance to the message, such as denial or minimization of the threat\n34). Individuals may defensively avoid a message by being inattentive to the communication (e.g., looking away from the message), or by suppressing any thoughts about the threat over the long term. Mitigating such threats through targeted communication strategies to migrant workers and other categories such as those described above may be useful\n35.
