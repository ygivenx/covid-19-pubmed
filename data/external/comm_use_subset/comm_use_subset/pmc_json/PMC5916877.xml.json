The antibody is directed against lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a surface-associated component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Expressed by the bacteria at high levels, this antigen is a promising target for directed imaging and therapeutic agents. By directly targeting the infectious agent, we demonstrate improved diagnostic capabilities of noninvasive imaging, which may guide improved patient management.",

In addition, this model of PJI resulted in expansion and damage of the distal femur as the infection progressed, which was confirmed by CT and high-resolution X-ray imaging (Fig. 1c).16 The anatomical changes in the distal femur of the S. aureus-infected postoperative legs can be seen clearly compared with the contralateral, non-operative leg.",

PET provides millimeter-scale tomographic images of tracer distribution throughout the whole body, while CT provides higher-resolution attenuation maps of use for anatomical localization, abnormal tissue findings, and to identify sites of bone degeneration. We have shown that FDG uptake in the surgical distal femur of infected mice was much greater than that of the contralateral, nonsurgical femur and also correlated with the BLI findings in the surgical vs nonsurgical sites. However, we also found increased FDG uptake in the sterile surgical leg (Fig. 2b), suggesting that some uptake is due to inflammation caused by the surgery.
