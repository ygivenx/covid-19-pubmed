Since 2010, a new PEDV variant belonging to Genogroup 2 has spread throughout the United States and across multiple Asian countries, including China and Taiwan [2, 3]. An initial identification in the US was made in April of 2013 [4]. A 40.5% premises-level incidence of PEDV caused the deaths of more than 8 million newborn piglets in a single year\u2014an event that significantly affected the American swine industry [5\u20139]. Subsequent Genogroup 2 epidemics have been reported in major swine-producing countries such as Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, Korea and Japan [8, 10\u201313]. One of the most notable PEDV outbreaks occurred in South Korea in late 2013 [14], more than a half million pigs died from PEDV infections in Japan between 2013 and 2016 [15], and a significant increase in PEDV outbreaks occurred in Taiwan around the same time [16]. PEDV is now considered the world\u2019s most catastrophic swine disease, with major financial impacts noted throughout the global pork industry.",

A high degree of genetic diversity has been observed in the S glycoprotein gene [18\u201320]. Partial spike (S) polyprotein genes located in the virus envelope are central to PEDV biological properties such as interactions with cellular receptors during virus entry, the neutralizing of antibody induction in natural hosts, growth adaptation in vitro, and virulence attenuation in vivo [19]. The PEDV spike (S) protein is a type 1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein with a 4,158 nucleotide sequence divided into S1 and S2 domains. The S1 region (aa 26\u2013734) is responsible for viral binding, while the S2 domain (aa 735\u20131383) serves as an anchor for viral membrane and fusion activity [21, 22]. Thus, the S glycoprotein is considered a primary target for PEDV vaccine development. As the major envelope glycoprotein found in virion, S serves as an important viral component for studying genetic relationships among PEDV isolates, and for determining PEDV epidemiological status [23, 24].",

Due to the scales and complexities of modern swine production systems, PEDV is likely transmitted between farms via diarrheic feces or vomitus; contaminated environmental sources involving clinically or sub-clinically infected pigs; trailers used to transport livestock, manure, or food sources; farmers or visitors wearing contaminated clothes; or wild animals and birds [5, 25]. Other potential sources include contaminated fomites (e.g., raw food, feed, sow milk), food ingredients or additives, and environmental features such as wind direction, farm altitude, terrain slope, and tree coverage [26]. After an initial outbreak, PEDV may spread at an increasingly rapid rate due to inadequate farm hygiene management procedures such as improper disinfection and poor biosecurity. The virus can remain dormant in weaning pigs or growth finishing units, eventually triggering mild symptoms and resulting in low mortality rates [6].",

In this study, we investigated temporal and geographic relationships among PEDV strains identified as having been transmitted among farms in Taiwan in 2014, using partial sequences from S genes extracted from porcine fetus samples and GenBank sequences as reference panels.",

These are considered starting points for PEDV complex dissemination throughout sections of Taiwan up to May 15, 2014. According to a mix of phylogenetic and coalescent data (Table 2), clustering was limited to 3 counties in southern Taiwan (Wanluan, Jiouru and Daliao) (Fig 3), with most of the identified viruses existing independently. Combined, data for PEDV divergence during the Taiwan outbreak suggest a common ancestry shared by multiple virus lineages. Since that time period, no evidence has been found indicating outbreaks involving multiple virus strains in Taiwan. According to our phylogenetic analysis, most of the identified PEDV strains from the 2014 outbreak were independent, despite sharing a common ancestor. Multiple PEDV invasions from abroad were also identified in Japan during the 2014 outbreak [15, 37]. The widespread dissemination that followed presumably resulted from the movement of pigs, agricultural vehicles, farmers, farm visitors, commercial feed products, and other materials [15, 37].",

GIS has been used to investigate correlations between diseases and factors that include pig farm size, number of feed mills, and number of pig slaughterhouses in a specified geographic zone (Fig 5). We used a mixed linear regression to identify factors associated with the number of PEDV cases in Taiwan. Results indicate positive correlations between the number of cases and both slaughterhouse number and pig farm size, and a negative correlation with number of feed mills (Table 1). The highest concentration of PEDV cases was identified in a multi-county section of southern Taiwan characterized by a large number of pig farms with high animal densities. Our results are in agreement with findings from previous studies suggesting that excessive farm capacity (measured as the total number of pigs on a farm) is a risk factor for the spread of PEDV [5]. Further, aerosol transmission is considered a viable dissemination route in environments marked by high pig densities and close animal proximities [4]. Regarding the negative correlation between PEDV cases and number of feed mills, our data indicate that pig farms at the end of feed routes likely have higher probabilities of infections. Some reports suggest that vehicles used for the dual purposes of transporting swine to slaughterhouses and delivering feed to farms may increase the potential for PEDV due to feedbag contamination [5, 25, 39, 40]. Our finding of a high correlation between the number of PEDV cases and the number of pig slaughterhouses suggests that transport trucks may have been a factor in the 2014 Taiwan outbreak.",

There is a clear need to collect more data on feed truck routes, SDPP supplement distribution, rendering plant procedures (especially delivery), and slaughterhouse processes when trying to identify the sources of various strains in Taiwan. Due to the potential for significant financial losses, there is a strong need to act on these and other possible factors before detailed studies can be designed, funded, and completed. Farms, slaughterhouses, and feed suppliers in counties with high pig densities need to immediately enhance their biosecurity measures to prevent future PEDV outbreaks, and greater effort is required to monitor potential transmission routes.",
