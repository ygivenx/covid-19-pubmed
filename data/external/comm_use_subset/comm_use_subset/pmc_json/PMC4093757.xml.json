The Review Panel, led by Professor Sir Patrick Bateson, recommended, inter alia, that \u2018Science policy-makers together with the public sector, private sector and charitable funders of research should commission a working group to develop proposals for a mechanism (output-scanning) to identify research results with potential to deliver improvements to healthcare or other significant benefits to society, and to assess the extent to which the potential benefits are achieved\u2019 (Recommendation 4).2 The MRC has indicated that this recommendation \u2018is not currently being taken forward, as we have prioritised work on other recommendations in the Bateson Review\u2019. Consequently, factual information on NHP research results and their medical relevance remains unavailable to the public and wider medical profession. This study provides this information.",

There is insufficient information on which to draw conclusions. Whatever the reasons, in order to determine the true level of translation, it is important that all studies of potential value for human health are identified and followed up.
