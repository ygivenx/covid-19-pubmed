Today, patients with influenza infection may be treated with antiviral drugs; however, these treatments are only effective when started within the first 2 days of the illness (Stiver 2003). Thus, timely and accurate diagnosis of influenza plays an important role in targeting antiviral treatment and, furthermore, has a significant role in the prevention of the misuse of antibiotics, since the symptoms of influenza are often similar to those of other respiratory illnesses caused by bacterial infections (Low 2008).",

            "text": "Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are becoming the method of choice for routine diagnosis of influenza and other respiratory viruses within clinical laboratory settings. NAATs offer superior sensitivity and specificity over serology, immunoassays, and traditional viral culture-based detection methods (Mahony et al. 2011). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays have been developed for the diagnosis of influenza and remain the most common platform used in NAAT. The RT-PCR method includes, as a first incubation step, the reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) by a transcriptase enzyme, followed by a PCR cycling stage. A RT-PCR run is typically completed within 2 h. Most reverse transcriptases are not thermostable; consequently, the reverse transcription step must be performed prior to the PCR step (Gerard et al. 2002). Typically, RT-PCR requires the use of heavy and sophisticated thermal cyclers and skilled personnel, which limits its use for in field or point-of-care applications. In an attempt to address this drawback, isothermal nucleic acid amplification platforms have been developed, which do not require the use of heavy, sophisticated thermal cyclers. Instead, isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods require only small instruments, enabling NAATs to be performed within point-of-care settings. This has the potential to allow prompt treatment of patients and limit the inappropriate use of antibiotics and antiviral drugs.",

The method relies on the recombinase-dependent insertion of a single-stranded invasion oligonucleotide (IO) into a complementary region of a target duplex DNA, which results in the dissociation of the target duplex. This dissociation event generates single-stranded DNA, which in turn allows target-specific primers to bind and extend the target sequence via the action of a DNA polymerase. The method was previously found to be useful for the rapid detection of DNA from pathogens (Hoser et al. 2014). In this study, we describe the development of a variant of SIBA technology, namely, reverse transcription SIBA (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of viral RNA targets. We demonstrate the efficacy of RT-SIBA in the detection of viral RNA by developing RT-SIBA assays for both influenza A and B. The assays were designed to detect sequences within conserved regions of the influenza genome. The RT-SIBA method includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows a one-step reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA and simultaneous amplification and detection of the cDNA with SIBA under isothermal reaction conditions. Furthermore, we compared the performance of RT-SIBA with the previously published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) real-time PCR protocol for the detection of influenza A and B.",

Special emphasis was put on the most clinically relevant subtypes, H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1; thus, sequences representing these subtypes were included in the alignment. The alignment was analyzed to find areas of limited variability using Jalview (http://www.jalview.org). A highly conserved area of approximately 80 nucleotides was identified at the 3\u2032 end of the aligned segment 1, with a suitable consensus sequence, and this area was selected as the target area for RT-SIBA assay design. Analogously, for the influenza B assay, an alignment of 1495 non-duplicate segment 3 sequences was produced. A highly conserved, approximately 80 nucleotide area was identified at the far 5\u2032 end of the alignment and selected as the assay target area.

Six different IOs with seeding regions of lengths varying from 0 to 17 nucleotides were tested.

The IO, used in SIBA reactions to separate the target duplex DNA, includes a 5\u2032 region that is not homologous to the target sequence. This non-homologous region, termed the seeding region, is included in the IO to allow for optimal coating of the homologous portion by the recombinase. The affinity of the recombinase for DNA molecules was previously suggested to be dependent on both the length and nucleotide composition of the target molecule (Formosa and Alberts 1986). Therefore, we hypothesized that the length and composition of the seeding region could also impact the speed of SIBA assays. In order to test our hypothesis, SIBA influenza A assay IOs containing seeding regions that differed in length and nucleotide composition were designed and tested, and the results are depicted in Fig. 3. The use of an IO with no seeding region resulted in reactions with the longest detection time, suggesting that the seeding region is of vital importance for efficient amplification of the target DNA. Furthermore, shorter detection times were observed as the length of the seeding region increased. Our experiments demonstrate that the optimal length of the seeding region, in terms of assay speed, is a minimum of six nucleotides. To evaluate the impact of the nucleotide composition of the seeding region on assay speed, seven IOs with seeding regions containing either polyC, polyT, polyA, polyG, poly purines, poly pyrimidines, or mixed nucleotides were tested. The use of IO seeding regions containing polyC and polyT resulted in the shortest detection times, while the use of an IO containing a polyG seeding region led to the longest detection time. The IO containing a seeding region with a mixture of pyrimidine nucleotides was found to display shorter detection times than that with a mixture of purine nucleotides. In conclusion, IOs for both influenza A and B assays used in the following experiments were designed to contain seeding regions consisting of a polyC sequence of 10 and 14 nucleotides in length, respectively.\n\n",

In this paper, we demonstrate that RT-SIBA can be applied for the rapid detection of pathogens that have RNA, rather than DNA, as their genetic material, as is the case for the majority of viruses. The method described here includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme in the same reaction tubes as the other SIBA reaction components required for nucleic acid amplification and consequently permits a one-step reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA and simultaneous amplification and real-time detection of cDNA by SIBA.",

The IO separates the target duplex, with the aid of the recombinase, consequently allowing the primers to bind and extend the target via the action of a DNA polymerase. Repeated cycles of duplex separation and primer extension are the basis for exponential amplification. In this report, the amplification times for the SIBA influenza assays were first optimized by varying the length and composition of the IO non-homologous region (i.e., the seeding region). Our experiments showed that a polyC or polyT non-homologous IO region of at least ten nucleotides in length resulted in the shortest detection times. The recombinase, UvsX binds preferentially to pyrimidine rich nucleotides (Formosa and Alberts 1986), however, the reaction demands both the binding and release of the recombinase and consequently the optimal configuration of the seeding region was determined empirically. The necessity of the seeding region demonstrated that the recombinase perform less efficiently at the initial potential binding sites prior to its polymerization from 5\u2032-3\u2032.",

Thus, the complete test can be conducted in less than 30 min. This is significantly faster than the real-time RT-PCR method, which took over 1 h for the detection of influenza. In RT-SIBA, the reverse transcription and cDNA amplification occur simultaneously and at the same reaction temperature, thus facilitating rapid detection of target RNA. By contrast, in real-time RT-PCR, reverse transcription requires an initial incubation period of 30 min at a constant temperature prior to the repeated PCR cycles of denaturation, annealing, and elongation, resulting in a total run time of 90\u2013120 min. Furthermore, RT-SIBA was found to be more sensitive than RT-PCR for the detection of influenza A and B. RT-SIBA displayed a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity, compared with RT-PCR, for the detection for H1N1. The SIBA reaction components include the single strand binding protein, gp32, which acts as a recombinase accessory protein and is required for the removal of secondary structures within the oligonucleotides used in the assay. It is possible that the presence of gp32 in the RT-SIBA reaction mixture could also contribute to the high analytical sensitivity displayed by RT-SIBA for RNA targets. This is supported by previous studies, which showed that single binding proteins enhance the yield of cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase, thus improving DNA amplification sensitivity (Jefferies and Farquharson 2002; Villalva et al. 2001). Furthermore, the difference in RT enzymes used in RT-SIBA and RT-PCR could account for the significant difference in sensitivity between the methods. Several studies show that commercially available reverse transcriptases display varying performance regarding cDNA yield and sensitivity (Levesque-Sergerie et al. 2007; Okello et al. 2010; St\u00e5hlberg et al. 2004).",

The sensitive and rapid detection of influenza viruses within 15 min, as well as the tolerance to sample derived inhibition, demonstrate that these assays are powerful molecular diagnostics tools. Since the method is performed at a low and constant temperature, there is potential for it to be run using battery operated and portable devices of considerably lower complexity than those used for RT-PCR.
