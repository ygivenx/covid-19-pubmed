This technology provides a considerable number of reads from different pathogens without a priori knowledge about them. These considerable number of reads are assembled into contigs by computer algorithms [5,6]. The contigs are then searched for homologs in a database (usually BLASTN [7]). The top-hit organism/species fulfilling the search criteria (eg, sequence identity and e-value threshold) is used to \u201clabel\u201d the contig, suggesting the existence of one particular organism/species. If assembled successfully, a contig can be long enough to reveal the entire viral genome of interest. However, the de novo assembled NGS reads often yield only short contigs that are partially aligned to or even do not match the database sequences [8], possibly because the tentative virus or similar strains have never been sequenced and thus do not appear in the database or because the virus mutated considerably (through point accumulation or recombination).",

For example, 52 544 specimens were collected from 2000 to 2008 for investigating epidemiologic features and virus isolation of enteroviruses alone [10]. Furthermore, CGMH is responsible for detecting emerging and re-emerging viruses (eg, H1N1 [11] and H7N9 [12]) when confronting outbreaks. However, not all viruses can be detected using routine assays such as immunofluorescence assays (IFAs).",

            "text": "Human rhinovirus (HRV) and parechovirus (HPeV) are 2 viruses identified in this study. HRV, a member of the family of Picornaviridae and assigned as species of the genus Enterovirus in 2008, is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus with an approximately 7.2-kb genome. HRV causes common cold with mild symptoms. HPeV also belongs to the family of Picornaviridae but is assigned to a different genus, Parechovirus. It is also an ssRNA virus with an approximately 7.3-kb genome. HPeV primarily causes sepsis and central nervous system (CNS) diseases in infants, and still has other unproven clinical manifestations [13]. Laboratory diagnosis of HPeV is not routinely available in clinical practice and is still evolving; antiviral therapy is also being developed [14]. In Taiwan, among hundreds of viral isolates, isolates possibly containing HPeV might not be detected using standard enterovirus identification procedures [15]. Additional investigations are therefore required to clarify the characteristics of HPeVs for more effective clinical diagnosis. Current methods for detecting HPeV include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of stool, blood, respiratory swabs, and cerebrospinal fluid [16]. For HPeV typing, classification of the VP1 region is the current gold standard. However, because of an unknown viral load in clinical specimens, more sensitive VP1 primers for different HPeV genotypes are required [17]. Another issue is that primers are generally not available for all HPeV genotypes [18]. NGS technology involves producing genomic sequences from clinical samples without the need for designing specific primers, thus enabling the detection of unknown or untyped HPeVs.",

PCR-based detection or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to confirm the predicted viruses. Among the catalog of possible viruses obtained from these NGS experiments, we focused on identification of HPeVs because of their reported clinical significance; furthermore, we explored their genomic context by mapping NGS reads onto them.

Preprocessing of the NGS reads was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench (version 7.5) [21] and BLASTN (version 2.2.22). In brief, we first trimmed the raw data by removing low-quality and short reads, followed by merging all the paired reads into single reads. Second, paired reads that could not be merged and merged single reads were filtered by RNA-seq analysis to remove human genome fragments. Third, the remaining reads were assembled de novo to construct contig sequences. Finally, BLASTN was used to search the assembled contigs against the nucleotide sequence (NT) database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/. Viral candidates were identified using the reported top BLASTN hits for each of the queried contig sequences fulfilling the search criterion of an e-value threshold of 10\u22125. A queried contig was required to have an average read depth of at least 20, which is the recommended lower bound for revealing a whole viral genome in metagenomic NGS data [22].",

In other words, these 2 contigs encompassed most of the first half and nearly the complete second half of the HPeV-1 genome, suggesting that TW-01662-2010 is an HPeV-1 strain. Subsequently, we implemented the iterative mapping approach proposed in this study to alter the genomic content of this HPeV-1 template to obtain as many NGS reads as possible. In brief, a consensus sequence was generated from the 2 HPeV-1 genomes, which were BLASTN subjects obtained by querying the 2 contigs. This consensus sequence was used for assembling the missing regions to generate an initial template, because contigs covered nearly HPeV genome. Subsequently, the iteration process was started from this combined genome. After 5 iterations, a terminal genome was obtained with an average mapping depth of 50.1, which increased from 35 and 49 depths of two partial sequences in 2633 and 3730 bp, respectively. A total of 56 nucleotides were present in the ORF region corrected from the initial template to the terminal template sequence. Similarly, the NGS experiment (designated as NGS 10) of TW-02547-2011 resulted in one quality viral contig of 7249 bp and depth 90, which matched the HPeV-1 PicoBank strain (FM242866) in the database. An iterative procedure started with this contig (already covering the whole genome), and after 56 iterations, it ended with a contig of depth 96.7 based on the ORF region of the terminal template. No difference was observed in nucleotides between the 2 templates based on the ORF region. That is, all iterations were the cost for substituting nucleotides in 2 UTR regions.

Fig 3 shows the genomic locations based on CDS that were graphed by the HPeV type. The HPeV-4 genome (TW-00032-2011) contained 8 variants: 1 in VP0, 1 in 2A, and 6 others at the 3\u2019 end of 3D. The HPeV-3 genome (TW-03067-2011) displayed 2 variants: 1 in VP0 and 1 in VP1. The one at position 420 of VP0 (marked in red in Fig 3) consisted of A (74.6%) and C (25.1%) and is a nonsynonymous substitution leading to an amino acid change from Glu to Asp. Six of the eight TW HPeV-1 genomes collectively displayed 54 genetic variants, among which 42 were abundant in VP0 and 3D in 2 in-silico assembled genomes (TW-01662-2010 and TW-02547-2011 in Fig 3) from NGS. The other 12 genetic variants were distributed on 4 TW HPeV-1 genomes obtained Sanger sequencing. The other nonsynonymous substitution at the nucleotide position 4616 in 3C of TW-02680-2008 consisted of C (69.1%) and T (30.4%) and led to an amino acid change from Pro to Leu.

Hence, NGS-identified viruses were confirmed and assigned to each isolate by using PCR/ELISA. All but 2 isolates (TW-01662-2010 and TW-02547-2011) were validated. An iterative mapping procedure was further performed for these two isolates that were not identified using PCR/ELISA to reveal viral genomes for detecting unknown pathogens. Although the read depths of these 2 genomes were lower than those of viral genomes from the other NGS data set, this iterative mapping process could be useful to detect unknown pathogens in clinical samples with a low viral load (or low CPE) in clinical samples. In addition, viral culturing with a low viral load negatively affects NGS experiments. Based on our experience, the time required for HPeV culture by using the RD or MRC-5 cell line is usually 3 weeks, which is much longer than 1 week for enterovirus, a common virus in regular clinical/virology laboratories. Although HPeVs have been replicated on the RD99, A549, and vero cell lines, HPeV culture is still limited by the low induction of CPE [35].",

This virus is highly infectious and causes a variety of symptoms in early childhood [38] and has atypical molecular and biological properties [13]. This study is the first to report the three genetic diversities of Taiwanese HPeV strains through various analyses, as follows. First, the phylogenetic tree in Fig 4A indicated that one HPeV-1 virus (TW-02680-2008) was highly divergent from the rest of Clade B, in which 6 nucleotide deletions were found in contrast to the other HPeV-1 viruses from the database. Although the biological consequences of this deletion are unknown, this deletion in VP0 has not been reported. Second, we suggest two cut-off values for the identification of genetic variants in a mixed sample with 1.5 gigabytes of raw reads, including a primary nucleotide composition of less than 75% and a minimum depth of 20. Based on these cut-offs, 64 genetic variants were detected from 10 HPeV strains by using NGS read mapping for revealing viral quasispecies/heterogeneity. Although additional investigations for exploring the biological consequences of these genetic variants from HPeV are required, genetic variants in the form of a viral quasispecies located in antigenic domains or drug resistant markers were similarly identified from influenza viruses. One study revealed nucleotide heterogeneity as quasispecies for characterizing influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus by using NGS read mapping [39]. Two specific amino acids (Gly172Glu and Gly239Asn) with 25% heterogeneous populations were identified, which were located on the Sa and Ca2 antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, respectively. Another study reported that Arg292Lys, one of markers for N2 that reduces oseltamivir susceptibility, was a viral quasispecies [40]. Finally, recombination events among HPeV types 1, 4, 5, and 6 were frequently detected within nonstructural (NS) genes, similar to many picornaviruses, but were more restricted among HPeV-3 strains [41\u201343]. Our HPeV-3 strain (TW-03067-2011) was found to be recombinant with a known HPeV-4 (K251176-02). Fig 5 illustrated the switch over of the 2 HPeV types in 2A. The similarity plot of TW-03067-2011 resembled an HPeV-3 reference (Can82853-01) from VP0 to VP1, and K251176-02 from 2B to 3C. Although it was reported that this HPeV-4 strain may have a recombination event with 2 HPeV-3 strains (A308/99 and Can82853-01, as shown in Clade A of Fig 4B) in the P2\u2013P3 region [44], our findings further indicated that HPeV-3 strains in Clade B were recombinant with this HPeV-4, showing a genomic region from the C-terminal 2A to N-terminal 3C derived from HPeV-4. In conclusion, we established the baseline information of NGS technology for viral detection and explored genetic diversities and signatures of HPeVs by the proposed NGS data analysis pipeline. The results of this study may help to improve epidemiological surveillance and investigations in Taiwan and around the world.",
