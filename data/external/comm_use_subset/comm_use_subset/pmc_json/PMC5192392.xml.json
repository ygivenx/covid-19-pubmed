            "text": "Several lectins isolated from natural sources inhibit microbial and viral pathogens both in vitro and in vivo [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Griffithsin (GRFT), derived from the red alga Griffithsia sp., is a homodimeric lectin with a total of six oligosaccharide binding sites recognizing terminal oligomannose residues on asparagine (N)-linked Man5-9-GlcNAc2 structures [7,8,9,10,11]. Interestingly, oligomannose structures constitute the vast majority of N-linked glycans in the HIV-1 glycan shield [12,13], and help the virus evade immune surveillance [14]. Griffithsin inhibits HIV-1 in vitro with an EC50 in the mid-picomolar range [7,15,16], with nanomolar activity against several other enveloped viruses such as acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) [3,17,18,19]. GRFT binds oligosaccharides to multiple sites on a single molecule [11], thereby occluding functionally important domains of the viral envelope glycoprotein, preventing interactions with cell-surface receptors and impeding structural transitions indispensable for infection initiation. As demonstrated with HSV-2, GRFT may also act by inhibiting virus egress and spread post-infection in vitro [17]. Importantly, GRFT\u2019s antiviral activity has been confirmed in pre-exposure prophylaxis animal models, with the lectin inhibiting HSV-2, SARS-CoV, JEV, and HCV [3,17,18,19,20,21]. This potent activity of GRFT is coupled with an excellent safety profile as shown in vitro and in several animal models [15,22,23]. Taken together, GRFT\u2019s tolerability profile and broad spectrum activity against susceptible viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, advocate for its further development as an antiviral chemopreventative or chemotherapeutic.",

Indeed, a multiphasic elimination pattern was observed after intravenous treatment, with GRFT\u2019s serum half-life changing over time. Although most of the bolus GRFT was eliminated within 8 h, therapeutically effective amounts remained for at least 96 h post-administration. Such complex elimination patterns have been observed in other recombinant protein based pharmaceuticals, which show differences in time to maximum serum concentrations and elimination rates [25,26,27]. GRFT was excreted mainly in urine starting shortly after intravenous dosing, and urine concentrations decreased with time. Further in vivo radiolabeling studies are required to determine the full GRFT distribution in the body. In addition, degradative proteolysis of the lectin might be occurring. Previous studies have shown GRFT is relatively resistant to most proteases; however, it is susceptible to leukocyte elastase [28]. Therefore, GRFT might also be vulnerable to yet to be tested proteases: extensive in vitro protease degradation assays and catabolite assessment in serum after systemic administration are needed to fully understand GRFT\u2019s susceptibility to proteases.",

Serum persistence could potentially result from redistribution from deeper physiological compartments. However, it is more likely that GRFT is involved in interactions with endogenous proteins. These hypotheses should be tested in vivo with radiolabeled GRFT and cellular protein binding experiments. Subcutaneous GRFT treatment resulted in serum concentrations peaking at approximately 4 h post-administration, with the elimination patterns mirroring intravenous treatment thereafter (Figure 1A). The initial distribution phase immediately following subcutaneous dosage was fairly comparable for both GRFT doses (10 and 20 mg/kg). However, the high dose resulted in markedly increased GRFT\u2019s peak concentration, total drug exposure, and bioavailability, compared with the low dose, as reflected by AUC values. The approximately four-fold increase in total drug amounts obtained between 10 and 20 mg/kg doses could be attributable to a gradual release or absorption from the injection site over time, while competing distribution, elimination, and degradative processes occur as the lectin enters the circulation from the capillary bed.",

Understanding GRFT\u2019s pharmacokinetics is very critical for future studies. Given that subcutaneous dosing may be viable in maintaining potentially therapeutic drug concentrations, the following parameters should be assessed: steady-state drug concentrations, loading doses, maintenance doses, and dosing intervals. GRFT\u2019s EC50 for HIV is approximately 40 pM [7]. Based on 0.06 L/h clearance determined for single 10 mg/kg subcutaneous dose, administration of 2.5 mg/kg GRFT every 72 h would achieve a steady-state concentration of 47 nM, over 1000 times the EC50 for HIV-1. However, GRFT has higher EC50 for HCV (4 nM) [3] and SARS-CoV EC50 (48 nM) [19], indicating that optimal regimens should be determined for various viral diseases, maintaining serum drug concentrations at therapeutic steady-state levels while avoiding toxicities. More frequent regimens could also be designed based on these data, to minimize peak and trough drug levels while maintaining potentially effective steady-state serum concentrations. For instance, a steady state concentration of 47 nM would require 35 \u00b5g/h or 840 \u00b5g/day to be administered. Interestingly, GRFT amounts dosed subcutaneously affected its bioavailability: at 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively, GRFT displayed 43 and 90% bioavailability rates (AUCsubcutaneous)/AUCintravenous). Although the underlying reasons remain unclear, these findings highlight the impact of dose selection on study design. It should be noted that only active GRFT was detected in this study. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory have shown that GRFT may bind some proteins in the plasma. However, how such binding affects the actual detection of GRFT deserves further attention. Using more sensitive measurements of the lectin, e.g., mass spectrometry or performing treatments with the radiolabeled compound would provide additional insights. Such experiments will be carried out in future studies.",

Nevertheless, active GRFT concentrations present in feces indicate it could be used orally to prevent the rectal transmission of HIV-1 and other pathogens such as HSV-2. Indeed, the non-absorption of GRFT after oral administration allowed for a drug fraction to pass through the digestive tract, ultimately being expelled in fecal material (Figure 4). Approximately 1% of initial GRFT amount was recovered in the feces; shielding the lectin from stomach acid and protease effects might increase the excreted amounts. Nonetheless, GRFT fecal levels exceeded its EC50 toward HIV-1 within the first 24 h post treatment.",
