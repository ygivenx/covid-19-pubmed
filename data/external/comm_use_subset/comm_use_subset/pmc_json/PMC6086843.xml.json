Eight of the sites are provincial hospitals, 4 are located in major cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and 2 are pediatric hospitals. In general, in Vietnam, public hospitals are visited by people with financial resources, whereas poor families often use commune health centers.41 In addition, healthcare utilization is reported to be 3\u20104 times higher in urban areas than in the mountainous regions in the north or central regions of the country.42 As such, the SARI sentinel sites may be under representing poor individuals, especially from rural or remote areas. Because some of the SARI sites were pediatric hospitals, the age distribution was skewed, and 52.1% of the SARI specimens tested were in patients <5 years. This age distribution may have biased the results toward increased RSV detection. In addition, despite finding a large proportion of SARI specimens positive for RSV, it is not well understood whether the SARI case definition is appropriate for RSV,43 and because of this, some proportion of RSV cases may have been missed.

Additionally, in the era of GHSA the study demonstrates an ability to enhance and expand surveillance by building and extending upon existing in\u2010country capacities. While these data provide valuable initial insight into the burden of severe respiratory disease, the real value will only be realized over time as data are collected and analyzed consistently through multiple years. Such data can be used to understand seasonality, contribution by various pathogens to respiratory disease burden, and the risk groups of these noninfluenza respiratory viral pathogens in Vietnam.",
