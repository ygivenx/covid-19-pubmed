            "text": "Bioluminescence is the phenomenon of the production of light by a chemical reaction within a living organism. It was first discovered in firefly (Lampyridae species) and since then has been used for various screening and staining activities with an advantage of observing the cells under a compound microscope. Firefly luciferase (FLuc) emits luminescence (up to 560 nm) without the requirement of any external light excitation and uses ATP for the conversion of its substrate luciferin to oxyluciferin in a luciferase enzyme catalyzed oxidation reaction. Initially, FLuc was used only in luminometery based reporter assays using cellular lysates. Later luciferase expressing cells and mouse lines were developed for non-invasive imaging of rodents. Injection of the luciferin substrate in mice produces luminescent signals that can be easily detected by in vivo imaging modalities. Apart from beetle, luciferase has been isolated from members of the coelenterazine species, i.e. Gaussia, Renilla, Pleuromamm and Oplophorus. The luciferase from Renilla sp. (RLuc) uses a different substrate \u201ccoelenterazine\u201d and produces a higher and stable luminescent signal as compared to the FLuc [1]. RLuc has an added natural advantage of being an ATP independent enzyme, and thus requires less energy to produce luminescence. However, a major limitation of FLuc and RLuc is their short life span and therefore these luminescent proteins cannot be used for long duration imaging assays. This led to the development of a more photostable and robust luciferase in the form of an enhanced beetle luciferase (ELuc) which again uses luciferin as the substrate and is an ATP dependent enzyme [8]. A comparison between ELuc and FLuc showed phenomenal differences in the intensity and photostability of the two luciferases. However, the Km values (Michaelis constant) of the enzymes in regard to ATP consumption were found to be almost equal, and it was concluded that the ATP use is not the reason for a better performance of Eluc. Moreover, ELuc was tested in cell lines such as NIH/3T3 using various promoters, and it was shown that the luciferase primarily localizes in nucleus, cytosol and in peroxisomes. Certain vectors and promoters also play an important role for their suitable expression namely pCMV vector used in mice cells along with the astrocyte specific promoter mPer2 which outperformed FLuc by a factor of 10- and 16-fold in cell extracts and live cells, respectively [8].",

Additional mutants were generated replacing the Serine65 with threonine, alanine, glycine, cysteine or leucine leading to a protein with a single absorbance peak at ~489 nm [9-12]. Expression of GFP at high concentrations in the cells posed the problem of dimerization which was resolved by side directed mutations at A206K, L221K or F223R residues [13]. The enhanced GFP (EGFP) was developed with the modification and mutations described above at various positions of wtGFP. Proteins tagged with enhanced GFP can be visualized in cells with low light intensities causing less photobleaching to enable imaging and quantification of intracellular proteins and its pathways effectively [14-16]. To tackle the problem of mixed chromophores in live cell imaging experiments, several mutants of wtGFP including Enhanced GFP (EGFP) and Emrald GFP were generated which retained its fluorescent properties but with non-overlapping spectral properties [17].",

            "text": "Development of different variants of GFP with different absorption and emission spectra provided the opportunity for simultaneous multi-color staining of the cells. Early variants included the blue fluorescent protein (BFP), developed by introducing a point mutation (Y66H) to shift the absorbance and emission spectra to 384 nm and 448 nm, respectively, and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) which was discovered from mutants of A.victoria[17]. Since the spectra of BFP and EGFP are distinguishable, a combination of these two FPs was first used for multi-color imaging in cells and Fluorescent (F\u00f6rster) Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis [9,31,32]. However, a major drawback of BFP was its low intensity and faster photobleaching [33]. Therefore, enhanced BFP (EBFP) was developed by using codon optimisation for human cells [34]. Notably, Azurite, an EBFP, was developed by the Dauherty\u2019s group and was reported to be 40-fold more photostable and brighter than the conventional BFP. EBFP was generated by incorporation of two additional point mutations (F64L and S65T) in the BFP and was considered to be the brightest BFP for the time until further improvements were made [24]. Subsequently, EBFP 1.2 was developed based on mutations at S30R, Y39N, T65S, S72A, N105T, I171V, N198S and A206V in EBFP and was 4-fold brighter than EBFP [23]. Further modifications of EBFP 1.2 led to the development of EBFP 1.5 which was more photostable than its predecessor EBFP 1.2 but with no increase in fluorescence. Azurite, as previously mentioned, had increased photostability as compared to EBFP 1.2 and EBFP 1.5 due to the mutations at V150I and V224R, respectively. However, this caused a decrease in the fluorescence by 30% [24]. Screening of a library of mutants generated by random mutagenesis identified EBFP2 with enhanced fluorescence and photostability when compared to EBFP and Azurite. EBFP2 was reported to be 4-fold brighter and 550-fold more photostable than EBFP and 1.4-fold brighter and 2.9-fold more photostable than Azurite [23]. However, both EBFP2 and Azurite tend to dimerize when expressed in cells at higher concentrations. This was overcome by replacing the alanine residue at position 206 by valine [35]. BFP was further modified to develop a stable red fluorescent protein (RFP). Site directed and random mutagenesis of RFP generated mTagBFP with a shift in excitation spectrum and blue emission [36]. Although mTagBFP is the brightest among all the BFPs produced, it is 1.4-fold less photostable than EBFP2 [23]. Therefore, mTagBFP was mutated at I174A to give rise to mTagBFP2, i.e. a 1.5 fold more photostable BFP with a similar spectral profile and maturation half time as that of the parent protein [37].",

CFP was also brighter and more photostable when compared to BFP [9] and was created by a point mutation (Y66W) with a spectra intermediate between BFP and EGFP. Further improvements were also made to increase the stability and intensity of CFP [18,32]. Mutation at T203 position of wild type GFP with an aromatic amino acid resulted in shifting of excitation and emission over 20 nm into yellow wavelength. This led to the development of Enhanced Yellow FP (EYFP). Although EYFP is a dimer and sensitive to chlorine, three variants of EYFP were developed namely citrine (monomer), Venus - a fast maturing FP at 37\u00b0C and the yellow fluorescent protein for energy transfer (YPet) - used in FRET along with cyan FPs [29,30,38].",

            "text": "Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) was first isolated from an Anthozoan, Diascoma, with excitation and emission of 558 and 583 nm, respectively [39]. The major advantage of RFPs over GFPs is their longer excitation wavelength causing less damage to the cells and much less auto fluorescence in cells at the red spectrum. Also the maturation of FPs obtained from anthozoan is more efficient as compared to that of jelly fish FPs at 37\u00b0C. Native RFP has the disadvantage of forming tetramers which at times tends to aggregate in the cells and also cause false oligomerization of target proteins to hinder their native function [40]. DsRed, the common RFP available, has prolonged maturation time often taking days to turn red from a greenish complex; this feature has been used to observe aggregate formation in target cells [41]. Monomeric RFPs have also been developed from DsRed through a series of mutations, and the resultant proteins exhibited different maturation rate as well as fluorescent properties, i.e. mOrange, mKO, mStrawberry, mCherry, Tag RFP, mPlum, mKate and tdTomato [42]. Due to its fast maturation rate, high photostability and wide pH tolerance mCherry is a widely used long wavelength FP. However, it tends to dimerize that limits its experimental use. Later the protein was modified to prevent its dimerization in the cells. It is considered to be the brightest RFP with enhanced photostability, and it has only a 3 nm longer excitation and emission wavelengths compared to its predecessors [43]. Similarly, Tag RFP was developed from wtRFP isolated from sea anemone Entacmaea quadricolo by introducing mutations at five different sites (R162E, Q166D, S180N, F198V and F200Y) [44].",

Out of the fourteen different FlAsH ligands screened, FlAsH-EDT2 showed strong affinity for hexamer peptides and positive emission at 635 nm. FRET studies in HeLa cells with FIAsH-EDT2 genetically fused to the COOH-terminus of an enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP-FIAsH) evidenced a 3-fold increase in fluorescence at 635 nm when compared to the ECFP alone transfected cells [32,51,52]. However, emission of ECFP at 480 nm declined to about 30% in FIAsH-EDT2 transfected cells due to FRET interactions. ReAsH-EDT2, a resorufin based fluorescent complex with excitation and emission maxima of 593 nm and 608 nm, respectively, was successfully tested for FRET studies with GFP and YFP probe pairs in HeLa cells [53]. Similar protein-ligand complexes were synthesized and used namely CrAsH-EDT2, sFlAsH-EDT2, F2FlAsH-EDT2, CHoXAsH-EDT2, SpLAsH-EDT2-Alexa594, CaG FlAsH-EDT2 and AsCy3-EDT2. Several modifications have been carried out to improve the quantum yield, tetracysteine binding affinity and to reduce the cytotoxicity of these complexes. Specifically, Malachite green (MG) and Thiazole orange (TO) derived intercalating FAPs were developed which bind to RNA aptamer and DNA, respectively, and lead to enhanced (2,360- and 550-fold, respectively) and bleaching stable fluorescent signal from the fluorogens [54-56].",

Similarly, viral promoters and vectors have been tested in different cell lines for their specificity and stability of expression. pCNS and pCNS-D2 vectors were reported to express cloned genes in cell lines and can also act as a shuttle vector between bacteria and mammalian cell lines to facilitate an easy cloning process. This vector system has been tested for stable expression of luciferase in HepG2, Hep3B, HeLa, SNU638 and SNU668 cell lines.

Since then, several viral vectors have been developed including the recently explored corona virus of the SARS virus family. This RNA based vector provides a stable and prolonged expression for more than 30 passages in different cell types [62].

Baculoviral vectors have been modified to infect mammalian cell lines either as the whole baculovirus or as a helper cell mediated gene delivery in cells. Adenovirus terminal repeats were used for the replication of the target gene, and the whole plasmid was packed into the baculoviral vector Bac-B4 for transfer in cell lines such as 293B5B1. The transfected cells showed not only stable expression but also a 100-fold increase in the vector titer during subsequent passages [67]. Of note, DNA fragments of approximately 38 kb were efficiently transferred into different cell lines using such a vector. Direct incubation of oligodendrite and chicken muscle cells with baculoviral vector showed a transfection efficiency of 60% [68]. Further increase in transfection and expression efficiency was achieved by additional modifications in baculoviral vectors such as an introduction of the metallothione promoter (Bac-ME). The Bac-ME vector showed a transfection efficiency of 90% with low leaky expression and reduced cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. The expression efficiency of these vectors was further enhanced by treating the transfected cells with ZnSO4[69].",

Amongst the two variants of PVP, PVP10 was reported to be cytotoxic at all concentrations while PVP40 showed negligible cell toxicity and even improved the transfection efficiency. PVP40 has been used for transfection studies in macrophages and hepatocytes [84]. Sucrose is also known to cause intracellular swelling of vesicles in endosome and lysosomes due to osmotic pressure [85,86]. Sucrose in conjunction with lipid-DNA complex or lipofection reagents was shown to increase their transfection efficiency in fibroblast cell.

The mouse perilipin 2 gene was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pECFPN1 and was stably expressed in mouse L fibroblast cells. Subsequently, NBD was used to stain phosphatidyl choline to form NBD-PC complex, and a confocal microscopy based FRET assay was employed to determine the interaction between lipids and proteins in the cell. Similarly, co-localization of perilipin 2 and sphingomyelin (SM) near plasma membrane was demonstrated using NBD-SM and plin2-CFP vector constructs [110]. Although CFP and YFP are most widely used probes YFP has the disadvantage of having low quantum yield and poor signal to noise ratio hampering the process of individual CFP intensity measurement. To counter this problem, two ECFP molecules were fused; however, the result was a further decrease in the intensity due to multiple excited states causing interconversion of excited states by homotransfer. Notably, multiple excited states are due to two different crystal structure conformations of ECFP [111]. This problem was resolved by site directed mutagenesis of the His148 residue to aspartate, and the fluorescence intensity of the mutant was further increased by a factor of 2.5 as compared to ECFP. Further mutations at S72A and Y145A residues boosted the extinction coefficient of the monomer but caused a decrease in the quantum yield. The modified ECFP is known as Cerulean and is proved to be a better FRET donor than the conventional ECFP [111]. Figure 4 depicts a basic understanding on how FRET analysis can be done using ECFP and EYFP particularly for lipid droplet studies.",

To examine whether the GFP-ADRP products for both species retained the capacity to associate with these structures, constructs expressing the fusion proteins were transfected in HuH-7 cells. After stimulation with fatty acid, the formation of lipid droplets in HuH-7 cells can be identified by staining with lipophilic dyes and by antisera raised against ADRP/plin2. The signal from GFP-mADRP was detected from the surface of spherical intracellular structures while EGFP was seen throughout the HuH-7 cells. The localization of endogenous hADRP and the GFP-mADRP products coincided, indicating that GFP-mADRP was located at the surface of lipid droplets therefore demonstrating that it is possible to detect tagged and untagged ADRP on the same lipid droplet. To verify the localization of GFP-mADRP, cells expressing the fusion protein were incubated with BODIPY 558/568 dodecanoic acid, a fluorescent fatty acid analogue that is sequestered in lipid droplets. The dye was selected because of its spectral properties which allow differentiation from EGFP and a better cell permeability as compared to Oil red O. Results in both live cells and paraformaldehyde fixed cells showed localization of GFP-mADRP at the surface of lipid droplets stained with the BODIPY dye. Attempts to fuse EGFP to the C terminus of ADRP/plin2 yielded few cells that produced fluorescence of the chimeric protein but in this case the signal did not derive from the surface of lipid droplet. Consequently, EGFP fused to the N terminus of human and mouse forms of ADRP/plin2 was used in further studies [93].",

The sensitivity of these techniques differs significantly, and the detection of proteins at low expression levels still remains challenging. The proximity ligation assay is a relatively inexpensive quantitative technique with high sensitivity. The technique is developed on the principles of antibody targeted assay, split reporter assay and polymerase based amplification of oligonucleotides. In this assay, the target proteins are recognized by specific antibodies (two or more) conjugated with short oligonucleotide strand. In case these probes are in near proximity, the oligonucleotides can be ligated by addition of complementary oligonucleotide and ligase enzyme and subsequently amplified using PCR or rolling circle amplification. This leads to the formation of more than 1000 copies of the complement of 100 bp in one hour using the phi29 polymerase [114]. The incorporation of multiple fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides in the polymerase catalyzed reaction causes amplification of the signal resulting in high sensitivity. Apart from protein expression and protein-protein interaction, this highly versatile technique can also be adapted to detect post-translational modifications, co-localization and interaction of proteins with other biomolecules (Figure 5). PLA was recently used to demonstrate that the MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 could prevent MYCN/Max interaction in situ and caused accumulation of lipid droplets in tumor cells [115].",

However, for the visualization of certain cell components in live cells such as lipid droplets options are currently limited to organic dyes, i.e. BODIPY, Nile red and Oil red O. The emission spectrum of these dyes overlaps with that of GFP and RFP; thus, it is not feasible to use them in combination for multi-color imaging. There is unmet need for the development of a new lipophilic dye which can be spectrally resolved from commonly used fluorophores. Monodansylpentane, a cadaverin family dye with blue emission spectra, is the appropriate substitute for the red dyes for lipid staining. Furthermore, this can be used along with far wavelength fluorescent proteins to obtain better insight into the lipid metabolism. Discovery of novel proteins involved in the lipid droplet metabolism and their fusion with fluorescent proteins that can be spectrally resolved will help researchers to delineate the process of biogenesis of lipid droplets under live cell conditions. The advancements in culture systems to ensure long term metabolic activity of hepatocytes, the development of suitable transfection methods and reporter assays will be instrumental for the success of live cell imaging experiments.",
