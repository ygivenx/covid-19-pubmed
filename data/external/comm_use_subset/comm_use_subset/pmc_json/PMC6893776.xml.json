In humans, ZIKV infection has been associated with a mild disease characterized by fever, rash, arthritis, and conjunctivitis [1]. However, the recent epidemic in the Americas in 2013\u20132015 in an immunologically na\u00efve population revealed that ZIKV can also cause severe neurological symptoms, such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and microcephaly [2]. ZIKV is primarily spread by Aedes species mosquitoes, and vertical and sexual transmission among humans was confirmed during the last epidemic. Multiple infection routes of ZIKV are facilitated by its ability to productively infect several types of human cells, such as skin fibroblast and dendritic cells [3], Sertoli cells [4], trophoblast progenitor cells and cytotrophoblasts, as well as placental macrophages [5,6]. ZIKV also replicates in human brains and cells of the neuronal origin [7,8].",

            "text": "Infected cells respond to virus infections by activating innate immune responses. In RNA virus infection, especially the RIG-I-like pattern recognition receptors, RIG-I and MDA5 recognize ssRNA and dsRNA molecules of invading and replicating viruses. RIG-I-like receptors activate signaling cascades involving cellular kinases that eventually phosphorylate and activate transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u0138B. These factors translocate into the nucleus and initiate the expression of type I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type III interferon (IFN-\u03bb1-4) and other inflammatory cytokine genes. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is produced by several cell types, whereas IFN-\u03bbs are produced by immune cells and cells of epithelial origin [9]. Virus-infected cells secrete IFNs that bind to their specific receptors, IFNAR1\u2013IFNAR2 (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and IL28Ra\u2013IL10Rb (IFN-\u03bb1-4) initiating a signaling cascade leading to the phosphorylation, activation, and dimerization of transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2. STAT1/STAT2 dimers associate with IRF9 to form the so-called ISGF3 complex, which then translocates into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This initiates cellular antiviral responses via the production of antiviral proteins such as MxA, Viperin, and IFIT proteins [10,11,12,13]. Most, if not all, pathogenic viruses encode proteins that interfere with the activation host innate immune responses.",

            "text": "ZIKV has a positive sense ssRNA genome that encodes for one large polyprotein including three structural (C, M, and E) proteins and seven non-structural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins. The polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into individual proteins. ZIKV infection leads to the production of interferons and antiviral proteins [14] and ZIKV RNA has been shown to stimulate both RIG-I and MDA5 receptors [15]. In order to replicate more efficiently in virus-infected cells, ZIKV has mechanisms to evade or delay the activation of innate immune responses. Recent studies have shown that ZIKV can interfere with interferon-induced responses: ZIKV infection inhibits STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation [16], and especially ZIKV NS5 protein inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation [15] and induces the proteasomal degradation of STAT2 [15,17,18,19]. ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protein complex promotes the degradation of Jak1 resulting in reduced STAT1 phosphorylation [20]. ZIKV E, NS4A, and NS5 proteins inhibit the expression of IFIT1 gene [18], and NS1, NS2B3, NS4B, and NS5 proteins have been shown to inhibit the expression of IFIT2 gene [20]. In addition, NS1, NS2B, NS4A, and NS5 proteins inhibit IFN-\u03b2-induced, and NS5 protein also IFN-\u03bb1-induced ISRE activation [15,18,19]. ZIKV also interferes with the production of IFNs: ZIKV infection prevents the translation of type I and III IFNs in dendritic cells [16]. Several ZIKV proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) have also been shown to inhibit the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter [15,18,20,21,22]. NS1, NS4A, and NS5 proteins were demonstrated to inhibit the activation of IRF3 and NS5 was shown to inhibit NF-\u03baB reporters [18]. In most of the events described above the exact molecular mechanisms are not known. However, it has been suggested that some ZIKV proteins block TBK1 function [20,21,22] leading to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation [21].",

We found that the ZIKV NS5 protein efficiently inhibits RIG-I-induced IRF3 phosphorylation, leading to a reduction in type I and type III interferon promoter activation. We show here that ZIKV NS5 interacts with IKK\u03b5, an important downstream kinase of the RIG-I pathway. The data indicates that this interaction leads to impaired ability of IKK\u03b5 to phosphorylate and activate IRF3 leading to reduced activation of IFN promoters including that of the IFN-\u03bb1 gene.",

To study at which level on the RIG-I pathway ZIKV NS5 exerts its inhibitory functions, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with \u2206RIG-I, MAVS, TBK-1, IKK\u03b5, and a constitutively active form of IRF3 (IRF3-5D), together with ZIKV NS5 expression plasmid. ZIKV NS3 and HCV NS3/4A were used as putatively negative and positive controls, respectively. Overexpression of the pathway components led to a strong activation of the IFN-\u03bb1 promoter (Figure 6). HCV NS3/4A protease complex, which degrades the MAVS protein [44], strongly inhibited \u2206RIG-I, MAVS, TBK-1, IKK\u03b5, and, to a lesser extent, IRF3-5D-induced activation of IFN-\u03bb1 promoter. ZIKV NS3 had no inhibitory effect on any of the pathway components. Surprisingly, ZIKV NS5 dose-dependently inhibited the activation of IFN-\u03bb1 promoter by all the pathway components, indicating that the inhibitory effect of ZIKV NS5 may act at or downstream IRF3 activation. It is noteworthy that the inhibitory effect of ZIKV NS5 on IKK\u03b5 overexpression-induced activation of the IFN-\u03bb1 promoter was detected only with reduced amounts (from 30 ng per well to 3 ng per well) of IKK\u03b5 expression plasmid, indicating that high-level expression of IKK\u03b5 can override the inhibitory effect of NS5 (Figure 6, at the bottom).",

Secreted IFNs protect cells from virus infection, and ZIKV infection is inhibited in cells pretreated with IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, or IFN-\u03b3 [3,18,46]. Of these, IFN-\u03bb1 is especially important in protecting epithelial barriers from virus infection [9] and, as shown earlier, ZIKV infection is prevented in placental trophoblasts which are secreting IFN-\u03bb1 [45]. Thus, IFN-\u03bb1 is important in protection from ZIKV infection since ZIKV spreads through epithelial barriers such as the skin, the blood-brain barrier, and the placenta. However, like other flaviviruses, ZIKV has the means to inhibit or delay the activation of innate immune responses. So far, most studies have focused on type I IFNs. In this study, we systematically analyzed the effect of all ZIKV proteins on the RIG-I pathway and type III IFN-\u03bb1 promoter activation. We found that ZIKV NS5 protein efficiently inhibited the RIG-I pathway by interacting with IKK\u03b5 followed by inhibition of phosphorylation of IRF3 and reduced activation of IFN promoters.",

The inhibitory effect on the activation of IFN-\u03bb1-promoter required a full-length NS5 protein, as has also been shown for TBK-1-related inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation by the African lineage ZIKV NS5 [22].

Our observations are well in line with the results of Hertzog and coworkers, who have shown that no other proteins apart from NS5 inhibit RNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation [15]. Some of the flavivirus NS proteins function together, like DENV NS2B-NS3 proteins which act as an active protease complex [47].

            "text": "The exact molecular mechanisms of ZIKV proteins on the inhibition of IFN promoter activation are to some extent not known. Wu and coworkers have shown that ZIKV NS1 and NS4B inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation by interacting with TBK-1 preventing its dimerization and phosphorylation [20]. Xia et al. [21] reported that IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation was inhibited by NS2A, NS2B, and NS4B via blocking the phosphorylation of TBK-1. In addition, ZIKV NS4A suppressed IRF3 phosphorylation and NS5 was suggested to function on IRF3, possibly by interfering with the nuclear import of IRF3 [21]. Lin et al. reported that NS5 prevented IRF3 phosphorylation by direct binding to TBK-1 [22]. Our data on ZIKV NS5 inhibiting the activation of the IFN-\u03bb1 promoter is well in line with the results described above, suggesting a function for ZIKV NS5 at or after activation of IRF3. However, in contrast to the results by Xia et al. [21], we observed that ZIKV NS5 inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b5 and IRF3. In addition, we found a reduction in the amounts of IKK\u03b5 with increasing expression levels of NS5, and furthermore, IKK\u03b5 was also found to bind to NS5. In contrast to the data from Lin et al. [22] who demonstrated that NS5 can interact with TBK-1, we and Xia et al. [21] did not observe the inhibitory effect of NS5 on TBK-1. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the used ZIKV strains, cell types, or expression constructs, as well as differences in overall experimental conditions. Indeed, Esser-Nobis et al. [48] recently showed that infection with Zika viruses of different genetic lineages (Asian vs. African) led to differences in innate immune responses, resulting in differential IRF3 phosphorylation. In the above-mentioned studies, Wu et al. [20] and Lin et al. [22] used African ZIKV strain in their experiments, while Xia et al. [21] used both African and Asian lineage viruses, which both showed NS5-related inhibition of IFN-\u03b2-promoter activation.",

            "text": "Different flaviviruses are known to have different functions for the same/similar proteins. Flavivirus NS5 proteins have two active domains: A methyltransferase and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain. Even though these biological functions are similar amongst flaviviruses, NS5 sequences of flaviviruses show up to 45% differences at amino acid level [17] allowing these proteins to have variable biological functions. For instance, DENV NS5 induces STAT2 degradation via E3 ubiquitin ligase [49], WNV NS5 inhibits IFNAR1 expression [50] and STAT1 phosphorylation [51], YFV NS5 binds to STAT2 and prevents its binding to ISRE sites [52], and ZIKV NS5 binds to STAT2 and induces its proteasomal degradation [17,18,19]. ZIKV NS5 also inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation which leads to reduced IFN-induced ISRE activation [15]. Even minor changes in amino acid sequences have been shown to impact these mechanisms. For example, a single amino acid substitution in ZIKV NS1 leads to a protein variant that targets the RIG-I pathway by inhibiting TBK-1 phosphorylation [21]. In addition, a single amino acid substitution in WNV NS2A protein leads to an attenuated virus phenotype with an inability to inhibit IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production [53]. In our study, the NS genes originate from a highly pathogenic Asian lineage ZIKV strain isolated from fetal brain. Whether there was a selection towards a more fit/aggressive virus type with an exceptional ability to inhibit innate immune responses remains to be studied.",

Zika virus infects through epithelial barriers where IFN-\u03bb1 is an important component of the host cell defense.
