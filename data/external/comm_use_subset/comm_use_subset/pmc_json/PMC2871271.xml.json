            "text": "The immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily contains a large number of receptors that serve as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediating homotypic cell-cell-adhesion in multicellular animals. One group of mammalian IgCAMs is named according to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor marker used in the surveillance of colon cancer [1]. Interestingly, CEA is only known from primates, where it is expressed by mucosal epithelial cells. Similar to CEA, most other CEA-related CAMs (CEACAMs) are restricted to specific mammalian lineages, and only a few CEACAMs, such as CEACAM1 or CEACAM16-20, have orthologues in distantly related mammals [2-4]. Accordingly, sequence comparisons based on published genome data have provided evidence that CEACAMs have independently diversified in each mammalian order [3,5].",

            "text": "In humans, CEACAM1 is the target of several Gram-negative commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabit the nasopharyngeal, intestinal, or urogenital mucosa. In particular, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. lactamica, N. meningitidis, N. subflava, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli strains have been found to associate with the protein core or carbohydrate structures of this glycoprotein [6-11]. These bacterial species utilize distinct surface proteins (adhesins) to engage CEACAMs. For example, the neisserial colony opacity associated (Opa) proteins allow gonococci and meningococci to bind several CEACAM family members including CEACAM1, CEA, and CEACAM6, which are expressed on the apical surface of mucosal epithelial cells. Opa proteins are integral outer membrane proteins with 8 transmembrane \u03b2-strands and 4 small extracellular loops, with the central loops participating in CEACAM recognition [12]. Opa-like proteins with a similar \u03b2-barrel structure are also found in commensal Neisseria species and can mediate the association with CEACAM1 [11]. In addition, several typeable and non-typeable strains of Haemophilus influenzae, a species that shares the mucosal habitat and lifestyle of Neisseria, can engage CEACAM1 via their outer membrane protein P5 [9]. Another inhabitant of the human oro-pharyngeal mucosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, can bind via the UspA1 surface protein to the N-terminal domain of CEACAMs [10]. UspA1 belongs to the family of trimeric autotransporter or oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin (Oca) family. The prototype of the Oca family is the adhesin YadA of enteropathogenic Yersiniae that has a lollipop structure with a head group, an extended coiled-coil stalk region and a membrane anchor domain [13]. The mature trimeric UspA1 with a size of about 250 - 300 kDa protrudes up to 60 nm from the bacterial surface and is therefore completely distinct from membrane-embedded neisserial Opa proteins or the Haemophilus protein P5 [13]. Surprisingly, CEACAM recognition by the Moraxella UspA1 is mediated by a short sequence within the stalk region requiring a bend conformation of the UspA1 extracellular domain to accommodate CEACAM1 binding [14]. Moraxella strains lacking this peptide sequence within their stalk region fail to bind to CEACAMs [15].",

            "text": "The striking convergent evolution of structurally distinct adhesive proteins to engage CEACAM1 suggests that this binding is important during the life cycle of these bacteria. As all CEACAM-binding bacteria greatly differ in their pathogenic potential, but share the same ecological niche, it is highly likely that CEACAM-binding promotes colonization of the mucosa. Indeed, in vitro experiments have suggested that CEACAM-binding is not only a means to firmly attach to the host cell surface, but also suppresses the detachment of infected epithelial cells [16]. CEACAM-targeting bacterial adhesins might therefore represent colonization factors that promote the ability of bacteria to establish a firm foothold in their ecological niche. Whether this specialization is also a determinant of the host range of these bacterial pathogens is not known. Though bacterial species expressing CEACAM-binding adhesive proteins are in most cases human-specific, and have no other natural host organism, it has not been experimentally tested whether their adhesins selectively recognize human CEACAMs or can also bind to orthologues from other mammalian species.",

In particular, we tested Opa protein-expressing N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis as well as UspA1-expressing M. catarrhalis for their ability to recognize CEACAM1 homologues of human, murine, canine or bovine origin. Biochemical binding studies clearly demonstrate that these bacteria selectively interact with human CEACAM1. Furthermore, analyses of bacterial internalization show that the observed amino acid changes in the amino-terminal domain of mammalian CEACAM1 orthologues have clear-cut functional consequences. Accordingly, our data not only demonstrate that bacterial adhesins have co-evolved with the receptor molecules of their mammalian host, but also support the view that the diversification of CEACAMs in mammalian lineages is a pathogen-driven process.",

In particular, the non-glycosylated CC'C\"FG-face of the immunoglobulin fold is the binding interface recognized by microorganisms [25]. To analyse if this potential evolutionary pressure by pathogens is reflected in sequence variation within this domain, we aligned and compared the published sequences of the amino-terminal immunoglobulin variable (Igv)-like domain of human, murine, bovine and canine CEACAM1 (Fig 1A). Indeed, sequence differences between the mammalian species are most prominent in \u03b2-strands forming the CC'C\"FG-face, whereas the glycosylated AA'BDE-face of the immunoglobulin-fold has a higher amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1B). To test if these sequence differences result in an altered functionality with regard to pathogen binding, we generated several constructs that allowed us to test the association of CEACAM amino-terminal Igv-like domains with various pathogens and to analyse their ability to mediate bacterial internalization by mammalian cells (Fig. 1C). Accordingly, we expressed Igv-like amino-terminal domains derived from human, bovine, murine, or canine CEACAM1 as secreted GFP fusion proteins in human 293 cells, a cell line that does not express any CEACAM family members endogenously (Fig. 1D). Importantly, GFP-tagged fusion proteins were found in cell culture supernatants of transfected cells and were expressed at similar levels as detected by Western blotting with GFP antibodies (Fig. 1D).",

Opa expression by the gonococci was confirmed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against neisserial Opa proteins (Fig. 2A). Following incubation with the amino-terminal CEACAM1 domains from different mammalian species, the samples were washed, and the bacteria-associated fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. Clearly, the non-opaque bacteria (Ngo Opa-) did not reveal a positive signal in the GFP channel for any tested protein, confirming that Opa proteins are the sole neisserial factor necessary for CEACAM recognition (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the non-opaque gonococci, the OpaCEA-expressing bacteria clearly associated with the isolated amino-terminal Igv-like domain of human CEACAM1 (Fig. 2B). Most importantly, OpaCEA-positive gonococci did not associate with the Igv-like domains of murine, canine or bovine origin (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the association of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with CEACAM1 is limited to the human orthologue of this protein and suggests that CEACAM1 recognition is species-specific.",

Moreover, in all cases these microbes were located outside the GFP-expressing cells as evidenced by their rhodamine and AlexaFluor647 labeling (Fig. 5, arrowhead). In contrast, cells expressing human CEACAM1 contained numerous intracellular bacteria that co-localized with the GFP-tagged receptor in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 5, arrow). The absence of the AlexaFluor647 label clearly confirms the intracellular localization of these bacteria (Fig. 5, arrow). Similar to the situation in GFP-transfected cells, 293 cells expressing murine CEACAM1 showed only very few cell-associated bacteria and no intracellular bacteria were detected (Fig 5, arrowhead). Though both human as well as murine CEACAM1-4S-GFP localized on the cell surface, only human CEACAM1 is recruited to the cell associated bacteria and is co-internalized with OpaCEA-expressing gonococci (Fig 5). Together, these microscopic investigations provide further evidence, that only the human CEACAM1 orthologue is a target for the Opa protein adhesins of N. gonorrhoeae and is able to mediate the binding and uptake into eukaryotic cells.",

Here we provide evidence that CEACAM-binding adhesins from pathogenic Neisseriae and Moraxella catarrhalis display a high selectivity for human CEACAMs and do not associate with orthologues from non-primate mammalian species. Accordingly, the amino acid sequence divergence, that is particularly high in the CC'C\"FG-face of the amino-terminal Igv-like domain of mammalian CEACAM1 orthologues, results in functional differences with regard to bacterial binding.

Starting from a primordial CEACAM1-like gene, CEACAMs seem to have undergone independent duplication and diversification events in different mammalian lineages resulting in an expanded family of closely related surface molecules [2,26]. Therefore, even within a mammalian order such as the primates it is difficult to assign orthologues genes except for CEACAM1 [27]. As several members of the CEACAM family are exploited by viral and bacterial pathogens, it has been suggested that the driving force behind the rapid diversification of CEACAMs in different mammalian lineages might be the selective pressure by pathogens [3,28].",

Accordingly, the bacteria can efficiently invade only cells that express the human orthologue of CEACAM1, but not the murine orthologue. It is interesting to note, that additional pathogenicity factors of these bacteria show a similar exquisite specialisation for human molecules. For example, the neisserial IgA1 protease [34] only cleaves human IgA1 molecules, but not IgA molecules from other mammalian species. Similarly, the transferrin-binding protein, that is critical for iron acquisition in the human host, can utilize only transferrin from human sources or from closely related apes such as chimpanzee [35,36]. Gonococci are also able to escape from host complement attack by recruiting complement component 4b-binding protein (C4bp) [37]. This ability is again specific for human C4bp and even chimpanzee C4bp only provides protection from complement for some, but not all gonococcal strains [38].",
