            "text": "Jiangsu Province is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River along the East Coast of China (Figure 1), where schistosomiasis is endemic. The disease is caused by the zoonotic trematode worm Schistosoma japonicum with the Oncomelania hupensis snail serving as the intermediate host for the parasite [1], [2]. Historically, Jiangsu Province was among the endemic areas with the highest level of schistosomiasis transmission in China. Due to extensive control efforts with a particular focus on intermediate host control in the past three decades, the province reached the criterion of transmission control in 1976, and no acute cases were reported between 1978 and 1984 [3], [4]. After that, various environmental changes (e.g. frequent flooding) altered the level of disease endemicity; snail habitats re-established or expanded resulting in re-emergence of highly endemic areas and reappearance of acute human cases [5], [6], [7]. In 2005, the government of Jiangsu Province revised and strengthened the schistosomiasis control strategies by the implementation of a package of comprehensive measures, such as integrated chemotherapy with praziquantel for humans and bovines, snail control, improved water supply, enhanced sanitation with focus on personal hygiene and health education [8]. After 5 years of extensive implementation of this comprehensive control program, all endemic counties in Jiangsu Province reached the criterion of transmission control (i.e. <1% human/bovine prevalence and absence of snail infection) [9]. After achieving this level of control again, the province embraced the next control objective \u2013 elimination of schistosomiasis transmission by 2020 [10]. Yet, challenges on route to this goal are present as traditional surveillance (e.g. focusing on infected humans and snails) is inadequate due to limited sensitivity of current diagnostic tools, which cannot support control strategies tailored to the new low-transmission situation [11]. In addition to host-based diagnostic methods, the use of mice challenge to assess environmental risk (the mouse bioassay), is widely used [12]. However, also the sensitivity of the mouse bioassay becomes unreliable when transmission levels decrease. These limitations present formidable challenges for surveillance and control, which have yet to be overcome, so a sensitive and field-friendly alternative is very much needed.",

Because it is usually administered by mail, the likelihood of individual experts influencing each other is minimized at the same time as participation of experts from a large geographical area is enabled [14]. The Delphi method has been widely used for business forecasting and has some advantages over other forecasting methods [15], [16], [17], [18]. It has also been used successfully in other areas ranging from technology forecasting to drug abuse [13], [19], [20] as well as development of indicators d in early warning systems (EWS) for the spread of infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and influenza outbreaks [21], [22], [23].",

The social factors include those at the national and regional level, such as policies and patterns of development, which impact local economic activities that in turn influence risk factors of human infection at the community level including households and individuals [24], [25], [26]. Huang et al. [6] reviewed how social structure and factors influence individual risk and prevalence of S. japonicum infection in China, and showed that the risk of S. japonicum infection is also influenced by the domestic environment, including both location of the house in relation to snail-colonized water sources, access to safe water and improved sanitation. The risk of S. japonicum infection is thus related to many different factors, not only environmental but also social ones [27], [28], [29], [30]. Early warning identification and control measures should be considered as multi-faceted. However, a limited resource allocated to the schistosomiasis control program in Jiangsu Province is basically a local activity, unable to implement different interventions simultaneously [9], [10], [31]. This fact has drawn attention by both policy-makers and medical personnel, who advocate a multi-faceted approach for schistosomiasis elimination [32], [33], [34], [35]. Thus, it is necessary to establish priorities and integrated assessment methods based on both environmental and social factors. We first proposed the SEWI concept to identify relevant types of data needed in estimating the impact of schistosomiasis interventions on the transmission risk; we also tested the operational feasibility of SEWI to develop a conceptual framework and identify obstacles that need to be overcome. Because transmission patterns and impact factors are different in different environmental regions, we considered various local regions along the Yangtze River when developing the methodology. However, we believe that the methodology as proposed can also be applied to other endemic areas of schistosomiasis.",

However, the aims of these previous studies were different from ours and the scope was limited to specific, research purposes. Rather than predict the risk of transmission in a prospective manner, they were generally carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures and did not aspire to establish an integrated index by collecting and combining field data. In addition, the endemic status of schistosomiasis along Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province is characterized by low prevalence rates and generally low/intensity infections, which is significantly different from other regions. Here we aim to develop a comprehensive and feasible index, the SEWI, and demonstrate its use in Jiangsu Province, representing a low-transmission area along the lower Yangtze River.",

The number of second-order indicator decreased from 11 to 7; four indicators were removed after the second round,two indicators were close to the livestock, including the Endemic status of livestock, Control measures for livestock. The other two indicators were Health resources and Climate factors. Throughout history, livestock (particularly water buffaloes) have been the main source of infection for schistosomiasis [42], [43]. The economy of Jiangsu Province has been developing rapidly since the 1990s, and the province is now one of the most economically advanced in the country. During this time period, the cattle population decreased significantly and pasture in the snail habitats was forbidden. The infection rate of livestock also declined significantly year-by-year and no positive stool tests have been observed in livestock since 2008. Thus, livestock as source of infection has weakened significantly in Jiangsu Province [10], [44], [45]. Given the situation, during the 1st round expert consultation, most experts suggested removing the indicators related to livestock. The economic and meteorological characteristics in the 18 selected endemic counties were all similar, and most funds for control activities came from national and provincial agencies [46]. The contribution of health resource and meteorological factors to S. japonicum infection were similar, and most experts also suggested removing or changing these two second-order indictors. After two rounds, the weights of control measures for snail and transmission route were the highest and the lowest, respectively, suggesting that the contribution of the snail distribution was important for schistosomiasis transmission, which is consistent with the current control strategy in Jiangsu Province [10]. Among the third-order indicators, the weight value of the result of snail detection was the highest and showed that each county along the Yangtze River should strengthen the snail surveillance component of their control efforts to lower the risk of schistosomiasis transmission.",

The human seroprevalence declined by 64% and the parasitological prevalence by 58% from 2005 to2008 [10]. However, there remains a potential for re-emergence of the disease in the study area as infected snails and human infections continue to be reported in the region [7], [47]. Developing a EWS to inform about the risk for schistosomiasis transmission, particularly in low-transmission areas, has become highly desirable. World Health Organization (WHO) is strengthening existing surveillance systems for infectious diseases developing EWSs based on new concepts and techniques in order to trigger prompt public health interventions. We have explored an EWS based on mice bioassays and spatio-temporal analysis [12] constructing a comprehensive index that integrates all possible risk factors related to S. japonicum transmission. Furthermore, the method can be adapted and applied also for other diseases following the study framework shown in Figure 2. However, more technical development is still needed. Firstly, the number of indicators can be optimized or simplified without losing informative power thereby increasing the specificity of the SEWI; Secondly, it would be useful to carry out a prospective study to further evaluate and verify the SEWI approach.",
