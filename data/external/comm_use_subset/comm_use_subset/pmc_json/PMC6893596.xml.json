            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae [1]. It is an emerging swine enteric virus that causes diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death in nursing piglets and the mortality rates are about 40%\u201380% [2]. The earliest identification and report of PDCoV was in Hong Kong in 2012 by Woo et al. [3] but it only began to receive much attention after an outbreak in the United States in 2014 [4]. Subsequently, it spread quickly through much of the United States [5], Korea [6], Canada [7], Japan [8], Vietnam [9] and Thailand [10], incurring enormous economic losses to the pork industry. In China, the prevalence of PDCoV was about 36.43% in suckling piglets in Henan province and 21.7% in Guangdong province. Moreover, co-infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was common in infected piglets [11,12]. The first Chinese PDCoV strain, CHN-HN-2014, was reported in 2014 and was found to be closely related to the PDCoV strain HKU-155 [13]. Since then, several other PDCoV isolates have been reported in the pork producing provinces of China [12,14]. To date, complete genome sequence of known PDCoV strains are relatively conserved and share 97.1%\u201399.9% nucleotide identity [15]. Phylogenetic analyses based on the complete genome have suggested that PDCoV may have originated from a sparrow coronavirus [16]. In addition, Lau et al. found that the novel avian deltacoronavirus QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from quails belonged to the same coronavirus species as porcine coronavirus HKU15 and sparrow coronavirus HKU17, providing an example of avian-to-swine transmission [17].",

The two opening reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1ab, occupy almost two-thirds of its genome and encode two polymerase proteins, pp1a and pp1ab, respectively, which are proteolytically cleaved into 15 mature non-structural proteins [19]. The other one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S protein), envelope (E protein), membrane (M protein), and nucleoprotein (N protein) [20]. E and M are the transmembrane proteins and are involved in viral replication [21,22]. The N protein is highly conserved and plays a vital role in binding viral RNA [23]. Three accessory proteins, NS6 (located between M and N genes) and NS7/NS7a (located within N gene), are also found in the PDCoV genome [24,25]. These proteins may be associated with immune modulation and viral pathogenesis, although they are not essential for viral replication [26]. The E, M and N proteins may have potential to serve as efficient tools for the development of diagnostic assays and/or vaccines against PDCoV.",

Many studies have demonstrated that mutations in the S protein affect the virus\u2019 tropism and pathogenesis. For example, deletions in the S gene of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a non-enteric pathogen derived from the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), alter its tropism and pathogenicity [28]. Sun et al. found that mutations in the S gene of PEDV wild strain PEDV-LY4-98 resulted in increased pathogenicity to neonatal piglets [29]. Additionally, the S protein is highly immunogenic, which makes it a useful target for the development of effective vaccines against coronavirus [30]. ",

For example, China ranks first in pork production in the world and Sichuan province in southwest China ranks first in pork production in China, and yet, to date no information on PDCoV emerging from or circulating in this area is accessible except for a submitted sequence (CH/Sichuan/S27/2012). In this study, we describe PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015, the first report of a strain isolated from this area. Sequence alignment, phylogenetic and recombination analysis based on the complete genome were performed to determine genetic variabilities and evolutionary relationships within this species. The pathogenicity of this strain to five-day-old piglets was investigated by clinical assessment and histology. ",

Several alphacoronaviruses, such as PEDV and TGEV cause diarrhea and vomiting in piglets, leading to enormous economic losses in the swine industry [35,36]. Swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV), a recombinant between PEDV and TGEV reported in 2016, also causes diarrhea in swine [37]. Additionally, some novel alphacoronaviruses related to the bat coronavirus HKU2 have recently been reported in China; these viruses, porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) [38], swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), [39] and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) [40] are also major pathogens of diarrheal disease in swine. The deltacoronavirus, PDCoV, also causes diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in nursing piglets, and it is clinically indistinguishable from other enteric diseases caused by these porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus. Moreover, coexistence of pathogens, such as PDCoV and PEDV, PDCoV and PoRV, increase the mortality rate of infected piglets, which incurs massive economic losses to porcine industries [41]. Taken together, the pathogens associated with diarrhea in piglets have attracted much needed attention to the necessity for expanded preventative, diagnostic, and treatment measures.",

From the 10 samples, only the PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015 was successfully isolated. Viral identification was done by RT-PCR/qRT-PCR, IFA, and EM. Sample quality is a crucial factor for the successful isolation of PDCoV. Clinical samples may contain unknown viruses or other pathogens or very low amounts of infectious virus, all making successful isolation difficult [18]. The addition of exogenous trypsin in vitro enhances virus entry into the host cells by proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, which is necessary for coronavirus infection [42]. Therefore, the concentration of trypsin in the LLC-PK cell culture media may contribute to the isolation of PDCoV [43]. In our study, the maintenance medium was supplemented with 7.5 \u00b5g/mL trypsin, which is higher than the concentrations used in the studies that demonstrated the effectiveness of trypsin in in vitro PDCoV infections [44]. In addition, the time at which the sample is actually collected may also contribute to the success of PDCoV isolation.",

            "text": "Mutations in the coronavirus S protein are considered the key factors responsible for PDCoV virus pathogenesis and host tropism change [47,48]. A sequence analysis based on the complete genome of the PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015 showed a 3-nt deletion in the S gene; this deletion is found in other Chinese isolates but not in isolates from the USA, Japan, South Korea, or Southeast Asia, suggesting a mechanism for differences in virulence among these PDCoV strains. However, whether this particular deletion contributes to the efficiency of viral replication and/or the virulence of these strains is in question. After passage 30, we found six nucleotide changes in the S gene compared with the original sample CHN-SC2015, which induced corresponding amino acid changes, excluding the synonymous mutations at the position 1443 and 1587. The amino acid mutation at position 162 is a glycosylation site located on the surface of amino-terminal domain within the S protein. The lack of glycosylation at this site may hinder the virus\u2019 ability to evade the host\u2019s immune response because of the lack of glycan shielding of S protein epitopes [34,49]. The 11-bp deletion in 3\u2032UTR in this strain was not found in 58 of the reference strains; the exception was PDCoV strain CHN-HG-2017, indicating that CHN-SC2015 may be a novel strain to the province of Sichuan. According to the phylogenetic results, based on the complete genome and S gene, PDCoV CHN-SC2015 falls into a different clade compared with many other PDCoV strains currently circulating in China. This difference indicates that variations, for the most part, existed in other genes of the PDCoV during evolution and transmission [50]. Moreover, CHN-SC2015 belongs to a different clade than PDCoV isolates from Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam. ",

Su S et al. posit that the large genome and multiple host species were major factors for the high rate of recombination events, which can alter tissue tropism, transmission routes, and host specificity [53]. Like most coronaviruses, deltacoronavirus also possess the potential to undergo some recombination events that can facilitate interspecies transmission and jump to the new hosts. Lau et al. reported that porcine coronavirus HKU15 from recombination between sparrow coronavirus HKU17 and bulbul coronavirus HKU11 in the S gene region [17]. In this study, a recombination analysis predicted that CHN-SC2015 had undergone recombination with strain SHJS/SL/2016 from the China and TT_1115 from Vietnam. The predicted breakpoint is located in the nsp3 gene, which is similar to the strain CHN-HG-2017, which may have been derived from the major parent strain SXD1 from China and minor parent strain HaNoi6 from Vietnam [54]. However, the breakpoint of the recombinant virus between the two different strains may be distinct.",

            "text": "In recent years, the pathogenicity of PDCoV to piglets has become a focus of investigation [16,55,56]. The clinical profile of PDCoV infection, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death, are indistinguishable from other enteropathogenic porcine coronavirus infections such as PEDV and TGEV [19]. In our study, the pathogenicity of PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015 was demonstrated in five-day-old pigs orally inoculated with 106.35 TCID50/mL cell-culture-adapted virus. Gastrointestinal tissues from a challenged piglet at 5 dpi showed evident lesions indicating that the intestinal tract is the main site for virus replication. Recent reports have found that PDCoV is transmissible by indirect contact with an infected piglet, indicating that the respiratory tract may be the minor target for PDCoV infection [57]; Moreover, in our study, we also found that the control piglets had developed mild diarrhea along with PDCoV CHN-SC2015 infection, leading to a low score of diarrhea from 6 DPI, which further supports the notion that PDCoV can transmit via the respiratory tract. This route of infection is also true for PEDV, which can disseminate from the nasal cavity to the intestinal mucosa, providing further evidence for the airborne transmission of gastrointestinal coronaviruses [58]. Analysis of daily fecal samples and post-mortem tissues and organs by qRT-PCR demonstrated that PDCoV RNA continually and gradually increased from 1 to 7 dpi in feces, PDCoV RNA was distributed in multiple tissues and organs, indicating extensive tissue tropism; these results are consistent with other studies [18,59].",
