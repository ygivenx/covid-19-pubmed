Dengue virus is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4) circulate in endemic areas. Although infection with one serotype of dengue virus confers life-long protective immunity to that serotype, it does not protect the host from infection with other serotypes [3].",

Through means not yet fully understood, Langerhans cells spread the virus, via the lymphatic system, to other tissues such as liver, spleen, kidney and blood, whereas monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells are the major cell types in which the virus replicates [5]. In the majority of symptomatic dengue infections, a fever of 5\u20137 days duration develops together with bone and joint pain, retro-orbital pain, nausea and fatigue, this is called dengue fever (DF). While the majority of DF patients recover without intervention, 2\u20135% develop a more severe form of the disease, called dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), characterized by thrombocytopenia and vascular leakage, causing hypervolemic shock and death if not promptly treated [6]. The cause of DHF/DSS is not clear. Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) is the most widely supported theory explaining the higher risk of DHF/DSS associated with a heterologous secondary infection [7]. The phenomenon of T cell \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d has also been described [8]. Like many viruses, dengue inhibits IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 signaling by suppressing Jak-Stat activation, resulting in reduced host antiviral response [9]. The combination of a reduced host defense, increased uptake of the virus and delayed viral clearance likely synergizes to produce higher viremia resulting in a more severe outcome.",

Infection with dengue of a more transformed HUVEC-like cell line, ECV304, was analyzed by a different microarray system containing 7600 cDNA oligonucleotides [13]. In this study, the expression of 15 genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton was found to be altered after infection[13]. Using a different gene expression approach, primary macrophages infected with a clinical isolate of dengue were analyzed by a cytokine array containing 375 human cytokine-related genes with approximately 20 genes observed to be either up- or down- regulated [14]. However, the functional importance of these changes, if any, was not studied [14].",

We identified the upregulation of three major clusters of genes; NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine responses, type I IFN response, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Increased expression of selected genes, identified by Compugen array, was confirmed using a taqman low density array (TLDA) and results extended to include an additional, readily infectable, cell line (A549) and PBMC derived from adult dengue fever patients from a Singapore dengue prospective cohort study. Next we sought to confirm the functional effects of these upregulated genes. We confirmed the high levels of two novel chemokines, IP-10 and I-TAC, in dengue infection, in both cell lines and in dengue patients. We also determined that overexpression of viperin, an upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, and proteasome inhibition, with MG-132 or ALLN, reduced virus replication. In summary, we have used microarray analysis to identify new host genes associated with dengue infection, and to show that components of the host response can control dengue viral replication and therefore represent potential targets for drug therapy.",

All three methods showed that new viral replication began after 24 hours and reached a plateau at 72 hrs, with FACS analysis showing 28% of cells infected at this point. After 72 hrs a degree of cell death become apparent (data not shown) and the experiment was not continued. Analysis of microarrays, performed in duplicate (dye-swapped) on three biological replicates at each time point, comparing infectious with heat inactivated virus; using a SAM q value (false discovery threshold) of 25%, revealed no significantly differentially expressed genes at 3, 6, 12 or 24 hrs post infection. However, there were 24 transcripts identified at 48 hrs and 124 at 72 hrs (a total of 132 transcripts representing 124 genes; Table S1) that were differentially expressed. At both 48 hrs and 72 hrs, clustering of transcripts using PANTHER analysis identified the IFN-mediated immunity pathway as the most significant with a P value of 10\u221215 (at 72 hrs). Genes that are typically induced after type I IFN stimulation, including OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OASL, STAT1, STAT2, MX1, IFIH and IFN\u03b2, featured prominently in this cluster (Figure 2 and Table S1). Further analysis of the 124 genes suggested the involvement of NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine responses (NFKBIB, NFKB1A, TNFA1P, CCL4, CCL5, IP-10 and I-TAC amongst others) and ubiquitin related genes (HERC5, HERC6, UBE2L6, USP15 and others) (Figure 2). Although not completely overlapping, a core host response to pathogen involving the IFN response and the NF-\u03baB-mediated immune defense response [10] was observed in our array results. Other genes that were significantly changed included those associated with cell signaling, lipid metabolism, cell cycle and vesicular transport (Table S1).

Fifty genes fulfilled these criteria (Table S2) and, we felt, represented common genes involved in dengue virus response, or virus replication, while excluding responses that were cell type specific. These 50 common genes were mapped by direct interactions using the MetaCore program which illustrated the close clustering and interconnectedness of a network of 29 of genes around NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1 and STAT1. (Figure 3A). The NF-\u03baB gene alone was added to the network, despite not being from our common list, to illustrate the connections between those induced by it. For example, the upregulation of IP-10, I-TAC, VEGF, PAI1, B2M, TNFAIP3 and RIG-1 could all be linked to the activation of NF-\u03baB, while NFKB1B and NFKB1A, two feedback control genes for NF-\u03baB activation, were also upregulated reflecting the self containment of this activation (Figure 3A). The degree of upregulation varied between the genes in this pathway with I-TAC and IP-10 being the most highly up-regulated (average expression in the two cell types and patients) genes (Figure 3B). A number of genes clustered around STAT1 were associated with the IFN pathway, and examination of the common list revealed another four genes (viperin, IFI44, IFIH1, G1P3) related to the IFN pathway that were upregulated but not mapped by the MetaCore program (Figure 3C). Finally, a number of genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway also appeared on the MetaCore map (HERC5, USP18 and Hdm2) with several more (unmapped) genes appearing on the common list (Figure 3D)",

In order to determine if this up-regulation of gene transcription lead to translation and protein release, concentrations of IP-10 and I-TAC protein in cell culture supernatant following dengue infection were determined by ELISA. In both the A549 and HepG2 infection models, dengue infected cells produced moderate, but significant (compared to heat-inactivated virus treated cells), concentrations of IP-10 (Figure 4A) and I-TAC (Figure 4B) at 72 hrs, but not at earlier time points (data not shown). We next investigated if these, or other, NF-\u03baB induced proteins were influencing dengue virus replication. Adding dexamethasone to the HepG2 infection model to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation [25] prevented IP-10 and I-TAC production, but had no effect on viral replication (data not shown). These results suggest that NF-\u03baB activation, and IP-10 and I-TAC production, do not have a direct effect on viral replication and are, rather, simply part of the immune response to infection.",

In order to investigate the role of viperin in dengue infection, we used an established A549 cell line stably overexpressing viperin (Vip) [26]. Comparing to infection in wild type A549 cells (WT), viperin overexpressing cells were significantly resistant to viral replication, as shown by plaque assay two days after infection (Figure 5A), with and without pre-treatment with IFN\u03b2 (+IFN; 500 U/ml). Although pre-treatment with IFN\u03b2 had the greater anti-viral effect, viperin over expression alone resulted in a small, but significant, reduction in virus production both with (P = 0.038) and without (P = 0.0004) IFN\u03b2 pre-treatment. These results suggest that viperin is an functional component of the IFN-mediated response to dengue, and demonstrate, for the first time, that viperin could be part of the anti-dengue response.",

In order to investigate the role of ubiquitin-proteasome system in dengue infection, we introduced proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and ALLN, to the HepG2 dengue infection model [30]. At lower concentrations, both MG-132 and ALLN significantly reduced virus replication in the cell lines by over 50% (Figure 5B). An examination of the effects of these compounds on the integrity and viability of inhibitor-treated cells using fluorescein diacetate revealed no cytotoxicity at these concentrations (Figure 5C).

Using microarray analysis of gene expression and high throughput quantitative real-time PCR, we investigated the host response to dengue infection in cell lines and in DF patients. We further validated our microarray results by functional study of the identified genes. Although dendritic cells, Langerhans cells and monocytes have been proposed as the principle reservoirs of viral infection [4], it is not clear which other tissues, if any, are targeted. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridisation studies of biopsies from DHF patients have indicated that a range of tissues are infected by the virus, including cells in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney and peripheral blood [5]. We chose the HepG2 cell line as the primary cell model for this study as it readily supported viral replication, and it is derived from the liver, which might be of some clinical relevance. The A549 cell line was included as it was also an excellent supporter of viral replication even though there is, presumably, little or no clinical relevance. The final clinical relevance came from the validation of the genes in 10 DF patients from the Singapore EDEN cohort. The 10 patients were selected based on low platelet count, because of the lack of WHO DHF/DSS manifestation in Singapore adult patients. Despite the limited sample number, and the wide range of collection times, variation between individuals at the same time point was ruled out by statistical analysis. We believe that with more patients, more genes that are differentially expressed would be identified.",

IP-10 was also proposed to compete with virus binding on the receptor in vitro\n[39]. However, the relevance of this study to human patients is not clear. Although IFN\u03b3, \u03b1/\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB could all induce the production of IP-10 and I-TAC, prevention of IP-10 and I-TAC via NF-\u03baB inhibition clearly reduced the IP-10 level in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 were not consistently upregulated in the two cell lines or in DF patients in our study (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that NF-\u03baB activation rather than IFN induction played the major role in elevated IP-10 and I-TAC in dengue infection. The inhibition of NF-\u03baB, and consequent IP-10 and I-TAC inhibition, had no demonstrable effect on dengue replication in cell lines, suggesting the more complex role for these chemokines in a multi-cellular in vivo setting. Concentrations of each chemokine were significantly higher during the early stages of dengue fever, while I-TAC levels were reduced at the second visit, IP-10 levels remained high. The persistently high level of IP-10 might also contribute to the immunopathogenesis of dengue although this would require further investigation. It may be that concentrations of IP-10 and I-TAC, in combination with a viral antigen, could be used as an early marker for dengue fever. It is interesting to note that the level of IP-10 and I-TAC were independent of previous history of dengue infection, as half of the ten tested patients were suffering from a secondary infection. The common clinical feature of the ten selected patients was the low platelet count at second visit. Because of the lack of severe dengue cases (by WHO definition) in Singapore, the low platelet count was used as the measure of severity by which the ten patients from the cohort study were classified as having more severe dengue fever. We cannot at this point make a link between the level of IP-10, I-TAC and disease severity because of the small number of cases used in this study, a more detailed clinical study, currently underway, aims to determine if the concentrations of IP-10 and I-TAC during early stages of infection are linked to the progression to more severe forms of disease.",

The induction of viperin has been suggested to be anti-viral in both HCMV [26] and hepatitis C (HCV) [27] infections, but this is its first association with dengue infection. The use of viperin overexpressing A549 cells demonstrated that, in addition to being significantly upregulated during infection, viperin is directly involved in the anti-viral response to dengue, as shown by the suppression of dengue replication in the presence of increased expression of viperin. This effect was not as significant as the effect of IFN\u03b2 alone suggesting that viperin is only a part of the IFN-mediated response to dengue. The molecular mechanism of the action of viperin to counter dengue infection will need to be further studied.",

HCV polymerase has also been shown to interact with a ubiquitin-like protein leading to its degradation [43]. In dengue, ubiquitin-proteasome genes have not been reported to be involved in the dengue virus life cycle although a recent publication has shown that dengue envelope protein interacts with SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9) and that overexpression of Ubc9 reduces virus production in a cell line [44].",

Use of proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and ALLN, significantly reduced the release of dengue virus following infection of the HepG2 cell line. Previously, it has been shown that the effect of proteasome inhibitors may be virus specific with these compounds less (or non-) effective against virus such as influenza [45] and equine infectious anemia virus [46]. The effect of proteasome inhibition on viral replication appears to be mediated via a number of different processes including the involvement of ubiquitin or the proteasome in virus assembly [45], budding [47] and release and maturation [48]. Further studies may elucidate the exact role the ubiquitin-proteasome plays in dengue virus replication which may involve trafficking of the virus to the plasma membrane or the maturation and fusion of the virus upon release [49].",

That study identified genes whose protein products are expressed in the ER to be the most significantly enriched, which directly overlaps with our identification of the ubiquitin pathway; specifically including UBE2 and the PSMB genes. This may represent a process fundamental to viral replication in any system. In addition, Simmons et al. described host responses associated with dengue shock syndrome that clearly overlap with our interferon related gene list. In particular, G1P genes, OAS genes, IFI genes and Mx genes were found in both studies, suggesting that the amount of viral replication may be directly related to clinical outcome.",

Specific components of the response to virus, such as viperin and IP-10 and I-TAC have been implicated in dengue infection for the first time. Further investigation of these components, together with the precise role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in virus replication, may lead to drug targets for dengue. The use of gene array in multiple cell systems to investigate genes involved in virus replication, used in concert with functional studies, has proved to be a valid approach for discovery of novel markers and genes for understanding the host response to dengue and, ultimately, therapeutics against dengue.",
