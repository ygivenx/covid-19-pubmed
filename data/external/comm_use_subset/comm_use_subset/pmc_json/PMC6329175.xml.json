            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, is highly contagious and causes enteric disease in pigs of all ages [1]. North America was free from PEDV until April 2013 when highly virulent PEDV strains, classified as non-S INDEL PEDV strains, suddenly emerged and spread quickly throughout the United States (US) [2, 3]. The major clinical signs of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are diarrhea and vomiting. The mortality rates were high (50\u2013100%) in neonatal piglets born into PEDV na\u00efve sows [4]. Although milder clinical signs were seen in older pigs, such as weaned pigs and sows, their growth and reproductive performance were adversely impacted [5, 6]. In the US, the economic impact was the highest during 2013\u20132014, including the deaths of 10% of the total piglet population and $0.9\u20131.8 billion in losses [7]. Subsequently, the incidence of new PEDV cases showed a seasonal pattern, peaking during winter [8]. This suggests that epidemic PEDV outbreaks have decreased and PEDV infections may be mostly endemic in the US. Currently, PEDV infection occurs in at least 39 US states and some US sow herds suffer from chronic losses (https://www.aasv.org/Resources/PEDv/PEDvWhatsNew.php). Effective vaccine programs are required, but still under development [9].",

            "text": "It is well documented that natural infections and/or live attenuated vaccines elicit local mucosal immunity against enteric virus replication in the intestinal mucosa. In enteric virus-infected and recovered pregnant sows, gut-derived IgA immunocytes (B memory cells) migrate to the mammary glands and produce high titers of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies (Ab) in colostrum and milk (via the gut-mammary-sIgA axis), contributing to passive lactogenic immunity that protects neonatal suckling piglets from the disease [10, 11]. Several live attenuated PEDV vaccines, based on classical PEDV strains, such as CV777 [12], DR13 [13] and 83P-5 [14], have been used in Asia for decades. However, their protection against the emerging highly virulent PEDV strains was questionable [15, 16] because severe PED outbreaks occurred in regularly vaccinated farms. In the US, there are two conditionally licensed PEDV vaccines based on the emerging highly virulent PEDV strains, an inactivated vaccine (Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) and an alphavirus-based PEDV subunit vaccine (Merck, Ames, IA). However, after vaccination of PEDV na\u00efve gilts/sows, neither vaccine induced high protection rates against PED in neonatal pigs [9]. One possible reason is that intramuscular injection of inactivated or subunit PEDV vaccine mainly stimulates systemic, but not mucosal immunity [11, 17]. PEDV-specific immunity in sows recovered from previous PEDV infection can be boosted by vaccination with the inactivated vaccine to induce sufficient levels of lactogenic immunity to protect their piglets [18]. In the field, intentional infection of sows with autogenous PEDV during gestation (feedback exposure) was used to induce lactogenic immunity in sows to protect piglets [9, 19]. However, this feedback exposure has a risk of spreading other infectious agents to the entire herd and PEDV infection may become persistent on farms. Therefore, a live attenuated vaccine based on the emerging highly virulent PEDV strains that can prime mucosal immunity is urgently needed but has not been developed in the US.",

PC22A P100 and the above passages showed various degrees of cell culture adaptation in vitro and virulence attenuation in vivo. Compared with the highly attenuated P160, the less attenuated P120 replicated more efficiently in neonatal piglets and induced a higher protection rate against challenge with the highly virulent homologous virus. It is well documented that weaned pigs and sows are less susceptible to PEDV infection than neonatal piglets [6, 21, 22]. Many highly attenuated PEDV/ porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains replicated poorly and induced marginal immunity in weaned pigs and sows [23\u201325]. Because the evaluation of vaccine candidates in sows is very expensive and labor-intensive, young pigs, such as weaned pigs, can be used as a surrogate model to initially evaluate the safety, immune responses and protection efficacy of PEDV vaccine candidates [9]. Therefore, the aims of this study were to characterize the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of two PEDV vaccine candidates, P100C4 and P120 of the PEDV PC22A strain, in weaned pigs.",

However, these requirements were usually mutually exclusive when attenuated vaccines were developed by using traditional cell culture methods alone. Previous studies reported that pigs orally or oronasally inoculated with attenuated PEDV [26], TEGV [27, 28] or rotavirus [29] strains developed lower protective immunity than pigs infected with the corresponding virulent virus. In TGEV naive sows, only oral inoculation with virulent TGEV or with multi doses of attenuated TGEV vaccines induced passive protection in the nursing pigs [10, 11]. In this study, pigs inoculated with virulent PEDV PC22A P3 developed complete protective immunity against subsequent challenge with a high dose of the homologous virus. Although one pig in the P120 group had diarrhea (FC = 2) at 1\u20132 dpi when its fecal PEDV RNA shedding was extremely low (4.9 log10 copies/mL at 1 dpi) or undetectable (at 2 dpi), diarrhea probably cannot be attributable to P120 infection. So, neither the attenuated PC22A-P100C4 nor the P120 caused disease in 40-day-old weaned pigs, fulfilling the safety requirement for a vaccine. On the other hand, one dose of P100C4 or P120 did not induce sufficient immunity to protect the pigs from diarrhea post challenge. The optimal stimulation of mucosal immune responses requires local virus replication and adequate amounts of viral antigens present for a sufficient period of time. The ability of the virus to replicate in intestinal epithelial cells and the dose of virus inoculum are two critical factors [17, 23]. The short duration of fecal PEDV RNA shedding indicates that P100C4 and P120 replicated to a more limited extent in weaned pigs than P3. The inoculum dose [6 log10 plaque formation unit (PFU) per pig] used for P100C4 and P120 viruses was similar to that (12 log10 copies/mL, corresponding to 6 log10 PFU) for the virulent PEDV PC21A strain, which was isolated from the same PEDV outbreak as the PC22A strain [30]. Whether a higher dose than the current 6 log10 PFU per pig and/or multiple doses of P100C4 and P120 would enhance the protection efficiency should be examined in the future.",

P100C4- and P120-inoculated piglets had milder villous atrophy, delayed onset and shortened duration of fecal PEDV RNA shedding compared with P3-inoculated piglets. Furthermore, P120 was more attenuated than P100C4 based on longer incubation time, lower fecal virus shedding titers and more limited viral antigen distribution in the intestines. In this study, P3 was still virulent, and P100C4 and P120 were completely attenuated in weaned pigs, probably due to all age-dependent resistance to disease in weaned versus neonatal piglets [21, 22]. P100C4 and P120 did not show substantial differences in pathogenicity as neither P100C4 nor P120 caused clinical signs in weaned pigs. Besides, in one of the six pigs in P100C4 group productive infection was not established, suggesting that host-related variability in susceptibility to PEDV probably contributed to this result. However, these three viruses differ significantly in immunogenicity. In the P100C4 group, but not the P120 group, titers of serum PEDV IgA, IgG and VN Ab and the numbers of PEDV IgA ASCs were boosted significantly after the P3 challenge. In addition, fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers in the P100C4 group decreased earlier than those in the mock and P120 groups post challenge. These results suggest that P100C4 infection induced stronger primary and anamnestic immune responses. However, the P120-inoculated pigs had lower serum PEDV Ab titers than those inoculated with P3 or PC100C4 post inoculation. After the challenge with P3, anamnestic immune responses in the P120 group were marginal. Interestingly, serum secondary Ab responses in the P3 group were lower than those in the P100C4 group, although the number of ileum IgA ASCs was significantly higher in the P3 group than the P100C4 group. Because intestinal IgA Ab is generally considered as the most relevant to protection against PEDV infection [11, 17]. It is likely that pigs inoculated with virulent P3 developed sufficient intestinal mucosal immune responses to efficiently neutralize the challenge virus and prevent virus replication, corresponding with low fecal PEDV RNA shedding and no disease. On the other hand, even attenuated P100C4 elicited some IgA and IgG Ab response at 14 and 21 dpi, it did not provide weaned pigs with sufficient mucosal protection against virulent P3 challenge. So the replication of the challenge virus in pigs of the P100C4 group induced higher serum secondary immune responses than in the P3 group.",

            "text": "Two previous studies compared the immune responses induced by virulent and attenuated PEDV in 11-day-old and 5-week-old conventional pigs, respectively [23, 24]. In general, the virulent PEDV provided higher levels of protective immunity than the attenuated strains. None of the virulent PEDV-inoculated pigs developed clinical signs after challenge with the homologous virus. However, different attenuated viruses induced various protection rates. In the study of attenuated PEDV CV777 strain [23], 0, 12.5 and 46% of pigs in high dose group [5.4 \u00d7 106 fluorescent focus formation unit (FFU)/pig], low dose group (2.55 \u00d7 105 FFU/pig), and mock group, respectively, developed diarrhea after virulent CV777 challenge (unknown dose) at 21 dpi. In the study of attenuated PEDV PT strain [24], 100% (3/3) of mock-inoculated pigs developed watery diarrhea after challenge with 5.0 \u00d7 105 TCID50/pig of virulent PEDV PT-P5 at 4 wks post inoculation, while none (0/6) of attenuated PEDV PT-P96-inoculated pigs developed diarrhea after challenge. In this study, all the pigs in the P100C4, P120, and mock groups showed diarrhea after challenge with the P3 virus (5.6 log10 PFU/pig) at 24 dpi. Overall, different virus strains and pig conditions (ages, sources of pigs, breed etc.) used by different laboratories may contribute to the variable protection rates. In addition, we did not investigate PEDV-specific cellular immune responses that may play an important role in protection against PEDV challenge. More studies on T cell immune responses to PEDV infection in the future will provide a more complete picture of protective immunity and better guidance for PEDV vaccine development.",

            "text": "The long-term goal of our study is to develop safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccines targeting sows to generate lactogenic immunity to protect neonatal piglets from PED. In this study, conventional weaned pigs were used to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the vaccine candidates because of three reasons: 1) previous studies suggest that young pigs can be used as a surrogate model to evaluate potential sow vaccines, 2) it is more economical compared with using sows to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate, and 3) weaned pigs are potential targets for vaccination for active immunity agaist PED [9]. Two partially attenuated PEDV vaccine candidates, PC22A-P100C4 and -P120, replicated to a lower extent than the P3 virus and caused no disease in weaned pigs. However, concerns remain because the attenuated PEDV strains may revert to virulence via mutation in the natural hosts or generate new virulent strains by exchanging their genes with field strains via recombination. With the development of reverse genetics technology [31, 32], virus with limited replication competency and defective in recombination can be engineered to alleviate this concern in the future. On the other hand, both PC22A-P100C4 and -P120 induced insufficient immune responses to protect pigs from the challenge with a high dose of virulent virus. After the challenge, only P100C4-, but not P120-, inoculated pigs developed strong anamnestic Ab responses. Considering the fact that feedback method using highly virulent PEDV viruses may facilitate the spread of other infectious agents in the herds and PEDV persistence on farms, and inactivated/subunit PEDV vaccine is mainly effective in previously PEDV-exposed but not PEDV-naive sows, a safe and efficacious live attenuated PEDV vaccine is still urgently needed. However, our results demonstrate the difficulties and challenges in the development of live attenuated vaccines using cell culture adaptation method alone. With the availability of an infectious clone system for PEDV [31], the P100C4 can be further modified to enhance its immunogenicity and maintain its attenuation. The combination of attenuated (such as P100C4) and inactivated vaccines, and/or the inclusion of mucosal adjuvants may be a safe and effective PEDV vaccination regimen as confirmed for TGEV sow vaccines [28]. All of these hypotheses can be investigated in the future.",

Different amounts of live MNCs (5 \u00d7 105, 5 \u00d7 104, 5 \u00d7 103 and 5 \u00d7 102) from each tissue were added to duplicate wells. Plates were centrifuged at 120 x g for 5 min and incubated for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Subsequently, the plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). The Ab production was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled affinity-purified goat anti-pig IgA antibodies (KPL, Maryland) diluted 1:4000 in PBST and incubated for 2 h at RT. Finally, the spots were developed by tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with H2O2 membrane peroxidase substrate system (KPL). Counts were averaged from duplicate wells. Data were expressed as the mean number of ASCs per 5 \u00d7 105 MNCs [37].",
