Currently, two genera: namely Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus are distinguished within this family. The genus Mamastrovirus includes astrovirus species isolated from humans and a number of mammals. Isolates originated from avian species, such as turkey, chickens, ducks, and other birds are classified into the genus Avastrovirus1, 2. AstVs have been detected in humans and a variety of animal species, including non-human primates, other mammals and avian species3\u20135. Their genomes are 6.8\u20137.9 kb in length, consisting of a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), three open reading frames (ORFs), a 3\u2032-UTR and a poly (A) tail6. The high degree of genetic diversity among AstVs and their recombination potential signify their capacity to cause a broad spectrum of diseases in multiple host species3, 7, 8. Human classical AstVs are a frequent cause of acute gastroenteritis in young children and the elderly, occasionally with encephalitis8.",

Increasing evidence indicates that there is a high degree of cross species transmission of AstVs between domestic birds, and even the potential to infect humans17. By comparison, fewer AstV infection cases have been described in domestic goose flocks. Bidin et al.18 reported the detection of avian nephritis virus infection in Croatian goose flocks and provided evidence that this AstV was associated with stunting and pre-hatching mortality of goose embryos. Studies to detect AstV genomes from the clinical samples of geese suggested that these viruses might distribute widely among goose flocks, as seen in other poultry flocks19, 20. In February 2017, an outbreak of disease was reported in a goose farm in Weifang, Shandong Province, China. Affected flocks (containing 2000\u20133000 goslings) experienced continuous mortality rates ranging from 20 to 30% during the first 2 weeks of the outbreak despite antibiotic and supportive treatment. We conducted a systematic investigation to identify the causative agent of this disease and report here the isolation and characterization of a genetically distinct avian AstV. The pathogenicity of this virus was evaluated by experimental infection of goslings.",

However, a DNA fragment was amplified from the RNA sample extracted from the pooled spleen, liver and kidney tissues using pan-AstV RT-PCR targeting the AstV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene21. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the amplified RdRp gene with other known AstV sequences retrieved in the GenBank database showed that the detected virus could be assigned to the subgroup 1.2 within the avastrovius group 1, with the closest relationship to the astrovirus detected from dropping samples of northern shovelers (Anas clypeata) in Hong Kong (Fig. 2)22. However, the nucleotide sequence of the RdRp gene had \u226467.5% similarity to the sequences of other astroviruses within avastrovirus group 1, suggesting that the virus was genetically distinct from known avastroviruses. Therefore, the isolation of AstV was initiated by inoculating tissue samples into goose embryos. For the first inoculation, significant thickening of the embryo\u2019s chorioallantoic membrane was noted although no death occurred by 5 days post inoculation (dpi). The subsequent passage of the isolate caused 60\u2013100% mortality of the embryos by 5 dpi. The dead embryos exhibited severe subcutaneous edema and hemorrhages with necrotic foci in the liver (Fig. 3). Using the gene specific RT-PCR, the AstV was consistently detected in the allantoic fluids. Quantal assays showed that the infectious virus titers of the embryo allantoic fluid increased from 5 \u00d7 104 ELD50/ml for the fourth passage to 5 \u00d7 105.5 ELD50/ml for the 9th passage, indicating that the isolates adapted to the goose embryo culture system. Therefore, the isolate was designated AAstV/Goose/CHN/2017/SD01 (SD01 hereafter) as proposed by Martella et al.23.",

As is the case with other known avian AstVs, there was an overlapping region between ORF1a and ORF1b (3247\u20133265 nt), which contains the highly conserved ribosome frameshift sequence (5\u2032-AAAAAAC-3\u2032) and a downstream hairpin structure (3270\u20133295 nt) as predicted by RNA folding analysis. ORF1b was 1560 nt long and was predicted to encode a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. There was an 18 nt spacer between the stop codon of ORF1b and the start codon of ORF2. ORF2 was 2133 nt long encoding a capsid protein of 704 aa. A stem-loop-II-like (s2m) motif consisting of 43 nt was revealed adjacent to 10 nt of ORF2 in the 3\u2032-UTR by Rfam analysis.",
