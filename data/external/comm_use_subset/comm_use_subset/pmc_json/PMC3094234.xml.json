For a mean difference of 24-hours in LOS between groups (power = 90%, \u03b1 = 5%) the required sample size is 23 per group. The numbers to detect a 12-hour difference in supplemental oxygen requirement is 30 per group. These are large effect sizes but more conservative estimates than seen in the Turkish study[26]. In that study,[26] the difference between groups was 30-hrs for LOS and 31-hours for supplemental oxygen requirement. Assuming similar effects, a sample size of at least 100 in each sub-age group is also sufficient for an a-priori subgroup analysis based on age (power of 90% and 2-tailed \u03b1 of 5%). If the effects are smaller, we will have an 80% power to detect a difference of 10-hours in LOS in all infants and an 80% power to detect a difference of 14-hours in LOS in the \u22646-months age group.
