The gut microbiome is influenced by several factors including diet [2], physical activity [3], use of antibiotics [4], and other lifestyle-related conditions. Studies comparing the microbiome of rural and industrialized communities have also shown that dietary and lifestyle changes linked to Westernization have played a pivotal role in the loss of many microbial taxa and in the rise of others [5\u201314]. Although it is difficult to establish causality and mechanisms for these links [15, 16], recent studies have extended the identifiable members of the human microbiome to now cover > 90% of its overall diversity [11], which is a prerequisite for advancing the understanding of the role of microbes in human physiology and metabolism.",

Ancient intestinal microbiome samples (i.e., coprolites) can give some insights on the gut microbial composition of pre-industrialized and prehistoric humans and date back to a few thousand years [17\u201321], but the time-dependent degradation issues of microbial DNA limits the possibility of profiling stool samples predating the neolithic period [22]. Some patterns of co-diversification between humans and their microbiomes can be in principle investigated by comparative and phylogenetic analysis of genomes and metagenomes in non-human primates (NHPs), the closest evolutionary relatives of humans [23]. However, a very substantial fraction of the microbiome in NHPs is currently uncharacterized, and a comprehensive comparative sequence-level analysis against human microbiomes is thus unfeasible.",

Several 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing studies investigated the microbiome composition of NHPs [24\u201332], and some, including a meta-analysis [33], investigated the overlap and specificity of microbial communities associated with humans and NHPs [34\u201336]. Yet, because this approach has a limited phylogenetic resolution and lacks functional characterization, many co-diversification aspects cannot be studied. Some studies have also applied shotgun metagenomics on NHP microbiomes [30, 37\u201341], but all of them employed a reference-based computational profiling approach, which solely allows the identification of the very few known microbial species present in NHPs, disregarding those that have not been characterized yet. However, because of the advances in metagenomic assembly [42, 43] and its application on large cohorts [11], there is now the possibility to compile a more complete catalog of species and genomes in NHP microbiomes and thus enable accurate co-diversification and comparative analyses.",

We compared the newly established catalog of NHP-associated species in the context of a large-scale human microbiome assembly project [11] to expose the overlap and divergence between the NHP and human gut microbiome. We showed that captive NHPs harbor microbial species and strains more similar to the human ones compared to wild NHPs and that the extent of microbiome overlap is strongly lifestyle-dependent. Through comparative microbiome analysis, we thus describe the loss of biodiversity from wild to captive NHP that mimics that from non-Westernized to Westernized human populations.",

This points at the paucity of microbial genomes representative for members of the gut microbiome of NHPs, which greatly overcome the unexplored diversity still hidden in human microbiomes [45]. We thus employed an assembly-based approach we previously proposed and validated elsewhere [11] (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section) and that was also recently cross-checked with other similar efforts [46] to reconstruct microbial genomes de novo in the whole set of available NHP metagenomic samples. After single-sample assembly and contig binning of the 203 NHP metagenomes considered, we retrieved a total of 2985 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) (Additional file 5: Table S4) that exceeded the threshold for being considered of medium quality (completeness > 50% and contamination < 5%) according to recent guidelines [47]. A large fraction of these genomes (34.6%) could additionally be considered of high quality (completeness > 90% and contamination < 5%) and provide the basis for assessing the diversity of NHP microbiomes",

Comparative functional analysis between human and NHP strains was hindered by the low level of overlap between species-level genome bins (SGBs; i.e., clusters of MAGs spanning 5% genetic diversity, see the \u201cMethods\u201d section) retrieved from human and NHP metagenomes, with only 8 SGBs being present in at least 10 human and 10 NHP microbiomes. Statistical analysis on the functional annotations of these shared SGBs showed 150 KEGG Orthologies (KOs) significantly associated with NHP strains and 166 KOs associated with human strains (Fisher\u2019s test FDR-corrected p values < 0.05, Additional file 6: Table S5). Among the functions associated with NHP strains, we found different genes involved in the degradation of sugars like cellobiose (K00702, K02761) and maltose (K16211, K01232), and among those associated with human ones, genes encoding for the degradation of different antibiotic compounds, including penicillin and vancomycin (K01710, K02563, K07260, K07259), which is consistent with the exposure of humans but not NHPs to antibiotics.",

On the contrary, Actinobacteria were generally underrepresented among NHP SGBs (Fig. 1b).

The fact that LiX_2018 was already highly mappable even when using the available reference genomes alone (22.2% w.r.t. 1% of AmatoKR_2018) and that the human SGB database was responsible for the largest increase in mappability (reaching 60.7%, w.r.t. 3% of AmatoKR_2018) further confirms that microbiomes from NHPs in captivity are more similar to human ones (Fig. 1e) than those from wild hosts. Also, the TungJ_2015 dataset reached high mappability levels (63.9%), but this was expected as this is the largest dataset in our meta-analysis (23.6% of the samples considered in this study), with all samples (n = 48) from the same host. The AmatoKR_2018 cohort, on the contrary, surveyed many different wild hosts (n = 18, 95 samples) that are not covered by other datasets and that have therefore a limited sample size, explaining the modest gain in mappability (14.4% with respect to the human catalog).

Indeed, eight of the ten most prevalent human-associated SGBs found in at least five NHP samples (Additional file 9: Table S8) were recovered from the LiX_2018 and SrivathsanA_2015 datasets, the only two studies which surveyed the microbiome of NHPs in captivity. Accordingly, a high fraction of genomes reconstructed from the LiX_2018 captive dataset matches previously described species (64.2%), in contrast with an average of 7.0% \u00b1 6.0% for the MAGs in wild datasets (Additional file 9: Table S8). Overall, these numbers suggest that the microbiome of captive animals is a rather poor representation of the real diversity of their microbiome in the wild and that exposure of NHPs to the human-associated environment and somehow human-like diet and sanitary procedures can inflate the similarity between human and NHP microbiomes. Nevertheless, a few SGBs were consistently found in both wild and captive NHPs and shared with humans. These ten kSGBs and eight uSGBs mainly belonged to unclassified Firmicutes (n = 5) and uncharacterized Ruminococcus species (n = 4). Among the most prevalent in NHPs, the kSGBs of Treponema berlinense, Succinatimonas sp., Escherichia coli, and Prevotella sp. were consistently found in different host species spanning NHPs and humans and thus appear as key players in the primate gut microbiome.",

The overall Prevotellaceae family is the most prevalent in NHPs (36.55%), and its prevalence is even higher in non-Westernized human microbiomes (60.55%), while not reaching 20% in Westernized ones (Fig. 2c). Consistently, 4 out of the 20 SGBs most associated with non-Westernized human populations belonged to the Prevotella genus (SGBs 1680, 1657, 1613, 1614, Fig. 3) and were however retrieved only from the LiX_2018 dataset of captive Macaca fascicularis. Similarly, the only shared SGB assigned at the species level was Treponema succinifaciens (kSGB 3546), which was present in 8.22% of non-Westernized samples and in only 0.02% Westernized microbiomes (Fig. 3 and Additional file 10: Table S9), but all of the samples were from the 2 datasets of NHPs in captivity (LiX_2018 and SrivathsanA_2015), supporting once again the observation that when well-characterized species are found in NHPs, these are usually from captive hosts. The family Spirochaetaceae, to which the genus Treponema belongs, was however prevalent also in wild NHPs (24.37%) and non-Westernized samples (13.67%), while being almost absent in Westernized ones (0.13%, Fig. 2c). These data thus suggest that the level of similarity between human and NHP microbiomes depends not only on the host species but also on lifestyle variables that could be at least partially assessed both in NHPs (wild vs captive animals) and humans (Westernized vs non-Westernized populations).",

The distribution of pSGBs was however not homogeneous among datasets, with the LiX_2018 dataset being the one with the highest fraction of MAGs assigned to known species (23.5% of the MAGs assigned to kSGBs) and AmatoKR_2018 having 97.23% of the MAGs unassigned at the species level (56.57% unassigned at the family level, Fig. 1d). This again reflects the different composition of the two datasets, with the captive Macaca fascicularis of the LiX_2018 dataset fed with specific human-like diets [39] and the AmatoKR_2018 dataset spanning 18 NHP species living in the wild, which explains its high diversity (Fig. 1a).",

The majority of these pSGBs unassigned even at the genus level or above were placed, based on genome similarity, into the 2 highly abundant human gut microbiome phyla of the Firmicutes (44.2% of the unassigned pSGBs, 514 total MAGs) and Bacteroidetes (30.9% of the unassigned pSGBs, 458 MAGs) with smaller fractions assigned to Proteobacteria (9.7%, 125 MAGs), Actinobacteria (5.5%, 108 MAGs), and Spirochaetes (2.8%, 37 MAGs). Because the dominance of the Bacteroides and Firmicutes phyla is quite consistent among the gut microbiomes of primates, it is thus at the species and genus level that most of the inter-host diversity is occurring, possibly as a consequence of host co-speciation or co-diversification evolutionary dynamics.",

Eight of the 10 most prevalent GGBs in NHP samples were part of this novel set of GGBs and were assigned to Coriobacteriales (36 MAGs), Bacteroidaceae (36 MAGs), and Prevotellaceae (33 MAGs) families. Among the most prevalent, only the 2 Treponema GGBs (42 MAGs from NHPs) were known and shared with humans (52 MAGs), mainly from non-Westernized populations (38 MAGs, Fig. 2b and Additional file 11: Table S10). On the contrary, all of the 10 most prevalent families were previously known and shared with humans (Additional file 11: Table S10).

By using a phylogenetic modeling based on 400 single-copy universal markers [55], we reconstructed the phylogeny and the corresponding genetic ordination analysis of the 5 most relevant shared FGBs (Fig. 2c), which included 3 known families (Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Spirochaetaceae), and 2 unexplored FGBs assigned to the Actinobacteria phylum and the Clostridiales order. We observed the presence of both intra-family host-specific clusters (Fig. 4a) and clusters comprising genomes spanning human and non-human hosts. The phylogeny of the Bacteroidetes reconstructed to include all of the MAGs and reference genomes for the 10 most prevalent characterized (kSGBs), uncharacterized (uSGBs), and newly reconstructed NHP-specific (pSGBs) species assigned to this phylum (Fig. 4b and Additional file 2: Figure S2) further confirms the presence of closely related sister clades one of which is specific to wild NHPs and the other spanning multiple hosts, including NHPs in captivity. This likely reflects a complex evolutionary pattern in which vertical co-diversification [56, 57], independent niche selection, and between-host species transmission are likely all simultaneously shaping the members of the gut microbiome of primates.\n",

The phylum was clearly divided into two main clades (Additional file 2: Figure S4), with one including strains mostly from environmental sources or non-mammalian hosts and the other (already reported in Fig. 4c) comprising all the MAGs from humans, NHPs, rumen, and the type strain of Elusimicrobium minutum [59]. The genomes from wild NHPs belonged to an unknown SGB detected also in humans (uSGB 19690) and to 2 pSGBs (pSGBs 20223 and 20224) not found in human hosts. These 2 NHP-specific Elusimicrobia are sister clades of a relatively prevalent human-associated SGB (SGB 19694 comprising 64 MAGs from humans, Fig. 4c). Such closely related but host-specific sister clades might again reflect the evolutionary divergence of the hosts, while the presence of Elusimicrobia strains from macaques in captivity inside human-associated SGBs (Fig. 4c) also confirms that these microbes can colonize different primate hosts.",

These included starch and sucrose metabolism, glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism, methane and sulfur metabolism, folate biosynthesis, and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis (Additional file 2: Figure S5), consistently with the nutrients and carbon sources available in the 2 different body sites. Focusing on the intestinal species, the SGBs in this family were quite host-specific, with genomes recovered from different hosts clustering in specific subtrees (Fig. 5a). This is for instance the case of uSGB 3548 and pSGB 21240 that, despite being phylogenetically related, were found only in humans and NHPs, respectively (Additional file 12: Table S11). Treponema succinifaciens (kSGB 3546) was instead an exception, as it was possible to reconstruct genomes for this species both from NHP microbiomes (11 MAGs) and (mostly) non-Westernized human stool microbiomes (45 MAGs, Fig. 5a, Additional file 12: Table S11). However, the closely related uSGB 3545 was recovered only from NHPs (Papio cynocephalus) and could represent a species specifically adapted to the gut of these NHPs or the consequence of the host speciation. It is quite striking that only 11 Treponema MAGs were available from Westernized stool samples despite the large number of gut metagenomes analyzed for this category (7443 stool samples), whereas the same microbial genus was very prevalent in non-Westernized datasets (13.72% of non-Westernized samples, all but one non-Westernized datasets, Fig. 5a and Additional file 6: Table S5). This raises the hypothesis that Treponema species might have been living within the gut of their primate hosts for a long time and have remained with humans in the absence of lifestyle changes associated with urbanization [22].\n",

When comparing the functional potential across hosts, we found for example that human strains were enriched for genes necessary for galactose metabolism (ko00052) and NHPs strains were instead encoding the pathway for the degradation of glucuronate-containing polymers (ko00040), highly present in hemicellulose (Fig. 5d), consistently with the different nutritional regimes of humans and NHPs. Treponema species enriched in NHPs were however including a substantially lower number of annotated functions (1312 \u00b1 375 in NHPs w.r.t. 1426 \u00b1 423 UniRef50 in Westernized samples), pointing to the need of future efforts to experimentally characterize the genes in under-investigated NHP species. The Treponema genus overall appears to be a key member of the primate-wide gut microbiome, and for this reason, its striking disappearance in human Westernized populations suggests that changes in recent lifestyle variables might be responsible for the disruption of intestinal microbes possibly coevolving with our body since the evolutionary era of primate host diversification.",

Through the application of strain-level single-sample de novo genome assembly on 203 NHP metagenomic samples, we uncovered over 1000 new SGBs expanding the catalog of microbial species recovered from non-human primates by 77% and improving the mappability of NHP metagenomes by over 600%. These newly assembled genomes contributed to the identification of 760 new genus-level and 265 family-level genome bins that represent completely uncharacterized microbial clades never observed in humans. Compared to the over 150,000 MAGs available from human metagenomes [11] and because of multiple primate hosts that need to be studied, the NHP microbiome still remains undersampled.",

Captive NHPs exposed to more human-like environments and diets showed instead higher species sharing with humans (49%) and a higher degree of metagenome mappability. On the other hand, microbiomes from wild NHPs overlapped comparatively much more (163%) with human populations adopting non-Westernized rather than Westernized lifestyles. Because lifestyle patterns appear to have an impact on the structure of the gut microbiome comparable in effect size to that of the primate host species, NHP and potentially ancient microbiome samples [17\u201321] are thus more suitable for host-microbe coevolutionary analyses as they are likely less confounded by recent lifestyle changes.",

Our framework can thus be exploited to study inter-host species and zoonotic microbial transmission that is currently mostly limited to specific pathogens of interest [73\u201378].

All but 1 study produced gut metagenomes of 1 single host species. One work [41] instead analyzed the gut microbiome of 18 species of wild NHPs from 9 countries (Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Table S1) to test the influence of folivory on its composition and function and highlighted that host phylogeny has a stronger influence than diet. With a similar approach, [30] shotgun sequenced 19 wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Republic of the Congo as part of a 16S rRNA study including sympatric chimpanzees and modern human microbiomes that demonstrated the compositional divergence between the primate clades\u2019 microbiome and the seasonal shift in response to changing dietary habits throughout the year. Orkin et al. [40] exposed similar seasonal patterns linked with water and food availability by surveying the microbiome of 20 wild white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Costa Rica. Tung et al. [37] instead found that social group membership and networks are good predictors of the taxonomic and functional structure of the gut microbiome by surveying 48 wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus) in Kenya. Studies in captivity instead include [38], who sequenced the gut microbiome of 2 red-shanked doucs langurs (Pygathrix nemaeus) in captivity that were fed a specific mix of plants to test for the ability of metabarcoding vs metagenomics to identify the plants eaten by the primates from the feces, and [39], who surveyed the change in microbiome composition and function in 20 cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) fed either a high-fat and low-fiber or a low-fat and high-fiber diet and showed that the first provoked a change toward a more human-like microbiome. Despite the relevance of these 6 works, none of them attempted at reconstructing novel microbial genomes from NHPs.",

Quality control with CheckM 1.0.7 [83] yielded 1033 high-quality MAGs (completeness > 90%, contamination < 5% as described in [11]) and 1952 medium-quality MAGs (completeness > 50% and contamination < 5%). Extensive validation of the MAG reconstruction procedure employed here has been previously validated in [11] by comparing MAGs with isolate genomes obtained from the very same biological sample, including different bacterial species and sample types. This analysis showed that genomes recovered through metagenomic assembly are, at least for the tested cases, almost identical to those obtained with isolate sequencing. Moreover, the specific choices for the use of assemblers, binners, and quality control procedures and of their parameters was proven sound with respect to similar efforts using only partially overlapping methodologies by independent investigations [46].",

The mapping was performed with BowTie2 [93] v. 2.3.5 in end-to-end mode. The mapping was performed incrementally (i.e., reads that are reported to map against pSGBs do not map against any reference genome or human SGB). Additionally, BowTie2 alignments scoring less than \u2212 20 (tag AS:i) were excluded, to avoid overestimating the number of mapping reads.
