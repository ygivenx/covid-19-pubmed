It is the major causative pathogen of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) which is a common exanthematous and febrile disease in children. But for some patients especially in children under 5 years old, EV71 can cause severe complications, including myocarditis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary oedema or haemorrhage, and even fatality. The underlying mechanisms of serious cerebral and pulmonary complications and even death are not very clear. And up to now, no specific vaccines, effective antiviral agents or therapies against EV71 infection are available [3]. Therefore, the needs of better understanding the mechanism of EV71 pathogenesis are warranted.",

In the cytoplasm, cleavage of pre-miRNA by Dicer proteins yields a mature miRNA of approximately 22 nucleotides [6]. Then, the mature miRNAs bind to 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032 UTR) of target mRNAs, which is able to recruit target mRNA and initiate mRNA degradation or translation inhibition [7]. Therefore, a large number of diverse biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, immune response, differentiation, metabolic processes and cellular response to stress are regulated [4,8-10].",

On one hand, miRNAs encoded by human cells could directly affect the virus replication. On the other hand, virus could change cell normal functions by influencing cellular gene expressions through miRNAs. To identify cellular miRNAs involved in the host response to EV71 infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis mechanism of EV71 virus, miRNAs profiles in the EV71-infected cells were examined in this study. The differences in expression levels were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. The computational methods were further performed to identify potential targets of dysregulated miRNAs, With gene ontology (GO) and KEGG biological pathway analysis, several pathways were enriched. These results may enhance our understanding on the prevention and treatment of hand-foot-and-mouth disease caused by EV71.",

            "text": "Recently, the roles of miRNAs in pathogen-host interactions have been paid more attention than before. Not only the miRNAs encoded by virus but also cellular miRNAs have been proven to participate in the interactions. Through remodelling cellular miRNAs expression, viruses influence cellular microenvironment and metabolism, which are likely to play a very important role in the viral pathogenesis. To date, a few studies have already been done to explore the effects of miRNAs in EV71 infection, inferring that miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection. By using deep sequencing, Cui [13] revealed that certain miRNAs might be essential in the EV71 infection. The research results of Li et al. suggested that miRNA-548 regulates host antiviral response via direct targeting of IFN-\u03bb1 [14]. Using a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT29) based EV71 infection model, Lui et al. showed that knockdown of DGCR8, an essential cofactor for microRNAs biogenesis, resulted in a reduction of EV71 replication [15]. Zhang [16] has demonstrated that miR-27a may have antiviral activity against EV71 by inhibiting EGFR. Zheng et al. provned that hsa-miR-296-5p suppressed EV71 replication by targeting the viral genome [17]. And Wen et al. reported that miR-23b inhibited EV71 replication by down-regulating EV71 VPl protein [18]. Recently, Bian et al. [19] compared the miRNA profiles between interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 treated RD cells and EV71-infected RD cells. miR-124 and miR-491-3p were regulated in opposite manners by the IFNs and EV71. Wnt signaling cascade, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)/PDGF, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were predicted in both EV71 infection and IFN treatment. These results indicated that cellular miRNAs participated in the virus life cycle as critical host factors by targeting the downstream genes or signaling pathways. The identified miRNAs and signal transduction patyway would be helpful to understand the interaction between the virus and host.",

Hsa-miR-4530 was validated as a miRNA marker that differentiated pancreato-biliary cancers from other clinical conditions including healthy controls, non-malignant abnormalities, and other types of cancers [20]. Hsa-miR-4459 could decrease the expression of its targets, CDC20B and ATG13, and thus altered stemness via cell cycle and autophagy in human embryonic stem cells [21]. Hsa-miR-494-3p, a well-known miRNA, plays different roles in different malignancies and was found to be implicated in multiple cell processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion. For example, miR-494-3p was found to be act as a cancer gene that could promote glioma cell proliferation through the down-expression of PTEN, a tumor-suppressor gene [22,23]. While miR-494 acts as an antioncogene in gastric carcinoma by targeting c-myc in gastric cancer [24,25]. Furthermore, hsa-miR-638 has previously been reported to be associated with virus infection. Up-expression of hsa-miR-638 was identified by microarray technology in chikungunya virus infection in human cells [26]. Kumar et al. [27] reported hsa-miR-638 decreased the levels of HBV transcripts or HBV gene products. Liu et al. [28] demonstrated inhibition of hsa-miR- 638 slightly increased HCV entry during in vitro acute HCV infection. But all of the 8 miRNAs including hsa-miR-4530, hsa-miR-4492, hsa-miR-6125, hsa-miR-494-3p, hsa-miR-638, hsa-miR-6743-5p, hsa-miR-4459 and hsa-miR-4443 were found to be related with EV71 infection for the first time. This may provide new clues for EV71 infection research.",

            "text": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are a family of protein kinases responsible for phosphorylating serine and threonine in many proteins [29]. It is widely conserved in eukaryotes and involved in many cellular functions such as inflammation, cell proliferation, differentiation, movement and death [30-32]. Three major MAPK signaling pathways have been identified, including extracellular regulated kinases (ERK1/2), JNK(JNK1/2) and p38 MAPK (p38 \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3/\u03b4). It has been reported that JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signal pathways plays an important role in response to infection and replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, encephalomyocarditis virus, coxsackievirus B3, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [33-36]. The diverse effects of activates signaling cascades include induction of apoptosis in infected cells and enhancement of viral replication. MEK1 is crucial in the ERK signaling cascade and is required to promote EV71 replication [37]. EV71 infection induces the up-regulated gene expressions of MAPK signaling pathway such as ERK, JNK and PI3K/AKT, which may be associated with the secretions of inflammatory cytokines and host cell apoptosis, which might be implicated in CNS inflammation and disorders such as encephalitis or meningitis [38]. Similarly, Tung et al. [39] domenstrated that cellular ERK levels have been shown to be the major causal factor for upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by EV71 infection which may participate in EV71-induced CNS damage. COX-2 and its metabolite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which are considered a tumor biomarker [40], are up-regulated by EV71 infection via the activated c-Src/PDGFR/PI3K/Akt/p42/p44 MAPK/AP1 and NF-\u03baB pathways in rat brain astrocytes [41]. These evidence together with our study supports the notion that MAPK signalling cascade as key moleculars in EV71 replication cycle and pathogenesis.",

The small RNAs(<300 nt) were 3\u2032-extended with a poly(A) tail using poly(A) polymerase. An oligonucleotide tag was then ligated to the poly(A) tail for later fluorescent dye staining. Hybridization was performed overnight on a \u03bcParaflo microfluidic chip using a micro-circulation pump (Atactic Technologies) [42]. On the microfluidic chip, each detection probe consisted of a chemically modified nucleotide coding segment complementary to target microRNA from miRBase and a spacer segment of polyethylene glycol to extend the coding segment away from the substrate. The detection probes were made by in situ synthesis using PGR (photogenerated reagent) chemistry. The hybridization melting temperatures were balanced by chemical modifications of the detection probes. The hybridization buffer was 100 \u03bcL 6 \u00d7 SSPE buffer (0.90 M NaCl, 60 mM Na2HPO4, 6 mM EDTA, pH 6.8) containing 25% formamide at 34\u00b0C.
