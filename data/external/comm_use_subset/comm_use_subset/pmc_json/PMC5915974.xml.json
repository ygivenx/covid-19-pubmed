In other instances, such as for Legionnaires\u2019 disease, countries were grouped according to ECDC disease programme expert opinion into higher, intermediate and lower surveillance system sensitivity and different multiplication factors were then applied for each sensitivity group. The sensitivity of surveillance systems does not only depend on their intrinsic characteristics; systems are also prone to temporary changes, for example, during outbreaks, when increased awareness might also increase willingness and capacity to detect and report cases. For the estimation of the incidence of measles, for example, notification of cases from countries and years experiencing an outbreak were adjusted with a multiplication factor of 1.5 [51], as opposed to 2.5 for other countries and years [52,53].",
