They rely on the ability to differentiate between immunological \u201cself\u201d and \u201cnon-self\u201d in order to swiftly activate diverse antiviral effector mechanisms. Conceptually, sensing of virus infection is mainly mediated through recognition of viral nucleic acids, which are considered to comprise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by specialized host cell pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) [1]. Double-stranded (ds) RNA, an obligate replication intermediate of positive-stranded RNA viruses that is accumulating during replication, is known as an important PAMP within the cytoplasm of infected cells. Host cell responses to dsRNA are versatile and include the expression of IFN-I by activating RIG-I like helicases (RLRs), such as Rig-I and Mda5, the inhibition of host cell translation by activating PKR, and the degradation of viral and host cell-derived RNA by activating the OAS/RNase L pathway [2].",

They are well known to evade innate immune activation, particularly during the early phase of the infection [3\u20136]. Coronavirus innate immune evasion is multifaceted and involves ribose-2\u2019-O methylation of viral RNA, as well as compartmentalised RNA synthesis at virus-induced membrane structures comprised of convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles [7\u20139]. The importance of functions encoded by the CoV replicase gene is further exemplified by non-structural protein (nsp) 1 that suppresses host gene expression by mediating host mRNA degradation [10, 11], and nsp3 that contains a papain-like proteinase with deubiquitination activity interfering with IFN-I host cell responses [12, 13]. In addition, a number of accessory gene functions, although less conserved, have been described to target downstream events of innate immune activation, such as a phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity encoded by some coronavirus strains, which degrades 2\u2019,5\u2019-oligoadenylate messenger molecules essential for RNase L activation [14, 15].",

            "text": "Here we addressed a possible role of the highly conserved coronavirus EndoU activity in innate immune evasion. The EndoU domain is harboured in non-structural protein (nsp) 15 that is considered as an integral component of the coronaviral replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC)[16\u201319]. By using immunofluorescence microscopy analyses in HCoV-229E-infected cells with a HCoV-229E-nsp15-specific monoclonal antibody the characteristic perinuclear staining pattern known from various other CoV nsps was reported [19]. For MHV-A59, a similar study reports MHV-nsp15-specific perinuclear puncta that were detected using an MHV-nsp15-specific rabbit antiserum that partially overlapped with MHV nucleocapsid staining in MHV-A59-infected cells [20, 21]. Moreover, MHV nsp15 was shown to co-localize with viral RNA and to fractionate in similar fractions as other nsps following MHV infection [21, 22]. Notably, upon ectopic expression of a fusion protein comprised of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and MHV-nsp15, a pattern of cytoplasmic speckles, distinct from the characteristic pattern of the CoV replicase complex was observed, suggesting that the localization of ectopically expressed nsp15 or GFP-nsp15 fusion proteins may differ from the localization of nsp15 that is expressed in the context of the CoV polyprotein 1ab [20]. The CoV EndoU has uridylate-specific endonucleolytic activity on single-stranded and dsRNA[17] and is related to (i) cellular enzymes prototyped by XendoU[16, 23] and (ii) viral homologs conserved in all nidoviruses known to infect vertebrate hosts including fish, birds and mammals, suggesting an important role for this enzyme in an ancient cellular pathway. Over the past years, a wealth of structural and biochemical information has been obtained for EndoU. However, the precise role of this virus-encoded nucleolytic activity in coronavirus/nidovirus replication remains enigmatic [17, 18, 24\u201326]. Surprisingly, although EndoU is coexpressed with other key replicative proteins as part of the viral replicase polyprotein, its enzymatic activity is not essential for viral RNA synthesis in most cell culture systems[26]. In this work we illustrate a pronounced impact of the coronavirus EndoU activity on innate immune evasion. Specifically, we show that genetically engineered mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respectively, that encode an EndoU active-site substitution known to abolish nucleolytic activity, were severely attenuated and elicited an immediate and simultaneous activation of host cell dsRNA sensors.",

Replication of MHVH277A was reduced in L929 cells, but peak titers almost reached those of wild-type MHV-A59, confirming that the coronavirus EndoU activity is dispensable for virus replication in vitro (Fig 1B)[25, 26]. In sharp contrast, compared to wild-type MHV-A59, the EndoU-deficient MHVH277A was severely attenuated in vivo (Fig 1C). MHVH277A replication was not detectable in spleen and liver of C57BL/6 mice at two days post intraperitoneal infection with 500 plaque-forming units (pfu), demonstrating that the EndoU activity is required for efficient replication and spread in vivo. Notably, replication and spread of MHVH277A was partly restored in mice deficient for the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR), with viral titers of MHVH277A in the spleen and liver of IFNAR-deficient mice that did not reach those of MHV-A59. Interestingly, concerning the role of Mda5 and TLR7, which are known as main cytoplasmic and endosomal PRRs for coronaviral RNA, respectively, MHVH277A replication was not restored in Mda5-deficient, TLR7-deficient, or Mda5- and TLR7-deficient mice. This phenotype clearly differs from that described for coronaviruses that lack ribose-2\u2019-O methyl-transferase (OMT) activity [9]. Thus, in experiments reported previously, we found that replication of OMT-deficient MHV (MHVD130A) is restored in mice that are deficient for Mda5 and TLR7, suggesting that lack of ribose-2\u2019-O methylation is tolerated if these two RNA sensors are absent. The lack of any detectable replication of the EndoU-deficient MHVH277A in Mda5- and TLR7-deficient mice therefore indicates that Mda5- and TLR7-mediated IFN-I expression may not exclusively restrict MHVH277A replication and that other mechanisms contribute to the observed attenuation of MHVH277A replication.",

Moreover, replication of MHVH277A was even more severely reduced in bone marrow-derived murine macrophages, and accompanied by early induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression (Fig 2B and 2C). Notably, levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA were only transiently (6 to 12 h.p.i.) elevated in MHVH277A compared to MHV-A59 infected macrophages, and declined along with viral titers and viral RNA during the late phase of infection. Likewise, replication of the EndoU-deficient HCoV-229EH250A was severely restricted in human blood-derived macrophages (Fig 2D). We observed significantly elevated IFN-I expression in a panel of human macrophages derived from seven individual donors after infection with HCoV-229EH250A compared to wild-type HCoV-229E infection (Fig 2D), consistent with reduced viral replication.",

Mda5 has been described as the main RNA sensor of coronavirus infection in murine macrophages [29]. Compared to wild-type macrophages, IFN-\u03b2 expression was reduced in Mda5-deficient macrophages following MHVH277A infection, as shown by qRT-PCR and IFN-\u03b2 ELISA (Fig 3A and 3D). Surprisingly, and again in contrast to the phenotype of the OMT-deficient MHVD130A [9], MHVH277A replication was not restored in Mda5-deficient macrophages (Fig 3A). Similarly, although IFN-\u03b2 expression was likewise reduced in MAVS-deficient macrophages, MHVH277A replication was not restored in MAVS-deficient macrophages (Fig 3B and 3D). Even in IRF3/IRF5/IRF7 (IRF3/5/7 -/-) triple-knockout macrophages, that display an almost negligible induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression, MHVH277A replication was not fully restored (Fig 3C and 3D). IFN-\u03b2 protein assessed by IFN-\u03b2 ELISA was below detection in all three macrophage genotypes (Mda5-/-, MAVS-/-, IRF3/5/7-/-; Fig 3D). These results indicate that MHVH277A replication is either highly sensitive to already marginal amounts of IFN-I, or that other antiviral host cell responses may contribute to the attenuation of MHVH277A.",

Importantly, IFN-\u03b2 expression was elevated in IFNAR-deficient macrophages that had been infected with MHVH277A compared to those infected with wild-type MHV-A59, demonstrating that increased expression of IFN-\u03b2 can be uncoupled from attenuation of MHVH277A (Fig 4B). We also noted that IFN-\u03b2 expression was delayed in IFNAR-deficient macrophages following MHVH277A infection compared to wild-type macrophages. This observation is in agreement with previous reports that suggested a macrophage-specific autocrine IFN-\u03b2 priming loop in wild-type macrophages enhances cytokine and chemokine expression following MHV infection [30].",

Therefore, we infected murine L929 cells and human MRC5 lung fibroblasts with MHVH277A and HCoV-229EH250A, respectively, and applied different dosages of IFN-I for 4 hours prior to infection. Compared to wild type MHV and HCoV-229E, respectively, both EndoU-deficient viruses indeed displayed a pronounced sensitivity to IFN-I pre-treatment (Fig 4C). Remarkably, MHVH277A displayed a sensitivity to IFN-I treatment that is comparable to that of the highly IFN-I sensitive OMT-deficient mutant MHVD130A (S1 Fig). However, compared to the OMT-deficient mutant MHVD130A the phenotype of the EndoU-deficient MHVH277A differs mainly in the lack of restoration of replication under conditions with strongly reduced IFN-I expression (e.g. in Mda5-/- macrophages; Fig 3A), suggesting that other, most likely IFN-I inducible, antiviral effector mechanisms account for restriction of MHVH277A replication.

However, replication of MHVH277A was not restored in Mda5-deficient macrophages. This observation prompted us to consider that replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses may activate additional dsRNA-triggered antiviral pathways. We therefore assessed the integrity of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a marker for the activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway [31], during MHVH277A infection in primary murine macrophages. Indeed, the breakdown of rRNA in MHVH277A infected wild-type macrophages was readily detectable as early as 6\u201312 h.p.i., thus coinciding with the induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression during the early phase of the infection (compare Figs 5A and 2C). This finding is highly surprising since MHV-A59 encodes a PDE activity that has been shown to degrade 2\u2019,5\u2019-oligoadenylate messenger molecules essential for RNase L activation [14]. However, the PDE activity was apparently not sufficient to prevent RNase L activation in macrophages that had been infected with EndoU-deficient MHVH277A. To exclude that the lack of EndoU activity may directly impact on viral RNA synthesis and lead to reduced levels of subgenomic mRNAs, we assessed the level of genomic and subgenomic mRNA2 (encoding the PDE activity) by qRT-PCR. As shown in S2 Fig, genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA2 were equally reduced in MHVH277A infected wild-type macrophages, suggesting that the lack of EndoU activity does not result in selective reduction of subgenomic mRNAs. Importantly, while breakdown of rRNA was also readily detectable in Mda5- and MAVS-deficient macrophages, rRNA remained intact in RNase L-deficient macrophages, demonstrating that infection of EndoU-deficient MHVH277A indeed results in the activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway and subsequent degradation of rRNA (Fig 5A; S2 Fig).",

This strongly suggests that yet another antiviral pathway, in addition to OAS/RNase L, is activated during MHVH277A infection. One obvious candidate is PKR, a kinase that can be directly activated by dsRNA to phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), resulting in translation inhibition of cellular and viral mRNAs. Indeed, as shown in Fig 6B (left panel), we readily detected phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 at 9 h.p.i.. In addition, we assessed the extent of translational inhibition at 9 h.p.i. by using puromycin and subsequent FACS analysis. As shown in Fig 6B, wild-type MHV-A59 infected cells showed active translation comparable to mock infected macrophages, while translational inhibition was observed in MHVH277A\u2013infected macrophages. Finally, we assessed replication of MHV-A59 and MHVH277A in PKR-deficient macrophages, and as shown in Fig 6C, PKR-deficiency alone was also not sufficient for the restoration of MHVH277A replication. Importantly, however, we observed elevated replication of MHVH277A in primary macrophages that are deficient for both, PKR and RNase L that almost reached that of MHV-A59 (Fig 6D) [34]. In order to more precisely analyse the degree of restoration of MHVH277A replication in IFNAR- and in RNase L/PKR-deficient macrophages, we performed a statistical analysis and compared the differences of calculated MHV-A59 and MHVH277A peak titers between C57BL/6 and IFNAR-/- (p = 0.008), between C57BL/6 and RNase L-/-/PKR-/- (p = 0.004) and between IFNAR-/- and RNase L-/-/PKR-/- (p = 0.612) (Fig 6E). This result shows that MHVH277A replication is restored to a comparable degree in IFNAR-/- and RNase L-/-/PKR-/- macrophages.",

This difference became convincingly apparent and statistically significant at 9 and 12 h.p.i. with dsRNA peaks of MHVH277A-infected cells that clearly separated from dsRNA peaks of MHV-A59-infected cells (Fig 7A and 7C, right panel). Importantly, we also controlled for virus infection by staining for the replicase complex (nsp2/3), and as shown in Fig 7C (left panel) the peaks for nsp2/3 from in MHVH277A-infected wild-type macrophages did not exceed those of MHV-A59-infected cells. We obtained essentially the same result when we assessed dsRNA and nsp2/3 by FACS analysis following infection of IFNAR-/- macrophages (Fig 7B and 7D), suggesting that dsRNA is also increased in MHVH277A-infection under conditions of reduced host cell responses.

Second, we observe breakdown of ribosomal RNA indicative of activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway that temporally coincides with IFN-\u03b2 expression. Third, we show that efficient restriction of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is furthermore dependent on PKR since restoration of EndoU-deficient MHVH277A replication required the absence of both, PKR and RNase L. Our data suggest that direct restriction of replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is mediated by RNase L-mediated RNA degradation and inhibition of host cell translation through activation of PKR. In contrast, the effect of IFN-I appears to be indirect through the induction of ISG expression, that includes OAS/RNase L and PKR. Whether other ISGs may contribute to the restriction of EndoU-deficient coronavirus replication remains to be determined.

All three types of sensors, MDA5, OAS1-3, and PKR, are known to recognize dsRNA, suggesting that the PAMP(s) relevant for their activation during infection is/are of viral origin. Notably, RNase L activation can be triggered by different OAS proteins and may depend on particular cell types and virus infections[35]. For example overexpression of OAS 3 was shown to provide RNase L-dependent activity against dengue virus and chikungunya virus infection [36, 37], while OAS 1 and OAS 3 have been implicated in antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus [38]. It recently has been shown that among the human OAS proteins 1, 2, and 3, OAS 3 seems to be mainly responsible for mediating RNase L activation following either polyI:C transfection or virus infection, suggesting a superior role of human OAS 3 over OAS 1 and OAS 2 in restricting virus replication [33]. Interestingly, structural and biochemical studies revealed that OAS 3 is selective for binding of long dsRNA (>50 bp) by involvement of an RNA-binding, but non-catalytic domain, and that OAS 3 is weakly or not activated by short dsRNA or single-stranded RNA, respectively [39]. Likewise, PKR preferentially dimerizes upon binding to dsRNA of similar length (>60 bp) [40, 41] and Mda5 is actually most efficiently activated by even longer dsRNA (>2 kbp) [42] and higher-order structured RNA containing single-stranded and dsRNA [43]. It is thus tempting to propose that viral dsRNA represents the natural substrate of the coronavirus EndoU. However, it remains to be determined which kind of viral dsRNA is cleaved by the EndoU or triggers Mda5, OAS, and PKR activation. Compared to MHV wild-type infection we observed a slight but reproducible increase of dsRNA in MHVH277A-infected macrophages by FACS analysis during the early phase of the infection (4\u20136 h.p.i.) that became more prominent at 9\u201312 h.p.i., suggesting that the majority of dsRNA is not cleaved by EndoU. This likely includes dsRNA being shielded within double-membrane vesicles and replication intermediates actively involved in viral RNA synthesis that are likely protected by the RTC and the nucleocapsid protein. We therefore speculate that coronaviruses may have evolved a viral RNA quality control mechanism to evade dsRNAs sensing, and that EndoU substrates may comprise dsRNA intermediates within stalled RTCs engaged in genome replication or transcription that are no longer active in viral RNA synthesis.",

However, the recent discovery of insect nidoviruses (family Mesoniviridae) [44, 45] and re-analysis of the ronivirus genome (family Roniviridae; infecting crustaceans) revealed that these two nidovirus families do not encode an EndoU domain [44]. In the light of our results it is tempting to speculate that the EndoU domain has evolved in vertebrate nidoviruses (Corona- and Arteriviridae) to counteract vertebrate-specific innate immune sensing of viral RNA in the context of the type-I interferon system, while the absence of the EndoU domain in roni- and mesoniviruses is indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms of RNA virus innate immune sensing and antiviral effector pathways in invertebrates (e.g. crustaceans and insects) [1].",

            "text": "MHV as a natural mouse pathogen has been instrumental to understand the delicate balance between host IFN-I responses to infection and counteracting mechanisms of coronavirus innate immune evasion. While MHV evades innate immune sensing in most target cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) remain as major IFN-I producer cells during early coronavirus replication to ensure protection of MHV target cells and control of potentially lethal coronavirus infections [46, 47]. While pDCs sense coronaviral RNA within endosomes through TLR7, our data demonstrate that the coronaviral EndoU delays Mda5-mediated cytoplasmic sensing in macrophages and likely other cell types. This enables coronaviruses to establish robust replication and spread at the entry port of infection. However, in the case of highly pathogenic strains or newly emerging zoonotic coronaviruses, delayed IFN-I responses can have detrimental consequences as recently demonstrated in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection [3]. Early and rapid SARS-CoV replication in the respiratory tract combined with a delayed IFN-I response can result in dysregulated innate immune responses and inflammatory cytokine-driven extensive lung damage. Therefore, antiviral intervention aiming at inhibiting the coronavirus EndoU activity may be a promising approach to restore efficient sensing of coronaviral RNA and thereby activating IFN-I expression as well as antiviral effector pathways such as PKR and OAS/RNase L.",

            "text": "There is a growing number of virus-encoded ribonucleases that have been reported to execute diverse steps in the context of cellular mRNA quality control and mRNA decay [48, 49]. For example, herpesvirus-encoded endonucleases are known to broadly target cellular and also viral mRNAs that are subsequently further processed by cellular exonucleases, such as Xrn1, in order to broadly restrict host cell gene expression [50]. While this strategy indirectly impacts host cell innate immune responses, a more specific interaction of RNA decay and host cell dsRNA responses has recently been described for vaccinia virus decapping enzymes D9 and D10 [51, 52]. They remove 5\u2019-cap structures of partially overlapping vaccinia virus mRNAs that arise during the late phase of infection in order to preclude any accumulation of viral dsRNA and subsequent activation of dsRNA sensors such as PKR and OAS. Notably, also in this case Xrn1 is required to further process the de-capped mRNAs. Our data show that early during coronavirus infection the EndoU activity conceptually fulfils the same task, namely the removal of dsRNA that would otherwise trigger host cell dsRNA responses, such as IFN-\u03b2 expression and activation of PKR and OAS/RNase L. It will be interesting to address whether Xrn1 is involved in further degrading the coronavirus EndoU cleavage products or if this function could be fulfilled by the coronavirus-encoded exonuclease (ExoN) activity residing in nsp14. Interestingly, like the EndoU, the coronavirus ExoN is an integral component of the coronaviral RTC, and ExoN has been demonstrated to provide an RNA proofreading function that permits coronaviruses to stably maintain their extraordinary large RNA genome [53\u201355]. A functional link between the two coronaviral ribonucleases, ExoN and EndoU, would suggest an unprecedented concept of viral RNA quality/decay control that goes beyond RNA proofreading and includes the removal of dsRNA-based PAMPs at the site of RNA synthesis to efficiently evade innate and intrinsic antiviral host cell responses.",

It is described by the formula\nY(T)=AG\u2212eMG\u2212TS+PG\u22c5e\u2212(MG\u2212TS)2\nwhere Y is the response value (log virus titer or log expression value), T is the time (in hours), A is the value of the asymptote, M is a \u201emidpoint value\u201drepresenting the time where the exponential increase has reached half of the asymptotic value and where the peak is located, P is a value describing the additional peak height, and S is a scale parameter specifying the steepness of the exponential increase and the width of the peak. The coefficients A, M and P were determined individually for the groups to be compared (MHV-A59 and MHVH277A), as symbolized by the index G. The model was chosen on pragmatic grounds because it was able to describe the time courses of all data very well and the coefficients represent biologically relevant aspects of the kinetics that can be addressed directly by statistical tests. The analyses were performed in R, version 3.2.3 [66] with the function nls [67] using the algorithm \u201cPort\u201d restricting the coefficients to positive values. P-values and confidence intervals were determined by parametric bootstrapping, resampling the residuals from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance estimated from the variance of residuals of the fitted model. Confidence bands were generated by connecting the point-wise 95% confidence intervals of the predictions. The significance of the difference between treatments in differences between maxima of the groups (i.e., the Group-Treatment interaction) was determined by bootstapping the difference-in-difference. The assumption of normally distributed residuals was checked and confirmed with normal-quantile quantile plots.",
