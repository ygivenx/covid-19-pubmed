What these outbreaks have in common is the need for estimation of key parameters early on, in order to plan interventions and monitor the progress of the disease. Thus estimation must be performed in the emerging phase of an outbreak, when the number of infected individuals is in the hundreds or at most thousands, while the community fraction of infected is still small. Typically, the early numbers grow exponentially, as also predicted by mathematical epidemic models [1].",

Despite these complicating factors, the conclusions drawn from early analyses, often based on simple models, are usually highly valuable. The aim of the present paper is to identify and highlight some of the potential biases in the statistical analysis of emerging outbreaks and to illustrate how they can propagate to parameter estimates and predictions. A further aim is to give some fairly simple suggestions for how to reduce, or even remove, such biasing effects.",

The epidemic models used in the statistical analyses are often of simple form, neglecting various heterogeneities. The use of simple models in these situations is motivated by the lack of detailed information but has also recently been studied [2], showing that neglecting population structures when making inference in emerging outbreaks has little effect. However, estimation in simple models can still be quite complicated. The complications are mainly due to three factors: (1) important events, such as times of infection, are usually unobserved, but instead some proxy measures such as onset of symptoms are available, (2) estimation of parameters of the epidemic process is based on observations up to some fixed time, implying that events occurring later are censored and (3) the population of infectives is increasing (exponentially) with time.",

The second problem we study is the effect of replacing generation times (the time between infections of an infector and an infectee) with the more commonly observed serial intervals (the time between onset of symptoms of an infector and an infectee). A third problem we discuss is how to treat the common situation, when contact tracing, of finding more than one potential infector of a case, with the implication that the backward generation time or incubation time (time from infection to symptoms) is one out of several possible values. As it turns out, the potential biasing effects of these problems all go in the same direction and, for example, the basic reproduction number R0 (the average number of infections in a fully susceptible population) can be quite significantly underestimated. We also point out some general stability properties of ratios during exponential growth that may be useful for inference. We then quantify the various biases that can arise in realistic parameter settings, both theoretically and by simulation, mostly using parameters freely adapted from the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa [3].",

We assume that individuals are at first susceptible and later may become infected, and that infected individuals may then infect other individuals. The infection ends with death or recovery. The population is assumed to be a homogeneously mixing community of homogeneous individuals. Since we model the initial phase of the outbreak, the depletion of susceptibles is considered as negligible. Also, we assume that individuals do not change their behaviour over the considered time period as a consequence of the ongoing outbreak, nor are there yet any control measures put in place by health authorities or similar. Finally, we assume that there are no seasonal changes in transmission. Predictions are made assuming that the disease spreading mechanism continues unaltered, reflecting what would presumably happen in the absence of control measures (these predictions should then be compared with predictions including various preventive measures).",

Recently, modelling has reverted to something akin to the original Kermack & McKendrick [5] formulation, with emphasis on one single quantity, \u03b2(s), the average rate at which an infected individual infects new individuals s time units after his/her time of infection, denoted the infection rate or infectivity function. The assumption of a homogeneous community implies that \u03b2(s) is the same for all individuals, and the assumptions of no depletion of susceptibles, no preventive measures and no seasonal effects imply that \u03b2(s) is independent of the time of infection of the individual. The previously mentioned compartmental models can all be translated to this framework. While the original treatment of the Kermack\u2013McKendrick model was deterministic (Volterra-type integral equations), statistical modelling requires a stochastic formulation which, in this case, corresponds to a Crump\u2013Mode\u2013Jagers branching process [6] in the initial phase of spread. It should be noted that the infectivity functions in a stochastic model may be different from individual to individual, although the average behaviour is the same, and that different stochastic models may have the same average behaviour [7].",

This seemingly innocent choice of looking backwards rather than forwards in time (measuring duration backwards from an infectee rather than forwards from an infector) actually modifies the distribution of observed times in the early stage of an outbreak when the epidemic grows at an exponential rate (e.g. [17\u201319]). The reason is that, by looking backwards in time, long generation times will be underrepresented and short generation times will be overrepresented because exponential growth implies that there are many more recently infected individuals who are potential infectors compared to those infected longer ago. As a consequence, if the generation time distribution is estimated from a sample of backward generation times, the resulting distribution fB(s) will be different from the true generation time distribution fG(s).",

Individuals having only one exposure and then symptoms must have been infected at this exposure and thus their infection history is certain.

In fact, the observed time interval will be distributed as the minimum of a typical \u2018inter-exposure time\u2019 and a generic incubation time, and will thus have a distribution different from a generic incubation time, leading to underestimation.

However, during the exponentially increasing phase of spread, a well-known result from branching process theory (a special case of \u2018counting by random characteristics\u2019; e.g. [28]), implies that ratios between counts within a specific time window can be predicted.",

For the recent Ebola epidemic, it is found [3] that the incubation period distribution fD, assumed to be equal to that of the latent period, is Gamma distributed with mean 11.4 days and s.d. = 8.1 days and that generation times are Gamma distributed with mean 15.3 days and s.d. = 9.3 days. It is also reported that approximately 25% of the contact traced individuals had one unique infector and 75% had more than one potential infector. We will use the above parameter values for this example. With the complete data, it would have been possible to estimate the contact rate \u03bb and the probability p to get infected by a close Ebola contact separately. Here we can only use that 25% had a single contact. We simply assume that p = 0.5 and equate P(a single contact)=p\u222b0\u221ee\u2212\u03bbsfD(s) ds to the empirical value 0.25. The result is that \u03bb = 0.0725 per day (so about one close contact every two weeks for the contact-traced individuals). Once values for p and \u03bb are available, one can compute the mean incubation period for observations having only one possible infector:E(D |one possible infector)=\u222b0\u221espfD(s) e\u2212\u03bbs ds/P(one possible infector)\u22488.1.Thus, the mean incubation period for infectees with only one potential infector will be 11.4 \u2212 8.1 = 3.3 days shorter than the mean incubation period had all observations been used. This in turn implies that the mean generation time from the same data would be underestimated by 3.3 days, giving a mean of 12 instead of 15.3 days. Assuming that the standard deviation remains unchanged (= 9.3 days), the estimated generation time distribution would be Gamma distributed with mean 12 and s.d. = 9.3 days. Using this generation time distribution, instead of the true one, in equation (2.4), assuming r = 0.0383 to be known (e.g. estimated from the observed growth rate), leads to R0single = 1.50, an underestimation of 12%. Conversely, assuming R0 = 1.7, the exponential growth rate estimated from the contact traced individuals having only a single unique infector would approximately equal rsingle = 0.0522, which overestimates the true value by 36%.",

If the incubation period has a distribution differing from the assumed (gamma) model distribution (the log-normal distribution, in our simulation), the moment-estimators still perform well, but the maximum-likelihood estimates of mean and variance derived under the assumption of gamma distributed incubation times now acquire some bias.

Importantly, all three sources lead to biases in the same direction, causing the basic reproduction number R0 to be underestimated if the epidemic growth rate r is correctly estimated.

To evaluate the combined biasing effect in this setting is a complicated exercise, depending on exactly how estimation is performed and presented but, assuming independence (i.e. multiplicative action), the total effect could be as large as, for example, 23% underestimation of R0 (assuming a 50% increase in the coefficient of variation of the serial interval). In other settings, the effects could be quite different. In the main sections and in the corresponding sections of the electronic supplementary material, general formulae, if possible, or at least formulae under assumptions of Gamma distributions, if results depend on assumed distributions, are available and applicable in other parameter settings. It should be noted that even moderate errors in R0, especially if the true value is not very large, can have large consequences. As numerical illustration, assume that the true value of R0 is 1.7, but that the estimate is negatively biased by 10% or even 23%, depending on how estimation is performed. Then the biased estimate would be around 1.53 or 1.31, respectively. Such a difference can have quite large consequences when planning control measures. For instance, the critical immunization level (both for vaccination and any other measure aimed at reducing infection) is usually calculated as vc = 1 \u2212 1/R0. For the true R0, this results in vc=41%, while the lower biased estimates yield v^c=35% or 24%, respectively.

Social structures have been shown to have limited effects for estimation in emerging epidemics [2], but spatial effects [32] clearly play a role in disease spread, and their effect on parameter estimates is yet to be investigated.

The red circles indicate end of latent period and start of infectious period, the black circles indicate onset of symptoms, and black boxes end of infectious period (either by death or recovery). In the figure, the infectious period starts slightly before onset of symptoms, but, in general, the relationship between these event times is disease-dependent. In the illustration, the serial interval is shorter than the generation time, S < G, but the opposite relation could equally well happen. (Online version in colour.)",
