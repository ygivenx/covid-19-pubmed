            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases form a significant threat to the human population. The natural history of viruses in animal reservoirs and their ability to infect the human host is important to predict the risk of spillover events and subsequent epidemics. The World Health Organization has identified a list of top emerging diseases likely to cause major epidemics. The list includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused a pandemic in 2002\u20132003 [1]. SARS-CoV is hypothesized to originate from Rhinolophus sinicus bats since several SARS-like viruses have been detected in this host [2,3]. However, most SARS-like viruses from bats do not bind the human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). For example, a recombinant virus based on a consensus sequence of SARS-like viruses from bats could not be cultured unless a part of the spike protein was exchanged with SARS-CoV spike protein [4]. This suggests that a substantial portion of the SARS-like viruses circulating in bats cannot infect humans directly.",

            "text": "In 2013, Ge et al. isolated a SARS-like virus from the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus): WIV1-CoV [5], which can use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV, in vitro and transgenic mice [6]. This suggests WIV1-CoV may be able to directly transmit from bats to humans. In order to understand the relationship between coronaviruses and their bat hosts, experimental animal models are needed. Unfortunately, most bat species are difficult to obtain for laboratory experiments and most of these species have poorly annotated genomes. These limitations have posed a challenge in the field and explain a current deficit in the literature. In 2010, one group inoculated Leschenault\u2019s rousette bats (Rousettus leschenaultia) with a homogenate of Betacoronavirus (clade b)-positive intestinal tissues obtained from a lesser short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis). No clinical signs were observed, but viral RNA was detected in both fecal samples and intestinal tissue [7]. Likewise, no clinical signs were observed following intranasal and intraperitoneal inoculation of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. However, shedding of viral RNA was detected in oral and rectal swabs, and a variety of different tissues tested positive for viral RNA [8]. Together, these studies suggest that bats might show limited clinical signs when infected with coronaviruses but will continue to shed the virus.",

All three coronavirus spike proteins incorporated into VSV reporter particles (Figure 1B). While MERS-CoV spike could only mediate entry into cells expressing DPP4, both SARS-CoV and WIV1 spikes mediated entry into cells expressing human and Egyptian fruit bat ACE2 (Figure 1C). Furthermore, transfection of BHK cells with either human or Egyptian fruit bat ACE2 and subsequent infection with WIV1-CoV resulted in virus replication as measured in supernatant at 48 h post infection (hpi), whereas no virus replication could be found in BHK cells not transfected with ACE2 (Figure 1D). Taken together, these data show that WIV1 spike can effectively utilize ACE2 from Egyptian fruit bats for entry and infection.",

            "text": "In the present study, we investigated whether Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are susceptible to infection by SARS-like WIV1-CoV, originally detected in Chinese rufous horseshoe bats. The first step in host susceptibility to coronaviruses is associated with the ability to bind to host-specific receptors and the availability of these receptors on target organs. SARS-CoV S1 binds less efficiently to murine ACE2 than human ACE2, and thus wildtype mice are a suboptimal SARS-CoV animal model [10]. Upon expression of Egyptian fruit bat ACE2 on non-susceptible BHK cells, WIV1-CoV was able to enter and replicate, demonstrating that ACE2 from Egyptian fruit bats is a suitable receptor. However, while ACE2 was expressed in bat intestine and respiratory tract tissue, similar to humans [11], we observed very limited evidence of virus replication and seroconversion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that WIV1-CoV restriction in the Egyptian fruit bat was not at the receptor level. However, in this study very limited evidence of virus replication or seroconversion was detected. It is currently unclear why WIV1-CoV seems unable to replicate efficiently in Egyptian fruit bats. It is possible that the WIV1-CoV S glycoprotein is not processed by surface or intracellular proteases, which have been shown to be important host restriction factors during coronavirus entry [12,13]. Furthermore, a specific host factor may be required for virus transcription and replication, which could be lacking in the Egyptian fruit bats [14]. A recent study generated an annotated full genome for Egyptian fruit bats and used this to show greatly expanded natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes and type I interferons. It has been hypothesized that these factors allow greater tolerance to viral infection [15], resulting in prolonged infection but limited inflammation which has been described for Egyptian fruit bats inoculated with Marburg virus [16,17]. However, as we found very limited evidence of viral RNA, it is more likely that either an enhanced antiviral response or an inability of WIV1-CoV to dampen the innate response abrogated viral replication completely. Interestingly, some of the sera collected from bats before challenge contained antibodies which cross-reacted against full-length SARS-CoV spike protein as well as nucleoprotein. As most bats were negative for SARS-specific antibodies, we were unable to detect neutralizing antibodies. This does not directly explain why we did not see extensive viral replication. A small increase in the presence of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies was observed in 2 out of 12 bats; bat #6 showed an increase in N-specific antibodies, bat #11 showed an increase in S-specific antibodies. These findings suggest that some low-level virus replication might have occurred in these bats, resulting in an adaptive immune response.",
