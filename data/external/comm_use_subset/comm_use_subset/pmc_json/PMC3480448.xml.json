TBEV, a tick-borne flavivirus (TBFV), is responsible for 14,000 infections per year [1] and has a fatality rate of up to 40% [2]. Symptoms of TBEV infection can include fever, malaise, meningitis, and encephalitis. TBEV and other TBFV, such as Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever virus, are classified as NIAID Category C pathogens and are treated as biosafety level 4 agents in the United States. One TBFV, Langat virus (LGTV), is naturally attenuated [3], [4], making it suitable for biosafety level 2 work and ideal for use in laboratory studies as a model for higher pathogenicity viruses.",

Historically, Ixodidae ticks (hard ticks) have been considered to be the arthropod vector, but, some findings with Alkhurma virus [5] and Kyasanur Forest virus [6] suggest that the soft-bodied Ornithodoros ticks can transmit TBFV. Thus, the arthropod host-range for TBFV may be greater than assumed. The TBFV present a unique situation because the viruses persistently infect ticks and are maintained by vertical transmission across the developmental instars (larval, nymph, and adult). Horizontal transmission (from tick to vertebrate host) then allows amplification of the frequency of the virus within the tick population, as uninfected ticks feeding upon infected vertebrates can acquire the virus [7], [8]. The primary vertebrate hosts are generally small rodents; however, infection of larger mammals also occurs in endemic areas. Humans are an inadvertent, dead-end host, contracting TBFV via tick bite or less frequently by consumption of milk from infected animals [1]. The impact of TBFV infection on vertebrates can vary considerably; some reports describe persistent infection of vertebrates and vertebrate cell lines [9]\u2013[11] while other laboratory studies show severe disease development in infected animals [12]\u2013[14].",

            "text": "Like other members of the family Flaviviridae, LGTV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. Upon infecting a cell, the virions are thought to traffic to the endosome, where they undergo structural transformation and fuse with host cell membranes, releasing the 11-kb viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm [15]. The genomic RNA, which can function as mRNA, is translated into an approximately 400 kDa polyprotein [16] that is subsequently cleaved into at least ten proteins by both viral and cellular host proteases [17]. The currently defined complement consists of three structural proteins (Capsid [C], membrane [M], and envelope [E]) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [17], [18]. Precise functions for all of the nonstructural proteins are not fully elucidated, but some roles have been determined. NS1 can be found on the cell surface but is known to be secreted [17] and is also detected in perinuclear areas where it is believed to play a part in viral replication [19]; however, its role has not yet been clearly defined. NS3 is a RNA helicase and also acts as a viral protease using NS2B as a co-factor [20], [21]. NS4A, a small hydrophobic protein, has been implicated in the cellular changes that accompany virus reproduction [22] and has been shown to localize to foci within the perinuclear region of infected cells [23]. NS5 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase [17]; however, recent implications of LGTV NS5 as an innate immune response antagonist confirms a broader role for this protein beyond genome replication [24]. This broader role is also seen in NS5\u2032s wider distribution, being located in cell nuclei, perinuclear regions, and diffusely throughout the cytoplasm [25]. Following synthesis of the viral proteins, the single stranded genome is converted into a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which serves as a transcriptional template as well as the viral replicative form. Together with the replication complex, made up of NS1, NS2A, NS3, NS4A, and NS5, dsRNA is found in cytoplasmic, perinuclear foci throughout LGTV infected cells. This dsRNA species is an additional obligatory replicative intermediate.",

The findings, generally, show agreement between mammalian and arthropod cells in virus induced structures, such as cytoplasmic membrane proliferation and vesicle formation. Some changes were noted via TEM by Senigl et al. [35] four to seven days post TBEV infection; viral particles were observed inside rough ER in mammalian cells but were visualized within vacuoles or within the cytosol in tick cells. Consequently, we have undertaken a direct comparison of LGTV infection in both mammalian and arthropod cells, and extended the results to include 3D reconstructions. In addition, we have shown for the first time the 3D structure of acute and persistent flavivirus infection in an arthropod cell line.",

Therefore, to further demonstrate that LGTV replication was occurring in an ER derived compartment [44], we co-stained infected Vero and ISE6 cells for dsRNA and either viral proteins or cellular markers. Uninfected cells showed no dsRNA staining (Fig. 5A). In infected Vero cells, labeling for dsRNA was largely confined to areas staining for NS3 (Fig. 5B) and NS5 (Fig. 5C). The same general pattern was seen in acutely (Fig. 5B and 5C) and persistently (data not shown) infected ISE6 cells, but the dsRNA signal was not as prominent as in the Vero cells. The majority of dsRNA labeling was coincident with ER staining (Fig. 6), but not with Golgi staining (data not shown) in acutely infected Vero or in ISE6 cells, both acutely and persistently infected. Taken together, these findings indicated that in both mammalian and tick cells, LGTV replication, as defined by the presence of dsRNA, viral helicase, and viral polymerase, was occurring in areas of ER proliferation.",

Similar to other positive strand viruses, such as Semliki Forest virus [54], rubella virus [52], and poliovirus [51], the flaviviruses induce remarkable alterations in the cytoplasmic membrane system. In our study, Vero cells acutely infected with LGTV show the ER proliferation, vesicle accumulation, and membrane network (Fig. 7B\u2013D) described in earlier studies with mosquito-borne flaviviruses [30], [31]. A number of functions have been ascribed to the alterations, including concentration of viral replication machinery, provision of a solid state platform for viral protein synthesis and replication, and sequestration of viral dsRNA replicative form from innate immune sensors [27], [55], [56]. In general, viral protein distribution in acutely infected tick cells was similar; however, some differences were apparent. Vero cells had higher levels of ER proliferation and rearrangement as well as significantly more viral particles. This may have been the result of the greater level of replication seen in Vero cells but, it is also possible that the differences are the result of a fundamental difference between the two host cell lines.",

By ET, the proliferating membranes are revealed to be a complex anastomosing system of membranes almost certainly derived from ER. In the Semliki Forest virus replicon system containing Kunjin virus proteins, expression of a single flavivirus protein, NS4A, can induce the membrane rearrangements [22], and similar results have been reported for Dengue virus NS4A [57], but it is uncertain at this time if this role can be assigned to NS4A in the TBFV.

The persistently infected tick cells had greater changes in ER structure and ER abundance (Fig. 7B\u2013D) than the acutely infected cells, although viral titers (Fig. 1B & C) were similar in both settings. However, the most remarkable difference between acute and persistent infection was the number of tubular structures. These structures have been noted infrequently in infected cells [26], [30], [34], and their relevance in flavivirus replication is uncertain. In our acute mammalian and tick cell experiments, we confirmed these observations and saw tubules only occasionally (Fig. 7D, 8, and Movies S1, S2, and S3). However, in the persistently infected tick cells, the number of tubules increased dramatically (Fig. 7D, 8C, & Movie S3). While the diameter was similar to that seen in round vesicles (60\u2013100 nm), the length was up to eight times as long. The tubules were often arranged in membrane-bound, fascicle-like bundles (Fig. 8C and Movie S3). The 3D reconstructions demonstrated that the tubules were closed on each end and, although closely juxtaposed, were not connected by pores to other tubules or to the cytoplasm, unlike the round vesicles. The function of the tubules is obscure at this time, and it is unclear if they represent bona fide features of replication, aberrant structures, or the result of a cellular process to restrict infection. It is possible the tubules may play a role in initiation or maintenance of the persistent infections or if the apparent lack of pores in the tubules is consequential. It may be that the increase in the number of tubules is the result of the higher number of defective virus particles, which are known to exist in persistently infected cells [60]\u2013[62]. Tubules may be formed as a result of a failure to correctly gather the membrane to form the round vesicles and pores that are associated with the flavivirus replication complex. Perhaps the lack of pores prevents proper replication or packaging of the viral genome. Additional cell biology or biochemistry studies may shed light on the role of the tubules.",
