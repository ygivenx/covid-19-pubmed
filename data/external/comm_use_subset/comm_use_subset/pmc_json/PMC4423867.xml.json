            "text": "T cells play crucial roles in tumor surveillance and protection against invading pathogens. However, if not properly regulated, T cells can attack normal healthy cells of the body. This defective response may lead to tissue destruction and devastating autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Treatments to modify the progression of autoimmune diseases often include immunosuppressant medications that lead to enhanced susceptibility to infections and tumors. Inhibition of Drak2, a serine-threonine kinase, may be an alternative approach to inhibit autoreactive T cells without acting as an immunosuppressant.",

In both of these disease models, the accumulation of autoreactive T cells in the target organ is significantly reduced in the absence of Drak2. The reduced accumulation of autoreactive T cells is due to an increased susceptibility to death of the Drak2\n-/- T cells [2,3]. Interestingly, despite this increased sensitivity to death in the T cells, the Drak2\n-/- mice effectively eliminate infectious pathogens and retain the ability to combat tumors as well as wildtype mice [2,4\u20137]. Thus, Drak2 is an ideal protein to target in order to treat autoimmune disorders without compromising immunity to pathogens and tumors. However, the substrates and downstream effects of Drak2 signaling that contribute to autoimmunity require further elucidation to validate its potential as a therapeutic target and to further understand how these autoimmune diseases develop.",

TGF-\u03b2 is a pleiotropic cytokine that elicits numerous effects on various cell types [13]. In T cells specifically, TGF-\u03b2 inhibits proliferation of na\u00efve T cells, induces development of regulatory T cells, and enhances apoptosis of activated T cells. A recent study proposed that Drak2 functions as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation and recruitment of Smad2 and Smad3 to the TGF-\u03b2RI in cell lines [12]. Thus, the absence of Drak2 in T cells may render these cells more susceptible to TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which could prevent autoimmunity. However, it has not been tested if Drak2 functions as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 in T cells, and consequently, whether Drak2\n-/- T cells are more sensitive to TGF-\u03b2 signaling.",

We found that TGF-\u03b2 signaling via Smad2 and Smad3 was not enhanced in the absence of Drak2 in T cells, and that Drak2\n-/- T cells did not exhibit enhanced responses to TGF-\u03b2 signaling during in vitro assays. These data suggest that Drak2 does not function as an inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in T cells. Moreover, in the absence of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, Drak2\n-/- T cells remained more susceptible to apoptosis, suggesting that the increase in cell death observed in vitro, was not due to enhanced TGF-\u03b2-mediated signals. These data provide insight into the role of Drak2 in autoimmune diseases by showing that Drak2 may not suppress TGF-\u03b2 signaling in T cells, and therefore may contribute to autoimmune disease via other molecular pathways.",

TGF-\u03b2 receptor engagement results in the phosphorylation of the Smad2/Smad3 signaling complex, which then translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to facilitate TGF-\u03b2-mediated transcription. To determine if Smad2 translocation into the nucleus was increased in the absence of Drak2, we activated CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 24 hours, and then utilized confocal fluorescent microscopy to analyze Smad2 localization following addition of TGF-\u03b2. As expected, Smad2 translocation into the nucleus was not observed in stimulated T cells without exogenous TGF-\u03b2 (Fig 1). The addition of TGF-\u03b2 during the final 20 minutes of culture elicited Smad2 translocation into the nuclear region of both wildtype and Drak2\n-/- T cells (Fig 1). Importantly, there were no differences in Smad2 translocation between wildtype and Drak2\n-/- T cells in response to exogenous TGF-\u03b2.",

Although we did not observe enhanced TGF-\u03b2 signaling in Drak2\n-/- T cells via Smad proteins, it was possible that Drak2 regulated the pathway through alternative mechanisms. Therefore, we explored the effects of TGF-\u03b2 on several T cell functions in vitro. TGF-\u03b2 suppresses T cell receptor-induced proliferation of na\u00efve T cells in vitro [14]. Thus, we examined if na\u00efve Drak2\n-/- T cells were more sensitive to TGF-\u03b2-mediated inhibition of proliferation than naive wildtype T cells. Na\u00efve OT-II and OT-II.Drak2\n-/- CD4+ T cells were stimulated with OVA323-pulsed splenocytes in the presence or absence of TGF-\u03b2, and analyzed for proliferation. The number of live, divided CD4+ T cells decreased in response to TGF-\u03b2 (Fig 3a). However, the effect of TGF-\u03b2 inhibition was comparable between OT-II and OT-II.Drak2\n-/- T cells. We also tested the effect of TGF-\u03b2 on proliferation of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells, by stimulating OT-I and OT-I.Drak2\n-/- T cells with OVA257-pulsed splenocytes in the presence of TGF-\u03b2. Similar to CD4+ T cells, the number of live, divided CD8+ T cells decreased in response to TGF-\u03b2, and the amount of suppression was similar between OT-I and OT-I.Drak2\n-/- T cells (Fig 3b), again suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 signaling was not enhanced in the absence of Drak2.",

OT-I and OT-I.Drak2\n-/- cells were stimulated with OVA257-pulsed splenocytes for two days.

Adding IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 enhanced the recovery of live CD8+ T cells compared to culture in media alone. The addition of TGF-\u03b2 masked the increased recovery in response to IL-15, but not IL-2 and IL-7. Decreased cell recovery in response to TGF-\u03b2 compared to culture in media alone correlated with an increase in the proportion of Annexin V+ apoptotic cells (Fig 4b).

In addition, we found that following in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, a greater proportion of Drak2\n-/- T cells were apoptotic compared to wildtype T cells (Fig 6a and 6b, left portion of graph). Although we did not observe differences in TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the absence of Drak2, there may be alternative TGF-\u03b2-mediated effects on T cell survival. Thus, we sought to determine if the survival defect in Drak2\n-/- T cells compared to wildtype T cells was due to enhanced TGF-\u03b2 signaling. To test this, we compared T cell survival between wildtype and Drak2\n-/- T cells that exhibit impaired TGF-\u03b2 signaling due to expression of a dominant-negative TGF-\u03b2 receptor II (DNRII) transgene. The DNRII transgene is a kinase-dead mutant that blocks signaling through the endogenous TGF-\u03b2 receptor by competing for TGF-\u03b2 binding [17]. Na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were sorted from wildtype, Drak2\n-/-, DNRII, and DNRII.Drak2\n-/- mice. The purified T cells were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We found that even with the severe reduction in TGF-\u03b2 signaling, there was an increase in the proportion of nonviable DNRII.Drak2\n-/- CD4+ (Fig 6a, right portion of graph) and CD8+ (Fig 6b, right portion of graph) T cells compared to DNRII CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These data show that the enhanced death in the Drak2\n-/- T cells following in vitro stimulation is not due to increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and suggest that alternative signaling pathways play a role.",

Thus, as reported in certain tumors, Drak2 may function to negatively regulate TGF-\u03b2 signaling and promote tumorigenesis [12]. However, this is contrary to other reports that describe Drak2 as a tumor suppressor [18\u201320]. Therefore, the role of Drak2 in different types of tumors is also controversial and needs to be studied further. Interestingly, we have shown that Drak2\n-/- mice respond similarly to wildtype mice in various in vivo tumor models, again suggesting that the role of Drak2 in cell lines may not mimic its role under physiological conditions [7].",
