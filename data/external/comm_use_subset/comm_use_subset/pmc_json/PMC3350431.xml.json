In this paper, we conduct a review of the PI mitigation models available in the published research literature with an objective of answering the question: \"how to enhance the pandemic simulation models and the associated databases for operational use at provincial and local levels?\" We believe that our review accomplishes its objective in two steps. First, it exposes the differences between the perspectives of the public health practitioners and the developers of models and databases on the required model capabilities. Second, it derives recommendations for enhancing practical usability of the PI models and the associated databases.",

In the United States and other few countries, availability of temporally consistent demographical data is currently supported by governmental databases including the decennial census and the national household travel survey [7-10]. To ensure temporal consistency of epidemiological data, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recommended enhancing the data collection protocols to support real-time decision making [4]. The frequency of data updating may vary based on the decision objective of the model (e.g., outbreak detection, outbreak surveillance, and initiation and scope of interventions). As noted by Fay-Wolfe, the timeliness of a decision is as important as its correctness [11], and there should be a balance between the cost of data updating and the marginal benefits of the model driven decisions.",

Some of the existing models feature highly granular description of disease spread dynamics and mitigation via consideration of scenarios involving millions of individuals and refined time scales. While such details might increase credibility and validity of the models, this can also result in a substantial computational burden, sometimes, beyond the capabilities of personal computers.",

For example, differential equation (DE) models divide population members into compartments, where in each compartment every member makes the same number of contacts (homogeneous mixing) and a contact can be any member in the compartment (perfect mixing). In contrast, agent-based (AB) models track each individual of the population where an individual contacts only the members in his/her relationship network (e.g., neighbors, co-workers, household members, etc.) [16]. The refined traceability of individual members offered by AB models increases the usage of computational resources. Further increases in the computational needs are brought on by the need for running multiple replicates of the models and generating reliable output summaries.",

These studies suggest that the migratory patterns of the virus, rather than the intrinsic genomic features, are responsible for the second pandemic wave in 2009 [50,51]. Since R and IAR are affected not only by the genomic features but also by the migratory patterns of the virus, a close monitoring of these parameters throughout the pandemic spread is essential. Real-time monitoring of parameters describing disease natural history and fraction of asymptomatic cases is generally not necessary since they are mostly dependent on the intrinsic genomic features of the virus. These parameters can be estimated when a viral evolution is confirmed through laboratory surveillance. Estimation methods may include surveys (e.g., household surveys of members of index cases [52,53]) and laboratory experiments that inoculate pandemic strains into human volunteers [54].",

There exist several estimators for R (Wallinga et al. [55,56], Fraser [57], White and Pagano [58], Bettencourt et al. [59], and Cauchemez et al. [60]). These estimates have been derived from different underlying infection transmission models (e.g., differential equations, time since infection and directed network). With different underlying transmission models, the estimators consider data from different perspectives, thereby yield different values for R at a certain time t. For example, Fraser [57] proposes an instantaneous R that observes how past case incidence data (e.g., in time points t-1, t-2, t-3) contribute to the present incidence at time t. In contrast, Wallinga et al. [55,56] and Cauchemez et al. [60] propose estimators that observe how the future incidences (e.g., t + 1, t + 2, t + 3) are contributed by a case at time t. White and Pagano [58] considers an estimator that can be called a running estimate of the instantaneous reproduction number.",

At provincial and local levels, surveillance systems are passive as they mostly collect data from infected cases who are seeking healthcare [64]. With passive surveillance, only a fraction of symptomatic cases are detected with a probable time delay from the onset of symptoms. Once the symptomatic cases seek healthcare and are reported to the surveillance system, the healthcare providers selectively submit specimens to the public health laboratories (PHL) for confirmatory testing. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, in regions with high incidence rates, the daily testing capacities of the PHL were far exceeded by the number of specimens received. In these PHL, the existing first-come-first-serve testing policy and the manual methods for receiving and processing the specimens further delayed the pace of publication of confirmed cases. The time series of the laboratory confirmed cases likely have been higher due to the increased specimen submission resulting from the behavioral response (fear) of both the susceptible population and the healthcare providers after the pandemic declaration [65]. Similarly, time series of the confirmed cases likely have been lower at the later stages of the pandemic as federal agencies advocated to refrain from specimen submission [66].",

In our opinion, the above enhancement can be achieved by developing methods for statistical sampling and testing of specimens in the PHL. In addition, new scheduling protocols will have to be developed for testing the specimens, given the limited laboratory testing resources, in order to better assess the epidemiological parameters of an outbreak. With better sampling and scheduling schemes at the PHL, alterations in the specimen submission policies during a pandemic (as experienced in the U.S. during the 2009 outbreak) may not be necessary. The above enhancements would also support a better real-time assessment of the IAR, which is also derived from case incidence data.",

There exist recent mechanisms to estimate incidence curves in real-time by using web-based questionnaires from symptomatic volunteers [67], Google and Yahoo search queries [68,69] and Tweeter messages [70] and have supported influenza preparedness in several European countries and the U.S. [67,69].

Estimation of these parameters has traditionally relied on comprehensive public databases, including the U.S. Census, Landscan, Italian Institute of Statistics, Census of Canada, Hong Kong survey data, UK National Statistics, National Household Travel Survey, UK department of transport, U.S. National Centre for Educational Statistics, the Italian Ministry of University and Research and the UK Department for Education and Skills.

It is worth noting that access to demographic information is currently limited in many countries, and therefore obtaining demographic parameters in real-time would only be possible for where information holders (censing agencies and governmental institutions) openly share the data.",

This coupling is essential since the possibility of new infection arrivals may accelerate the occurrence of the pandemic peak [17]. This information on peak occurrence could significantly influence time of interventions. Some of the single region models consider a closed community with infusion of a small set of infected cases at the beginning [24,26,34]. Single region models also consider a pseudo global coupling through a constant introduction of cases per unit time [15,29]. Other single region models adopt a more detailed approach, where, for each time unit, the number of imported infections is estimated by the product of the new arrivals to the region and the probability of an import being infected. This infection probability is estimated through a global disease spread compartmental model [14,30]. The latter approach is similar to the one used by Merler [17] for seeding infections worldwide and is operationally viable due to its computational simplicity. For a more comprehensive approach to case importation and global modeling of disease spread, see [71].",

For household, the Imperial-Pitt model assumes constant contact probability while the UW-LANL model assumes that the probability varies with age (e.g., kid to kid, kid to adult). The assumption of contact probability varying with age matches reality better than assuming it to be constant [72]. However, for households with smaller living areas the variations may not be significant. Also, neither of the papers aimed at examining strategies (e.g., isolation of sick children within a house) that depended on age-based contact probability. Hence, we believe that the assumptions can be considered credible and valid. For workplaces and schools, the assumption of 75% of contacts within the group and 25% contacts outside the group, as made in the Imperial-Pitt model, appears closer to reality than the assumption of constant probability in the UW-LANL model [72]. For community places, the Imperial-Pitt model considered proximity as a factor influencing the contact probability, which was required for implementing the strategy of providing antiviral prophylaxis to individuals within a ring of certain radius around each detected case.",

The frequency of update dictates how often the infection status of the contacted individuals is evaluated. In reality, infection transmission may occur (or does not occur) whenever there is a contact event between a susceptible and an infected subject. The Imperial-Pitt and the UW-LANL models do not evaluate infection status after each contact event, since this would require consideration of refined daily schedules to determine the times of the contact events. Instead, the models evaluate infection status every six hours [14] or at the end of the day [15] by aggregating the contact events. While such simplified assumptions do not allow the determination of the exact time of infection for each susceptible, they offer a significant computational reduction. Moreover, in a real-life situation, it will be nearly impossible to determine the exact time of each infection, and hence practical mitigation (or surveillance) strategies should not rely on it.",

Furthermore, the issue of credibility and validity of the model assumptions should be viewed from the perspectives of the decision needs and the balance between analytical tractability and computational complexity. For example, it is unlikely that any mitigation strategy would have an element that depends of the minute by minute changes in the disease status. Hence, it might be unnecessary to consider a time scale of the order of a minute for a model and thus increase both computational and data needs.",

[43], the values of the contact rates were assumed due to the unavailability of reliable data required to describe the mobility and connectivity of modern human networks [24,37,38]. However, it is now possible to find \"fresh\" estimates of the types, frequency, and duration of human contacts either from a recent survey at the continental level [72] or from a model that derives synthetic contact information at the country level [73]. In addition, recent advances in data collection through Bluetooth enabled mobile telephones [74] and radio frequency identification (RFID) devices [75] allow better extraction of proximity patterns and social relationships. Availability of these data creates further opportunity to explore methods of access, retrieval, and translation into model parameters. Issues of data confidentiality, cost of the sensing devices, and low compliance to the activation of sensing applications might prevent the Bluetooth and RFID technologies from being effectively used in evolving pandemic outbreaks. Another possibility is the use of aggregated and anonymous network bandwidth consumption data (from network service providers) to extrapolate population distribution in different areas at different points in time [76,77].",

Ciofi is an open source model that is coupled with a differential equation model to allow for a more realistic importation of cases to a region. FluTE is an open source model, which is an updated version of the UW-LANL [34] agent-based model. The source code for FluTE is also available as a parallelized version that supports simulation of large populations on multiple processors. Among these three softwares, Influsim has a GUI, whereas Ciofi and UW-LANL are provided as a C/C++ code. Influsim's GUI seems to be more user friendly for healthcare policymakers. FluTE and Ciofi, on the other hand, offer more options for mitigation strategies, but requires the knowledge of C/C++ programming language and the communication protocols for parallelization. Other C++ models are planning to become, or are already, publicly accessible, according to the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) survey [86]. We note that the policy makers would greatly benefit if softwares like FluTE or Ciofi can be made available through a cyber-enabled computing infrastructure, such as TeraGrid [87]. This will provide the policy makers access to the program through a web based GUI without having to cope with the issues of software parallelization and equipment availability. Moreover, the policy makers will not require the skills of programming, modeling, and data integration.",

The questions are as follows. Is the data support adequate and valid? How credible and valid are the model assumptions? Is human behavior represented appropriately in these models? How accessible and scalable are these models? This review paper attempts to determine to what extent the current literature addresses the above questions at provincial and local levels, and what the areas of possible enhancements are. The findings with regards to the areas of enhancements are summarized below.",

As regards the epidemiological parameters, we have noted the need to obtain prompt and reliable estimates for the IAR and R, which we believe can be obtained by enhancing protocols for expedited and representative specimen collection and testing. During a pandemic, the estimates for IAR and R should also be obtained as often as possible to update simulation models. For the disease natural history and the fraction of asymptomatic cases, estimation should occur every time viral evolution is confirmed by the public health laboratories. For periodic updating of the simulation models, there is a need to develop interfaces for (semi)automatic data access and retrieval. Algorithms for translating data into model parameters should not delay model execution and decision making. Demographic data are generally available. But most of the models that we examined are not capable of performing (semi)automatic access, retrieval, and translation of demographic data into model parameter values.",

Some mitigation strategies require more realistic model assumptions (e.g., location based antiviral prophylaxis would require models that track geographic coordinates of individuals so that those within a radius of an infected individual can be identified). Whereas other mitigation strategies might be well supported by coarser models (e.g.,\"antiviral prophylaxis for household members\") would require models that track household membership). Therefore, whenever validity of the modeling assumptions is examined, the criteria chosen for the examination should depend on the decisions supported by the model.",

Although some of the examined models attempt to capture social-behavioral issues, it appears that they lack adequate consideration of many other factors (e.g., voluntary vaccination, voluntary avoidance to travel to affected regions). Hence, there is a need for research studies or expert opinion analysis to identify which social-behavioral factors are significant for disease spread. It is also essential to determine how the social behavioral data should be collected (in real-time or through surveys), archived for easy access, retrieved, and translated into model parameters. In addition, operational models for pandemic spread and mitigation should reflect the state of the art in data for the contact parameters and integrate recent methodologies for collection of human mobility data.",

We have also discussed the question whether the public health decision makers should be burdened with the task of downloading and running models using local computers (laptops). This task can be far more complex than how it is perceived by the public health decision makers.
