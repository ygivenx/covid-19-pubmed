Hand washing, psychological stress, social support, and shift work may modify the risk of viral respiratory infection [8\u201311]. However, data on the preventive role of physical interventions, e.g. hand washing, in adult populations are rather weak and the results are conflicting [12]. The role of physical activity is uncertain [13, 14]. Body cooling seems to be unrelated to risk [15], but sudden changes of temperature at work were significantly associated with the risk of community-acquired pneumonia in one study [16]. Sleep duration and efficiency was shown to be strongly linked to susceptibility to experimental inoculation of rhinovirus, adding support to the importance of shift work as a facilitating factor [17, 18]. However, to our knowledge, the effects of long sleep duration on infections are not well established. Smoking, and to a lesser extent passive smoking, appears to be important [19, 20], and the importance of dust, particles and airborne irritants needs to be investigated.",

Inclusion criteria were, besides living in Eskilstuna, being gainfully employed and aged 25\u201364 years. A representative sample of this particular target population was created by Statistics Sweden through record-linkage between its Labour Market Register and the Total Population Register. To achieve a premeditated sample size of 2,200, based on the low observed participation rates in earlier population-based infectious disease surveillance studies with a similar commitment [21], postal invitations were sent to an age- and sex-stratified random sample of 14,008 individuals in August 2011. In particular, Bexelius et al. [21] found a moderate under-representation of men, people with low education, and people representing one-person households, and a more marked under-representation of the age stratum 18\u201339 years. For this reason, men and subjects aged 25\u201344 years were over-sampled in our study. Fig 1 shows an overview of the study design, including the infectious disease surveillance scheme.",

It comprised symptoms known to be associated with acute respiratory infections or gastroenteritis: sore throat, coughing, runny nose, headache, fever and body ache. Information about exact date of onset, contacts with people in the family, in the workplace, or elsewhere who had similar symptoms before onset, and consultation with a doctor after onset were also collected.

The used kits were returned via regular pre-paid mail. When the last kit had been returned, the participant was automatically supplied with a new one. Viral diagnosis was performed by the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems in 384-well plates [28]. The samples were analyzed for 14 different viruses: Rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); influenza A, A(H1N1) and B; parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3; human coronavirus (hCOV) 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43; enterovirus; and metapneumovirus (MPV).

This explains part of the 382 swabs that could not be matched, the remaining part is due to timing issues: when the number of days between arrival of the specimen to the lab and disease onset was greater than 15 or smaller than -5 (case where the specimen was sent before the registered onset of disease) laboratory results were not linked to symptoms reported. On the other hand, 272 sick reports could not be merged to nasal swabs. Apart from the same issue of timing, this fact might also be explained by certain symptoms reported. The absence of a nasal sample correlates well with the presence of vomiting and the absence of runny nose.",
