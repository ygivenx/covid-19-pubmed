Social distancing moves an individual from the susceptible class directly to the social distancing class and they play no role in the disease transmission. However, it is clearly unrealistic for an individual to remain completely isolated for weeks or months: individuals must venture out into the public to buy food and some will require medial care. Our long-lived models explicitly allow individuals to return from the social distancing class to the susceptible class. Our simulations show for a short-lived outbreak, that allowing individuals to return from isolation (stop applying social distancing measures) has little effect on the attack rate and maximal daily prevalence when individuals are allowed to leave for up to 4 hours each day. Therefore we focus on a short-lived outbreak with strict social distance (no return from social distancing) where we can do analytics. This seems to be the first study to address the question of partial social distancing.",

A review is provided by Funk, et. al [8], but there is a paucity of data. Several authors [9]\u2013[16] modify the transmission rate in response to some gained information. Our models incorporate a different paradigm and does not change the transmission rate; they instead reduce the number of susceptible individuals. Other authors [10], [17], [18] consider vaccination strategies, which can be considered as a form of social distancing. Our models can be viewed as vaccination models where the number vaccinated is proportional to the number of infections and death reported by the media. In addition, they also accounts for any other social distancing measures.",
