            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, is a zoonotic pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes, and the causative agent for Rift Valley fever (RVF). RVF is characterized by a high rate of abortion and fetal malformation in pregnant ruminants, febrile illness in adult ruminants, and lethal acute hepatitis in newborn lambs [1]. In humans, patients suffer an acute febrile illness with occasional complications including partial or complete blindness, hemorrhagic fever, or neurological disorders [2], [3], [4], [5]. RVFV can be transmitted through the drought-resistant eggs of infected floodwater Aedes mosquitoes which thus play a role in maintaining RVFV in endemic areas. Other mosquito species are also involved in RVFV transmission if RVFV-infected mosquito population increases subsequent to heavy rain fall or increase in mosquito habitats [6], [7], [8], [9]. RVF has been endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, and has spread into Madagascar, Comoro, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The development of an effective vaccine against RVF is important for non-endemic countries to prevent further spread of RVFV. RVFV is classified as an NIAID Category A Priority Pathogen and an overlap select agent by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Agriculture (USDA) [18]. RVFV is transmitted via aerosol, and the handling of virus should be done in biosafety level (BSL) 3+ or 4 laboratories.",

            "text": "RVFV has a tripartite negative-stranded RNA genome composed of Small (S)-, Medium (M)- and Large (L)-segments. The S-segment encodes N and NSs genes in an ambi-sense manner, the M-segment contains a single open reading frame (ORF) which encodes NSm, 78-kD protein, NSm-Gn, Gn, and Gc proteins from different AUGs and co-translational cleavage; and the L-segment encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [19], [20], [21], [22]. The nonstructural protein, NSs is a major virulence factor, and it inhibits host general transcription by inhibiting host basal transcription factor (TF) IIH; TFIIH is one of six general transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH) [23], composed of 10 different proteins; i.e., XPD, XPB, p8, p34, p44, p52, p62, MAT1, cyclin H and cdk7 [24], [25], and essential for RNA synthesis by cellular RNA polymerase I and II [26], [27]. NSs binds to and sequester TFIIH p44 [28] and also promotes the degradation of TFIIH p62 [29]. On the other hand, NSs inhibits the activation of interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 promoter by interacting with Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) and recruiting repressor complex containing histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC-3) [30], [31], while NSs promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR [32], [33], [34].",

            "text": "Smithburn vaccine generated by mouse brain passages of RVFV Entebbe strain has been sold as a veterinary vaccine in South Africa, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Egypt and Israel [11]. This vaccine itself caused abortion in pregnant ruminants and also reassorted with natural wild-type (wt) RVFV due to the use during an outbreaks [11]. MP-12 vaccine was generated by 12 serial plaque-passages in human diploid MRC-5 cells in the presence of the chemical mutagen 5-fluorouracil [35], [36]. MP-12 is highly immunogenic in ruminants, and can also induce sufficient immune response in humans [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. MP-12 is excluded from the select agent rule in the U.S., and can be handled in BSL-2 laboratories. MP-12 vaccine was manufactured by using certified MRC-5 cells as an Investigational New Drug for human clinical trials [36]. It is known that RVFV causes spontaneous truncation of NSs gene during passages in mammalian Vero or BHK-21 cells which lack functional type-I IFN system [42] or in Aedes aegypti larvae (Aag2) cells [43], [44]. We recently characterized the genetic subpopulations of MP-12 vaccine Lot 7-2-88 and found that MP-12 vaccine retains highly stable attenuation mutations in the M- and L-segments during its cultivation in MRC-5 cells [36]. Since MP-12 is attenuated by only point mutations at M- and L-segments, a potential of reversion to virulence cannot be excluded, and MP-12 requires further improvement for veterinary use. Another concern is a lack of DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) markers. In previous study, we found 27% of mice vaccinated with MP-12 induce detectable anti-NSs antibody [45]. Though the immunogenicity of MP-12 NSs is poor, the presence of anti-NSs antibody in vaccinated group will compromise DIVA strategy. Without DIVA markers, it is impossible to monitor infected animals in herds of vaccinated ruminants during RVF outbreaks.",

Although recombinant MP-12 lacking NSs gene in the S-segment encodes a negative DIVA marker [45]; i.e., a lack of anti-NSs antibody response, it does not replicate efficiently in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells. The Phlebovirus genus consists of the sandfly fever group including serologically distinct Punta Toro serocomplex, Naples serocomplex, Icoaraci serocomplex, Frijoles serocomplex, Sicilian serocomplex, RVFV, and the Uukuniemi group [46], and some of the different phlebovirus NSs are reported to be able to interfere with the host type-I IFN system [34], [47], [48]. In this study, we developed recombinant MP-12 encoding NSs of Punta Toro virus Adames strain (PTV) (rMP12-PTNSs) or Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) (rMP12-SFSNSs) in place of MP-12 NSs [46]. It should be noted that a lack of MP-12 NSs serves as a negative DIVA marker to identify animals exposed to wt RVFV, and we did not attempt to identify vaccinated animals by detecting antibody specific to anti-PTV NSs or anti-SFSV NSs. We characterized the functions of those NSs, and determined the immunogenicity and efficacy of rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs in the outbred CD1 mouse model. Our results suggested that rMP12-PTNSs, but not rMP12-SFSNSs, replicates efficiently in MRC-5 cells, while both are as efficacious as parental MP-12, and also did not induce antibodies cross-reactive to RVFV NSs. Thus, rMP12-PTNSs is an alternative candidate vaccine which can be amplified in MRC-5 cells and encodes a negative DIVA marker.",

The NSs accumulation of rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs could not be detected by mouse polyclonal antibodies against PTV or SFSV probably due to the sensitivity of the antibody to detect NSs (data not shown). To evaluate the level of each NSs accumulation, NSs of PTV or SFSV were fused to Flag-tag at the C-terminus, and the resulting viruses were designated as rMP12-PTNSs-Flag or rMP12-SFSNSs-Flag, respectively. As a control for NSs-Flag expression, we also used rMP12-NSs-Flag, which encodes an MP-12 NSs with a C-terminus Flag-tag [32]. VeroE6 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag, rMP12-C13type, rMP12-PTNSs-Flag or rMP12-SFSNSs-Flag at a m.o.i of 3, collected at 16 hpi, and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Flag antibody. As shown in \nFig. 3B\n, we confirmed that NSs of PTV Adames and SFSV were expressed at 16 hpi. Collectively, we concluded that the rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs do not promote the degradation of PKR.",

As a control for transcriptional suppression, mock-infected cells were incubated with actinomycin D (ActD) (5 \u00b5g/ml) concurrently with the EU treatment. The incorporated EU was covalently linked to azide conjugated with AlexaFluor 647, and cells were further stained with anti-RVFV antibody to detect expression of viral proteins [29]. Then, the level of EU-incorporation and expression of viral proteins were analyzed by flow cytometry. \nFig. 4A\n depicts the acquired data as a dot plot with the expression of viral proteins (anti-RVFV) on the x-axis and the incorporation of EU (RNA) on the y-axis. Quadrant gates were set to that the majority of mock infected cells (79.5%) were in the upper left quadrant, the majority of ActD treated cells (92.6%) in the lower left quadrant and the majority of anti-RVFV positive cells in either the right upper or lower quadrant. When cells were infected with MP-12, 95.2% of total cells (or 98.1% of anti-RVFV positive cells) showed reduced EU incorporation when compared to mock infected cells. Similarly, 98.99% of anti-RVFV positive cells showed reduced EU incorporation when cells were infected with rMP12-PTNSs. In contrast, when cells were infected with rMP12-SFSNSs, 78.84% of anti-RVFV positive cells still incorporated EU at the same level as mock infected cells. \nFig. 4B\n depicts the level of EU incorporation of the anti-RVFV negative population (mock and ActD) and anti-RVFV positive population (MP-12, rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs infected cells) as a histogram where the RNA fluorescence intensity (EU incorporation) is plotted on the x-axis and the cell count is plotted on the y-axis. These data suggest that MP-12 and rMP12-PTNSs are able to suppress host transcription, whereas rMP12-SFSNSs has no negative effect on host RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "To further study these observations, we used dual luciferase reporter assays to analyze the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter and two critical transcription factors for IFN-\u03b2 gene upregulation; IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-\u03baB), in the presence of MP-12, PTV or SFSV NSs [63], [64]. 293 cells were transfected with (1) IFNb-pGL3 plasmids encoding firefly luciferase (FFluc) under the human IFN-\u03b2 promoter [54], (2) 4\u00d7IRF3-luc plasmid encoding FFluc under 4 copies of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter positive regulatory domain (PRD)I/III motif (IRF-3 binding element) [55], or (3) pPRDII-luc plasmids encoding FFluc under the IFN-\u03b2 promoter PRDII motif (NF-\u03baB-binding element) [56]. As a transfection control, pRL-SV40 plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (rLuc) under the constitutively-active SV40 promoter was co-transfected with above plasmids. At 24 hours post transfection, cells were mock-infected or infected with 100 U/ml of Sendai virus (SeV), and immediately mock-transfected or transfected with in vitro synthesized RNA encoding either chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) (control) or NSs of MP-12, PTV Adames strain or SFSV. Cells were collected at 16 hpi, and the relative luciferase activity was measured. When we defined the FFluc activities obtained from SeV-infected cells transfected with IFNb-pGL3, 4\u00d7IRF3-luc or pPRDII-luc as 100%, FFluc activities of mock-infected cells transfected with IFNb-pGL3, 4\u00d7IRF3-luc or pPRDII-luc showed 5.5%, 2.8% or 22% of the SeV-infected cells, respectively (\nFig. 6 A-C\n\n, left panels, gray bars). On the other hand, rLuc activities of mock-infected cells transfected with pRL-SV40 (control plasmid) were similar or increased compared to those of SeV-infected cells transfected with pRL-SV40 (\nFig. 6 A-C\n\n, right panels, gray bars). The results suggest that SeV infection specifically induces the activation of IFN-\u03b2 gene, IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB. Compared to CAT RNA control (\nFig. 6 A-C\n\n, left panels, blue bars), cells transfected with MP-12 NSs RNA reduced the FFluc expression level derived from the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (\nFig. 6 A\n\n, left panels, red bars), IRF-3 (\nFig. 6 B\n\n, left panels, red bars) and NF-\u03baB (\nFig. 6 C\n\n, left panels, red bars). Our results were consistent with the findings that RVFV NSs inhibits the general transcription factor TFIIH and induces general transcription suppression regardless of IRF-3 or NF-\u03baB activation [28], [29]. Similarly, cells transfected with NSs RNA of PTV Adames reduced the FFluc expression level derived from the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (\nFig. 6 A\n\n, left panels, yellow bars), IRF-3 (\nFig. 6 B\n\n, left panels, yellow bars) and NF-\u03baB (\nFig. 6 C\n\n, left panels, yellow bars). Interestingly, cells transfected with SFSV NSs RNA consistently increased the rLuc activity derived from the constitutively-active SV40 promoter (\nFig. 6 A\u2013C\n\n, right panels, pink bars). SFSV NSs reduced FFluc expression level derived from the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (\nFig. 6 A\n\n, left panels, pink bars) and IRF-3 (\nFig. 6 B\n\n, left panels, pink bars), but not that from NF-\u03baB (\nFig. 6 C\n\n, left panels, pink bars). These results suggest that MP-12 NSs and PTV Adames NSs inhibit the reporter activities derived from the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB, while SFSV NSs inhibits reporter activities derived from the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and IRF-3 but not those from NF-\u03baB. In addition, SFSV NSs seems to increase the expression of constitutively active genes through a currently unknown mechanism.",

Next, we tested the efficacy of MP-12, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs against wt RVFV challenge in outbred mice. We also tested the previously reported rMP12-NSsR173A, which encodes mutant MP-12 NSs R173A [52]. Like rMP12-PTNSs, rMP12-NSsR173A inhibits host general transcription, suppresses activation of IFN-\u03b2 gene but does not promote the degradation of PKR [52]. Five-week-old outbred CD1 mice were mock-vaccinated with PBS (n = 10), or subcutaneously vaccinated with 1\u00d7105 pfu of MP-12 (n = 20), rMP12-NSR173A (n = 10), rMP12-PTNSs (n = 9) or rMP12-SFSNSs (n = 10). We used outbred mice to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of mice with different genetic background. Mice were monitored daily, and intraperitoneally challenged with 1\u00d7103 pfu of RVFV ZH501 strain at 45 days post vaccination. We performed mouse IFN-\u03b1 ELISA using mouse sera at 1 day post vaccination as described previously [45]. At 1 day post vaccination, mice vaccinated with MP-12 or rMP12-PTNSs did not increase the level of IFN-\u03b1 in sera, while serum IFN-\u03b1 was detected in some mice vaccinated with rMP12-NSsR173A (33%) or rMP12-SFSNSs (10%) (data not shown). Low levels of viremia (100 pfu/ml) were detected in some mice vaccinated with MP-12 (20% at 3 days post vaccination), rMP12-R173A (10% at 2 days post vaccination) or rMP12-PTNSs (10% at 3 days post vaccination) (data not shown). One mouse vaccinated with MP-12 that suffered viremia was dead at 13 days post vaccination, and 1 mouse vaccinated with rMP12-SFSNSs became moribund, and was euthanized at 14 days post vaccination. We analyzed the euthanized mouse vaccinated with rMP12-SFSNSs histopathologically, and found no lesions in liver and spleen, while the encephalitis characterized by mild perivascular cuffing with mononuclear cells and neuronal necrosis with infiltration of microglia were observed. Viral N antigens were diffusely detected in the parenchymal area, and neurons in hippocampus, cortex and medulla contained viral antigens (Fig. S1). None of mice vaccinated with rMP12-NSsR173A or rMP12-PTNSs died before wt RVFV challenge. The result suggests that rMP12-SFSNSs retains neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence similar to those of parental MP-12.",

Together with previous observation that rMP12-NSsR173A does not efficiently accumulate viral proteins due to PKR-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [52], this result suggests that MP-12 encoding a mutant NSs, which inhibits host general transcription including IFN-\u03b2 gene, but does not promote PKR degradation, is not immunogenic, and poorly induces neutralizing antibodies.",

Unfortunately, MP-12 vaccine does not have a DIVA marker, and further improvement of MP-12 is required for an efficient detection of naturally infected animals during RVF outbreak. We determined whether mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs can induce IgG reactive to RVFV NSs or not. For the purpose, we used IgG ELISA using C-terminus RVFV NSs [45]. We used the C-terminus NSs because the antigen is soluble, and detect anti-NSs antibody at higher sensitivity than IgG ELISA using purified whole RVFV NSs (Fig. S4). As shown in \nFig. 7D\n, none of the mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs induced detectable levels of IgG cross-reactive to the C-terminus of RVFV NSs, while 26% of mice vaccinated with MP-12 had detectable anti-NSs IgG in our IgG ELISA. The presence of anti-RVFV NSs antibody in vaccinated animals will compromise the DIVA strategy to detect animals exposed to wt RVFV. On the other hand, the rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs did not induce anti-RVFV NSs antibody detectable in this IgG ELISA, and are applicable to DIVA. We also noted that all mice vaccinated with MP-12, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs raised anti-NSs IgG after wt RVFV challenge, suggesting the vaccinations do not confer sterile immunity, and wt RVFV replicated in vaccinated mice.",

The safety and immunogenicity of MP-12 in ruminants were reported [38], [39], [40], [41], and MP-12 is excluded from HHS/USDA select agent rule in the U.S. The MP-12 vaccine generated from the master seed currently has the Investigational New Drug (IND) status in the U.S., and was manufactured by using certified MRC-5 cells for human clinical trials [36]. We recently characterized the genetic subpopulations of an MP-12 vaccine lot, and found that the major population of MP-12 is highly stable and no reversions to the parental ZH548 strain were detected [36]. Different from viral passages in MRC-5 cells, RVFV induces NSs gene truncation during passages in cells lacking an intact type-I IFN system [43], [44]. The genetic stability and consistency of immunogenicity profiles are important factors in vaccine development, and the use of MRC-5 cells may be an important factor to maintain the original populations of MP-12 during manufacturing. One study also suggested that MP-12 strain with unknown passage history caused abortion and teratogenic effect in lambs when it was used for pregnant ewes at 35 to 56 days of pregnancy [65]. In this study, we aimed to develop MP-12 encoding functional NSs gene derived from serologically distinct phleboviruses to encode a DIVA marker in MP-12 while retaining the original efficacy and ability to efficiently replicate in MRC-5 cells. To encode a DIVA marker without affecting the ability to replicate in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells, we designed MP-12 encoding serologically distinct phlebovirus NSs (PTV NSs or SFSV NSs), which is known to inhibit host IFN-\u03b2 [34], [48]. The rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs efficiently inhibited host IFN-\u03b2 gene up-regulation induced by the MP-12 replication. Interestingly, rMP12-PTNSs but not rMP12-SFSNSs replicated efficiently in MRC-5 cells, indicating that rMP12-PTNSs can be considered as an alternative candidate vaccine of MP-12 with DIVA marker, which can be produced by using MRC-5 cells. Any MP-12 variants including rMP12-SFSNSs, which does not replicate in MRC-5 cells, will require genetic stability test in type-I IFN-incompetent cells to optimize the vaccine production.",

On the other hand, the immunogenicity and efficacy of MP-12 encoding NSs mutant, which inhibits host general transcription but not PKR, have not been studied. The rMP12-NSsR173A inhibits host general transcription including IFN-\u03b2 gene without promoting the degradation of PKR [52]. In this study, we found that rMP12-PTNSs inhibits host general transcription including IFN-\u03b2 gene, and does not promote the degradation of PKR. Mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs but not rMP12-NSsR173A induced high level of neutralizing antibodies. The result suggested that the host transcription suppression induced by RVFV NSs negatively affects the vaccine efficacy if PKR is not inhibited. On the other hand, MP-12 encoding PTV NSs was highly efficacious even though it induces host general transcription suppression without inducing PKR degradation. It might be possible that PTV NSs has other unknown functions to support RVFV replication in the presence of host general transcription suppression. We noted that SFSV NSs possesses an unknown function to increase host gene expression, as indicated by up-regulation of a constitutively expressed SV40 reporter gene (\nFig. 6\n). The gene up-regulation was induced independently of PKR degradation, and may contribute to consistently high level of anti-N IgG in rMP12-SFSNSs vaccinated mice. Further studies are currently being conducted in our laboratory to elucidate the detailed mechanism of PTV NSs and SFSV NSs in host gene expression. Both SFSV and PTV cause self-limiting febrile illness in humans, and no significant diseases in animals. We observed that one mouse vaccinated with rMP12-SFSNSs was dead at 9 days post vaccination with viral encephalitis (Fig. S1). Vaccine-related viral encephalitis was also observed in mice vaccinated with parental MP-12 (data not shown), and we did not observe any significant increase of mouse death related to rMP12-SFSNSs vaccination compared to MP-12 vaccination. Considering that MP-12 vaccine encodes fully functional NSs of RVFV, rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs are similar with, or most probably more attenuated than parental MP-12 due to a lack of function to promote PKR degradation. Since mouse is the most susceptible species to RVFV infection, the vaccine safety should be test in ruminants and nonhuman primates before further consideration as a vaccine candidate.",
