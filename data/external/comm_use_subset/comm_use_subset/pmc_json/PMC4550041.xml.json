            "text": "The West African outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) began in Guinea in December 2013 [1]. The outbreak involved sustained transmission in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [2]. By September 14, 2014, the total number of probable and confirmed cases was 4507, with 2296 deaths recorded from five countries in West Africa namely, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone [3]. The first known case of EVD was reported in Nigeria on 20th July 2014, through a man who travelled to Lagos, Nigeria, via Lom\u00e9, Togo and Accra, Ghana [4]. As of 17th September 2014, the total number of confirmed EVD cases in Nigeria was 19 (15 in Lagos and 4 in Port Harcourt) of which 12 had survived and seven reported dead. Four hundred and seventy contacts had completed 21 days of follow up necessary to rule out EVD infection. The news of EVD spread into Nigeria created widespread media attention, which initially focused mainly on the high infectivity and case fatality, with the potential to create fear and panic. Also, the process of infection control and prevention necessary for the control of Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) like EVD involves the use of personal protective equipment, quarantine, and isolation [5], all of which may be associated with fear and anxiety. Public apprehension of newly detected emerging infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality had been previously described. Joffe et al. [6] described pattern of public response to emerging infectious diseases like EVD. This general public response pattern includes distancing the disease from self, blame of particular entities for the disease\u2019s origin and/or spread, and stigmatization of those who have contracted it and/or who are represented as having intensified its spread. The process may be driven by worry, fear and anxiety, which necessitate a psychosocial intervention as part of all outbreak response to EIDs like EVD. In a study to assess the psychological impact of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome on hospital employees, about 10 % of the respondents had experienced high levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms [7]. Researches conducted during EVD outbreaks tend to focus on clinical manifestations and epidemiology of EVD with little or no study on psychosocial impact or distress associated with EVD. A study in Democratic Republic of Congo described the feelings and experiences of survivors of Ebola epidemic [8]. They described psychosocial consequences among survivors to include fear of falling seriously ill, denial, fear of being accused by neighbors and shame. Others included rejection by society, belief that the infection was a divine punishment, lack of income, and intense grief for colleagues who did not survive the epidemic. The previous study did not include use of a standardized instrument for evaluation of psychological distress and social support available to the respondents. No previous study that employed the use of standardized instruments like GHQ or OSS to measure psychological distress or social support among survivors and contacts of EVD or their relatives was found after a literature review. We set out to determine the prevalence and pattern of psychological distress among the survivors, relatives and contacts of EVD. We also assessed the social support available for the survivors, relatives and contacts of EVD. Finally, we determined factors associated with psychological distress.",

We also asked if respondents had loss a relation due to the EVD outbreak. The General Health Questionnaire 12-item version (GHQ 12) was used to assess psychological distress among the study participants. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) is a screening questionnaire, designed for screening individuals with a diagnosable psychiatric disorder [12]. The GHQ 12 does not generate specific psychiatric diagnosis but rather screens for individuals with possible disorders. In its original version, it had 60 items (GHQ-60), which were reduced to 30 (GHQ-30), and 12 items (GHQ-12) [13]. The 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) is the most extensively used screening instrument for common mental disorders in addition to being a more general measure of psychological wellbeing. The psychometric properties of GHQ 12 have been evaluated in several studies [14, 15]. The Oslo Social Support Scale (OSS) was used to assess patients\u2019 social support base during the period. The Oslo 3-item Social Support Scale provides a brief measure of social functioning and has been considered a good predictor of mental health [16]. It covers different fields of social support, as it measures the number of people the respondent feels close to, the interest and concern shown by others, and ease of obtaining practical help. The Oslo Social Support Scale had been validated in Nigeria [17]. Respondents who answered \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cvery difficult\u201d to the question \u201cHow easy can you get help from neighbors?\u201d were defined as having difficulty getting help from neighbors during need. Respondents who answered \u201cnone\u201d or \u201c1\u20132\u201d to the question \u201chow many people are close to you that you can count on if you have serious problems?\u201d were defined as having less than 3 people who they can count on for help for serious problem. Finally those who answered \u201cno\u201d, \u201clittle\u201d, or \u201cuncertain\u201d to the question \u201chow much concern do people show in what you are doing\u201d, were defined as having people showing little concern in what they are doing. Due to the interest in the pattern of psychological distress and social support among the respondents we analyzed each variable in the GHQ 12 and OSS separately instead of using aggregate scores",

Though the individual psychological distress does not amount to a neuropsychiatric disorder, it does indicate the presence of some psychological distress among the respondents that may have the potential to progress if not properly managed. EVD can be perceived as a life-threatening event that meets a key diagnostic criterion of PTSD in DSM [19]. The development of PTSD following life-threatening event has been demonstrated among Nigerians [20] and among health workers who had contact with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [7]. Other less severe disorders caused by reaction to extremely stressful situations such as acute stress reaction and adjustment disorders could also present with the above psychological distress. The psychological distress of being unable to concentrate could be mistaken for cognitive impairment by the clinical management team if it occurs in a patient with EVD, could be confused for viral encephalopathy or onset of brain damage secondary to EVD infection. A case of adjustment disorder, in a survivor of the Nigerian EVD outbreak, initially diagnosed as having brain damage secondary to viral encephalitis is an example [21]. Losing a relation during this EVD outbreak was significantly associated with being unhappy or depressed. This could be dismissed as a usual response to bereavement in people, but the feelings of depression (whether from normal grief or psychopathological) could have implication for the management of patients with EVD or for the contact tracing team while monitoring contacts for clinical manifestation of EVD. It could affect judgment and thus reduce cooperation with either the clinical management team or contact tracing team. Feelings of depression could also cause patients or contacts of EVD to tolerate emerging symptoms of EVD thereby not reporting them to the management team. This could complicate overall clinical impression of the patient or cause problems with determining the exact time of onset of clinical symptoms. The effect of an EVD contact, with feelings of depression, failing to disclose important clinical symptoms may lead to delayed or failed recognition of EVD onset with far reaching public health importance. The psychological stress of bereavement can mimic severe depression but also bereavement has long been described as a risk factor for development of depression [22]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that risk factors for common mental health problems arising from the EVD outbreak such as witnessing and caring for individuals who are severely ill, perceived life threat, substantial mortality and bereavement, and the deaths of trained health care workers, in conjunction with the lack of well-trained mental health professionals in countries experiencing EVD outbreak in West Africa could amplify the risks of developing enduring psychological distress and progression to psychopathology by those affected [23]. Although the psychological distress described in this study may not be definitive psychological disorder, there is the need for follow up assessment of the survivors, contacts and relations.",

Poor social support was only a problem to less than a quarter of the respondents. This may have been due to the relatives not being aware of what the respondents were going through. Overall, only few of the respondents demonstrated poor social support, respondents who had little or no interest shown in their activities were more likely to lack self-confidence. Having no tertiary education, which was protective of inability to concentrate, may not be an entirely positive finding because it could reflect the lack of insight into the implication of an infection with EVD by those without tertiary education. The study found loss of a relation to be an independent predictor of feelings of unhappiness or depression and inability to concentrate. Contacts or survivors who have lost close relations should be considered at high risk of developing psychological distress or even psychological disorders. Loss of a relation is a traumatic experience that has been shown to be a predictor of PTSD [20] and depression [24] among persons exposed to traumatic experience in Nigeria. Therefore the psychosocial response team for EVD outbreak should prioritize this subgroup of contacts and survivors for special monitoring and evaluation. The contact tracing teams following up this subgroup of contacts should include a member of the psychosocial response team with training in detection of psychological distress/disorders.",

Only few survivors were sampled which limited the ability to independently look at the dynamics of psychological distress among them. The evaluation could not interview the anticipated number of relatives because some of the contacts did not inform their immediate family members about their status as EVD contacts and therefore could not be interviewed. Despite these limitations, we are confident the findings of this study reflect the possible psychological distress following being a survivor or contact of EVD or a relation to any.",

The clinical teams managing EVD patients should be trained on recognition of psychological distress among the patients and recognition of common psychiatric disorders like depression that could follow EVD infection, and special attention should be paid to those who have lost a relation. We also recommended the follow up of all survivors/contacts with increased risk of developing psychological distress or disorders for a minimum period of 6 months by a mental health specialist for early detection of mental health disorders following EVD. The findings of this study were shared with the Ebola emergency operation center in Lagos and the main findings were equally presented to the meeting of the Association of Psychiatrists and Allied Professionals in Nigeria.",
