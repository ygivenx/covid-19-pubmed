            "text": "Sequence similarity is often considered the key feature to investigate evolutionary conservation of coding transcripts (Kent, 2002). Yet, knowledge of secondary structure provides important insights into the biological function of RNAs by allowing the study of physical properties, such as for instance molecular interactions (Bellucci et al., 2011). In most cases, information about the RNA folding complements sequence analysis (Wan et al., 2014) and is useful to understand their mechanisms of action. MicroRNA precursors, for example, are processed by DGCR8 only if properly folded in hairpin loop structures (Ha and Kim, 2014). Similarly, the architecture of ribosomal RNAs evolves in a self-contained way through conservation of stem loops present in ancient species (Bokov and Steinberg, 2009, p. 200; Petrov et al., 2015), indicating distinct requirements for structural elements.",

The vast majority of lncRNAs seems to evolve under little or no selective constraints, undergo almost no purifying selection, show poor expression, and do not have often easily identifiable orthologs (Diederichs, 2014; Ulitsky, 2016). Indeed, the average sequence homology of evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs between human and mouse is 20% and drops to 5% between human and fish (Ulitsky, 2016). Thus, primary structure does not provide relevant information to study lncRNA conservation and secondary structure could be used for better characterization. Similarly to lncRNAs, the transcriptomes of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses retain their fold even if sequences mutate rapidly (Chursov et al., 2013), which indicates that secondary structure investigation could be key to reveal evolutionary properties.",

CROSSalign, available at our webpages http://service.tartaglialab.com//new_submission/crossalign, is based on the combination of two methods: (1) Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS), which is an algorithm trained on experimental data to predict RNA secondary structure profiles without sequence length restrictions and at single-nucleotide resolution (Delli Ponti et al., 2017); (2) the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to assess the similarity of two profiles of different lengths (Giorgino, 2009). DTW flexibility allows managing profiles of different lengths without having to sacrifice computational time. The comparisons of structural profiles will lead to a broad applicability of our methodology. Indeed, profiles have already started to be employed to assess structural similarities of large molecules such as ribosomal RNAs (Lavender et al., 2015).",

In mouse it consists of 7.5 copies (8.5 in humans) of 26-mers separated by U-rich linkers (Figure 2A) (Brockdorff, 2002). In 2015 and 2017, two reports on the XIST A-repeat structure were published (Fang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017), both making use of experimental techniques to infer XIST structure.

The sequences were then divided into a reference (25 transcripts) and a positive (25 transcripts) set, and we built a list of negative cases by shuffling 25 times the original RepA. Both the positive and negative sets have poor sequence similarity (<35% computed with EMBOSS; see Materials and Methods). We used CROSSalign to compute all scores for the positive and negative set against the corresponding reference set and used the minimal distance to assign the closest match to each transcript.

Importantly, the correct coordinates of human RepA within mouse XIST rank second in our analysis (CROSSalign distance 0.086; p-value < 10\u22126), while the best match is a miRNA-containing the gene Mirg (ENSMUSG00000097391) and the two secondary structure profiles show a strong correlation of 0.92 (Figure 4B). Interestingly, even if little information is available on Mirg, the transcript is prevalently expressed in the embryo (Schmitt et al., 2014). This result unveils a previously unreported relationship between XIST and Mirg, in which structural and functional homologies can be linked. Intriguingly, also the second best result, Rian (ENSMUSG00000097451), is expressed in embryo, while no information is available on the third and fourth hits (ENSMUSG00000107391 and ENSMUSG00000085312).

Other clusters (red and green; Figure 8B) showed significant distance in structure (from 0.06 to 0.09 of CROSSalign distance; p-value < 10\u22126) that is not identifiable by sequence similarity (~85% sequence similarity). This result suggests that HIV could have evolved maintaining a similar sequence but different structures, as previously reported in literature (Rizvi and Panganiban, 1993).",

DTW has been previously applied in different fields, especially pattern recognition and data mining (Keogh and Pazzani, 2000; Rath and Manmatha, 2003), but has never been used to investigate structural alignments of RNA molecules. Since CROSS has no sequence length restrictions and shows strong performances on both coding and non-coding RNAs (Delli Ponti et al., 2017) the combination with DTW allows very accurate comparisons of structural profiles. On our test set, thermodynamic approaches such as RNAstructure (Reuter and Mathews, 2010) and RNAfold (Lorenz et al., 2016) showed appreciable but yet lower performances than CROSS. Moreover, their restrictions on sequence length (Lu et al., 2009; Hajiaghayi et al., 2012) limit the applicability to large domains (Cirillo et al., 2017).",

For example the information of NMR chemical shift could enhance the accuracy of secondary structure prediction (Zhang and Frank, 2018).

The open begin and end (OBE-DTW) algorithm was employed to compare profiles of different lengths. Indeed, the standard DTW method imposes the same begins and ends to the two profiles that are compared, while OBE-DTW searches for the profile of shorter length within the other one. Accordingly, we used standard DTW to compare profiles of similar lengths (i.e., one sequence is < 3 times longer than the other), while OBE-DTW was employed to search for modules within larger profiles (e.g., RepA within the complete XIST sequence; XIST is ~45 times longer than RepA).",

We also tested different normalizations of DTW outputs (including normalization by length of the shorter or longer profile) and we found that the normalization based on the lengths of both profiles is optimal.
