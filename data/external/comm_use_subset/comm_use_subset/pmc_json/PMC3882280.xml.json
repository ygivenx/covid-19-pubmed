Experimental infection of mice with the canine isolate demonstrated that CnPnV is able to replicate in the mouse lung tissue inducing pneumonia [15].

All the dogs involved were mixed bred and included animals aged from 2.5 months to 12 years; neither age nor gender predisposition was evident for the CIRD occurrence. Pest control was carried out only sporadically in the shelter, but there were no systematic measures against rodent and insect populations. Housed dogs were routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper (CDV), canine adenoviruses (CAdVs) and Leptospira spp., while no specific vaccine for prophylaxis of CIRD was employed. Respiratory signs were generally mild consisting of cough and/or nasal discharge with no evidence of fever. Haematological parameters were not evaluated. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected from two CIRD-affected mixed-breed dogs, a 7-month-old male and a 3-year-old female. Swabs were immersed in 1.5 ml viral transport medium consisting of Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1000 IU/ml penicillin, 1000 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 10 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B.",

Additional RT-PCR assays with the enzyme mix SuperScript\u00ae II RT/Platinum\u00ae Taq Hi Fi (Invitrogen srl) and subsequent sequencing attempts were performed to close gaps between assembled contigs and to sequence unresolved genomic regions using primers designed on the alignment of the reference CnPnV strains with the closely related MPV. All the PCR amplicons were cloned and consensus sequences were elaborated using at least three clones per fragment. To determine the sequence of the 3\u2032-leader and of the 5\u2032-trailer ends (genome sense), viral RNA was reverse transcribed using NS2 negative-sense and L positive-sense primers, respectively, and the resulting cDNAs were amplified using a 5\u2032 RACE kit (5\u2032 RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Invitrogen srl), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Serosurveys conducted in wild rodents in UK gave inconsistent results, with antibodies being detected in certain species of wild voles and mice [37] and in wild grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) [38], but not in wild house mice (Mus musculus) [39]. In Italy there are no recent data about the MPV circulation in laboratory or wild rodents. However, if the mouse virus circulates in the field, there are several chances for its species jump to the canine host. In this scenario, kenneled dogs should be highly exposed to the cross-species transmission, considering that shelters usually attract large populations of rodents and pest control measures are not carried out on a regular basis. Apart from kenneled dogs, hunting dogs could be also exposed to MPV infection through occasional contacts with wild rodents during hunting activities. Introduction of MPV-like viruses in Italy may have occurred through migration of infected wild rodents or importation of infected dogs from other countries.",

The horizontal line represents the extargenic regions, specifically the 3\u2032-leader (Le), 5\u2032-trailer (Tr) and intergenic regions. Nucleotide (nt) length for extragenic sequences are indicated above the map; below the gene map are the gen coordinates, the nt lengths of the mRNAs and the amino acid (aa) lengths of the predicted proteins. P and M2 genes are predicted to encode each for two different proteins. B, C. CnPnV/Bari/100-12 leader (B) and trailer (C) regions aligned with the analogous sequences of other pneumoviruses.
