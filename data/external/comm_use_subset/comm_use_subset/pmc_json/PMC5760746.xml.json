            "text": "Powassan virus (POWV) is the only North American member of the tick-borne encephalitis complex (TBE-C) of viruses, which are transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Other members of the TBE-C include the following flaviviruses: tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Eastern Europe and Western Asia, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus in Siberia, Kyasanur Forest disease virus in India, Alkhurma virus in Saudi Arabia, and Louping ill virus in the United Kingdom. TBE-C viruses can cause a wide range of disease in humans, from mild febrile illness with biphasic fever to encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever (1). POWV is composed of two genetically and ecologically distinct lineages (2). Prototype POWV (lineage I) is transmitted primarily by Ixodes cookei, a tick with a narrow vertebrate host range that rarely feeds on humans. Powassan virus lineage II, also known as deer tick virus (DTV), is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, a tick with a broad host range that also transmits the infectious agents that cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis (3). Since the late 1990s, POWV infections have been reported in the Northeastern and Midwestern parts of the United States as well as in Canada, and incidence is increasing (4). Because the territory of I. scapularis is expanding and the prevalence of POWV in ticks and mammals is increasing, POWV poses an increasing threat (5, 6). In a recent survey, I. scapularis ticks collected from the northwest quadrant of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2012 demonstrated a POWV infection frequency of 4.67% (7). This is similar in frequency to a survey conducted in that same area in 1998 (8). Although POWV is rarely diagnosed as a cause of encephalitis, infections can be severe, and neurologic sequelae are common (9). Additionally, the potential for concurrent transmission with other tick-borne pathogens, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has not been previously studied in North America.",

Serologic testing remains the primary method for diagnosis of POWV infection, with an emphasis on the detection of POWV-specific IgM antibodies in serum or plasma. Until recently, commercial laboratory testing has been unavailable for POWV in the United States. Prior to this, a positive POWV IgM enzyme immunoassay (EIA) result confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), a 4-fold or greater increase in titers between acute- and convalescent-phase sera, or culture or direct identification of virus-specific nucleic acids at a state public health laboratory or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (11) has been the mainstay of diagnostic testing.",

The first test in the panel is a highly sensitive, commercial TBE-C screen by EIA. Per the manufacturer, cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses is expected, particularly with West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) antibody-positive samples. Samples that are screen positive are then confirmed for POWV by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Performance characteristics of the test panel were optimized, and validation studies were performed to assess the analytical sensitivity, reproducibility, and specificity/cross-reactivity of the serologic test panel for use in routine diagnostic testing.",

All but one of the POWV encephalitis samples obtained from the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) with PRNT90 titers of 1:20 were detected by the TBE-C EIA screen and confirmatory POWV IFA. A PRNT90 titer of 1:20 was determined to be the limit of detection (LOD) for the serologic test panel and was confirmed as such using known PRNT90-positive samples (Table 1). At these screening dilutions, the serologic panel showed an analytical sensitivity of 89% (Table 1). Reproducibility studies showed 100% accordance (k = 1.0).",

            "text": "Studies confirm that serologic cross-reactions among the flaviviruses are significant and more frequently observed with IgG antibody detection assays. Both commercial EIAs and IgG IFAs demonstrate poor specificity overall, with IFA being slightly better than EIA. The overall specificity of flavivirus IgG EIAs is reported between 16 and 38% and improves slightly to 29 to 84% for IgG IFAs (12). The addition of the POWV IgG IFA to the TBE-C EIA screen eliminated 35% of the cross-reactivity seen with the EIA alone. The immunological maturation of the IgG antibody response tends to foster the formation of antibodies directed to epitopes with greater likelihood for cross-reactivity (13). While the specificity of flavivirus PRNTs detecting neutralizing IgG antibodies is high, this often comes at the cost of assay sensitivity. A PRNT50 tends to be more sensitive in detecting early antibody responses, given the less stringent endpoint of >50% reduction in plaques, versus the highly specific >90% plaque reduction described here (14). Also, low correlation between PRNT and IFA titer is not surprising since the IFA detects antibodies to a variety of structural and nonstructural viral proteins, whereas the PRNT primarily detects neutralizing antibodies directed to the envelope (E) protein of the virus (13). When tested against non-tick-borne flavivirus samples, the POWV IgG IFA described here demonstrated an analytical specificity of 65%, comparable to that of other commercial flavivirus IgG IFAs (15).",

            "text": "The overall cross-reactivity associated with detection of flavivirus IgM antibodies is significantly lower than that seen with IgG antibodies, and IgM IFA specificity was 20 to 30% higher than IgM EIA when patients with suspected flavivirus infections were screened for several different viruses (12). The addition of the POWV IgM IFA to the TBE-C EIA screen eliminated 55% of the cross-reactivity seen with the IgM EIA alone. Many commercially available flavivirus IgM-specific serologic tests report sensitivity lower than that seen with IgG assays, due primarily to the fact that PRNT is considered the gold standard for the differential serodiagnosis. Published reports confirm that, in patients with primary flavivirus infection, the IgM response likely consists of antibodies with minimal to no virus-neutralizing capacity (16, 17). In a study assessing the performance of a commercially available WNV IgM EIA, 14 of 44 CDC IgM protocol-negative samples were found positive. The apparent lack of IgM specificity observed with that assay may be attributed to the use of PRNT to confirm IgM positives as part of the CDC protocol (18). In studies where convalescent-phase samples can be collected from patients 2 to 4 weeks after infection, the use of PRNT may be helpful to confirm the accuracy of acute-phase detection of IgM. In the studies presented here, we were limited by design to samples collected only at the time of clinical presentation, and therefore, follow-up convalescent-phase samples were not available. The lack of a reliable and accurate predicate assay for use as a gold standard when developing flavivirus IgM assays requires further study.",

In the current study, one POWV IgM IFA-positive sample was confirmed positive by POWV RT-PCR with the remaining IgM IFA-positive samples lacking detectable viral genome. Studies performed with WNV-positive patients show that viremia can be detected for an average of 7 days and that IgM antibody becomes detectable a median of 4 days after the midpoint of the interval for RNA detection, for an overlap of only 1 to 2 days (20).

Only a few state health labs and the CDC offer this testing, and the labor-intensive nature of the confirmatory tests often delays the reporting of final results beyond the period of clinical utility. In addition, testing is usually limited to patients presenting with neurologic complications; therefore, little is known regarding the overall prevalence of and clinical symptoms associated with POWV infection. Limited data regarding cocirculation of Lyme disease and POWV seroprevalence in the Midwest have been published (21). The test panel described here allows for the simple and efficient detection of acute POWV infection. However, due to the cross-reactivity seen for all flavivirus IgG assays, it is imperative that exposure to other flaviviruses and travel and vaccination history be considered when interpreting IgG test results. This panel is a diagnostic tool that can play an important role in further defining the full spectrum of POWV disease.",
