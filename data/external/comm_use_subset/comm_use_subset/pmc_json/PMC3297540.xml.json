In 2003 SARS-coronavirus (CoV) appeared in Asia and then spread globally, causing greater than 40% mortality in individuals over 60 years of age [1]. Since 1997 highly pathogenic avian influenza, influenza A subtype H5N1, has resulted in high mortality rates (between 33% and 100% depending on the population) [2]. Finally in 2009 swine-origin influenza virus A (SOIV) subtype H1N1 emerged in the Americas and led to a pandemic. As Neumann et al. have observed, this virus shares many characteristics with 1918 influenza which resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths [3]. Furthermore, as Ilyushina et al. have shown, SOIV may mutate into more pathogenic forms in as little as ten passages in cell culture [4].",

Deriving gene expression signatures of high pathogenicity that are robust to biological and experimental variation would be immensely valuable, both in the understanding of pathogenicity as well as in the surveillance of emerging infections. We define a signature as the minimum number of biological variables (here, expressed genes) required to (a) discriminate the phenotype of interest from other phenotypes, (b) identify replicates of the same phenotype, and (c) provide cohesive information about the underlying biological complexity [6]. However, the derivation of gene expression signatures from multiple, independent studies is hindered by a number of factors including the absence of standard experimental protocols, biological variability, and limited sample sizes. Meta-analysis, the analysis of independent but related studies, offers one strategy for overcoming these obstacles.",

To approach this question we assembled a compendium of host transcriptional responses to low-, medium-, and high-pathogenic infections (which we designate as LPIs, MPIs, and HPIs, respectively) and applied a battery of meta-analysis techniques. Using these techniques we identified signatures of either a digital nature (oppositely expressed in LPIs and HPIs with respect to mock infections) or an analog nature (expressed in a continuum from LPIs to HPIs). We then compared these signatures on the basis of their capacity to predict the outcome of an independent transcriptome experiment. The most accurate signature was analog in nature and implicated excessive chemokine expression and cell recruitment in the development of lethal respiratory infections.",

Hierarchical clustering of the log-ratio data showed that two clusters of genes differed in expression with respect to each other and with respect to HPI vs. LPI (Additional File 1, Figure. S1). This suggested that gene signatures could be identified on the basis of opposite directionality with respect to mock infections. To identify these signatures more rigorously we applied two methods of meta-analysis. The first signature comprised 74 genes identified on the basis of statistical tests for differential expression in each biological condition whose results were combined by Fisher's summary statistic (Additional File 2, Figure. S2A; gene list as Additional File 3, Table S1). The second signature comprised 265 genes identified as a module by similar patterns of co-expression and annotation co-membership (Additional File 2, Figure. S2B, S2C; gene list as Additional File 4, Table S2). Due to their opposite directionality in different pathogenicities, we referred to these signatures as digital in nature. A third signature comprised 57 genes and was derived from the direct comparison of expression in HPIs vs. LPIs without reference to mock infections. Additional normalization allowed inter-array comparisons, and a fold-change-based z-test was used to determine differential expression (gene list as Additional File 5, Table S3). Because these genes varied directly between pathogenicities, we referred to this signature as analog in nature. Limited degrees of overlap were observed among the different signatures indicating that the three methods identified different features in the data.",

The expression of each signature set of genes was analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA), and the degree to which LPI-, MPI-, and HPI-associated conditions clustered proximally to conditions of the same pathogenicity and distally from conditions of other pathogenicities was compared. We also compared the ordering and overall separation of the pathogenicity clusters, both by visual inspection and by percentage variance explained. We reasoned that a more effective signature would result in greater separation of pathogenicities oriented along a dimension that also explained a higher proportion of the total variance [7]. Using all the genes in the compendium as input for PCA (i.e., no signatures), the native compendium showed little apparent structure (Figure 2A). Conditions did not discretely cluster by pathogenicity, nor did pathogenicities separate along either first or second principal components (PC1 or PC2, respectively). Using the digital gene signatures, more structure became apparent (Figure 2B, C). Conditions were ordered by severity of pathogenicity along PC1, and the total variance explained by PC1 ranged from 9% to 13% (for the module map- and Fisher's statistic-derived signatures, respectively; x-axis in Figure 2B, C). However, the highest degree of clustering and separation was obtained using the analog signature. Conditions clustered more tightly by pathogenicity (particularly in the case of HPI) using this signature than other signatures, and PC1 accounted for a greater proportion of the total variance, 18% (Figure 2D). PCA therefore indicated that the analog signature resulted in the most effective discrimination of host profiles by pathogenicity. We note that the relatively low amount of variance explained by PC1 in the case of each signature was consistent with the presence of significant heterogeneity in the compendium. This heterogeneity may be attributable to a number of different factors including the variety of viruses, times post-infection, mouse strains, laboratories, and technical platforms represented in the compendium. Therefore, we compared signatures on the basis of the relative increases in variance explained by PC1 which aligned with pathogenicity in each case.",

We reasoned that a more effective signature would result in stronger correlations (higher Pearson correlation coefficients, or PCCs) among similar pathogenicities and weaker correlations (lower PCCs) among dissimilar pathogenicities. On a scatter plot of PCCs to exemplar LPI and HPI profiles, more samples would appear in two quadrants, with more LPI samples in quadrant II (LPI-high/HPI-low) and more HPI samples in quadrant IV (LPI-low/HPI-high) where quadrants are defined by an equal partitioning of the PCC scatter plot plane at (0.5, 0.5). Using all of the genes in the native compendium, LPI and HPI samples appeared primarily in one quadrant, high for both LPI and HPI (Figure 3A). This indicated that LPI and HPI transcriptional profiles were correlated overall (for the majority of genes) and that LPI and HPI samples separated poorly from each other on the basis of overall transcriptional profiles. Digital gene signatures resulted in improved segregation of samples by pathogenicity, as indicated by increased numbers of LPI and HPI samples in quadrants II and IV, respectively (white regions in Figure 3B, C). However, the analog signature resulted in the largest overall segregation of biological samples, with the highest number of LPI and HPI samples appearing in opposite quadrants (Figure 3D). Therefore PCA and PCC scatter plots were consistent in indicating that the analog signature achieved the best separation of transcriptional profiles by pathogenicity.",

PCC scatter plots were generated using the test set samples and the same LPI and HPI exemplars as above (in Figure 3). We again reasoned that the most effective gene signature would yield the best opposite-quadrant separation of LPI and HPI samples. Comparing the better-scoring digital signature (i.e., generated by Fisher's statistic) and the analog signature, we found that the analog signature yielded the best segregation of test set samples (Figure 4). In particular samples from the lethal variant MA1 CA/04 correlated strongly with the exemplar HPI, indicating that this and other HPIs resulted in similar transcriptional profiles for these genes (Figure 4C). Counting the number of LPI and HPI test set samples appearing in quadrants II and IV, respectively, and considering these as correctly predicted, we found that the analog signature resulted in an accuracy rate of 83% (15 of 18 samples), exceeding the rates obtained using all genes (0 of 18) or the better-scoring digital signature (3 of 18).",

Genes up-regulated in HPI were associated with inflammation, apoptosis, cell signaling, and cell proliferation, while genes down-regulated in HPI were associated with cytochrome P450-related enzymatic activity. Protein-protein interactions linked many of these genes together indicating possible cooperative effects (Additional File 6, Figure. S3A, S3B).

We determined the proportion of signature genes whose expression was ordered by pathogenicity (from least to greatest in LPI, MPI, and HPI, or vice versa) and compared this proportion to those expected by chance or observed among all genes. Assuming an equal distribution of genes among pathogenicity groups, we expected 33% to display one of these two patterns by chance. By comparison we observed that 43% of all genes in the compendium displayed these patterns (Figure 5B). However, an even greater proportion of analog signature genes displayed these patterns, 81%, consistent with a correlation between expression and pathogenicity (Figure 5C). Using a binomial distribution we calculated the chance enrichment of genes being proportionally expressed with pathogenicity to be p < 0.0019 in the case of Figure 5B (among all compendium genes) and p < 6.6 \u00d7 10-23 in the case of Figure 5C (among analog signature genes). Furthermore, if we considered the distribution of gene profiles among all compendium genes to be expected, the enrichment of proportionally expressed genes in the analog signature was statistically significant at p < 1.6 \u00d7 10-13.",

A number of these have focused on respiratory viruses including several which resulted in lethality in experimental animal models. What distinguished these infections from others where experimental animals recovered was the subject of our analysis. To this end we assembled a compendium of transcriptome measurements from the lungs of mice and used meta-analysis to determine gene signatures that distinguished high- from low-pathogenicity infections. To our knowledge ours is the first meta-analysis study to focus on high-pathogenicity infections (HPIs). Previous studies have applied meta-analysis to infection data but focused on more general features of disease. For example, Jenner and Young analyzed the transcriptomes of various host species (mice, macaques, and humans) infected by bacteria or viruses and identified a signature of approximately 500 genes [8]. This signature showed that TLRs and pathogen-mediated signalling were broadly activated during infection but did not identify features resulting in animal lethality. Likewise Pennings et al. examined the transcriptional profiles of lung inflammation (in mice and macaques) due to various factors (including viruses, bacteria, chemicals, and allergens) and derived a 383-gene signature up-regulated during inflammation [9]. This signature focused on the interferon response and immune signalling, but likewise no correlate of pathogenicity was identified. In addition both studies relied mainly on hierarchical clustering to determine signatures of interest. While hierarchical clustering provides a useful overview of high-dimensional data, it has the disadvantage of lacking a strong statistical basis (i.e., hypothesis testing) and its results (gene clusters) can be difficult to relate to specific outcomes.",

In previous studies mice lacking SPP1 and CCL5 were found to clear influenza infection with no adverse effects [10,11], while mice lacking CCR2 survived infection by a mouse-adapted influenza A virus that killed wild-type mice [12].

However, the analog signature displayed additional coherence, encoding multiple chemokines for the same receptor, namely MIG (CXCL9), IP-10 (CXCL10), and I-TAC (CXCL11) which all serve as ligands for the receptor CXCR3 [13]. CXCR3 is expressed on the surface of Th1 cells as well as NK and NKT cells and regulates the migration of these cells to sites of infection. Recent evidence indicates that CXCR3 engagement may drive further recruitment and inflammation, resulting in a positive feedback loop that may contribute to pathogenicity [13]. The analog signature also included genes for chemokines that bind the CCR3 receptor, specifically MCP-3 (CCL7) and MCP-4 (CCL13). CCR3 is the major receptor expressed on eosinophils and has previously been shown to have a role in the promotion of lung inflammation [14]. Interestingly CXCR3 ligands have been postulated to be antagonists for CCR3 [15], and the expression of both sets of chemokines may reflect a high degree of dysregulation during HPIs and the recruitment of multiple immune cell types that may not normally co-localize during a controlled infection.",

Likewise surfactant-associated protein A1 (SFTPA1) and surfactant-associated protein D (SFTPD) maintain pulmonary structure but have also been found to inhibit infectivity by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated [17,18]. The analog signature contained a similar set of genes but expressed at lower levels in HPIs compared to LPIs rather than to mock infections. Among these genes were several members of the secretoglobin family including SCGB1A1, SCGB3A1, and SCGB3A3. Interestingly many secretoglobins are expressed specifically in the lung epithelium and may contribute to lung repair following damage [19,20].

For meta-analysis based on direct comparison of intensities, two-channel data were separated into individual channels, and inter-array normalization was performed using NeONORM [23]. Additional data preparation involved converting probe- to gene-level data. Measurements for probes mapping to multiple genes were duplicated for each gene, and probes mapping to the same gene were averaged. RefSeq IDs were chosen as the common gene identifier. Probes not mapping to RefSeq IDs were excluded. Biological and technical replicates were averaged for the intensity-based approaches. Log-ratio measurements from all studies were combined resulting in measurements for 27,567 genes by 397 biological conditions. All data-handling tasks were performed using custom scripts in Perl.",

Our implementation was derived from MADAM (Meta-Analysis Data Aggregation Methods), a toolbox for the R statistical language [25]. Statistical tests were performed on a per-gene basis for all arrays associated with a given biological condition. Specifically log-ratio measurements for each array were re-normalized by dividing by the standard deviation of the array, and one-sided t-tests were used to identify genes up- and down-regulated relative to mock infection, i.e., for the null hypotheses H0: log2 (infected/mock) \u2264 0 and H0: log2 (infected/mock) \u2265 0, respectively. p-values for each directionality (up- or down-regulation) and pathogenicity (HPI or LPI) were combined according to Fisher's summary statistic S = -2 \u2211 log p [26]. The significance of S was determined by a permutation test whereby p-values were shuffled 1000 times among biological conditions, S was re-derived each time, and the resulting S values constituted the null distribution. An FDR-corrected p-value of 0.05 was used as a threshold for significance. Genes that were found to be both up- and down-regulated for a given pathogenicity (HPI or LPI) were excluded from further analysis. The signature comprised genes found to be oppositely regulated in HPI and LPI.",
