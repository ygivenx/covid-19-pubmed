This started a two-year process which was due to conclude with the UK\u2019s exit on 29 March 2019, which at the time of writing has been extended until October 2019. This process is known as \u201cBrexit\u201d. Optimal preparedness for, and response to, international imported health threats requires surveillance, with robust early warning and response mechanisms which are shared across nations. In the context of Brexit, there are concerns about the maintenance of the current high degree of commitment to those systems and policies within the EU which have been firmly established and are multi-lateral in nature and which act to prevent, detect and manage serious infectious health threats spreading to Ireland and all EU states from elsewhere.",

The nature of any possible future land frontier between the EU and the UK in Northern Ireland has not been fully clarified, and it is a high priority for Ireland that any U.K. withdrawal from the EU would be negotiated to retain a porous non-structural border and to avoid a hard, structural border [4]. The draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit of July 2018 refers to the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland on a permanent footing. The European Commission [5] acknowledges that different arrangements exist under the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland compared to other EU countries.",
