Cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) acts like a potent PAMP, sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). cGAS detects cytoplasmic dsDNA and catalyzes the synthesis of GMP-AMP cyclic dinucleotide (cGAMP) (1, 2). cGAMP acts as a second messenger and binds to the stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), which traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is recruited and phosphorylated. This event allows the recruitment of IRF3 that is subsequently phosphorylated by TBK1 and then translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor for type I IFN-\u03b2 gene expression (2\u20134).",

In contrast, acute ASF in domestic pigs or the European wild boar is characterized by hemorrhages in lymph nodes and internal organs and high temperatures, resulting in the death of the animal in about 7 to 10 days. Different strains of the virus exhibit different virulence, ranging from peracute to acute to subclinical and chronic forms of the disease (reviewed in reference 19). The fact that ASFV strains display different virulence patterns, suggests a distinctive activation of the immune system (reviewed in reference 20), resulting in a complex scenario of virus-host interactions (21\u201323) and type I IFN cascade (24).",

These mechanisms involve the inhibition of (i) cGAS-dependent viral DNA sensing, (ii) cGAMP-mediated phosphorylation of STING, (iii) STING trafficking, and (iv) TBK1/IRF3 activation. The inhibition and control of IFN-\u03b2 synthesis, one of the most important antiviral immune factors, is most likely an essential feature for the virulent ASFV Armenia/07 strain.

            "text": "ASFV strains can either cause chronic, subclinical, or fatal, acute ASF disease. In order to study whether differences in ASFV virulence are related to differences in the activation of the innate immune response, we analyzed the level of IFN-\u03b2 produced by porcine alveolar macrophages infected either with NH/P68 (attenuated) or with Armenia/07 (virulent) ASFV strains. For this purpose, a time course experiment in macrophages at 0, 4, 8, and 16 h postinfection (hpi) was performed. Figure 1A shows a higher production of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in cells infected with NH/P68 compared to those infected with Armenia/07, starting at 4 hpi with a maximum at 16 hpi, a time point where IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was very low in cells infected with Armenia/07. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in cells infected with NH/P68 from 4 to 16 hpi, indicating that cellular signaling leading to IFN-\u03b2 transcription is activated during the course of the infection with the attenuated virus. Next, the amount of IFN-\u03b2 secreted during attenuated versus virulent infections was determined. Supernatants from either NH/P68- or Armenia/07-infected macrophages were collected, and IFN-\u03b2 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 1B). The results show a strong decrease of secreted IFN-\u03b2 at 16 hpi, after an initial increase at 8 hpi, during the infection with the virulent strain, whereas in NH/P68-infected macrophages the amount of IFN-\u03b2 increases over time. These data correlate well with the results obtained regarding IFN-\u03b2 mRNA production (Fig. 1A). This indicates that virulent ASFV shuts down the IFN-\u03b2 synthesis pathway several hours after infection (Fig. 1A), although IFN-\u03b2 mRNA production is significantly above the control level at 4 hpi. This effect also translates to IFN-\u03b2 cytokine production, which initially increases and is totally abolished at 16 hpi, when macrophages are infected with virulent ASFV (Fig. 1B).",

In order to analyze the phosphorylation status and cellular localization of IRF3 during attenuated versus virulent ASFV infections, we used a specific antibody to detect p-IRF3 in different subcellular locations of the cell. To achieve this, mock-infected, NH/P68-infected, or Armenia/07-infected macrophages were fractionated after 8 hpi, a time point when both STING and IRF3 were found to be phosphorylated by NH/P68 but not by Armenia/07 (Fig. 2B and C). Cytoplasmic (S2) and nuclear (P1) fractions were obtained from the respective whole-cell extracts (WCE). Next, the P1 fraction was further separated into nuclear soluble fraction (S3) and chromatin fraction (P3) (Fig. 4A). We used specific markers for each cell fraction to confirm the accuracy of the fractionating procedure: actin for the soluble fraction, histone 3 (H3) for the soluble nuclear fraction, and \u03b21-laminin for the chromatin fraction.",

This result also shows that the viral process to inhibit STING/TBK1 activation can be overcome by cGAMP, suggesting that cGAMP is a critical component of the activation pathway.

Interestingly, the inhibition of STING phosphorylation induced by Armenia/07 (Fig. 2C and 5) was reversed by exogenous cGAMP, confirming that Armenia/07 inhibits STING phosphorylation by a mechanism that involves cGAMP. To assess whether these events are dependent on viral DNA replication, cells were treated with 40 \u03bcg/ml of AraC. There was no difference whether the cells were treated or not with AraC, suggesting that both the STING blockage by Armenia/07 and the rescue by cGAMP are mechanisms independent of viral replication, suggesting in turn that very early or early viral factors are involved.",

In contrast, cells infected with Armenia/07 present a more diffuse STING distribution pattern throughout the cytoplasm, similar to that found in mock-infected cells. The latter results indicate a nonactivation status of STING and confirms the small amount of p-STING we found during Armenia/07 infection (Fig. 2C). Both Armenia/07 and NH/P68 infections were confirmed by the presence of viral factories, which are stained by DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole) as small DNA accumulations next to the cell nucleus (arrowheads). We quantified STING distribution pattern in infected cells, which were identified by the presence of viral factories. This analysis revealed that in more than 80% of NH/P68-infected cells STING is localized in punctuated perinuclear microsome structures (Fig. 7B).

To do this, we used either NH/P68 or Armenia/07 at an MOI of 2 to infect porcine alveolar macrophages, together with cGAMP-treated macrophages as a positive control of STING activation; the cells were then processed for immunofluorescence, and specific antibodies against STING and against the AP1 complex (marker for TGN [16, 35]) were applied. As shown in Fig. 8 (central panels), STING colocalizes with AP1 (arrows) in both NH/P68- and Armenia/07-infected cells after 1 h of infection. A similar colocalization pattern between STING and AP1 was found in cGAMP-treated macrophages (Fig. 8). This indicates that both attenuated and virulent ASFV strains \u201cactivate\u201d STING trafficking very early after infection. By 6 hpi, STING accumulates in punctuated perinuclear structures in cells infected with NH/P68 but not with Armenia/07 (see Fig. 8, lower panels). Furthermore, STING partially colocalizes with AP1 in cytoplasmic structures outside from perinuclear structures in NH/P68-infected cells. Importantly, this colocalization pattern was not detected in cells infected with Armenia/07 (Fig. 8, lower panels). AP1 is located mainly around the ASFV viral factories (arrowhead) in both Armenia/07- and NH/P68-infected cells, a localization that was previously described (16).",

Our results demonstrate that whereas Armenia/07 inhibits the synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 (and its dependent genes IFIT-1 and CXCL10) by inhibiting IRF3 activation and STING phosphorylation, NH/P68 does not. Infection of porcine alveolar macrophages with NH/P68 results in (i) the induction of significant levels of IFN-\u03b2, (ii) phosphorylation of STING, (iii) traffic of STING through the Golgi to perinuclear punctuated structures, and (iv) localization of IRF3 to the nuclear soluble fraction and binding to chromatin. Furthermore, inhibition of cGAS by the specific inhibitor Ru521 (30) impairs NH/P68-induced STING phosphorylation, suggesting that cGAS is the main DNA sensor activating the STING cascade by the attenuated ASFV NH/P68 isolate. In contrast, cGAMP-induced phosphorylation of STING was prevented by infection of cells with Armenia/07. Also, STING trafficking to perinuclear punctuated structures was severely impaired in Armenia/07-infected cells, indicating that the virulent ASFV strain prevents the activation and trafficking of STING.",

Similar observations were made in previous reports describing the inhibition of IFN-\u03b1 production during virulent ASFV strain infection (39, 40). In contrast, Portugal et al. reported recently that IFN-\u03b1 inhibition was exerted by both virulent and attenuated ASFV strains (41). Similarly, when IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 were analyzed in sera from animals infected with virulent ASFV strains (42, 43), induction of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 was observed, which was attributed to cytokine production by non-ASFV-susceptible cells. Since there are most likely several pathways and virulence factors involved in ASFV virulence, this result is not surprising.",

Importantly, early after infection the cGAS-STING pathway was induced by both attenuated and virulent ASFV, but later on, was effectively inhibited only by virulent Armenia/07. Our data reveal a clear correlation between ASFV virulence and virus ability to inhibit the cGAS-STING pathway. Similar results have been obtained with vaccinia virus, an ASFV-related, dsDNA cytoplasmic virus. The attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) induces IFN-\u03b2 in infected cells via the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway (46), while virulent vaccinia strains prevent cGAS-STING activation and hence IFN-\u03b2 production in infected cells (47). Our results, therefore, reinforce the idea that ASFV virulence versus attenuation, two concepts controversially discussed in the ASFV field, may be phenomena associated with the control of the cGAS-STING pathway.",

Using the viral DNA replication inhibitor AraC, we showed that STING phosphorylation is impaired by Armenia/07 in the presence of AraC, thus involving events happening before viral DNA replication. In contrast, STING phosphorylation is triggered as early as 1 h after NH/P68 infection and leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3, a transcription factor regulating IFN-\u03b2 synthesis (31). The different time points at which IRF3 is phosphorylated during attenuated versus virulent strains suggest that a faster transition between activated STING and phosphorylated IRF3 occurs during virulent strain infection. Phosphorylated IRF3 then translocates to the nucleus and binds to the chromatin fraction to induce IFN-\u03b2 production. The latter happens during NH/P68 infection, whereas during Armenia/07 infection, IRF3 was not phosphorylated and consequently absent from the nuclear and chromatin fractions of the infected cells. Interestingly, it has been recently reported (48) that STING phosphorylation is required to further activate IRF3.",

Importantly, we have been able to identify cGAS as the main DNA sensor involved in STING activation upon ASFV infection in porcine alveolar macrophages. In fact, we found that a specific inhibitor of cGAS, Ru521 (30), blocked the activation of STING produced by NH/P68 infection. However, we cannot exclude the involvement of other sensors such as IFI16 or sensors triggered in the absence of active cGAS (61, 62).",

It has been described that various viruses can act at different levels to counteract the IFN-\u03b2 activation pathway (45).

Significantly, STING appears in these microsomes in most of the NH/P68-infected cells at 6 hpi, whereas at that time postinfection with Armenia/07, STING is mainly found throughout the cytoplasm. Transit of STING through the Golgi, prior to its translocation into microsomes, has been shown to be a key event for STING activation, since STING undergoes posttranslational modifications and interaction with molecules such as TBK1 (34, 64). Therefore, to further assess the virulence mechanism of ASFV, we investigated whether the transit of STING through the Golgi is blocked during Armenia/07 infection, as reported for other viruses such as HSV-1 or human cytomegalovirus (57, 65). At very early times after both NH/P68 and Armenia/07 infection, STING traffics through the TGN in a similar manner than in cGAMP-treated cells, while at 6 hpi this traffic is prevented in Armenia/07-infected cells but not in NH/P68-infected cells, thus impairing the ability of STING to reach microsomes. These results suggest that at very early times of infection, STING is activated in both NH/P68 and in Armenia/07 infected cells, but several hours later, the virulent ASFV strain is able to block activation of STING.",

From the results presented here, possible viral gene candidates could be very early genes, such as products of the so-called multigene families (66). In this regard, very recently, studies in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, have postulated that the transfected DP96R gene of the Chinese virulent strain 2018/1 could have a role in the control of the cGAS-STING pathway (24). However, these results should be discussed cautiously, since (i) HEK cells are not susceptible to ASFV infection and (ii) these studies have not been performed in the context of an active ASFV infection. In addition, the DP96R gene is present and identical in both attenuated and virulent strains of the same genotype, such as NH/P68 and Ba71 (both genotype I) and has 98% identity between attenuated and virulent strains of different genotypes, such as NH/P68 (genotype I) and Armenia/07 (genotype II). Therefore, the experiments performed above with DP96R most likely do not explain the differences in the cGAS-STING pathway modulation exerted by virulent and attenuated ASFV strains.",

(A) Porcine alveolar macrophages were mock infected or infected with NH/P68 or Armenia/07 strain (2 PFU/cell) or treated with cGAMP (20 \u03bcg/ml). At 1 and 6 hpi or 1 h after cGAMP treatment, the cells were fixed and stained with DAPI (blue), anti-STING (green), and anti-AP1 (red) antibodies and examined by using a confocal microscope. Cells where STING exhibit a punctuate pattern are highlighted (arrows). (B and C) Quantification of fraction of STING overlapping AP1 (Mander\u2019s coefficient) for each condition (B) and only for cells with a STING punctuated pattern (arrows) at 1 hpi and cGAMP-treated cells (C). The data are means \u00b1 the SD (n = 50). Data were statistically analyzed by using a Student t test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).",
