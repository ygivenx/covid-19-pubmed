This interaction induces a structural rearrangement in Env, exposing conserved regions within the gp120 subunit, thereby enabling binding to an appropriate co-receptor, primarily the chemokine receptors CXCR4 or CCR5\n[12,13]. Engagement of gp120 to the co-receptor triggers conformational changes in the gp41 subunit, exposing its hydrophobic amino-terminal fusion peptide which inserts into the host cell membrane, followed by the formation of the six helix bundle (trimer-of-hairpin) structure that enables fusion of the virus and cell membranes and the subsequent release of the viral capsid into the cytosol (reviewed in\n[12,14].",

At present, there is still ambiguity regarding which enzyme(s) mediate the disulfide bond rearrangements. The majority of studies investigating the effects of disulfide isomerase/reductase inhibitors\n[16-20,22], specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (Ab) directed against these enzymes\n[16,18,20], as well as fluorescent microscopy and Western blot analysis of gp120 interactions and/or reduction of disulfide bonds\n[20,23,24], imply that PDI is the key enzyme involved in the HIV-1 entry process. However, it has also been reported\n[25] that Trx plays a major role during HIV-1 Env induced fusion, while PDI expression and/or function has a negligible effect. In yet another study\n[26], it was shown that another member of the Trx superfamily, glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1), can reduce disulfide bonds in both CD4 and gp120, and its inhibition results in reduced HIV-1 infection.",

R5 strains of HIV-1 are primarily involved in virus transmission; they predominate during the early and asymptomatic stages of infection, and are typically present throughout the symptomatic phase of HIV disease (reviewed in\n[27]). For these reasons, we conducted a comprehensive study using a panel of distinct assays to focus extensively on the significance of thiol/disulfide exchange during entry of several R5-tropic HIV-1 strains, including those that were minimally passaged, into their natural targets \u2013 primary human macrophages and CD4+ lymphocytes. In addition, we determined the effects of disulfide reductase/isomerase inhibitors on human macrophage infection with HIV-192UG024, one of the few primary X4-tropic strains capable of infecting these cells\n[28]. Our results provide critical new information on the role of disulfide isomerases in HIV infection and further support previous observations that thiol/disulfide exchange is required for HIV-1 entry. More interestingly, our data reveal cell-type specificity with respect to the enzymes involved in this process.",

After a brief pre-incubation (~1 h), cells were infected in the presence of DTNB for 2.5 h, followed by an extensive washout of the reagent. About 48 h later, cells were lysed, and Luc activity was measured and expressed in relative light units (RLU). In HOS CD4+/CCR5+ cells, DTNB exposure potently reduced infection by HIV-1JR-FL or HIV-1AD8 Env-pseudotyped virions (Figure\n1A) without impairing cell viability (trypan blue exclusion test). DTNB also caused a similar dose-dependent suppression of HIV-1JR-FL Env-pseudotyped virion infection of the JC53 CD4+/CCR5+ cell line, as well as primary macrophages and PBMCs (Figure\n1B,C,D), without significantly altering the cell surface expression of CD4 or chemokine co-receptors (data not shown). DTNB incubation also has no effect on Luc activity in cells directly electroporated with the pNL4-3 e-R+ Luc plasmid used to generate the reporter gene-encoding HIV-1 Env pseudotyped virus particles (data not shown), consistent with previous observations that DTNB is nearly plasma membrane impermeable\n[29,30].",

Given that DTNB could potentially interfere with multiple cell surface proteins containing sulphydryl groups, although unlikely, it was still possible that the effect of DTNB on HIV-1 replication could be nonspecific. For this reason, we sought to examine the effect of DTNB solely on virus entry by employing \u03b2-lactamase (BlaM)-containing virions\n[32,33] prior to testing its effect on spreading HIV-1 infection in vitro. Negative controls prepared for DTNB treated and untreated cells confirmed that DTNB had no detrimental effects on loading of the cells with the fluorescent dye, CCF2/AM, and did not influence the background non-specific cell fluorescence (Figure\n2A, B, upper graphs). In addition, cells electroporated with pMM310 (pcDNA3.1(Zeo)-Vpr-BlaM), incubated in 5 mM DTNB and subsequently loaded with the fluorescent dye CCF2/AM showed no significant difference in the number of blue cells, compared to cells incubated in DMEM only (data not shown), indicating that DTNB did not affect the BlaM enzymatic activity. Using HIV-1AD8 BlaM containing virus particles, we established that DTNB significantly inhibited fusion of HIV-1AD8 BlaM-containing virions with both the JC53 CD4+/CCR5+ cell line (Figure\n2A) and primary human PBMCs (Figure\n2B), as well as MDMs (Figure\n2C), indicating that its effect occurs predominantly at the level of virus entry and further supporting the role for thiol/disulfide exchange in HIV-1 Env during infection.",

To identify the disulfide reductases/isomerases involved in HIV-1 infection of MDM and serving as potential targets for DTNB, the effects of specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PDI and/or Trx, two enzymes previously implicated in HIV-1 Env disulfude bond rearrangements\n[16-20] were evaluated. The mAbs were applied before and during virus adsorption/fusion; HIV-1 infection was monitored by measuring RT activity at various time points throughout the course of infection. Anti-PDI or anti-Trx mAbs significantly inhibited MDM infection by all three HIV-1 strains tested. However, data obtained from multiple experiments performed with HIV-1ADA established that the anti-Trx mAb was more efficient in reducing RT values and delaying the time of peak RT activity during infection (Figure\n3D,E and data not shown), suggesting that Trx may play a greater role in disulfide bond rearrangement in HIV-1 R5 isolates.",

We found that anti-PDI mAbs inhibited the infection of PM-1 cells by R5 HIV-1JR-FL Env pseudotyped Luc reporter gene virus particles in a dose dependent manner (Figure\n4A). In contrast, the anti-Trx mAbs had no effect on the latter infection, even when used at a maximum concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml. Similar results were obtained when anti-PDI and/or anti-Trx treated PM-1 cells were infected with HIV-1NL4-3 Env pseudotyped virions (data not shown). Furthermore, anti-PDI mAb, but not anti-Trx mAb, significantly reduced the RT values and delayed the peak RT activity when PM-1 cells were infected with the R5 laboratory-adapted strain, HIV-1ADA, or the X4 strain, HIV-1LAV (Figure\n4B,C). Although affinity values for these mAbs could not be obtained from their commercial sources, we established Kd values for the anti-PDI and the anti-Trx mAbs of 15 nM and 8 nM, respectively using surface plasmon resonance (data not shown). The affinities of the two mAbs, as well as the length of incubation (0.5 -1 h pre-incubation plus an additional 4 h during virus adsorption/infection), suggest comparable binding of the two mAbs to their relevant targets, especially when used at the highest concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml (~330nM IgG).",

Primary MDM were evaluated for the effects of anti-PDI or anti-Trx mAbs on HIV-1JR-FL Env-pseudotyped virus infection using the same experimental system. In contrast to primary human PBLs, the anti-Trx mAb was more effective at inhibiting HIV-1 infection of primary MDM when present during the virus adsorption and entry period. An opposite trend and statistically significant differences (P\u22640.01) were established between the anti-PDI and anti-Trx treated cells for the PBL and MDM systems, respectively (Figure\n5). Given that the mean Luc activity of the nonspecific IgG treated cells was assumed to be 100%, it was not possible to directly evaluate the statistical significance (P values) of the differences between the control and anti-PDI or control and anti-Trx treated cells in Figure\n5. However, the differences between the control and anti-PDI treated PBL and between the control and anti-Trx treated MDM were found to be statistically significant for all donors tested when primary data (RLU) were used to calculate the relevant P values (P\u22640.05, not shown).",

The same mAb clones used to inhibit HIV-1 infection were directly conjugated to different fluorescent dyes (anti-PDI- DyLight 488 and anti-Trx-APC), and used for Flow Cytometry analysis. Although PDI and Trx are predominantly found as intracellular proteins, it is well-documented that these molecules can also be secreted and associate with the plasma membrane\n[34-36]. Given that cell surface PDI and Trx molecules are peripheral plasma membrane proteins, the cells prepared for Flow Cytometry analysis of cell surface PDI and Trx were washed with DPBS, fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde prior to labeling to prevent dissociation from the cell surface and then treated with NH4Cl to quench the reactive aldehyde groups before incubation with the specific mAbs as described in Methods. In addition to the anti-PDI and anti-Trx mAbs, PBLs were also incubated with a specific anti-CD4 mAb, directly labeled with the fluorescent marker, Pacific blue, and only those cells that stained positive for CD4 were further analyzed for their PDI and Trx cell surface levels. We found that PM-1 cells and primary MDM expressed both PDI and Trx on their surface (Figure\n6A,B). Intriguingly, in contrast to PDI which was present to comparable levels on both unstimulated and PHA-activated CD4+ T cells, Trx expression was very low on unstimulated CD4+ lymphocytes, but increased significantly after PHA treatment (Figure\n6C). Taken together our findings strongly suggest that the cell type specific effects of anti-PDI and anti-Trx mAbs observed in PM-1 cells, primary MDM, and PHA activated PBLs cannot be attributed to the absence of any enzyme on the plasma membrane of the various cells that have been tested.",

The mature HIV-1 Env is expressed as a trimer of gp120-gp41 heterodimers on the surface of virions and/or infected cells. HIV-1 gp120 consists of five variable domains (V1-V5) interconnected by five more conserved regions (C1-C5), delineated by nine intra-chain disulfide bonds\n[37,38]. The gp41 ectodomain, in addition to its hydrophobic N-terminus, encompasses two hydrophobic regions with a characteristic coiled-coil structure, designated as heptad repeats 1 and 2, that are connected by a linker sequence forming a conserved disulfide bond\n[12,39,40]. Although there have been published reports from several independent studies on this topic, the number, location and timing of the HIV-1 Env disulfide bond modifications during virus entry are still not completely elucidated. The majority of disulfide bonds in gp120, delineating or inside domains V1/V2 (Cys126-Cys196; Cys119-Cys205; Cys131-Cys157), V3 (Cys296-Cys331), V4 (Cys385-Cys418), C1 (Cys54-Cys74), C2 (Cys218-Cys247) and C4 (Cys378-Cys445), as well as the disulfide bond in gp41, have all been implicated as potential targets for reduction and/or isomerization\n[11,19,41-43]. There has been some ambiguity with respect to when the disulfide bond rearrangements in gp120 take place: immediately following CD4-gp120 binding\n[19,20] or after the interaction of gp120 with CD4 and the relevant coreceptor\n[17,44]. It is reasonable to suggest that some of the disulfide bonds could be modified right after CD4 binding, if such rearrangements facilitate the subsequent coreceptor association while others, such as the disulfide bond straddling the V3 loop and critical for the integrity of the coreceptor binding site\n[15,45], may undergo modification after the gp120-CD4-coreceptor complex is formed.",

At present, there is no consensus regarding the particular disulfide reductases/isomerases that may be required for HIV-1 infection. Experimental data from various studies have confirmed the PDI mediated disulfide bond rearrangements in both gp120\n[11,20,23,24] and CD4\n[26], as well as the suppression of HIV-1 infection by PDI inhibitors\n[16-20]. However, Trx has also been shown to induce redox changes in gp120\n[25,42] and CD4\n[25,46] and Ou et al.,\n[25] found that Trx, not PDI, played a major role in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. Interestingly, it was recently reported\n[43] that, despite certain quantitative differences, PDI and Trx generally target the same disulfide bonds within gp120. Auwerx et al.,\n[26] established that another oxidoreductase, Grx1, in addition to PDI, caused a disulfide bond reduction in gp120 and CD4 and also observed a significant (~50%), but incomplete, inhibition of HIV-1RW009 infection by polyclonal anti-Grx1 Abs.",

            "text": "Given that there have been only a few reports on the effects of disulfide reductase/isomerase inhibitors on HIV-1 infection of primary human cells\n[16,19,26], our current study set out to provide a comprehensive investigation of the role of thiol/disulfide exchange in HIV-1 infection using primary human PBMCs, PBLs and MDMs. Using single cycle as well as multi-round replication assays, we initially tested the effects of the non-specific disulfide isomerase/reductase inhibitor, DTNB, employing predominantly R5 strains. In contrast to other viruses, such as hantaviruses\n[30] where surface glycoproteins express free thiol groups, it is unlikely that DTNB will interact directly with the HIV-1 Env, since those cysteines are interlinked via disulfide bonds. However, if reductase activity is not completely suppressed during the virus-cell fusion process, especially when lower DTNB concentrations are applied, potential alkylation by DTNB of the newly generated thiol groups may contribute to its inhibitory activity. We established that DTNB potently reduced HIV-1 entry and infection in primary cells to levels comparable to the observed inhibition in cell lines (Figure\n1 and\n2). DTNB also inhibited MDM infection by all strains tested, including the primary, minimally passaged R5 strain BCF03 and X4 strain UG024. Attempts to identify the particular disulfide reductases/isomerases involved in HIV-1 entry by applying specific mAbs, unexpectedly revealed a clearly distinguished specificity among the various cell types tested (Figure\n4 and\n5). In MDM, anti-Trx mAbs proved to be more potent than the anti-PDI mAbs in suppressing HIV-1 entry and infection. In contrast, these same anti-Trx mAbs had negligible effects on the PM-1 T cell line and primary PBLs, while the anti-PDI mAbs significantly reduced HIV-1 infection in these cells (Figure\n3,\n4 and\n5). Intriguingly, both PDI and Trx were present on the plasma membrane of all cell types tested (Figure\n6). Although it appeared that MDMs displayed higher levels of Trx than PDI on their surface, it is unlikely that this fact alone could account for the differences in the HIV-1 inhibitory activities of the anti-Trx and anti-PDI mAbs. In support of this notion, PM-1 cells and PHA stimulated PBLs expressed comparable levels of Trx and PDI on their surface, while anti-PDI and anti-Trx mAbs clearly exerted distinct patterns on HIV-1 infection when compared to each other or to their effects on primary human MDM (Figure\n4 and\n5). It was previously shown that gp120, CD4, CXCR4 and PDI co-localize on the cell surface\n[20] and we speculated that a preferential temporal association of gp120, CD4 and the relevant corecepor with either PDI or Trx might be the reason for the observed cell-type specific oxidoreductase involvement in HIV-1 entry. Molecular docking analysis revealed that PDI may interact with the third immunoglobulin-like (D3) region of CD4\n[10]. D3 contains one of the glycosylation sites in human CD4\n[48] and it is conceivable that subtle differences in CD4 glycosylation may result in its preferential interaction with PDI in some cell types, but not in others. CD4 is also known to interact with the tyrosine kinase p56lck in PBLs and T cell lines, but not in monocytes and MDM\n[49], which may also influence its behavior on the cell surface in a cell-type dependent manner. CCR5 and CXCR4 heterogeneity\n[50], as well as their preferential cell type dependent interactions with CD4\n[45], may also be contributing factors to the cell-type specific disulfide reductase/isomerase involvement in HIV-1 entry. Alternatively, or in combination with the parameters already discussed, there may be differences in the way T lymphocytes/T cell lines and macrophages regulate the balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of PDI and/or Trx on their surface, which in turn may favor the preferential involvement of one of these enzymes during HIV-1 entry. Cell surface molecules other than CD4 and CCR5 may also interact with PDI or Trx and influence their redox status and/or availability during HIV-1 entry. It was recently reported\n[51] that galectin-9 binds to and increases the retention of PDI on the cell surface, thus facilitating Th2 lymphocyte migration and HIV-1 infection most likely through modulation of the cell surface redox environment.",

The redox imbalance is a hallmark of HIV-1 infection, resulting in a complex chain of events at intra- and extracellular levels that influence HIV-1 replication (reviewed in\n[52,53]). The finding that freshly isolated PBLs, in contrast to PHA-stimulated cells, express ample amounts of PDI yet express relatively low levels of Trx on their surface, may provide insights regarding the predominant utilization of PDI by CD4+ lymphocytes, the entry of HIV-1 in resting T cells, and the establishment of virus reservoirs. Given that MDM utilize predominantly Trx during HIV-1 entry (Figures\n3D,E and\n5), the observed elevation of plasma Trx during chronic stages of HIV disease\n[54,55] may enhance macrophage infection and help sustain high viremia even when very low levels of CD4+ T-cells exist. In this regard, plasma Trx levels showed a significant inverse correlation with the survival rate of HIV-1-infected patients having a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells/\u03bcL\n[55].",

After transfection, the cells were washed extensively with DMEM and further incubated for 24\u201348 h. The resulting supernatants were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 rpm, filtered through low protein binding 45 \u03bcM syringe filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and used immediately or kept at 4\u00b0C for up to 48 h. CD4/coreceptor positive cells were prepared in 96 (50x103 cells/well) or 48 well (1.5x105 cells/well) plates and infected with 25 or 50 \u03bcl virus suspension per well, respectively. No DEAE-Dextran or polybrene were used to facilitate fusion. DTNB, anti-PDI or anti-Trx mAbs (in serum free DMEM) were applied as indicated in the figure legends. After the 2.5 h period for virus infection (in a serum free medium), the cells were extensively washed and then incubated for 48 h (in medium supplemented with 10% FBS) prior to lysis with 0.5% Triton-100 in PBS (Luc reporter gene studies). A 50 \u03bcl aliquot of the resulting lysate was assayed for Luc activity using the appropriate substrate (Promega, Madison, WI). To exclude the possibility of DTNB having an effect on Luc expression at a post-entry level, HOS cells were electroporated with the pNL4-3 e-R+ plasmid, incubated for 3.5 h on the next day in concentrations of DTNB used in the virus infection experiments and lysed and tested for Luc activity 48 h later. The statistical analysis of the experiments employing HIV-1 Env pseudotyped, Luc reporter gene encoding virus particles was performed using the GraphPad Prism scientific software (t-test).",

The extent of CCF2/AM cleavage by the virus-introduced intracellular BlaM, detected by the change in dye emission from the green to the blue spectrum, was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence using Laser Scanning Cytometer (CompuCyte, Cambridge, MA) or BD LSR II Cell Analyzer generating light at 407 nm and equipped with HQ460/30 and HQ530/20 filters for detection of the blue and green emission, respectively. Individual negative controls (mock infection) were prepared for both medium- or DTNB-treated cells to define more precisely the region of BlaM positive cells in the Laser Scanning or Flow Cytometry experiments. To exclude the possibility of DTNB having an effect on BlaM activity, HOS and/or JC53 cells were electroporated with the parental (pCDNA3.1) or the Vpr-BlaM encoding plasmid, incubated for 3.5 h on the next day in 5 mM DTNB, washed (x2), loaded with fluorescent dye CCF2/AM and analyzed by Flow Cytometry as described for the virus entry experiments.",
