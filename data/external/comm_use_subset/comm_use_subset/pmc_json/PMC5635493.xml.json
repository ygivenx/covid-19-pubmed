            "text": "Respiratory tract infections (RTI) place a significant burden on health systems globally, particularly during the annual respiratory season epidemics [1]. Diagnostic tests for respiratory pathogens (RP) are usually laboratory\u2013based with an inherent delay in time to result relating to specimen in transit to the laboratory and laboratory testing schedules, for example once a day, and/or not performed on weekends and holidays. For this reason or due to the nature of the test (culture, serology or batch molecular testing) results are rarely available to the clinician when the patient is first assessed. Consequently, though respiratory viruses are frequently isolated in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) [2] and are reported to be responsible for 12.8% of CAP cases admitted to UK hospitals [3], the decision to manage as a viral RTI or treat for bacterial infection including Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae (\u2018atypical bacteria\u2019) is based upon the clinical scenario and severity criteria such as the CURB-65 score. Thus a proportion of infections will be inappropriately managed with antibiotics or the result may arrive too late for influenza treatment to be effective [4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that antimicrobial resistance threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections [5]. The Centre for Evidence Based Medicine highlights the considerable number of new diagnostic technologies in development to underpin the rational prescribing of antibiotics [6], which extends to antivirals.",

            "text": "Point of care (POC) tests eliminate the need for specimen transportation to the testing laboratory and can be performed on demand by ward staff. By providing faster results, POC tests may influence early treatment decisions such as hospital admission and allow earlier discharge, targeted antimicrobial prescriptions and better antimicrobial stewardship. POC testing should also reduce cross-transmission and subsequent nosocomial outbreaks related to viral RTI cases that are undiagnosed and patients not placed in appropriate isolation. However, current POC tests for respiratory viruses are generally antigen detection tests, usually only detect influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and their sensitivity can be suboptimal [7, 8]. The BioFire FilmArray\u00ae respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, a bioMerieux Company) detects 14 respiratory viruses: influenza virus types A and B (with influenza A subtyping), adenovirus, coronaviruses HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134 and RSV and 3 bacteria: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis. FilmArray\u00ae lends itself to POC testing as it is a small, desktop, fully-automated nested multiplex PCR in an enclosed disposable pouch requiring only 2 min of hands-on time with results available in about 1 hour [9]. Though more expensive than single or low multiplex laboratory or POC tests, clinical outcomes such as a reduced length of stay and reduction in inappropriate antimicrobial usage resulting from the rapid and extended panel may offset test costs. Thus understanding FilmArray\u00ae\u2018s clinical utility as a POC test early in a patient\u2019s admission is important.",

The FilmArray\u00ae RP panel is relatively expensive (\u00a389\u2013\u00a3133 for the consumables and \u00a328, 000-\u00a333,000 for the capital purchase of the system depending upon the country) compared to currently employed routine tests, (\u00a350 per test for our standard laboratory method). However the average cost for managing pneumonia in the community is estimated at \u00a3100 per episode compared with \u00a31700\u20135100 for hospitalised patients in the UK [14] and $8000 in the US [15]. Thus if a FilmArray\u00ae POC result allows earlier discharge, the consequent financial savings from the shorter hospital stay may offset the extra test costs and prove cost-beneficial, hence our choice of primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were antimicrobial prescription/s (antibiotics: any versus none, duration, time to prescription within the first 72 h of the patient\u2019s stay and prescribing decisions within 24 h after the the diagnostic results under investigation: start, stop, de-escalation, escalation and continued use, as assessed by the Chief Investigator), readmission rates and all-cause mortality (both within 30 days of the test) and length of study-ward stay (i.e. removing the length of stay on subsequent wards to which the patient was transferred, where relevant). Escalation was defined as the addition of an antibiotic/s to the existing antibiotic therapy or the substitution of the current agent with a broader agent. De-escalation was the cessation of \u22651 antibiotic when >1 antibiotic was prescribed or the substitution with a narrower agent. We collected these data prospectively and retrospectively from the electronic patient record (EPR) and the electronic patient medicines administration system (EPMA). In some cases, enrolment of the patient into the hospital administrative system occurred after examination and initiation of antibiotic therapy by the physician on the ward or in the ED. Therefore, a negative time to antibiotic administration on the ward was corrected to zero hours to antibiotics. We defined the turn-around time (TAT) of the tests as the time between hospital admission and the time of the result on the FilmArray\u00ae system (intervention) or the time of the result on the EPR (control).",

However, though the POC test was 1 day faster than laboratory-based testing, the results were available later than anticipated. This was not due to testing performance of FilmArray\u00ae, which took only 65 min but related to a delay in the processing of the specimen by the clinical staff on the ward. Sixty-eight percent of POC tests were performed by study investigators reflecting the fact that the study protocol was not initiated by clinical staff as soon as the patient was admitted to the study ward in many cases. Instead testing was delayed until the study investigators visiting the study wards initiated the study protocol. This resulted in a significant delay in time to results. This is in contrast to a trial of MRSA POC screening by our AMU ward staff that had a TAT from admission of 3.7 h [20]. MRSA testing is mandatory and most patients were eligible for inclusion. The delay in the present study may be related to screening for more complex eligibility criteria than the MRSA study and an additional reliance on study investigators present on the ward to perform the test. If this is the case, the TAT would be faster if FilmArray\u00ae was embedded as a routine, diagnostic POC test. When ward staff did perform the test, they were from all grades and they performed it without incident. Others report a TAT of 2.3 h for FilmArray\u00ae POC testing, though the TAT was from the time of decision to test to the time of result and testing was conducted by trial staff [21].

A randomised trial noted that patients with positive FilmArray\u00ae POC results received shorter courses of antibiotics and had shorter hospital stays than those with negative POC results [21]. Our 20\u201324% positive yield may be because our study was seasonally limited and extended in to the summer months.

This rapid initiation of antibiotics was also found in a randomised trial of FilmArray\u00ae POC testing [21] and is consistent with guidelines that recommend antibiotic treatment for CAP within 4 h of presentation to hospital [3]. Therefore, we would expect almost all patients to be initially started on an antibiotic. However with the delay in POC testing we would not expect this parameter to be impacted, i.e. if testing had been done in an appropriate time frame (<4 h after patient evaluation) the subsequent initiation or discontinuation may have been significantly influenced. Some of this reflects a continuation on the study wards of antibiotics started in the ED. Even with a positive POC result, AMU doctors may be dissuaded on safety grounds from stopping or de-escalating antibiotics that were started on the basis of a clinical assessment that they did not witness in the ED. Our findings are consistent with a randomised trial of FilmArray\u00ae POC testing, which found that the mean duration of antibiotics did not differ between the FilmArray\u00ae and control arms. However that group identified that a greater proportion of patients in the intervention arm (with a POC result) than in the control arm received only a single dose of antibiotics or <48 h of antibiotics [21], something that we did not assess in the present study. Other trials of RP diagnostics in adults, including FilmArray\u00ae, have found that PCR detection of only a viral pathogen coupled with a low procalcitonin level led to antibiotic cessation in only 32% of cases [28] or a trend towards fewer days of antibiotic treatment off-set by only 4/18 patients having their antibiotics stopped [29]. The authors of the latter study advocate real-time stewardship with RP results, which was omitted from the intervention in the present study. Rapid pathogen identification with antimicrobial stewardship has been associated with a significant reduction of hospital costs for adult in-patients [17].",

            "text": "This study has other limitations, nearly all due to limited resources. We employed a pragmatic quasi-randomised design, allocating patients to the intervention arm on even days making the study vulnerable to bias due to differences in patients allocated to the study arms. Though we found no evidence for such differences, and the outcome analysis adjusted for several pre-specified potential confounders, a fully randomised design would have provided a stronger level of evidence. There were more patients in the intervention arm suggesting that the patient recruitment processes in the two arms were not equivalent and this may reflect enthusiasm for the FilmArray\u00ae. This may also reflect increased disease severity in the intervention arm and a need to identify the cause of the disease, thereby resulting in a biased use of the FilmArray\u00ae in this cohort. CURB-65 scores were not assessed and therefore an accurate comparison of the severity of the pneumonia in the two arms of the study could not be determined. Further, we did not collect data on the type of RTI; a randomised trial of FilmArray\u00ae POC testing recorded a shorter duration of antibiotics for patients with asthma and COPD who were in the intervention arm versus the control and a shorter length of stay for COPD patients in the FilmArray\u00ae arm [21]. The ED does not routinely use EPMA and so we do not know exactly how many patients received antibiotics there. A negative time to antibiotics, due to administrative errors, was changed to 0 h in 30% of patients however the median was small (\u22121.5 h) and this phenomenon occurred in both study arms. As in other similar studies on this subject [21] we did not include routine bacteriology results in the analysis however the hypothesis had greater dependence upon the predominantly viral panel results under investigation and bacteriology results would not be expected to differ between the study arms and thus influence results. Finally, the number of eligible patients admitted to the study wards was less than predicted by the data used to plan the study and hence the number of cases recruited fell short of the statistical calculation that required 1131 patients in each arm to detect a fall of 0.6 days. It is not clear why this was the case but may be related to patients by-passing the study wards during the busy winter months of January to March and due to the inclusion of some summer months in the study.",

A panel which includes common bacterial causes of lower RTI would probably have identified more pathogens in this setting. A recent study in the UK identified bacteria in lower respiratory tract specimens from 81% of patients with pneumonia [27]. Though we did not record the type of RTI in this study, as in-patients, most patients probably had a lower RTI. A study in the ED might have tested a greater number of patients with a viral illness. There, POC results could provide reassurance that discharge is reasonable. With a rapid result and the broader RP panel afforded by FilmArray\u00ae, it is plausible that safety-netting antibiotic prescriptions would have reduced. Due to the mandated maximum 4-h wait for patients in English EDs [30] and a perceived lack of understanding of these results vocalised by our ED staff (because with laboratory-based testing the patient has left ED when results are available), we moved the study one step in to the hospital. This highlights an important knowledge gap. An ED-based study of POC testing incorporating decision making support is therefore advisable.",

This result was most likely influenced by the delay in the rapid POC testing. POC testing produced results considerably faster than the routine tests but the results were not rapid as designed to be. This was not the fault of the POC test, but highlights the fact that new technology itself is not enough: the correct systems must be in place in order to reap their benefits. Patients who had the POC test received time-critical antivirals for influenza significantly faster and appropriate therapy for mycoplasma infection, not seen in the control arm. Ward staff of all grades performed the POC test without incident meaning that this test has potential across a range of healthcare. Further studies are required that focus on implementing respiratory multiplex PCR POC testing with rapid results, in order to fully assess the impact on length of stay and antibiotic use.",
