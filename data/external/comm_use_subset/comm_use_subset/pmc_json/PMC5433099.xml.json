The binding of gD to one of several host receptors results in a conformational change in gD that is proposed to signal the gH/gL heterodimer to trigger the fusogenic activity of gB (1\u20133). Entry receptors that bind to gD include herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) (4), nectin-1 (5, 6), nectin-2 (7, 8), and modified heparan sulfate (HS) (9, 10). Another receptor, paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor (PILR\u03b1), binds to gB and can mediate viral entry, provided that gD also binds to a receptor (11).",

Viral fusion proteins initially fold to a metastable prefusion state. Upon triggering, the proteins insert themselves into the cellular membrane and refold from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation to bring the viral and cell membranes together. Crystal structures of the postfusion gB conformation have been solved for three herpesviruses (12, 14\u201316). The prefusion conformation of gB and the details of how it refolds to execute fusion are unclear. Attempts to capture a stable prefusion form of HSV-1 gB for crystallization have been unsuccessful (17).",

            "text": "gB is trimeric and consists of five domains (Fig. 1A). The postfusion gB structure adopts a hairpin conformation wherein the hydrophobic fusion loops that insert themselves into the host cell membrane reside at the same end of the molecule as the C terminus of the ectodomain, the site where the transmembrane domain would connect. This hairpin arrangement is common for the postfusion form of fusion proteins. A central coiled-coil core consisting of three \u03b1-helices in domain III contributes to the stability of the trimer. The C-terminal region of the ectodomain (domain V) consists of a long arm that extends down the length of the molecule and packs into a groove in the central coiled coil. The antiparallel packing of this arm against the coiled-coil helices is reminiscent of the six-helix bundle present in the postfusion conformation of class I fusion proteins. Formation of the class I six-helix bundle is proposed to help overcome the energy barrier to membrane fusion (18). We hypothesize that gB refolds similarly to class I fusion proteins and that the arm packing against the coiled coil provides a driving force for the gB conformational change from its prefusion to its postfusion form. Interestingly, electron cryotomography of gB on vesicles revealed a gB conformation that lacks the coil-arm complex, supporting the concept that this complex may be absent from the prefusion form (19).",

            "text": "Our previous mutagenesis study demonstrated that fusion was impaired by mutations in the domain V arm that were predicted to disrupt the coil-arm interaction (20). This phenotype could be rescued by the addition of a hyperfusogenic mutation in the gB cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that the reduced fusion phenotype was not due to global misfolding. When three alanine substitutions were made simultaneously in the gB arm (I671A, H681A, and F683A; gB 3A here), fusion was greatly reduced in a cell-cell fusion assay. If the interaction of the arm with the coil contributes to the conversion from a prefusion to a postfusion form, the gB 3A mutations may energetically favor the prefusion state of gB.",

Addition of the gB 3A mutations to the viral genome permitted analysis of multistep growth curves and plaque sizes, data that cannot be collected by using a virus that is complemented phenotypically. Our results showed that a gB 3A mutant virus had impaired growth and significantly delayed penetration of cells. We found that elevated temperatures could partially rescue the penetration of cells by gB 3A virus. The ability of heat to overcome the penetration defect is consistent with the hypothesis that the gB 3A mutations favor the prefusion conformation. The mutations did not impact virus binding to cells, and increasing the expression of gH/gL did not compensate for the gB 3A fusion defect in a cell-cell fusion assay.",

The gB 3A-encoding gene was then recombined into BAC pQF282 to generate BAC pQF297 (Fig. 1D). At each step of these constructions, intermediate BACs (with kanamycin resistance [Kanr]-encoding gene insertions) and final BACs (with the Kanr-encoding gene insertions removed) were confirmed by at least four restriction enzyme digestions. For example, BamHI digestions of the BACs show the expected band shifts for pQF282 and pQF297 (Fig. 1E and F). Band 1 is present only in the wild-type (WT) BAC, and band 2 is present only in the intermediate BAC with Kanr-encoding gene insertions but not in the BAC with UL27 deleted or the WT BAC (Fig. 1E). Similarly, band 3 is present only in the intermediate BAC with Kanr-encoding gene insertions, band 4 is present only in the final gB 3A BAC, and band 5 (consisting of two bands that migrate as one because of the similarity of their molecular weights) is present only in the WT BAC and the BAC with UL27 deleted (Fig. 1F).",

Relative to the GS3217 (WT) gB plaques, the gB 3A plaques were approximately 200-fold smaller, with a 50- to 300-fold range of reduction (Fig. 3B). The plaque size was partially restored when VgB cells (Vero-24 cells expressing WT gB) were infected with the gB 3A viruses (Fig. 3A), with gB 3A plaques sizes only two to three times smaller than those of the WT (Fig. 3B). This partial restoration of plaque size suggests that the mutations in the gB-encoding gene of gB 3A are responsible for the small-plaque phenotype. Notably, GS3217 (WT) virus formed larger plaques than gB 3A virus on both Vero and VgB cells. Although VgB cells express WT gB during gB 3A infection, the GS3217 (WT) virus may provide a greater level of WT gB during infection and this virus-encoded WT gB may contribute to the larger WT plaque size seen in VgB cells.",

Vero cells were infected with the viruses at 0.01 PFU/cell, and virus titers were determined every 12 h until 48 hpi. At 12 hpi, the GS3217 (WT) virus titer had increased but the gB 3A virus titers had not. At 24 hpi, the gB 3A titers lagged behind the GS3217 (WT) virus titer by more than 5 log units (Fig. 4B).

As expected, the citrate buffer treatment did not affect the entry of the G3217 (WT) compared with the PBS control because maximal penetration has occurred by 2 hpi (Fig. 8C). As previously seen, the gB 3A viruses failed to penetrate the cells after a 6-h incubation at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 8A and B); however, a small number of plaques were apparent when the gB 3A viruses were incubated with cells for 4 h at 40\u00b0C prior to citrate buffer treatment (Fig. 8D and E). These results suggest that the energy provided by the increased temperature may overcome the penetration defect in the gB 3A virus, potentially by promoting the prefusion-to-postfusion conformational change in gB.",

This assay permits the titration of different levels of gH/gL DNA, which results in different levels of protein expression. Expression of higher levels of gH/gL may compensate for a weak interaction between gB 3A and gH/gL. When cells were cotransfected with gD, gH, gL, and gB 3A, increasing the amounts of gH and gL DNA transfected did not enhance cell-cell fusion (Fig. 9C). In fact, greater levels of gH/gL DNA impaired the fusion mediated by gB 3A. These results do not exclude the possibility that the gB 3A mutant has a defect in gH/gL interaction; however, the results do not support the hypothesis either.",

In the current model of entry, gD binding to an entry receptor relays a signal to gH/gL that is transmitted to gB to trigger fusion (31). To explore whether the defects in gB 3A function are due to a deficiency in its gH/gL interaction, we used a cell-cell fusion assay that allowed us to titrate increasing levels of gH/gL DNA (Fig. 9). If the gB 3A fusion defect is due to a reduced capacity to interact with the fusion regulator gH/gL, higher levels of gH/gL expression might compensate for the defect. Transfection with high levels of gH/gL DNA did not enhance fusion mediated by gB 3A, and thus, the hypothesis that gB 3A has impaired an interaction with gH/gL was not supported.",

For herpesviruses, an interaction with gH/gL is proposed to destabilize the prefusion conformation of gB to trigger the conformational change that mediates fusion. Heat has been used previously as a surrogate trigger for several class I and III fusion proteins to transition from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation (29, 39\u201345). To explore whether the defects in gB 3A fusion could be overcome by heat, the viral penetration rate was examined at an elevated temperature. At 37\u00b0C, penetration by the gB 3A viruses required more than 10 h of incubation with cells (Fig. 5); however, penetration was detectable after only 4 h at 40\u00b0C (Fig. 8). Although heat may impact multiple stages of the HSV-1 infectious cycle, WT virus penetration was unaffected by the 40\u00b0C incubation. The absence of a nonspecific enhancement of WT virus penetration at 40\u00b0C suggests that heat partially rescued the cell penetration of the gB 3A virus by affecting the gB 3A protein.",

Transfected cells were cocultured with effector CHO cells that had been transfected with plasmids encoding T7 polymerase, gD, gH, gL, and either WT gB or gB 3A. After coincubation overnight, luciferase activity was measured as an indication of cell-cell fusion. Background signals (effector cells transfected with the vector only) were subtracted, and the data were normalized to the fusion activity observed with WT gB. Data were normalized separately for each receptor. Each bar shows the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. (B, C) Impact of gH/gL levels on fusion mediated by WT gB (B) or gB 3A (C). Target CHO cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding luciferase under the control of the T7 promoter and a plasmid encoding either HVEM or nectin-1. Effector CHO cells were transfected separately with plasmids encoding T7 polymerase, gD, gH, gL, and gB (B) or gB 3A (C). Increasing amounts of gH and gL plasmid DNA were added to the effector cell transfections. Target cells were cocultured with effector cells overnight, and luciferase activity was measured as an indication of cell-cell fusion. Background signals (effector cells transfected with the vector only) were subtracted, and data were normalized to the level of fusion achieved by WT gB in cells transfected with 0.8 \u00b5g each of the gH and gL plasmids (standard gH/gL levels). Fusion with each receptor was normalized independently. V denotes empty-vector DNA transfected into the effector cells. Each bar shows the mean and standard deviation of three independent determinations.",
