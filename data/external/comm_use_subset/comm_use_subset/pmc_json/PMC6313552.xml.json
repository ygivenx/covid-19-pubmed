            "text": "Health workers (HWs) run an increased risk of contracting infectious diseases. This increased risk is well documented for a variety of old infections such as tuberculosis [1,2,3], blood-borne virus infections such as hepatitis C [4], and influenza [5]. However, it also exists for new infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrom (SARS) [6,7,8,9], the H1N1-pandemic in 2009 [10,11], and multidrug resistant bacteria like Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) [12]. For the USA researchers estimated the excess death rate due to infections in HWs as 9\u201329 per one million HWs [13]. Therefore, efforts are made to protect HWs against infections [14]. The Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act (NSPA) enacted in the USA in 2000 was a landmark in protecting HWs from blood-borne virus infections. The NSPA mandates that employers select safer needle devices and train employees on the proper use of all engineering and work practice controls [15]. The American example was followed by European Union regulations encouraging the use of safe instruments in healthcare that were soon implemented in Germany [16,17]. Health workers are consulted on infection prevention measures and examined for infectious diseases on a regular basis. If a vaccination for a particular infection such as hepatitis B exists and if HWs are at risk of this infection, vaccination is offered at the employer\u2019s expense and the occupational health physician is responsible for recommending and performing the vaccination [18]. Depending on the risk assessment, the employer has to provide personal protective equipment (PPE). Consideration of different approaches for the protection of HWs gives rise to the question of how well these regulations and obligations protect HWs against infections at the workplace. One possible way to answer this question is by analysing the time trends of occupational diseases (ODs) caused by infections in HWs [19]. In Germany, as in many other countries, infection in a HW can be recognised as an OD and be compensated accordingly. For example, from 1996 to 2013 a total of 1121 hepatitis C infections in HWs were recognised as ODs in Germany and a total of EUR 52 million was paid to compensate for the loss of ability to work. A further EUR 36 million was paid for medical treatment of these HWs between 2000 and 2014 [20]. ",

A total of 630,000 companies with about eight million insured persons are covered by the BGW. In addition to HWs, the insured persons can be hairdressers, social workers, and volunteers. In Germany, about one-third of all hospitals are public and therefore covered by other state-held insurances. However, in recent years some public hospitals were privatised and changed to having the BGW as their insurer. The BGW\u2019s standardised database of compensation claims relating to infectious disease was used for this analysis. Data on infections caused by animals or tropical diseases was not included. The database makes it possible to distinguish between the most frequent infectious diseases. The date of registration of a claim and the decision whether the claim is confirmed as an OD are documented in this standardised data set. As the decision on the claim may not be reached in the year when the claim is filed, or because several decisions can be taken due to the appeal of a decision, the number of claims decided differs from the number of claims filed in a particular year. Therefore, a valid confirmation rate cannot be calculated per year. An average confirmation rate was calculated by summarising all registered claims and all confirmed cases for the total period. This does not provide an exact confirmation rate but an estimate that should be rather close to the true value.",

It is not mandatory to report contacts with infectious patients or materials. Therefore, they were excluded from this analysis. Time trends from 1996 to 2017 were analysed for mandatory claims only. A distinction can be made between tuberculosis (TB), latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, influenza, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). All other infections were combined in the category \u2018Other Infections\u2019. Latent tuberculosis infection is considered present if the interferon-\u03b3 release assay (IGRA) is positive, and active TB is excluded by X-ray. Infections with parasites are not considered, as in the case of these infections the data set does not allow for a clear distinction between contact with patients with parasitic infection and actual infection.",

The time trend was quite different for blood-borne virus infections than for TB. While an increase was observed for TB, the decrease in HBV and HCV infections explains the overall decrease in ODs over time. Advances in HW vaccinations against HBV infection are the most likely explanation for the decrease of HBV infection in HWs [21]. As vaccination is not mandatory, different steps were taken to improve the vaccination rate in HWs. There is provision for a mandatory consultation with occupational physicians at least every third year for HWs at risk [18]. After a needle stick injury (NSI), vaccination status is checked and vaccination is started if needed. In addition, a vaccination campaign was mounted by BGW in 2002. As well as sponsoring vaccination and thereby covering some of the cost for the employer, BGW carried out an information campaign focusing on the responsibility of employers and employees for preventing nosocomial transmission. This campaign was not evaluated, but it is reasonable to assume that it helped to increase awareness and therefore improve the vaccination rate among HWs. Two recent surveys found HBV vaccination rates of 70% in nurses [22] and 94% in dentists [23]. Therefore, a high vaccination rate in HWs in Germany can be assumed, although no systematic analysis exists. Germany is a low incidence country for HBV infections. In 2001, a total of 3876 new HBV infections were registered for the general population. This number decreased to 1684 in 2012. Thereafter the number of registered HBV infections increased again to 3622 cases [24]. The decline of HBV infection in HWs can therefore only partly be explained by the epidemiologic situation in the general population.",

The decrease of HCV infection in HWs is partly due to the decline of HCV infection among the general population. Germany is a low incidence country for HCV infections. In 2004, a total of 9,044 new HCV infections were registered for the general population. This number decreased to 4,798 (53.1%) in 2017 [25]. Therefore, the decrease in the general population was less pronounced than the one for HWs. Most likely this is due to the use of safe instruments, double gloves, safe disposal of used instruments, and general awareness of HWs [26]. In Germany, the number of NSI claims filed with the BGW increased [27]. We assume that this is not due to a real increase in NSIs but to the increased awareness that NSIs might have dangerous consequences. This interpretation is supported by the decrease in HCV infections recorded as suspected OD. In addition, 30% to 50% of NSI claims filed nowadays are caused by needles for subcutaneous injections [28]. These devices pose a lower infection risk than blood collecting devices [29].",

At first glance, this observation is contradictory. However, this development is caused by two factors unrelated to the actual infection risk or the recent increase in TB among the general population due to the migration crisis in 2015 [32]. First, the perception of infection risks for HWs changed. Until 2003, only a few healthcare tasks were believed to be associated with an increased risk of infection for HWs. In 2003, an expert panel reconsidered these assumptions and came to the conclusion that all HWs working at entry points to the healthcare system where patients are not yet diagnosed (e.g., emergency rooms, surgery, nursing homes) are at increased risk of TB infection. Furthermore, delayed diagnosis of TB in patients is a particular risk factor for TB transmission in hospitals and other health facilities [33]. After the likelihood of accepting TB as an OD increased, the number of claims increased. Second, with the introduction of IGRA the diagnosis of LTBI became more reliable [34,35,36,37,38]. Therefore, from 2006 the number of claims relating to LTBI started to increase. Whenever preventive treatment is performed in these cases, the costs can be covered by the insurance. As such, the increased number of cases does not necessarily reflect an increased risk, but increased protection of HWs. ",

The average rate is 1.5% [47,48,49]. In a review comprising eight German surveys, an average colonisation rate of 3.1% for HWs was described. This rate was well above the colonisation rate in the general population (0.2%). Nurses were more often affected than physicians [12]. As colonisation of a HW with MRSA is not covered by accident insurance, occupational health physicians are reluctant to screen HWs for MRSA due to not knowing how to manage cases of MRSA-positive HWs who are not only transitorily colonised [50,51,52]. In order to prevent transmission of MRSA from HWs to patients, regulations are needed for the screening of HWs and the management of MRSA-positive HWs.",

HWs with migration background have a higher risk for infection (i.e., the prevalence of LTBI in HWs with migration background is twice as high as in HWs born in Germany) [38]. However, the effect of migration on the time trend of infections as OD cannot be studied with the data available. Another problem might result from underreporting of infections as ODs. Underreporting is evident for influenza. For active TB, underreporting is the explanation for fewer cases reported before 2003, as physicians knew that the chances for the confirmation of TB as OD were low. Even though the degree of underreporting cannot be estimated, underreporting is an unlikely explanation for the positive trend in HBV and HCV infections in HWs. A further shortcoming of this analysis is the lack of information on workplace and job titles. However, from earlier projects it can be concluded that about 70% of all ODs in HWs concern hospitals or nursing homes [53]. About 75% of all HWs with OD-related infections are women [20].",
