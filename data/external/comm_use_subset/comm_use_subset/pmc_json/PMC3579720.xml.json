Acute diarrhoeal episodes are mainly due to bacterial and viral pathogens that may cause a variety of clinical syndromes ranging from self-limiting events to life-threatening diseases. Children are most vulnerable and diarrhoeal diseases were responsible for more than 1.4 million deaths in 2010, ranking this disorder at position seven on the main causes of death\n[4]. In the last decades, concerted efforts have considerably improved our understanding of the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and control of many diarrhoeagenic pathogens globally, for instance due to the introduction of rotavirus vaccination programmes in many countries since 2006\n[5]. As a result, mortality due to diarrhoeal diseases has been reduced from an estimated 2.5 million in 1990 to just under 1.5 million in 2010, a decrease of 42%\n[4]. However, few research activities have focused on the investigation of persistent diarrhoea and non-acute abdominal pain due to digestive disorders in the tropics. Hence, little is known regarding its aetiology, epidemiology and disease burden. It is widely acknowledged that intestinal parasites, particularly helminths and intestinal protozoa play a major role as causative agents of persistent digestive symptomatologies\n[6].",

Hence, affected people might only seek care at a late stage in their therapeutic itinerary, usually at primary health care centres\n[19,20]. However, these primary health care centres are often under-staffed and ill-equipped, resulting in a low quality of care. The causes of persistent diarrhoea and other digestive disorders are frequently misdiagnosed due to the often unspecific clinical presentations and the absence of evidence-based algorithms for in-depth investigation\n[7,21]. The notorious underfinancing of health systems in many tropical and subtropical countries explains the severe neglect of laboratory networks and the only limited availability of basic tests for diagnostic services (e.g. direct faecal smears for helminth diagnosis or blood films for malaria diagnosis)\n[22]. Hence, in many developing countries, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms are often empirical, whereas local prevalence data and differential diagnoses are rarely taken into account at the primary care level.",

Emphasis is placed on a patient-centred approach starting from the presentation at the primary health care level of a clinical syndrome that might be due to \u2018common\u2019 pathogens. Three clinical syndromes will be investigated in the NIDIAG framework, namely (1) neurological disorders\n[23]; (2) persistent fever\n[24]; and (3) digestive disorders. Here, we focus on digestive disorders, which we define as (i) persistent (\u22652 weeks) abdominal pain; (ii) persistent (\u22652 weeks) diarrhoea (dysenteric or non-dysenteric); and/or (iii) blood in the stool. These digestive disorders will be investigated at different study sites in tropical areas of Africa (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Mali) and Asia (Indonesia and Nepal). Before clinically applicable diagnosis-treatment algorithms can be developed, the following major challenges/open issues have to be addressed. Firstly, few studies analysed the spectrum of intestinal pathogens causing persistent digestive disorders in the tropics. Therefore, epidemiological investigations targeting all potential pathogens are desirable to define the most common bacteria, parasites and viruses in the different study settings. Secondly, most diagnostic tests have only been validated in Western settings, and hence their diagnostic accuracy in the tropics remains to be determined.",

Stool culture has important advantages, such as testing of isolated pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibility. As the successful antibiotic treatment of many bacterial intestinal infections requires knowledge of local resistance patterns (e.g. extent of fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter strains), stool culture techniques remain mandatory to guide therapeutic interventions. However, these tests are laborious and require experienced personnel, and typically take 48\u201372 hours to obtain first results. Hence, other, more rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been developed for some pathogens. For Campylobacter spp., for example, EIAs detecting a specific antigen in the stool proved to be a sensitive alternative to stool culture with results available within a few hours\n[32,99]. However, there is no international consensus on immunological assays for detection of Campylobacter spp. and no globally validated and standardised approach, so that these tools should not replace the selective stool culture\n[100]. PCR assays, characterised by high sensitivity and specificity, have been developed for most of the aforementioned bacteria. Thus far, however, integration into clinical routine testing is still limited. Important drawbacks are the high cost, the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment and well-trained laboratory technicians. Moreover, PCR cannot distinguish between dead or alive bacteria and does not allow testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. However, newly developed multiplex PCR assays are increasingly being evaluated as fast screening tests for early detection of various important enteric pathogens. Besides PCR, novel molecular diagnostics are currently being developed and validated for many bacterial and viral pathogens, e.g. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays. Results obtained thus far are promising\n[101,102], but it remains to be elucidated whether such nucleic acid amplification tests can be employed on a larger scale in resource-constrained settings in the tropics.",

Contrary to non-typhoidal salmonellosis, stool culture is not sufficiently sensitive to diagnose infection due to S. Typhi/S. Paratyphi. Culturing blood and bone marrow is more sensitive, but bone marrow aspiration is only rarely performed in tropical areas due to a lack of adequately equipped hospitals and laboratories\n[104].

Sensitivity and specificity of PCR have been reported to vary between 85% and 100%\n[108]. However, various molecular assays exist which are not yet fully standardised, and the diagnostic performance of commercially available kits may differ considerably from in-house molecular testing methods in use at different laboratories.

This procedure does not require an extensively equipped laboratory and generates accurate results within a few hours.

Accurate diagnosis is difficult and relies on in-depth analysis of intestinal biopsy specimens by histopathological examination, microscopy after acid-fast staining (e.g. Ziehl-Neelsen, Auramin or Kinyoun techniques) and culture on selective media suitable for mycobacteria. Unless performed using oil immersion, histopathology often fails to distinguish between gastrointestinal tuberculosis and other granulomatous disorders, such as Crohn\u2019s disease\n[113,114].

            "text": "The three main techniques for the diagnosis of human intestinal protozoan infections include (i) light microscopy; (ii) antigen detection (EIAs); and (iii) PCR assays. Since the first description of parasitic intestinal protozoa in human stools, documented by the Dutch microscopist Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1681\n[119], microscopic detection of protozoan cysts and trophozoites has been the most widely used diagnostic approach. On fresh stool samples, direct microscopy is performed by mixing a small amount of faeces with a physiological 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. To increase sensitivity, various stool concentration techniques have been developed, making use of either sedimentation or flotation with a formalin-ether concentration technique being the most widely used method in medical laboratories\n[120,121]. However, the formalin-ether concentration technique lacks sensitivity for several intestinal protozoan species as well as many helminths (described below), and hence there is a pressing need for new and more sensitive microscopic techniques (e.g. FLOTAC)\n[122] and non-microscopic diagnostics. Staining techniques can be helpful for microscopic parasite identification and might further improve the diagnostic accuracy. Indeed, some intestinal protozoan species require staining of the stool sample to be identified on microscopic examination. For example, acid-fast stains allow detection of Cryptosporidium spp., while species of microsporidia are best seen when using an Uvitex B or Calcofluor White stain. Still, correct identification of intestinal protozoan pathogens is challenging even for experienced laboratory technicians and for some species even impossible (e.g. E. histolytica based on cysts morphology). For Cryptosporidium spp., E. histolytica and G. intestinalis, sensitive EIAs detecting species-specific antigens in faecal samples have been developed, some of which are highly sensitive and complement microscopic stool examination in many clinical laboratories\n[123,124]. Especially for the diagnosis of E. histolytica, species differentiation based on alternative procedures is compulsory, since microscopy cannot readily distinguish between E. histolytica and the non-pathogenic E. dispar[66,125,126]. Of note, not all commercially available EIA antigen detection kits are E. histolytica-specific and some lack sensitivity, in particular if faecal samples have been stored for several days\n[67,127]. Over the past several years, highly sensitive PCR assays have been developed and standardised for many intestinal protozoan species. Many of these assays (e.g. Entamoeba spp. differentiation by PCR) are currently being integrated into parasitological reference laboratories as an additional diagnostic tool to prove diagnosis in uncertain clinical cases\n[59,128,129]. Such molecular biological tools are of enormous importance to improve the correct species identification of many intestinal parasites, which are difficult to diagnose using conventional techniques\n[60,74].",

In hospitals and microbiological laboratories, direct stool examination after prior concentration (e.g. by formalin-ether concentration technique) is most commonly employed, while the Kato-Katz thick smear technique is widely used in epidemiological studies and anthelminthic drug efficacy evaluations in endemic regions\n[81,130-132]. Direct microscopic examination is a cheap methodology, the microscope slides can rapidly be prepared for examination, and there is no need for sophisticated laboratory equipment. The eggs of most helminth species parasitising humans can easily be distinguished by a trained laboratory technician (see Figure \n1 for eight selected helminth eggs). Hence, microscopy remains the standard reference test for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, hookworm, Capillaria philippinensis, Diphyllobothrium spp., Hymenolepis spp., Taenia spp. and blood flukes (Schistosoma spp.)\n[82,88,133,134]. However, microscopy is prone to a number of shortcomings. Firstly, microscopy is not very sensitive and especially infections of light intensity can be missed when only a single stool sample is analysed\n[131,135]. Multiple stool sampling, ideally over several consecutive days, increases the sensitivity\n[136], as well as the use of different concentration techniques, which are based on sedimentation (e.g. formalin-ether concentration technique), flotation or a combination of both (e.g. McMaster technique and FLOTAC)\n[135,137-139]. However, these techniques often require access to the power grid, a centrifuge and different chemical reagents, which are not always available in tropical settings. Moreover, the diagnostic sensitivity for different helminth species often varies considerably, and no currently available concentration technique is able to concurrently detect intestinal protozoa and helminths with the same diagnostic accuracy\n[122,140].",

Indeed, PCR is seldom available in the most affected regions, and its results often do not guide clinicians\u2019 decisions, as empiric treatment with albendazole and mebendazole is commonly employed and effective against many helminth species in endemic areas\n[7]. Due to the variety of intestinal parasites causing digestive disorders, a multiplex real-time PCR targeting a host of various pathogens is much more desirable than individual PCR assays for each parasite, and such multiplex PCRs have been successfully developed and are increasingly used in reference laboratories in industrialised countries\n[59,83,142].

Most commonly employed are the Baermann funnel and the Koga agar plate\n[143]. The Baermann method is a concentration technique based on the nematode\u2019s hydrophily and thermophily. It provides results within a few hours and is the technique of choice according to the World Gastroenterology Organization\n[144], but there is some debate whether it is as sensitive as agar plate cultures\n[86]. Derived from classical charcoal culture assays and its sequel, the so-called Harada-Mori culture, Koga and colleagues developed a special agar plate to detect S. stercoralis and hookworm larvae\n[145]. The agar plates are stored for 48 hours in a humid chamber and the traces of the helminths can then be seen on the agar and the larvae can easily be collected for microscopic species identification. In contrast to many other helminth infections, where exact species identification often is not necessarily required and clinical symptoms are mild, the recognition of strongyloidiasis and initiation of an effective treatment with ivermectin is essential to prevent potentially life-threatening events due to its ability to cause disseminated hyperinfection in the immunosuppressed population\n[141,146]. Hence, the aforementioned laborious techniques seem to be justified and a combination of the Baermann funnel and the Koga agar plate method may lead to the most accurate results.",

However, the sensitivity fluctuates, depending on infection stage and intensity\n[148]. Hence, concentration methods like an ether-concentration, the Kato-Katz thick smear or the recently developed FLOTAC technique are important tools to increase sensitivity\n[89]. Moreover, examination of multiple (preferably at least three) stool samples collected on consecutive days is recommended\n[136,149]. In contrast to other helminth infections, immunological RDTs have been developed for detection of intestinal (S. mansoni) and urogenital schistosomiasis (S. haematobium). Worm-gut associated glycoproteins, namely circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) and circulating anodic antigen (CAA), can be detected in the serum and the urine of S. mansoni-infected individuals using genus-specific monoclonal antibodies\n[150,151]. Immunochromatographic point-of-care (POC) dipstick or cassette tests for rapid diagnosis of S. mansoni via CCA detection in the urine are currently being validated in different epidemiological settings and will potentially become a valuable tool for non-microscopic diagnosis of schistosomiasis in epidemiological studies and clinical practice. Recent studies suggest that the diagnostic accuracy of a single POC-CCA test is considerably more sensitive than a single Kato-Katz thick smear and that a concurrent S. haematobium infection does not influence the POC-CCA test results for S. mansoni diagnosis, which is an important observation due to the co-endemicity of both blood fluke infections in many tropical areas\n[152,153].

In infected individuals, viral particles are shed in high concentrations. In general, virus isolation followed by serotyping remains the \u2018gold\u2019 standard for the detection of all serotypes and is possible on different cell lines (Table \n5). Importantly, 293-Graham cells should be used for stool samples as adenovirus species F (adenovirus types 40 and 41) can only be cultivated on this cell line. However, virus isolation is rather laborious and time-consuming in the face of urgent requests for diagnosis. Electron microscopy is possible with high specificity, but low sensitivity. As an alternative method that is particularly useful for examination of stool samples, antigen detection assays using EIA or latex agglutination have been developed\n[160,161]. These assays are rapid, but displayed varying sensitivities and specificities in studies, and hence should be complemented by alternative methods. Molecular methods, in particular real-time PCR, have demonstrated superior performance over conventional methods and are now the cornerstone for diagnosis in most laboratories, but are seldom available in resource-constrained settings.",

Thirdly, studies should be carried out in different social-ecological settings to assess the influence of cultural, demographic, genetic, geographic, socioeconomic and health system related factors on predominating pathogens. Fourthly, such research must address all pathogen classes and should not be limited to one-dimensional approaches examining either bacteria or parasites only. Fifthly, there are certain issues unique to gastrointestinal diseases which clearly distinguish them from other organ disorders; most importantly, the finding of a given pathogen may not necessarily mean that the patient\u2019s complaints are caused by this organism\n[179]. Bacteria, helminths and intestinal protozoa may often be found as harmless commensals or even beneficial parts of the gastrointestinal flora, and thus such findings may represent coincidence rather than causality\n[180-182]. This is of particular importance when different potential pathogens are found concurrently in one faecal specimen and the causative one(s) have to be differentiated. Sixthly, even primarily non-intestinal infectious pathogens may cause gastrointestinal symptoms, as has been reported for HIV infection and even malaria in the tropics, where acute or long-lasting diarrhoea may be the only symptom in up to 20% of all observed cases\n[183,184]. In contrast, patients may as well start to complain about reduced well-being and develop clinical symptoms only some weeks to months after clearance of an intestinal pathogen, as is the case in postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome\n[185]. Finally, the variety of possible pathogens affecting the gut is so exhaustive that even very sophisticated diagnostic approaches will not be able to detect every pathogen with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, especially when considering the cost and practical applicability of some specialised techniques that are not currently feasible in most parts of the tropics.",

            "text": "There is a pressing need for research targeting persistent digestive disorders as a coherent clinical problem rather than as a disconnected collection of pathologies. This would allow the elaboration of evidence-based diagnosis-treatment algorithms centred on patients in resource-constrained settings, where data availability is scarce and patient management often driven by experience and local beliefs. This is the overarching goal of the NIDIAG consortium, focusing on digestive disorders as discussed here, as well as on neurological disorders\n[23] and persistent fever\n[24]. Additionally, such investigations will optimise the use of existing diagnostic tests and advance the development of new methods, which are ideally able to concurrently detect a broad spectrum of intestinal pathogens with a high sensitivity and specificity, and which are simple and affordable enough to be performed in low-income countries where prevalences of persistent digestive disorders are generally high. Moreover, the thorough evaluation of reference tests for intestinal pathogens can serve as diagnostic \u2018gold\u2019 standard in the standardisation and validation of easily applicable RDTs, which are highly needed tools in resource-constrained field settings. Finally, such in-depth investigations are not only important for individual patient management, but also for public health policy making (e.g. to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ongoing preventive chemotherapy control programmes targeting helminthiases). There is a need for improved diagnostics for persistent digestive disorders in the tropics. It is desirable to conduct a multicentric study to investigate the clinical presentations and respective identified pathogens of large patient cohorts presenting with non-acute gastrointestinal diseases as a first step towards more reliable and evidence-based clinical case management in the tropics.",
