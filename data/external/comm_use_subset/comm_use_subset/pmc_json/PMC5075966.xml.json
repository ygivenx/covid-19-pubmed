In response to 5-minute treatment of CII, the extracellular ATP concentrations were increased in a dose-dependent manner as compared with unstimulated controls (Fig. 2A). Extracellular ATP levels were also measured in DCs cultured with 20 \u03bcg/ml CII for 6, 12 or 24 h. In control wells, ATP levels remained constant, whereas continuous treatment increased ATP levels up to 6 folds (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, CII treatment groups exhibited significantly higher P2X7R levels than the control group (Fig. 2C). In DC cultures treated with apyrase (an ATP diphosphohydrolase, 0.5 U/ml), CII failed to elevate the level of P2X7R, ruling out the possible involvement of endogenous ATP (Fig. 2D). Pretreatment with P2X7R antagonists (Suramin and A-438079) abolished the promoting effect of CII on ATP release from DCs (Fig. 2E). In the early stages of culture, cell viability was unaffected by CII treatment (Fig. 2F). So, the results reveal that CII-induced ATP release from DCs require the presence of P2X7R function.",

Suramin completely blocked the CII-stimulated ATP secretion at the doses of 30 and 100 \u03bcM (Fig. 3A). We chose a lower dose of 30 \u03bcM of Suramin in this study to avoid potential toxicity. Only A-438079 at 300 nM could completely block the CII-stimulated P2X7R activation (Fig. 3B). Thus, 30 \u03bcM Suramin and 300 nM A-438079 were administered in the following experiments to ensure a better competitiveness.

Extracellular ATP signaling acting through the P2X7R played an important regulatory/modulatory role in the pathogenesis of RA35. In RA patients, a high concentration of extracellular ATP is present in the synovial fluid36. Expression of P2X7R was higher in monocytes from patients with RA compared with controls37. Similarly, we also observed significantly increased P2X7R expression in the RA patients as compared to their normal counterparts. In addition, P2X7R deficiency leads to a lower incidence and lower severity of joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis38. Recently, it has become evident that P2X7R is involved in ATP release in many types of cells (astrocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, etc.)3940, and the release of ATP via the P2X7R is supposed to be an important source of extracellular adenosine41. In osteoclasts under normal conditions, efflux via the P2X7R is the primary mechanism for ATP releases40. Although exactly how up regulation of the P2X7R mediates ATP release from cells is unclear, a likely mechanism for ATP release is directly through the formation of membrane pores caused by transient activation of the P2X7R.",

Knowing that involvement of the P2X7R in ATP release has recently been reported in many cell types48, we tested the hypothesis that P2X7R function was required for the CII-induced ATP release from DCs. Our data showing that the P2X7R antagonists completely abolished CII-stimulated ATP release suggest that P2X7R mediates ATP release from DCs in response to CII. The effect of apyrase treatment on P2X7R expression strongly suggests a reciprocal relationship between the release of ATP and P2X7R function in response of DCs to CII. It has been reported that sustained stimulation of the P2X7R caused phenotypic changes, membrane permeabilization, and eventually cell death49, but we did not observe any significant cytotoxicity up to 24 h of exposure to CII. In particular, P2X7R activation also contributes to the Th17 cell differentiation. Based on these findings, we postulate that P2X7R is involved in the CII-mediated Th17 polarization.",

P2X7R activation enhances the release of Th17-biasing cytokines505152. Our data add to this observation by showing that stimulation of P2X7R by CII strongly potentiated the production of IL-1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b21, IL-23 and IL-6 mRNA. In the absence of P2X7R signaling, stimulation with CII failed to induce the upregulation of Th17-promoting cytokines in DCs. A previous study showed that stimulation of P2X7R by BzATP caused no influence on the release of L-12p7053, and Miller et al.54 found that absence of P2X7R did not affect IL-12 production. In agreement with these data, we found that CII-stimulated DCs lacking functional P2X7R still possessed the ability to promote the production of IL-12p40 and IL-12p35. In contrast, absence of the P2X7R did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production54, different from our findings in the current study. We speculated that different mediums measured in two studies may explain the discrepancy. Notably, the above results indicated that P2X7R was required for CII-induced development of a Th17-promoting rather than a Th1-promoting microenvironment. Interestingly, a study by Vergani et al.50 found that in vitro genetic upregulation of the P2X7R pathway was shown to stimulate Th1/Th17 cell generation. These findings suggest that there may be different roles of P2X7R for the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells under certain circumstances. Co-culturing system of CD4+ T cell and DCs is widely used to study the mechanisms underlying the polarization of naive CD4+ T cells in vitro55. We thus investigated the potential roles of P2X7R on the Th17 cell differentiation in this co-culturing system. Consistent with the mRNA findings, blocking the P2X7R signaling had a similar influence on the cytokine profile in the CII-stimulated coculture supernatant. The ELISA results enhanced our finding that P2X7R was necessary in the CII-mediated Th17 cell differentiation.",

A previous study showed that ATP stimulation strongly induced P2X7R expression both at the transcriptional and translational levels57. Subsequently, pores formed in response to P2X7R activation induced additional ATP release, initiating a positive feedback loop58. From the results of in vitro experiments, we have found a reciprocal relationship between ATP release and P2X7R function in response to CII, by which CII-induced P2X7R activation promote the ATP release via the formation of membrane pores, meanwhile intensified stimulation of ATP enhance the expression of P2X7R. The dynamic association between ATP release and P2X7R expression strengthens their functions against challenge with CII. As previously reported, ATP activated the P2X7R to induce cytokine responses in inflammatory conditions59. In this work, we have explored the release of six inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b21, IL-23, IL-12p40, IL-12p35 and IL-6) from DCs in response to CII. Considerable research effort has focused on the possible mechanism downstream of ATP-P2X7R for the induction of inflammatory cytokines, including NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1\u03b2 secretion60, PKC/MAPK signalling pathway for TGF-\u03b2161 and p38 MAPK pathway for IL-662. Collectively, we believe the activation of downstream signals of ATP-P2X7R axis is likely responsible for the release of inflammatory cytokines induced by CII. Further studies are needed to elucidate signalling pathways for the release of inflammatory cytokines induced by CII.",

Another study also identified B cells as a major source for rapid, innate-like IL-17 production in vivo in response to Trypanosoma cruzi infection64. P2X7R is expressed on cells of the immune system, including CD4 T cells and B cells65. However, it is still unknown whether P2X7R antagonist effect is only specific to CD4 T cells rather than B cells.

As previously reviewed, although blocking GM-CSF or its receptor has been regarded as available potent anti-inflammatory therapies, GM-CSF can act as an anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokine in many situations6667. It can increase regulatory T-cell numbers and function by modulating differentiation of DCs68. Interestingly, Gathungu et al.69 demonstrated that elevated GM-CSF autoantibody was a risk marker for aggressive Crohn\u2019s disease behavior and complications including surgery, indicating that deficiency of GM-CSF can contribute to a relative immunodeficiency. A case report by Rowin et al.70 revealed that GM-CSF treatment leaded to a sustained increase in the Foxp3 expression and an enhance capability of Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ Tregs to limit the proliferative capacities of CD4+ T effector cells. Our study showed that P2X7R presented positive effect on the differentiation of Th17 cells through its pro-inflammatory role and P2X7R inhibition attenuated joint damage of CIA mice.

In view of the potential role of P2X7R in the regulation of inflammation reported in our study and other previous studies3538414654, we believe that P2X7R may have a central role in the above immune tolerance. This could have therapeutic implications in other routes of immune tolerance in which CII is involved.",

Fortunately, several potent P2X7R antagonists are available that could be helpful for drug screening and in managing patients with RA.",
