CoVs exhibit a high frequency of recombination and high mutation rates, which may allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches (Woo et al., 2009). Currently, six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified, including, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Most HCoVs can cross species barriers, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Peiris et al., 2003; Widagdo et al., 2017).",

Some evidence demonstrates that dromedary camels are a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV, and virus from infected dromedary camels can be transmitted across species to infect humans (Azhar et al., 2014; Ling et al., 2015). Additionally, the virus can be transmitted human-to-human by close contact (Nazer, 2017). As of the 26th of January 2018, 2143 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported, and these cases include 750 deaths globally. Because no available commercial vaccines or specific treatments currently exist, rapid and accurate diagnosis is significant for the prevention of extensive MERS outbreaks.",

However, the areas in which the application of these methods are limited because the results are analyzed with electronic equipment, such as agarose gel electrophoresis set up, real-time quantitative instrumentation and turbidimeter.

Two loop primers (LF and LB) which are involved in isothermal amplification are labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and biotin, respectively. After amplification, the amplicons are simultaneously labeled with FITC and biotin. The amplicons that are labeled with biotin can bind to colloidal gold particles conjugated with streptavidin to form a complex. Then the complex, labeled with FITC, is captured by an anti-FITC antibody that is coated on the text line of the strip, and the test results are presented as a colored line that is visible to the naked eye (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is widely distributed throughout 27 countries and regions, and the numbers of annual infections and deaths continue to grow, especially in the Middle East. Because no licensed effective vaccines or treatment methods exist, timely diagnosis and isolation are the most effective methods to control viral outbreak. LAMP technology is a promising method for nucleic acid detection. Under constant temperature conditions, nucleic acids can be rapidly amplified using specific primers with advantages that include high specificities and short detection times. Currently, LAMP technology has been widely used for the detection of West Nile virus, influenza virus, yellow fever virus, Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and other virulent viruses (Kurosaki et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2013; Kwallah et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016; Chotiwan et al., 2017). In the field of MERS-CoV detection, Bhadra et al. (2015) established a real time quantitative method, i.e., a one-step strand displacement RT-LAMP, which can detect 5\u201350 PFU/ml of MERS-CoV. Shirato et al. (2014) established a real-time quantitative RT-LAMP assay for the N gene by adding pyrophosphate or nucleic acid dyes to the amplification system. Lee et al. (2016) developed a real time one-pot RT-LAMP method to target the N gene. These methods are relatively feasible, specific and rapid molecular diagnostic technologies.",

Thus, these methods are not widely applied in grassroot laboratories. In this article, an RT-LAMP-VF assay for the detection of the MERS-CoV N gene was established. In contrast with previous RT-LAMP methods, six primers are used in the reaction mixture which enormously increases the amplification efficiency. Additionally, two loop primers (LF and LB) are labeled with FITC or biotin, creating the visible results on the test strip.",

First, the RT-LAMP-VF assay requires AMV Reverse Transcriptase to reverse transcribe the RNA into cDNA. AMV Reverse Transcriptase exhibits its highest activity at 42\u201355\u00b0C, while Bst DNA polymerase operates best at 65\u00b0C. The higher reaction temperature likely decreased the efficiency of reverse transcription. Therefore, when synthesized RNA transcripts were used as the template, the temperature was lowered to facilitate reverse transcription. Furthermore, the supercoiled structures of the recombinant plasmids were steady, thus making it necessary to maintain the helix state at a high temperature.",

To investigate the efficiency of the RT-LAMP-VF assay after inserting TTTT into the FIP and BIP primers, two sets of inner primers were designed (Supplementary Table 3); one set contained the TTTT sequence and one set did not. Under the same amplification conditions, the primer set containing the TTTT sequence produced better results (Supplementary Figure 2), which is consistent with the conclusion drawn by Lee et al.

The limit of detection was equivalent to 1 \u00d7 101 copies/\u03bcl of MERS-CoV RNA for the RT-LAMP-VF, which is more sensitive than the conventional RT-LAMP reaction (1 \u00d7 102 copies/\u03bcl). Here, we observed high sensitivities, the two rRT-PCR assays detected as litter as 1 \u00d7 100 copies/\u03bcl in both the upE and N2 assays. Although the sensitivity is lower than that of the rRT-PCR, the RT-LAMP-VF assay only requires 35 min, which is far faster than the rRT-PCR assay, which requires 2 h.
