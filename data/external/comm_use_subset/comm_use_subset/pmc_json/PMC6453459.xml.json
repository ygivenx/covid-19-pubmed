Exacerbations are frequently due to extrinsic causes such as bacterial infections, viral infections, or noninfectious causes, such as medication noncompliance or environmental exposure[2, 3]. Antibiotics are not standard of care for asthma exacerbations, and several trials have shown no benefit to the use of macrolides for asthma exacerbations[4\u20137]. Despite this, 22% of patients presenting to the emergency room and 58% of patients hospitalized for asthma receive antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-related adverse events, and additional costs[8, 9]. Antibacterials and antivirals are only effective in those with confirmed bacterial and influenza infections, respectively, but it is often difficult to identify these etiologies at the point of care[10, 11].",

First, raw gene expression results were averaged normalized against two reference probes. Exploratory data analysis revealed differences between the two sample batches, which were corrected using an empirical Bayesian frameworks model[26, 27]. The normalized, batch-corrected data was used to fit a logistic regression model to perform both classification and target weight selection using the R package \u201cglmnet\u201d[28]. Specifically, we used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator for regularization and performed nested cross validation to select parameters. This resulted in three independent binary classifiers (bacterial versus non-bacterial, viral versus non-viral, and noninfectious versus infectious), which were combined into a single decision model using a one-versus-all scheme where the largest probability determines class membership. The fixed-weight model was then applied to the asthma exacerbation validation cohort to determine host-response classification. Since the asthma validation cohort was measured in an independent TLDA experiment, we included technical replicates in both training and validation TLDA experiments to evaluate and potentially correct for batch differences. In addition to this supervised analysis, we also performed dimensionality reduction on the asthmatic cohort to visualize the clustering of different groups based on infection status with respect to all 87 targets. The specific clustering algorithm utilized was T-distributed stochastic neighbor with a perplexity parameter of 10, which was implemented with the R package \u201cRtsne\u201d[29]. All scripts were written in R version 3.5.0[23].",

Therefore, discordance between clinical adjudication and model classification may have arisen from errors in either classification scheme. Most of the discordant classifications involved the bacterial subgroup, for which there are several likely explanations. The seven individuals clinically identified as having bacterial infections had no supporting microbiology. Therefore, clinical adjudications were assigned based on symptoms, physical examination, laboratory testing, and radiography, all of which poorly discriminate bacterial and viral infections[43, 44]. Radiographic abnormalities, which were the most important factor for bacterial adjudication in this study, are frequently present in viral infections[45\u201348]. Therefore, the subjects adjudicated as bacterial but classified as viral may have been true viral infections. There are other potential reasons for the observed discordance in bacterial vs. noninfectious diagnoses. The responses to bacterial and noninfectious inflammation have a large amount of biological overlap compared to the more specific interferon signaling in viral infections[16]. Consistent with this, we observed that the majority of discordance occurred between these two groups. In this scenario, a false negative bacterial infection diagnosis is of greatest concern due to the potentially missed opportunity to treat with antibiotics. Further iterations of the model will need to address rates of false negative bacterial diagnoses and the clinical cost of such errors.",

The prior success of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic use is tempered by recent studies raising some doubts.

A recent randomized controlled trial showed that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic administration did not lessen antibiotic use, due primarily to concerns that a bacterial infection was still present[15]. In contrast our gene expression-based strategy offers independent information about viral and bacterial etiologies, which may provide the necessary reassurance.",

We attempted to augment the analysis using publicly available datasets, however, the available asthma exacerbation cohorts did not include bacterial, viral, and noninfectious etiologies. Due to technical differences between our RT-PCR experiments and those in the public domain (microarray or sequencing), our fixed weight model could not be applied; a new model would need to be trained. In order to do so, all three phenotypes must be present. Future directions include the development of an asthma exacerbation-specific signature in a larger, prospectively enrolled cohort, which could also incorporate clinical variables and procalcitonin into the model. Ideally, such a cohort would have supporting microbiological evidence to provide higher confidence in clinical adjudication and allow calculation of performance characteristics. Additionally, our enrollments focused on patients with acute respiratory illness or suspected sepsis. They did not focus exclusively on patients with asthma, which may have resulted in some bias compared to a dedicated, prospective asthma study. Additionally, there is some uncertainty in a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma in the electronic medical record, a common dilemma facing emergency medicine clinicians. Another limitation was the age of our cohort. Asthma exacerbations often occur in younger individuals, but our cohort was largely adult (though several pediatric subjects were included). However, the signatures used for this study were previously evaluated in both adult and pediatric patients, showing no significant difference based on age[16]. Nevertheless, assessing performance on younger subjects with asthma, and more generally understanding the impact of age on genomic measures of the host response, is an important next step that we are currently undertaking.",

Confirmation would require a larger cohort that includes microbiologically confirmed bacterial infection or ideally, a prospective, randomized trial that uses host gene expression to guide therapy. The RT-PCR platform described in this study requires several hours of sample processing time, which is too long to meaningfully impact most clinical applications. However, further translation of this gene expression signature onto a clinically useful platform is currently underway, with current PCR-based methods yielding a time-to-result of approximately 45 minutes[50\u201352]. Gene expression-based approaches, procalcitonin, and clinical intuition all offer different strengths and weaknesses, and a combination of all may be the best approach to improve the management of asthma exacerbations.",
