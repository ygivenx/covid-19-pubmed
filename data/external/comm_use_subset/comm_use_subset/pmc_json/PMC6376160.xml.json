However, overall transmission potential for MERS is lower compared to SARS [3] and its outbreaks have been contained with much lower cumulative numbers of infected individuals than was the case for SARS. Prior studies showed that human-to-human transmission of SARS occurred via close contact and respiratory droplets [4], while that of MERS occurred via close contact only [5]. A large proportion of MERS cases were clustered in healthcare settings, most of which were contributed by unprotected close contact between healthcare workers and infected MERS patients. Previous studies have also highlighted the transmission heterogeneity between SARS and MERS. Higher transmission heterogeneity for MERS in the distribution of secondary cases than SARS highlighted the largest outbreak of MERS with sharper incidence peaks [3]. The majority of SARS cases occurred among healthcare workers; while substantial number of MERS cases were patients [3], with most MERS severe cases and mortality being individuals with comorbidities [6]. On the other hand, there were similarities between the two Co-Vs. Diseases caused by them were deadly, with a mortality rate of 29.8% for MERS [7] and 7% for SARS [8].",

Contact tracing and follow-up control measures such as quarantine and isolation were crucially important during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [10], the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014 [11], as well as its part in the eradication of smallpox [12]. With current advances in vaccine development technologies, the role of contact tracing and follow-up control measures in the initial stage of an epidemic becomes especially important. For some novel pathogens such as pandemic influenza, cutting-edge technology may shorten the time needed for vaccine development after initial isolation, bridging shorter gaps between epidemic emergence and vaccine availability [13]. Should such improvements in vaccine development occur, the potential marginal benefits of improving contact tracing processes will be substantial.",

Population-based modelling is a top-down approach depicting disease dynamics on a system level. Agent-based modelling is a bottom-up approach regarding each individual in the environment as an agent with their own movements and infection states. Population-based models are typically used for analyzing research questions from macroscopic perspectives, whereas agent-based models are good for analyzing microscopic behaviors. Agent-based approach is commonly used to implement heterogeneous and adaptive behaviors. Population-based models are usually less computationally demanding comparing with agent-based models, especially when the number of parameters incorporated in the model is large.",

In general, quarantine of all identified contacts of diagnosed infected individuals was featured in all individual-based infection dynamics models. Ideally, identified contacts are subsequently isolated for management immediately after they have been identified through regular symptom monitor assessment as symptomatic individuals. Peak et al. further considered the fractions of traced contacts who were truly infected and defined uninfected contacts to be traced for a duration up to 95th percentile of incubation period.",

Day et al. proposed a criteria for quarantine to be effective if a large number of infections were contributed by asymptomatic infection [30].

For SARS, Feng et al. noted that \u201cfinal outbreak size would have been smaller if greater proportion of exposed individuals being quarantined in theory but quarantine is exceedingly inefficient\u201d [16]. Fraser et al. concluded that \u201ceffective isolation of symptomatic individuals is sufficient to control an outbreak for SARS\u201d [19]. Chen et al. concluded that \u201ceffective isolation of symptomatic patients with low efficacy contact tracing is sufficient to control of SARS outbreak\u201d [18]. Peak et al. [15] found that \u201ccomparative effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring is strongly influenced by differences in the infection's natural history\u201d. With other intervention strategies in force, marginal benefit of quarantine was shown to be usually very low for SARS [15]. Combination of symptom monitoring with other complementary interventions, such as hand-hygiene, social distancing and protective equipment or simply isolating infected individuals only, likely controlled the diseases and ruled out the need to resort to quarantine [15,19]. For MERS, the possible substantial increase in its transmissibility resulted in difficulty in using symptom monitoring to control the disease which guaranteed the reassessment of the role of quarantine [15].",

The two tables list eleven parameters (four key epidemiological parameters and seven intervention parameters). A primary consideration in the initial stage of constructing mathematical epidemiology models is what parameters to be included in a model. The most straightforward approach is to include as many parameters as possible to reflect disease natural history, practical intervention and control measures. A more generic and complex model incorporating all major parameters provides the flexibility of manipulating different variables to simulate outcomes under various hypothetical scenarios. However, from a practical point of view, modelers should consider whether parameters featuring disease courses and interventions can be estimated from empirical or clinical data. The availability of data for parameter estimation is the central challenge for building realistic models.",

Exponential distributed incubation and infectious period were normally used to ensure greater mathematical tractability. However, some studies proposed to adopt gamma distribution instead to better describe the disease stages of SARS [27,33]. Pitzer et al. [34] suggested that models with gamma distributed infectious period were best fit to the data compared with those assuming constant transmission probability or proportional relation with viral load. The nature of memory-less free characteristics of gamma distribution ensured the biology in the transmission process to be more realistic. Previous work [[35], [36], [37]] suggested the importance of realistic distribution of these quantities facilitated more understanding in the epidemic size, the disease progression and how their distributions be adjusted in response to different intervention strategies [38]. These choices are especially relevant to models of contact tracing, as was evident in the early 2000s when two apparently similar models [39,40] came to very different conclusions about likely efficacy of contact tracing because of their different implicit assumptions about the variance of the latent period distribution.",

Six studies made such assumption [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. Fraser et al. [19] addressed this issue by pointing out this misassumption as a limitation of their model, and suggested that models incorporate this feature or alternative mechanisms [9,43] with heterogeneity transmission would give a more unbiased efficacy estimate of contact tracing. Peak et al. addressed this limitation by incorporating this factor into their model [15]. The correlation structure between infectious individuals and infected individuals for subsequent intervention measures following contact tracing should be considered.",

Public health administrators were faced with decisions and trade-offs in various resources allocation and effort prioritization along with political and social resistance. Future research questions need addressing are how many resources are required and how to prioritize the resources to contain the diseases.",

To devise appropriate decision tools for the challenges of Co-V, there are a few highlights to refine the models in future research.",

            "text": "First, understanding the epidemiology of the disease will be the top priority in response preparedness. It is key to ensure that proper data can be obtained for model construction during the early stage of an outbreak. To address this concern, public health authority should work closely with other government departments to work out accurate epidemiology data. Modelling researchers should also liaise with public health authority to ensure the required data can be obtained. Second, to reflect the real situation, future modelling studies should evaluate intervention tools under resource-constrained situations and how to allocate resources at different epidemic stages. Third, although SARS and MERS are both classified as coronavirus, the transmission heterogeneity, differences in relative exposure patterns [3] and practicability of control measures determine the optimal solutions for their containment. Geographic disparity of Ro estimate for SARS in 2003 due to different disease and community dependent transmission rate [45] highlighted the need for different levels of contact tracing approach during the epidemics. Forth, both hospital and community setting with the super-spreading events should be included in the transmission dynamics of Co-V outbreak to characterize the role of contact tracing in curbing the escalation of number of infections contributed by super-spreaders. Fifth, modelling approach can provide the condition that contact tracing effectively control the outbreak. Sometimes, politicians or health policy makers may hesitate to implement contact tracing. For example, SARS transmission in high-rise buildings among residents of Amoy Gardens suggested possible airborne transmission [46,47] and government officials were prone to political pressures regarding quarantine. With the help of mathematical models, they can decide when to adopt contact tracing if certain conditions are satisfied. Last but not least, model developers should incorporate factors regarding pre-symptomatic transmission and limited resources allocation against the epidemics at the beginning of the outbreak. Resources optimization and quarantine prioritization by target population will be the next step epidemiologists or modelers should focus on for the challenges of new emerging Co-V epidemics in the future. Two typical examples of the refinement of the current quarantine approach are household quarantine and quarantine based on residential geographic location. In addition to restricting movement in a particular geographic region and recommendation of infectious household members to stay home, other tracing approaches including identifying contacts at workplace or school can also be considered.",
