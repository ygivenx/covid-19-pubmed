Antibody-based immunotherapy against membrane TAL6 protein was used to treat breast cancer in clinical studies [6\u201312], but the therapeutic effects were limited. Several strategies are used to improve immunotherapy for cancer treatment such as induction of cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) responses to lung cancer antigens [13\u201315]. Utilization of synthetic peptides for CTL epitopes-based vaccines are safe and easy to manufacture for clinical use. Recently, the multi-peptides vaccine (IDM-2101) was designed to induce CTLs against five tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) frequently overexpressed in NSCLC (i.e. carconoembryonic antigen (CEA), p53, Her2, and melanoma antigens (MAGE)), and it provided clinical efficacy in metastatic NSCLC [16].",

Developing a convenient and predictive model to evaluate the CTL activity before clinical trials is critical and essential to increase the successful rate of immunotherapy. In this study, we generated a HLA-A2 transgenic mouse model and human tumor xenograft in SCID mice model to investigate the pre-clinical therapeutic effect of immunotherapy to human tumors via adoptive transfer of HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ CTLs recognizing human tumor antigens. Because TAL6 is a tumor specific antigen and correlates with cancer metastasis, the TAL6-derived CTL peptide was investigated to elicit tumor specific CTL responses and additive therapeutic effects with gemcitabine in pre-clinical trials.",

By using flow cytometry, high levels of TAL6 protein was detected on most of the lung cancer cell lines except NCI-H157 (Figure 1A). By comparing two cell lines from the same original cell population, we found higher TAL6 expression on CL1-5 cells with high metastatic ability as compared to parental CL1-0 cells with low metastatic ability (Figure 1A), which is consistent with previous reports that TAL6 expression on tumor cells is associated with cancer metastatic ability [21, 22]. In addition, TAL6 was detected in primary cultured lung cancer cells from lung cancer patients' pleural effusion (Figure 1B) and high TAL6 expression was maintained in human tumor xenografts in SCID mice (Figure 1C). To assess the clinical relevance of TAL6 protein expression in lung cancer patients, we performed IHC staining of TAL6 in a lung cancer tissue array, which contains 45 tumor and 55 adjacent normal tissues from Asian patients (Figure 1D). For comparison, we set a score over 0 as positive and found 60% positive staining of TAL6 in lung cancer tissues and 12.7% in normal lung tissues (Figure 1E). Notably, most normal lung tissues were in negative and the maximal score of positive staining in normal lung tissues was 1, which was only detected in paired tumors with positive staining (Figure 1F). TAL6 expression was high in lung cancer tissue but remained low in matched adjacent normal lung tissue (P < 0.0001; Figure 1F). Furthermore, to assess the diagnostic accuracy, we performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis which is used in medicine to determine a cutoff value for the TAL6 IHC result of the tissue array [23]. Area under the curve (AUC) can range from 0.5 (random chance, or no predictive ability) to 1 (perfect discrimination/accuracy). On ROC curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.75 and its sensitivity and specificity was 70.6% and 70.6% (Figure 1G), indicating TAL6 expression is indeed abundant in lung cancer tissues.",

To improve the immune-stimulatory activity of the TAL6-derived CTL epitope, we formulated peptides with adjuvant ISA (see material and method) to boost host immunity. Splenocytes from Th and A2-5 immunized A2 Tg mice were restimulated with EL4-TAL6-A2 (EL4 cells that expressed TAL6 and HLA-A2) or EL4-TAL6 (EL4 cells that expressed TAL6 alone) cells in vitro. We found a higher frequency of CD107a+CD8+ cells (cytolytic T cells) when cultured with EL4-TAL6-A2 cells (2.05 \u00b1 0.40) as compared to cultures with EL4-TAL6 cells (0.5 \u00b1 0.44). That indicated cytolytic T cells from HLA-A2 specific CTL peptides immunized mice can be activated to specifically recognize cancer cell expressed TAL6 and HLA-A2, but not to cells without HLA-A2 expression, supporting the function of HLA-A2-restricted immunity (Figure 2A). Because immunization of the A2-5 epitope could induce ex vivo CTL activity in the presence of HLA-A2, we further investigated the function of A2-5 immunization for in vivo tumor development by inoculating EL4-TAL6-A2 or EL4-TAL6 cancer cells in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. After peptide immunization, the growth of EL4-TAL6-A2 tumors was significantly suppressed compared with EL4-TAL6 tumors (Figure 2B). These results indicate that A2-5 peptide immunization can induce HLA-A2-restricted CTL responses and provide therapeutic activity in TAL6 and HLA-A2 co-expressing cancer cells.",

Splenocytes were harvested after the final immunization and T cell activation was analyzed using the IFN-\u03b3 secreting ELISPOT assay. Formulation of ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG (combination of Montanide ISA-51, A2-5 peptide, Th peptide, and TLR9 ligand CpG) induced substantial IFN-\u03b3 secretion as compared to A2-5/Th/CpG (161.1 \u00b1 18.38 v.s. 9 \u00b1 3.81) (Figure 3A). Comparison of the efficacy of each adjuvant showed that ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG induced the strongest IFN-\u03b3 secretion as compared to ISA/A2-5/Th and A2-5/Th/CpG. In addition, ISA provided greater adjuvant efficacy than CpG (Supplementary Figure S1). The ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG formulation induced more CD107a+CD8+ cells, which were activated specifically with peptide A2-5 ex vivo (Figure 3B). Consistently, ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG induced more activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells after stimulation with EL4-TAL6-A2 cells (Figure 3C). To determine whether the CTL response elicited by the peptide A2-5 can inhibit cancer metastases in HLA-A2 Tg mice, EL4-TAL6-A2 cells (2 \u00d7 104) were injected intravenously to develop a tumor metastatic animal model. No metastatic tumors in lungs were observed in ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG immunized mice at 20 days after tumor inoculation, whereas lung tumor nodules were detected in the other groups (Figure 3D). Moreover, the survival was significantly prolonged in ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG immunized mice and moderately enhanced in A2-5/Th/CpG immunized mice, compared to control mice (Figure 3E). To further detect the effect of A2-5 peptide specific TAL6-derived immunity in suppressing metastasis, melanoma B16 or B16-TAL6-A2 cells (B16 cells that expressed TAL6 and HLA-A2) were intravenously injected in na\u00efve and ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG immunized HLA-A2 transgenic mice (Figure 3F). Gross examination of whole lung specimens demonstrated that tumor metastasis to lungs were dramatically suppressed in ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG immunized mice bearing B16-TAL6-A2 tumors compared to B16 cells group. Such protection in mice was reversed in na\u00efve mice, indicating the A2-5 immunization can induce specific TAL6-derived immunity to reduce metastasis. Thus, these results suggest that ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG could induce strong HLA-A2 specific CTL responses against cancer metastases in HLA-A2 Tg mice.",

Large numbers of tumor-infiltrated CD8+T cells were detected in mice receiving control CD8+T cells, A2-5 vaccinated CD8+ T cells, and GEM combined with a peptide A2-5 vaccinated CD8+ T cells groups (Figure 6B). However, the percentage of A2-5-HLA-A2 tetramer-binding cells, which indicate the specific A2-5 derived CTLs, was greatly increased in the mice treated with both GEM and peptide A2-5 vaccinated CD8+ T cells as compared to the A2-5 CD8+ group (Figure 6C), even though the two groups had similar CD8+ T cells percentages (Figure 6B). It is likely that reduction of MDSC by gemcitabine preserved the specific A2-5 derived CD8+ T cells in tumors. These results suggest improved therapeutic application with GEM and adoptive transfer of peptide A2-5 vaccinated CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, to evaluate if the vaccine could suppress established tumors, we treated tumors after 30 days of cancer cell inoculation.

Alternatively, T cell-based immunotherapy may be a feasible approach for cancer treatment. Recently, we have identified a HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope of TAL6 that can stimulate CTL activation to kill TAL6-expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro [17]. In this study, we further extended this T cell-based immunotherapy for lung cancer treatment. TAL6 protein was previously detected with antibody in most NSCLC tissues [4], but the expression frequency of TAL6 protein in lung cancer is less reported in Asian patients. In this report, we found that TAL6 was highly expressed in over 80% of lung cancer tissues in Asian patients, suggesting thatTAL6 could be a tumor antigen. The CTL epitope A2-5 peptide induced anti-tumor effects against lung cancer in HLA-A2 transgenic mice, and adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells from peptide A2-5 immunized mice into SCID mice inhibited tumor growth of human lung cancer xenografts. More importantly, additive improvement of the therapeutic effects with T cell-based immunotherapy and gemcitabine chemotherapy was observed in a human cancer xenograft model. These results demonstrate that peptide A2-5 immunization to elicit CTL responses is feasible for lung cancer treatment.",

The deficiency of good evaluation systems for pre-clinical therapeutic studies is a major challenge for T cell-based immunotherapy assessment due to the human HLA restriction of therapeutic CTL peptides. Here, we developed a convenient model to evaluate CTL activity before clinical trials in HLA-A2 transgenic mice immunized with different formulations. ISA-51 adjuvant has been used in human clinical trials and is safer than incomplete adjuvant (IFA). We found that formulation with ISA-51, peptide A2-5, a Th epitope and TLR 9 agonist (CpG) (ISA/A2-5/Th/CpG) provided stronger anti-tumor effects than formulation with ISA/A2-5/Th. The results demonstrated that emulsion type adjuvant ISA may prolong the CpG release and enhance CTL responses. The findings are similar to our previous reports that emulsion type adjuvant PELC and PELA73 could enhance CTL responses and anti-tumor effects in the presence of CpG ODN [25, 26]. Thus, combination of emulsion type adjuvant and a TLR9 agonist is a potent formulation for peptide-based therapeutic vaccines for cancer therapy.",

The tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive cells impair CTL functions in the tumor microenvironment and are major barriers for cancer therapy. To overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment, several approaches are aimed at depleting immunosuppressive cells including antibody deletion [27], chemotherapeutic drugs [28, 29], or TLR ligand modulation [20, 30, 31]. We selected gemcitabine for combination therapy because gemcitabine has been reported to inhibit Tregs and MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment for enhancement of anti-tumor immunity [32\u201334]. We confirmed that the number of MDSCs was reduced in human tumor-bearing SCID mice treated with gemcitabine.
