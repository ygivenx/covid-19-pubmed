The IBV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that is 27.6 kb in size [2]. It encodes four major structural proteins, namely, glycosylated spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), phosphorylated nucleoprotein (N), and envelope protein (E) [3], and 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2\u2013nsp16). Generally, nonstructural proteins are present in infected cells but not in the virus, and they only play a role in the process of virus infection and replication [4]. Chickens immunized with an inactivated vaccine will produce no antibodies or low levels of antibodies against viral nonstructural proteins. Thus, nonstructural proteins have the potential application in differentiating natural infection from inactivated vaccine immunity [5].",

Virus isolation is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of IBV infection, but it is time-consuming and costly [8]. The agar gel precipitation test is used in IBV antibody detection; however, this method has low sensitivity. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are suitable for the rapid diagnosis of IB, which requires a series of methods to treat the antigen; however, the HI titer is not related to protection. The virus neutralization test correlates with protection and has the highest specificity among IB diagnostic methods, but it is tedious and laborious [9].",

            "text": "Compared with these methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been widely used for testing IBV early infection and continuous infection, and this technique can be used for both antigenic and antibody detection. The immunogenicity of the coating antigen is one of the crucial factors when performing an ELISA test for antibody detection. An inactivated whole virus is the most commonly used coating antigen in commercial diagnosis kits for IBV diagnosis. Recombinant antigenic protein expressed using prokaryotic, yeast, or baculovirus systems has been widely used in preparing specific coating antigens for ELISA kits [10\u201313]. ELISAs based on purified recombinant protein may have higher specificity and sensitivity as the target antigen is immune-dominant and devoid of any nonspecific immune responses [14]. ELISAs based on whole virus particles as well as recombinant S1 (spike protein 1 subunit) and N proteins (nucleoproteins) can provide a rapid and large-scale detection method for IBV infection. However, few IBV detection methods have been developed based on nonstructural proteins (nsps). Our laboratory has established an nsp5 ELISA to detect IBV infection [4]. The nsp5 antibodies detected are likely to be non-neutralizing and exist in lower numbers than the ones generated by other proteins. Based on previous studies, we developed a rapid, highly sensitive protein microarray and a visible detection method to detect IBV nsp5 antibodies for epidemiological investigation and antibody level monitoring.",

However, the preparation of purified virions for use as an antigen is time-consuming and expensive. In the present study, recombinant nonstructural proteins expressed in Escherichia coli antigen-based protein microarray was evaluated for the first time in the serological diagnosis of IB [4]. Protein microarrays have high sensitivity and good reproducibility in quantitative and qualitative assays, and they are a valuable asset when analyzing complex biological samples [16]. In clinical sample testing, many factors, including time, cost, accuracy, sensitivity, and throughput, determine the performance and usefulness of an immunoassay. In this study, a new solidly supported material, iPDMS membrane, which has a near \u201czero\u201d background for identification, was used. It achieved high sensitivity in detecting antibodies in serum [17]. These unique features of iPDMS not only simplify data analysis but also reduce nonspecific interactions [18]. ELISA detection has been widely used in the detection of IBV antibodies in early infection and continuous infection of IB and vaccine-immune, and no diagnosis method is more sensitive and quicker than ELISA. In this study, two microarray methods (CIT and RDT) were established. Except for the method of the observation, the reaction processes of the two methods are akin to the detection process of ELISA. However, unlike ELISA, the established methods only require 2 ng of antigen coating on each spot, and the amount of HRP-IgG required for each reaction well is only 5 ng. The antigen and HRP-IgG used in both methods were less than those used in ELISA, thereby reducing the cost of detection. In addition, the CIT can detect antibodies against IBV nsp5 quantitatively and is more sensitive than the IBV nsp5 ELISA kit. The RDT was developed to detect antibodies against IBV visually, and the results can be obtained within 15 min with great sensitivity and specificity. Compared with ELISA, RDT has a shorter detection time and better detection efficiency. In this study, we only used one antigen of IBV for testing and verification. In the future, we will apply antigens of different diseases to iPDMS to achieve high-throughput test results.",

Although protein chips have been produced in the context of proteomics research, its application is not limited to proteomics alone. With the development of protein chip technology, researchers have gradually applied this technology to other fields, such as food inspection, disease diagnosis, drug screening, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and forensic science. At present, this technology is rarely studied and applied in veterinary medicine. High throughput is an important feature of protein chips. Antibodies against several diseases can be detected from only a single serum, and this factor is especially important for clinical research, which uses precious samples from rare and wild animals. Substrate selection and surface modification, as well as new substrate research and development, have become major research foci in the field of protein chips. Our present work indicates that iPDMS can provide a matrix for the detection of antibodies in chicken serum. In addition, the high sensitivity and specificity of protein microarrays render them powerful tools in disease detection [19, 20] and enable their use for determining antibody responses to infectious diseases [21]. In the future, we will print recombinant antigenic proteins of different avian viruses to achieve high-throughput detection results with the same serum.",
