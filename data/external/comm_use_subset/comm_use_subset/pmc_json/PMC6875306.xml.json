A relationship between HBS/JHS and Clostridium perfringens type A has been established [1]. Affected cattle typically present with profound depression, dehydration, melena, as well as decreased intake decreased milk production, tachycardia, ruminal stasis, abdominal distention, and dark clotted blood in the feces. While multiple cases of this condition are reported for dairy cattle, currently there are few cases reported for beef cattle, all of which demonstrate mortality and lack of response to therapy.",

The three options for surgical management of HBS/JHS include manual clot dissolution with massage, clot removal via enterotomy, and resection and anastomosis of affected intestines. A recent report cited improved survival of surgical cases that utilized manual clot dissolution (4/4) compared to enterotomy (2/6) or resection and anastomosis (1/3) [2]. Several reports note that early surgical intervention can be effective, and factors associated with poor prognosis include puncture of the bowel during manipulation and the involvement of multiple sites within the jejunum and ileum [3]. While descriptions of HBS in the literature are predominantly dairy cattle, there are several cases in beef cattle reported in the literature. These cases range from acute presentation of sudden death [4] to unsuccessful treatment via medical management and surgical clot manipulation [2]. There are currently no reports in the literature of successful treatment of HBS in beef cattle.",

The bull had been regularly vaccinated with multivalent clostridial and respiratory disease vaccinations. The bull's diet was composed of a total mix ration (TMR), shell corn as well as pasture grazing. A month prior to presentation, the bull was caught on a gate, and meloxicam (1 mg/kg PO, q 24 \u00d7 3) was administered for mild swelling noted in the distal right pelvic limb. Three days prior to presentation to the FACH, the bull was noted to be off feed, and was administered oxytetracycline (20 mg/kg, IM, once), flunixin meglumine (2.2 mg/kg, IV, once), Vitamin B12 (5 mg/kg, IM, once), and thiamine (10 mg/kg, IM, once) by the referring veterinarian. The bull was examined by the referring veterinarian one day prior to presentation to the FACH; the complete blood count (CBC) findings were unremarkable, the serum chemistry revealed hypoproteinemia due to hypoalbuminemia and increased urea nitrogen (BUN) and strongyle-type eggs were identified on fecal flotation.",

There was one weak rumen contraction per minute and no abnormalities on percussion of the left and right abdomen. The bull was negative to withers pinch and bar (grunt) tests for cranial abdominal pain. Rectal exam revealed melena and clotted blood, and no abnormalities were palpated. The remainder of the physical exam appeared to be unremarkable. Ultrasound of the right caudal ventral abdomen was conducted with a 2\u20135 MHz curvilinear probe (SonoSite Edge II Ultrasound System, Fujifilm) and revealed hypoechoic intraluminal fluid with loops of intestines that were mildly distended with hypomotile appearance (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Liver and gall bladder appeared to be normal. Ultrasound of the ventral left thorax revealed infrequent contractions of the reticulum (1 per 3 minutes; normal: 3 biphasic contractions per 3 minutes [5]).",

            "text": "The current use of intravenous lidocaine by constant rate infusion in large animal medicine is primarily an equine treatment modality for postoperative ileus. In an equine model of ischemia and reperfusion, lidocaine was found to increase the frequency of contraction of jejunal segments in the control and experimental group both in vivo and in vitro [7, 8]. It is debated whether intravenous lidocaine improves intestinal motility by anti-inflammatory or prokinetic effects [9]. In a study of 126 horses undergoing colic surgery, there was a reduction in the development of postoperative ileus in horses that received lidocaine, and this group was 3.3 times more likely to survive to discharge than those that did not receive lidocaine [10]. It is unknown whether lidocaine had a prokinetic effect in this case, however it was well tolerated by the bull. Due to decreased plasma protein levels in this case and increased sensitivity of ruminants to lidocaine, this bull was not administered a loading dose prior to maintaining the infusion. Lidocaine toxicity in ruminant species is primarily described as neurotoxicity. The sequence of intoxication in sheep is reported as convulsion, hypotension, respiratory arrest, and finally, circulatory collapse [11]. One previous study reports the use of lidocaine intravenously to cattle with HBS, but in that study all cattle treated medically died [1]. While not commonly considered, lidocaine may possess antimicrobial properties [12, 13]. However, other studies have suggested that in humans lidocaine may attenuate the immune response by mechanisms such as suppression of oxygen metabolites and leukocyte chemotaxis inhibition [14]. Lidocaine may have a more prominent role in the future treatment of cattle with HBS.",

            "text": "Currently there are no studies evaluating the use of pantoprazole in cattle. Pantoprazole functions as a proton pump inhibitor which increases gastric pH via bonding with the hydrogen-potassium ATP-ase pump on the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. It is routinely used in canine and feline practice, and its use has been described for foals [15]. In alpacas [16], pantoprazole has been shown to increase third compartment pH when given at a dose of 1 mg/kg intravenously or 2 mg/kg subcutaneously. Among other ruminant species there are cases reporting the use of pantoprazole in a goat and a yak [6, 17]. Reported complications associated with pantoprazole in people include hyponatremia in hospitalized patients as well as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with long-term use [18, 19]. The bull in this case did not display neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or hyponatremia after commencement of pantoprazole therapy. Based on this case and other ruminant cases, pantoprazole may be a safe short-term therapy for protection of the gastrointestinal tract. The safe treatment duration of pantoprazole in cattle is unknown at this time, as increasing the abomasal pH for extended periods of time may lead to the growth of enteropathogenic bacteria. Multiple drugs in this case report, including pantoprazole, were used in an extralabel fashion. Practitioners should be aware that due to regulatory differences, extralabel use of pantoprazole may not be permissible in all countries.",

In a retrospective case series of dairy cattle with HBS, C. perfringens was cultured from the feces of 17/22 cows, and of cultures that were genotyped, 10/10 were identified as C. perfringens type A, with 5/10 having the \u03b22 toxin gene [1]. The \u03b22 toxin is responsible for inflammation of the intestine as well as partial loss of the mucosa, and the Alpha toxin, a Phospholipase C, is thought to be the primary toxin with respect to hemolysis and necrosis [2]. Genotyping in this case was positive for the Alpha toxin and negative for the \u03b22 toxin. Similarly typed isolates were collected from 5 animals in a dairy cattle case report, of which 4/5 died [2]. Antibiotics administered to cattle with HBS in previous reports include procaine penicillin G (22,000 U/kg, IM) [1, 3], ceftiofur sodium (2.2 mg/kg, IM or IV) [1], cefazolin (dose unknown, IV) [20], oxytetracycline (10 mg/kg, IV) [1, 2], or trimethoprim sulfadoxine (16 mg/kg, IV) [2]. The bull in this case report was initially treated with IV penicillin G potassium, and then transitioned to IM ampicillin when clinical signs improved and the IV catheter was removed. At the time of this publication, this is the first report to use penicillin G potassium (22,000 IU/kg IV every 6 hours) for the treatment of HBS, potentially indicating that aggressive multimodal therapy combined with intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be beneficial for HBS.",
