The virus was identified in the United States in May 2013, causing severe diarrhea and vomiting in pigs across age groups, with high mortality of up to 90\u221295 % in suckling pigs [3]. PEDV is an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family. The coronaviruses taxonomically form a subfamily (Coronavirinae) within the order Nidovirales. Recently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognized four genera within the Coronavirinae subfamily: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus [4]. PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus along with other swine viruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV).",

Sequence comparison with other European and Korean PEDV strains obtained from GenBank indicated that the NP genes were highly conserved (94.7\u221297.7 %) even though these strains originated from different geographic regions [5]. In addition to being highly conserved among PEDV variants, the NP is the most abundant viral protein expressed in PEDV infected cells [12, 13]. In contrast, the spike protein is presented on the viral surface and subject to various host immune pressures, which predisposes it to a greater range of genetic heterogeneity including insertions and deletions. Because the NP protein is highly abundant in virus infected cells, it provides an attractive target for the development of antigen-based serological assays. Taken together, this evidence provided rationale for using it as our antigen of choice for the iELISA, bELISA and FMIA.",

These assays provide an important tool in control of the virus; however, well-validated, high-throughput assays to detect antibodies following infection would provide additional valuable diagnostic tools for the swine industry. The ability to detect and evaluate antibody responses using serologic tests is important in efforts to answer basic production related questions. These questions may include whether a production site is na\u00efve or has historically experienced a PEDV exposure, even though a producer has not seen obvious clinical signs; the level of immune response sows may have in relation to vaccination, initial wild-type virus infection or intentional feedback exposure; and whether sow immunity is inadequate when clinical infection occurs in individual litters after initial PEDV exposure in a herd.",

It was subsequently directionally cloned into the E. coli, pET 28a(+), plasmid expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), then transformed into BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RP competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for protein expression. Primers used for the amplification of the full length (1323 bp) nucleoprotein were: PEDV-NP-fwd (5\u2032-CGCGGATCCATGGCTTCTGTCAGTTTTCAG-3\u2032); PEDV-NP-rev (5\u2032- CACACTCGAGATTTCCTGTGTCGAAGATCTC-3\u2032). Next, 20 \u03bcl of transformed cells were plated onto Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 50 \u03bcg of kanamycin/ml and incubated overnight. The following morning, colonies from the agar plates were added to 1 L of pre-warmed 2X yeast extract tryptone (YT) culture medium containing 50 \u03bcg kanamycin/ml and allowed to grow to an OD600 of 0.5 at 37 \u00b0C. PEDV-NP expression was induced using isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1.0 mM to induce transcription of the Lac operon, and the E. coli was allowed to incubate for an additional 8 h at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 200 RPM. The agar was strained out and bacteria pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer solution (B-PER, Pierce, Rockford, IL), incubated for 15 min at 20\u201322 \u00b0C, then centrifuged at 12,000 g to separate the soluble from insoluble proteins. The PEDV-NP recombinant protein was expressed as insoluble periplasmic inclusion bodies. The resulting 441 amino acid recombinant protein was denatured using 8 M urea, subsequently purified three times using nickel-NTA affinity column chromatography and refolded back to its native conformational state. Individual affinity column elutions were collected, pooled and confirmed by SDS-PAGE, then aliquoted/frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. The correct nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequence and restriction endonuclease analysis. The average protein yield produced by the pET28a-PEDV-NP plasmid construct was calculated to be 11 mg PEDV-NP per liter of 2XYT under the aforementioned conditions. The recombinant protein was detected and a predicted molecular weight of 51 kDa was confirmed via Western Blotting using convalescent sera, a 6X histidine-specific mAb (Novagen, Madison, WI) and a PEDV-NP specific mAb (Figs. 1 and 2).",

The medium standard generated a response of between 1.5 and 2.0 OD for the two ELISAs and approximately 10,000 MFI for the FMIA. The low standard was designed to deliver a signal slightly above threshold level for all 3 tests, and the negative serum generated an OD or MFI to a background level of less than 0.2 OD for the ELISAs and 600 MFI for the FMIA.",

Using Western blotting experiments, we confirmed the finding of Hou et al.

Blocking or competitive ELISAs have been constructed using monoclonal antibodies in PEDV serodiagnosis, and the specific methodology can affect the overall specificity and performance of the assay. Our method was based upon coating plates with highly purified NA PEDV-NP, then using a combination of two separate NA, anti- PEDV-NP specific, biotinylated, monoclonal antibodies as the blocking/competitive detection step. This allows the capture of anti-NP antibodies at higher quantities and those with a greater range of antigen specificities. The analytical specificity of the NP-based bELISA is also dependent on the affinity of the mAbs used. The antibodies used in this study are directed against conserved epitopes on the nucleocapsid protein without any evidence of cross-reactivity to any other genera of Alphacoronavirus tested. A previous assessment of antigenic cross-reactivity was performed using these same mAbs against different strains of PEDV and TGEV [7]. In that study, the authors reported that both mAbs used in the bELISA reacted with all PEDV strains tested, namely the homologous US isolate PC22A and the heterologous strains S INDEL IOWA 106, S 197DEL PC177 and CV777, at similar titers. Neither of the PEDV-NP mAbs cross-reacted with either the TGEV Miller or Purdue strains. Not only were the bELISA mAbs tested for heterologous cross-reactivity, but all three diagnostic platforms were evaluated in their ability to capture antibody against TGEV and PRCV, and there was no cross-reactivity to either heterologous virus.",

            "text": "Serology testing with IFA, iELISA, bELISA or FMIA is useful in determining whether pigs were previously infected with PEDV, or if piglets have acquired antibodies through colostrum (eg. passive antibody transfer). However, tests that evaluate the functionality of the antibodies such as the FFN are needed to determine if the detected immune response could be helpful in providing protection to nursing piglets. Neutralizing antibodies may be protective through actions including blocking uptake of the virus into cells, preventing virus binding to receptors on cells, preventing uncoating of the virus genomes in endosomes and/or causing aggregation of virus particles. For enveloped viruses, such as PEDV, lysis of the virus may also occur when antiviral antibodies and serum complement disrupt the viral membrane. For these reasons, an FFN-based virus neutralization assay was developed to assess levels of PEDV neutralizing antibodies in serum, milk or colostrum samples. The FFN provides a more rapid determination of neutralizing antibody levels than is possible with traditional virus neutralization assays that rely on visualization of virus-induced CPE after three or more days incubation to allow for full development of PEDV CPE. The direct observation of fluorescent stained infected cells, or lack of stained infected cells in the case of virus neutralization, allows for simple endpoint determination. This feature is particularly valuable when dealing with a fastidious, trypsin-dependent virus such as PEDV where CPE-based endpoints may not be obvious or may be confused with trypsin-induced CPE in the cell monolayer. Although neutralizing antibodies present in the serum would not be expected to provide direct protection from a strictly enteric infection such as PEDV, our data suggest a correlation between detectable neutralizing antibody levels in the serum and those present in milk and colostrum of previously exposed or vaccinated sows.",

FMIA are bead based assays for simultaneous high throughput detection of antibodies to multiple antigens. The FMIA differs from the ELISA since it involves a fluid incubation step with \u201cbeads suspended in solution, which allows for higher surface area exposure in 3 dimensions\u201d [30]. Therefore, there is a shorter diffusion path to antibody binding sites on the antigen coated beads resulting in rapid reaction times. Instead of a method using an enzymatic reaction such as with the ELISA, the FMIA detection is with laser technology, which results in a shorter detection time. This PEDV antigen specific bead set can be \u201cmixed\u201d with additional coated beads to other antigens, such as SIV, PCV2, PRRSV or other pathogens, for simultaneous detection of antibodies to these antigens. In addition, an FMIA could be developed for differentiation of wild-type infected vs vaccinated animals (DIVA) if proteins used in the vaccine were different from those produced in a wild-type infection.",
