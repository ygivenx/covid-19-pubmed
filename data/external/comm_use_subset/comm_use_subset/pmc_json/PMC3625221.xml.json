            "text": "There are two intriguing characteristics in quantitatively modeling infectious disease data. First, the risk of infection to an individual is dependent on the risks of other individuals in the same population unit. Second, the infection event is seldom directly observable. Among these two, the dependence has been addressed during the process of model building, e.g., a heterogeneous contact structure has been explicitly considered in various types of models [1] and sometimes by examining the conditional risk of infection at a confined setting (e.g. household). On the other hand, it has been common to address the unobservable nature of infection event by employing a convolution equation, i.e. the so-called \u201cbackcalculation method\u201d, to infer the time of infection based on the dataset of illness onset [2]\u2013[5]. However, the deconvolution procedure has been frequently dealt with as a statistical technique that is independent of the transmission model [6], and the process of model building tended to be separated from the unobservable character of infection event.",

In many instances, a temporal distribution of infected individuals (i.e. an epidemic curve) is analyzed, and most frequently, the best available dataset is the daily counts of cases. The data are usually collected based on observable information only, e.g. counts of cases according to the date of diagnosis of clinically apparent illness. Only in the better case, epidemiologists are granted an access to the daily frequency of illness onset. Nevertheless, the data generating process of the empirical information is rather different from assumed transition mechanism within the so-called SIR (susceptible-infectious-removed) model. The SIR model is considered as inconsistent with the data, because the transition from S to I state is determined by the event of infection (which is unobservable) and the other transition from I to R state is determined by the loss of infectiousness (which is even more difficult to observe) [7]. In light of a need to construct a model that better adheres to the observable information, a previous study proposed a novel modeling approach that classifies infected individuals into asymptomatic and symptomatic ones while still adopting a common multistate model structure [8]. In the case of the unobservable SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model, the model handles unobservable information within the multistate structure, classifying infected individuals into pre-infectious (exposed) and infectious individuals [7], [8] that are not directly distinguishable from each other in empirical observation.",

In the past, the contribution of asymptomatic individuals to the transmission dynamics tended to be modeled by employing the widely adopted SEIR model while splitting infectious individuals (I-class) into symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (e.g. [10]). The underlying assumptions and any potential drawbacks for employing the SEIR model on this matter have not been clarified, and thus, we would like to examine if an epidemic threshold (which yields the critical vaccination coverage) is greatly influenced by the abovementioned difference in model building approaches.",

Whereas the unobservable model in the following is a variant of the SEIR model [10], the observable model considers the transition of infected individuals based on illness onset and the disappearance of symptoms that are directly visible in the field data [8] (Figure 1A and 1B). The word \u201cobservable\u201d is intended to reflect the presence of observable symptoms (i.e. not including those observed or detected by employing laboratory testing during the asymptomatic period). Thus, the observable model might also be referred to the \u201csymptom-based\u201d model. Similarly, the unobservable model may be referred to as the \u201ccontagiousness-dependent\u201d model.",

Moreover, it is fruitful to identify different model assumptions between two models and their practical relevance to infectious disease control. Thus, here we take two different approaches to identify the structural differences and different assumptions between two models. First, we impose additional assumptions to the observable model, thereby permitting it to resemble the SEIR-like unobservable model. A simplistic analytical computation is performed to mathematically determine the difference between the two models. Second, we numerically compute the basic reproduction numbers based on the two models. It is clear, even intuitively, that the presence of pre-symptomatic transmission is a major difference between the observable model and the unobservable SEIR type model. Thus, we examine the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to the proportion of pre-symptomatic secondary transmissions among the total of asymptomatic transmissions.",

In a published study, the next-generation matrix was employed to incorporate various different biological actions of vaccination into the transmission dynamics under vaccination [12]. However, the derivation of the next-generation matrix in the published study remained heuristic, and moreover, the computation rested only on the unobservable SEIR-like model. Thus, here we derive the next-generation matrix based on the linearized system of both (1) and (6), measuring the impact of differential model formulation on the reproduction number. When analytically computing the matrix, various different effects of vaccination are considered, including not only the reductions in susceptibility and infectiousness but also the reduction in the risk of symptomatic illness [13].",

Smallpox is considered for the exposition of the similarity between two different models, because it involves very few asymptomatic transmissions [14], [25], [26]. HIV/AIDS is the opposite example of smallpox with respect to the proportion of asymptomatic transmissions among the total of secondary transmissions. Namely, the secondary transmission mostly occurs before the onset of AIDS [8]. Influenza and varicella are considered as examples that lie between smallpox and HIV/AIDS. In particular, influenza is considered, because (i) the unobservable model with asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals was initially employed with an application to influenza [10] and (ii) a variety of vaccine effects have been quantified based on challenge and community-based studies [12], which offers a suitable condition to explore the impact of model formulation on the transmission dynamics in the presence of vaccination. It should be noted that successful vaccine of HIV has yet to be offered [27] and the corresponding vaccine effect parameters were only hypothetically assumed.",

Figure 1C shows the compartments of a variant of the observable model that are intended to mimic the SEIR structure. To do this, we divide the asymptomatic infected individuals J\nA(t,\u03c4) in Figure 1A into three sub-populations, i.e., (i) pre-symptomatic individuals who are supposed to develop symptom after spending the incubation period, H\nS(t,\u03c4), (ii) asymptomatic non-infectious individuals who will not become symptomatic throughout the course of infection, H\nA(t,\u03c4), and (iii) asymptomatic infectious individuals, I(t,\u03c4). The fate of experiencing symptomatic infection is determined upon infection with a probability \u03b1, similarly to that taking place when acquiring infectiousness in the SEIR model (Figure 1B). In the following, those who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection (i.e. H\nA+I) is referred to as \u201cfully\u201d asymptomatic, while those who eventually develop symptoms, H\nS is referred to as \u201cpre-symptomatic\u201d for clarity. Recovered individuals at calendar time t is denoted by U(t). The transition rates from H\nS to J\nS, H\nA to I, J\nS to U, and I to U are \u03b7(\u03c4)/\u03b1, \u03c1(\u03c4), \u03b3\nS(\u03c3), and \u03b6\nA(\u03c4), respectively, where \u03c4 and \u03c3 again represent the infection-age and the disease-age, respectively. For consistency between the observable and unobservable models, the transition from H\ns to J\ns is artificially scaled by \u03b1, because J\ns in the observable model welcomes only the fraction \u03b1 of infected individuals to symptomatic class, which occurs not only during the transition from H\ns to J\ns but also when infected individuals enter to H\ns. The time-dependent growth of infected individuals is described by(11)\n",

Although the difference is subtle for smallpox and varicella, the critical level of influenza is clearly different between two models for influenza. Moreover, it should be noted that the critical coverage is an inverse function of the reproduction number, and a slightly greater reproduction number based on the unobservable model could incorrectly indicate us to vaccinate as many as additional 5\u201310% of the population as compared to the coverage calculated from the observable model.

First, by rewriting the observable model as if it were an SEIR-type unobservable model, we aimed to clarify underlying assumptions of the unobservable model that involves asymptomatic transmission. For the two models to be identical, we have demonstrated that it is essential that the incubation period has to be identical to the latent period and also that no pre-symptomatic transmission occurs in both models. Only the observable model can directly incorporate vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness (in the manner that the corresponding vaccine effect data is generated), and the probability of symptomatic infection in the unobservable model was shown to be multiplied to the transition rate from pre-infectious to infectious state without phenomenological justification. Second, we numerically solved both models and examined the sensitivity of R\n0 to the frequency of pre-symptomatic transmission. We identified that the ignorance of pre-symptomatic transmission in the unobservable model can lead to an overestimate of R\n0. Moreover, we have shown that the critical coverage of vaccination can be different between two models, because the vaccine efficacy of preventing symptomatic illness would influence the threshold in different mathematical manners.",

Considering a practical example of vaccination that influences the symptom onset, we have shown that the modeling approach to tackle this issue requires a model building approach that can explicitly account for the natural course of infection including asymptomatic and symptomatic states. Since the use of SEIR structure with two or more types of I-classes with different levels of symptom or clinical severity has also partially accounted for this matter of differential severity of symptom, and because the unobservable modeling approach to this issue has been proposed relatively early [10], the similar model structure has become widely adopted in a variety of settings in studying influenza and other directly transmitted infectious diseases [29]\u2013[35]. However, we have shown that the unobservable model has to inherently adopt an assumption that there is no pre-symptomatic transmission, and in this model, vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness has to influence the transition from pre-infectious to infectious state [12]. To explicitly and appropriately incorporate the vaccine effect in reducing the risk of a symptomatic disease into the model, it is fruitful to employ a model that directly accounts for disease progression.",

In fact, the observable model is not perfect, largely missing the information of infectiousness in the model structure. However, if we handle the model fitting to the incidence of illness onset, the observable model must be most useful, because the renewal equation of only symptomatic cases can be computed and directly fitted to the data [8]. If our study objective was not to quantitatively measure model parameters based on observable empirical data (e.g. model fitting to real data), the unobservable model may be more useful in many other objectives (e.g. in considering the loss of infectiousness during the isolation period). Rather than emphasizing that we should regard the observable model as a default, we would like to emphasize that writing this particular issue from multiple angles would be useful for mathematical modeling studies; the present study was a single study that focused on symptom-based modeling approach in contrast to a classical one. Moreover, it should be noted that \u201ctheoretically\u201d the best model in this context would be the one that accounts for both observable and unobservable information within a single model. Such a model can easily address the dependence structure between clinical illness and infectiousness [36], and indeed, the potential dependence and difference between the incubation period and the latent period are known as critical factors in determining the effectiveness of public health interventions including contact tracing and case isolation [9], [37]\u2013[39]. As demonstrated by animal experiments for foot and mouth disease [38], an appropriate combination of well-designed experiments (or observations) and statistical inference could shed light on the scientific approach to (i) considering both illness and infectiousness and (ii) identifying ideal modeling strategy in the future [40].",

The compartment of an unobservable model. The model describes the transitions depending on acquirement or disappearance of infectiousness. Upon infection, infected individuals experience the latent period (i.e. Exposed compartment (E)) after which each acquires infectiousness and is classified as either symptomatic (I\nS) or asymptomatic (I\nA) one. C. The compartment of the special case of the observable model. The model describes the transitions based on symptoms, but partially accounts for infectiousness too. To let it be similar to model B, we decomposed asymptomatic individuals, J\nA of the observable model (panel A) into pre-symptomatic individuals, H\nS and fully asymptomatic individuals with or without infectivity.

The solid line shows the reproduction number of the unobservable model under vaccination. The dashed line shows the reproduction number of the observable model under vaccination. Except the vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness, all parameters were fixed (see Table? 1).
