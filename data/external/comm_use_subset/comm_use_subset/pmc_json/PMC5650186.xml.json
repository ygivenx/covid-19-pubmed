Since the first report in the United States in 1974, EV71 outbreaks have been reported around the world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years [2]. In China, EV71 caused a severe HFMD outbreak in Fuyang, Anhui province in 2008, and has since become an epidemic problem [3]. The frequency and severity of HFMD have shown an increased annual trend and pose a serious threat to children\u2019s health and social stability in China [4]. However, no effective therapy is currently available for the treatment of this infection and more studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of EV71.",

Among these viral proteins, viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro have been demonstrated play important roles in virus-host interaction and EV71 pathogenesis. EV71 2Apro has been reported to hijack host cell gene expression by cleaving the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [4,6\u20138]. It has also been reported to antagonize host innate immunity by down-regulating interferon receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) [4,9]. EV71 3Cpro has been reported to mediate viral immune-evasion by targeting many key components in host innate immunity, including TRIF, IRF7, IRF9, and the RIG-I/IPS-1 complex [5,10\u201313]. Moreover, 3Cpro has also been reported to disrupt host cell gene expression by cleaving CstF-64 [14].

            "text": "ERAD is a process that facilitates the degradation of terminally misfolded, misassembled, and metabolically regulated proteins in the ER by retro-translocating them to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system [16,17,28,29]. This process consists of four coupled steps: (i) substrate recognition; (ii) retro-translocation; (iii) ubiquitination; and (iv) 26S proteasome-mediated degradation [16,30,31]. Since ERAD is a key cellular machinery for ensuring correct cell function, it is unsurprising that viruses can manipulate this process for their own benefit. Previous studies demonstrated that different viruses can affect and exploit the ERAD process in different manners [28,31\u201334]. There are four reasons why viruses exploit ERAD. First, to escape the immune surveillance system by eliminating immune molecules; examples include herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [28,32]. Second, viruses take advantage of ERAD to achieve the membrane penetration of intact viruses from the ER to the cytosol, such as simian virus 40 (SV40), human BK virus, and murine polymavirus [28,32]. Third, viruses promote ERAD tuning and hijack EDEMosomes to support their replication, including coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [32,35\u201337]. Finally, viruses can activate ERAD to degrade viral glycoproteins and thereby reduce the viral particle and maintain a chronic infection status; examples include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [32,38,39]. However, despite the numerous studies mentioned above, no reports have investigated the relationship between picornaviruses and ERAD.",

These biological processes are exploited by various infectious pathogens as survival and proliferation strategies [21,28]. Our previous study also demonstrated that EV71 can take advantage of host autophagy for its own proliferation [27]. However, it remains unknown whether EV71 can affect and modulate the host ERAD machinery. To address this question, we first categorized the ERAD substrates according to their different chaperone systems and established stable cell lines ectopically expressing these substrates. There are two types of ERAD substrate according to their varied chaperone system: calnexin (CNX)/calreticulin (CRT)-dependent substrates and BiP-dependent substrates [16,40,41]. The different types of substrate may be disposed by distinct ERAD sub-pathways and different molecules may be involved.",

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells stably expressing SHH and NHK were mock infected or infected with EV71 and treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) for different times (according to their pre-tested half-life). Western blotting was then used to measure the expression of the substrates. The levels of both SHH-C and NHK were gradually decreased in CHX-treated mock-infected cells in a time-dependent manner.

Transthyretin D18G (the 18th D amino acid mutated to G; TTR D18G) and non-secretory immunoglobulin kappa-type light chain (NS1 \u03ba LC) were selected as representative. TTR is a non-glycosylated soluble secretory protein and TTR D18G is the most destabilized mutant of TTR that is subject to ERAD [48,49]. NS1 \u03ba LC is an unassembled immunoglobulin light chain that is degraded through ERAD [50]. RD cells stably expressing TTR D18G and NS1 \u03ba LC were treated with CHX and their degradation was assessed. The degradation of both substrates was remarkably inhibited in a time-dependent manner during EV71 infection (Fig 1C and 1D), suggesting that EV71 infection also inhibits the ERAD of BiP substrates. It is worth noting that high molecular weight bands of TTR D18G were visible (Fig 1C), which we demonstrated were glycosylated forms of TTR D18G by treating cell lysates with glycosidase PNGase F (S2 Fig). In EV71-infected cells, the molecular weight of glycosylated TTR D18G was decreased, and we speculate that is due to extensive mannose trimming.",

First, SHH-C was used as the substrate. SHH-C is a glycosylated protein that undergoes deglycosylation when retro-translocated to the cytosol. The accumulation of deglycosylated SHH-C when the proteasome is inhibited reflects its retro-translocation degree [43\u201345]. In cells not treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the deglycosylated SHH-C was not detected in either mock- or EV71-infected cells. However, when cells were treated with MG132, deglycosylated SHH-C was visible as a low-molecular weight band in mock-infected cells, but was barely detectable in EV71-infected cells (Fig 2A). This suggests that the retro-translocation of SHH-C was inhibited by EV71 infection and that SHH-C could be trapped inside the ER lumen.",

            "text": "To further confirm the above conclusion, a previously reported dislocation-dependent reconstituted GFP (drGFP) assay was used to evaluate different substrates, and the principle of this system is illustrated in Fig 2B. Briefly, the GFP molecule is split into two fragments: the C-terminal \u03b2-strand (S11) and the remaining 10\u03b2 strands (S1\u201310). The S11 is linked to ERAD substrates expressed in the ER lumen, and S1\u201310 is expressed in the cytosol. When S11-tagged substrates are retro-translocated into the cytosol, S11 is reassembled with S1\u201310, and the resulting GFP signal is detected when the coupled proteasome degradation is inhibited (Fig 2B) [52]. First, the drGFP assay was used to determine the location of SHH-C in EV71-infected cells. The results showed that in cells not treated with MG132, no GFP signal was observed in either mock-infected or EV71-infected cells. However, the reconstituted GFP signal could be detected in MG132-treated mock-infected cells, but not in EV71-infected cells (Fig 2C). This suggests that EV71 inhibited the retro-translocation activity of SHH-C and that this substrate was trapped inside the ER during infection. The same method was also used to test the retro-translocation activity of NHK and TTR D18G during EV71 infection, and similar results were obtained (Fig 2D and 2E). The drGFP assay was not used to evaluate substrate NS1 \u03ba LC since previous studies reported that NS1 \u03ba LC was retained in the ER lumen and not translocated to the cytosol when cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor [53]. The above experiments were performed with RD cells expressing different substrates infected with EV71 up to 18 h, and we also used flow cytometry to monitor cell apoptosis under this situation. The results showed that EV71 infection for 18 h caused apoptosis in 30.4% cells, and combined treatment with MG132 in the last 8 h slightly downregulated this proportion (S3 Fig).",

Since different substrates are degraded through distinct sub-pathways, it is likely that EV71 inhibits ERAD at multiple targets or at one shared key point. To clarify the specific molecular mechanisms, ERAD-related molecules were categorized by their different functions and a kinetic study was performed to measure their expression during EV71 infection. The molecules examined were classified into four categories: (1) recognition factors (calnexin, calreticulin, BiP, EDEM1, OS9, and XTP3-B); (2) retro-translocation factors (SEL1L, Herp, Derl1, and Derl2); (3) ubiquitination factors (Hrd1, gp78, RNF5, Ubc6e/UBE2J1, and Ubc7/UBE2G2); and (4) proteasomal degradation factors (VIMP, UBXD8, p97, Ufd1, and Npl4) [16,30,31] (Fig 3A). As expected, EV71 infection downregulated the expression of several molecules in a time-dependent manner, including Herp, Hrd1, Ubc6e, VIMP, and UBXD8 (Fig 3B). Among these, two bands that seemed like cleavage products of Ubc6e could be detected around 25\u201326 kDa in molecular weight, and their intensity increased as the infection proceeded. Cleavage bands were also detected in the blot of UBXD8, but not in the blots of Herp, Hrd1, and VIMP (Fig 3C).",

Ubc6e forms an E2-E3 pair with Hrd1 and is considered the principal E2 in cellular ERAD [54\u201356]. To further clarify the precise mechanism by which Ubc6e is cleaved, we investigated whether EV71-encoded viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro participate in this process. These viral proteases are responsible for cleaving poly-protein precursors to obtain mature viral proteins, and increasing amounts of evidence have demonstrated that they could cleave various host factors to facilitate viral replication [1,4,5,13]. First, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EV71 3Cpro or a protease-dead mutant of 3Cpro (C147S), and Ubc6e cleavage was detected by western blotting. Overexpressed 3Cpro, but not 3Cpro(C147S), could cleave Ubc6e in a dose-dependent manner, and the cleavage bands were the same molecular weight as in EV71-infected cells (Fig 4A). This result was also achieved by in vitro cleavage assay with recombinant 3Cpro and its protease-dead mutant 3Cpro(E71A) (Fig 4B). We also tested the role of 2Apro in Ubc6e cleavage, and the result showed that no cleavage bands were detected in 2Apro-transfected cells (S5 Fig). This suggests that EV71 3Cpro cleaves Ubc6e during infection.",

The results showed that SHH-C degradation was inhibited gradually with the increasing expression of EV71 3Cpro (Fig 4C). However, the inhibitory effects were not as potent as EV71 infection. This might be due to the limited transfection efficiency of the overexpressed EV71 3Cpro, or it could be because Ubc6e cleavage is only one of the factors that inhibit ERAD, and other factors could also be involved. Overall, this result suggests that EV71 3Cpro-induced Ubc6e cleavage could be a crucial mechanism by which EV71 inhibits ERAD.",

The results showed that the ~25\u201326 kDa cleavage bands could be recognized by the Ubc6e antibody but not the FLAG antibody (Fig 4D), indicating that these cleavage bands were N-terminal cleavage fragments from Ubc6e. The molecular weight of the cleavage fragments suggested that the cleavage sites might be located at the region of amino acids 200\u2013300 of Ubc6e (Fig 4E). Since picornavirus 3Cpro preferentially cleaves glutamine-glycine (Q-G), glutamine-alanine (Q-A), and glutamine-serine (Q-S) bonds in viral polyproteins and cellular targets [11,57], a panel of site-directed mutants with Q mutated to A within the 200\u2013300 amino acid (aa) region was constructed. Then, 293T cells were co-transfected with the GFP-3Cpro and Ubc6e/Ubc6e mutants to map the cleavage sites. As illustrated in Fig 4F, all the mutants could be cleaved by 3Cpro as before. However, the cleavage bands from mutant Q219A were shifted to a molecular weight of ~30 kDa (Fig 4F). This indicates that the 219th glutamine of Ubc6e (Q219) is one of the cleavage sites and that another cleavage site(s) exists that is located closer to the C-terminus of Ubc6e. To further identify the remaining cleavage sites, a new panel of double-site mutants (Q to A) was constructed within the 219\u2013300 aa region based on the Q219A mutant. These series mutants revealed that all the double-site mutants could be cleaved by 3Cpro; however, the cleavage bands were changed in cells transfected with mutant Q219Q260A and Q219Q273A. This indicates that both Q260 and Q273 are the cleavage sites of 3Cpro on Ubc6e (Fig 4G). To further confirm this result, a third round of screening was conducted using triple-site Q to A mutants that were generated based on Q219Q260A including Q219Q260Q262A and Q219Q260Q273A. The results showed that triple-site mutant Q219Q260Q273A was totally resistant to 3Cpro cleavage; thus, Q260 and Q273 were identified as the second and third cleavage sites (Fig 4H). Taken together, the above results demonstrate that EV71 3Cpro cleaves Ubc6e at Q219G, Q260S, and Q273G. These sites are all located on the cytoplasmic side of Ubc6e, and cleavage at these points will lead to the release of the E2 catalytic domain of Ubc6e into the cytosol and inactive Ubc6e at the ER membranes. When all the cleavage sites were identified, we re-analyzed the results of Fig 4E\u20134G and speculated that each cleavage fragment was accompanied by a phosphorylated form with a lower migrating speed [58,59]. We also confirmed this by treating cell lysates with phosphatase and detected the cleavage of Ubc6e; the results showed that both the dual-band of Ubc6e and cleaved Ube6e changed to a single-band when treated with phosphatase (Fig 4I).",

Herp, whose expression is strongly induced by the unfolded protein response (UPR), is involved in the turnover of ERAD substrates [60\u201362]. It participates in building the dislocation machinery around Hrd1 and itself has a very fast turnover [44,63\u201365]. To further explore the reason behind the Herp reduction, we first assessed whether the reduction of Herp was caused by accelerated degradation or blocked synthesis. Mock- and EV71-infected RD cells were treated with the ER stress inducers thapsigargin (Tg) and tunicamycin (Tun) to induce Herp expression, and the degree of upregulation was compared between mock- and EV71-infected cells. Tg and Tun could induce Herp expression efficiently in mock-infected cells, especially when the cells were treated with ER stress inducers combined with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. However, the same treatment induced less Herp expression in EV71-infected cells, implying that EV71 infection may inhibit the de novo synthesis of Herp and that Herp is degraded via proteasomal degradation (Fig 5A). Cell apoptosis in EV71-infected cells and infected cells combined with different chemical treatments as shown in Fig 5A were also checked, and no obvious differences were observed between different groups (S6 Fig).",

To test this hypothesis, the impact of EV71 on mRNA transcription was checked. Mock- and EV71-infected RD cells were treated with Tg and Tun, and Herp mRNA expression was assessed using real-time PCR. Tg and Tun induced Herp expression efficiently in mock-infected cells, but the extent of upregulation was reduced by 2/3 in EV71-infected cells. However, there were no differences of basal Herp expression between mock- and EV71-infected cells (Fig 5B). This suggests that EV71 might inhibit basal Herp synthesis at the translational level and inhibit Tg- and Tun-induced Herp synthesis at both the transcriptional and translational levels.",

Therefore, we assessed whether EV71 2Apro blocked the protein synthesis of Herp in a previously reported BSRT7 cell line that stably expresses T7 RNA polymerase and effectively avoids the difficulties in expressing 2Apro in eukaryotic cells [4,8,66]. Using GFP and 2A protease-dead mutant 2A(C110A) as the control, Tg and Tun induced Herp expression to a much weaker extent in 2A-transfected cells compared with control cells (Fig 5C), suggesting that EV71 2Apro could inhibit Herp synthesis.",

It is an important component of the ERAD complex because it can recruit p97 and other cofactors to the ER membrane for retro-translocation [67\u201369]. A CHX chase assay revealed that VIMP is a short-lived protein, similar to Herp (S4 Fig). Therefore, it is possible that EV71 inhibits VIMP and Herp expression via a similar mechanism. To confirm this, the BSRT7 cell line was transfected with EV71 2A, and VIMP expression was monitored at both the mRNA and protein levels. The results showed that there were no differences of VIMP mRNA expression between GFP and 2A-transfected cells (Fig 5D). However, the protein expression of VIMP was significantly downregulated in 2A-transfected cells, but not GFP and 2A(C110A)-transfected cells at the protein level, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 5E), suggesting that the EV71 2Apro also inhibits the protein synthesis of VIMP.",

            "text": "To clarify the significance of EV71 inhibiting cellular ERAD, we first examined whether key ERAD components could impact the lifecycle of EV71. Although Ubc6e and Herp are viral targets of cellular ERAD, our above results showed their knockdown did not change viral protein expression in infected cells (Fig 6A\u20136E). So we further checked the viral RNA in Ubc6e or Herp knockdown cells, and the result showed that viral RNA replication was not affected by their knockdown (Fig 7A). Then we used siRNA to silence different ERAD components besides of Ubc6e and Herp and checked their role in EV71 replication. The results showed that the depletion of ATPase p97 remarkably inhibited EV71 replication, and the depletion of p97 cofactor Npl4 had a slight inhibitory effect (Fig 7B). This suggests that the p97 complex, and especially p97 itself, is a critical host factor that is required for EV71 replication. To further explore whether the ATPase activity of p97 is required for EV71 replication, N2, N4-dibenzylquinazoline-2, 4-diamine (DBeQ), a reversible small molecule inhibitor, and p97 dominant negative mutant (p97QQ) [52,72], were used. Pretreating RD cells with DBeQ and transfecting RD cells with p97QQ remarkably attenuated EV71 infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 7C and 7D), suggesting that ATPase activity is required for EV71 replication.",

To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the distribution of p97 is changed by multicolor fluorescent confocal microscopy. The distribution of p97 had changed significantly in EV71-infected cells; the original evenly distributed pattern had changed to a non-uniform state, and most p97 accumulated around the wrinkled nuclei. In addition, p97 co-localized with EV71 2C (Fig 7E), suggesting that p97 and 2C jointly participate in EV71 replication. Next, endogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in EV71-infected cells with p97 antibody, the results showed 2C immunoprecipitated by p97 antibody but not control IgG (Fig 7F), indicating p97 and EV71 2C protein may interact in infected cells. Since 2BC and 3AB protein of poliovirus were also reported interact with p97 [73], the interaction of p97 and 2C we observed in EV71 infected cells may be indirectly and mediated by other viral proteins. To test this possibility, exogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments were further performed in 293T cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged EV71 2C protein and Flag-tagged p97 protein. The results showed that p97 also co-immunoprecipitated with 2C (Fig 7G), indicating p97 and 2C could interact with each other with no aid of other viral proteins. However, these results cannot exclude the possibility that other viral proteins also interact with p97.",

The ROs of picornaviruses have been reported to formed at ER-Golgi interface, and utilize host factors including phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III\u03b2 (PI4KB), ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), and Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) [74,76\u201379]. To test whether similar ROs also formed in EV71-infected cells, we first checked whether the above-mentioned host factors are also involved in the lifecycle of EV71 by siRNA knock-down. The results showed that knocking down either PI4KB or ARF1, but not GBF1, inhibited EV71 propagation (Fig 8A), suggesting that EV71 induced similar but not exactly the same ROs as other picornaviruses. Next, immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess whether the intracellular distributions of PI4KB, ARF1, and GBF1 had changed in infected cells and whether p97 and EV71 2C co-localized with these factors. PI4KB, ARF1, and GBF1 all redistributed to the perinuclear region of infected cells and co-localized with p97 and 2C (Fig 8B and 8C). To further demonstrate that the site of co-localization with the host factors p97 and 2C are the ROs of infected cells, co-localization assays were performed between PI4KB-p97-2C and PI4KB-ARF1-p97. All three molecules co-localized in the perinuclear region (Fig 8D and 8E), suggesting that the aggregation foci of p97 and 2C in the perinuclear region were actually viral ROs.",

EV71 then hijacks host factor p97 and utilizes ER-derived membrane components from the disabled ERAD machinery to form its own replication organelles. In this study, we found that EV71 viral protein expression and viral RNA replication did not change in Ubc6e or Herp knockdown cells, although degradation of ERAD substrates was inhibited. We thought this was because the damage to ER caused by Ubc6e or Herp knockdown was relatively mild when compared to EV71 infection, and the ER membranes were not rearranged under this situation. However, in EV71 infected cells, ERAD was inhibited at multiple points, and ER homeostasis suffered serious damage. This will inevitably cause changes to ER and lead to membrane rearrangement, allowing viruses to take advantage of ER membranes and ER-related host factors more conveniently [76,85].",

            "text": "During ERAD, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and E3 ligase work cooperatively to ubiquitinate substrates. To date, three E2s (Ubc6e/UBE2J1, UBE2J2, and UBE2G2) and five principal E3s (Hrd1, gp78, RMA1, TEB4, and TRC8) have been identified in the mammalian ERAD system [29,54\u201356,87]. Among these, Hrd1 forms an E3-E2 pair with Ubc6e and gp78 forms an E3-E2 pair with UBE2G2. These two E3-E2 pairs are considered the main executors of substrate ubiquitination in ERAD and they have distinct substrate specificities that are determined by the E3s [56]. The current results revealed that EV71 infection caused both Ubc6e cleavage and Hrd1 downregulation and thus totally destroyed the Hrd1-Ubc6e E3-E2 pair. We also investigated the gp78-UBE2G2 pair, but there were no obvious changes in these two molecules during EV71 infection (Fig 2B), indicating that the Ubc6e-Hrd1 E2-E3 pair is the key ubiquitination element targeted by EV71 during infection. We attempted to reconstitute a functional ERAD system in EV71-infected cells by co-transfecting cells with a 3Cpro-resistant mutant of Ubc6e (Q219Q260Q273A) and WT Hrd1. However, this could not rescue the inhibited ERAD process (S8 Fig), suggesting that EV71 inhibits ERAD in a comprehensive manner that involves multiple factors. The decrease of Hrd1 and the cleavage of UBXD8 found in our study are examples. We also checked the role of EV71 2Apro and 3Cpro in the cleavage of UBXD8 but the results excluded their role (S4 Fig) and our future work will focus on the specific mechanisms.",

Knockdown of Ubc6e by siRNA inhibited the degradation of all ERAD substrates we tested. However, in one recent study, Hagiwara et al. reported accelerated degradation of NHK in Ubc6e\u2212/\u2212 cells because Ubc6e could downregulate ERAD enhancers [88]. This discrepancy might be caused by the different silencing efficiencies of the methods used by the two groups. We used siRNA to knock down Ubc6e while Hagiwara et al. used Ubc6e knock-out MEFs. As described by Hagiwara et al. themselves, very little UBC6e suffices to properly regulate ERAD enhancers [88]. When using siRNA, knockdown of Ubc6e was not complete, and the remaining Ubc6e was sufficient to maintain the proper expression level of ERAD enhancers. Moreover, in Ubc6e\u2212/\u2212 cells, other E2s may compensate in the Hrd1 complex and substitute Ubc6e to degrade ERAD substrates.",

            "text": "Okuda-Shimizu et al. and Kny et al. reported conflicting results about the role of Herp in the degradation of different substrates [42,50]. The current study explored the involvement of Herp in different ERAD pathway and the results are consistent with Kny and colleagues. Specifically, Herp was involved in the ERAD of the BiP substrates NS1 \u03ba LC and TTRD18G and the calnexin substrate NHK, but not another calnexin substrate SHH-C. This suggests that other signatures but not the binding chaperone and glycosylation determine the substrate specificity of Herp. As a critical constituent of ERAD, its turnover is mediated by ERAD tuning, and this is a strategy by which Herp can regulate ERAD [64,89]. A previous study demonstrated that UBE2G2-gp78 is responsible for Herp degradation during the recovery from ER stress [63]. However, the mechanism by which Herp is degraded under physiological conditions is unknown. In the current study, Ubc6e was identified as the key E2 that participates in Herp degradation since silencing Ubc6e increased the intracellular levels of Herp (Fig 6A\u20136E) and silencing UBE2G2 had no effect (S9A Fig). We also tried to identify the E3 partner of Ubc6e that participates in Herp degradation. Although the candidate E3s included Hrd1, gp78, and RNF5, we unfortunately could not draw a definite conclusion because Herp was not upregulated when any of them were silenced (S9A\u2013S9C Fig). Nevertheless, we speculate that Hrd1 is involved in the degradation of Herp because overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of Hrd1 (C329S) increased Herp expression compared with WT Hrd1 (S9D Fig). However, it is unclear why silencing Hrd1 had little impact on Herp whereas overexpressing Hrd1 dramatically increased Herp levels. We postulate that Hrd1 and its association with Herp is a key determinant of intracellular Herp expression. Specifically, when Hrd1 is silenced Herp is downregulated, but when Hrd1 is overexpressed Herp is upregulated. Future studies are needed to verify this hypothesis and clarify the specific mechanism by which Herp is degraded.",

In addition, Wu et al. identified p97 as a cellular factor involved in EV71 replication using a genome-wide RNAi screen [92].

This study supports the role of p97 in the viral lifecycle and discloses the origin of the p97 that participates in the formation of ROs. However, it remains unclear how p97 functions in ROs.

However, EV71-induced ROs we observed under electron microscopy included both single- and double-membrane vesicles, and most were single-membrane vesicles. We also checked the distribution of EDEM1 in EV71-infected cells, and the results showed that it did not change during EV71 infection (S10 Fig).
