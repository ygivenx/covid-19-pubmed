We\ncannot consider the leg ulcers as the primary local ATL infection since they were\nnot biopsied and they were initially considered as vascular stasis-related lesions,\nemphasizing the difficulty in diagnosing ATL, even for experienced specialists\n1\n. (b) Immunological local features indicated a deficiency in innate response,\nbut a strong Th1 response with an intense pro-inflammatory activity. Furthermore,\nthe lack of regulatory response leads to severe local damage, which explains the\natypical skin lesion. Regulation deficiency may be explained not only by the\nimmunosuppressed patient conditions (chronic hepatopathy) but also by\nLeishmania sp. local immunomodulation\n6\n\n,\n\n7\n. On the contrary, parasite exposure and a deficient cellular activity lead\nto an intense humoral response with high titers of anti-Leishmania circulating\nantibodies, confirmed by great titers of IFI and ELISA. (c) Following the Brazilian\nMinistry of Health VL guidelines\n4\n, this patient met the criteria to confirm the diagnosis of VL; however, with\nthe patient\u2019s comorbidities (cirrhosis with portal hypertension) and ATL, the\nclinico-laboratory interpretation was significantly harder. Moreover, rK39\nfalse-positive test supported the misdiagnosis, ruling out postmortem VL. The rK39\ntest is a valuable tool for VL diagnosis\n8\n, showing a good accuracy depending on the test brand and the global region\nused\n9\n. However, some rK39 rapid test brand had shown excellent performance in the\nblood from Brazilian patients\n10\n; its results should be carefully analyzed in co-prevalent regions with ATL\ndue to an eventual cross-reactivity\n3\n, as observed here, even in bone marrow samples. Regarding surveillance, VL\nnotification had to be removed. (d) Otherwise, considering the patient\u2019s\nimmunosuppression and the high incidence of VL in Southeastern Brazil, these\natypical lesions may also be explained due to the cutaneous involvement by\nviscerotropic Leishmania strains\n11\n.",
