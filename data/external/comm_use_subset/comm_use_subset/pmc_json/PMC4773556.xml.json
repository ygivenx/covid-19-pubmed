Indeed, a foreign body is literally placed into the blood flow, which constantly contacts with blood cells and surrounding tissues and could eventually cause inflammatory and, perhaps, autoimmune reactions. Character and intensity of such reactions are subject to thorough investigation in order to, on one hand, select proper prosthetic heart valve and, on the other hand, develop approaches for improving prostheses and preventing complications and their dysfunctions. Previously, it was found that biological compared to mechanical prostheses may cause inflammatory complications [1]. Despite this, other data from long-term studies revealed no significant differences between biological and mechanical prostheses in terms of subsequent complications [2].",

Infiltrates consisted of macrophages and lymphocytes including B and T cells. During the study, it was concluded that T cells responded to implanted foreign porcine tissues with development of significant damage of host aortic wall. It is assumed that inadequately fixed tissues of porcine aorta resulting in subsequently retained antigenicity might be one of potential causes of developing inflammation [6]. A hypothesis is confirmed regarding causes underlying development of immune reactions against implanted biological tissue related to residual antigens of animal origin retained despite special treatments and decellularization [7, 8].",

As early as in 1988 it was demonstrated that CD45R (now known as CD45RA) protein may be considered as a marker for na\u00efve or unprimed T cells, whereas UCHL1 antibody recognizing CD45R0 binds to memory T cells [9]. Currently, it is known that na\u00efve T cells express CD45 molecules containing all domains within its sequence; however, starting from antigen-specific differentiation maturing T cells begin to express their isoforms resulting from mRNA splicing within exon A followed by exons B and C. Gene product containing all these domains is known as CD45RA (molecular weight 220 kDa), whereas the product derived after final RNA modification and lacking all such domains is denoted as CD45R0 (180 kDa). Currently, functional significance of various CD45 isoforms remains poorly investigated, which is not true for the rest of surface markers used for phenotyping main stages of maturing T cells [10].",

The latter subset bears adhesion molecules responsible for cell migration into body peripheral tissues. Currently, it is considered that both CD62L and CCR7 markers determine migration of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood. By staining for CCR7 and CD62L molecules on the cell surface it allows to denote na\u00efve and central memory T cells within the pool of circulatory T lymphocytes [12]. Lack of such surface markers on effector T cells\u2014effector memory and terminally differentiated effector T cells (TEMRA)\u2014is accounted for by the fact that these cell subsets function within nonlymphoid tissues.",

The main difference of this T cell subset from na\u00efve T cells is that they have already passed through antigen-specific differentiation that occurred within the secondary lymphoid tissues. Presence of CD62L on the surface of these cells allows to distinguish them from effector memory T cells with phenotype CD45RA\u2212CD62L\u2212. This feature of Tcm allows them to circulate around the body for a long period of time and determines their preferential location inside the secondary lymphoid tissues. Upon antigenic stimulation, antigen presenting cells possessing cognate surface ligands allow to rapidly activate T cells with high expression level of CD27 and CD28 followed by successful formation of antigen-specific T cell clones [13]. Moreover, central memory T cells better secrete IL-2, whereas effector memory T cells are more effective in synthesizing effector cytokines [14].",

Importantly, a more pronounced rejection reaction was against biological prostheses. It seems that despite special treatment of biological material in graft tissues, quite a large amount of xenogeneic tissue antigens still remains (swine valve apparatus). T cells and monocytes become stimulated by foreign antigens that also provoke their migration into donor tissues and in situ activation resulting in release of huge amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. In particular, a whole set of such biologically active molecules may display proosteogenic activity not only supporting local inflammatory reaction, but also leading to collagen degradation and deposition of hydroxyapatites. Altogether, local inflammatory and degenerative changes within prosthetic tissues may result in prosthesis dysfunction [19].",
