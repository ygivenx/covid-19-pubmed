To assess factors associated with lung adenocarcinomas, a gene expression study comparing normal lung tissue and lung tumor was undertaken using the HG-U133A Affymetrix gene chip [1]. While such associations do not establish causation, they characterize the underlying molecular marks or tumors and identify potential target sites for treatments. To ascertain if the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is altered in lung adenocarcinomas we evaluated the expression of 15 genes of the classical RAS (Figure 1) and extended components of the RAS as reported in a previous study [2].",

For example, Angiotensin II (Ang II), the primary hormone of the RAS, promotes the proliferation of mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells (but not SV40 transformed 3T3 cells in culture) [3], DNA synthesis and proliferation of adrenal cortical cells in culture [4], and the hypertrophic and hyperplastic growth of vascular smooth muscle cells [5]. Both myointimal hyperplasia and vascular smooth muscle DNA synthesis are increased in rats infused with Ang II [6]. All these proliferation-promoting effects of Ang II suggest that the RAS might play a critical role in cancer [7\u201310].",

            "text": "Canonically, most studies suggest that Ang II acting via the AT1 receptor can promote cancer by a variety of mechanisms. Ang II is angiogenic [11, 12] and can promote blood flow to tumors by stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release; see reviews [7, 13]. Moreover, the tumor vessels are less responsive to Ang II such that the systemic vasoconstrictor actions of Ang II shunt blood to the tumor vasculature [14, 15]. Stimulation of the AT1 receptor by Ang II transactivates the EGF receptor [16, 17], a receptor that is overexpressed in many cancers [18, 19]. Activation of the AT1 receptor promotes the release of a host of growth factors that also promote cell proliferation [7]. Additionally, in several animal models of cancer, both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1 angiotensin receptor subtype blockers (ARBs) inhibit tumor growth [7].",

            "text": "Since both ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely used antihypertensive agents, meta-analyses have been conducted to identify any correlation for cancer incidence in patients taking these drugs and/or the effects of these drugs on cancer risk. Surprisingly, there is not universal agreement on the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on cancer incidence. For example, a meta-analysis reported in 2010 [20] found a slight increase in cancer risk in individuals that were being treated with ARBs. However, a subsequent meta-analysis published the following year [21] found no association between the use of ARBs and cancer risk. However, they did observe an increase in cancer risk in patients taking both an ARB and an ACE inhibitor. Of note the previous study [20] compared ARB + ACE inhibitor treated groups compared to ACE inhibitor only groups to show the association of ARB use with increased cancer risk. An epidemiological study of ACE inhibitor and/or ARB usage reported an increased risk of cancer deaths [22]; however, a study from the United States Food and Drug Administration [23] found no evidence for an increased cancer risk from ARBs. A recent meta-analysis of RAS blockade with ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs suggested that RAS blockade reduces cancer risk [24]. Another recent meta-analysis focusing on lung cancer risk in patients taking ARBs indicated that ARBs reduce lung cancer risk [25] with all but one [26] of 6 studies showing a reduced risk of cancer with 2 of the studies showing a significant reduction in lung cancer risk on their own [27, 28]. Thus the preponderance of clinical data suggests that ARBs reduce lung cancer risk but that there may be individual or population differences in lung cancer risks associated with RAS blockers. To further explore this putative relationship this study investigates changes in gene expression of RAS and related protein in a population of lung adenocarcinoma patients [1]. This could help to identify specific genes that could be investigated further to determine the exact role of RAS and extended RAS pathway genes in lung adenocarcinomas.",

The high level of expression of the gene encoding the AT1 receptor in the lung suggests that Ang II acting upon the AT1 receptor plays an important role in lung function and cell growth. Consistent with an oncogenic activity of the RAS in lung, AT1 receptor inhibition decreases the metastasis of lung cancer cells [31]. See also reviews 7\u20139. An additional mechanism whereby the RAS could increase tumor growth by activating AT1 receptors is by selectively increasing blood flow in newly formed vessels of tumors which, in contrast to the systemic vasculature, do not constrict in response to Ang II [32]. Corollary to such a mechanism, inhibitors of Ang II formation, agents that increase metabolism of Ang II, and AT1 receptor blockers that lower BP may decrease tumor growth by disproportionately reducing blood flow to the tumor.",

Conversely, the slightly greater reduction in AT2 receptor gene expression could contribute to the oncogenic activity of lung tumor cells by reducing the inhibitory actions on cell growth that Ang II causes by activating the AT2 receptor.

Of note, however, there is a non-RAS functionality of angiotensinogen to interact with DNA, in particular to reverse formation of carcinogenic DNA adducts generated by the contents of tobacco smoke [34]. In this case the increase in angiotensinogen gene expression in lung tumor cells could be a compensatory response of the cells to normalize their DNA by removing the adducts formed by tobacco smoke carcinogens.

Moreover, Ang II can also be generated by chymase, and the mRNA for chymase was not altered in the lung tumor cells. Another consideration is that the mRNA transcribe from the gene ENPEP which encodes aminopeptidase A, also known as angiotensinase A, a major metabolic enzyme of Ang II, is reduced and this could indicate a prolongation of the stimulation of AT1 and AT2 receptors by Ang II. While Ang III the product of aminopeptidase A metabolism of Ang II is a full agonist at AT1 and AT2 receptors, it is known to be rapidly metabolized following its formation, such that any slowing of the conversion of Ang II to Ang III will increase the stimulation of AT1 and AT2 receptors. Moreover, early studies of the proliferative effects of Ang II suggested that Ang III lacked the ability to stimulate cell proliferation [37].",

The reductions in the high level of expression of the genes for two enzymes capable of cleaving Ang I and Ang II to form Ang 1\u20137; neprilysin and prolyl carboxypeptidase, respectively, may cause a reduction in the shunting of Ang I and Ang II away from their roles in the classical RAS and reduce the antagonistic action of the ACE2/Ang 1\u20137/MAS axis.

            "text": "While the changes observed in mRNA expression in some of the components of the RAS in lung adenoma tumor cells are substantial, there are three caveats that must be acknowledged. First, it is uncertain whether these changes in mRNA are contributing to the phenotypic changes in lung cells to become cancer cells, or if they are a result of the phenotypic changes associated with the transformation of normal lung cells to cancer cells. Second, alterations in mRNA expression do not always reflect alterations in protein expression. To assess this second caveat it will be necessary to determine the level of expression of the proteins encoded by the mRNAs that showed significant changes. The third caveat relates to possible changes in signal transduction by the AT1, AT2, and MAS receptors. It is possible that signal transduction in response to activation of these receptors by Ang II, Ang III, and Ang 1\u20137 could be increased or decreased. It is known that the AT1 receptor transduces responses to Ang II via G protein-coupled and G protein independent pathways [43] and that peptide antagonists of the AT1 receptor can signal exclusively through the G protein independent pathway [44], so it is not unreasonable for AT1 receptor activation to have differential effects on cell proliferation due to differences in the efficiency of these two signaling pathways in cancer cells. While it would be of interest to assess the mRNA expression of these signal transduction proteins, it is not possible to specify that their changes are specifically linked to these angiotensin receptors since they mediate transduction by a variety of hormones, cytokines, and neurotransmitters.",

The classical RAS cascade is shown with light shading and includes the two major angiotensin II receptor subtypes, AT1 and AT2. Nonclassical components of the RAS cascade would include the ability of the (pro)renin receptor to activate prorenin, as well as enhance the activity of renin to metabolize angiotensinogen to Ang I, the ability of chymase to convert Ang I to Ang II, metabolism of Ang II to III and III to IV by aminopeptidases A and N, respectively, and the novel AT4 receptor for Ang IV which is also known as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase. In addition, there is the ACE2/Ang 1\u20137/mas axis of the RAS which is considered to be a counterregulator of the actions of the classical RAS. This includes the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which primarily forms Ang 1\u20137 from Ang II, but can also form Ang 1\u20139 from Ang I, prolylcarboxypeptidase which also forms Ang 1\u20137 from Ang II, and the enzymes neprilysin and prolylendopeptidase which forms Ang 1\u20137 directly from Ang I, and MAS, the putative receptor for Ang 1\u20137.
