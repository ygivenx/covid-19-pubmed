            "text": "The burden of malaria continues to worsen globally with a devastating impact on human health and corresponding impediment to economic improvement [1]. Despite worldwide initiatives, emerging drug resistance in different species of Plasmodium and paucity of information about the exact underlying mechanism of the disease pathogenesis are creating challenges for the management and eradication of the disease. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection represents the major cause of malaria associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. Falciparum malaria (FM) accounts for approximately 247 million cases and one million deaths annually, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [2], while outside the African continents, Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is responsible for more than 50% of all malaria cases [3]. In order to survive within the host cells and ensure their reproduction, intracellular parasites like Plasmodium develop versatile mechanisms to exploit their host cells and induce new permeability pathways to permit the uptake of nutrients and the removal of waste products, resulting into activation of multiple host immune cascades and inflammatory responses [4]. Plasmodium infection also affects blood coagulation by diverse pathobiological mechanisms, which results into development of fatal hemorrhagic complication [5], [6]. Investigation of the parasite induced alterations in host proteome and modulation of different vital physiological processes have great clinical relevance in the light of diagnosis and prognosis. Recently, proteomic studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of the clinical proteome of human malaria parasites [7], profiling humoral immune responses to Plasmodium infection [8] and the malaria parasite infection-induced changes in host erythrocyte membrane proteins [9]. The findings obtained from such studies have provided better understanding of the disease pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions and host immune response.",

In recent years, a number of proteomic studies have been carried out to investigate the pathogen induced alterations in human serum/plasma proteome in different infectious diseases including dengue [11], SARS [12], leishmaniasis [13], and leptospirosis [14]. In this study we have investigated the alterations in human serum proteome due to the P. falciparum infection for obtaining mechanistic insight about the disease pathogenesis and host immune response in the most virulent form of human malaria. Additionally, serum proteome changes in FM were compared with vivax malaria (VM); another widely distributed human malaria to study the similarities and differences in host responses against these two major plasmodial infections. To achieve this comparative analysis we have utilized selected dataset of our previous serum proteomics study on VM [15], while additional proteomics and immune-assay-based experiments were performed using a bigger (compared to our previous report) clinical cohort of VM patients. The comparative study on FM and VM revealed that quite a few serum proteins associated with diverse essential physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling, cytokine and chemokine signaling, complement cascades and blood coagulation are commonly altered in both of the plasmodial infections, while some uniquely modulated candidates such as calcium binding protein 39, calpain 10, regulator of G-protein signaling 7, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase, transthyretin in FM and ceruloplasmin, vitamin D-binding protein, serum amyloid P, alpha-2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen beta chain precursor in VM, were also identified. Recently, we performed serum proteomic alterations in another clinically relevant infectious disease, leptospirosis [14]. To evaluate the specificity of the identified protein targets and eliminate the generic febrile responses; expression level of the serum proteins differentially expressed in plasmodial infections (compared to the healthy subjects) was analyzed in leptospirosis patients from our previous study [14]. Another major intention of this present study was identification of the characteristics marker proteins, which can readily discriminate malaria patients (FM from VM as well) from healthy population as well as closely related infectious diseases with high accuracy. The potential serum protein biomarkers identified in our study were used to build statistical models, which successfully classified and predicted the clinical phenotypes of controls (healthy and febrile), FM and VM in a blinded study.",

All of the 63 samples (20 FM, 17 VM, 6 FC and 20 HC) were analyzed individually by classical 2DE in two technical replicates. While, a sub-set of 30 samples (8 each for FM, VM, HC, and 6 FC) were analyzed by 2D-DIGE. During selection of the sub-set cohorts for 2D-DIGE analysis age range, median age value, sex, level of parasitemia, and past history of systemic disease were considered. Particularly, falciparum and vivax malaria patients with similar levels of parasitemia (2000\u20135000 infected RBCs/\u00b5L blood) with first episode of infection and no past history of systemic disease were selected for 2D-DIGE analysis to reduce pre-analytical variations as much as possible. In classical 2DE analysis, patients suffering their first episode of malaria as well as few patients with a past history of malaria (relapse or recurrent) and higher level of parasitemia (>5000 infected RBCs/\u00b5L blood) were included since it was difficult to get bigger cohort of malaria patients with similar parameters. In gel-based proteomic analysis samples were studied individually (n = 63 for classical 2DE and n = 30 for 2D-DIGE) rather than sample pooling to achieve better insights about biological variability from individual samples.",

Representative 2DE images of serum proteome profile of FM subjects and healthy individuals, and bar-diagrammatic representation of the fold change and 3D views of few selected spots are illustrated in Figure 1A and B. In MS analysis 12 different proteins were identified from the 22 differentially expressed protein spots, since in few cases MS analysis revealed similar identity for multiple protein spots appearing as different entities in 2D gels. The similar identity of multiple spots indicates the possibility of presence of various isoforms of those particular proteins probably due to the complex combinations of post-translational modifications. Among the 12 identified proteins; 7 proteins were up-regulated (serum amyloid A, hemopexin precursor, apolipoprotein E, \u03b1-1-antitrypsin precursor, leucine-rich \u03b1-2-glycoprotein, \u03b1-1-BN glycoprotein and \u03b1-1-antichymotrypsin precursor) and 5 proteins were down-regulated (haptoglobin, ficolin 3 precursor, apolipoprotein A-I, clusterin precursor and serum albumin) (Figure S2; Table 2 and S2.1). Interestingly, serum amyloid A (spot U13 and U14) was found to be highly over expressed (>25-fold) in all the FM patients.",

As a result, to circumvent the situation, enhanced plasma levels of antioxidant defense associated enzymes/proteins such as superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) are observed in acute malaria patients [25]. In both FM and VM patients we have identified elevated serum level of hemopexin, a heme-binding protein, which provides the second line of defense against hemoglobin-mediated oxidative damage during intravascular hemolysis [26]. Increased production of this acute phase protein by the host defense system could be helpful to circumvent the pro-inflammatory response with oxidative stress generated in patients with Pf or Pv infection. In contrast, haptoglobin (Hp) found to be significantly down-regulated in FM and VM patients. Hp removes free hemoglobin (Hb) released during parasite induced hemolysis, and disappears as the Hp-Hb complexes leading to the malaria associated hypo-or ahaptoglobinemia and is a promising inflammatory marker to evaluate the severity of the Plasmodium infection [21]. Earlier reports have demonstrated the possible role of this APP as an epidemiological marker for malaria [21], [27].",

Disruption of the interaction between the G-alpha-s subunit of the Gs protein and the receptor results in a reduced erythrocyte invasion by the parasite and subsequent low level of parasitemia [28]. Down-regulation in regulator of G-protein signaling in FM patients might be due to some host response to combat this parasitic infection. Conversely, up-regulation of apolipoprotein E was observed in the malaria patients. This apolipoprotein also inhibits Plasmodium invasion, since it shares the cell entry mediators (heparan sulphate proteoglycans and/or low density lipoprotein receptor) with the parasite [29].

            "text": "Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for the effective treatment and management of malaria. In recent years, multivariate projection methods are being successfully applied to analyze biological data obtained through genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic approaches to study various human diseases, with implications for diagnostics and clinical management [30], [31]. A sub-set of the proteins identified in our proteomic analysis was used to build statistical sample class prediction models to identify the classifier marker proteins for FM, VM and HC discrimination. Interestingly, two key classifier proteins: serum amyloid A and haptoglobin differentially expressed consistently in all of the malaria patients (FM and VM) compared to the control subjects (HC and FC) and remained statistically significant after FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) and Bonferroni correction of the p-values obtained in t-test; indicating very strong correlation between the expression levels of these two serum proteins and plasmodial infections. The recognition ability of the prediction models for FM, VM and HC discrimination and cross-validation was almost 100% (Table S8). We controlled for the statistical false discovery rate using three distinct, iterative validation steps: (i) k-fold cross-validation algorithm for the original cohort, (ii) application of the marker subset identified in the original cohort to classify newly recruited patients, and (iii) performance of the marker subset validated using three well-known machine learning methods. In our study, biological replicates were investigated, i.e. each proteome profile was representative of a different human subject, and hence the data-sets are characterized by low homogeneity, conferring to the protocol a very high level of variability and complexity. Indeed the extreme heterogeneity or large biological variations including gender, age, genetic factors, dietary considerations, environmental factors and drug treatment affects the detection, validation and establishment of \u201cgold standard\u201d serological biomarkers [10], [32]. Nonetheless, the accurate discrimination among the FM, VM and control groups obtained by various prediction models on the basis of differentially expressed candidate proteins testifies to the excellent potential of this analytical approach for the detection and discrimination of VM and FM (Figure 5; Figure S9). It should also be noted that uncomplicated FM and VM patients with diverse range of parasitemia; mainly low and moderate parasitemic (<5000 parasites/\u00b5L blood), were used for the validation of the prediction models (Table 1). Even so, the discrimination accuracy of the study is very appreciable indicating the capability of our analytical approach for the detection of very low-level of parasitemia, which is highly promising from a diagnostic point of view. Although, diagnosis of malaria on the basis of microscopic examination of thin or thick smears of peripheral blood is the most commonly used and well-accepted method, but it requires highly trained personnel for smear interpretation, frequently fails to distinguish mixed-species infections or diagnose patients with \u201csub-microscopic\u201d parasitemia below the detectable limit of blood smears, and in many areas of endemicity the operating characteristics of microscopy are poor [33], [34]. In quest of an early and accurate diagnosis of malaria and discrimination of Pf, Pv or mixed infection, establishment of serum protein markers can be an attractive approach apart from clinical symptoms and conventional microscopic examination of blood smears. To this end, some of the classifier candidate proteins identified in this study; such as serum amyloid A, paraoxonase, apolipoprotein A-I and E, haptoglobin, hemopexin, and complement C4 are very important due to their functional relevance in malaria pathogenesis and could further be investigated as potential surrogate protein markers for clinical implications. Various rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are in practice for malaria diagnosis, which diagnose the infection on the basis of detection of parasite proteins/antigens e.g. histidine-rich protein II (HRP-II) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [35], whereas for the first time we have demonstrated the discrimination between FM and VM patients based on protein expression in human host. Malaria RDTs are used regularly in clinics due to the low cost, sensitivity and less detection time. However, analysis of frozen specimens of blood from parasitaemic patients using existing RDTs is bit challenging. Another limiting factor is the shelf-life of RDTs, since most of the existing RDTs deteriorate rapidly on exposure to moisture (humidity) and high temperature. Moreover, significant variations may appear between technicians in both RDT preparation and result interpretation process depending on experience of the performer, manual proficiency and visual perception [36]. To this end, serum protein markers can be potential candidates for development of an alternative sensitive diagnostic approach for malaria. Development of highly sensitive biosensors for the identified surrogate proteins might be attractive from a diagnostic point of view.",

In this comprehensive proteomic analysis we have identified multiple differentially expressed serum proteins with versatile biological functions, indicating the modulation of multiple vital physiological pathways in FM and VM patients. We anticipate that information obtained from this study will provide valuable insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of malaria and may help to establish early detection surrogates for these infectious parasitic diseases to meet the need for better diagnostics and effective therapy. Some of our identified classifier proteins such as serum amyloid A, apolipoprotein A-I and E and haptoglobin, which successfully discriminated FM from VM might be prognostic host markers for disease severity. To this end, it would be interesting to elucidate the fate of the identified serum proteins in severe malaria patients and could be a future continuation of this study. Diagnostic impact of the identified serum biomarkers in clinics and specificity for malaria prediction can only be established after investigation of the disease patterns in large clinical cohorts.",

Patients suffering from uncomplicated Pf or Pv infection with asexual parasite count more than 1000 per \u00b5L of blood were selected for this study. A total of 37 patients, with uncomplicated FM (n = 20) or VM (n = 17) confirmed through microscopic examination of a thin peripheral blood smear followed by RDT were enrolled for this proteomic study. In addition, blood specimens were collected from age and sex matched leptospirosis patients (n = 6) as febrile controls, and healthy subjects (n = 20) to perform comparative proteomic analysis. Written informed consent was taken from each participant (malaria patients and controls) prior to the sample collection process. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical details of all malaria patients and febrile controls (FC) selected for this proteomic study are provided in Table 1. Blood samples (5.0 mL) were collected from the antecubital vein of the subjects using serum separation tubes (BD Vacutainer\u00ae; BD Biosciences). Immediately after blood collection the tubes were kept in ice for 30 mins for clotting. Serum separation was performed as described previously [15]. In brief, after clotting, the samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm at 20\u00b0C for 10 mins and serum was collected carefully from the upper surface. Collected serum was divided into multiple aliquots and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until time of analysis to prevent protein degradation. Prior to proteomic analysis, maximum 2\u20133 freeze/thaw cycles were allowed for any serum sample to reduce pre-analytical variations.",

After sonication, the top two high-abundance serum proteins (albumin and IgG) were removed using Albumin & IgG Depletion SpinTrap (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Extraction of protein from depleted serum samples was performed employing TCA/acetone precipitation method as described by Chen et al., with slight modifications [37]. In brief, depleted serum samples were diluted (1\u22364 ratio) with ice-cold acetone containing 10% (w/v) TCA. Uniform mixing was performed using mild vortexing for 15 sec and the mixture was allowed to incubate at \u221220\u00b0C for 2 hrs for protein precipitation. After completion of the incubation period, tubes were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were separated and kept in fresh microcentrifuge tubes, and the pellets were dissolved in rehydration buffer [8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (v/v) IPG buffer (pH 4\u20137; Linear), 40 mM DTT and traces of bromophenol blue]. In order to precipitate the remaining amount of proteins present in the collected 10% TCA/acetone-containing supernatants, 1 mL ice-cold acetone was added to each tube and the samples were subjected one additional round of precipitation and extraction process. In all cases, prior to re-suspension in rehydration buffer, the pellet was briefly air-dried. Prior to proteomic analyses, protein concentration in the samples was quantified using the 2D-Quant kit (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A total of 600 \u00b5g of depleted serum protein extract dissolved in 350 \u00b5L of rehydration buffer was loaded on 4\u20137 pH range IPG strips (18 cm) and underwent passive rehydration for 14\u201316 hrs. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on an Ettan IPGphore 3 isoelectric focusing unit (GE Healthcare) for overall approximately 78 kVh using the following voltage settings: 200 V for 4 h (step and hold), 500 V for 1 h (step and hold), 1000 V for 1 h (step and hold), 8000 V for 3 h (gradient), and 8000 V for 7\u223630 h (step and hold). After completion of IEF, the focused IPG strips were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until the second dimensional analysis was performed. Preceding to the second dimensional separation, each strip was equilibrated to reduce and alkylate the proteins (for 15 min each) using equilibration buffer containing 6 M Urea, 75 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 29.3% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.002% (w/v) bromophenol blue. Just prior to use, 1% (w/v) DTT or 2.5% (w/v) IAA was added in the first (reducing) and second (alkylating) equilibration buffer, respectively. The second dimension was performed on 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels using an Ettan DALTsix electrophoresis unit (GE Healthcare). After electrophoresis GelCode Blue Safe Protein Stain (Thermo Scientific, USA) was utilized for visualization of the protein spots.

After scanning, gel images were cropped properly using ImageQuant software; version 5.0 (GE Healthcare) prior to importing in DeCyder 2D software; version 7.0 (GE Healthcare) for comparative analysis and relative protein quantification across the FM and control samples. Comparative analysis was performed using two different modules, differential in-gel analysis (DIA) and biological variation analysis (BVA) of the DeCyder software. Preliminary analysis was performed using DIA module to detect spots on a cumulative image derived from merging up to three individual images from an in-gel linked image set (malaria, controls and internal standard). It permits the pair-wise comparisons of each normal and malaria samples to the mixed standard present in each gel and offers spot-wise protein abundance as ratios. Further analysis was performed using BVA module to get the variation in protein expression levels between any of the two experimental groups (FM vs. VM, FM vs. HC and VM vs HC) across all the sets. Statistical significance of the average ratio of expressions was analyzed by Student\u2019s t-test. Protein spots exhibiting differential expression with reproducibly and statistical significance (p<0.05) were considered for further analysis. Bonferroni correction (for reducing Type I errors) of the p-values obtained from Student\u2019s t-test was performed using standard Bonferroni procedure to recognize those marker proteins which have very strong connection with the diseased state (remains significant after Bonferroni correction). Since Bonferroni correction is extremely conservative; comparatively less stringent false discovery rate (FDR) correction was also performed as detailed in Benjamini and Hochberg [38].",

Spot excision was performed manually. In-gel digestion of the proteins separated by 2D gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Shevchenko et al., with slight modifications [39]. In short, gel slices were cut into small cubes (\u223c1\u00d71 mm) and washed with 50 \u00b5L of stain removal solution (25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer) for removal of CBB stain. After washing, 50 \u00b5L of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1\u22361 v/v) was added, followed by 5 min incubation with occasional vortexing at room temperature. After incubation, the solutions were removed. These two steps are repeated for three times.

Spots were allowed to dry for 30 mins at room temperature. After air drying, the crystallized spots were analysed using a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA) linked to 4000 series explorer software (version 3.5.3). All mass spectra were recorded in a reflector mode within a mass range from 800 to 4000 Da, using a Nd:YAG 355 nm laser.

MS/MS spectra were acquired for the 15 most abundant precursor ions, with a total accumulation of 1500 laser shots and collision energy of 1 kV. Once the MS survey scans were completed, the data were processed to generate a list of precursor ions for interrogation by MS/MS. The combined MS and MS/MS peak lists were searched using the GPS\u2122 Explorer software version 3.6 (AB Sciex). Protein identification was performed by MS/MS ion search using MASCOT version 2.1 (http://www.martixscience.com) search engine against the Swiss-Prot database. Searches were carried out with the following parameters; all entries taxonomy, trypsin digestion with one missed cleavage, fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, variable modifications: oxidation of methionine residues, mass tolerance 150 ppm for MS and 0.4 Da for MS/MS.

GO terms that were enriched in two or more proteins were considered. In addition, a significance p-value of the enrichment was computed using the hypergeometric probability distribution, which identifies GO categories represented by the 30 proteins relative to their representation on the Biological Genome for Human created using information available at NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA).",

We used GeneSpring\u2019s pathway database to create Shortest Connect network from the selected pathways. The Expand Selection algorithm was performed on the above network to include first and second degree neighbors. Expand Selection uses the GeneSpring pathway database for finding expansion on entities and takes a series of expansions to connect processes/functions/other biomolecules to the given entities (proteins).

Discrimination of malaria (FM and VM) from FC (leptospirosis) and statistical sample class prediction was performed on the basis of differential expression levels of 6 candidate proteins (serum amyloid A, hemopexin, apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein and apolipoprotein A-I) (Table S8.3A). Selection of the candidate proteins was executed on the basis of their level of differential expression and ability to discriminate between the clinical phenotypes. For multivariate statistical analysis and machine learning, the data were mean centered; scaled and logarithmic transformation was performed in order to lower relatively large differences among the respective spot abundances. 2DE data was additionally normalized using Quantile method to correct for batch difference. 3 levels of validation were used to establish the reliability of identified differentially expressed proteins to detect correct phenotypic classes using Mass Profiler Professional (MPP).",

Partial least squares is a regression method using the information contained in X data matrix (predictor variables) to predict the behavior of Y data matrix (response variables). PLS method models both X and Y variables simultaneously to find the latent variables in X that will predict the latent variables in Y [44]. The application of PLS as a classification method is indicated as PLS-DA [45], [46]. SVM separates two classes by generating the hyperplane (in a high-dimensional feature space) which maximizes the distance from the hyperplane to the closest training examples [47]. In Decision Trees a sample gets classified by following the appropriate path down the decision tree. The Naive Bayesian model is built based on the probability distribution function of the training data along each feature. Since Decision Trees and Na\u00efve Bayes directly handle multi-class problems, we have used the default parameters for these techniques. The SVMs are trained using sequential minimal optimization with a linear kernel. Validation of the obtained predictive models was performed using a standard K-fold cross-validation procedure: observations in input data were randomly divided into three equal parts, two parts were used for model training, and the remaining samples were classified using the constructed model. The whole process was repeated for 10 times.",
