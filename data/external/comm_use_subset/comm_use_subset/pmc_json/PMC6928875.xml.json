Enteroviruses have non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes that measure around 7.5 kilobases [1]. There are 15 species in the genus Enterovirus, namely, Enterovirus A to L and Rhinovirus A to C. Among members of the species Enterovirus A, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are two of the most common causes of recurrent community outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) among children worldwide and particularly in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. For example, in mainland China, recurrent large outbreaks of HFMD involving >120,000\u2013600,000 patients have been reported since 1998 [2,3]. Outbreaks of EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections with severe or fatal cases have also been reported in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Australia [4]. Importantly, severe EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections are associated with life-threatening complications, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with respiratory failure, and death [1,5]. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these clinical and pathological features are incompletely understood. ",

Viruses, including enteroviruses, may utilize lipids as receptors or entry co-factors for virus entry [6,7], as building blocks or regulators of the viral replication complex [8,9], as well as signaling factors to facilitate the cellular distribution of viral proteins, and the trafficking, assembly, and release of virus particles [10,11]. Interestingly, viruses require a repertoire of host lipids to complete their life cycle. Inhibitions of key lipogenesis enzymes can downregulate virus replication [12]. However, when supplied in excess, these lipids can similarly perturb efficient virus replication [13]. Together, these evidences suggest that the complete lipid landscape induced upon virus infection is required for optimal virus replication. The perturbations in the host cell lipidomic profiles upon enterovirus infection have not been fully characterized.",

The retention time shift and mass accuracy of lipid standards ranged from \u22120.12%\u20134.73% and \u22127.7\u20134.13 ppm, respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV) of all internal standards in cell samples and the QC samples were lower than 18% and 15%, respectively. These results indicated that the operation repeatability was satisfactory. To evaluate the stability of the analytical batch, the CV values of all mass features in the quality control (QC) samples were calculated. A total of 98.70% and 93.32% of the features measured in the negative and positive mode, respectively, exhibited CV values of <30%, indicating that the analytical batch was stable with minimal variations. Taken together, these results showed that the analytical method was reliable and the observed differences among the test samples represented true physiological differences, rather than technical errors [15].",

Then, the normalized list was imported into the MetaboAnalyst and SIMCA-P software for further analysis. The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots in both the negative and positive modes were applied to visualize the distribution of lipids and discrimination between virus-infected and mock-infected samples. As shown in Figure 1, the lipid profiles of the three types of samples were clearly separated in both the negative and positive modes. This indicated that many lipid MS features exhibited obvious changes and some MS features contributed to the discrimination pattern among the three groups under the PLS-DA pattern recognition. In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) score plots were applied to visualize the distribution of the lipids and the relatedness of virus-infected and mock-infected samples. As shown in Figure S1, all cell samples were distributed in the statistical confidence region based on the Hotelling\u2019s T2 test.

After applying the selection criteria of an adjusted p < 0.05, a total of 31 significantly different features (4.98%, negative mode) and 451 features (30.15%, positive mode) were identified between the EV-A71-infected vs. mock-infected samples. A total of 58 significantly different features (9.32%, negative mode) and 273 features (18.25%, positive mode) were identified between CV-A16-infected vs. mock-infected samples. In the multivariate analysis, these cross-validated parameters were satisfactory for the OPLS-DA model (Table S2). Our model also satisfied the permutation test (100 times), which was based on the PLS-DA model when the results of the EV-A71 or CV-A16-infected samples were compared with that of the mock-infected samples (Figure S2). Overall, these results demonstrated that our validated statistical model reliably identified the significantly perturbed lipid features in our comparative lipidomic analysis between the virus-infected and mock-infected samples.",

A total of 47 significantly changed lipids were identified when the three groups of samples were compared in pairs. These lipids included those belonging to the phospholipid, glycerolipid, fatty acyls, and sphingolipid categories [17]. Detailed information of these 47 identified lipids was listed in Table 1 [18]. These 47 lipids belonged to 11 lipid classes, including cardiolipin (CL), diacylglycerol (DAG), ether-linked lysophosphatidylcholine (EtherLPC), ether-linked lysophosphatidylethanolamine (EtherLPE), ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine (EtherPE), free fatty acids (FFA), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM), and triacylglycerol (TAG) (Figure 3A) [14].

Our box-whisker plots showed that AA, DHA, DPA, and EPA indeed all exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels in both EV-A71- and CV-A16-infected samples at 4 hpi (Figure 5). Then, we treated EV-A71 and CV-A16-infected RD cells with AA, DHA, DPA, or EPA and assessed their anti-enteroviral effects in vitro. As shown in Figure 6, AA, DHA, and EPA exhibited significant (p < 0.001 to <0.05) antiviral effects against both EV-A71 and CV-A16 with 1\u20132 logs reduction in viral load.",

In corroboration with our findings, a recent report also showed that human rhinovirus A, another important human pathogenic picornavirus, induces substantial fatty acid modifications in human bronchial epithelial cells [24]. AA, DHA, DPA, and EPA are all polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). AA is an omega-6 PUFA, while DHA, DPA, and EPA are omega-3 PUFAs [25]. It has been previously shown that PUFA play key roles in inflammatory processes [9,13,26]. AA is a precursor to pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins (PG) and leukotrienes (LT), as well as lipoxins, which are endogenous anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving molecules reducing tissue injury and chronic inflammation [27]. DHA and EPA inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced and lipopeptide-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression and thus the inflammatory response in epithelial and dendritic cells [28,29]. Moreover, lipids derived from EPA (Resolvin E series) and DHA (Resolvin D series, maresins, and protectins) are involved in the resolution of inflammation and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties [26,30]. The omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs interact in a delicate manner to regulate the inflammatory response. For example, omega-3 PUFAs such as DHA and EPA may serve as competitive substrates for omega-6 PUFA metabolism to decrease AA-derived eicosanoids and their effects on inflammation [31]. ",

            "text": "To investigate the biological relevance of the significantly upregulated expression of PUFAs in the context of enterovirus infection, we evaluated the effects of AA, DHA, DPA, and EPA on the replication of EV-A71 and CV-A16. We showed that three of these four PUFAs (AA, DHA, and EPA) significantly inhibited the replication of both viruses. This corroborated with our previous observation that fatty acids, including AA, possesses antiviral activity against coronaviruses [13]. Taken together, these results suggested that like coronaviruses, EV-A71 and CV-A16 might modulate specific lipid pathways in the host lipid profile to achieve an intricate homeostasis to facilitate their replication. Excessive exogenous addition of lipids might therefore disrupt this delicate homeostatic state and prevent efficient viral replication. Corroborating with our recent identification of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) as a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment, precise manipulation of the host lipid profile might therefore be a potential host-targeting antiviral strategy for enterovirus infection [33].

The lipids were dissolved in 2% ethanol and 2% ethanol alone was used as \u201cControl\u201d. The cells were then infected with either EV-A71 or CV-A16 (MOI = 10.0). At 1 hpi, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium (DMEM) and then replenished with lipid-supplemented medium for 4 h of incubation. The cell lysates were then collected for qRT-PCR. Data represented means and standard deviations.
