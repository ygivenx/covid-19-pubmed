            "text": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. In spite of being the focus of intense research efforts, no vaccine is available against HCV, and current therapeutic treatments have limited efficacy and significant side effects [2]. HCV belongs to the Flaviviridae family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses [3]. Structural studies on this virus are difficult, in part because it propagates poorly in cell culture, and particles isolated from infected patients are heterogeneous and not amenable to a detailed structural characterization. Little structural information is available on the envelope proteins, which are heavily glycosylated, display hypervariable loops, and are stabilized by numerous disulfide bridges [4]. The folding kinetics of these proteins are slow, requiring several hours for completion of a complex process involving various ER chaperones of the infected cell [5]. These properties make their recombinant production - in a native conformation and in sufficient amounts for structural studies - a difficult endeavor. Yet structural information on the HCV envelope proteins would be extremely valuable, given that they carry the main antigenic determinants of the virus and play an essential role in cell entry by binding to specific receptors and inducing membrane fusion. HCV has indeed been shown to depend on a number of cellular molecules for entry, including CD81 [6] and the tight junction transmembrane proteins claudin 1, 6, 9 and occludin [7]\u2013[9], as well as the scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) [10]. The LDL receptor also plays a role in HCV uptake, in line with the observation that HCV particles in infected plasma are associated with LDL species [11]. A direct interaction of the HCV envelope protein E2 with CD81 and SR-B1 has been demonstrated, and these interactions were shown to be necessary but not sufficient for cell entry. The mode of interaction of HCV with the claudins and occludin is not understood at present.",

            "text": "The HCV genome codes for a single polyprotein precursor about 3000 amino acids long, spanning the ER membrane multiple times. It contains, sequentially, the viral proteins in the order Nter-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A/B-NS5A/B-Cter. The N-terminal 1/4th of the precursor corresponds to the structural proteins C (Core), E1 and E2 (envelope proteins 1 and 2) and p7, which functions as a proton channel. The remainder of the polyprotein contains the non-structural (NS) proteins, which have enzymatic and other activities that are necessary for virus replication. The mature viral proteins are generated by proteolytic processing of the precursor by cellular and viral proteases [3]. In particular, the envelope proteins are generated by host-cell signalases. E1 and E2 are type 1 trans-membrane (TM) proteins with a large N-terminal ectodomain and almost no cytoplasmic tail. In the best characterized HCV strain H77, E1 and E2 are 192 and 366 amino acids long and contain 6 and 11 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, respectively. Biochemical studies have shown that E1 and E2 fold as a heterodimer, which is found at the surface of viral particles and is thought to be the functional glycoprotein form [4]. There are currently 6 identified HCV genotypes further divided into several subtypes [12]. The amino acid sequence identity between envelope proteins from different genotypes is about 68% for the most distant genotypes. E2 has been shown to contain 3 hypervariable regions that can be deleted without affecting the overall fold of the protein, as assayed by binding to conformation-sensitive mAbs and CD81 [13]\u2013[15].",

In particular, the envelope proteins are present in tandem within the polyprotein precursor. This arrangement of the structural part of the genome is characteristic of viruses encoding class II fusion proteins, reviewed in [16]. These proteins have been extensively characterized, structurally and biochemically, for viruses in the flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family [17]. Class II proteins have a common tertiary structure, which has also been observed in the fusion protein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an alphavirus belonging to a separate family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses, the Togaviridae\n[18]. Togaviridae and Flaviviridae display the same gene order in the structural part of their genomes. There is no amino acid sequence similarity in the alpha- and flavivirus fusion proteins, however, and in spite of sharing a common fold, they are stabilized by a different pattern of disulfide bonds. Viruses within the Flaviviridae families have no sequence similarity across the various genera either, and the fusion proteins from each genus also appear to have their own characteristic pattern of disulfide bonds. Yet the conservation of the class II fold across viral families in the absence of sequence conservation strongly suggests that it is also conserved across the different genera within the respective families.",

This heterodimer later dissociates to drive membrane fusion upon interactions with the host cell. The first glycoprotein in the tandem thus acts as chaperone for folding the second one, which has the membrane fusion role. The chaperone function was experimentally demonstrated for the flavivirus prM [19] and the alphavirus p62 [20] glycoproteins, which precede the fusion proteins E and E1, respectively, in the precursor polyprotein. The effect on folding appears to be reciprocal, since both p62 and prM also adopt their native conformation only in presence of the respective accompanying fusion protein (unpublished observations). Importantly, heterodimerization upon folding has also been characterized for viruses belonging to other genera in the two families, and in particular for HCV [5],[21].",

This process involves homodimer (E-E, flavivirus) or heterodimer (E2-E1, alphavirus) dissociation, followed by homotrimerization of E (flavivirus) or E1 (alphavirus) upon binding to lipids. The tertiary structure of class II viral fusion proteins contains predominantly \u03b2-sheets segregated into three distinct domains arranged linearly, resulting in a rod-like molecule. The central domain 1 (DI) is a \u03b2-sandwich with two long insertions in loops connecting adjacent \u03b2-strands. These insertions form an elongated \u201cfusion\u201d domain (DII), carrying the \u201cfusion loop\u201d in the first of the two insertions, at the distal end of the rod. The fusion loop is a segment of the polypeptide chain that inserts into the target membrane in the first step of membrane fusion. At its C-terminal end, DI is connected via a flexible linker to domain 3 (DIII), which is located at the opposite side with respect to DII, giving rise to the linear organization of the molecule. DIII plays an important role in the fusogenic conformational change, during which it relocates to the side of the molecule, resulting in the characteristic \u201chairpin\u201d conformation of the protein, which drives membrane fusion. This relocation involves a considerable stretching of the segment connecting DI to DIII, the region that changes most dramatically in conformation during the fusogenic transition (reviewed in [16]).",

It is worth noting, however, that while totally unrelated viruses can have structurally homologous fusion proteins (for example, rhabdoviruses, herpesviruses and baculoviruses, reviewed in [24]), related viruses can use non-homologous fusion proteins, as is the case with paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses, which belong to the Mononegavirales order (reviewed in [25]). Yet the fact that viruses belonging to different genera in the Flaviviridae and Togaviridae families display a genomic arrangement that is the signature of class II fusion proteins, together with the additional common features outlined above, makes it very likely that they code for envelope glycoproteins that are at least distantly related to class II proteins.",

More importantly, this model does not take into account the location of the strictly conserved cysteine residues forming 9 disulfide bonds [27]. This model also lacks the third domain, which is important in the fusogenic transition. Moreover, it was also proposed that the membrane fusion function could be carried by HCV glycoprotein E1 (i.e., the first glycoprotein in the tandem) [28],[29], in spite of the similarities with flavi- and alphaviruses discussed above, and in the absence of experimental support. Furthermore, a bioinformatics model for HCV E1 as a truncated class II protein was reported [30], postulating that E1 has the fold of DII of an alpha- or flavivirus fusion protein, but neglecting the fact that in class II proteins, DII works in conjunction with the other two domains covalently linked within the polypeptide to induce membrane fusion. The corollary is that controversial hypotheses have been reported concerning the identity of the HCV fusion protein. It is therefore important to stress that the structural studies performed over the years on viral membrane fusion proteins strongly suggest that most animal enveloped viruses encode fusion proteins belonging to one of the three currently characterized structural classes [31]. It is thus highly unlikely that HCV would have acquired a totally novel fusion machinery (for instance, one in which E1 would be the membrane fusion protein), especially when taking into account the similarities to class II proteins presented above.",

The absence of the transmembrane (TM) segment in E2 leads to secretion of its ectodomain after folding in the presence of E1. This approach is based on previous results leading to production of recombinant dengue virus E protein in the presence of its viral chaperone prM [32]. We tested the conformation of recombinant HCV E2e biochemically and functionally, showing that it reacts with conformation-sensitive antibodies and inhibits infection of Huh7.5 cells by infectious HCV particles (HCVcc) in a dose-dependent manner. Knowledge of the disulfide bonds, along with functional data on deletion mutants [14] and CD81 binding [26],[33],[34], together with secondary structure predictions, provide sufficient constraints to reconstitute the tertiary organization of the molecule. This information allowed the threading of the E2e polypeptide chain onto a class II template by matching the predicted \u03b2-strands. The resulting model reveals the distribution of the amino acids of HCV E2 among the different domains, maps the CD81 binding site to the DI/DIII interface, and highlights a strictly conserved segment of the polypeptide chain as a strong candidate for the HCV fusion loop.",

In order to ensure that the recombinant E2 proteins were functional, we selected isolates previously tested for entry of retroviral particles pseudotyped with HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp) with the corresponding sequences [35]. Induction of expression at high cell density with CdCl2 resulted in accumulation of relatively high levels of secreted E2e in the cell culture medium. We purified the protein to homogeneity from the supernatant (described in Text S1), with the yields listed in Table 1. E2e from the different isolates behaved similarly, as judged by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) followed by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing and non-reducing conditions and Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 1). In a typical SEC profile, the majority of the protein elutes at a volume corresponding to a monomer, with additional minor peaks corresponding to disulfide linked dimers and higher multimers, which vary depending on the construct analyzed. The monomeric form was efficiently separated from the other species by pooling the corresponding fractions. Analytical ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering confirmed the monomeric state of the protein eluted in these fractions (data not shown). Once isolated, E2e from all constructs listed in Table 1 remained monomeric and showed no tendency to associate into disulfide-linked aggregates over time. The construct corresponding to the genotype 2b isolate (UKN2b_2.8) reproducibly yielded the highest amounts of purified monomeric protein (Table 1). The construct from genotype 4 (UKN4_11.1 isolate) yielded a significant fraction of disulfide-linked aggregates (Fig. 1), which are likely to correspond to misfolded protein. E2e from the remaining 7 constructs yielded slightly lower yields of purified, monomeric protein than did the genotype 2b construct, the lowest yields being from the gentoype 6 isolate (Table 1). The SEC profiles from the 7 other constructs were intermediate between the two chromatograms shown in Fig. 1.",

This effect is in line with the observation that E2e makes a stoichiometric complex with CD81, as described above.",

We used recombinant E2e to experimentally analyze its secondary structure composition with two complementary methodologies, circular dichroism (CD), which is sensitive to the presence of \u03b1-helices, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which readily detects \u03b2-sheets present in a protein. We carried out these tests in parallel with recombinant control class II envelope proteins of known structure available in the laboratory. For the CD measurements, the controls were WNV sE, ([37], PDB 2I69) and the ectodomain of glycoprotein E1 (sE1) of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which displays 62.5% amino acid sequence identity with the SFV E1 ectodomain, the crystal structure of which is known ([18], PDB 2Ala). Unexpectedly, the far-UV spectra of the three proteins exhibited considerable differences (Fig. 4A), the spectrum of HCV E2e being in agreement with a previous study [38]. However, deconvolution to retrieve the percentage of the various secondary-structure elements suggests similar ratios for all three proteins, indicating, in particular, only about 5% \u03b1-helices in all three proteins. The strong minimum observed at 203 nm in the spectrum of HCV E2e suggests the presence of natively unfolded regions that are absent in the control proteins.",

Because the WNV sE was not available at the time of the experiment, we used instead sE from dengue virus serotype 3 (DV3), for which the crystal structure is also known (PDB entry 1UZG [39]). The high-frequency region of the FTIR spectra of HCV E2e and DV3 sE is displayed in Fig. 4B. As expected, both proteins have their absorption maxima in the amide I band at 1637 and 1640 cm\u22121, respectively, close to the 1630 cm\u22121 value typical for \u03b2-sheet containing polypeptides (reviewed in [40]), in agreement with the structure of the flavivirus sE and strongly indicating that HCV E2e also contains predominantly \u03b2-sheets. In order to obtain a quantitative measure of the \u03b2-sheet content of E2e, we performed a further analysis to more precisely compare the secondary structure content of the two proteins by computing a difference spectrum after normalization to an identical area under the amide I band. The DV3/sE \u2013 HCV/E2e difference spectrum showed a positive peak at 1630 cm\u22121, as well as a broad negative region ranging from 1645 to 1680 cm\u22121 (Fig. 4B). The value of the positive peak indicated about 14% higher \u03b2-sheet content for DV3 sE, which, when using the value of 42% \u03b2-sheet estimated from the DV3 sE crystal structure, gives about 28% \u03b2-sheet for HCV E2e. The negative area of the difference FTIR spectrum indicates that the HCV E2e polypeptide displays higher relative amounts of secondary structure other than \u03b2-pleated sheet (random coil, \u03b2-turns, 3/10 helices, etc.). This difference is likely to reflect the presence of the regions that give rise to the strong minimum at 203 nm in the CD spectrum (Fig. 4A), i.e., natively unfolded segments of the polypeptide chain.",

We fully deglycosylated the protein with PNGase F under denaturing conditions, then digested it with trypsin followed by separation of the resulting peptides by HPLC under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Comparison of the HPLC elution profiles enabled the identification of peaks that were affected by reduction with TCEP (asterisks in Fig. 5A). We analyzed the samples in these peaks by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) with a time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometer (Table S1), and identified their N-terminal sequence by Edman degradation (Fig. S3). This procedure allowed the unambiguous experimental identification of 8 out of the 9 disulfide bonds present in the protein, thereby also identifying the 9th by exclusion (Table 2). This table also shows that 5 disulfides were independently identified in at least two different strains, validating the procedure.

This knowledge can be used in conjunction with other available data to get a better picture of the tertiary structure of the protein, namely: i) the observation that E2e is rich in \u03b2-sheet and that secondary structure predictions suggest regions with consensus \u03b2-strands along its amino acid sequence; ii) the identity of residues that are far apart in primary structure and that are known to be part of the CD81 binding site; iii) the postulate that E2 is the HCV fusion protein and therefore has a characteristic 3-domain class II fold, in agreement with the organization of its precursor polyprotein, which also implies iv) that the third domain (DIII) should be connected to DI via a linker that can extend to stabilize a post-fusion trimer. Finally, DIII should be followed by a flexible \u201cstem\u201d region - the presence of which has already been reported for HCV E2 [41] - connecting to the TM segment. Further information comes from the identification of \u201chypervariable\u201d regions in HCV E2 that can be deleted without affecting the reactivity of the resulting deletion mutant with conformation-sensitive mAbs and with CD81 [14]. In addition, numerous reports have shown that the E2 ectodomain truncated at position 661, which is in the loop closed by disulfide 9 (Table 2), also reacts with conformation-sensitive mAbs and CD81 [38], suggesting that the downstream segment is not part of the structured ectodomain.",

We therefore began the threading process by assigning the 3 consecutive \u03b2-strands predicted immediately downstream of the HVR1 (Fig. 3, first three red boxes) to the three conserved strands in the N-terminal part of DI, i.e. B0, C0 and D0. These \u03b2-strands are followed by a long intervening region that is compatible with the D0E0 insertion of the class II fold. For the assignment of strands E0 and F0, the available data on the residues involved in CD81 binding (small blue circles in Fig. 3) provide valuable information, since strand E0 must interact with D0 (see diagram in Fig. 6B). Thus, assigning E0 and F0 to the two consecutive strands predicted after residue 525 brings together a patch of residues that are apart in primary structure to the same face of DI, forming the site of interaction with CD81 (Fig. 6). For the assignment of the remaining \u03b2-strands, there is crucial information provided by disulfide 1. This disulfide bond connects Cys429, at the end of strand C0, with Cys552 further downstream, which therefore must be at the same end of the DI \u03b2-sandwich. This means that Cys552 must be located either at the G0H0 loop, or at the end of the I0 strand, if the molecule is to have a class II fold (Fig. 6B). However, after strand F0, there is a long strand predicted to span residues 549\u2013555 (Fig. 3), which would have Cys552 in the middle. But the comparison of predicted versus experimentally determined \u03b2-strands of alphavirus E1 shows that, for several alphaviruses, the region of G0 and H0 is also predicted as a single long strand (Fig. 3B). Indeed, in both alphaviruses and HCV, there is a glycine residue (Gly 551 in E2e) forming a tight turn that reverses the chain orientation, going from G0 into H0 (some alphaviruses have two glycines at this \u03b2-turn). This shows that the prediction algorithms are not 100% reliable, suggesting that in HCV E2, Gly551 is at the G0H0 turn, and that Cys552 is the first residue of strand H0. Indeed, running at the edge of the DI \u03b2-sandwich, the sequence of G0 (as well as the sequence of the alphavirus B0 strand, at the other end of the bottom \u03b2-sheet, Fig. 3B) appears to be less typical than the sequences of internal \u03b2-strands in a \u03b2-sheet, which are easier to predict by computer algorithms. In addition, the short connections between strands F0 through H0 in both alpha- and flavivirus DI are also consistent with the assignment of H0 to a strand running between residues 552 and 555 in HCV E2.",

In alpha- and flaviviruses, I0 is one of the two central \u03b2-strands of the bottom sheet of DI, and is directly followed by the linker connecting to DIII. Because it is the only strand missing to complete the 8-stranded \u03b2-sandwich, it can only make disulfide bonds to cysteines located upstream in primary sequence. In HCV, three \u03b2-strands are predicted directly downstream to the assigned H0 strand: one around residue 563, one around 573, and one around 593 (Fig. 3). The strand around residue 573 is part of a segment that can be deleted without affecting protein conformation [14], indicating that it cannot be I0. The strand around 593 ends at Cys597, which forms disulfide 7 with Cys620 further downstream. Because class II proteins can have no interdomain disulfides - which would be incompatible with their function - this strand cannot be assigned to I0 either. Indeed, the interleaved nature of disulfide bonds 7 and 8 dictates that none of the strands predicted downstream can be in DI. The only option compatible with a class II fold is, therefore, to assign the strand around residue 563 to I0. This assignment implies that the long insertion in the H0I0 loop of the alpha- and flavivirus fusion proteins is absent in HCV E2. This is in line with E2 from HCV and pestiviruses being shorter than the alpha- and flavivirus fusion proteins by about 80\u2013110 amino acids, i.e., roughly the length of the insertion in the H0I0 loop of the latter.",

As discussed above, the segment containing disulfide 9 is likely not to be part of the structured ectodomain, further implying that DIII is comprised between disulfides 6 and 9, spanning about 70 amino acids. The presence of two long-range disulfide bonds (disulfides 7 and 8) suggests that this region is indeed structured into a separate domain. However, the secondary structure predictions point to only 3 \u03b2-strands in this domain, indicating that the Ig-like fold of DIII in alpha- and flaviviruses may not have been maintained in HCV.

Another important difference to the latter are the numerous glycosylation sites in HCV E2. Our model indicates that these sites cluster in particular on the exposed face of DI. Indeed, several glycans appear to frame the CD81 binding surface, partially shielding it from recognition by circulating antibodies. These are glycans 1, 2, 6, 7, and possibly 10 and 11 (Fig. 6A).

This difference is likely to be related to the intrinsic flexibility of HCV DII, since the fusion loop is unlikely to lie at the distant tip of an unstructured domain. During membrane fusion, the fusion loop could be further stabilized by interaction with the membrane proximal region of the stem, once the molecule adopts its fusogenic hairpin conformation. This organization also suggests a significantly shorter post-fusion HCV E2 trimer, compared to the other class II proteins.

In the absence of 3D structural data, our results constitute an important step to better understand the function of the HCV envelope proteins. This knowledge, in turn, can help devise possible antiviral strategies against this important pathogen. Our data also provide a handle to dissect and obtain structural data on the E2 domains separately, given that the intact ectodomain is very difficult to crystallize.",

A) The main elements of the tertiary structure model of HCV E2 are framed: assigned strands in DI (red, labeled) and DIII (blue), putative fusion loop (yellow), the stem (grey) and regions that can be deleted without affecting the protein conformation (brown). The 18 cysteines, which form the 9 disulfides, are marked with arrows and numbered according to the disulfide bond (Table 2) under the sequences. N-linked glycosylation sites are numbered in green. Residues known to interact with CD81 are marked with small blue circles. The numbering corresponds to the HCV H77 polyprotein. B) Comparison with a class II fusion protein of known structure. The experimentally determined secondary structure of SFV E1 taken from the crystal structure (PDB 2ALA, [49]), shown with symbols (arrows or spirals) above the sequence alignment, was compared with secondary structure predictions for the E1 ectodomain of selected alphaviruses. Experimentally determined \u03b2-strands in DI, DII and DIII are colored red, black and blue, respectively. The red frames indicate the consensus predicted strands in DI, for easier comparison with panel A.
