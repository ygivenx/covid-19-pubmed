The details of the selection criteria of the population and the methods of testing have been described elsewhere.23 Volunteers were requested to attend three scheduled visits at 6-month intervals for 1 year to investigate the natural history of AGWs. At each visit, the volunteers underwent a clinical examination by trained clinicians to identify whether there were AGWs lesions in cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal and perianal sites of women or in external genital, anal and perianal sites of men. For cases that were diagnosed with AGWs based on their clinical appearance, biopsy samples were obtained to be tested for HPV DNA and genotyped by PCR assay. The kits tested for 13 oncogenic HPV types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68) and 3 non-oncogenic HPV types (HPV 6, 11 and 66).

The huge missing report rate can probably be explained by the following factors: first, in China, AGWs is a non-notifiable disease, and thus, reports of AGWs in the NNDRS were not carefully monitored and managed; and second, due to a variety of psychological and social reasons, patients with AGWs might not seek health care or may select private clinics that have no access to NNDRS for treatment. As decades are needed to observe the effectiveness of HPV vaccines against cervical cancers at the population level, the NNDRS for AGWs in China should be strengthened and monitored so that the effectiveness of HPV vaccines can be evaluated based on the incidence of AGWs over a short period.",

This age-specific variation may be due to sexual mixing patterns, where younger women tended to have sex with older men. Another potential cause may be that females had a shorter incubation period of HPV 6 or 11 than men. After the incident HPV 6 or 11 infection, the median time of developing AGWs was 2.9 months in women, whereas it was 11 months in males.28, 29 The longer period in men may be the reason why no male cases were observed during the 1-year period of our prospective study.",

Furthermore, the follow-up period is only 1 year in this study, which is similar to the median time from incident HPV 6 or 11 infection to the lesion development among males,28, 29 coupled with that men who contracted AGWs are more easily to recognize the lesions and refuse to continue the visits.
