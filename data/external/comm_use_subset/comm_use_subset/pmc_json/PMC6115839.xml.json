            "text": "Interferon inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been shown to be essential restriction factors against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses (reviewed in [1,2]), including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [3]. Recently, we and others discovered that IFITMs not only block HIV-1 entry into target cells but also and more potently, diminish HIV-1 infectivity in viral producer cells [4,5,6]. The current proposed model for the mechanism of action of IFITM proteins on HIV-1 infectivity includes negative imprinting, in which IFITMs are incorporated into virions [4,5], as well as impaired HIV-1 envelope (Env) processing [6]. Subsequent investigations showed that IFITM proteins can distinctly inhibit HIV-1 with different tropisms; in particular, it was shown that some CCR5 tropic viruses, including those of transmitted founders (T/Fs), were relatively resistant to IFITM-mediated impairment of HIV-1 infectivity and entry [7,8]. Interestingly, Neil and colleagues reported that IFITM1 is more potent to restrict entry of CCR5 viruses whereas IFITM2 and IFITM3 are more effective to block entry of CXCR4 viruses, at least in U87 cells [8]. These results are apparently different from some of the earlier reports in Jurkat cells, SupT1 cells and HeLa TZM-bl cells [6,9], where IFITM2 and IFITM3 were shown to be generally more potent than IFITM1 to inhibit HIV-1, regardless of co-receptor usage.",

To interrogate the role of endogenous IFITMs, we knocked down IFITMs in human PBMCs and purified CD4+ T cells and determined the contribution of IFITMs in IFN-mediated inhibition of multiple and single round of HIV-1 infection. Our results showed that IFITM proteins do not distinguish co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to inhibit HIV-1 entry but highlight a more important role of IFITMs in diminishing viral infectivity.",

We observed that HIV-1 GFP-pseudotypes bearing the Env of NL4.3, HXB2, 89.6, AD8 or JRFL showed a similar trend of inhibition by three IFITM orthologs, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1, regardless of their CXCR4 or CCR5 tropisms (Figure 1B). The extent of inhibition was approximately 2~3 fold for IFITM2 and IFITM3 and <30% for IFITM1, respectively, which were comparable to the original report by Neil and colleagues [8]. We noticed that, while the CCR5-using JRFL HIV-1 was relatively less sensitive to inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3 compared with the CXCR4-using viruses HXB2 and NL4.3, another CCR5-using HIV-1 primary isolate, AD8, was as sensitive as HXB2 and NL4.3 to inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3. In no case, however, have we found that IFITM1 exhibited a stronger inhibition of any viruses, including CCR5 viruses, than IFITM2 and IFITM3 did (Figure 1B,C). Note that the efficiency of entry by the dual tropic 89.6 in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells was extremely low, as measured by GFP-positive cell population (data not shown); therefore, the result was not informative thus excluded from Figure 1C.",

The HIV-inGLuc system is highly sensitive and quantitative compared to the classical colorimetric assays, including fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry; and because the expression of inGLuc solely relies on infection of new target cells, attributed to an insertion of antisense orientation of Gluc cassette in reporter vector [14], this assay measures a single-round HIV-1 infection.",

To achieve infection of both CXCR4 and CCR5 HIV-1 strains, we utilized a HuT78 cell line, which expresses an endogenous level of CD4 and CXCR4 [15] but was transiently transduced to express CCR5 and different IFITMs. After being confirmed to express an equal level of IFITM proteins in these cells as shown in Figure 3A, these cells were infected with HIV-inGLuc reporter viruses bearing Env proteins of NL4.3, AD8 or 89.6.

The efficiencies of NL4.3, AD8 and 89.6 infection, as measured by their original luciferase activities in parental Hut-78/CCR5 cells, were plotted in Figure 3C, showing that AD8 had the highest rate of infection, ~4~fold and ~50-fold above HIV-1 NL4.3 and 89.6, respectively.",

Accumulatively, these data showed that IFITM2 and IFITM3 are strong inhibitors of HIV-1 entry in CD4+ HIV-relevant T lymphocytes and monocytes, similar to what was observed in U87 cells.",

We observed that the levels of FLAG-tagged IFITMs were comparable to those of untagged IFITMs, the levels of both corresponded to approximately 300 U (for IFITM2/3) or 1000 U (for IFITM1) IFN\u03b12b-induced endogenous IFITMs in SupT1 cells (Figure 3G). We next examined the effect of these FLAG-tagged IFITMs and WT IFITMs on infection of SupT1 cells by using HIV-1 NL4.3 inGLuc pseudotypes and observed that FLAG-tagged IFITMs were generally 25\u201330% more potent to inhibit HIV-1 infection compared with the corresponding WT IFITMs (Figure 3H).

Because short-hairpin RNAs against IFITMs (shRNA IFITMs) exhibit cross-knockdown activities against different IFITM orthologs [6], making the evaluation of the contributions of individual IFITMs to HIV-1 entry challenging, we decided to knock down all three IFITMs altogether by using a mixed pool of shRNAs and compared the overall function of IFITMs on infection of CXCR4 and CCR5 HIV-1 strains, i.e., NL4.3 and AD8, respectively. Human PBMCs of two healthy donors were transiently transduced with lentiviral pseudovirions expressing a mixed pool of human IFITM shRNAs (IFITM1, 2 and 3) and the IFITM knockdown efficiency, in the presence or absence of IFN\u03b12b, was assessed and confirmed by western blotting shown in Figure 4A. Single-round infection assays using inGLuc pseudotypes showed that in the absence of IFN\u03b12b, knockdown of IFITMs in donor 1 and donor 2 (Figure 4B,C) modestly increased HIV-1 NL4.3 entry (~50%), yet more potently elevated entry of AD8 (~2\u20133-fold). Notably, treatment of PBMCs with IFN\u03b12b decreased NL4.3 and AD8 entry by roughly 2-fold in the shRNA control, yet had very modest effect, approximately 30\u201350% increase, on PBMCs treated with shRNA IFITMs (Figure 4B,C). These results suggested that IFITMs do not significantly contribute to the IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 entry and implied that other ISGs as yet to be discovered in target PBMCs are likely involved in restricting HIV-1 entry. The ~2-fold increase in HIV-1 entry as a result of IFITM knockdown was actually consistent with the ~2\u20133-fold inhibition by IFITM overexpression in most cell lines, including U87, HuT78, SupT1 and THP-1 cells shown above.

We purified human CD4+ T cells from PBMCs of two additional donors, donor 3 and donor 4, and utilized the same set of shRNAs to knock down IFITMs in purified CD4+ cells; cells were subsequently treated with IFN\u03b12b for 24 h before being infected with HIV-inGLuc or infectious NL4.3. The knockdown efficiency of IFITMs was evaluated and confirmed by flow cytometry using mixed anti-IFITM antibodies shown in Figure 4D,G. We observed that IFITM proteins were indeed induced by type I IFN and that treatment of cells with IFITM shRNAs efficiently knocked down the IFITM protein expression (Figure 4D,G). Type I IFN greatly suppressed the replication of HIV-1 NL4.3 in shRNA control cells, that is, by 5- and 10-fold in donor 3 and donor 4, respectively, and knockdown of IFITMs attenuated the IFN-mediated restriction of HIV-1 replication to 2~2.5-fold (Figure 4E,H), implicating that IFITMs indeed play a critical role in IFN-mediated restriction of HIV-1 replication. In one-round HIV-1 inGLuc infection assays, which was performed side-by-side, we observed a ~2-fold reduction of HIV-1 infection in IFN\u03b12b-treated CD4+ T cells of both donors and that knockdown of IFITMs did not significantly rescue the IFN-mediated inhibition on HIV-1 infection (approximately 50%) (Figure 4F,I), suggesting that endogenous IFITMs in target CD+ T cells do not significantly contribute to IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 entry. Taken together, these data, combined with previous reports from our group and others showing that IFITMs potently impaired HIV-1 infectivity in viral producer cells [4,5,6], reinforce the notion that IFITMs do not drastically block HIV-1 entry in target CD4+ cells, which explained, in part, why HIV-1 was originally not found to be sensitive to IFITM restriction by Brass et al.

However, recent studies from HIV and other viruses have suggested additional mechanisms of action for IFITMs, that is, IFITMs can act in viral producer cells and/or viral particles to impair viral infectivity [4,5,6,17,18].

However, long-term HIV-1 replication assay revealed that IFITM proteins indeed potently suppress HIV-1 spread in SupT1 and other cells, as well as block cell-to-cell transmission [3,5,6,22,23]. The discrepancy was partially resolved by several recent studies, including ours, showing that IFITM proteins mainly act in viral producer cells and/or in IFITM-bearing virions by diminishing HIV-1 infectivity [4,5,6]. In a recent study, our collaborator Chen Liang\u2019s group has found that some CCR5 viruses, including AD8, YU-2 and certain T/F viruses, are relatively resistant to IFITM-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity compared with some CXCR4 viruses, such as NL4.3 and dual tropic 89.6 [7]. Interestingly, a recent study by Neil and colleagues reported that the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 entry in target cells is co-receptor dependent, showing that IFITM1 preferentially inhibited entry of CCR5-using HIV-1, including T/F viruses, whereas IFITM2 and 3 were more potent to block entry of CXCR4-using HIV-1 isolates [8], which differed from some of the previous reports [4,6,7,24]. To clarify the discrepancies for the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 entry, in this work we generated a set of U87.CD4 cell lines expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4, along with different IFITMs similar to those reported by Neil and colleagues and applied GFP as well as intron gaussia luciferase reporter viruses to examine the effects of different IFITMs on the entry of some representative HIV-1 strains and primary isolates. In addition to U87 cells, we also tested the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 infection of more physiologically relevant human CD4+ T cells and monocytes. We observed that, despite the comparable IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression in different cell line systems, the patterns of IFITM inhibition on HIV-1 entry\u2014as ranked by their potency of inhibition\u2014remained the same, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1, irrespective of the virus strains tested and the cell lines used.",

In this respect, our results may favor a model that HIV-1 fusion predominantly occurs in endosome, as having been shown by Melikyan\u2019s group and others, regardless of co-receptor usages [25,26]. However, we must stress that this mechanism of HIV-1 entry currently remains controversial [27,28,29,30]. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of IFITM2 and 3 in endosomes may not necessarily be associated with their inhibition of HIV-1 entry [31,32]. It is possible that IFITM1 is intrinsically weaker than IFITM2 and IFITM3 to suppress entry of HIV-1 and other viruses [16,33,34], regardless of the viral entry pathways. It has been frequently demonstrated that overexpression of IFITM1 can result in its abundant expression in endolysosomes, in addition to the plasma membrane; however, its effect on entry of many viruses tested still remains poor, supporting that the intrinsic less potent effect of IFITM1 on entry of HIV-1 and other viruses [2,35] may be due to its extended C-terminal amino acid sequence [6,36,37].",

            "text": "One of the most exciting yet highly controversial findings over the past few years is that T/F viruses are more resistant to the host innate immunity, including restriction by IFITMs [38,39]. T/F virus is a single variant selected from a diverse pool of HIV-1 quasispecies during the establishment of early infection and is responsible for establishment of primary infection, bottleneck transmission and virus spread [40,41]. Indeed, we and others have reported that some of HIV-1 T/F strains are relatively resistant to IFITM3-mediated inhibition of viral infectivity [7,8]; however, the detailed effect of IFITMs in target cells on entry of T/F viruses is less clear. In this work, we analyzed the effects of IFITMs on entry of 20 subtype B and 12 global clades T/F viruses (all CCR5 tropic except two dual tropic viruses) by using the highly sensitive HIV-inGLuc system and we observed that despite their diverse entry efficiency, IFITM1 was consistently less potent in restricting entry of all T/F isolates compared with IFITM2 and IFITM3. These results therefore argue against the finding by Foster et al. that IFITM1 preferentially blocks entry of CCR5 viruses [8], including T/Fs. Our results may also suggest that T/F viruses utilize the same entry pathway as that of chronic primary isolates and lab-adapted strains. The fact that some T/F viruses were even more potently inhibited by IFITMs, especially IFITM2 and IFITM3, compared with those of the lab-adapted NL4.3 and HXB2 viruses, argues that IFITM1 may be inherently less potent to block HIV-1 entry. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some of the effect we observed could be cell type-dependent. While it remains to be established whether or not T/F viruses are truly refractory to inhibition by type I IFN, including IFN-induced IFITM proteins, one recent study reported that subtype C T/F viruses failed to show higher replicative capacity and resistance to IFN-mediated inhibition [39]. This finding, along with some others [42,43,44], raise the possibility that T/F viruses may not be universally refractory to type I IFN as having been previously thought [38]. Using the perfectly matched T/F viruses and chronic viruses and testing them in different and more physiologically relevant cell systems are necessary to address this important issue.",

We speculated that this could be due to the expression levels of IFITM proteins in our system versus those in Neil and colleague\u2019s study [8]. In addition, the N-terminal FLAG-tag in our IFITMs could contribute to some of the differences observed. Indeed, we have observed that FLAG-tagged IFITMs are approximately 25\u201330% more potent than their WTs to inhibit HIV-1 infection; however, the order of potency in inhibition for the untagged WT IFITMs and FLAG-IFITMs remains the same, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1. Another possibility, which also needs to be explored, is whether or not some HIV-1 accessory proteins present in pseudotyped viruses could influence the effect of different IFITMs on HIV-1 infection.",

In addition, we showed that the type I IFN itself was not highly effective to block HIV-1 entry, as compared its suppression of HIV-1 replication\u2014based on results from both PBMCs and purified CD4+ T cells. Overall, the results presented here, along with our previous study that compared the functional role of IFITMs in viral producer cells and target cells in parallel [6], led us to the conclusion that the predominant effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 is in viral producer cells that diminishes the viral infectivity but not in target cells to block viral entry.

(A) FLAG-tagged IFITM1, 2, 3 expression levels in U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 stable cell lines were examined by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. \u03b2-actin served as loading control. (B,C) One-round pLenti-GFP HIV-1 infection assay was performed by infecting indicated cells with pLenti-GFP pseudotypes bearing Env of interest and percentages of GFP+ cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Relative entry efficiency was calculated by comparing the percentages of HIV-1 GFP+ cells expressing IFITMs with that of pQCXIH vector controls. Note that CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4.3 and HXB2 and dual tropic virus 89.6 were examined in U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells (B); CCR5 tropic viruses AD8 and JRFL and dual tropic 89.6 were examined in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells (C). (D,E) Single-round infection of HIV-1 NL4.3, AD8 and 89.6 and MLV 10A1 was measured by using HIV-inGLuc reporter pseudotypes in U87.CD4.CXCR4 (D) or U87.CD4.CCR5 cells (E).

(A\u2013C) PBMCs from two healthy human donors were activated by 20 IU/mL IL-2 and 5 \u00b5g/mL PHAP for 3 days and were transduced with lentiviral shRNA control or pooled shRNA IFITMs for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 500 IU/mL IFN\u03b12b for 24 h or left untreated and were infected with HIV-inGluc bearing Env of NL4.3 or AD8 for 24 h before being collected for immunoblotting (A), or for measuring the luciferase activities (B,C). Relative entry was calculated by setting the luciferase activities of cells transduced by shRNA control pseudotypes and untreated with IFN\u03b12b to 1.0. Different comparisons were performed as indicated, with p values shown. (D through I) CD4+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs and transduced with lentiviral shRNA control or pooled shRNAs against IFITM1, 2 and 3. Cells were treated with 500 IU/mL IFN\u03b1 for 24 h or were left untreated. The expression levels of IFITMs were determined by flow cytometry shown in (D,G) for two different donors. For replication assay, cells were infected with infectious NL4.3 (E,H) for 48 h and harvested virions were used to infect HeLa-TZM cells, with firefly luciferase activities being measured 24\u201348 h after infection. For one-round entry assay, cells were infected with HIV-inGLuc reporter viruses (F,I) and gaussia luciferase activities were directly measured from the harvested supernatants. Relative infectivity and relative entry were determined by setting the values of shRNA control and IFN\u03b1-untreated cells to 1.0.
