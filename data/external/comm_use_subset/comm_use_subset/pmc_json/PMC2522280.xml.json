            "text": "Airline networks provide fast transportation every day for goods and people; however, these connections also provide pathways for the spread of diseases [1]. Recent real and hypothetical threats have increased interest about the role airline transportation has in the spread of HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza, and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) [2]\u2013[7]. Nevertheless, the role that airline transportation has on infectious disease epidemiology is not yet completely understood. Global cross-continental disease transmission is more likely by airline travel than by other means of travel, such as by boat. Additionally, air travel is the main form of transportation to remote areas such as small towns in Alaska, Siberia, and certain islands in the Pacific [1]. In these remote areas, public health interventions follow the same airline transportation routes as the spread of disease, meaning these routes to remote areas cannot be ignored. On the other hand, local transportation patterns might be more critical for the continental spread of influenza, and national grounding of air transport is believed to have little impact on fast disease propagation [8].",

            "text": "In their study, Guimer\u00e0 et al. [1] emphasized the importance of understanding the connectedness of the world's populated areas. They showed that the most-connected cities are not necessarily the largest but play a critical role, not only for economic and cultural purposes, but also for global public health. Therefore, the role of both large and small airlines in providing community connections needs to be better understood. For example, researchers of global disease spread base their models on different numbers of airports, ranging from 52 to the entire sample of 3100 connected cities [2]\u2013[4], [9], [10]. Relying on either extreme might lead to flawed results. On one hand, having too few cities could lead to researchers' missing important pathways that could be critical in disease spread. Samples from networks have been shown to lose many important properties of the entire network, such as scale-free degree distribution, and lead to bias in the main network measures [11]\u2013[14], which might bias the patterns of disease transmission. On the other hand, using the entire sample of 3100 air transport connected cities leads to connectedness bias, because two cities can be weakly connected by air travel but heavily connected by ground transport. Finally, as was shown by Guimer\u00e0 et al. [1], some of the most-connected cities are not necessarily the largest and, conversely, some of the largest cities (and thus very important for their role in epidemics) might not be the most connected.",

For example, New York City includes data from John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport. As another example, Washington, DC includes data from Dulles International Airport and Ronald Reagan National Airport but not Baltimore/Washington International Airport. The full OAG data set contains 3883 airport codes; however, a number of codes refer to train stations or bus stops. Additionally, some small airports (<100 passengers/day) are located on small islands for which population size was not available, and some airports are disconnected (i.e., do not have flights) from the main connected component. In our analysis, we have included only those locations from the largest connected network component for which we could obtain information on both flight volume and population size, resulting in a list of 2904 locations.

The highest volume and highest betweenness samples share no less than 50%. In fact, the percentage of shared cities increases as the sample size gets larger than 1000. The highest betweenness and degree cities show a similar pattern. On the other hand, samples based on the population show little commonality (less than 30%) with samples based on other characteristics when the sample size is smaller than 100 cities. This percentage increases as the sample size increases. It is monotonic for population-volume and population-degree, but is not monotonic for population-betweenness. A sample as large as 1500 cities (about one-half of the total network) is needed to ensure that 50% of the cities appear on all four lists. If a researcher wants to include the cities that are within the top 100 of both population size and flight volume, he or she will need to have a sample size of about 165 cities (Figure 5). The multiplier generally decreases with increasing sample size; however, we observe that a nonlinear relationship between sample size and betweenness produces a bump in the three curves involving betweenness.

An example of selection discrepancy between population size vs. flight volume is Washington, DC, which is not a part of the 52 largest city sample but is a part of the 52 largest volume sample. The results also show that larger sample sizes tend to produce smaller FPTs, possibly due to the additional routes through which the disease can travel. Furthermore, when the sample size is large enough, there is no difference between the results from the volume-based and the population-based samples. However, when the sample size is small, air traffic connections to some cities can be inadequately represented, and the disease transmission time can be significantly biased. Most of the discrepancies occur in the small, population-based samples. This is especially true for the large cities that are relatively weakly connected, such as St. Petersburg, Russia, where the FPT is about 130 days for a sample of 52 population-based cities, compared to 94 days in the full network. This difference is more than a month, which is very important for public health preparedness.

About 150 cities are sufficient for adequate coverage of the major world regions. The results of the simulations suggest that samples based on air traffic volume better describe sample characteristics but can have poor regional coverage and thus need to be complemented by the samples based on population size, betweenness, and clustering characteristics. Next, one could add remote locations for answering questions about specific regions. We have shown through dynamic simulations that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza.",

            "text": "Although the use of 52 cities was justified for the purposes of previous studies [17] and illustrated the role of airline transportation as a major factor in global disease spread, the models that aim to answer more specific questions need to consider a more systematic approach. For example, for practical optimization of the global distribution of antiviral medicine, mathematical models are more likely to consider the role of individual regions or cities in the context of the global spread of disease. If a model is based on a small number of cities, such as in the Rvachev-Longini model, the role of individual cities in the global spread will be underestimated. Incidentally, in a recent paper by Kern\u00e9is et al. [17], the authors consider the role of different cities in a global epidemic under different disease characteristics. We would argue that some of their conclusions about the speed of the global spread and the behavior of different city types would change if the authors had considered a more representative set of cities including large metropolitan areas with little traffic as well as smaller but extensively connected cities.",

The results also show that the bias is smoothly dependent on the population size for all sampling methods and there is no \u201cnatural\u201d threshold suggesting the optimal choice of the sample size. For each objective, the \u201coptimal\u201d sample size should be the balance of the scale at which the conclusions are made and the appropriateness of using airline transportation as the basis for human travel flows. One should keep in mind that very small airports can reflect insignificant private traffic flows, while most of the regional transportation is based on ground traffic. Although a large number of network characteristics could be studied with respect to the network samples, we have selected the ones that are clearly defined and were shown to be related to the spread of diseases, innovation, or information. Some measures were inevitably left out. For example, Ghani et al. [18] and Ghani and Garnett [19] demonstrated that network measures such as assortative mixing patterns and population representativeness were strongly affected by the way in which nodes were selected for inclusion in the simulated network. We did not consider the estimation of \u201cmixing\u201d matrices because the actual definition can be ambiguous. Mixing matrices can be defined in terms of flight volume, population size, region, etc. A number of other network measures can be found in Wasserman and Faust [20].",

The analysis is based on the airline network, and its generalizability to other networks such as social or ground transportation might be limited. However, this study is the first attempt to use a systematic approach for the selection of a network sample for dynamic modeling. Although the actual curves and the quantitative results would be different for each specific study, the methodology of selecting a sample based on individual and network characteristics will guide future studies. Another limitation is that in this study the entire network of connected cities is known. Although complete or nearly complete network information is sometimes available in transportation studies, this is usually not the case in social network studies. Nevertheless, having an estimate of which percent of the population the sample represents allows one to extrapolate the network characteristic curves to what they are likely to be in the entire population.",

Orthogonal regression minimizes the orthogonal distance from the regression line as opposed to minimizing vertical distance in ordinary regression. The spread of the residuals is comparable to the range of the data indicating high variation of the flight volume for cities of the similar sizes. Orthogonal regression provides a useful reference line because it treats flight volume and city size as equal variables and could be viewed as the principle component capturing the essence of the relationship between the two variables. At the same time ordinary regression considers flight volume as a function of the city size. The lower slope in the regression line compared to the orthogonal regression indicates that there are many large cities that have a small flight volume as well as small cities with high flight volume.",
