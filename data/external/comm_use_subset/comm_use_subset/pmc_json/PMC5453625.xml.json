In contrast to beta and gamma herpesviruses which exhibit restricted or limited cell-type tropism, the alphaherpesviruses have a much broader host range and are able to infect a wide variety of cell types [2, 3]. For example, the representative alphaherpesvirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), shows low species specificity and is able to infect human and non-human cells alike [4]. The capability of HSV to infect most human cell types is recognized as an important contributing factor to its high prevalence in the world populations [5]. Pseudorabies virus (PRV), another member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, is reported to infect both farming (e. g. pigs, sheep, etc) and pet (e. g. cats) animals [6]. Herpes B virus, an alphaherpesvirus that causes mild or asymptomatic infections in macaques, can cross the species barriers and lead to fatal diseases in humans [7].",

An early step in the infection of the alphaherpesvirus is the engagement of host receptors by the virus glycoprotein D (gD) [5]. The broad tropism of alphaherpesvirus is, therefore, at least partially the result of its capacity to recognize and bind multiple cell surface molecules via gD [8]. Thus far, six gD receptors have been identified. These include 3-O-sulfonated-heparan sulfate (3-O-S-HS) [9]; the herpes virus entry mediator A (HveA, also known as HVEM), a TNF receptor-related protein [10]; and three immunoglobulin superfamily members: HveB (PRR2, nectin-2) [11], HveC (PRR1, nectin-1) and HveD (PRV, CD155) [12]. Of these renowned host molecules, nectin-1 serves as a broadly used receptor mediating the entry of all of the commonly tested viruses, including HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), PRV, and bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV-1) [12\u201314]. In addition, nectin-1 was also identified as the primary receptor for the HSV-1 infection of rat and mouse sensory neurons [15].",

            "text": "Nectin-1 is an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like cell adhesion molecule [16]. It plays important roles in organizing the intercellular junctions by self homodimerization and/or by heterodimerization with other nectin and nectin-like molecules (e. g. nectin-3, nectin-4, nectin-like 1, etc.) [17]. Nectin-1 is highly conserved in mammalian animals. The swine and human nectin-1 share 96% amino acid identity, and both homologs are able to mediate the entry of HSV-1, HSV-2, PRV and BHV-1 [13, 18]. It is demonstrated that the gD proteins of these alphaherpesviruses bind to nectin-1 with nanomolar affinities [13, 19]. The detailed binding mode between HSV gD and human nectin-1 has been successfully illustrated in several previous studies [20\u201322]. The gD molecule is composed of a V-set Ig-like (or IgV-like) core and long N- and C-terminal extensions, It utilizes both terminal-extension elements to interact with nectin-1. The receptor, with three Ig-like domains arranged into a rod-shaped structure, projects its membrane-distal IgV domain for gD engagement[21\u201323]. It is notable that the whole gD footprint in nectin-1 overlaps extensively with the nectin-1 dimerization interface, which explains a novel mechanism of exploiting the host cell-adhesion functions by HSV for virus spread and infection [21, 22].",

Several previous studies demonstrated that gD binding to its receptors could displace the C-terminal pro-fusion domain (PFD) to activate the fusion executor composed of glycoproteins B, H and L (or gB, gH and gL) [24, 25]. Interestingly, the structures of HSV gD in the receptor bound forms (with nectin-1 and HVEM, respectively) and a dimeric free gD structure indeed reveal that receptor engagement would displace the gD C-terminal loop [20\u201322, 25, 27]. These structural investigations pave the way for understanding the basis of gD recognition of multiple cellular receptors and thereby of the broad cell tropism of alphaherpesviruses. Nevertheless, the previous studies are almost exclusively based on HSV gDs. The structural and functional features of other alphaherpesviral gDs remain poorly characterized. These are interesting scientific issues awaiting answers in the herpesvirus field, because gD homologs of the prevalent alphaherpesviruses (e. g. HSV, PRV, BHV-1, etc.) only share very low (22\u201333%) amino acid sequence identities [19].",

Despite the significant homology between PRV and HSV, the two viruses belong to different genera (PRV in the Varicellovirus genus and HSV in the Simplexvirus genus, respectively [1]). In the current study, we show that PRV infects host cells via both human and swine nectin-1, but not with human HVEM. PRV gD engages the human and swine receptors with similar affinities. We further demonstrate that a gD variant lacking the C-terminal membrane-proximal residues exhibited much higher affinity for nectin-1, which we believe represents an inspiring evidence that the PRV gD C-terminal loop likely also plays a role in triggering the virus/cell membrane fusion as observed for HSV PFD. The structures of PRV gD in the unbound and the nectin-1-bound forms were then solved at high resolutions. The PRV protein exhibits overall similar 3D fold and nectin-1 binding mode to its HSV counterpart but utilizes different gD residues (from those of HSV) for nectin-1 engagement. Finally, we also conducted a mutagenesis study using the interface-residue mutants of nectin-1, which in combination with the structural observations, provide the basis of receptor recognition by PRV gD.",

Several previous studies demonstrated that both human (HU-nectin-1) and swine nectin-1 (SW-nectin-1) serve as a cellular receptor for PRV [13, 28]. As a step towards understanding the basis of receptor recognition by the virus, we first reconfirmed the nectin-1 mediated viral entry using the PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 (28) in CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cell lacks any of the known alphaherpesvirus receptors and is therefore resistant to PRV infection [29]. Transient expression of HU- and SW-nectin-1 in CHO-K1, however, suffices the cells for PRV entry. In the presence of either the human or the swine receptors, PRV infection with significant cytopathic effects was observed; whereas HU-HVEM failed to promote the entry of the virus (Fig 1A). This is consistent with previous reports showing that nectin-1, but not HVEM or 3-O-S-HS, could mediate the PRV infection [8].",

            "text": "To gain further insight into the PRV-gD/nectin-1 interaction, we set out to characterize their binding features using the real-time surface plasmon resonance (SRP) assays. Previous studies have shown that, by truncation of the C-terminal trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domains, the entire ectodomain of PRV gD could be yielded as a recombinant protein in the soluble form [13]. Following the same strategy, we successfully expressed and purified a truncated PRV gD protein spanning residues 1\u2013337 (hereafter referred to as gD337) using a baculovirus expression system (Fig 2A and 2B). Noted that the residue numberings for HSV gD in previous structural studies are based on the mature protein [21, 22], the numberings for PRV gD amino acids in the current study are therefore also based on the mature protein (unless otherwise specified) to facilitate sequence comparison (Fig 2A). The ecto-domain proteins of both HU- and SW-nectin-1 prepared from E. coli were individually immobilized on the chip and tested for the interaction with gD337. As expected, the gD protein potently interacts with both receptors, exhibiting typical slow-on/slow-off binding kinetics (Fig 2C). The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were determined to be 191 nM with HU-nectin-1 (Kon, 1.41 \u00d7 105 M-1s-1; Koff, 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 s-1) and 301 nM with SW-nectin-1 (Kon, 1.46 \u00d7 105 M-1s-1; Koff, 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 s-1), respectively. Therefore, PRV gD recognizes the human and swine receptors with essentially the same binding affinity. This result is consistent with our observation in the cell fusion assay which shows that nectin-1 of the two species mediates gD-dependent CHO-K1 fusion with similar efficiencies shown in the previous section. Furthermore, the determined Kd values are also in good accordance with a previous study reporting an affinity of approximate 130 nM for the PRV-gD/HU-nectin-1 interactions [13].",

This new construct spans the gD amino acids 1\u2013284 (hereafter referred to as gD284) (Fig 2A). The resultant protein was similarly prepared via the baculovirus expression system and purified to homogeneity (Fig 2B). When tested using SPR, this short form of PRV gD exhibited significantly increased binding avidity to nectin-1. The calculated Kds of gD284 to the human and swine receptors were 16.1 nM (Kon, 7.25 \u00d7 105 M-1s-1; Koff, 1.17 \u00d7 10\u22122 s-1) and 18.4 nM (Kon, 1.15 \u00d7 106 M-1s-1; Koff, 2.11 \u00d7 10\u22122 s-1), respectively (Fig 2C). These values represent an approximate 12\u201316 fold enhancement in affinity in comparison to gD337.

Superimposition of our structure with previously reported HSV gD structures revealed well-aligned core domain and terminal extensions (Fig 3B). Despite of the low sequence identity, a majority of the secondary structure elements, including the core-strands and most of the extension helices, were parallel-formed in PRV and HSV gDs. The PRV structure, however, contains an extra \u03b12' helix in the C-terminal extension. In addition, while both PRV and HSV gDs encompass a core \u03b11' helix, their steric positions are quite different in the structures. In PRV gD, helix \u03b11' is located between strands C'' and D; whereas the HSV-gD \u03b11' helix lines before strand C, directly following the \u03b11 helix (Fig 3B and 3C). Further structural variations between PRV and HSV gDs were observed for the equivalent \u03b13 helices and their terminal loops. The former showed a small variance in the conformation, while the latter exhibited large orientation differences (Fig 3B). Facilitated by the structure-based sequence alignment, it is notable that HSV gD encompasses a much longer N-terminal loop (or N-loop) than PRV gD (Fig 3C). Noted that HSV gD reconstitutes its N-loop into a hairpin structure for HVEM binding [27], the lack of an N-loop of sufficient size in PRV gD therefore coincides well with its incompetence of utilizing HVEM.",

Furthermore, the receptor CC' loop also showed quite different conformations when bound to the viral ligands of PRV and HSV (Fig 4C). Noted that PRV gD contains an extra \u03b12' helix which is projected outwards for engagement of the receptor, the SW-nectin-1 CC' loop therefore adopted an alternative conformation to accommodate the bulged helix.

We therefore scrutinized this binding interface to delineate the amino acid interaction details between the two binding entities. Along the nectin-1 CC'C''FG sheet, the major receptor-engagement components of gD include its N-loop, the \u03b11' helix in the IgV-core, and helices \u03b12', \u03b13', \u03b13 and the \u03b13'/\u03b13 loop in its C-terminal extension (Fig 5A). In the N-loop, two aromatic residues F11 and W22 were projected outwards for receptor binding. They were found to be packed against nectin-1 amino acids K61, Q64, I80, N82, M85-S88, and F129, thereby providing important hydrophobic interactions (Fig 5B). It should be noted that F11 of gD is located in the N-loop region that was shown to undergo large conformational changes after receptor binding (Fig 4B). We believe the subsequent interactions of F11 with nectin-1 K61 and F129 are the major forces stabilizing the observed N-loop orientation in the complex structure. As for the \u03b11' and \u03b12' helices, each component presents one amino acid (T119 in \u03b11' and Y183 in \u03b12') towards the receptor, contacting mainly the nectin-1 residues G73-K75, I123, E125, N133, and E135 via multiple Van der Waals (vdw) interactions. In addition, the \u03b11'-residue T119 also forms a weak H-bond with nectin-1 E125 (Fig 5C). Further PRV-gD/SW-nectin-1 interactions were contributed by the \u03b13', \u03b13 helices and their intervening loop, which position multiple residues, including M201-R202, P206-Y208, V216, and Y219, to interact with nectin-1 amino acids T63-Q64, Q76-N77, I80, S88, L90-A91, A127-P130 and N133 (Fig 5D). In addition to providing extensive vdw contacts, these amino acids further stick the viral ligand to the receptor by creating an inter-molecule H-bond network. In total, five strong and two weak H-bonds were observed to form, arising from PRV gD M201 and R202 interacting with SW-nectin-1 Q76, N77 and A91, gD P206 with nectin-1 Q64, and gD Y208 with nectin-1 T63 and A127, respectively (Fig 5D). It is notable that the identified interface residues in the receptor are absolutely conserved between HU- and SW-nectin-1 (Fig 5E), explaining the similar affinities of the two receptors for PRV gD binding.",

In the context that HU- and SW-nectin-1 are equally competent in binding with PRV gD (Fig 2B) and their interface residues contacting gD are absolutely conserved (Fig 5E), we therefore utilized the human homolog for the test in our mutagenesis study. In consistent with the structural observation that F129 provides the maximum amount of intermolecule contacts (45 contacts, Table 2), the F129A mutation almost completely abrogated the gD/nectin-1 binding (Kd > 40 \u03bcM) (Fig 6A) and therefore the gD/nectin-1 dependent cell fusion (Fig 6B). The functional indispensability of nectin-1 F129 in PRV-gD engagement was also demonstrated in a previous study[30].",

Accordingly, substitution of the two residues with alanine decreased, but not abolished, the gD/nectin-1 interaction. The affinities of the nectin-1 N77A and M85A for gD337 were determined to be 3.4 \u03bcM and 2.8 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig 6A), and the two mutants remain competent in the gD-mediated cell fusion, though with decreased efficiencies (Fig 6B). It is notable that nectin-1 N77 and M85 interact more extensively with HSV-gD (e. g. 42 and 33 contacts, respectively with HSV-2 gD) than with PRV-gD (29 and 20 contacts, respectively) (Table 2), echoing a previous study reporting their important roles in binding the HSV ligand but much compromised contributions to the engagement of the PRV protein [31]. These mutagenesis data coincide well with our structural observation, which conversely verified the PRV-gD/nectin-1 binding mode observed in the complex structure. It is also noteworthy that nectin-1 N77A and M85A engage PRV-gD with a fast-on/fast-off mode (Fig 6A), forming contrast to the wild type protein which shows both slow association and dissociation rates. Similar phenomena of altered Kon/Koff rates have also been observed in other virus-ligand/receptor binding pairs when their interface residues are mutated [22].",

HSV-1, HSV-2, PRV and BHV-1 are all reported to utilize nectin-1 for cell entry [8, 12, 13, 30, 31]. The molecular basis of nectin-1 recognition by the envelope gD proteins of these viruses, therefore, is an interesting but yet an unresolved issue. Previous studies focused on HSV, a member of the Simplexvirus genus in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. The structures of both the free HSV gD and its complex with nectin-1 are reported at high resolutions [6, 21, 22, 25]. Nevertheless, the structural and functional features of other alphaherpesviral gDs remains poorly understood. In this study, we have reported the first structure of gD derived from a Varicellovirus member of the alphaherpesviruses, the PRV. Despite of its low sequence identity to the HSV homologs (~ 22%), PRV gD reserves the canonical gD features, including an IgV-like core with a kinked C\u201d strand and the surface-exposed N- and C-terminal extensions. We further solved the complex structure of PRV gD bound with SW-nectin-1, which revealed a similar nectin-1 binding mode as observed for HSV gD. Nevertheless, several unique features at the PRV-gD/nectin-1 binding interface (e. g. a bulged \u03b12' helix of PRV gD interacts with an adjusted CC\u2019 loop in nectin-1, an about 3.5-\u00c5 shift for PRV gD (relative to HSV gD) when bound to the receptor) suffice the PRV ligand to recognize nectin-1 using quite different gD residues from those of the HSV homologs. These structural observations therefore provide a systematic view on the receptor binding mechanism of a second alphaherpesvirus and yet the first in the Varicellovirus genus.",

We noted that it has been a long time (over four months) before the proteins (gD337 for the free structure and gD284 for the complex structure) were successfully crystallized. Taking into account that large disordered parts of a protein are likely perturbing crystal formation, it may indicate a possible proteolysis of both the gD337 and the gD284 C-terminal regions during crystallization, leading to similar proportion of the gD residues (P7-P250 in the free gD structure and P9-D241 in the complex structure) being successfully traced in the free gD and the nectin-1 bound structures. We therefore believe that the re-orientation of the gD N-loop before and after nectin-1 binding is more likely the result of receptor engagement than arising from the differences in the gD forms used for crystallization. A flexible N-loop which experiences rearrangement or is structurally stabilized upon receptor binding has also been observed for HSV gDs [22, 26].",

Along the sheet, a total of 20 residues (out of 31 for PRV gD, 22 for HSV-1 gD and 26 for HSV-2 gD) were recognized by all the three viral ligands (summarized in Table 2). It is notable that these amino acids contribute the majority of the inter-molecule interactions and therefore constitute a conserved central contact interface dominating gD-binding, whereas the remaining nectin-1 residues provided additional and supplementary contacts for engagement of gD. It is interesting that the PRV and HSV gDs, with only 22% sequence identity, select essentially the same contact interface in nectin-1 for recognition and engagement. We believe this interface patch likely has evolved as a major ligand-binding entity, dominating the nectin-1 interaction not only with PRV and HSV, but also with other alphaherpesviruses (e. g. BHV-1). It is also noteworthy that it is not rare phenomena that different viruses could recognize the same host surface molecule as the cellular receptor. It would therefore be interesting to investigate if other viruses similarly recognize extensively overlapped surface patches during receptor engagement, as observed for the PRV/HSV pair. To our knowledge, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the related bat-derived HKU4 coronavirus represent another example of such case. Both viruses recognize human CD26 via the viral spike protein, and they were shown to bind to the same propeller elements of the receptor [32, 33].",

It should be noted that the affinity of PRV gD for HU-nectin-1 is determined to be 191 nM, which is about 100 fold higher than that calculated for nectin-1 self-interactions [23].

According to a previously reported dimeric structure of HSV gD, the viral ligand prelocates its PFD in a position that will preclude the binding of gD with its receptors [25]. The gD/receptor engagement therefore would only occur when this prelocated loop is displaced, exposing the otherwise locked receptor binding site. Consistent with this structural observation, a short HSV gD protein lacking PFD is about 100-fold more competent than the long gD form in terms of receptor binding [20, 25]. In the current study, we demonstrated that the affinity of PRV gD284 (a short gD variant without the membrane-proximal loop) for nectin-1 is also dramatically (~12\u201316 folds) higher than that of gD337 (a long gD form containing the whole ectodomain). We believe this phenomenon echoes what has been observed with HSV-gD PFD, indicating a role of the PRV-gD membrane-proximal loop in membrane fusion. It is also noteworthy that the enhanced receptor binding affinity for the short variant of HSV gD stems mainly from a significantly increased binding on-rate (~ 40 fold in Kon), falling in a good accordance with the prelocation of PFD in gD [25]. In contrast, the changes in Kon between PRV gD284 and gD337 is only about 5\u20138 folds. This argues against a prelocation of the membrane-proximal loop in PRV gD and may indicate a novel mechanism of the loop interfering with nectin-1 binding. These are interesting issues that are worth of studying in the future.",

It is notable that the HVEM binding site in HSV gD is allocated to an N-terminal hairpin which was re-constituted by the long protein N-loop upon HVEM engagement. An N-loop of sufficient size is therefore a prerequisite for the gD ligand to interact with HVEM [27]. Facilitated by the structure-based sequence alignment between PRV and HSV gDs, it is clear that the N-loop of the PRV protein is only about half size of that in HSV gD. We believe this dramatically shortened N-loop in the PRV ligand can not support HVEM-binding, representing the structural basis of its inertness in HVEM recognition.",

(C) Comparison of the PRV-gD/SW-nectin-1 (PRV gD in green and SW-nectin-1 is cyan) complex structure with previously reported HSV-1-gD/HU-nectin-1 (HSV-1 gD in yellow and HU-nectin-1 in orange) and HSV-2-gD/HU-nectin-1 (HSV-2 gD in magenta and HU-nectin-1 in gray) complex structures. The CC' loop of variant conformations in nectin-1, the 3.5 \u00c5 shift between the bound PRV and HSV gDs, and the unique \u03b12' helix in PRV gD bulged towards the CC' loop of nectin-1 are highlighted and labeled. For clarity, the view of the structure in panel (C) is clockwise rotated along the vertical axis for about 90 degrees relative to that in panel (B).",
