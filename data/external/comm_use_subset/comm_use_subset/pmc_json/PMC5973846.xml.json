            "text": "Tonsil surgery has been performed for more than 3,000 years [1, 2]. Historically, tonsillectomy was mainly performed to treat the infectious complications of tonsillitis [2, 3]. With the introduction of oral antibiotics in the 1960s, the number of tonsillectomies declined; however, it is still one of the most common surgical procedures performed in Western countries [3\u20137]. Adenoidectomy is a regular surgical procedure performed by otolaryngologists. Occasionally, an adenoidectomy is performed concurrently with tonsillectomy. An adenoidectomy performed alone or with other procedures such as tympanostomy tube placement, or nasal surgery may exhibit different characteristics. The variation in adenotonsillectomy (AT) rates across different countries may be explained in part by the different cultural attitudes toward the protective role of these lymphoepithelial structures [8, 9], use of antibiotics for throat infections, and absence of generally accepted indication criteria for surgery [10, 11]. A 22-year nationwide cohort showed a significant decrease in the incidence of tonsillectomy over time [12]; however, regional variations were observed in the number of tonsillectomies. Following the introduction of a national clinical guideline for the management of sore throat and indications for tonsillectomy, Mcleod et al. reported a probable association between an increase in admissions with tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess and a decrease in the rate of tonsillectomy [13]. In contrast to the abundance of information on the incidence trends of AT in Western countries [3\u20135, 14, 15], limited data exist for Eastern countries [16].",

When the most stringent criteria for AT were applied, a randomized clinical trial [17] showed that surgery was modestly beneficial. However, the same study also provided support for nonsurgical management because during the 3-year follow-up period, many participants in the nonsurgical groups had fewer than three episodes of throat infection, most of which were mild. By contrast, when less frequent or milder illness led to AT, little to no benefit was found [18]. Another study revealed a low level of consensus among pediatricians and otolaryngologists on the appropriateness of AT [11]. Evidence-based guidelines regarding repeated throat infections as an indication for AT are still lacking, which leaves this procedure in the category of \u201cpreference-sensitive care\u201d [19]. Differences in clinical practice remain an obvious but inadequately documented problem [20].",

Although the number (blue line) and percentage (blue bar) of RICI declined from 85 (83.3%) in 1997 to 69 (57.0%) in 2010, RICI remained the most prevalent indication for AT, followed by UAO and Tumor. For UAO, both the total number (green line) and percentage (green bar) of patients showed a surge between 2001 and 2006. A significant decrease in the UAO category from 85 (46.0%) in 2006 to 29 (24.0%) in 2010 was demonstrated. Nonetheless, the incidence of UAO showed an increasing trend. The total number of patients and the percentage of Tumor were relatively small from 1997 to 2006, with exceptions in 2003 and 2004, when a transient increase in the incidence and percentage was noted, coincided with a sharp decline in RICI and a modest decrease in UAO. During 2006\u20132010, the rate and proportion of Tumor increased markedly from 6 (3.2%) in 2006 to 23 (19.0%) in 2010, coincided with the rapid decrease in UAO. Further inspection of the data of these patients revealed that the three leading diagnoses were ICD-9-CM 146 (malignant neoplasm of oropharynx), 196 (secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes of head, face, and neck), and 210 (benign neoplasm of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx) at 32%, 18.0%, and 11.7%, respectively. The overall incidence of the Tumor category demonstrated a noticeable increasing trend.

However, longitudinal data confirmed an increasing trend in the pediatric AT rates from 1997 to 2010. Regarding surgical indications for AT, although we reported a declining trend of infectious indications, treatment of RICI remained the most common cause of AT regardless of the calendar year, sex, age groups, hospital level, or insured residence areas. In the adult subgroup, we identified a decreasing prevalence of infectious indications, coincided with an increasing neoplastic indications.

During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, elective surgeries were either canceled or postponed, and the AT rate dropped significantly in 2002 and 2003. After the SARS epidemic, the incidence of AT increased up to 185 cases in 2006. Major public health events such as SARS may affect the surgical rate, particularly for elective surgical procedures. However, the surgical rate declined again after 2006, with most of the reduction observed in adult UAO patients. Since 2000, an increasing amount of evidence has shown that solitary tonsillectomy as a treatment for adult SDB patients might have a limited effect, even if they present with grade IV (kissing) tonsils. Otolaryngologists usually recommend adult SDB patients to receive uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), instead of solitary tonsillectomy, in those who do not tolerate to or are unwilling to use continuous positive airway pressure devices or other conservative treatment such as oral appliances [28]. In contrast, UAO has become a plausible indication for AT, especially in pediatric patients [3]. Because adenotonsillar hypertrophy is a major cause of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children, AT is among the first-line therapies recommended for uncomplicated pediatric OSA [29, 30].",

Although AT for a suspected or confirmed neoplasm is rarely performed in children, it is the third most prevalent indication for AT in adults [6]. The NHI has encouraged almost all patients with AT to undergo surgery on an inpatient basis. By contrast, ambulatory AT procedures in children have nearly doubled over the past decade in the United States, with only <3% of tonsillectomies performed in an inpatient setting [22]. In Taiwan, the inconvenience of admission may partly reduce the surgical rate in the pediatric population. One study found that even when physicians recommended a surgical procedure based on the current guidelines, parents often chose nonsurgical treatment options because of anecdotal reports or based on their own education or social experiences [26]. The percentage of surgical procedures in the <18 years subgroup (48.2%) is relatively small compared with the figures that have been reported by other studies [5, 16, 21, 31], reflecting parental concerns regarding AT in Taiwan.",

Parker and Walner [3] demonstrated a shift in surgical indications for pediatric AT from infection toward obstruction. In the group aged <18 years, more than 85% underwent surgery due to a UAO. Koshy et al. [4] reported that incidence of OSA diagnosis among children aged < 4 years who underwent AT doubled between 2001 and 2011. Clement [32] presented an increase in the rate of ambulatory AT in children with conditions on the SDB spectrum from 26% in 2001 to 55% in 2011, whereas UAO became the most common indication for AT among preschool children. Our results confirmed an increasing trend toward surgical management for upper airway obstructive symptoms rather than for mainly infectious reasons. However, treatment of RICI remained the most common indication for AT across all age groups. Those results reveal a lack of awareness among pediatricians and otolaryngologists of the symptoms of SDB and the difficulty in diagnosing OSA in the pediatric population.",

Compared with deep tonsil biopsies, tonsillectomies have a significantly higher probability of detecting occult tonsillar tumors [34]. In this study, the surgical indications for tonsillar neoplasm increased substantially from 1997 to 2010, especially after 2006. A possible reason for this trend was the Taiwanese government's implementation of free oral and pharyngeal mucosal screening among high-risk groups (those who aged 18 or above and have a history of smoking or betel nut chewing) from 2007. By the end of this National Cancer Prevention and Control project, 1440,000 high-risk candidates (aged 18 or above, with a history of smoking or betel nut chewing) had been screened. The screening rate was 28%. One thousand two hundred and forty-eight patients were diagnosed to have oral or oropharyngeal cancer during 2008\u20132009. The timing of this national policy correlated well with the increase in tumor tonsillectomy. Furthermore, increasing incidence rates of oropharyngeal cancers were discovered on a global scale [35].",

This trend is also plausible because the diagnosis of SDB may require overnight polysomnography and sleep laboratory testing may not be available in local hospitals. Additionally, patients diagnosed with neoplasms preferred regional hospitals or medical centers to local hospitals. In the analysis of the surgical indications by insured residence area, we found higher-than-expected (based on the population in each division) numbers of ATs performed in the Taipei and Central districts. The surgical rate of AT in Taiwan seemed to be higher in the metropolitan areas than in rural areas. The abundance of medical resources in these metropolitan areas may be a contributing factor. However, insured residence area was not an independent factor associated with the distribution of the surgical indications for AT after adjustment for confounders.",

Second, because the inherent preference of coding could not be assessed from our results; the accuracy of the type of procedures performed and the surgical indications may have been affected. Third, this study included a homogeneous population of Chinese patients in Taiwan; the generalizability of our results to other ethnic populations may be limited. Finally, selection bias may still exist when using LHID2005 for trend analysis. Those patients who received surgery after 1997 but died before 2005 were not included in the LHID2005. The study population who became older after 2005 might have a higher risk of developing neoplasms. Moreover, the number of surgery in the pediatric population less than five years of age was underestimated between 2005 and 2010. All these biases were potential confounders in this study. Therefore, we also examined the LHID2000 and LHID2010, which concurred with our current finding, to substantiate our observed trends in LHID2001. However, a complete dataset from the entire population with an extended study period would allow for more accurate trend analysis and prediction.",

Incidence of pediatric AT increased with a shift in surgical indications from infections to obstruction. In the adult, the proportion of AT performed for infections decreased, whereas those performed due to neoplasm increased significantly. The age in the adult subgroup and hospital level in the pediatric group were significant factors associated with the changing surgical indications for AT.
