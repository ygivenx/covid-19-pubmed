There is no single laboratory test that can serve as a potential biomarker to identify the patients at high risk for a complicated clinical course. Shortly after the pandemic reached our catchment area, we noted that some of the patients who needed to be hospitalized for severe H1N1 infection had high serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which are usually seen in systemic bacterial infections and not in viral respiratory diseases [3-6]. High serum CRP levels were found in patients affected by Corona virus during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 [7,8], when they were also identified as predictors of respiratory failure and death [7-9].",

The setting for this investigation was a single tertiary care university-affiliated medical center. The Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center serves a population of 1 million citizens in the Tel Aviv municipal area. All of the patients were 18 years of age or older. Data were collected for all consecutive patients admitted to the ED between May 1 and December 31, 2009, who fulfilled the clinical criteria for confirmed H1N1 influenza infection as established by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These criteria included flu-like symptoms, such as a body temperature of 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) or higher, cough or sore throat, and a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) positive for H1N1 virus [10]. All patients whose serum CRP levels were measured within 24 hours of presentation to the ED were eligible for inclusion, whether they were subsequently hospitalized or discharged after initial evaluation. Following a review of patients' charts and records for symptoms and signs, laboratory and imaging findings, and blood and urine cultures (when available), patients with a proven additional concurrent acute illness (e.g., bacteremia) were excluded from the study.",

The following times were also noted: from the first symptom to admission, from admission to ICU, provision of mechanical ventilation, and death. Radiologists unaware of patients' clinical data and outcome reviewed all chest radiographs obtained within 24 hours of admission to the ED, for findings characteristic of H1N1 pneumonia in adults, according to recently published descriptions [11,12]. The main outcome measures were whether or not the patient was admitted to the ICU, if mechanical ventilation was required and death. Follow-up of all the enrolled patients was managed via a telephone survey conducted at least 30 days since hospital admission. The query items focused on the appearance of any additional symptoms, the administration of any additional medical treatment, re-hospitalization, and outcome.",

The comparison of continuous variables between groups was by independent samples Student's t-test for normally distributed variables and by the Mann-Whitney U statistics for non-normally distributed variables. Frequencies of categorical variables were compared by the Fisher exact test. In order to assess CRP as an early predictor of outcome, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve was calculated to determine the predictive ability of different CRP serum level cutoff values for the different outcomes [13]. Primary outcomes of required transfer to ICU and mechanical ventilation were evaluated on a time-to-event basis by Kaplan-Meier analysis with the use of the log-rank statistics to test for determining differences in the rates of the end points according to serum CRP levels. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used, applying the forward stepwise analysis method to assess the effects of potential outcome markers. The SPSS statistical package was used to perform all the statistical evaluations (SSPS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For all analyses, a value of p < .05 (two-tailed) was considered to indicate statistical significance.",

The fact that patients with low serum CRP levels enjoyed good outcome may serve as a guiding tool, enabling the assessing clinician in the ED to differentiate between \"low risk\" patients vs. \"high risk\" patients. As evident from Table 2, a cut-off value of 33 mg/L is a viable choice that achieves 100% sensitivity but a specificity of only around 40% for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. By comparison, a slightly higher CRP cut-off of 64 mg/L achieved lower but acceptable sensitivities of 82% and 75% for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, respectively, with higher specificities of 68% and 65%, respectively. Thus, it appears that serum CRP levels may have a significant role in helping the physician in the decision making process on the individual patient level.",

Two series of studies of lung specimens taken from autopsies of patients who died in the recent pandemic reported that many of the victims had a proven secondary bacterial infection. Gill et al. [14] found histologic and microbiologic evidence of bacterial pneumonia in 55% of 34 people who died following a confirmed pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus infection. Similar findings were found in 29% of lung specimens from 77 fatal cases in another series [15]. Thus, it is plausible that the high CRP levels among some of the patients in the current study may represent a secondary bacterial infection. Another possible explanation is that the high serum CRP levels represent a severe inflammatory response to the H1N1 virus. A similar hypothesis was suggested with regards to SARS, which was caused by the Corona virus in the 2002 outbreak. It was postulated that exaggerated activation of cytokines/chemokines played an significant role in the pathogenesis of the disease leading to an adverse outcome [16,17]. Either one of the aforementioned explanations is compatible with the current findings, which indicate that CRP levels may serve as a useful biomarker for predicting disease severity among patients with suspected or confirmed H1N1 influenza A virus infection.",

The absence of an agreed protocol for the measurement of serum CRP in patients with H1N1 virus infection admitted to the ED led to the exclusion of 34% of the 315 patients from the study cohort and may have also biased the results. Thus, it may make it difficult to extrapolate the results to another population. Despite these limitations, the association between CRP levels upon presentation to the ED and patient outcome was significant and substantial. Another potential limitation is the need for ICU care as a measurement of outcome severity, since the decision itself might have been based on, among other factors, admission serum CRP levels. Only one patient in this series was admitted to the ICU directly from the ED.",
