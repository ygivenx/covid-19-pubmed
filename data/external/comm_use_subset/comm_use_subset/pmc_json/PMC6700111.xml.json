A conventional PV neutralization test (cPNT) using cell culture and infectious PV strains, which are usually attenuated vaccine strains, is currently performed to measure the anti-PV neutralization antibody4. Serosurveillance in Japan has been performed in prefectural laboratories every 2 to 3 years since 1974 (for about 1,100 to 1,800 individuals in 6 to 8 prefectures) in a wide age range (age of 0 to >40 year) to monitor vulnerability5. Serosurveillance is also important in Japan after the introduction of Sabin strain-based IPV (sIPV) after 20126. sIPV induces similar persistence of anti-PV antibody to conventional wild-type-stain-based IPV when used as a booster in adults with history of OPV administration7. Recent reports suggest rapid declines of the antibody titre after sIPV administration8\u201310. The persistence of anti-PV antibody in children vaccinated with sIPV without OPV remains is poorly understood.",

The capsid protein type is critical for type 1 PV, exemplified by significant antigenic differences between the type 1 Sabin strain and the parental Mahoney strain by the VP3-T60K mutation24,25, and by an emergence of the type 1 wild-type strain with significantly low antigenicity26. Absolute titre or infectious units of PVpv could be determined using focus assay12. The luciferase signal of PVpv-infected cells might be useful to determine the relative titre22. In cPNT, neutralization titre is determined by an endpoint reading for the cytopathic effect on infected cells, so it is an all-or-none reading. In pPNT, neutralization titre is determined by reading the PVpv infection, which represents a percentage of luciferase signal in the infected cells, which is not an all-or-none reading. Therefore, threshold values are required for pPNT to define apparent \u201cneutralization\u201d of PVpv. Threshold values of PVpv infection have been inductively estimated to give the best fit to cPNT results (2.5% to 25% of PVpv infection)21,22. Variation of reported threshold values might suggest robustness of pPNT. Seropositive rates determined at a wide range of threshold values were substantially unaffected (e.g., seropositive rates for type 2 were 92% to 95% determined in a range of threshold values of 2.5% to 10%)21. The rationale to determine the threshold values remains to be provided.",

            "text": "Previously, we performed pPNT with PVpv(WT) for 131 human serum samples21. We determined the threshold values by maximizing the fitness of the seropositive rates (population with neutralization titre of at least 8). However, we could not directly compare the results because cPNT was performed with Sabin strains. To analyse the direct correlation between cPNT and pPNT, we analysed the distribution of PVpv infection (%) in the presence of human serum diluted to the cPNT titre (Fig. 2). The PVpv(Sabin) infection showed a sharp peak around 0%, with medians of 2.0%, 2.1%, and 4.6%, for type 1, 2, and 3 PVpv(Sabin), respectively. The percentages of the serum samples that showed less than 5% PVpv infection at the cPNT titre were 71%, 71%, and 54% for type 1, 2, and 3 PVpv(Sabin), respectively. The percentages of the serum samples that showed less than 10% PVpv infection at the cPNT titre were 88%, 84%, and 72% for type 1, 2, and 3 PVpv(Sabin), respectively. A broader peak width for type 3 than types 1 and 2 might reflect intrinsic weak antigenicity of type 3 PV in humans vaccinated with OPV (Fig. 3). The profile of the curves of type 2 and 3 PVpv(WT) were like type 2 and 3 PVpv(Sabin)21. In contrast, the curve for PV1pv(WT) was significantly different from PV1pv(Sabin), and it showed a broad peak width (median of 15%). These results indicated substantial suppression of PVpv infection in the presence of human serum diluted to the cPNT titre and significant antigenic differences for type 1 PVpv.",

            "text": "Next, threshold values for PVpv(Sabin) were analysed using the seropositive rate and the degree of correlation to compare to cPNT (Fig. 3A). For type 1 and 2 PVpv(Sabin), the seropositive rates were almost equal at a range of examined threshold values (5% to 15% of threshold values) and within 10% of variation from cPNT. PV3pv(Sabin) showed relatively low seropositive rate (61%) with a threshold value of 5% (Fig. 2). The highest degree of correlation between cPNT and pPNT in terms of residual sum of square was observed for threshold values of 5%. This suggested that threshold values of 5% might be optimal for pPNT with type 1 and 2 PVpv(Sabin). For PV3pv(Sabin), a threshold value of 10% seemed to give an optimal correlation. This suggests that the levels of PVpv infection, under which about 70% of the distribution was included around the peak, serves as the optimal threshold for pPNT (Fig. 2). With threshold values of 5% for type 1 and 2 PVpv(Sabin) and 10% for PV3pv(Sabin), pPNT with PVpv(Sabin) showed high correlation with cPNT (R2 of 0.92, 0.83, and 0.79, respectively). For type 2 and 3, the results of PVpv(Sabin) were like PVpv(WT) (R2 of 0.81 and 0.77, respectively). For type 1, the correlation degree was drastically improved with PVpv(Sabin) compared to PVpv(WT) (R2 of 0.92 vs. 0.59), and the correlation between cPNT and pPNT was consistently observed among different age groups with PVpv(Sabin) in contrast to PVpv(WT) (Fig. 3B)21. For type 2 and 3 PVpv(Sabin), the correlation was also observed among the age groups, as previously observed for PVpv(WT)21. One of the critical points in PV serosurveillance is in the estimation of seropositive rate. Accurate determination of overall and age-specific seropositive rates by pPNT supports the potential of pPNT as an alternative to cPNT along with the observed high correlation.",

In 19/20 of the experiments, the pPNT titres of standard sera were determined as 64 or 128 (Fig. 4A). We also analysed lot-to-lot differences of PVpv(Sabin) with the standard monkey anti-PV sera (Fig. 4B). Two different lots of PVpv(Sabin) showed similar neutralization curves with the antisera. Next, we tested the reproducibility with a set of human sera (total 131 samples) in three independent experiments (Fig. 5, Supplementary Data 1). We found consistent seropositive rates and distribution of neutralization titre among the experiments. These results suggest high reproducibility of pPNT and robustness of established conditions.",

A 2-fold dilution series was made, resulting in 1/4 to 1/1024 dilutions. 5 \u03bcL of diluted sera or DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS (mock treatment) was added to three 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, 781080). Next, 5 \u03bcL of type 1, 2, or 3 PVpv solution (400 IU) was added to each well of the plates (one plate for each serotype of PVpv for a total of 3 plates). The plates were centrifuged (700 \u00d7 g, 10 sec) (PlateSpin, KUBOTA). After centrifugation, plates were incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After incubation, 20 \u03bcL of RD cell suspension in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS (5.0 \u00d7 103 cells) was added to each well of the plates. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 7 h. Luciferase signal of the infected cells was measured at 7 h p.i. with Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) using a 2030 ARVO X luminometer (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PVpv infection was calculated as a percentage of luciferase signal of the infected cells. The luciferase signal in mock-treated cells was taken as 100%. Neutralizing antibody titre was determined as a reciprocal number of the highest dilution of the serum that suppressed PVpv infection to less than 5%.",
