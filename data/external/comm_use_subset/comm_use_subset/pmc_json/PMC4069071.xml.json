All the participating GPs received swabs and other study materials and were asked to enroll the first two patients of any age consulting a Sentinelles GP for an ILI in each week. The Sentinelles network case definition used for the inclusion of ILI patients was a sudden fever of 39\u00b0C or above, and respiratory symptoms and myalgia [13] less than 48 hours after the onset of the symptoms. Sample collection from patients with ILI was performed with \u03a3-Virocult\u00ae swabs (ELITech, France). The nasopharyngeal swabs were sent by mail to the virological laboratory in 1 mL of viral transport medium and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Patient information, including demographic characteristics, symptoms, risk factors for severe influenza, treatment, vaccination status, and hospitalization, was documented in case report forms. All samples were tested for influenza viruses A (A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm2009) and B by influenza real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) (Table 1) [9]\u2013[14]. Samples were also tested for the simultaneous detection of 26 types/subtypes of respiratory viral pathogens using a Magicplex\u2122 RV Panel Real-Time Test (Seegene) and as listed in Table 1. Human rhinovirus (HRV) A/B/C, human respiratory syncytial virus A/B, and human metapneumovirus results were confirmed by a supplementary real-time RT\u2013PCR [15]\u2013[16].",

In Corsica, this emergency general practice surveillance system was implemented in December 2010. It is based on the activity of 11 GPs covering a population of 100 000 habitants (the Ajaccio area in the southwest of Corsica; see Figure 1) and responding to private house calls 24 h a day, 7 days a week [8]. The GPs report on a daily basis the sociodemographic and medical data for each patient visited (age, sex, diagnosis and hospitalization) [20]. For maximal comparability with respect to the definition of the French Sentinelles network for the inclusion of ILI patients, the SOS M\u00e9decins ILI definition (sudden fever of 38.5\u00b0C or above, respiratory symptoms and myalgia) is coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (code \u201cR80 Influenza/R80 ILI) [20]. The weekly number of visits coded as \u201cR80 Influenza/R80 ILI\u201d by SOS M\u00e9decins, was analyzed.

It should be noted that while human respiratory syncytial virus (A/B), was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus after influenza in patients aged less than 15 years, in agreement with previous studies [31], HRV was the most frequently detected virus in patients aged >65 years. Information about the non influenza viral infections such as HRV to ILI episodes in older persons is poor, partly because of difficulties in diagnosis related to atypical presentations and low viral loads [32]\u2013[34]. Previously, it has been suggested that HRV could be the cause of exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases and could increase morbidity rates in frail persons as, including the elderly [33]\u2013[34]. Overall, the RIR of consulting for an ILI was similar among the different surveillance networks analyzed here and decreased significantly with age. Two age groups were characterized by an RIR above 1: preschool and school-aged children less than 14 years old, and working adults aged 30\u201344 years. This peak in the 30\u201344-year-old group could be explained by their proximity to children as parents. This trend is in accordance with the viral etiology of the epidemic, characterized by the cocirculation of A(H1N1)pdm2009 and B influenza viruses [35].",

This was remarkable because of the significant cocirculation of influenza A and B viruses and of other respiratory viruses. This finding is likely attributable to the high VC against influenza viruses among residents, similar to the VC previously reported in French nursing homes [36], and a certain degree of cross-protection from previous exposure to influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009 [37]. It could also be due to the result of better general hygiene management, as demonstrated by the rarity of clusters of gastroenteritis (N = 3) declared by the same sentinel nursing homes. However, it is unlikely to have arisen through a good VC among staff, as this was low (16%), similar to staff VC levels previously reported that ranged from 10% to 50% [36].",

Except for one strain that belonged to the group 3, all other Influenza B strains fell into genetic group 2 and were characterized by five mutations compared with the vaccine strain, located at four antigenic sites, which could suggest a drift [42]. The A(H1N1)pdm2009 viruses detected in Corsica belonged to groups 6 and 7, and showed a good match with the vaccine strain [43]. As previously reported, the HA sequences of A(H3N2) viruses isolated in Corsica during the 2012\u20132013 season [10] were characterized by seven amino acid substitutions at four antigenic sites compared with A/Victoria/361/2011 (2012\u20132013 vaccine strain), suggesting a drift [42].",

The monitoring of ILI, is mainly based on clinical surveillance, as the virological surveillance, for instance, was carried out by the Sentinelles network. The lack of virological confirmation for the patients of the emergency general practice network (SOS M\u00e9decins), who visited the hospital emergency departments (OSCOUR) and/or in nursing homes is an important gap. The evaluation of the causative agents of ILI in patients enrolled by the GPs of the Sentinelles network did not cover all possible respiratory pathogens, as other bacterial or viral pathogens that can cause ILI were not investigated. It is possible that a low viral titer could not be detected by RT-\u2013PCR. Moreover, antigenic characterization of the influenza viruses that were characterized genetically was not performed. Overall, the patients were enrolled using a rather specific ILI case definition (especially for the Sentinelles network and for the SOS M\u00e9decins network), excluding infected patients with atypical ILI symptom presentations, including older persons, as well as asymptomatic infections. Finally, the epidemic threshold was only available for the ILI consultation rates reported by the Sentinelles GPs at a national level, which may not be adequate at a regional level with respect to the GPs Sentinelles network and with respect to the other local surveillance systems.",
