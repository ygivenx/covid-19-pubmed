            "text": "The intermediate filament protein vimentin exert important intracellular functions, regulating processes like cell migration and sustaining cell integrity. The importance of vimentin-mediated processes was underestimated for years, mainly because vimentin deficient (vim\n\u2212/\u2212) mice initially were described as displaying virtually normal phenotypes and no apparent physiological defects were observed1. Eventually, more detailed studies on vim\n\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed that vimentin has key functions in events of cell signalling, migration and adhesion2, 3. The 57 kDa type III intermediate filament protein, consists of a head-, rod- and tail domain and can be post-translationally modified. A large number of phosphorylation sites have been characterised, especially on the head domain where the phosphorylation status regulate filament assembly4, 5. Deamination of arginine residues in the head domain leads to citrullination, which may be important in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis6. Vimentin may be further modified by addition of N-Acetylglucosamine or act as a specific target for glycation7\u20139. In addition, proteolytic cleavage by specific caspases and calpain further modify vimentin10, 11. Apart from the influence of post-translational modification on filament assembly, the functional effects of modification still remain largely unknown. Possibly due to the high intracellular abundance of vimentin, the extracellular localisation and possible functions has only been described in the last 15 years. Initially, vimentin was found on the surface of activated macrophages, but more recently it has been found on the surface of more cells including circulating tumour cells12\u201314. How the vimentin-mediated processes are regulated remains elusive, and it seems that vimentin is a highly dynamic molecule with tissue specific functions15\u201317. Vimentin has been shown to take part in viral and bacterial infections and may be a key partner in neuronal regeneration18\u201321. It has been suggested that vimentin may serve as a potential anti-angiogenic target, however, results are contradicting22\u201324. As angiogenesis is an essential part of sustaining oxygen supply in health as well as in disease, potential anti-angiogenic targets have to be carefully evaluated to avoid severe adverse effects by the anti-angiogenic treatment13. The ability to form new blood vessels is diminished with age. To increase our cellular and biochemical understanding of this age related decline in angiogenesis, we have previously established long-term in cultivation of endothelial cells25. We established that the ability of the endothelial cells to form tube like structures when grown on matrigel decline when allowed to age in culture25. To identify change of endothelial cell expression profile that correlates with the loss of ability to form tubes, we applied the phage antibody technology as a discovery tool. The Tomlinson I+J library was applied to select single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against proteins of ageing HUVEC cells by the phage display technology26, 27. One of these antibodies, named LOB7, displays pro-angiogenic features in 2D matrigel assays. We have identified vimentin as the protein target for this antibody. The blockage of functional epitopes combined with detailed mechanistic studies most likely will pave the way for increased understanding of extracellular vimentin and possibly provide new leads to treat human disease.",

Vimentin was identified as the top hit from the mass spectrometry analysis (Supplementary Tabel S1). Some of the residual sample of precipitated proteins was analysed by western blot using the mouse monoclonal anti vimentin antibody V9 (Fig. 1a). This confirmed the presence of vimentin in the sample of proteins precipitated from HUVEC lysates by the use of LOB7. Accordingly, phage antibody ELISA was performed on serial diluted recombinant vimentin. A clear signal was observed (Fig. 1b).

Although not significant the effect could still be observed after 10 hours with an enhanced tubed formation of 23%, whereas the effect was absent after 20 hours. To examine whether LOB7 has an impact on migration, a scratch assay was performed. An effect on migration was not observed (Supplementary Fig. S4). Also, the influence on proliferation upon addition of the LOB7 antibody was examined, again without observing any significant enhancement of proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4).",

            "text": "In this study, we describe a phage display scFv antibody selected against human endothelial cells grown in long-term culture. Mass spectrometry identified vimentin as the antigen of the LOB7 antibody. Increased expression of vimentin has previously been shown in ageing human cells in long-term culture31. Vimentin could be detected in the sample of precipitated proteins using a mouse anti-vimentin antibody (V9) in western blotting. These results were supported by ELISA tests of LOB7 against recombinant vimentin, and recombinant fragments of vimentin. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by western blot analysis in which V9 and LOB7 were used for detection of vimentin in cell lysate and growth factor reduced matrigel. The antibodies revealed bands sharing the same apparent size. A discrepancy in apparent size of vimentin in matrigel compared to HUVEC lysate was observed (Fig. 1c). It is known that vimentin can differ in size depending on location17 and that caspase activity during apoptosis cleaves vimentin into sizes similar to those observed here32. The angiogenic effect of targeting vimentin remains unclear. Previously a vimentin specific phage display peptide was shown to promote the tube formation in 2-D matrigel assays by a 2-fold increase24. Even small amounts of this peptide induced the formation of tubes, however, the effect was only observed under hypoxic conditions. In contrast a study performed by Beijnum et al.22, not relying on 2-D matrigel assays, showed decreased tube formation by targeting vimentin in 3-D collagen assays, in vivo Chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, and in mice models by means of different anti vimentin antibodies22. In this study, we have presented an antibody that promotes tube formation under normoxic conditions in a 2-D matrigel assay. The mechanisms mediating the enhanced tube formation were not clarified. However, it was established that the LOB7 antibody does not have a direct influence on migration or proliferation of cultured endothelial cells. It can be hypothesised that the binding site of LOB7 stabilises the focal adhesion points between the cell surface and extracellular matrix. A process in which vimentin has key function14. We furthermore show that LOB7 recognises the coil 2 fragment of vimentin. It is of high functional relevance to gain more detailed insight to the epitope of LOB7. Furthermore, future experiments using in vivo models are imperative in order to understand and verify the effect of LOB7.",

All constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (Stratagene) and expressed in small scale. In brief, 50 mL cultures were inoculated 1:100 in Terrific Broth media holding 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin and grown until OD600 0.5 where the expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG (Sigma Aldrich). The expression was performed overnight at 30 \u00b0C and 200 RPM. The cells were then spun down at 5000 g for 30 minutes at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatants were discarded. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 holding 8 M urea, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 1 mM DTT. Next, lysis was conducted with a SONOPLUS ultrasonic homogenizer (Bandelin) with settings 50% pulses of 20 kHz and 28 W. The cells were sonicated in 3 \u00d7 3 minutes including 3 minutes on ice between each round. Finally, lysed cells were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C and 15.000 g for 30 minutes. The fragments were detected in the supernatants by western blot, conducted as described above.",
