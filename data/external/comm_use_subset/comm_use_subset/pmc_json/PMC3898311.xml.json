Respiratory disease is the leading cause of death in weaned dairy heifers and the second most common cause of mortality in pre-weaned calves in cattle herds in the United States. It is estimated that BRD is responsible for the loss of more than one million animals and approximately US $700 million annually (USDA, 2007; Wittum et al., 1996). Effective control of BRD has proven difficult in the North American dairy industry, at least in part due to the complexity of disease pathogenesis and the ubiquity of BRD-associated pathogens (Gorden & Plummer, 2010).",

When infected by primary respiratory pathogens, such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) (Brodersen, 2010), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Ridpath, 2010), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (Jones & Chowdhury, 2010), or Parainfluenza 3 (PI3) virus (Ellis, 2010), the host\u2019s respiratory defenses may become impaired (Ames, 2002; Caswell & Williams, 2007). Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica (Griffin et al., 2010), and Mycoplasma bovis (Caswell et al., 2010), may be naturally present in small numbers in the nasal passages of healthy cattle but can be opportunistically pathogenic when the host\u2019s defenses become impaired. Other factors including nutritional status, stress, and air quality may also play roles in impairing host defense mechanisms (Ackermann, Derscheid & Roth, 2010; Gorden & Plummer, 2010).",

Infections of the upper respiratory tract such as rhinitis typically present with ocular and nasal discharge. Infections of the lower tract, in contrast, may be challenging to detect earlier in the disease course. In addition, both upper and lower tract infections may vary in severity. Despite the variability of presentation, the observation of clinical signs is the most common method used to identify cattle in need of treatment for BRD. However, the specific criteria used to detect BRD are subjective and vary widely among dairies and observers, leading to deleterious effects on animal welfare and unnecessary treatments with antimicrobial drugs (Kelly & Janzen, 1986; Radostits & Done, 2007). Identification of etiologic agents associated with specific cases of BRD based on clinical observation alone is not typically possible.",

Molecular and biochemical diagnostic tests, such as PCR and culture on selective media, respectively, are available for ante mortem diagnosis of BRD, but are prohibitively expensive and cannot provide results at the point of treatment (Cooper & Brodersen, 2010).

(1977) is ill-suited for field work because it uses 17 predictors, hematologic data, and requires observations specific to the pre-inoculation described in their study. The DART system does not appear in peer-reviewed literature and is difficult to standardize between locations because the clinical sign weights and decision points are not defined. The WI score is the most suitable of the three cited scores with published score weights and a decision rule. However, the WI score subdivides each of its clinical signs into 4 levels, which may have ambiguous overlap to inexperienced individuals making it difficult to appropriately classify clinical signs in calves. Until recently, information regarding these systems\u2019 diagnostic performance in the field have not been published. A single published study has estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the WI scoring system as 55.4% and 58.0%, respectively (Buczinski et al., 2013). There is also no evidence that any of these BRD scores used quantitative methods to assign weights to clinical signs.",

Levels of clinical predictors that converged poorly due to sparse sample size within strata were also collapsed into adjacent strata to improve convergence. Other clinical signs were added to the model using a forward selection method and model fit compared using likelihood ratio tests (LRT). The LRT method evaluates the change in deviance (\u0394G2) caused by the addition of a term to a model (Kleinbaum & Kleinbaum, 1998), hence, was used to compare nested models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to compare non-nested models with models with lower AIC values preferred over models with higher AIC values (Akaike, 1974). All comparisons were considered significant at an alpha less than 0.05. The final selected models were used as the source to generate the score weights for the clinical signs.",

The score weights and cut-points of these scoring systems were selected using statistical estimation, in contrast to previously described systems in which score weights and cut-points were determined subjectively. All three scoring systems had excellent agreement with the WI score. The BRD1 scoring system correctly classified 91.5% of the calves in the study, but required handling calves without spontaneous cough in an attempt to elicit an induced cough. The BRD2 scoring system correctly classified 90.8% of the calves in the study and did not require additional calf handling to induce coughing, but had three levels of nasal discharge, instead of two. The BRD3 scoring system correctly classified 90.2% of the enrolled calves, did not require additional calf handling to attempt inducing a cough, and included only dichotomous predictors for all the clinical signs. Given similar performance to the WI scoring systems, our BRD scoring systems require less qualitative assessment of clinical signs and hence offer simpler algorithms for on-farm diagnosis of BRD in pre-weaned dairy calves. Specifically, BRD3 would be most feasible on dairies and calf raising facilities for daily observation of large calf numbers in intensive dairy systems, this is due to the simplicity of the dichotomized clinical signs and reduced calf handling required to obtain the final score. Specifically, the BRD3 scoring system will require handling a calf for rectal temperature measurement only when a calf\u2019s total score based on all other clinical signs is equal to or greater than 4. At that time, a rectal temperature of 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F) or greater will increase the calf\u2019s score beyond the scoring system\u2019s cut-point of 5. Nevertheless, the three scoring systems developed in this study are described and presented to demonstrate the selection process and allow end users to select the system that best suits their needs.",

Prior to this study, the WI scoring system was the most widely accepted scoring system used in dairy medicine, but important pieces of information about this system, such as methods used to assign Scp and Sp, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and reliability, are absent from peer-reviewed literature. Further, the WI system uses 5 clinical predictors, each with 4 levels, and only uses four of these predictors to assign a score to the calf since the lower score of eyes and ears are dropped from the score. The systems presented here use 6 clinical predictors each with 2 levels, with the exception of nasal discharge in the BRD2 score, which has 3 levels, and use all 6 clinical predictors to assign total scores. It is anticipated that the inclusion of fewer levels of clinical predictors will improve the reliability and acceptance of the score.",

Identification of cases and controls without a gold-standard is a common challenge in epidemiologic studies. Case definitions that are based on multiple criteria are employed frequently and considered suitable so long as the criteria are appropriate for the goals of the study (Coggon et al., 2005). The algorithm, shown in Fig. 1, was developed to best identify cases and controls based on the available data. The detection of a primary pathogen for BRD, such as BRSV, using a sensitive and specific method, such as qPCR, indicates a high index of suspicion that the pathogen is present and the calf has BRD. The isolation of opportunistically pathogenic organisms, such as P. multocida and Mycoplasma bovis, is a much less specific criterion for BRD because these bacteria are commonly isolated from cattle without BRD. The specificity of bacterial isolation was improved by incorporating clinical information quantified by the WI scores. The WI system can be a useful method to quantify clinical BRD signs and was effectively employed in this study because two of the researchers were veterinarians with substantial calf experience which allowed for consistent evaluation and scoring of calves for BRD at enrollment. Classification as a case using the combined results of the WI score and bacterial isolation is a form of serial test interpretation, a strategy used to improve test specificity and reduce false positive results (Thurmond & Johnson, 2004).",

The conditional probability that Si,total \u2265 Scp given i was a case, and that Si,total < Scp given that i was a control, could be interpreted as cut-point specific estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively. However, these values were not interpreted as sensitivity and specificity in this study because of concerns that these estimates may be biased compared to the true sensitivity and specificity, due to two potential sources of selection bias. The first source arises from the use of the WI score in the case definition because the clinical signs used by the WI score were also included as predictors in the models for the BRD1, BRD2, and BRD3 systems. Hence, sampling of the cases and controls may not have been independent of the predictors in the model, resulting in biased parameter estimates. Although it is expected that the incorporation of microbiological results would reduce such a bias, caution is required when interpreting the estimated coefficients as causal measures of association. However, since the estimated coefficients were used to assign relative score weights, not to quantify causal associations, the method is acceptable for this application. The second source of bias arises from the pair-matched design of original study, which may have caused the sampled controls to be more similar to the cases and not representative of the referent population of all healthy calves on the facility. The CLR models account for the artificial similarities between cases and controls, but the ROC analysis used to select the optimal cut-points does not. Further research is needed to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of all three presented BRD scoring systems. Diagnostic methods such as thoracic ultrasound, auscultation, and hematology should be used to diagnose BRD in calves and estimate the sensitivity and specificity. While the methods listed are not gold-standards for BRD diagnosis, methods of estimating test sensitivity and specificity using imperfect tests have been described (En\u00f8e, Georgiadis & Johnson, 2000). Furthermore, any proposed scoring systems should be validated using an independent data set.",

While multiple subtypes of BCoV in cattle have been described, including respiratory and enteric calf diarrhea subtypes, based on the clinical presentation of infected cattle, no antigenic or genetic markers have been found to consistently differentiate the subtypes (Saif, 2010). Previous research has also established that animals infected with either subtype will shed viral particles in nasal secretions (Cho et al., 2001a; Cho et al., 2001b; Hasoksuz et al., 2002). Hence, the results of the BCoV PCR cannot be relied on to distinguish respiratory BCoV from enteric strains being shed from nasal mucosa.

Similarly, some observational studies have found significant associations between BCoV exposure and BRD (Storz et al., 2000), while others were unable to detect an association between serologic evidence of exposure to BCoV and incidence of BRD (Martin et al., 1998; Plummer et al., 2004).",

Several potential explanations exist for why these viruses were not detected. A greater proportion of cattle in the western US are vaccinated for BHV-1 and BVDV than other parts of the United States (USDA, 2007). It has been shown that increasing the proportion of vaccinated individuals causes an increase in age at infection thereby lowering disease prevalence in younger populations (Keeling & Rohani, 2008). A 2003 study of dairy calves in this region of California found only two calves out of 434 (0.5%) from two herds to be persistently infected (PI) with BVDV at birth (Munoz-Zanzi et al., 2003). It is expected that the prevalence of persistently infected calves on this facility in 2011 was even lower due to the facility\u2019s selectivity of clients and the increased mortality of PI calves during the first few weeks of life. Since PCR assays for each calf were performed using material collected and stored in a single vial, the presence of positive results for BRSV and BCoV (both enveloped RNA viruses) would seem to indicate sample handling was also sufficient for BHV-1 and BVDV (enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, respectively) had they been present. The absence of BHV-1 and BVDV in this population, and subsequent omission of these viruses from the case definition algorithm, may limit the validity of the presented systems to detect cases of BRD in other populations where these pathogens may be more prevalent. Further studies in calves infected with BHV-1 and BVD viruses are required to validate the accuracy of the current scoring systems.",

This change was made because logistic regression models assume that the joint effects of variables relate to the odds of an outcome in a multiplicative, not additive, manner (Breslow & Day, 1980). Therefore, the sum of the ORs as determined by multivariable logistic regression does not necessarily represent the OR of disease in an individual with multiple exposures compared to an individual with no exposures. Another method that determines Sp values based on logistic regression coefficients instead of ORs has been described (Sullivan, Massaro & D\u2019Agostino, 2004); however the pair-matched case-control design of the current study was incompatible with Sullivan\u2019s method.",

Calves with abnormal ear or head carriage, or calves with nasal discharge and one other clinical sign, or calves that have any three clinical signs are BRD cases based on the BRD3 scoring system. Only calves with nasal discharge or calves with two other clinical signs (spontaneous coughing, ocular discharge or abnormal respiratory) would require handling the calf to measure its rectal temperature and confirm BRD status if the temperature is \u226539.2\u00b0C or 102.5\u00b0F.",
