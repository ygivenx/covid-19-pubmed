We found that IFN-\u03b2 levels in cells expressing full-length PA-X was two-fold higher than cells expressing truncated PA-X (P < 0.05) (Fig. 7C).

Pigs are proposed to be \u201cmixing vessels\u201d or opportune intermediate hosts for the generation of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential1415. Despite the pivotal role of pigs in the ecology of influenza A viruses, few virulence markers of influenza virus in pig are identified. Based on the fact that SIVs with truncated PA-X have been gradually increased and became dominan5, we investigate whether truncation of PA-X could adapt SIV for enhanced growth and transmission in pigs. We observed that truncation of PA-X promoted viral growth in PK15 cells and swine respiratory tissues infected ex vivo, increased the viral replication, pathogenicity and transmission in swine, and we further demonstrated that the altered ability of PA-X in suppressing IFN-I expression might responsible for these changes. These results suggested that SIV with truncated PA-X seemed to present a selective advantage in pigs, which is in accordance with the fact that the proportion of SIVs possessing truncated PA-X has continually increased and have become predominant in nature. In contrast, our previous study found that the 2009 H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 influenza viruses with full length PA-X showed higher replication levels in A549 cells than those with truncated PA-X, and that virus with full length PA-X enhanced viral replication and pathogenicity in mice16. Coincidently, all of the avian and human influenza viruses possessed full-length PA-X in nature. Therefore, we speculate that the role of length of PA-X is associated with host specificity.",

            "text": "IFN-I consist of several structurally related IFN-\u03b1 proteins and a single IFN-\u03b2 protein, together with interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), they establish an antiviral state in infected cells that function to inhibit viral replication and restrict viral spread17. To escape the antiviral response of the host, several viral proteins have been shown to suppress IFN-I expression, including vhs from herpes simplex virus (HSV) and nsp1 from severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), that is necessary for efficient virus growth and virulence181920212223242526. For the influenza virus, the newly identified PA-X protein, along with NS1, PB2, PB1, PA and PB1-F2 have been demonstrated to be involved in the IFN-I response modulation27. The most prominent IFN-I antagonist in influenza virus is the NS1 protein which can suppress the IFN-I response by interacting with RIG-I and TRIM25282930. Graef et al. demonstrated that the PB2 subunit of the influenza virus RNA polymerase complex interacted with MAVS and inhibited MAVS-mediated IFN-\u03b2 expression31. Additionally, the other polymerase proteins PB1 and PA were identified as part of the IFN-I inhibitory strategy evolved by influenza virus and suggested to interact with RIG-I, subsequently inhibiting RIG-I mediated IFN-I signaling32. Effects outlined of the PB1-F2 are strain specific, however interferon suppression seems to be a common property, as A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) as well as PR8 (H1N1) strains both exhibit IFN-\u03b2 antagonism27. More recently, Hayashi et al. reported that the presence of PA-X in A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) also resulted in a suppression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA production through the shutoff activity of PA-X, leading to more efficient viral replication and more severe lung pathology in infected cells and mice9. Here, we clearly showed that truncated PA-X was more effective in inhibiting IFN-I mRNA expression in PAMs and pigs through the shutoff activity of PA-X, which is consisted with the enhanced replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility of PA-X mutants in pigs. Therefore, our study provides evidence that the adaptation of SIV in pigs may be partly due to the shutoff activity of PA-X.",

Nine pigs from each group were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 of tested virus, delivered in a final volume of 2 ml per nostril, using a mucosal atomization device (MAD, Wolfe Tory Medical, Inc.) to mimic aerogenic infection. Five uninfected pigs were maintained as a control group and were mock-inoculated with 2 ml PBS per nostril, using the same method as the infected pigs. Three infected pigs from each group were removed to a separate room with three na\u00efve pigs at 2 days post-inoculation (dpi). Clinical signs were observed by veterinary inspections at a fixed time daily throughout the duration of the study (14 days). Nasal washes were collected from all pigs at 3, 5, 7, and 9 dpi. At 3 and 5 dpi, three pigs from each infection group and one pig from control group were anesthetized and their nasal turbinates, tracheas, and lungs were collected for virus titration.",
