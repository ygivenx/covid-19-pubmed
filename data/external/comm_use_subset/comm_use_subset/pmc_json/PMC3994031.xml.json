            "text": "Dengue infection, commonly called bone breaker illness, is mosquito (Aedes aegypti/Aedes albopictus) borne. This disease ranges across tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, especially in Asian and Latin American countries. The global incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold in recent decades. It was recently estimated that 50\u2013100 million dengue infections occur each year and almost half of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where dengue is endemic [1]\u2013[2]. DENV belongs to the Flaviviridae family with four distinct serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4). Infection with any of these serotypes causes clinical symptoms including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Due to the absence of a suitable vaccine, effective, early and rapid diagnosis against all serotypes of DENV is of significance to reduce the morbidity and mortality of DHF and DSS, especially in developing countries [3]\u2013[4]. DENV contains a single open reading frame of approximately 11 kb with three structural (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [5]. NS1 is one of the most important nonstructural glycoproteins (40\u201350 kDa) and is considered to be immunogenic either secreted as a soluble hexamer form or as a membrane-associated protein on DENV infected cells [6]\u2013[7]. NS1 represents an interesting target antigen for diagnosis due to its presence in the blood of infected patients mostly from days 1\u20136 after the onset of clinical symptoms and in significant amounts from days 6\u201310 in both primary and secondary infection [8]\u2013[9].",

Many methods have been explored and used to diagnose dengue infection, including virus isolation [10], viral RNA direct detection [4], virus-specific IgM antibody detection [11], antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assays [12]\u2013[13] and immunochromatographic assays [14]. Among these methods, the gold nanoparticle-based immunochromatographic assay has drawn much attention as a promising tool for the development of a biosensor for early and rapid detection of the disease. Usually, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are used for immunochromatographic assays [14]\u2013[16]. Although there are many advantages of MAbs in biomedical research, there are also several limitations, such as the long time period and effort required, especially in the cloning and selection process, to obtain a successful monoclonal antibody.",

Nanobodies are the smallest intact antigen-binding fragments (around 15 kDa) that have full antigen-binding capacity in the absence of light chains due to their long CDR3 and good shelf-life [18]\u2013[20]. These new VHH domains with their versatile structural and functional properties form the basis of a new generation of antibodies for the diagnosis of infectious diseases as they bind to the pocket and cleft of the targeted antigen [21]. So it is highly likely that nanobodies will be potential tools in the development of biosensors based on immunochromatographic assays.",

The data output was characterized as the value of the observed response units (RU) from the sample cells minus the RU from the reference cell (Figure 5). The dissociation constant (KD) was evaluated from the kinetics parameters of association (ka) and dissociation rate constants (kd) by fitting the data using the BIA evaluation 3.1 software (GE Healthcare). The KD value of the P2 VHH antibody was 2.79\u00d710\u20138 M, which was within the range of KD values of most VHHs for their target antigens [33]\u2013[35], while P10 and P13 had lower binding affinities (data not shown). The KD value for the 3B3 monoclonal antibody was 5.74\u00d710\u20136 M (Table 1), which was nearly the same as some other studies [14], [36]. Furthermore, both of antibodies did not display cross reaction with other His-tagged HIV-p24 recombinant proteins (expressed in our laboratory). Based on these findings, P2 VHH antibody was assumed to be the most suitable for comparison with 3B3 MAb in further studies (rapid diagnostic tests and epitope mapping).",

For this recombinant NS1 protein of dengue type 2, 4.5 ng/ml and 9 ng/ml detection limits were observed visually for the VHH antibody (P2) immobilized kit and monoclonal antibody (3B3) immobilized kit, respectively. The test lines for every concentration of antigen in the VHH antibody immobilized strips were a little darker than those in the monoclonal antibody immobilized strips (Figure 6). To evaluate the sensitivity, inactivated viral culture supernatant of dengue type 2 containing native NS1 was used because dengue type 2 positive blood samples were not available from any hospital in Guangzhou, China. This viral culture supernatant was diluted in ratios of 1\u223610, 1\u223620, 1\u2236100, 1\u2236150 and 1\u2236200 in 0.85% NaCl and tested on both types of strips. A parallel experiment was performed with commercially available SD Bioline Dengue Duo (NS1/IgM/IgG) kits (Kyonggi-do, Korea) to compare and check the accuracy of diagnosis of the kits prepared in the present study. The color intensity of the T line was compared with a standard color test card developed by Wondfo (Guangzhou, China). Strong detection levels based on the color of the T line were observed for dilutions 1\u223610 and 1\u223620, but the level gradually became weaker for other dilutions (Table 2). The VHH immobilized strips displayed higher sensitivity with the appearance of darker colored T lines for each dilution as compared to the monoclonal antibody immobilized strips and the commercial kit. The native NS1 detection level of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit prepared in the present study was consistent with that of the commercial kit. The end point dilution/limit dilution of detectable NS1 in the viral culture supernatant was 1\u2236150 for the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit and the commercial kit. But for the VHH antibody immobilized kit, the end point dilution was 1\u2236200. The color of the T line was weak and difficult to identify at the limit of dilution. The sensitivity indicated that the performances of both kits prepared in the present study were accurate. Thus, VHH antibody immobilized kit exhibited a higher sensitivity with a 1\u2236200 dilution limit as compared with our monoclonal antibody immobilized kit and the commercial kit with dilution limits of 1\u2236150.",

Therefore, P2 antibody was selected for epitope mapping and compared with 3B3 MAb to determine whether different or similar epitopes were involved in the responses during the evaluation of kits. The phage clones were isolated by incubating the 12-mer linear random peptide library with the monoclonal antibody (3B3) and VHH antibody (P2) after three rounds of bioscreening. For the two antibodies, a total of 20 phage clones were picked. The inserted DNA fragments of the selected phage clones comprised 36 nucleotides and were translated to 12 amino acid residues. The peptide sequences of the epitopes and the rNS1 protein sequence of DENV2 were aligned and their homology compared. Sequence analysis revealed several different binding epitopes on rNS1 protein identified by all clones but the C-terminal region of amino acids 224\u2013232 was found to be homologous for all clones. For the VHH antibody (P2), seven independent phage clones were obtained after biopanning of the 12-mer library. Among them, ten clones (designated as V1) had the same peptide sequence WHWSYWPGDNRA and another five clones (designated as V2) had the same peptide sequence FHWSWSMQSAAT. Interestingly, these two peptide sequences (WHWSYWPGDNRA and FHWSWSMQSAAT) were the same in both monoclonal and VHH antibodies. When comparing the 12-mer peptide sequence of seven different clones displayed by selected phage binders with the DENV2-rNS1 protein sequence, the peptide sequences for the seven different clones were found to be similar to the sequence of rNS1 amino acids 224\u2013232 (C-terminal region). V1, V2 and V3 (LHWQWWPRQMAS) sequences aligned with the motif 224\u2013232 of rNS1 that had the consensus motif HWxxxxxxW with strongly conserved histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan (Figure 7A).",

The sensitivity of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit was consistent with that of the commercial kit with a 1\u2236150 dilution limit for the detection of native NS1 in DENV2 culture supernatant whereas the VHH immobilized kit displayed a higher sensitivity with a 1\u2236200 dilution limit. The specificities of the two kits prepared in the present study were also compared with the commercial kit. The specificity of VHH antibody immobilized kit was higher (99.50%) than that of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit (95.24%) and the commercial kit (98.04%). This comparison study of VHH and monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kits with the commercial kit revealed that kits developed in the present study are reliable and fast. Because of the high target specificity, affinity and ease of production of VHH antibody, the rapid diagnostic kit based on VHH antibody was found to be more efficient and economical and it displayed better sensitivity and specificity results compared to the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit.",

            "text": "Epitope mapping is crucial for understanding the nature of immune responses and diagnostics [49]. Identification of the epitopes requires the preparation of highly specific antibodies. After the successful generation of MAb and VHH antibodies against DENV2-rNS1, the antigenic epitopes were identified by biopanning of a commercially available phage display peptide library (Ph.D 12 kit) using P2 and 3B3 antibodies as targets. After three rounds of panning, phage clones capable of binding to both antibodies were enriched, showing an increase in titer in the case of the VHH antibody compared to the monoclonal antibody. Sequence analysis revealed that there was only one rNS1 epitope residue (corresponding to residues 224\u2013232), which was identical for all clones in both kinds of antibodies. The two peptide sequences WHWSYWPGDNRA (same in V1 and M1 clones) and FHWSWSMQSAAT (same in V2 and M2 clones) were predicted to be the mimotopes on rNS1. The homologous region of the rNS1 sequence (aa224\u2013232) was assessed as a potential epitope for both kinds of antibodies, which indicates that histidine and tryptophan are probably key components in almost all of the clones and form the antigenic epitope (Figure 7A, 7B). These amino acids may play an important role in antibody binding. Similarly, Wu et al. [50]\u2013[51] used serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies to identify the epitopes of DENV1-NS1 and DENV2-NS1 from a random peptide library displayed on a phage. They also found that histidine was the most important amino acid for antibody binding. In consequence, this study revealed that the rNS1 epitope residues 224HWPKPHTLW232 in the C-terminus epitope region are conserved for both monoclonal and VHH antibodies with similar antigenic epitopes.",

            "text": "In conclusion, selection of VHH against DENV2-rNS1 from a non-immune llama library by a phage display technique proved to be very successful within 4 weeks. Furthermore, VHH expression from E. coli and purification within 1 week holds great promise for future large scale production in a cost-effective way. Compared to hybridoma technology, this protocol requires less time and no animal immunization. Selection and screening of positive VHH clones are also accurate and fast. Thus, extensive isolation and production of single domain antibodies become affordable. The comparison of monoclonal and VHH antibodies for the identification and screening of NS1 epitopes may provide better information for developing serological tests. Both kinds of antibodies have similar NS1 epitopes that might be involved in the diagnosis of DENV2 infections. There is no big difference between the sensitivity and specificity of VHH and monoclonal antibody immobilized kits, but better visible results with the VHH antibody immobilized kit indicate that VHHs are more versatile and suitable for binding the pocket or cleft of targeted antigens due to their long CDR3 regions as compared to monoclonal antibodies. All of these findings indicate that VHH offers similar or better results than conventional monoclonal antibody. Therefore, VHH antibodies offer a promising alternative for developing commercial diagnostic tools. One limitation of the present study is the unavailability of DENV2 positive serum samples from hospitals. Further work is still needed to determine the sensitivity of the rapid diagnostic kits with a large number of dengue positive serum samples collected at different times in the course of infection.",
