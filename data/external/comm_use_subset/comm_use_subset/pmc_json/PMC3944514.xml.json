            "text": "Small organic molecules have proven to be important tools for biological systems research, but there is still much to learn from their use. From the 150,000 structures in the CRC Dictionary of Natural Products (NPs) only approximately 1% of them have at least one biological test results described in the MDL Drug Data Report database (MDDR) [1], which has been compiled by Prous Science from the patent literature since 1988. NPs or synthetic products inspired by NPs have been the single most productive source leads for the development of drugs. In fact, more than half of the approved drugs from 1981 to 2010 are based on NPs [2]. At the turn of the 21st century, a new branch of NPs chemistry had been fully established\u2014Marine Natural Products (MNPs). In fact, the future seems very promising for this new branch since MNP chemists have already elucidated the chemical structure of over 22,000 novel compounds [3]. Moreover, from these, 7 are already approved drugs [4], (four anticancer, one antiviral, one pain control, and one hypertriglyceridemia). The success rate of drug discovery from the marine world is 1 drug per 3140 natural products described. This rate is approximately 1.7- to 3.3-fold better than the industry average (1 in 5000\u201310,000 tested compounds) [5]. Nowadays, there are facilities for high-throughput screening available both in academic labs or in drug pharmaceutical companies, but the cost of random screening for very large collections of compounds can nevertheless be prohibitive, making chemoinformatics approaches for the virtual screening of the most probable active compounds valuable tools. Although in the last few years chemoinformatics approaches have been applied for in silico screening of natural products [6,7,8,9,10,11,12], this is a field that can be significantly improved by the modeling of data from large databases containing information relative to biological activities, which are becoming available to the scientific community. Besides the virtual screening, the computational methods can be very useful to build appropriate databases, allowing for effective short-circuits of NP extracts dereplication procedures [13], which will certainly result in increasing the efficiency of drug discovery. An example of a powerful database is AntiMarin [14], which contains approximately 50,000 compounds from marine macroorganisms and both marine and terrestrial microorganisms. AntiMarin is the result of a merger between AntiBase [15] (a database of all terrestrial and marine microbial natural products) and MarinLit [3] (a database of marine natural products literature). Bacteria are an exceptional source of chemical diversity. Among them, species of the order Actinomycetales (commonly called actinomycetes) are the single most productive source of microbial derived natural products, accounting for ca. 75% of all antibiotics discovered [16], as well as a broad range of anticancer agents. Although the actinomycetes are best known as soil bacteria, a growing interest in its distribution and ecological role in the marine environment has been observed. Therefore, besides marine natural products (MNPs) we will refer the NP derived from microbial source as microbial natural products MbNPs, accounting for those of terrestrial origin.",

The models were developed using 1804 active and non-active compounds from the PubChem database. Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RFs) and Classification Tree (CTs) models, were compared to predict the two classes (i.e., active and non-active compounds) in the following classification task: (1) the overall biological activity; (2) the antitumor activity; and (3) the antibiotic activities from CDK descriptors.",

As was expected the overall CT biological model shows poor prediction accuracy\u2014a G-mean of 0.21 for test set I. With the overall biological activity model, we intended to improve the precision of lead-like profiling by compensating for the lack of bioactivity records in the 1192 compounds extracted from the AntiMarin database. Like in other databases, in the AntiMarin database each molecule has been tested for only a few activities chosen by the researchers or grant programs, so there are probably many bioactive molecules that lack an activity record, because they have never been tested against other biological screens. With this problem in mind we would expect that the difficulty with this model was actually the false positives (FPs) for the test set II. Indeed, we obtained a large number of FP for the test set II, as shown by the low specificity value of 0.32 obtained for the best model (RF) compared with the high specificity value of 0.78 obtained for the test set I, Table 1. The analysis of the results obtained from RF and SVM models has shown that there are 176 and 12 FP, common to both models, for the test set II and I, respectively. For these FP, it was obtained an average probability of being active (Prob_ave_act) in the RF model of 0.68 (80 FP have a Prob_ave_act \u2265 0.7), and 0.61 (2 FP have a Prob_ave_act \u2265 0.7) for the test set II and I, respectively. Many authors have tried to rationalize the drug-like and lead-like nature of compounds, Waldmann et al. [8] suggested through a statistical analysis of the structural classification of natural products that more than half of all natural products have just the right size to serve as a starting point for hit and lead discovery. The lead-like molecules must have a scaffold with two, three, or four rings, and their van der Waals volumes must match the lower end of the majority of the protein cavities (i.e., van der Waals volume between 300 and 800 \u00c53 [8]). The analysis of the active and non-active profiles of the van der Waals volume of the 2706 compounds from PubChem (training set and test set I) and 1192 compounds from AntiMarin (test set II) containing different ring numbers demonstrated that the non-active compounds from AntiMarin present a higher number of compounds having three and four rings with the right size than those from PubChem (Figure 1).",

In the test set I, there are 225 compounds with these specifications. From those 216 compounds (i.e., approximately 96%) are active compared with only 195 active compounds (i.e., approximately 72%) from the 271 AntiMarin (test set II) compounds with the same specifications. On the other hand 188 and 178 compounds were predicted as true positive (TP) with a Prob_ave_act of 0.72 and 0.74 using the RF model for test set I and II, respectively. Moreover, for the test set II, 67 compounds were predicted as FPs, compared with only 4 FPs for the test set I, with a Prob_ave_act of 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. Additionally, we use the Lipinski rule-of-five (R-o-5) to analyze the RF activity model. The R-o-5 is widely used as a filter in drug discovery to evaluate drug likeness and to verify if a compound with some activity has properties that would make it a possible orally active drug in humans. It is applied in the optimization of activity, selectivity and drug-like properties of lead compounds. Beside its wide application, it should be emphasized that the R-o-5 does not really predict if a compound is active, the Lipinski rule states that a compound that is more likely to be an orally active drug and easily absorbed by the body has no more than one violation of the following criteria: a molecular weight less than 500, an estimation of the octanol-water partition coefficient not greater than 5, a sum of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in a molecule not more than 10 and, a total number of potential hydrogen-bond donors not more than 5 [17]. This criterion was applied to test set II and the filtered compounds that conform to the R-o-5 were analyzed and compared to the RF performance for the same set of filtered compounds. Similarly to the RF model with the application of the R-o-5 to test set II a large number of FPs emerged, 202 (212 FP by the RF model). From those Lipinski\u2019s FP compounds there were as well 108 compounds that were predicted as FP by the RF model with a Prob_ave_act of 0.61.",

Interestingly, from the 28 FPs, 26 MNPs and MbNPs (i.e., 25 MbNPs and 1 MNP) were classified as being antibiotic by the RF antibiotic model with an average probability of being antibiotic (Prob_ave_antibiotic) of 0.82, compared with only 3 MNPs and MbNPs (i.e., 1 MbNP and 2 MNPs) that were classified as being antitumor by the RF antitumor model with an average probability of being antitumor (Prob_ave_antitumor) of 0.56. From those 26 FPs, 6 (IDs 105, 106, 573, 647, 860 and 992) were predicted as being antibiotic with a probability of being antibiotic (Probantibiotic) greater than or equal to 0.9 using the RF antibiotic model. Although no biological activity was recorded for the butirosin A analogs (IDs 105, 106 and 647, see Scheme 1) in the AntiMarin database, the work of Woo et al. [18] had shown an improved antibiotic activity of deoxy derivatives in the \u03b1-d-glucopyrasonyl unit (namely IDs 105, 106 and 647) over butirosin A (a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic). Moreover, this study had referred also to the advantageous effect of the 5-amino function in the \u03b2-d-xylofuranosyl unit (e.g., IDs 105, 106) as compared with the 5-hydroxyl group of butirosin A and MbNP ID 647, against some, but not all, of the organisms studied. The 1-N-acyl derivative of the arbekacin (ID 573 see Scheme 1), was identified as being resistant to many inactivating enzymes while retaining most of the intrinsic antibiotic activity of the unsubstituted molecules against susceptible strains [19]. As far as we know, the bioactivity of the 3\u2032-N-demethylated derivative (ID 992, see Scheme 1) of gentamicin C1 (a naturally occurring broad-spectrum antibiotic) has never been recorded. However in accordance with the literature we expect that this derivative may be active since it carries a methyl group on N-6\u2032, which appears to be responsible for the resistance to N-acetyltransferase enzymes as referred for the gentamicin C1 and C2b [19]. The aklavinone glycoside, ID 860 Scheme 1, is a parent aglycone of an extensive family of glycosidically derived anthracycline antibiotics possessing significant anticancer activity, although the specific activity of this MbNP has not yet been reported. The aglycone, luteolin, of the flavonoid, luteolin-7-O-\u03b2-glucoside (ID 917, Scheme 1) has been shown to inhibit a series of human cancer cell lines [20,21] (renal A-549, ovary SK-OV-3, melanoma SK-MEL-2, XF-498, HCT15, gastric HGC-27), breast MCF-7 [22] and human leukemia cells [23]. More recently, additional antitumor assays have suggested that luteolin-7-O-\u03b2-glucoside could be an interesting antitumor NP, even more active in the breast adenocarcinoma cell than its aglycone [24]. Although the bioactivity of the MNP, ID154, has never been recorded, the high toxicity of those cortinarin derivatives was extensively reported [25]. ",

For instance, the overall biological activity appears to be related with the electronic and molecular descriptors. The CPSA, BCUT and WHIM descriptors seem to have a main role in modeling the overall activity. The BCUT descriptors encode connectivity information and atomic properties of the molecule [45]. The WHIM descriptors are weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors that are built in such a way to capture relevant molecular 3D information with respect to molecular size, shape, symmetry and atom distribution [46]. While the antitumor activity appears to be largely related with the topological descriptors. In addition, the molecular distance edge descriptors (MDE), which evaluate molecular distance edge descriptors for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms, seems to be the most important type of the descriptors for modeling the antitumor activity (4 MDE descriptors out of the ten most important descriptors). Only the MDEO-12 (molecular distance edge between primary and secondary oxygen atoms) and the khs.sssCH (a fragment count descriptor that encode the presence of a tertiary carbon group in which it has three single bonds) descriptors were selected for all machine learning techniques (i.e., CFS filter for SVM, the two measures of the RF, and CT). The MDEO-12 is the most important descriptors for the MeanDecreaseAccuracy parameter in the RF model and it is as well the first descriptor selected to build the antitumor classification tree (see a graphical representation of the first two rules of the antitumor tree in Figure 2).",

The MDEO-12 descriptor is known to codify the molecular size by taking into account oxygen atoms also characterizes polarity [48]. Inspection of the compounds belonging to the training set reveals that this descriptor provides an indication of the presence of oxygen-containing groups such glycosyl, amide, lactam, ester or lactone together with hydroxyl, carboxylic acid or ether functional groups.

The training and test sets comprise of the following biological categories of compounds: 1367 antitumor, 992 antibiotic, 59 antifungal, 11 antimalarial, one anti-HIV, 79 anti-microbial, 152 cytotoxic and 206 non-active. It is important to refer that some compounds have more than one bioactivity record. The non-active compounds were selected on the basis that were at least screened for one biological activity. The whole data set (2706 compounds) was divided into a training set of 1804 compounds and a test set of 902 compounds, which was used for the development and external validation of the QSAR classification models. The approximate 2:1 partition was carried out randomly according to the antitumor, antibiotic, and non-active categories in such a way that both sets span the biological diversity of the data set. A further test set (test set II), which comprises 1192 MNPs and MbNPs was extracted from the AntiMarin database [3,14,15]. The chemical structures of the MNPs were downloaded in the MDL SDF format. As some drug molecules from PubChem originated from natural sources origin, there is some overlapping between the two databases. After assembling these two databases, the duplicates were removed, although the chirality was taken into account, racemic compounds (or cases where the stereochemistry was not indicated) were considered as one of the possible stereoisomers. The SMILES strings of the three different data sets, the natural source for the compounds of test set II, and the corresponding experimental and predicted activities are available as Supplementary Information.",

This heuristic takes into account the usefulness of individual descriptors for predicting the activitiy (i.e., overall biological, antitumor, or antibiotic) together with the level of intercorrelation among them. The experiments for comparing the descriptors for each one of three models were conducted with the AttributeSelectedClassifier routine of Weka with the CfsSubsetEval option as descriptor evaluator and the BestFirst or GreedyStepwise option as search method.

Each node is produced by a logical rule, usually defined for a single descriptor, where objects below a certain descriptor\u2019s value fall into one of the two child nodes, and objects above fall into the other child node. The prediction for a compound reaching a given terminal node is obtained by a majority vote of the objects (in the training set) reaching the same terminal node. The CT models were built using the 232 CDK descriptors.",

The best split at each node was defined among a randomly selected subset of descriptors. Prediction is made by a majority vote of the classification trees in the forest. Additionally, performance is internally assessed with the prediction error for the objects left outin the bootstrap procedure (internal cross-validation or OOB estimation). The method quantifies the importance of a descriptor by the increase in misclassification occurring when the values of the descriptor are randomly permuted, correlated with the mean decrease in accuracy parameter, or by the decrease in a node\u2019s impurity every time the descriptor is used for splitting, correlated with the mean decrease in the Gini coefficient parameter. RFs also assign a probability to every prediction on the basis of the number of votes obtained by the predicted class. A measure of similarity between two objects can be calculated from the number of trees in the ensemble that classify the two objects in the same terminal node. RFs were grown with the R program, version 2.13.1, using the Random Forest library [63]. The RF models were built with 500 trees and using the set of 232 CDK descriptors. As a result of the nature of two-class imbalance in the overall activity model, this problem was alleviated setting the class weights to 50:50.",

With nonlinear data, kernel functions can be used to transform it into a hyperspace where the classes become linearly separable. In this study, SVM were established with the Weka 3.6.5 program, using the LIBSVM package [65,66,67,68]. The type of SVM was set to C-SVM-classification and the kernel function was the radial basis function. The parameter C of the C-SVM-classification was optimized in the range of 10\u2013500 and the default \u03b3 parameter in the kernel function was used. The descriptors selected by the CFS procedure were normalized and used to develop the classification models.
