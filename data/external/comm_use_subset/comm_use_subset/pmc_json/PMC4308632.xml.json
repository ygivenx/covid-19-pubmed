LQC is composed of 11 herbs including Fructus Forsythiae (Lianqiao), Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (Jinyinhua), Herba Ephedrae (Mahuang), Semen Armeniacae Amarum (Kuxingren), Radix Isatidis (Banlangen), Rhizoma Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis (Mianmaguanzhong), Herba Houttuyniae (Yuxingcao), Herba Pogostemonis (Guanghuoxiang), Radix et Rhizoma Rhei (Dahuang), Radix et Rhizoma Rhodiolae Crenulatae (Hongjingtian), and Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae (Gancao), along with menthol and a traditional Chinese mineral medicine, Gypsum Fibrosum (Shigao). According to previous reports, LQC has a good clinical effect on influenza with the symptoms of high fever, aversion to cold, headache, pharyngalgia, cough, sneezing, muscle ache, and so on [3]. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that LQC also has the antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities [4, 5]. Recently, the study on its bioactive ingredients and molecular mechanism of action has been gradually reported as well [6].",

A total of 61 compounds were unambiguously or tentatively identified by comparing the retention times, exact molecular masses, and MS/MS spectral data with reference compounds or literature data. Furthermore, twenty-seven compounds were confirmed by comparing with the standards. Among them, twelve representative compounds were quantified as chemical markers in quantitative analysis, including salidroside, chlorogenic acid, forsythoside E, cryptochlorogenic acid, amygdalin, sweroside, hyperin, rutin, forsythoside A, phillyrin, rhein, and glycyrrhizic acid.

The LODs and LOQs were 0.051\u20131.71 \u03bcg/mL and 0.16\u20135.69 \u03bcg/mL, independently. Twelve analytes in sample solution were stable at room temperature within 48 h with the RSD less than 2.76%. The RSD values of intraday and interday precisions were less than 1.10% and 2.92%, respectively. The RSD of repeatability was less than 2.39%. The average recovery rates of 12 compounds ranged from 92.99% to 103.95% with the RSD less than 3.54%. All the results showed that the assay was satisfactory with high accuracy, good reproducibility, and high sensitivity which were beneficial to the analytical investigation and quality control for LQC.",

To date, there has not been a systematical and comprehensive study on the chemical profiling and quality control method for LQC. Therefore, an accurate, sensitive, and reliable quality control procedure for LQC is in urgent need to be established. In our study, the chemical profile of LQC was thoroughly and systematically investigated by UPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS for the first time. Sixty-one compounds were unambiguously or tentatively identified. Based on the qualitative analysis, a UPLC-DAD method was established for quantitative analysis of 12 representative compounds in LQC, which has been demonstrated to be effective for the analysis of 10 batches of LQC. This developed method could be applied as an effective quality control procedure for LQC. In addition, this study would be a powerful reference for the identification of similar compounds presented here, such as flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, anthraquinones, triterpenoids, and iridoids by MS spectra.",
