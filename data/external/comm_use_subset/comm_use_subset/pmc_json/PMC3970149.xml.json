            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was first recognized as a devastating enteric disease in feeder and fattening pig, resembling transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in pigs in the United Kingdom, in 1971. It is a member of Coronavirinae, which are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with the largest genome that are known to infect humans, other mammals, and birds, usually causing subclinical or respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) subgenomic mRNAs, which are transcribed from the genome, produce viral proteins, such as the spike (S, 180\u2013220 kDa), envelope (E, ~8.8 kDa), membrane (M, 27\u201332 kDa), nucleoprotein (N, 55\u201358 kDa), and several other proteins of unknown function [1,2,3]. Among the proteins, N, as the RNA-binding protein, play an important role in both virus RNA synthesis and modulating host cell processes, and phosphorylation may regulate these processes by exposing various functional motifs [4,5]. Several other functions have been postulated for the coronavirus N protein throughout the virus life cycle, including encapsidation, packaging, correct folding of the RNA molecule, the deregulation of the host cell cycle [6,7,8], inhibition of interferon production [9,10], up-regulation of COX2 production [11,12], up-regulation of AP1 activity [13], induction of apoptosis [14,15,16], association with host cell proteins [17], and RNA chaperone activity [18]. Therefore, it is clear that N is a multifunctional protein involved in biological processes related to the survival of PEDV.",

            "text": "How viral and cellular proteins traffic to the nucleolus and what determines their sub-nucleolar localization is not clearly understood, but proteins that localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus or nucleolus contain multiple signals that determine their subcellular localization [26], such as nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). Active nuclear import of proteins is mediated by nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which are then recognized by proteins of the importin super-family (importin \u03b1 and \u03b2) that mediate the transport across the nuclear envelope using Ran-GTP [27]. Similar to nuclear import, export of a protein from nucleus depends on the presence of a specific nuclear export signal (NES) [28]. The chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1; also known as exportin 1 or Xpo1) has been identified as an export receptor that interacts with the predominant NES, the so-called leucine-rich NES, which is found in a large variety of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins [29,30]. In fact, some of these NESs are not necessarily leucine rich but rather characterized by several hydrophobic residues. The pharmacological compound leptomycin B (LMB) directly interacts with CRM1 and blocks NES-mediated protein export [31]. Therefore, the proteins can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm with their subcellular localization signals.",

Within the Alphacoronavirus coronaviruses, the precise NoLS and NES of PEDV N and its traffic mechanism are still elusive. Therefore, we have attempted to characterize these signals, and the molecular mechanism responsible for its subcellular localization. In this study, we examined the intracellular localization of the PEDV N protein in PEDV-infected and transfected cell lines using mouse polyclonal antisera and confocal microscopy. By generating a series of deletion and mutagenesis constructions, we found that amino acids 71-90 in region 1 were sufficient for nucleolar retention and we also identified two NESs (aa221\u2013236 and 325\u2013364), but only the NES (aa325\u2013364) was found to be functional in the context of the full-length N protein. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of N and the nuclear export of GFP-NES could be blocked by LMB, an inhibitor of the CRM1, which is the receptor for exportin-1-dependent nuclear export. ",

Predict NLS [32] and PSORT II [33] were used to identify potential NLSs, and the NES predictor (Net NES) [29] was used to identify potential NESs. Predict NLS found no NLSs, whereas PSORT II indicated that PEDV N protein contained a pat7 motif (261PKKNKSR267). Net NES found no NES. In other studies, coronaviruses, such as TGEV, MHV, IBV, and SARS-CoV showed a common characteristic, that of NLS-rich in C-terminal. So through amino acid sequence comparison among groups we also found a basic amino acid-rich short peptide (383RKKEKKNKRE393) in C-terminal. We presumed it might play a role in N protein localization as a new localization signal, and named it patx. Although N protein contains putative nuclear (or nucleolar) localization signals (N (or No) LS), it is not known whether they are functional or not. To investigate whether these and other unknown signals operated to determine the subcellular trafficking of N protein, we utilized AcGFP as a fusion marker to observe the localization characteristics of N and truncated N protein in live cells. The B23.1-DsRed fusion protein was used to tag the nucleolus, so we could analyze nucleolar localization properties and colocalization in cotransfected cells by live cell imaging (direct fluorescence) or confocal microscopy. At 24 h post-cotransfection, live cell imaging indicated that as previously shown, AcGFP evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolar, on the contrary AcGFP-N protein localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus but not the nucleus in Vero E6 cells (Figure 3). From the above results we hypothesize that there is a NoLS in N, which can guide exogenous protein to the nucleolus. To determine the exact NoLS, the AcGFP-tagged truncated different regions of the N protein were transfected into Vero E6 cells, which did not destroy the integrity of the signals. In our observation, AcGFP-NR1 mainly localized to nucleolar structures, AcGFP-NR2 localized predominantly to the cytoplasm and appeared also to accumulate in the nucleolus to the low level as the cytoplasm, whereas AcGFP-NR3 predominantly localized to the cytoplasm; AcGFP-NR1+2 protein same to AcGFP-N and localized to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, AcGFP-NR2+3 protein localized predominantly in cytoplasmic (Figure 3). This evidence demonstrated that region 2 targeted to the nucleolus with weaker enrichment, while region 1 localized to the nucleolus with stronger enrichment. Thus, we speculated that region 1 have an effect on the nucleolar localization of N. This data also suggested that region 2 and 3 may contain NESs because region 2 and 3 was mainly directed to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, although region 2 and 3 contained predicted pat7 and patx motifs, respectively, they could either have been submissive to the NES or not functional. None of these fusion proteins had a distribution similar to AcGFP only. ",

To further refine the amino acids involved in nucleolar localization, 20 amino acid overlapping motifs encompassing amino acids 51\u2013100 were cloned into downstream of AcGFP, creating plasmids pAcGFP-NR151\u201370, pAcGFP-NR161\u201380, pAcGFP-NR171\u201390, and pAcGFP-NR181\u2013100 for the expression of recombinant fusion proteins.

Comparison of the PEDV N protein NoLS with known cellular and viral NoLSs showed that the R87 and R89 of the PEDV N protein NoLS might be conserved, although some cellular and viral NoLSs in this site did not contain basic amino acids (Figure 6).

These expression plasmids were transfected into Vero E6 cells, the nuclear was stained with DAPI at 24 h post-transfection indicated that amino acids 148\u2013220 directed AcGFP to the cytoplasm and nucleus and had a subcellular localization similar to AcGFP.

To further define the amino acids involved in cytoplasm trafficking, we conducted a tetra-alanine substitution mutagenesis of amino acids 221\u2013240. These were placed down stream of AcGFP, creating expression plasmids, pAcGFP-NR2221\u2013224DLVA-AAAA, pAcGFP-NR2225\u2013228AVKD-AAAA, pAcGFP-NR2229\u2013232ALKS-AAAA, pAcGFP-NR2233-236LGIG-AAAA and pAcGFP-NR2237-240ENPD-AAAA. Therefore, in some cases, the wild-type alanine was not substituted. The data indicated that substituting 221-224DLVA-AAAA, 229-232ALKS-AAAA, and 233-236LGIG-AAAA abolished cytoplasm trafficking. The remaining tetra-alanine substitutions had no effect on cytoplasm trafficking (Figure 8), indicating that amino acids 221 DLVAAVKDALKSLGIG 236 were involved in cytoplasm trafficking. To test whether this amino acid sequence was involved in directing the cytoplasm trafficking of N protein, this motif was deleted in the context of full-length N protein tagged to AcGFP (plasmid pAcGFP-N\u2206221\u2013236). This plasmid was transfected into Vero E6 cells and the subcellular localization of the resulting fusion protein AcGFP-N\u2206221\u2013236 investigated using confocal microscopy. There was no difference at 24 h post-transfection (Figure 9) compared with cells expressing AcGFP-N protein.

In this case, most proteins should contain the appropriate trafficking motifs, such as NLS. The rules and signals that govern the nuclear localization of proteins are well defined. NLSs can be classified into several categories, including the pat4 and pat7 motifs and bipartite NLSs, are composed of basic amino acids of a given sequence length. The pat4 motif consists of a continuous stretch of (usually) four basic amino acids, and the pat7 motif starts with a proline residue and is followed by six amino acids [32,53]. By contrast, the signals that govern nucleolar localization and retention are not well defined [26]. The motifs involved are usually rich in arginine and lysine residues; however there is no immediately obvious consensus sequence or structure. Proteins that localize to the nucleolus can also have nuclear-import motifs. The NoLSs that have been identified so far can be grouped into those that contain single motif and those that contain multiple motifs [54].",

The characteristics of AcGFP-N protein localized to either the cytoplasm alone or the cytoplasm and nucleolus, with a maximum of 60% of transfected cells exhibiting this phenotype at 24 h. Our studies indicated that fusing AcGFP with PEDV N protein increased the molecular weight of this protein (82 kDa) above the size exclusion limit of the nuclear pore complex, and it could not diffuse passively through the NPC. This result suggested that there must be some signals in N protein that determined the nucleolar localization. A number of viruses and viral proteins can disrupt nucleolar architecture [57], and the N protein of coronavirus can also localize to the nucleolus in a cell cycle dependent manner and this may be related to dynamic trafficking [58]. A previous study of SARS-CoV indicated the N protein inhibited B23 phosphorylation and might influence ribosome biogenesis to suppress host gene expression and create a more favorable milieu for virus survival [25], so the N protein of PEDV might take part in some cellular process.

            "text": "To investigate whether PEDV N protein contained a NoLS, the protein was expressed as a series of single and overlapping regions. This preliminary analysis indicated that PEDV N protein contained a NoLS in region 1. Deletion mutagenesis delineated amino acid PEDV N 71\u201390, a 20 aa motif that modulated nucleolar localization. Furthermore, comparison with cellular and viral NoLSs, the data indicated that R87 and R89 may be critical for the nucleolar localization. For the site of replication and virus assembly is the cytoplasm, if the subcellular localization of the nucleocapsid protein is in the nucleolar, then the protein is not available for RNA synthesis, encapsidation and assembly, and therefore progeny virus production might be less efficient. However, if such proteins do target the nucleolar as part of a virus replication strategy then they will contain appropriate targeting signals. Thus, these will include not only NLSs and NoLSs, but perhaps more importantly NES. By using a series of N deletion mutants fused to the AcGFP and tetra-alanine substitution mutagenesis, we identified two NES site in region 2 (aa221\u2013236) and region 3 (aa325\u2013364), but NES in region 2 was deleted in the context of full length N protein did not affect cytoplasm trafficking, suggesting that the NES presented in region 2 submissive to the NES in region 3 or not function. Furthermore, PEDV N protein nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was specifically blocked by LMB treatment suggested that PEDV N protein is transported via the classical CRM1-dependent pathway.",

The cloning procedures for constructing most of recombinant plasmids were similar and all primers are listed in Table 1. At all times, numbers used in primer or construct names denoting amino acid numbers refer to their position on the full length N protein. For the Tetra-alanine substitution, each pair of oligonucleotide strands was annealed, and the resultant double-stranded DNA fragments were cloned into the vector pAcGFP-C1. Additionally, the NES of NR2 was deleted in the context of full-length N protein by overlapping PCR using forward primer 1-U and reverse primer 1-L (Table 1) to generate one PCR product and forward primer 2-U and reverse primer 2-L (Table 1) to generate the second PCR product. A second round of PCR was performed using both PCR products as templates and 1-U and 2-L as the forward and reverse primer, respectively. The resulting product was subcloned into pAcGFP-C1.
