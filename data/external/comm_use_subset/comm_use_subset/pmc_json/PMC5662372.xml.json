            "text": "Risk factors relating to the development of asthma attacks are multiple and complex. The frequency of viral respiratory infections (VRIs) in asthma attack patients is now recognized as having a major impact on asthma pathogenesis in children.[1] Kusel et al[2] reported that VRIs caused by human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the first year of life were strongly associated with the diagnosis of current asthma and persistent wheeze in 5-year-old children. Furthermore, Jackson et al[3] demonstrated that children had an increased risk of asthma at 6 years of age if they experience wheezing in the first 3 years of life, with RSV [odds ratio (OR): 2.6], HRV (OR: 9.8), or both HRV and RSV (OR: 10). Regarding adult asthma patients, previous reports showed that respiratory tract infections associated with asthma exacerbation ranged from 10% to 21% to 45%,[4\u20136] of which 60% are HRV.[7] However, especially in Japan, few epidemiological data exist on the correlation between VRIs and asthma attacks in adult patients[1,8] from studies conducted within the year.[9]",

However, the epidemiological data of HRV associated asthma attacks in adults were scarcely reported in Japan. In this regard, the present study showed that HRV-A or HRV-C has a potential role in asthma attacks among Japanese adult patients, with a wide genetic divergence. As shown in Fig. 1, the detection of HRV was most common in autumn, indicating that the common cold, which results from HRV during the fall months, can lead to asthma attacks as reported in previous studies.[19] Furthermore, previous reports described other respiratory viruses, such as hMPV,[20] RSV, parainfluenza virus, Inf-V, and coronavirus, as a cause of asthma attack in adults,[4] and the present study clearly demonstrated the main causative viruses are HRV, hMPV, RSV, and Inf-V.",
