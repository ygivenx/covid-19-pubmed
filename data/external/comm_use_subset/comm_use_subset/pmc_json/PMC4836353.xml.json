Several pandemics, such as the Spanish flu (1918), Asian flu (1957), and Hong Kong flu (1968), caused millions of deaths in the last century (1). Currently, only two therapies, targeting the viral proteins neuraminidase and M2, are approved to treat influenza. Therefore, novel viral or host targets for antiviral strategies to block viral replication or inhibit cellular proteins necessary for the virus life cycle are urgently needed (2). In this context, host proteases are a group of very promising antiviral targets, because proteolytic cleavage of the precursor hemagglutinin (HA0) into HA1 and HA2 subunits by host proteases is essential for fusion of HA with the endosomal membrane and thus represents an essential step for infectivity of the virus (3, 4). Due to the potential risk of side effects after application of broadband protease inhibitors, the specific inhibition of a single enzyme would convey a huge therapeutic benefit.",

These HAs are cleaved by host trypsin-like proteases (5\u20138). In vitro studies with cultured human respiratory epithelial cells demonstrated the involvement of several membrane-associated proteases (9). Cell culture studies further identified, among others, the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11D as enzymes able to cleave the HAs of influenza virus subtypes H1 and H3 (10\u201312). We previously showed that deletion of Tmprss2 in knockout mice strongly limits viral spread and lung pathology after H1N1 influenza A virus infection (13). An essential role for TMPRSS2 in cleavage activation and viral spread was also reported for H7N9 influenza A virus (14, 15). We also demonstrated that deletion of Tmprss2 slightly reduced body weight loss and mortality in mice after H3N2 virus infection compared to those for wild-type mice but did not protect mice from lethal infections (13, 15). Therefore, it is likely that in addition to TMPRSS2, other trypsin-like proteases of the respiratory tract are able to cleave the hemagglutinin of H3 influenza viruses.",

Tmprss4 mutant mice were generated by using a replacement vector targeting the Tmprss4 gene in 129SvEv embryonic stem (ES) cells (19).

After incubation, a 1% Avicell overlay prepared in DMEM containing NAT and BSA was added and incubated for an additional 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 4% formalin, and viral particles were detected with an anti-influenza virus antibody (Virostat). For detection of nonprocessed viral particles, lung homogenates were diluted in DMEM plus 0.1% BSA without NAT. After washing of MDCK II cells, homogenates were added and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterwards, the inoculants were removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. A 1% Avicell overlay containing BSA and NAT was added, and the assay was processed according to the above protocol.",

Sections (0.5 \u03bcm) were cut from three evenly distributed levels of paraffin blocks and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemical studies, sections were stained overnight at 4\u00b0C with a primary antibody against influenza A virus nucleoprotein (clone hb65; ATCC, Wessel, Germany). Subsequently, tissue sections were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Biozol) and counterstained with hematoxylin (22). Semiquantitative assessment of influenza virus antigen expression in the lungs was performed as reported earlier (23), with the following minor modifications. For the alveoli, 25 arbitrarily chosen 20\u00d7 objective fields of lung parenchyma per lung slide were examined by light microscopy for the presence of influenza virus nucleoprotein, without the knowledge of the identities of the animals. The score for each animal was presented as the percentage of positive fields. For the bronchi and bronchioles, the percentage of positively staining epithelium was estimated for every slide to provide the score per animal, as follows: 0, 0% staining; 1, 1 to 25% staining; 2, 25 to 50% staining; and 3, >50% staining. For immunofluorescence analyses, 12-\u03bcm-thick cryo-sections were air dried, fixed in acetone at \u221220\u00b0C, and rehydrated in PBS. Slides were blocked with anti-FCR (1:500; purified rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32). Primary antibodies used were AF350-conjugated rabbit anti-TMPRSS4 polyclonal antibody (Bioss) and Cy5-conjugated rabbit anti-TMPRSS2 antibody (Antikoerper-Online). Both antibodies were checked on appropriate knockout slides to exclude potential cross-reactivity. After staining, the slides were washed with PBS, dried, and mounted with Neo-Mount (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Analyses were performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope with a 40\u00d7 oil immersion objective. For in situ hybridization (ISH) studies of type I alveolar epithelial cells (AECI) and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII), 5-\u03bcm-thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections were used with a QuantiGene ViewRNA ISH tissue assay kit (Affymetrix, Cleveland, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions. Type 6 (Sftpc; for AECII) and type 1 (Aqp5; for AECI) QuantiGene ViewRNA probes were generated based on Affymetrix probe sets. The GenBank accession numbers for the probe sequences are as follows: for type 6 probes (Sftpc), NM_011359 (region 2\u2013784); and for type 1 probes (Aqp5), NM_009701 (region 239\u20131533). Pretreatment was performed for 10 min at 90 to 95\u00b0C, and protease digestion was performed for 20 min at 40\u00b0C. Slides were stained with Fast red for type 1 probes. Type 6 probes were detected with Fast blue. Slides were then counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin. Negative controls (antisense) were run in parallel and showed no hybridization signals (not shown) (type 6 [Sftpc-neg] negative control [region 23\u2013803], covered by probe set NM_011359-N; and type 1 [Aqp5-neg] negative control [region 172\u20131122], covered by probe set NM_009701-N).

We performed in situ hybridization (ISH) analyses to differentiate between type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECI and AECII, respectively) in noninfected mouse lungs. As shown in Fig. 1A, round and mostly cuboidal AECII were detected by expression of the cell type-specific marker surfactant-associated protein C (Sftpc; stained blue). Thin and flat AECI could be identified by expression of the cell type-specific marker aquaporin 5 (Aqp5; stained red). In addition, we used immunohistochemical staining to detect expression of both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4. Staining could be observed in cuboidal and granular cells of alveolar tissue, representing AECII (Fig. 1B), as well as in the bronchiolar epithelium (Fig. 1C).",

To prevent artificial HA cleavage and following viral entry into MDCK II cells by addition of exogenous trypsin, the homogenates were incubated on the cells without additional proteinase in the medium. Under these conditions, only completely matured virus particles will enter cells and form foci. We were able to detect a significant smaller amount of matured virus than the total amount of virus in samples from double-knockout mice (Fig. 7). In contrast, no difference was observed in wild-type samples with and without trypsin treatment. Taken together, these data show that TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 mediate activation of H3N2 influenza A viruses by cleavage maturation of viral hemagglutinin progeny and that deletion of these host factors results in reduced viral replication, spreading, and pathogenesis.",

Influenza viruses are dependent on host cell factors for cell entry and replication. The identification of such host factors and an understanding of their role during the influenza virus life cycle are of great importance for the development of novel therapeutic targets. In particular, host proteases that exhibit trypsin-like activity, such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D (HAT), ST14 (matriptase), KLK5, KLK12, TMPRSS11E (DESC1), and TMPRSS13 (MSPL), have been shown to cleave influenza virus HAs with a monobasic cleavage site and to support multicycle virus replication in cell culture (11, 27, 29\u201331). Notably, altered TMPRSS2 expression was identified as a susceptibility marker for severe A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H7N9) influenza virus infections in humans (32). On the other hand, the trypsin-like proteases prostasin, hepsin, TMPRSS3, TMPRSS6, TMPRSS9, TMPRSS10, TMPRSS11B, and TMPRSS11F did not activate HA upon coexpression in mammalian cells (10, 31, 33).",

Furthermore, bronchiolar damage was more severe in wild-type mice than in double-knockout mice on all days. Thus, the increased mortality rate for wild-type mice is most likely caused by a higher degree of tissue destruction by the virus at early time points.

An increased expression of TMPRSS4 was associated with increased progression and metastatic potential of several cancers (36). TMPRSS4 transcripts have been detected in the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon), the urogenital tract (kidney and bladder), mouse bronchiolar-alveolar epithelial cells, and human lung tissue (27, 37, 38). Nevertheless, the in vivo function of this protein is still unclear. A recent study showed that the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel is not affected by deletion of Tmprss4 (19). For lung tissue, TMPRSS2 expression has been described for human bronchial epithelium, AECII, and alveolar macrophages (10, 24). We confirmed the expression of Tmprss2 and Tmprss4 in the alveolar region and the bronchial epithelial cells of murine lungs and showed that both proteases were coexpressed in granular and roughly cuboidal cells, representing AECII. In other studies, influenza A virus antigens were detected almost exclusively in AECII and, to a lesser degree, in alveolar macrophages (25, 26). This colocalization of host proteases and virus strongly suggests that both proteases can be recruited for HA maturation.",

            "text": "The protease cleavage site (PEKQTR) of the mouse-adapted H3N2 variant (17) which was used in our studies is identical to the cleavage site in the original human isolate (A/Hong Kong/01/68 H3N2). In general, seasonal influenza viruses of the H3 subtype cause more severe symptoms in humans than H1 viruses. One may thus hypothesize that the increased accessibility of the H3 HA to more than two proteases allows for more efficient replication of H3N2 viruses, which may be associated with more severe pathology. The more proteases are able to cleave the hemagglutinin, the faster the virus can replicate and cause illness. It has been shown that increased expression of TMPRSS2 leads to more severe outcomes of human disease caused by the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus or the novel avian H7N9 virus (32). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the H1 (PSIQSR) and H3 (PEKQTR) cleavage sites shows three differences (also see Fig. 9 in reference 13). However, it is likely that specificity and efficiency for protease cleavage are determined not only by the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site but also by the overall tertiary or quaternary structure. The HA cleavage site of the H7N9 virus, which is also cleaved by TMPRSS2 (14, 15), supports this view, as it consists of the amino acids EIPKGR, which are quite different from both the H1 and H3 cleavage sites. Therefore, it will be important to investigate the structures of both proteases and hemagglutinins to determine the molecular mechanisms of HA cleavage susceptibility and efficiency.",

            "text": "It should be noted that deletion of Tmprss2 did not change the tropism of H3N2 virus infection in mice (13). This is consistent with the observation that both proteases are expressed in the same cell types. Thus, after removal of Tmprss2 alone, Tmprss4 is still able to activate the HAs of H3N2 viruses, and vice versa. Survival rate was increased only after deletion of both proteases due to reduced viral loads in the lungs. Although virus replication was decreased, we still detected processed HA protein, viral spreading, and pathology. From these data, we conclude that in addition to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, further proteases are able to cleave and activate the hemagglutinin of H3N2 viruses. Different proteases have been shown to activate H3 viruses in vitro (11, 29\u201331). TMPRSS11D (HAT) is expressed mainly in the murine trachea and bronchi and is thought to cleave HA mainly in the upper regions of the lower respiratory tract (14, 39, 40). Furthermore, kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) was described to cleave H1 and H3 HAs (30), tryptase Clara (TPSB2) was reported to cleave H3 HA (5), and matriptase (ST14) cleaves H3 HA to a certain degree (29). A recent study also reported that the host proteases TMPRSS11E (DESC1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) are capable of cleaving H1, H2, and H3 HAs in vitro (31).",
