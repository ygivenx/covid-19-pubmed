Furthermore, RSV is the leading cause of infant hospitalizations creating an immense healthcare burden for treatment and prevention [1, 2, 7\u201311]. There is currently no licensed vaccine for RSV. During a primary RSV infection, the CD8 T cell response is crucial for mediating viral clearance [12, 13]. Depletion of CD8 T cells in mice prior to RSV challenge leads to elevated viral loads, but also ameliorates morbidity [12]. Thus, CD8 T cells contribute to both viral clearance and immunopathology following an acute RSV infection. RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells also contribute to protection from a secondary infection [12]. Antibody-mediated depletion of memory CD8 T cells in RSV-immune mice impairs viral clearance following re-infection as compared to non-treated controls [12]. Thus, vaccines that elicit robust memory CD8 T cell responses may help promote long-lived immunity against RSV.",

In contrast, studies have demonstrated that robust memory CD4 T cell responses can mediate vaccine-enhanced disease following RSV infection [18, 19]. Adoptive transfer of activated effector RSV-specific CD8 T cells, in vitro stimulated T cell lines, or in vitro propagated T cell clones leads to enhanced RSV clearance from the lung following RSV challenge. These effector CD8 T cell transfers were also associated with increased weight loss, indicating that infusion of effector CD8 T cells can induce increased systemic disease [20\u201323]. However, the role of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against RSV infection remains unclear. Evaluating the capacity of memory CD8 T cells to mediate protection against RSV infection is critically important because high neutralizing antibody titers alone are insufficient to prevent RSV-induced disease in every individual [14, 24].",

We employed a dendritic cell-Listeria monocytogenes (DC-LM) prime-boost immunization regimen to induce high magnitude, RSV epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses in naive mice. A similar prime-boost immunization strategy has been shown to elicit protection against other respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [25, 26]. DC-LM immunization induced robust memory CD8 T cell responses that reduced viral titers following RSV challenge. However, despite enhanced viral clearance, immunized mice experienced increased pulmonary disease, weight loss, and mortality. Exacerbated disease and mortality was unique to the context of an RSV infection as immunized mice were protected against challenge with a lethal dose of a recombinant IAV expressing an RSV-derived CD8 T cell epitope. The lethal immunopathology observed in immunized mice was caused by rapid and excessive IFN-\u03b3 production by memory CD8 T cells in the airways. Our studies reveal that memory CD8 T cells enhance RSV clearance similar to other viral infections, but are unique in that they mediate severe immunopathology caused by the overproduction of IFN-\u03b3.",

            "text": "Peptide-coated, mature DCs can be utilized to prime a CD8 T cell response that allows for robust secondary expansion following a booster immunization in mice [27]. To induce RSV-specific CD8 T cell memory in the absence of virus-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies, naive mice were immunized with matured splenic DCs loaded with M282-90 (M282) peptide and boosted 7 days later via infection with an attenuated, recombinant LM strain expressing the M282 epitope. A control group without RSV-specific CD8 T cell memory was generated by immunizing mice with DCs not exposed to peptide followed by a boost with an LM that did not express an RSV-derived epitope. DC-LM immunization led to a significant (p<0.001) increase in M282-specific CD8 T cell frequencies following the LM booster inoculation within the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) compartment as compared to the control group (Fig 1A). Approximately 20% of all CD8 T cells in the PBL were M282-specific at day 42 post-boost (Fig 1A). Immunized mice challenged with RSV exhibited a significant (p<0.001) reduction in lung viral titers by day 4 post-infection (p.i.) compared to the control group undergoing a primary RSV infection (Fig 1B). As expected, immunized mice exhibited an increased number of total and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung by day 5 p.i. as compared to non-infected M282-immunized controls (Fig 1C and 1D). In addition, there was a greater frequency (p<0.001) of IFN-\u03b3+ and IFN-\u03b3+TNF+ CD8 T cells following M282 peptide re-stimulation at days 4 and 5 p.i. as compared to control groups (Fig 1E). Thus, DC-LM immunization elicited robust memory CD8 T cell responses that mediated enhanced viral clearance following RSV challenge.",

Despite enhanced viral control, M282-immunized mice exhibited a significant (p<0.01) decrease in survival (Fig 2A). Approximately 40% of fatalities were due to M282-immunized mice naturally succumbing to RSV infection, while 60% were euthanized upon reaching a humane weight loss endpoint. This outcome was both unexpected and unusual since an acute RSV infection is rarely fatal in adult BALB/c mice. M282-immunized mice also exhibited significantly (p<0.05) increased weight loss (Fig 2B) and reduced pulmonary function (Fig 2C and 2D). Additionally, we evaluated lungs by histology for evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), an acute form of lung injury [30, 31]. If severe and extensive enough, DAD is the foundational lesion in the clinical syndrome known as acute respiratory distress syndrome. M282-immunized mice revealed increased (p<0.001) histopathological evidence of characteristics associated with early stages of DAD including cellular sloughing and necrosis, alveolar hemorrhage, early cellular infiltrates, and hyaline membrane formation (Fig 2E and 2F and S2 and S3 Figs).",

Thus, it was unclear if the increased disease severity observed in M282-immunized mice was unique to the M282-90 epitope. To address this possibility, we evaluated mice immunized against the F85-93 (F85) CD8 T cell epitope following RSV infection [33]. Similar to M282-immunized mice, F85 DC-LM immunization induced a high frequency of RSV F85-specific memory CD8 T cells that mediated a decrease in lung viral titers at day 4 following RSV challenge (S4A and S4B Fig). In addition, F85-immunized mice exhibited increased mortality, weight loss, and pulmonary dysfunction as compared to controls (S4C\u2013S4F Fig). Thus, the severe immunopathology induced by memory CD8 T cells was not specific to either a particular epitope or an RSV protein. We next determined if RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells would also cause increased disease in C57BL/6 mice, as an acute RSV infection in this mouse strain typically causes only mild disease [34]. Therefore, we immunized C57BL/6 mice against the immunodominant M187-195 (M187) CD8 T cell epitope [35]. DC-LM immunization targeting the M187 epitope resulted in approximately 33% M187-specific CD8 T cells in the PBL by day 28 post-boost (S5A Fig). Similar to M82-immunized BALB/c mice, M187-immunized C57BL/6 mice exhibited significantly reduced lung virus titers (p<0.001), decreased pulmonary function, and increased weight loss following RSV infection (S5B\u2013S5E Fig). However, in contrast to M282-immunized BALB/c mice, all of the M187-immunized C57BL/6 mice survived following RSV infection. This data indicates that M187-specific CD8 T cells also contribute to immunopathogenic responses in the C57BL/6 genetic background.",

Slutter et al. recently used a similar DC-LM prime-boost strategy to elicit IAV-specific memory CD8 T cells and demonstrated protection against a subsequent IAV infection [25]. Similar to RSV challenge, immunized mice infected with IAV-M282 exhibited a significant increase in the number of total and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung by day 5 p.i. (S7 Fig). IAV-M282 infection also resulted in a significant (p<0.05) increase in monocytes and decrease in eosinophils compared to non-infected M282-immunized controls (S7 Fig). CD4 T cell, Treg, neutrophil, and NK cell numbers were not significantly altered in IAV-M282 challenged mice (S7 Fig). As anticipated, all control mice, which do not have virus-specific memory CD8 T cells, succumbed to a lethal IAV-M282 challenge. However, in contrast to the significant (p<0.001) mortality observed in M282-immunized mice following RSV challenge, M282-immunized mice were protected against a lethal IAV-M282 infection (Fig 3A). Pre-existing M282-specific memory CD8 T cells also prevented the prolonged weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction observed in control mice following IAV-M282 infection (Fig 3B\u20133D). Furthermore, weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction following RSV challenge were significantly (p<0.05) increased at early timepoints compared to IAV-M282 infected mice (Fig 3B\u20133D). In addition, M282-specific memory CD8 T cells induced a significant (p<0.001) reduction in IAV titers at both day 4 and day 6 p.i. (Fig 3E). These data indicate that pre-existing RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cells mediate enhanced IAV-M282 clearance and promote increased survival of mice by preventing prolonged disease. To confirm that memory CD8 T cells would also provide protection without extensive immunopathology to a lower viral inoculum, we challenged M282-immunized mice with a sublethal dose of IAV-M282. Similar to a lethal dose of IAV-M282, M282-immunized mice experienced significantly (p<0.05) improved pulmonary function and less weight loss as compared to the control group following a sublethal infection (S8 Fig). Thus, memory CD8 T cells do not promote distinct patterns of disease severity between sublethal and lethal IAV infections. These results indicate that lethal immunopathology associated with a high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell response is unique to the context of an RSV infection.",

To evaluate the effects of local immunization, DC-M282-primed mice were either not boosted, given a systemic LM-M282 boost intravenously (i.v.), or given a local IAV-M282 boost intransally (i.n.). Administration of an IAV-M282 boost induced a significant (p<0.001) increase in the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung prior to RSV challenge as compared to a systemic LM-M282 boost (S9A and S9B Fig). We next utilized intravascular staining to determine the localization of cells within the lung following immunization [37, 38]. The majority of M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung of DC-M282-primed mice that were either not boosted or boosted systemically with LM-M282 were located within the pulmonary vasculature (S9C Fig). In contrast, greater than 85% of M282-specific CD8 T cells were localized within the lung tissue in IAV-M282-boosted mice, resulting in a significant (p<0.001) increase in total number as compared to LM-M282-boosted mice (S9C and S9D Fig). In addition, local boost in the lung with IAV-M282 induced a large frequency of RSV-specific CD8 T cells within the lung tissue expressing both CD69 and CD103, which represent the canonical markers of resident memory CD8 T cells.

Assessment of TNF levels at day 2 following RSV challenge revealed similar levels between control- and M282-immunized mice (S12F Fig). TNF levels in the lung were significantly (p<0.01) increased in M282-immunized mice at day 4 p.i. as compared to the control group, but no increase was observed in the serum (S12F Fig).

IFN-\u03b3 levels in M282-immunized mice remained elevated above controls at day 4 p.i., but the overall amount was reduced as compared to day 2 following infection. Interestingly, challenge with IAV-M282 resulted in significantly (p<0.001) greater IFN-\u03b3 protein levels in the lung at day 2 and day 4 p.i. as compared to challenge with RSV (S13A Fig). In contrast, serum IFN-\u03b3 and lung TNF levels in IAV-M282-infected mice were reduced (p<0.001) at day 2 but increased (p<0.001) at day 4 p.i. when compared to the levels observed following RSV challenge (S13B and S13C Fig).",

Leukocytes producing IFN-\u03b3 in vivo were readily identified using this previously established method (S14A Fig). Upon evaluation of the primary leukocyte populations present in the lung following RSV infection, only lymphocytes had produced IFN-\u03b3 in immunized mice at day 2 p.i. (Fig 4C). Only a small frequency of CD4 T cells and NK cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 were observed at day 2 p.i., whereas approximately 45% of CD8 T cells were producing IFN-\u03b3 (Fig 4C). These data also correlate with the rapid and transient increase in the amount of IFN-\u03b3 protein we observed in the lung and serum at day 2 p.i., as virtually no IFN-\u03b3-producing cells were recovered on day 5 p.i. (S14B Fig). The IFN-\u03b3 secreting CD8 T cells were largely CD11ahi, indicating that the majority were antigen-experienced T cells (Fig 4D) [44]. When comparing M282-specific T lymphocytes to all other CD8 T cells in the lung at day 2 p.i., half of M282-specific CD8 T cells produced IFN-\u03b3, whereas almost 30% of the remaining CD8 T cells were also producing IFN-\u03b3 (Fig 4E). These results indicate that both M282-specific and bystander antigen-experienced CD8 T cells secrete IFN-\u03b3 in immunized mice early following RSV infection. Lastly, we assessed IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells in the respiratory tract (lung and BAL), mediastinal lymph node (mLN), and periphery (spleen and PBL). The majority of CD8 T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 were localized to the lung and BAL (Fig 4F). In contrast, a relatively low frequency of CD8 T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 in the spleen and PBL, and virtually no IFN-\u03b3 production was observed in the mLN (Fig 4F). Taken together, these data demonstrate that antigen-experienced CD8 T cells in the airways of immunized mice secrete IFN-\u03b3 early following RSV infection leading to increased IFN-\u03b3 levels in both the lung and the periphery.",

To evaluate the role of IFN-\u03b3, we treated M282-immunized mice with either control IgG or anti-IFN-\u03b3 neutralizing antibody administered i.n at the time of RSV challenge. While high mortality was observed in the IgG-treated group, neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 led to the survival of all immunized mice (Fig 5A). In addition, weight loss and respiratory dysfunction were significantly (p<0.05) reduced in immunized mice following IFN-\u03b3 neutralization as compared to the IgG-treated mice (Fig 5B\u20135D). Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 did not significantly impact virus titers in the lung at day 4 p.i., suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 does not contribute to pathogen clearance in this prime-boost immunization model (Fig 5E). Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 resulted in significantly (p<0.001) decreased TNF levels in the lung at day 2 p.i. compared to IgG-treated controls (Fig 5F). Overall, our results suggest that antigen-experienced CD8 T cells rapidly secrete IFN-\u03b3, which mediates lethal immunopathology following RSV infection in DC-LM-immunized mice by promoting the production of TNF by other cell populations.",

Our results demonstrate that memory CD8 T cells, in the absence of RSV-specific CD4 T cell memory or antibodies, promote enhanced viral clearance following RSV challenge.

Furthermore, immunization against the immunodominant M187 epitope in C57BL/6 mice also caused increased weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction, but no mortality following RSV infection.

Memory CD8 T cells are protective and do not exacerbate disease severity with other respiratory viral infections such as IAV or SARS-CoV [25, 26]. Consistent with memory CD8 T cells being able to provide protection against IAV infection [25], we show that RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cells mediate protection following a lethal IAV-M282 infection. A systemic increase of IFN-\u03b3 was seen in immunized mice early 2 days following RSV infection. Antigen-experienced CD8 T cells in the airways were the primary source of IFN-\u03b3. The presence of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells only in the airways suggests that production was in response to antigen stimulation given the strong tropism of RSV to the epithelium and alveolar cells of the respiratory tract [47\u201349]. Interestingly, peak IFN-\u03b3 production occurred prior to the significant accumulation and/or expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the lung by day 5 p.i. This observation is similar to work by Liu et al. showing IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells prior to expansion of the CD8 T cell response following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection [43]. Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 prevented all mortality and reduced disease severity in immunized mice without impacting RSV titers. These data indicate that IFN-\u03b3 promotes the severe immunopathology, but does not contribute to viral clearance.",

Antibody-mediated neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 does not impact RSV viral titers during an acute infection indicating a minor role in viral clearance [42]. Induction of a Th1-biased immune response is important to prevent the pathology associated with a Th2-skewed response [42, 50\u201352]. Nonetheless, IFN-\u03b3 still contributes to minimal immunopathology associated with an acute RSV infection [42, 52]. However, treatment of mice with recombinant IFN-\u03b3 at early timepoints has been shown to protect against lethal IAV infection with no difference in viral clearance [53]. This result is consistent with our study showing that DC-LM immunized mice receiving a lethal IAV infection have significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 protein levels in the lung at early time points as compared to RSV challenged mice. Together, these results suggest that supplemental IFN-\u03b3 limits the severe pathology associated with a lethal IAV infection without contributing to viral clearance. Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 can play distinct roles by either contributing to immunopathology or ameliorating disease dependent upon the respiratory virus infection.",

Immunized mice deficient in perforin exhibited similar disease severity as WT controls following RSV challenge. In addition, all perforin-deficient mice eventually succumbed to infection whereas typically 10\u201320% of WT immunized mice survive. It has been previously demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 and TNF levels in perforin-deficient mice are elevated following an acute RSV infection, which likely contributes to the accelerated mortality we observed in M282-immunized perforin-deficient mice [42]. A role for regulating CD8 T cell expansion and cytokine production by perforin to prevent mortality has also been demonstrated for secondary CD8 T cell responses against LCMV [54, 55]. Lastly, the neutralization of TNF also improved survival and ameliorated disease in immunized mice following RSV infection. The cytokine TNF is known to contribute to both weight loss and inflammation during acute RSV infection [42]. Therefore, TNF plays a critical role in mediating immunopathology during both primary and secondary RSV infections.",

The DC-LM immunization utilized in our studies resulted in dramatically increased numbers of RSV-specific memory T cells compared to the immunization strategy employed by Lee et al. [56]. This disparity in RSV-specific memory CD8 T cell numbers prior to RSV challenge may account for the observed difference in outcome between our studies. It remains controversial whether a strong CD8 T cell response is desirable during RSV infection in humans. Experimental RSV infection of adult humans revealed that greater frequencies of virus-specific CD8 T cells in the BAL correlated with reduced clinical disease symptoms [57]. In contrast, a greater ratio of CD8 to CD4 T cells in the airways is associated with acute lung injury during common respiratory tract infections such as RSV [58].",

In adult volunteers experimentally infected with RSV, Jozwik et al. found that a higher baseline frequency of RSV-specific CD8 T cells in the airways correlated with a lower cumulative symptom score following RSV challenge [57]. Our results obtained by administration of a local IAV-M282 boost are consistent with this notion. Our data suggest that systemic RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are more prone to causing immunopathology, possibly in part due to their delay in reaching the lungs. However, the use of the human RSV challenge model cannot evaluate the protective capacity of memory CD8 T cells in the absence of RSV-specific memory CD4 T cells and antibodies as we have done here using our animal model. Thus, we believe our results are applicable to humans in cases where vaccination of an RSV seronegative individual would primarily elicit a CD8 T cell response.",
