The causative agents of diseases of unknown origin (DUOs) fall broadly into three groups: (1) known pathogens that were not tested for or misdiagnosed; (2) previously unrecognized but common pathogens (e.g., parechoviruses and human metapneumovirus); and (3) newly emerging or re-emerging pathogens (e.g., filoviruses, henipaviruses, and coronaviruses). All three categories are relevant to policymakers when trying to allocate resources for prevention. While the third category accounts for the smallest number of infections, the impact of emerging pathogens, particularly those with potential for human-to-human transmission, may range from disruptive to catastrophic. Developing an infrastructure to tackle these issues is challenging and costly, yet interventions that are implemented without supporting data on DUO frequency and population risk may prove ineffective.",

Approximately 60% of all human pathogen species are known to be zoonotic (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005) and pathogens that infect multiple species are three times as likely to emerge into human populations than host-restricted pathogens (Taylor et al. 2001). Some pathogens undergo enzootic transmission in reservoir animal populations with occasional spillover into a human host and little to no onward transmission (Jonsson et al. 2010; Wertheim et al. 2009). Other pathogens display human-to-human transmission after spillover and may result in large epidemics (Drosten et al. 2013; Gire et al. 2014; Janies et al. 2008). Some of these emerging pathogens may eventually adapt to circulate exclusively among humans, leading to epidemic or endemic transmission cycles (Holmes and Twiddy 2003; Taubenberger 2006). The frequency with which such zoonotic transmission events occur and the likelihood that a pathogen will adapt to exclusively human transmission are largely determined by behavioral and immunological factors in the host, along with ecological and evolutionary factors of the pathogen (Karesh et al. 2012).",

The aim to enroll 3000 cases under each clinical syndrome was based both on operational capacity and local epidemiology, specifically the ability to calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs) for specific pathogens (thus providing supporting evidence of disease etiology). These samples sizes were considered to be sufficient to estimate PAFs to informative levels of precision: for example, a pathogen found in 20% of 3000 cases and 40% of 1000 severe cases will give PAF = 33% with approximate 95% confidence intervals of 30\u201337%. From pilot data, we anticipated identifying a pathogen associated with the defined clinical syndromes in 50% of CNS cases, 60% of respiratory cases, 60% of enteric cases, and 30% of hepatitis cases; roughly 50\u201380% of these pathogens were predicted to be viruses.

Potential cohort members were identified and screened for suitability and, after providing informed consent, were asked to provide a blood sample, nose and throat swab, and a rectal swab, followed by the administration of a questionnaire to document socioeconomic factors, health-seeking behavior, occupational hazards, animal exposure, and food consumption habits. Participants are then interviewed and sampled annually to document risk factors for zoonotic infections, such as animal exposure, food consumption habits, and disease episodes within their household or among their animals. Throughout the three-year study, participants who develop illness are encouraged to visit the local study hospital or are visited at home by a member of the local Preventative Medicine Centre (PMC). The medical workers determine whether the illness is likely to represent an infectious disease episode and, if so, collect clinical samples from the cohort member and administer a disease episode questionnaire related to animal exposures. Additionally, the local sDAH are informed and a team of animal health workers visits the site within 48 hours of the reported disease episode for responsive sampling of representative animal species present at the study site (Figure 3).\n",

Within the context of VIZIONS, we are performing full and partial genome sequencing to characterize both ubiquitous and novel viral populations present in Vietnam. Using these sequences, we aim to identify principal zoonotic viral populations and investigate their dynamics in human and animal populations. Initial pathogens prioritized for investigation include rotavirus, hepatitis E virus, influenza A virus, and enteroviruses. For these and other viral populations that are found to be endemic in Vietnam or show extensive transmission, we will use phylogenetic methods to characterize their spatial and temporal spread through animal and/or human populations; these investigations will provide information on large- and small-scale networks of disease transmission within the country, with which we hope to gain a better understanding of the patterns and determinants of pathogen dispersal.",

These factors increase the frequency, duration, and intensity of wildlife, livestock, domestic animal, and human interaction (Rhyan and Spraker 2010). Vietnam now has unprecedented demands for meat from livestock, and many wildlife species are now commonly farmed (e.g., bamboo rat, wild boar, civet, porcupine) (Brooks et al. 2010; Drury 2009). The maintenance of large animal populations (domestic and wildlife species) generally involves supplemental feeding and the introduction of animals from other populations\u2014all factors that facilitate pathogen transmission (Wildlife Conservation Society 2008). Additionally, the presence of mixed wildlife and livestock populations on farms increases the risk of introduction of novel pathogens to potentially immunologically naive populations. Although human exposure to livestock is known to be an important risk factor for cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens in this region (Dinh et al. 2006; Ho et al. 2011; Mackenzie 2005), the risk posed by wildlife remains unknown; this is due partly to an incomplete understanding of wildlife farming and consumption practices.",

This has been a substantial resource for collaborating hospitals, where laboratory diagnoses are seldom performed and infections are typically identified through standard clinical observations. Therefore, we are developing a thorough understanding of the disease burden of many key pathogens across Vietnam but still have an alarming rate of DUOs, ranging from 42.6% (764 of 1792 samples screened) in diarrhea cases to 74.7% (464 of 621 samples screened) in CNS cases (2451/4624 cases overall across the four syndromes have no identified pathogen). While these results are not reported back to hospitals in real time, allowing an immediate improvement of clinical assessment, they are providing vital seasonal information regarding annual fluctuations in hospital attendance and disease etiology. A key lesson from the hospital component of the study has been understanding and accounting for the gaps in diagnostic capabilities for patients who present with a disease of a presumed infectious origin in the hospital setting. A lack of diagnostic technology and funding to perform adequate diagnostics is a major issue in the healthcare systems of many developing countries and leaves treating clinicians to make diagnoses based on medical intuition and experience alone. This impacts the quality and consistency of data coming in from hospital sites, requiring additional considerations and generalizations to be made in our analyses, particularly those dependent on epidemiological data collected directly from the hospitals. Furthermore, even though we are performing a considerable range of microbiological and molecular screening panels for major pathogens, the rate of DUOs is still high. By working in further detail on these DUO specimens, we hope to uncover previously undiagnosed pathogens, thus reducing the proportion of patients hospitalized with DUOs. A better understanding of regional pathogens causing infections should, eventually, lead to better diagnostic approaches, which ideally should be performed in a multiplex system in a timeframe that is relevant to patient care and cost-effective for use in developing country settings.",

Probably the greatest lesson learned has been in getting the various governmental and non-governmental organizations to work in unison. In Vietnam, like in many other countries, governmental and provincial departments supporting animal and human health largely work in administrative silos, with little overlap in their political direction or interests. The relationships that have been created between the independent government departments and academic research institutions will be key for the long-term sustainability of this network. However, as a consequence of zoonotic disease outbreaks occurring relatively infrequently, continual governmental funding for such a resource is often overlooked. Nevertheless, given our engagement with the various governmental departments and members of the Vietnamese public, we think that maintaining this infrastructure is both practical and financially viable. Through training schemes for laboratory workers, medical staff, community healthcare workers, and veterinarians, we are providing an ongoing capacity-building role and have provided support for several potential outbreaks and atypical clinical presentations in both the human and animal communities. Conversely, we believe that assessing the amount of zoonotic transfer and identifying pathogens likely to have an impact on human health will be the evidence required to persuade continued investment.",

This infrastructure will facilitate systematic investigations of pathogen ecology and evolution, enhance the understanding of viral cross-species transmission events, and allow us to identify the relevant risk factors and drivers of zoonotic disease emergence.
