In another report, the seroprevalence of HCoV-NL63 in 6\u201312-month-old children was 28.6\u201340.0% [35]. Maternally acquired antibodies were present in newborns and usually decreased within the first 4\u20135 months of life [34,35]. Three studies have calculated the incidence of HCoV-NL63 infections [5,19,36]. The design of these studies varied, however, and differences in the calculated incidences were reported. The comprehensive study by van der Hoek and colleagues [5] calculated the overall annual incidence in outpatients as seven per 1000 children per year, with the hospitalization rate estimated at 22 per 100,000 children; in contrast, a hospitalization rate of 224 per 100,000 (children younger than 6 years old) as previously reported [19].",

First, the suitability of the clinical samples examined: a recent study has demonstrated that there are differences between respiratory samples collected by nose/throat swabs, and those collected by nasopharyngeal aspiration, specifically regarding their usefulness in detecting and identifying respiratory pathogens [37]. The second problem is that diagnostic tests for HCoVs are not frequently used in the routine testing for respiratory viruses, which probably results in the percentage of HCoVs infections being greatly underestimated [38]. Lastly, over the years several molecular methods of variable sensitivity were used to determine the incidence of the virus [39\u201341]. Unless sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests are used for the detection of CoVs (including those infections with low viral load) as part of a respiratory virus surveillance strategy, the CoVs will always be underdiagnosed [42].",

Also, although a study from Thailand, with its tropical climate, showed year-to-year variation in prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infections, the virus was detected throughout the year [44]. A recent comprehensive 2-year population-based study, using data from different countries, on children under 3 years of age with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) shows that HCoV-NL63 infections peak in winter months. This study also shows large year-to-year differences in the frequency of HCoV-NL63 infections, with results indicating an interepidemic period of 2 years [5].",

Commonly, patients diagnosed with HCoV-NL63 infections of the upper respiratory tract present with mild symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat and rhinitis [18]. It is important to remember though, that the reports of symptoms in young children, who represent the majority of cases, are based mainly on parental observations, which often do not include possible subjective signs and symptoms. In addition, most studies are case reports of patients who have been hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections (and other milder symptoms are ignored in favor of treating the more severe ones) and studies are often limited by small sample sizes or short periods of assessment [36]. For these reasons the involvement of HCoV-NL63 in many other diseases could be overlooked.",

One of the most worrying clinical diagnoses of HCoV-NL63 infection is bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the membranes lining the bronchioles [22,24,25,30,45,48,49], and although a study of children hospitalized with fever and acute respiratory symptoms in China did not report an association of HCoV-NL63 with bronchiolitis [19], it still believed to be one of the presenting symptoms.",

The chance of developing croup is 6.6-times higher in HCoV-NL63-infected children than in HCoV-NL63-negative children [30]. Another study reports that HCoV-NL63, when compared with other respiratory viruses, is the virus second-most commonly associated with young children (median age 13 months) hospitalized with croup [17]. In fact, HCoV-NL63 appears to be more frequently associated with croup than HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 [7]. Previously, the etiological agent of croup was generally assumed to be one of the more well-known respiratory viruses, such as the parainfluenza viruses, but it is now clear that HCoV-NL63 also plays a major role in this disease [9].",

All subsequent reports, however, have conclusively demonstrated that no statistical significant link between HCoV-NL63 and Kawasaki disease exists [8,58\u201364].",

However, this is not unique to HCoV-NL63 infections, as coronavirus-like particles [21], as well as SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 RNA [68,69] have been previously detected in patient diarrheic samples. These manifestations appear to be a direct consequence of viral invasion of the intestinal mucosa [7]. In one study, 4 out of 878 stool samples from children with acute gastroenteritis tested positive for HCoV-NL63, and these samples are usually positive for other gastroenteritis viruses as well [70]. Another study using stool samples collected from 479 patients, reported the absence of HCoV-NL63 [71]. However, this study had several shortcomings, including a short study period, the absence of a control group without gastrointestinal disease, and specimen selection that might be biased towards individuals with more severe disease. Also, the majority of patients included were adults (older than 18 years of age); this is a problem since it has previously been shown that young children are more susceptible to HCoV-NL63 infections. Therefore, the findings of this study cannot exclude the role of HCoV-NL63 in gastrointestinal disease [71]. Thus far, data show that HCoV-NL63 may, at most, have a minor etiological role in acute gastroenteritis in children, but since other viruses are frequently associated with gastroenteritis in HCoV-NL63 infected individuals, the exact role of HCoV-NL63 is not clear.",

Interestingly, coinfected patients are more likely to be hospitalized, indicating the severity of this kind of superinfection [74]. In a study from Germany, respiratory syncytial virus A and HCoV-NL63 was the most common coinfection identified in children less than 3 years of age. This is probably due to the high incidence of respiratory syncytial virus A in winter and the overlap in the seasonality of the viruses [30]. Co-infection in hospitalized children with HCoV-NL63 and bocavirus is reported [75]. The viral load of HCoV-NL63 is lower in coinfected patients than in patients infected with HCoV-NL63 only [5,30]. The clinical significance of these coinfections are not clear, but various plausible explanations for the lower HCoV-NL63 viral load have previously been discussed: HCoV-NL63 causes the initial infection that weakens the immune system enough for a second viral infection to gain a foothold. By the time this second infection shows symptoms, the HCoV-NL63 infection might have already been brought under control by the host immune system; HCoV-NL63 and the other virus may be in competition for the same cellular receptor or target cell in the respiratory organs; the activation of the innate immune response triggered by the second respiratory virus may cause inhibition of HCoV-NL63; or prolonged persistence of HCoV-NL63 at low levels of expression [30,74]. Even though these reports may reflect biological complexity or interaction, it is important to keep in mind that virtually all the published studies comprise solely of cohorts of children hospitalized for ARTI and thus are extremely biased.",

However, the discovery of HCoV-NL63 and other novel HCoVs does not necessarily represent a sudden increase in emerging infections by \u2018new\u2019 CoVs. Of the CoVs isolated from patients in the 1960s, at least four were shown to be serologically distinct [77\u201379]. Unfortunately, these clinical samples were lost before they could be characterized and it will never be known whether these \u2018old\u2019 HCoVs and the current \u2018new\u2019 HCoVs represent the same strains [80]. HCoV-NL63 infections vary in frequency between years, but appear to peak during the winter months. HCoV-NL63 causes LRTIs and URTIs in 1.0\u20139.3% of children, the elderly and the immunocompromised, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Although unlikely, the high prevalence of coinfections of HCoV-NL63 and other respiratory viruses increases the chances of genetic recombination between these viruses in the host. In theory, these types of recombination events could enable highly pathogenic virus variants to arise [81]. Current data clearly show that HCoV-NL63 is clinically more important that previously suspected.",
