Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been proven to be the most effective antimicrobial agents against bacteria and viruses because of their high surface-area-to-volume ratio and unique chemical and physical properties, even though they have shown cytotoxicity at high concentrations [1,2,3]. Limited studies have found that Ag NPs show antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus [1,4,5,6], hepatitis B virus [7], herpes simplex virus type 1 [8], respiratory syncytial virus [9], monkey poxvirus [10], Tacaribe virus [11], and H1N1 influenza A virus [12,13,14]. All the RNA and DNA viruses mentioned previously contain lipid envelopes. No antiviral effects of Ag NPs on non-enveloped viruses have been investigated.",

            "text": "The major antiviral mechanism of Ag NPs has not been investigated extensively, but the most frequently observed method by which Ag NPs may inhibit viruses is the physical binding between the virus and Ag NPs to block the entry of the viruses into cells. Ag NPs could inhibit the in vitro production of HBV RNA and extracellular virions by interacting with the HBV viral particles, as revealed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) [7]. At an early stage of viral replication, Ag NPs are observed by TEM to bind to glycoprotein 120 and thus prevent the binding and fusion of HIV-1 and CD4 cells. In addition, Ag NPs can inhibit the post-entry stages of the HIV-1 life cycle [5]. Because Ag NPs have a natural tendency to bind the disulfide bonds in each monomer of hemagglutinin protein on the surface of an influenza virus and block its host receptor binding sites, Ag NPs can inhibit the absorption of influenza viruses to Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and chicken red blood cells [12]. Numerous factors can determine the antiviral efficacy of Ag NPs, including size, shape, and capping agents. Previous studies have found that the most effective size of Ag NPs is <10 nm [14] and that a spherical shape is superior to a tubular shape or aggregation. Furthermore, previous studies have revealed that capping agents limiting the release of free Ag NPs would exhibit lower viral inhibition [5]. Therefore, novel material for the capping and support agents of Ag NPs is required for a superior application of Ag NPs.",

            "text": "Graphene, a single atomic plane of graphine with 2-dimensional extension, is promising as a next-generation nanomaterial due to its unique high carrier mobility, effective optical transparency, large surface area, and biocompatibility [15]. GO is employed in the production of graphene family nanomaterials for various applications. The antibacterial activity of well-dispersed GO sheets has been evaluated [16,17,18], and a few studies have reported that graphene-based material can inhibit the entry and replication of enveloped DNA virus (herpesvirus) and RNA virus (coronavirus) in their target cells [19,20]. The pertinent findings of previous studies on the nanocomposites formed by Ag NPs and GO sheets against bacteria can be applied to investigations of the antiviral activity of nanocomposites composed of GO sheets and Ag NPs (GO-Ag). The GO sheets can serve as a supporting and stabilizing agent in preventing the agglomeration of the Ag NPs and consequently in preventing a reduction of the antibacterial activity. The Ag NPs supported on GO sheets showed a spherical-like morphology and an average size of 7.5 nm [16], which is suitable for antiviral activity [14]. The most significant advantage of GO-Ag nanocomposites over free Ag NPs is that the immobilization of Ag NPs on GO sheets prevents the movement of the nanoparticles, thus increasing the material\u2019s biocompatibility and reducing the toxicological effects and the environmental impact associated with metallic nanoparticles. In addition, the GO-Ag matrix is highly dispersible in water, contains a large specific surface area, shows excellent bactericidal activity at extremely low concentrations, and exhibits no corrosive characteristics.",

Crystalline of GO and chemical composition were carried out via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan, XRD-6000, Cu-K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 0.154 nm) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, K-Alpha). The thickness and layer number of GO were scanned and analyzed with an atomic force microscope (AFM, Minus K Technology, Inglewood, CA, USA, P100). The sample was dissolved in ethanol, spread on silicon wafer, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 \u00b0C for AFM. A thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA, Pyris 1 TGA) was used to calculate the loading (wt %) of Ag nanoparticles on GO sheets. The TGA analysis was executed under an air atmosphere and GO-Ag was heated at the rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The carbon and oxygen of the GO-Ag were released in the forms of CO2 and water after heating, and the remaining weight of Ag could be used to calculate the loading (weight %) of Ag particles in 1 g of GO sheet.",

Ag NPs have shown antiviral activity against enveloped viruses in previous studies, but no studies have discussed the antiviral activity of GO and GO-Ag. The antiviral mechanisms of Ag NPs are mainly based on the blocking of viral entry and the interference with viral membrane fusion [12,14]. The antiviral activity of GO-Ag observed in the current study should be contributed to by Ag particles on GO sheets. The sizes of Ag particles on GO sheets shown by FE-SEM images ranged from 5 to 25 nm, and about 50% of Ag particles were 10 nm or fewer than 10 nm. Less inhibition ability (25%) of GO-Ag (1 mg/mL) against coronavirus (47,000 TCID50/mL) was observed, compared to 97% of inhibition against influenza virus (100 TCID50/mL) by Ag NPs (0.05 mg/mL) [14]. However, the virus inhibition ability of Ag NPs in Xiang\u2019s study [14] is not much better than that of GO-Ag in this study if we calculate the differences of virus and compound concentrations. Since GO sheets also showed antiviral ability against the coronavirus in this study, the synergistic effect from GO sheets and Ag particles on the inhibition against the infection of an enveloped virus should be considered.",

Exposure to GO and reduced GO can induce significant production of reactive oxygen species in Pseudomonas and lead to the fragmentation of bacterial DNA and death [17]. GO-Ag can disrupt the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria and inhibit cell division of Gram-negative bacteria [26]. From de Faria\u2019s study, GO sheets showed no antibacterial activity, while GO-Ag had a 100% inhibition rate of the adhered cells, thus preventing the process of biofilm formation [16]. Because of the differences of antiviral activity against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses by GO sheets, it is reasonable to assume that there is a physical or chemical interaction between GO sheets and the envelope of coronavirus leading to decreased infectivity. Without an envelope, the antiviral activity would solely rely on Ag particles, but GO sheets can boost the antiviral effect of Ag particles by supporting the even dispersion of Ag particles and the formation of spherical particles without aggregations. Additionally, the immobilization of Ag NPs on GO sheets has reduced cytotoxicity, usually caused by free Ag NPs.",

For non-enveloped viruses, graphene oxide (GO) sheets act as supporting materials for antiviral Ag particles without any antiviral ability. For the enveloped virus, GO sheets not only can be used to assist the even dispersal of Ag particles but also have ability to inhibit the infection of viruses. GO sheets also show very low cytotoxicity to cells. In conclusion, this study discovered that GO and GO-Ag are novel materials for the further development of protective reagents and equipment against the transmission of infectious viruses.",

In consideration of strict regulation of BSL-3 pathogens and the dangers of handling, we chose feline coronavirus (FCoV) for the enveloped virus and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) for the non-enveloped virus, because no zoonotic transmission by them has ever been reported. The protective effect of masks such as N95 and three-layer surgical masks is only maintained when the surface layer of the mask is hydrophobic and dry. The protective effect of the N95 facemask was reduced significantly when the mask was moistened by accidental splashes of blood or body fluids from patients, or by sweat and respiratory droplets from the wearers. If the mask surface is contaminated with infectious agents, microorganisms may be able to penetrate the protective layers along with the droplets [27]. Novel GO-Ag antiviral nanomaterial coating in the facemasks should minimize the risk of transmission of infectious agents.",

Although the antiviral mechanism requires further research, the unique structure of graphene oxide sheets could contribute to the inhibition of infection by feline coronavirus with a lipid envelope. To inhibit the infection of infectious bursal disease virus without a lipid envelope, the conjugation between the sulfur groups of viral proteins and the silver particles on the surface of graphene oxide could be important. Studies on the interactions between GO and lipid membranes showed that negatively charged GO can absorb to positively charged lipid membranes and induce the rupture of lipid membranes [28]. The lipid tails exposed from the ruptured lipid membrane would associate strongly to the aromatic plane of the GO sheet [29]. The interactions between GO and lipid membrane can attract the absorption of more lipid membranes [28]. Therefore, a tentative model was proposed for the antiviral mechanisms of GO and GO-Ag against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses (Figure 7).",
