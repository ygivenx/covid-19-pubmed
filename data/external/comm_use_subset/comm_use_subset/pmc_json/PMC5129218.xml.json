            "text": "Lower airway troubles and especially inflammatory airway disease (IAD) represent one of the main causes of poor-performance for racehorses [1]. This syndrome, which may affect horses of any age, is clinically characterised by chronic occasional coughing with normal breathing at rest [2, 3]. Diagnostic confirmation requires the documentation of either excess tracheobronchial mucus or abnormal profiles on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology [4]. One of the exclusion criteria for IAD is the evidence of systemic signs of infection [3, 4]. Among various extrinsic risk-factors, increased proportions of bacteria (mainly Streptococcus zooepidemicus and Actinobacillus/Pasteurella spp.) isolated from tracheal wash (TW) have repeatedly been associated with clinical signs of IAD in both young and older Thoroughbred racehorses [5, 6].",

Positive PCR for EHV-2 in nasal swabs, but not in BALF, was also significantly associated with diagnosis of IAD in a recent case-control study [13]. Conversely, clinical signs of respiratory disease were not associated with either the presence or the level of shedding of EHV-2 in nasal swabs [12]. To date, the use of quantitative PCR on respiratory samples in relation to IAD has been described for a very limited number of viruses only [12]. Furthermore, no epidemiological data on viral loads from tracheal samples are currently available, while previously found to be potentially relevant in experimental conditions [7, 8].",

Similarly, identification and quantification have also been performed only on samples with up to 3 different strains.

This unexpected finding suggests that high counts of commensal bacteria in the trachea of athletic horses might opportunistically become pathogenic, along with other viral or environmental challenges. Conversely, coughing has been associated with TW isolation of Streptococcus zooepidemicus or Pasteurellaceae spp. in a previous case-control study [9]; the odds of airway inflammation being also significantly increased along with CFU/ml [5, 6, 24].",

Despite a moderately lower monthly incidence, both EHV-2 and EHV-5 have been detected on at least one occasion for all 52 horses of the study. Due to their capability of viral latency, it might then be determined that each of these horses was a permanent carrier for both EHV-2 and EHV-5. Previously published data also revealed that multiple strains of EHV-2 might be concomitantly detected in nasal swabs or TW of a single horse [7, 26]. However, no phylogeny has been performed for further characterising the strains detected among time in the present study.",

These data confirm previous cytological findings from experimentally induced EHV-2 reactivation [7]; and are also coherent with a recent case-control study in which nasal shedding of EHV-2 was significantly associated with diagnosis of IAD [13]. Based on the growing evidence of its implication in lower airway inflammation; elucidating the underlying EHV-2 pathogenesis warrants further investigation. On the other hand, EHV-5 detection, quantification or viral loads in either NS or TW have not been associated with coughing, nasal discharge nor airway inflammation in this study. Such observation might however not be surprising, since EHV-5 has repeatedly been detected in asymptomatic horses [25, 27]. Alternatively, the clinical signs frequently reported for equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis, an EHV-5 associated chronic disease, include intermittent fever, weight loss and respiratory distress [28].",

The prevalence of ERBV RNA quantification presently found in NS was slightly higher than previous data [12], which might be partially explained by the differences in sampling methodologies (nasal vs. nasopharyngeal swabs) and qPCR assays. Conversely, the monthly incidence of \u2018quantifiable\u2019 samples for ERBV was comparable to previously reported serological results, based on complement fixation tests [11]. It has however been recently found that detection of ERBV RNA by PCR in nasal swabs might not coincide with seroconversion [14]. Besides, the low prevalence of ERAV RNA detection in NS or TW was somehow unexpected, since being previously associated with acute clinical cases of respiratory diseases [29]. In addition, a high seroprevalence has been previously described worldwide for this virus [30] and vaccination is currently not available in Europe.",

Interestingly, neither agreement nor correlation has been found between paired samples (NS and TW), for genome detection or viral loads of any investigated virus. In terms of subclinical infectious diseases, findings from upper airways (NS) cannot be considered as representative of lower airways (TW) in the same horse. Moreover, viral genome detection in NS seems not to be relevant in the clinical context of IAD, unlike acute infectious airway troubles [22, 29]. It might then be recommended to perform qPCR in TW samples for any virus detection on horses at training, as previously suggested for a limited number of herpesviruses [31].",

The demonstration of increased antibody titres however requires two consecutive samplings with a 3 to 4-week interval, which is irrelevant on the field for any concomitant diagnosis of IAD. Apart from viruses and bacteria, non-infectious agents are also likely to be relevant to the development of IAD in horses [4]. Another limitation would then be the absence of environmental investigations within the different training yards throughout the study. Ultra-fine particles (< 10 \u03bcm) within the breathing zone of the horse were indeed recently found to be significant risk-factors for excess mucus and increased TW neutrophil proportions [32].",
