Kudu rabies was not known before the mid - 1970s. Until this point in time only sporadic but endemic rabies was reported throughout most of Namibia mainly in dogs, livestock and wildlife, though geographically separated2\u20135. In 1975, the first cases of rabid Kudus were detected in central Namibia near Windhoek. From here, the disease spread northwards to all major habitats of Kudus in the country, including the Etosha National Park6,7, though this assumption may be biased by enhanced awareness and surveillance. During this first epidemic event, however, that lasted from 1977 to 1986 an estimated 50,000 Kudus, approximately 20% of the total population, had succumbed to rabies. In the following years only isolated sporadic outbreaks in Kudus were reported. This changed in 2002, when another sharp increase in Kudu rabies cases was recorded8. Today, rabies in Kudus is endemic affecting a large portion of both the Kudu population and habitat in Namibia9.",

            "text": "Kudu herds typically consist of 1 to 3 females with their offspring. However, herds may temporarily merge forming groups of up to 30 animals. Males form transient bachelor groups that can include mature bulls after the main mating season14. One of the most commonly observed symptoms of a rabies infection in Kudus is hyper-salivation12. Because the animals often browse simultaneously from the same shrub or tree and have close contact with each other through activities such as mutual social licking, they could potentially come into contact with saliva containing rabies virus from an infected animal within the group. The assumption of horizontal transmission was further supported by early transmission experiments demonstrating that Kudus could become infected when infectious saliva was administered by the oral route12. Also, based on several unique mutations complete genome sequencing revealed rabies virus (RABV) isolates from Kudus to be distinct from those of dogs, but also from other terrestrial carnivores, like jackals, in Namibia further supporting the assumption that rabies is being maintained independently in the Namibian Kudu population15. Although anecdotal evidence apparently supports the hypothesis of horizontal rabies transmission among Kudus, it still remains a mystery whether this mode of transmission can really explain the recent outbreaks and apparent rapid spread of the disease over large territories.",

            "text": "Kudu rabies is a scourge for game farmers as the Namibian economy relies extensively on Kudu through the means of trophy hunting, game meat hunting and eco-tourism1,8,16. This browser is the second-largest antelope; bulls can weigh up to 315 kg14. Besides occurring naturally over much of eastern and southern Africa, Kudus are utilized in a number of ways such as (i) capture and sale of live animals for breeding purposes, (ii) trophy hunting and (iii) hunting for venison. To this end, Kudus are kept in fully fenced game farms, fenced commercial livestock/game farms, where livestock (usually cattle or small ruminants) and Kudus roam together and in enclosures (>2000 ha) on many game farms across southern Africa, in particular Namibia. Kudus have the third largest asset value of all farmed animals in Namibia. In 2004, the estimated value of Kudus was 31.13 million US dollars, which was greater than the total value of sheep, goats and donkeys combined1. Pre-exposure vaccination of Kudus against rabies seems a justified approach considering their economic value and observed high rabies-associated mortality. However, herding these animals by helicopter or vehicle into a holding facility for vaccination by intramuscular injection is extremely costly, labor intensive and a dangerous operation (stress induced injuries and/or mortality). Vaccination of free-living Kudus through darting from a vehicle has been proven over many years to be virtually impossible due to animals fleeing or going into hiding when vehicles and humans are observed. Hence, presently the only available option is vaccination by darting from a helicopter but this is very difficult, expensive and time consuming. In addition, Kudus have the habit of taking shelter under trees when they perceive an unknown noise such as a helicopter. The observation of artificial transmissibility of RABV by the oral route under experimental conditions12 led to the suggestion that if animals could become infected by the oral route, this route may also be feasible for vaccination purposes as was shown initially for the North American subspecies of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes fulva)17. Oral rabies vaccination of foxes and other mesocarnivores acting as reservoir species has been developed into the method of choice for rabies control in these species18.",

Also, a sliding door could be used to connect the pen with an adjacent pen for separating single animals. The height of the indoor part of the pen was 3 m and the outdoor section was surrounded by a 3 m high wall. Large doors opening in both directions connect the pens with the central passage. Overhead catwalks enabled the staff to observe animals and facilitated the separation and manipulation of animals, e.g. immobilization for vaccination, infection and blood sampling. For the purposes of this study, to prevent contact with free-roaming wildlife from adjacent areas, the entire experimental holding facility and surrounding area was secured by a single 3.2 m high wire mesh game proofed fence (Fig. 2). Furthermore, no other animals were held in the experimental facility during the entire study period. The site was guarded 24 h per day.",

VNA titres were calculated using inverse interpolation as described and expressed in international units (IU/mL)28. Presence of rabies specific binding antibodies were tested using a commercial blocking ELISA (BioPro Rabies ELISA, Czech Republic) strictly following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A study evaluating this ELISA kit found 100% specificity and 95.5% sensitivity with fox and raccoon dog sera; and 95% concordance with an assay measuring VNAs (the Fluorescent Antibody Neutralization Test)29. None of the serological assays employed in this study have been fully evaluated with Kudu sera, and a previous publication has demonstrated variable cut-off levels per species27. To account for lack of a unique identifiable cut-off in the assays for Kudu sera, besides sero-positive and sero-negative results indeterminate values were considered within a range of variation around the presumed cut-off of positivity (0.5 IU/mL +/\u2212 0.25 IU/mL for RFFIT and 40% + 4.41%/\u22125.28% for BioPro ELISA) as described previously27. As a versatile and practical method for measuring rabies specific antibodies p.v., additionally the RAPINA test30 was applied as a 3rd method by following instructions of the manufacturer. Final scoring if a serum sample was deemed antibody negative or positive was based on a weighted analysis of all results obtained by the 3 different assays without giving an absolute value to it. ELISA and RFFIT results were given more weight (++; \u2212\u2212; ++/\u2212\u2212) than the RAPINA test (+, \u2212, +/\u2212), for the latter is not considered a standard test for rabies serology yet; whereby ++ or + is sero-positive, \u2212\u2212 or \u2212 is sero-negative and +/\u2212 or ++/\u2212\u2212 indeterminate.

The high population density as a result of game farming is thought to favor rabies epidemics among this species.

Also, the lack of suitable research facilities able to house these large antelopes under quarantine conditions restricted this study to a relatively remote holding site that is normally used for temporary housing of wild game for sale and auctioning, hence complicating observations, sampling, sampling storage and \u2013 transportation.

In addition, the outcome of the transmission studies showed that depending on the viral dose Kudus are able to survive an infection with RABV and hence, confirm previous observations12. The animal (K21) that survived infection never showed clinical signs, indicating that the virus was recognized and cleared by the immune system either prior to movement into peripheral nerves or prior to infection of the central nervous system.

However, despite anecdotal evidence of horizontal rabies transmission among Kudus, to this day this hypothesis has still not been definitively confirmed in a larger experimental setting. The hypothesis is based on the observation of hypersalivation and high viral titres in saliva of rabid Kudus, their grooming habits and in particular experimental studies11,12. Although artificial exposure to infection showed that 2 out of 4 Kudus died of rabies after experimental infection by instillation of infected saliva onto their buccal mucosae, intranasal (i.n.) infection cannot be excluded to have provoked the disease because the saliva was also instilled into the nasal cavity at the same time12. In fact, i.n. administration is a very effective way of delivering RABV directly to the brain via the olfactory nerve38,39. Our study seems to corroborate the possibility of horizontal transmission as the virus isolated from the contact animal possessed the unique marker of the challenge strain used. Since the length of the stop signals and intergenic regions affect polymerase termination and downstream re-initiation40 potential effects of this three nt insertion in the intergenic region between P and M gene on virus replication cannot be excluded. However, since selection of the additional insertion in the course of limited cell culture passages is more likely to support virus replication and the glycoprotein has been identified as the major pathogenicity factor41, major effects on the virulence of the challenge virus are unlikely.",

(Tables 2, S2) could be considered evidence for exposure with infectious saliva from inoculated Kudus which succumbed to the disease. Unfortunately, the relationship between dose and strength of priming using street RABVs is not well characterized in both bats and other wildlife42. Although our experimental settings allowed natural social and feeding behavior to the greatest possible extent, Kudus had to be humanely euthanized early after showing clinical signs. This may have limited the likelihood of successful onward transmission leading to horizontally acquired rabies. The fact that only one of 12 contact animals (K05) died of rabies needs careful interpretation. If our observations resemble naturally occurring infections it would suggests that the extent of horizontal transmission under field conditions is less than is actually believed. Even if the transmission rate was underestimated and acquired seropositivity of contact animals (K04, K08, K10) (Tables 2, S2) was also considered as evidence of transmission, the latter being highly debatable, local horizontal transmission cannot plausibly explain the recent epidemics and rapid spread of the disease in Kudus over large territories. In this sense, long incubation periods might add to the situation explaining why rabies in Kudu is resurgent after months in areas where it is believed to have disappeared. Interestingly, high number of cattle rabies cases and other small ruminants in areas where Kudu rabies is endemic (unpublished) also bring into question the role of the Kudu as a sole reservoir. While the phylogenetic work of Scott and co-workers15 seem to support evidence for independent horizontal transmission among Kudus, this is contradicted by an earlier study which suggest that jackal and Kudu may form part of the same epidemiological cycle of rabies in Namibian wildlife43. From an epidemiological point of view, a combination of spill-over events and perhaps locally restricted horizontal transmission cannot be excluded, however, has not been considered or discussed thus far. Also, other epidemiological aspects including management, translocation, natural movement behavior and other parameters would definitely need a more thorough investigation and consideration to unravel the mystery of Kudu rabies in Namibia.",

            "text": "Expanding the concept of oral vaccination against rabies as successfully developed for wild carnivores to Kudus seems to be a feasible approach considering that commercial products for oral immunization of ruminants already exist; e.g. for immunization of calves in controlling diarrhea caused by bovine rotavirus and \u2013 coronavirus (Calf-Guard\u00ae, Zoetis). However, mucosal immunization through oral delivery is often compromised by antigen degradation in the stomach, especially considering the complex gastro-intestinal tracts of larger ruminants44. Therefore, to assure antigen uptake at Peyer\u2019s patches of the intestine additional substances are often added to oral vaccine formulations protecting the antigen against enzymatic and proteolytic degradation. However, the gut is not the only site with mucous-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) containing lymphoid follicles and M-cells. MALT can also be found in nasal and oral cavities, whereby tonsils form a major component in the latter. Recent studies have indicated that for oral vaccination of meso-carnivores against rabies the palatine tonsils are a major site of vaccine uptake45\u201347. Palatine tonsils are also present in ruminants like cattle, sheep and goats48. Experimental studies in wild ruminants like white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) showed that DOA of BCG-vaccine targeting the pharyngeal lymphoid tissue was able to induce an immune response against bovine tuberculosis49. Also, oral administration of heat-inactivated Mycobacterium bovis to red deer (Cervus elaphus) induced some level of protection against bovine tuberculosis50. In our proof-of-principle experiment, 3 of 10 animals orally vaccinated with SPBN GSAGAS survived a severe rabies challenge infection with a high challenge dose (Table 1, Fig. 4). Even though no statistical significance in survival between unvaccinated and DOA vaccinated animals was found, the survival of Kudu suggest that oral vaccination may elicit a protective immune response in this species.",

It must be mentioned that the vaccine virus was evenly distributed in the oral cavity of the Kudus using a needleless syringe simulating release of vaccine when chewing on a vaccine sachet and the palatine tonsillar crypts as potential uptake site were not specifically targeted. However, unfortunate spillage of vaccine virus could not be prevented as most of the anesthetics including thiafentanil oxalate induce salivation in wild herbivores and in combination with grinding often produce frothing around the mouth51. So this per se makes DOA in these species difficult. On the other hand, one can argue that 30% survival in orally vaccinated Kudus (Table 1, Fig. 4) after challenge does not appear very convincing. However, it is the first time that such a proof-of-concept study has ever been conducted in an herbivorous species such as Kudus. The vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS has shown to be efficacious in several animal species like red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), raccoon (Procyon lotor) and small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus)19,52,53. However, striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) seem to be rather refractory to vaccination through the oral route in a vaccine virus titer dependent manner47.

Therefore, we modified the thresholds of positivity by introducing an additional \u2018grey zone\u2019 for inconclusive or indeterminate results based on analysis by Moore et al.27. The subsequent weighted scoring allowed a clear identification of sera as being seropositive and negative without giving an absolute value to it and by avoiding classifying sera as indeterminate.

            "text": "Using this approach, only the results obtained p.v. with the animals vaccinated by the parenteral route showed a perfect correlation between seroconversion and protection for both serologic assays. However, for the animals that received the vaccine by the oral route, the serology results are more difficult to interpret (Tables 3, S2, Fig. 5) (see above). While 3 DOA vaccinated but seronegative animals survived challenge, two Kudus with supposedly acquired or preexisting antibodies at the day of challenge (K35, K36) succumbed to infection indicating a non-protective immunity (Tables 3, S3). Perhaps, the measured humoral antibody response prior to challenge is not of sufficient specificity or not associated with cellular immunity to prevent a lethal infection. The results of this study somewhat corroborate results obtained in studies on rabies repeated challenge in bats42 and suggest that a single exposure may not protect Kudus significantly against subsequent infections. These findings also underscore that diagnostic assays validated (specificity and sensitivity) for samples from certain species are not automatically suitable for samples from other species, as was recently shown for serology by Moore et al.27.",

In any case, further studies need to be initiated to optimize oral vaccine uptake and delivery of this 3rd generation attenuated oral rabies vaccine. Alternatively, recombinant rabies virus vaccines expressing the RABV glycoprotein could also be considered in future studies57. For the time being the minimum effective titer of both attenuated and recombinant vaccine viruses required to efficiently immunize the animals is not known yet. Hence, further research should investigate how vaccine uptake effectiveness can be improved, for example by increasing vaccine titre, vaccination intervals or adding muco-adhesive substances. Attractive baits for oral vaccination of Kudus have been developed already58, however, bait delivery systems need to be optimized in case vaccine potency can be enhanced in this species. Also, validation of serological assays for Kudus is required to make better informed decisions on the immune status.",
