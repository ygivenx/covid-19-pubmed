            "text": "Enterovirus type 71 (EV71) is the causative agent of several human diseases, including hand-foot-and-mouth disease, encephalitis, and meningitis. EV71 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, which belongs to the Picornaviridae family [1]. Genomic RNA of picornaviruses (e.g. polioviruses) encodes a polyprotein precursor, which is processed by three proteases (the maturation protease, 2A protease, and the 3C protease) into at least 11 different proteins, which are arranged in the order of NH2-VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-VPg-3C-3D-COOH [1]. The 2A protease of poliovirus, a representative member of the Picornaviridae, is a cysteine protease with multiple functions [2]. Similar to poliovirus 2A protease, expression of EV71 2A protease led to cleavage of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI, a key factor for host protein synthesis [3,4]. Moreover, transient expression of EV71 2A protease alone also resulted in the induction of apoptotic change [5,6]. However, the function of EV71 2A protease is not well characterized. The biologic function of EV71 2A protease was investigated by fusing it with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and examining its possible interaction with cellular factors [7].",

Thus, EV71 2A protease with 150 amino acids could passively disuse into the nucleus. Confocal microscopy analysis was used to examine the sub-cellular localization of EV71 2A protein. The expression plasmid encoding the C-terminus of VP1 protein, full-length 2A protease and V5 tag was constructed and transfected into HeLa cells before confocal microscopy analysis. The same approach was used to construct and transfect the DNA fragment encoding full-length 2A protease with mutation of amino acid 110 from Cys to Ala. Protein expression of these constructs was demonstrated using Western blot analysis (Figure 4A). Both the wild-type and mutant EV71 2A proteins localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 4B). Amino acids 31 to 42 of EV71 2A protein (Figure 2A) were identified as a potential nuclear export signal (NES) http://tw.expasy.org/index.html. However, similar to full-length EV71 2A protease, this protein without amino acids 31 to 42 localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus but not in the nucleus only (Figure 4B).",

            "text": "In addition to EV71 2A protease (Figure 1), Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease is also a transcription activator (Figure 6). Interestingly, there is an acidic domain in the C-terminus of this protein (6 amino acids within the last 15 amino acids are acidic, Table 2). The 2A proteases of other members of the Enterovirus genus, such as Coxsackie viruses and polioviruses, also contain an acidic domain in the C-terminus (Table 2). On the other hand, there is no such an acidic domain in the C-terminus of 2A proteases of rhinoviruses (2 or 3 amino acids within the last 15 amino acids are acidic, Table 2) or cardiovirus (3 amino acids within the last 15 amino acids are acidic, Table 2). These observations suggest that 2A proteases of enteroviruses but not other distinctly related picornaviruses (e.g. rhinoviruses, cardioviruses) possess transcriptional activity. Interestingly, a previous report demonstrated that this acidic region of poliovirus 2Apro is critical for viral RNA replication but not for cis- or trans- proteolytic cleavage [14]. Our results also demonstrated that EV71 2A protease without amino acids 146-149 still retained its protease activity (Figure 5A) but lost its transcriptional activity (Figure 5B). Thus, enteroviral 2A proteases may transactivate some cellular genes to benefit virus replication. Some cellular genes, e.g. PCBP2, PTBP1, RTN3, GBF1, CD55, and SAM68 gene, were reported to enhance the replication of poliovirus or EV71. However, EV71 2A protease suppressed rather than increased the transcription of these cellular genes (data not shown). These results were consistent with several reports regarding the shut-off of host cell mRNA synthesis caused by EV71 3C protein [32,33]. If enteroviral 2A proteases could in deed transactivate some cellular genes to benefit virus replication, further investigations are needed to determine its cellular target(s) and DNA-binding activity. Alternatively, EV71 2A protease may only help its own viral RNA synthesis in cytoplasm, whose mechanism is similar to the cellular transcription, rather than transactivate cellular genes to benefit virus replication. Further studies are needed to elucidate the function of this protein.",
