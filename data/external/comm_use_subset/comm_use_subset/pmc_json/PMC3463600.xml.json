First, unlike earlier studies, large-scale surveys enable researchers to derive and incorporate more accurate parameters into their models [8]\u2013[9]. Earlier modeling of disease infections, for example, estimated that an average person had contact with either 10 or 20 people at work in a typical day. The estimated number of contacts at school ranged widely from 20, 79, 128 to 155 [10]\u2013[12]. Whether based on simulations or small samples of interviews, such estimates may not reflect overall contact patterns in the whole population.

The results brought by the new parameters also show noticeable differences from similar modeling based on data from the United States. Given the nature of disease infections, the simple diary-based approach shall continue to be the most comprehensive method to collect details about face-to-face interpersonal contacts in everyday life. The difficulties of data collection may be eased by the use of more technically advanced methods, such as online surveys. Nonetheless, because such surveys tend to undersample technically disadvantaged groups (who may also be more or less vulnerable to disease infections), one should pay special attention to the validity of statistical inferences based on data collected from the use of such methods. More country-specific findings are expected as an increasing amount of comparable diary-based probability survey data becomes available from other countries. For example, preliminary analyses show that the Taiwanese have a different cross-generational pattern of interpersonal contact. While European diary-based studies reveal frequent interactions between children and adults about 30\u201340 years apart [1]\u2013[4], Taiwan diaries show additional and noticeable interactions between age cohorts that are about 60 years apart.",

It is not uncommon in Taiwan for people from three generations to live under the same roof, or for grandparents to help take care of their young grandchildren on a daily basis. In such a circumstance, both care givers (seniors) and care takers (toddlers or young children) may well belong to the age groups that are also most susceptible to influenza infections. Does this special feature of age composition within the household contribute to any divergent cross-cultural patterns of disease infections? When contact patterns in everyday life are subject to such cultural norms, policy makers should make the best use of diary-generated empirical data and design intervention strategies accordingly.",
