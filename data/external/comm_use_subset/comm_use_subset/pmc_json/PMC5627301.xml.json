            "text": "Influenza virus infection remains a serious threat to global health and the world economy. Annual influenza epidemics result in a large number of hospitalizations, with an estimated 3\u20135 million cases of severe disease and approximately 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths globally (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en), with much higher mortality rates possible during pandemics. Despite substantial innovations in treatment and prevention of influenza, licensed antiviral drugs and vaccines do not eliminate the risk of infection. Prompt treatment with therapeutic antiviral neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors can lower influenza morbidity, but these drugs have a limited therapeutic window and are subject to sporadic resistance.1\u20133 Active antiviral immunization with prophylactic influenza vaccines has remarkably lowered seasonal influenza morbidity and mortality at the population level. However, at-risk groups such as infants, the elderly, and otherwise immune-compromised individuals lack optimal adaptive immune responses following vaccination. Furthermore, to counteract the high rate of influenza virus antigenic drift, seasonal vaccines must be re-formulated and re-administered annually at great cost with significant time constraints. Emerging strains of influenza arising from antigenic shift (re-assortment) and cross-species transmission to humans also pose a considerable pandemic threat.4 The limited capacity to develop a new vaccine to meet the immediacy and high demand accompanying a pandemic outbreak highlights the global need for new, broad, cost-effective intervention strategies against influenza.5\n",

While great strides in antibody delivery are being made, the expense of bioprocessed monoclonal antibodies, as well as current requirements for frequent administration, likely pose limitations for universal adoption of this approach and dissemination to global populations. Alternative delivery technologies which co-opt aspects traditionally associated with immunization, such as viral vectored gene therapy, have shown some promise in delivering anti-influenza antibodies in mice,11, 12 but permanence concerns and pre-existing anti-vector serology may limit utility of repeatedly using these viral vectors in humans.",

Delivery of FluA DMAb and FluB DMAb results in robust in vivo expression of functional antibodies which protect mice against lethal challenge. We show for the first time that FluA and FluB DMAbs are functionally equivalent to their corresponding protein monoclonal antibodies purified from in vitro cell production. These DMAb impart simultaneous prophylactic cross-protection against diverse strains of influenza A and influenza B virus when given in combination. Furthermore, FluA DMAb and FluB DMAb afford immediate protection without inhibiting host antiviral immunity. The DMAb anti-influenza technology provides a unique alternative strategy to seasonal vaccination, bioprocessed recombinant protein monoclonal antibodies or gene therapy approaches for universal prevention of severe influenza infection.

This antibody binds to a conserved region in the globular head of influenza B HA, and can inhibit viral hemagglutination of red blood cells. To test the utility of DMAb delivery to prevent severe influenza infection, a synthetic DNA transgene encoding either human IgG FluA or FluB was synthesized de novo, and cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid. Multiple modifications were made to enhance DMAb expression including DNA codon optimization, RNA optimization, and formulation of plasmid DNA (Supplemental Fig. S1), as well as plasmid vector design, incorporation of leader sequences for processing and secretion, and CELLECTRA\u00ae electroporation techniques.16, 17 Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of human IgG in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells transfected with either FluA DMAb or FluB DMAb synthetic constructs confirmed intracellular expression and extracellular secretion of FluA and FluB antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1a). Human IgG Western blot also demonstrated antibody heavy-chain and light-chain expression in transfected 293 T cells (Fig. 1b).\n",

Yet given the expense of administering biologics, and their limited half-life, only one protein monoclonal antibody has been approved and is routinely used for prophylaxis against an infectious disease target (palivizumab, RSV).23 DMAb technology is a notable delivery alternative as DMAb produced from muscle cells in vivo and purified monoclonal antibodies manufactured in vitro confer similar levels of protection against lethal influenza infection in mice. Plasmid DNA lacks limitations posed by pre-existing anti-vector serology and the DMAb platform may be utilized repeatedly to deliver additional anti-influenza antibodies to combat viral escape, or antibodies aimed at entirely different pathogens.16, 17 Plasmid DNA also has little risk of genomic integration (reviewed in ref. 24) and similar plasmid designs have demonstrated safety in DNA vaccine human clinical studies.25\n",

            "text": "DNA plasmid-based delivery of monoclonal antibodies provides conceptual advantages at each step of the supply chain. In production, DMAb are inexpensive relative to protein monoclonal antibody (and viral vectors) because DNA replication does not require mammalian cell culture. DNA is simple to scale up and stable for storage, a particularly important consideration in resource-limited settings. The potential for long-term DMAb expression with sustainable passive immune protection against influenza infection may circumvent the need for frequent recombinant antibody injections. Long-term expression of DMAb can be further augmented by emerging antibody half-life extension technologies.26 Conceivably, inoculation with influenza-specific DMAbs may have utility to augment a vaccine campaign, generating almost immediate prophylaxis against severe influenza infection while allowing for an adequate vaccine-induced immune response to mature. DMAbs may also provide a vital option for severely immune impaired individuals incapable of mounting functional active immune responses. DMAb technology is an exceptionally compelling tool warranting further exploration for sustained protection against severe infection by diverse strains influenza A and B viruses, as well as further investigation against infectious diseases more generally.",

Variable gene sequences were isolated from cross-reactive clones by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and further modified to revert nonessential non-germline framework amino acid changes. Full-length human IgG1\u03ba were transiently expressed in CHO cells and purified for use in in vivo studies. Plasmid DMAb constructs were engineered as previously described.16, 17 DMAb constructs encoded fully human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibodies FluA DMAb and FluB DMAb. Antibody amino acid sequences were DNA codon-optimized and RNA-optimized for expression in human/mouse, and resulting DNA transgenes were synthesized de novo (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). These synthetic transgenes were restriction-cloned into a modified pVax1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) under the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. IgE heavy-chain and light-chain leader sequences were added for cellular processing and secretion. In initial studies (Figs. 1\u20134), transgenes consisted of antibody heavy-chain and light-chain sequences separated by a furin/picornavirus-2A peptide cleavage site sequence, yielding expression of heavy-chain and light-chain peptides from a single plasmid. In later studies with co-administration of FluA and FluB DMAb (Fig. 5), two FluA DMAb constructs individually expressing heavy-chain or light-chain FluA peptides were mixed for expression of heavy-chain and light-chain FluA peptides from separate plasmids.",

One day prior to infection, protein IgG monoclonal antibody with amino acid sequence identical to that encoded by plasmid DMAb was administered to separate groups of mice i.p. at doses ranging from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg. Control mice received non-specific protein IgG R347 i.p. Mice received intranasal infection with 3 \u00d7 LD50 of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) (9.5 \u00d7 104 TCID50/mouse), 7 \u00d7 LD50 of rA/HK/68 (H3) (1.2 \u00d7 105 TCID50/mouse), 10 \u00d7 LD50 B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Victoria) (3.6 \u00d7 104 TCID50/mouse), or 7 \u00d7 LD50 B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata) (7.0 \u00d7 104 TCID50/mouse). All mice were monitored daily for weight loss and survival for 12 days. The percent change in weight was calculated based on the pre-infection weight. Animals that lost \u2265 25% of their total weight were euthanized, and weight loss was recorded as the limit for the remainder of the study. Blood was collected on the day of infection to assess the amount of human IgG in the serum. To assess viral load in the lungs, additional mice were euthanized 5 days post infection. In homologous re-infection studies, blood samples were taken from all surviving mice 21 days after initial infection to confirm clearance and absence of human IgG (data not shown). Twenty-eight days after the initial infection, previously-infected surviving mice were re-challenged with a virus strain and lethal dose identical to the initial infection (alongside age-matched na\u00efve controls).",
