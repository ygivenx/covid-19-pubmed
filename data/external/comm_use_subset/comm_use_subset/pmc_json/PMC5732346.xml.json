Mycoplasma sp. is a Gram-negative bacterium, lacking a cell wall which commonly colonize in the respiratory tract of rats [1,2] causing murine respiratory mycoplasmosis (MRM). This disease frequently goes undiagnosed due to subclinical nature. MP is transmitted vertically through the placenta and horizontally through direct contact or aerosol [3,4], and thus, it is difficult to get rid of disease without following all-in\u2013all-out policy.",

MP commonly affects respiratory tract of animal; however, infection of the female reproductive tract is also found in some cases which may cause endometritis and perioophoritis leading to decreased fertility [5,6].

Animals were exposed to 12 h light/12 h dark cycle as a routine practice. The present incidence of MP infection was detected during routine health monitoring of animals. Two female Wistar rats were observed to be diseased thus kept in isolation for further serological, pathological, and molecular (PCR) investigations which revealed MP-induced MRM. Thereafter, whole rat colony comprising of 36 animals was segregated based on clinical symptoms. All the animals showing symptoms of stress and disease (N=2) were sampled for PCR-based molecular diagnosis. Further 6 animals of 32 asymptomatic rats were sampled and sacrificed to study the prevalence of disease in the entire colony.

MP is the cause of MRM, and its seroprevalence is high in India [13,14]. Our study indicates that severity of MP infection may vary within rat colony of the similar age group of animals housed together under the same environmental conditions. Some of the previously reported classical symptoms of MP associated respiratory tract infection such as labored breathing snuffing and hunched back [5] were observed in very few cases. Most of the animals (89%) did not show any symptoms of disease but showed pathological lesions in the lungs and were found to be PCR positive for MRM infection. No instigating factor for varying severity of disease was seen in rats. Symptoms may vary and disease may go undiagnosed in conventional animal facilities which do not adopt a stringent pathogen screening and monitoring program as the majority of the population may carry asymptomatic infection [13,14].",
