A recombinant L. plantarum vector expressing a non-targeted NP-M1-Ctrlpep fusion (pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep) and an \u201cempty\u201d vector control (pSIP409) were also generated. The recombinant plasmids were successfully constructed and used to transform L. plantarum (Fig. 1a). The expression of NP-M1-DCpep and NP-M1-Ctrlpep was observed in vitro. Cell pellets of cultures of NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep, NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep, and NC8-pSIP409 (empty vector) were subjected to western blotting detection using an anti-NP antibody. As shown in Fig. 1b, the proteins encoded by NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep and NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep formed a high-molecular-weight protein with a size of 83 kDa. The fusion antigen was also confirmed by anti-M1 Abs binding (Fig. S1).",

The co-culture of NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep with mouse DCs elicited a significant enhancement in the expression of the markers CD80+ and CD86+ on mouse DCs (Fig. 2b,c).

Their PPs, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and intestines were collected, and the cells were labelled with CD11c, CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II to analyse the expression of these molecules and determine the frequency of these activation markers on DCs. Compared with the controls, NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep induced a notable enhancement in the surface expression of CD80+, CD86+, CD40+, and MHC-II+ on CD11c+ cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine by 24 h post-vaccination (Fig. 2d). However, in contrast to the MLN, only CD11c+CD40+ and CD11c+CD80+ DCs were present in the PPs at 24 h post-vaccination (Fig. S2b,c). Furthermore, at 36 h post-vaccination, greater frequencies of CD11c+CD80+, CD11c+CD86+, CD11c+CD40+, and CD11c+MHC-II+ DCs were observed in the MLNs of mice treated with NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep (data not shown). These data also imply that DC activation initially occurs in the small intestine and PPs following oral NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep administration and that these activated DCs subsequently migrate to the MLN. The increased expression of DC activation markers may indicate the functional maturation of these APCs.",

Waterfowl are generally considered the natural reservoir of AIVs and can easily transmit viruses to other species, such as poultry, via migration. Transmission to other species likely requires pivotal genetic and antigenic mutations3233. Specific T cell responses are elicited by the relatively well conserved internal influenza antigens, which are an important component of the inherent immunity to influenza, particularly heterosubtypic AIVs. However, the current AIV vaccines do not provide cross-protection against different subtypes of AIVs. Hence, the development of safe and efficacious oral vaccines against a broader spectrum of AIVs that infect poultry has been actively pursued. These efforts are not intended to completely control the virus but rather to alleviate clinical symptoms, reduce virus shedding and accelerate recovery16. The T cell-mediated immune response could also offer much broader protection when combined with a humoral response, which can play a critical role incomplete protection against the influenza subtypes included within the vaccine and, importantly, partial protection against other subtypes to prevent a pandemic17.",

In addition, sIgA antibodies are the key effectors in the protection of the mucosa by the acquired immune response, including in the gut and respiratory tract36. In previous studies, Lactobacillus GG has been found to cause enhanced IgA production37, whereas L. Johnsonii leads to enhanced IgA production in PP whole-organ culture supernatants38. DCs may be associated with the mechanism underlying the enhanced IgA production by L. plantarum AYA39. Furthermore, we and other researchers have recently demonstrated that the oral administration of recombinant L. plantarum may contribute to the production of secretory IgA antibodies at the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract to combat infection with pathogens such as influenza virus254041. In this study, we extended our earlier findings and determined that NP-M1-DCpep delivered by L. plantarum significantly elicits B220+ IgA+ cells in the PP and ileum (data not shown). Our results indicate that NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep induces significantly higher levels of total and antigen-specific secretory IgA in faecal matter and the BALF in mice. Cytokines such as IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2 are associated with the differentiation of B cells and the induction of IgA4243. Our data also revealed that vaccination with recombinant L. plantarum likely contributes to the increased numbers of FAS+ PNA+ B220+ B cells in the PPs and MLNs to shape GCs within the mucosa in mice. We presume that recombinant L. plantarum or probiotics induce T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which contribute to T cell-dependent humoral immune responses by providing helper T cells to B cells and by contributing to GC formation and long-lived antibody responses44.",

IFN-\u03b3 producing T lymphocytes result in an enhanced specific killing function that effectively attacks AIVs, modulates chemotaxis and improves antigen presentation to elicit Th1 immune responses against AIV infection45. A previously published study of chickens vaccinated with MVA and in an adenovirus incorporating the NP+M1 construct has reported markedly improvedex vivo T cell IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot responses to NP and M1 peptides46. As determined by an IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay, the oral administration of L. plantarum expressing NP-M1-DCpep significantly enhanced immunity in the spleen and MLNs in response to stimulation with the NP and M1 epitopes. Interestingly, our data also support recent findings that IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells provide a protective immune response against influenza virus in humans47. In addition, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells efficiently responded to the NP and M1 epitopes after the final immunization. These data indicate that these specific T cell responses might be associated with the development of protective immunity after oral vaccination with recombinant L. plantarum.",

We previously demonstrated that the production of HA-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro also confers protection against lethal AIV (mouse-adapted H9N2) infection in mice, indicating a direct role of CD8+ T cells in improving mouse survival25. Perforin-deficient mice exhibit decreased cytotoxic activity in vitro or in vivo50. CD8+ T cells are cytolytic, and combatting cells infected with AIV or other viruses is generally considered their main role49. Perforin could induce this activity, resulting in the complete maturation of effector CD8+ T cells. The specific expression of CD107a or IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1 on CD8+ T cells is critical to determining the phenotype of the CD8+ T cells produced during our immunization schedules and associated with a protective immune response51. In this study, we observed that recombinant L. plantarum elicits the production of CD8+ CTLs with an activated type that may present cytotoxic activity to kill targets of the NP and M1 peptides in vivo. Our data are consistent with results from previous studies indicating that immunization with Lactococcus lactis expressing NP with a cholera toxin B subunit adjuvant in mice induces significant cellular immune responses at day 33 after the initial immunization52. The role of perforin in this response awaits further confirmation. Future studies should evaluate potential improvements in the survival of IFN-\u03b3-deficient or perforin-deficient mice. In addition, a study conducted by Seder\u2019s group suggests that vaccine-induced, multifunctional CD8+ cells secreting IL-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 play an important role in the protection against influenza virus infection17.",

The reason for this finding may be that the cells from the tissue were incubated with a mixed pool of NP and M1 peptides and an antibody against CD28, which resulted in the L. plantarum-expressed NP-M1-DCpep inducing more antigen-specific cytokines than the inactivated vaccine, which are based on the surface antigen-induced antibody immune response. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that CD28 signalling contributes to improving the survival of effector T cells in the lung53; however, the inhibition of CD28 signalling at the time of effecter T cell infiltration into the lung markedly decreases the effector cytokine secretion after influenza virus challenge54.",

In our experiment, however, the mice were immunized orally with recombinant L. plantarum and vaccine vectors using a primer-booster regime. In addition, the mice immunized with NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep started to recover eight days after challenge, and all of these mice survived (Fig. 10a,b), indicating a protective effect against homologous AIV challenge. However, the immunized mice challenged with 10 \u00d7 LD50 heterologous virus did not exhibit effective protection. Recombinant L. plantarum may not protect mice against H1N1 infection because the epitopes of the NPs or M1 from the H9N2 and HIN1 subtypes of AIV differ. Therefore, although the recombinant L. plantarum provides only limited protection against infection with a lethal dose of a heterologous virus, it can provide complete protection against infection with a sub-lethal dose of a heterologous virus. In future studies, we will examine more conservative vaccine epitopes to develop more effective vaccines.",

In this study, oral immunization with L. plantarum expressing NP-M1-Dcpep provided effective protection against heterologous influenza virus infection (Fig. 10e). In addition, L. plantarum-based vaccines have other advantages, including the protection of the integrity of the lungs, possibly because Tregs markedly improve the lungs of mice that administered L. rhamnosus65. Many studies have implicated Ag-specific Tregs in primary infections. In addition, antigen-specific memory regulatory CD4+Foxp3+ T cells contribute to immune regulation during memory responses to a previously encountered influenza virus, which play important regulatory roles in the cellular immune responses to viral infections and are thought to prevent pathological changes resulting from excessive immune responses66.",
