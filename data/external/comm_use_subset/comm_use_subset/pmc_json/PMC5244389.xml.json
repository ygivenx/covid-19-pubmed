The Shannon diversity index was used to quantify the diversity of commonness of k-mers using the fraction of k-mers shared by genomes. The preferred length is the one with a higher Shannon diversity index value (which represents more diversity in the commonness of k-mers) in the range suggested from criteria 1 and 2. When the three steps suggest multiple optimal lengths in the range, then the tree stability (based on Robinson\u2013Foulds distance) is also considered supporting information (see Materials and Methods for more details).",

We plotted CRE values for the 3,905 referenced viral genomes (Fig. 2), which are colored by genome size and ordered from smallest to largest genome. CRE curves did not simultaneously drop to <10% of the maximum CRE value for all genomes, which is the selection criterion that Wu et al.32 recommended. When curves for the smaller genomes achieve that goal, some curves for larger genomes are still at a plateau. At k = 9, the curves of small genomes start to fall <10% of the maximum CRE, and ~50% of all CREs drop to <20% of their maxima. At larger values of k (k = 10, 11, and 12), more genome CREs satisfy the <10% of the maximum criterion. When k = 13, the CRE values of most genomes fall to <10% of the maximum CREs. However, k = 13 cannot simply be chosen as the optimal feature length, because it might be too large (no information left) for small genomes. By quartile, the optimal k-mer lengths for subgroups Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are determined to be 9 to 11, 10 to 12, 11 to 13, and 12 to 15, respectively. Therefore, we initially determined the optimal range of k-mer lengths for the entire set of 3,905 genomes to be 9 to 13. This range will be refined in the following steps.",

Because of this, we did not use the comparison with random feature space; instead, we only used the denominator of the RSD to explore the average number of common features between pairwise genomes, which we call the ACF. For each genome, the ACF is defined as the average number of common features from a pairwise comparison of all the other genomes at a specific feature length (see Materials and Methods). As FFP is a pairwise-comparison method, the ACF is not expected to be very low among samples at the specific feature length. Otherwise, the obtained information will tend to be randomized, which means that it could produce a random phylogeny. On the other hand, very high ACF will lead to obtain a poor discrimination phylogeny.",

The ACF plot demonstrated that few features are shared when the feature length is larger than 11 (k > 11). As a result, the maximal feature length for 3,905 genomes should be 11 nucleotides. Therefore, the optimal range for k is reduced to 9\u201311. These curves were also coloured by different genome sizes, as in subgroups Q1\u2013Q4. As seen in the Fig. 3, the ACFs are increased with an increased genome size.

To illustrate the relationship between \u201call features\u201d and \u201call genomes\u201d, the distribution of feature occurrences in genomes was calculated and plotted. As shown in Fig. 5, when the feature length is small (k = 5, 6), most features can be found in most genomes; however, when the feature length is large (k = 14, 15), most features (>50% or 80%) are unique (occurrence = 1). In either scenario, the FFP method cannot work efficiently. After all, the feature occurrences should be diverse to balance the similarity and dissimilarity when comparing all genomes. For this purpose, the Shannon diversity index was applied and plotted with different feature lengths (Fig. 6). From the curve, the diversity of feature occurrence peaks at k = 7, and then drops steadily. In this regard, k = 9 is more appropriate than 10 or 11 within our previous optimal feature range.",

For the dendrogram of the 3,905 viral genomes, either 9 or 11 can be chosen as the optimal feature length. k = 10 has a lower ACF and Shannon diversity index, indicating a non-linear relationship in the dataset. When k = 9, CRE values have not yet dropped to <10% of their maximum, and the other two criteria perform well. When k = 11, most of the CRE values have droped to <10% of their maximum, although the ACF is not good for small viral genomes. In this case, it is hard to choose between 9 and 11, because neither can perfectly satisfy our three criteria. Therefore, it makes sense to check the tree stability and use it as supporting information for this study. To evaluate the tree stability, we calculated Robinson\u2013Foulds distances between k (5, 6, 7\u2026) and k + 1 at different feature lengths. When the Robinson\u2013Foulds distances drop to a low value, it means that the tree stability starts at this k point and the tree topology does not change much as feature lengths increase. As shown in Fig. 8, the trees start to converge at k = 9; therefore, we will choose k = 9 as the optimal feature length for this dendrogram. Furthermore, because we want to obtain a global view of the relationship among RefSeq viral genomes, the \u201cpairwise comparison perspective\u201d and \u201call genome comparison perspective\u201d are considered more important in this research than the exact estimation of individual genomes, especially when all sequences are RefSeq whole genomes (not as similar and sensitive).

The alignment-free method with k- mers is useful for comparing genomes with low homology and has been applied to various microbial studies. However, it is still not clear how to find the optimal feature length of k-mers in alignment-free phylogenomic analysis, especially for large-scale comparison of viral genomes. CRE and RSD values have been used as criteria in previous studies29313239, however, these studies used, at most, hundreds of genomes and their lengths did not change greatly. However, thousands of viral genomes in the NCBI RefSeq showed a great difference in size, which ranged from the smallest (Anguilla anguilla circovirus) at 1,378 nucleotides to the largest (Pandoravirus salinus) at 2,473,870 nucleotides. As a result, their CRE curves cannot simultaneously drop to <10% of maximum as required in previous studies. Furthermore, CRE reflects the ability to identify individual whole genomes at various lengths of k. More details should be taken into consideration when dealing with such highly-diverse data, such as pairwise-comparison information and shared k-mers among all genomes. Hence, we divided our dataset into four subgroups by 25%, 50%, and 75% quantiles cut-off of genomic size.",

If the results are not unique, the tree stability information (obtained from the Robinson\u2013Foulds distance) can be used to determine the optimal length of k. Based on these criteria, the optimal feature lengths for each subgroup have been identified and are shown in Table 2.

For this purpose, the union of all observed features at different k were calculated in our dataset, as well as their occurrence in genomes. Theoretically, the maximum number of all possible features is 4k. However, the biological sequences are not a random combinations of alphabets (nucleotide bases). As a result, the percentage of observed features relative to the maximum possible number of features decreases as feature length increases in our 3,905 genomes. To balance the level of similarity and dissimilarity, the occurrence for all observed features can be measured by the Shannon diversity index47:",

To strengthen the feasibility of our method, we used tree stability as an additional factor to determine the optimal feature length. Tree stability is estimated by calculating the topology difference between trees at feature length k (k = 5, 6, 7, \u2026\u2026) and k + 1 using Robinson\u2013Foulds distance48, which is a metric to compare differences between two phylogenies. Therefore, when the Robinson\u2013Foulds distances between trees at feature length k and k + 1 decrease to a low value, it means that the tree stability starts at this k point and the tree topology does not change much as k increases. In our case, trees start to converge at k = 9; therefore, k = 9 was chosen as the optimal feature length for the global dendrogram.",
