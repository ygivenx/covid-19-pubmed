Its case-fatality rate is 1% for overall infection and 15\u223c20% for severe cases among patients hospitalized. This mortality rate will increase sharply during epidemics or in pregnant women (Asogun et al., 2012). The etiologic agent of Lassa fever is Lassa virus (LASV), belonging to the arenavirus family. Arenavirus has more than 30 members divided into two groups: the New World viruses (or Tacaribe complex) and the Old World viruses (or LCM-Lassa complex). The New World family mainly contains Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF), Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF), while the Old World viruses includes, for example Lujo virus (LUJV), Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Morogoro virus (MORV), and LASV. These arenaviruses have both geographical and genetic differences.",

The two RNA segments in its genome encode four viral proteins, including zinc-binding protein (Z), RNA polymerase (L), nucleoprotein (NP), and the surface glycoprotein precursor (GP, or spike protein). GP is cleaved into envelope glycoproteins GP1 and GP2 (Cao et al., 1998). GP1 that is responsible for receptor binding (including \u03b1-dystroglycan, heparin sulfate, DC-SIGN, etc.) and GP2 that mediates membrane fusion interact with each other to form a stable trimer complex on the LASV viral envelope (Li et al., 2016; Hastie et al., 2017). Upon receptor binding, LASV enters the target cell via clathrin- and dynamin-independent endocytosis with subsequent transport to late endosomal compartments, where fusion occurs at low pH (Vela et al., 2007; Rojek et al., 2008). A recent study has also found that after GP1 binds to cell receptor \u03b1-dystroglycan, LASV enters into the target cell through the unusual micropinocytosis pathway and membrane fusion under low pH condition (Oppliger et al., 2016).",

            "text": "So far, no approved vaccines and specific treatment modalities against LASV are available. Given that the first peptide-based antiviral drug enfuvirtide (T20) inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion with and entry into the target cell by targeting the heptad repeat domain in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp41 (Qi et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017), the heptad repeat domain in GP2 of LASV may also serve as a target for the design of LASV fusion inhibitors. We have previously demonstrated that the N-terminal heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain binds to C-terminal heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain to form a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) to mediate viral entry; therefore, peptides derived from HR2 should specifically bind to the homotrimeric HR1, interfering with the formation of 6-HB and, hence, blocking viral entry (Zhu et al., 2015, 2016, Xia et al., 2019). Therefore, it is essential to determine the 6-HB core structure and characterize the interaction sites in the HR1 and HR2 domains, in order to design the HR2-derived peptides against LASV infection. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the post-fusion 6-HB formed by LASV HR1 and HR2 domains. Based on the structure, we designed several peptides spanning the HR2 domain and tested their antiviral activities. Concurrent with the preparation of the present manuscript, another group reported a post-fusion structure of LASV using the insect baculovirus expression system (Shulman et al., 2019), which allows us to compare the structural differences of 6-HB cores formed by the HR1 and HR2 domains in their truncated version of LASV GP2 spanning residues 306\u2013421 with those in our LASV HR1-T-loop-HR2 construct. These comparisons provide more comprehensive knowledge for better understanding the entry mechanism of LASV and designing of peptide-based LASV fusion inhibitors.",

We found that the longer HR2 peptides, HR2-2 (37-mer: 392-428), and HR2-3 (25-mer: 397-421), had higher binding affinity with HR1 peptide than the shorter HR2 peptides, HR2-4 (20-mer: 391-410), and HR2-5 (20-mer: 406-425), possibly owing to their rich hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Figure 4). Moreover, the longer peptides of HR2-1 (48-mer: 385\u2013432) and HR2-2 exhibited more obvious inhibitory activities against LASV G protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. These results suggest that the longer HR2-derived peptides, which have stronger affinity against the HR1 domain, also have more potent inhibitory activity. On the contrary, the shorter HR2 peptides, HR2-4 and HR2-5, do not interact with HR1 peptide, thus showing no cell\u2013cell fusion inhibitory activity. In the cell\u2013cell fusion process, the GP1 protein of LASV binds to its target receptor to expose the GP2 subunit. Then, the HR2 domain binds to the HR1 domain to form the 6-HB fusion core to mediate the formation of membrane fusion pores. At this time, the HR1 domain becomes a very exposed target for binding and blocking by an HR2-derived peptide. Therefore, the binding affinity of HR2 peptides is positively related to the inhibitory activity against LASV GPC protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion under low pH condition.",

It confirms that the HR2-peptides do not interact with the GP1 protein to block its interaction with the receptor on the target cell, the first step of viral entry. These findings also suggest that LASV enters the target cell using the fusion pathway different from that utilized by some other class I enveloped viruses, such as HIV and MERS-CoV (Qi et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2019), which get into the host cells via cytoplasm membrane fusion under neutral pH condition. Several groups have shown that LASV enters the host cell via clathrin- and dynamin-independent endocytosis and membrane fusion occurs at low pH (Vela et al., 2007; Rojek et al., 2008). Oppliger and coworkers (Oppliger et al., 2016) have recently reported that LASV enters the target cell through macropinocytosis. Since our results are consistent with those in the reports above, we proposed an infection model of LASV (Figure 6). Specifically, LASV enters the target cells via endocytosis, including macropinocytosis. In the membrane fusion process as revealed by the cell\u2013cell fusion assay, the GP1 trimer of LASV binds to its receptor(s), e.g., \u03b1-Dystroglycan, to trigger the conformational change of GP2. Then HR1 is exposed to bind with HR2 to form 6-HB, resulting in the fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membrane. Under these conditions, HR2-derived peptides could bind to the HR1 target to block viral infection. However, during the entry process of live and pseudotyped LASV, the HR1 domain of viral GP2 can only be exposed in the endosomal compartment and interacts with the HR2 domain of viral GP2 to mediate membrane fusion under low pH condition, making it impossible for HR2 peptides to enter the endosomal compartment to block membrane fusion there (Figure 6). Therefore, HR2 peptides must be modified, for example, by adding TAT cell penetration sequence (Miller et al., 2011) or hydrocarbon stapling motif (Wang et al., 2018), so that they can enter into the endosomal compartment inside the cell to interact with HR1 domain of the viral GP1 domain and inhibit the membrane fusion at low pH there.",
