Thirty-four species have been identified within this genus [2]. Acinetobacter spp. can colonize patients or the equipment used in medical care and survive on environmental surfaces for prolonged times [3]. Most clinical isolates are reported to be strains of Acinetobacter baumannii [4]. However, clinical infections caused by non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. have increased [5]. In the last decade, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter (CRA) has become worldwide public-health issue with a widespread distribution, broad range of activities against \u03b2-lactams, increased patient morbidity, mortality, and lengths of hospital stay [6], particularly among elderly patients, infants and patients with severe underlying disease. Therefore, there is growing concern about the increasing prevalence of CRA [7], and it is difficult for clinicians to choose the initially appropriate antibiotic therapy [8].",

The most common carbapenemases in Acinetobacter are the class D oxacillinases (OXA), including OXA-23-like, OXA-40-like, OXA-51-like, and OXA-58-like enzymes [10]. In recent years, carbapenemases from classes B have also been involved[7]. New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), a novel metallo-\u03b2-lactamase, was first reported in India in 2008 [11], and is a rapidly emerging resistance gene of the family Enterobacteriaceae [7]. However, according to two recent large-scale polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based surveillance programs for NDM-1 in China [12, 13], Acinetobacter is the primary blaNDM-1-positive genus rather than members of the Enterobacteriaceae.",

A. baumannii and class D oxacillinase genes have been detected simultaneously with multiplex conventional PCR [14, 15],however, conventional PCR required openning the tubes for procedures post detection during the reaction which might cause contamination and lead to false-positive results [16]. Therefore,the use of real-time PCR and LAMP is attractive, because they are highly sensitive and specific, time efficient, and generate fewer false-positive results. As we known,the LAMP method is difficult to apply in a multiplex assay because six primers are used to detect one target sequence [17], while probe-based and dye-based multiplex real-time PCR assays have been used to detect several targets simultaneously. Fluorescently labeled target-specific probes can add significant costs to an assay,however,intercalating dyes such as SYBR Green I have been reported suitable for multiplex real-time PCR systems, it detect all double stranded DNA, and PCR products can be distinguished by their melt curves [18\u201322].",

In recent decades, Acinetobacter spp. have become a public-health issue because they play important roles in nosocomial infections [30]. The serious concern associated with these bacteria is the growing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant isolates. Therefore, surveillance and early detection are required to control these infections and prevent their further spread, so a sensitive and specific detection system for CRA is required. Although the multiplex real-time PCR technology has been extensively used for the rapid detection of pathogens, the SYBR-Green-I-based multiplex real-time PCR assays developed in this study are less expensive than probe-based multiplex real-time PCR assays [31]. Here, we have described the development and validation of two multiplex real-time PCR assays for CRA, and demonstrated their potential utility in the direct detection of tracheal and gastrointestinal colonization by A. baumannii and non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. carrying the blaNDM, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-40-like, blaOXA-51-like, and blaOXA-58-like genes in sputum and fecal specimens.",
