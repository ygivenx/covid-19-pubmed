After January 1, 2015, all confirmed patients except pregnant women were treated in Jui Government Hospital; the confirmed EVD patients who were pregnant women were transferred to a designated ETC (P.T.S.1 Ebola Treatment Center). We carried out follow-up studies and data collections from all confirmed patients (both the patients treated in Jui Government Hospital and those transferred to other hospitals) before we finished our mission in March 2015. Data collected included observations such as the duration of hospitalization, the date when blood EBOV turned negative, and the endpoint (recovery or death). The determination of recovery was based on the clinical presentations and the interpretation of laboratory findings. Discharge from hospitalization was considered when the following criteria were met: 1) three or more days without fever or any other significant symptom, 2) significant improvement in clinical presentations, 3) a relatively good general condition, and 4) a negative PCR result for blood EBOV on the third day of being asymptomatic. If a patient continued to suffer symptoms or their condition was not improving, but it was suspected to be unrelated to EVD, then two blood EBOV tests were carried out 48 h apart, with at least one test being done 3 days or more after the onset of symptoms. If both test results were negative, patients were discharged or referred to a normal hospital for further care.",

After 24 h all adult patients with confirmed EVD received 2 g of ceftriaxone every 24 h, 500 mg of metronidazole every 8 h, 500-1 000 ml of Ringer\u2019s lactate every 12 h, and 500-1 000 ml of dextrose saline (5 % and 0.9 %, respectively) every 12 h. All the above medications were administered intravenously. Adult patients also received a 20 mg zinc sulfate tablet daily, a 400 mg acetaminophen tablet every 12 h, and 8 mg of ondansetron injection intravenously as needed for nausea or vomiting. After the first 3 days, continuing therapy included a 400 mg metronidazole tablet every 12 h for 7 days, a 500 mg cefuroxime tablet every 12 h for 5 days, and a 400 mg acetaminophen tablet every 12 h. The protocol for children was similar but the dosage was adjusted according to their body weight. Oral rehydration solution and juice were provided on an as needed basis. We transfused more fluid to the patients with profound GI losses and those unable to take oral fluids or medications. Currently, early supportive care, empiric antibiotic therapy, and maintenance of water and electrolyte balance are the basic interventions to treat EVD due to the lack of specific anti-EBOV drugs.

Our observation revealed that blood EBOV turned negative very slowly\u2014only 63.69 % patients turned blood EBOV negative in 3 weeks. This partially explained why EVD spread so widely and persisted for so long in West Africa. The surviving EVD patients in our study were discharged after the symptoms remained absent for 48 h, and the blood samples were negative for EBOV in two consecutive tests with quantitative RT-PCR assay. The mean hospitalization time for surviving patients was 20.38 \u00b1 7.58 days. In other studies, the researchers continued to monitor EBOV RNA levels in sputum, saliva, conjunctiva swabs, stool, urine, and sweat using real-time RT-PCR assay after the blood EBOV RNA turned negative. They found that urine samples remained positive for EBOV RNA for as long as 13 days after blood turned negative,and sweat samples remained positive throughout the observation period for an additional 10 days (23 days after blood became EBOV RNA negative [7]). Another study reported that EBOV existed in cerebral spinal fluids and semen for much longer in EVD patients [8]. Even Varkey and colleagues described a patient who recovered from EVD and subsequently showed severe unilateral uveitis during convalescence. In this case, viable Zaire Ebola virus was detected in aqueous humour 14 weeks after the onset of EVD and 9 weeks after the clearance of EBOV from the blood [9]. Such findings warrant further investigations in the future. Although it was unclear whether or not such residual viruses were pathogenic, these findings suggested that when EVD patients are recovered and discharged, they should be put on continued quarantine for a period of time to avoid close contact with other people.",

Just as some scholars stated, the lack of public awareness of the disease as well as the lack of synergy among governments and international organizations contributed to the current epidemic [18].

The previous reports showed that older age was associated with worse outcomes, and the association between the two was often attributable to increased coexisting conditions in the elderly [10, 11, 14, 15]. In contrast, we did not find statistically significant differences between the age of non-survivors and survivors in our study (median age: 29 (IQR: 17\u201340) vs.27 (IQR: 17\u201335); average age: 29.32 \u00b1 16.34 vs.28.97 \u00b1 16.52). In order to determine the association between age and prognosis, we grouped the patients using different cutoffs, including median age (28), the cutoffs used in other studies (age 30, 40, 50), and multiple age groups at intervals of 5 years. In our comparison of the different age groups, no association was found between age group and prognosis. One distinction in our study was that the mortality rate for younger patients under the age of 6 was higher than the other age groups. This may be explained as follows: in the beginning of the EVD outbreak, adult patients encountered many complications such as diarrhoea-related electrolyte disorders and secondary infections, but soon received sufficient fluid therapy in many ETCs, so the mortality rate dropped among those patients. But for young children, since there was a shortage of paediatricians in many centres, the paediatric patients may not always have received sufficient attention or optimized therapy [22]. The young children were unable to care for themselves and their daily fluid intake was not always guaranteed while solely depending on the limited hospital resources. Additionally, poor access to IV vessels in paediatric patients may limit both the amount and the flow rate of fluid administered.",

Although the diagnostic value was excellent for postmortem swab samples [24], it was unclear how a Cycle Threshold (Ct) value from an oral swab correlates with that from a whole blood sample, therefore the viral load data for the oral swab samples (27/285) were not included in the analysis. The relationship between the viral load (copies of EBOV per milliliter) and the fatality rate was investigated. ROC curve analysis was plotted and a positive correlation was found between the two. A low viral load was associated with a better survival outcome, whereas a high viral load was an important indicator for fatality rate. Our finding was consistent with those of the previous reports [10, 11, 16, 23]. Based on this finding, it is plausible to assign patients with virus load of \u2265106 copies/ml to dedicated wards, where they can receive enhanced medical support and palliative care if resources allow, given their increased risk of death. It is noteworthy that the 27 cases for which EVD was confirmed using oral swab samples were all severely ill patients who died soon after admission. Exclusion of these cases may have introduced some bias in our results.",

However, in this outbreak, the reported bleeding rates ranged from 2.27 % [11] to 51.00 % [10]. In our study, only 35 of 285 patients (12.28 %) suffered from visible bleeding during their hospitalization, which is a relatively low number when comparing to other reports [25]. This suggested that bleeding may not be a major characteristic of EVD patients in this outbreak.

The incidences of various symptoms in EVD patients reported here are consistent with those of previous reports, with only minor differences. The most common EVD manifestations on admission were fever, weakness, loss of appetite, vomiting, cough, abdominal pain, headache, joint pain, and diarrhoea. In addition to factors such as age and viral load, previous studies described many other important factors associated with fatal outcomes, including hiccups, haemorrhagic signs, fever, weakness, dizziness, diarrhoea, myalgia, difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue, vomiting, mental symptoms, loss of appetite, confusion, and conjunctivitis [11\u201314, 16, 26]. The multivariate analyses in each study may include one or more of the aforementioned presentations. This indicated that: first, none of the clinical manifestations observed among patients in this outbreak was unique; and second, the way the patient history information was collected may vary in each study.",

It is understandable that high viral load is related to fatality rate, and that digestive discomfort may be associated with patients\u2019 prognosis. In our study, the most powerful predictor of mortality in the multivariable regression model was confusion at admission (P value = 0.010), with an Odds Ratio of 4.150 (95 % CI: 1.401\u201312.293) favouring mortality. This finding indicated that the more severe the condition was at the time of admission, the higher the risk of death. We observed that due the lack of peculiar presentations of EVD and the less-developed health care capacity in Africa, many patients failed to seek medical attention promptly after they experienced some non-specific symptoms such as fever, thus delaying the diagnosis and treatment. Some patients died on their way to the hospital, some died upon arrival before the physicians had the opportunity to examine them, and yet some died on day 1 (11/285) or day 2 (23/285) after admission. In these circumstances, it was too late for the patients to receive proper treatment for such a severe disease. Therefore, we should raise the public\u2019s awareness that early discovery, early diagnosis, and early treatment are essential.",

In our clinical observations, we found that the clinical presentations in this EVD outbreak was primarily severe gastro enteric symptoms, such as nausea and lack of appetite accompanied by excessive vomiting and severe diarrhoea. Although due to the limitations of the medical equipment, we were unable to carry out laboratory tests to determine the cause of death for each non-survivor, we suspected that the loss of body fluids, abnormal metabolism, electrolytes imbalance, and hypovolemic shock, which were all secondary to the severe digestive tract disorder, may have been the immediate causes in the death of most non-surviving patients. The patients are usually extremely weak after the onset of the disease and cannot eat or drink by themselves; therefore it is essential for the medical staff, while taking precautions to protect themselves, to administer adequate fluids to the patients as early and as quickly as possible. Early initiation of proactive fluid therapy, particularly in the first days of hospitalization and even before the EBOV test results are received, is vital to saving patients\u2019 lives and reducing fatality rate.",

Unfortunately, we did not have a cross-contamination-proof testing facility in place while our centre was serving as an EHC or in its early stage of serving as an ETC. Therefore, we were unable to determine whether the 139 non-survivors died of EVD complications, related co-infections, or some other causes. We only evaluated the severity of the illness by the clinical manifestations, and transfused more fluid for the patients with profound GI losses and those unable to take oral fluids or medications. The biochemical testing and the testing for co-infection with malaria were not launched until a later stage due to the limitation of laboratory facilities.
