This is the first study to investigate the association between MBL2 polymorphisms with pulmonary TB susceptibility in northern Han Chinese. By genotyping all of the four functional SNPs in the MBL2 gene in the case-control population of relatively large sample size, we found that one SNP (A/B) was associated with susceptibility to TB (P = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22126). Furthermore, we found that the LYPB haplotype showed a significant association with increased risk of TB in northern Han Chinese (P = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22126). In addition, individuals bearing haplotype pairs indicating medium or low MBL2 expression had an increased risk of TB (P = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22126). We noted that Wu et al. have reported that LYPB haplotype was associated with TB in southern Chinese23. However, frequencies of MBL2 haplotypes in Wu\u2019s study were remarkably different from those in Chinese subjects observed in other studies. For example, frequencies of HYPA, LYPB, LXPA, LYQA and LYPA were 51.3%, 14.0%, 14.5%, 13.2% and 7.0% respectively in the controls in the present study, similar to the frequency distribution of these haplotypes in southern and northern Chinese in the 1000 genomes project. However, in the controls in Wu\u2019s study frequencies of HYPA, LYPB, LXPA, LYQA and LYPA were 29.3%, 0.9%, 7.1%, 3.6% and 37.1% respectively. Based on the large sample size, haplotype pairs analyses and small P values, our results may be closer to the real situation of MBL2 polymorphisms in TB susceptibility.",

The variant B allele can impair the formation of a triple helix in the collagenous tail, and therefore disrupts MBL polymerization and leads to enzymatic degradation and functional deficiency of this protein28. The other SNPs, H/L, X/Y, and P/Q, also play roles in determining functional MBL concentration, among which the X allele shows the lowest transcriptional activity252930. When in haplotype, these SNPs form three defective haplotypes (LYPB, LYQC and HYPD, with the latter two absent among Chinese), and five functional haplotypes with different expression levels (a low-producing LXPA haplotype, an intermediate-producing LYPA haplotype, and two high-producing haplotypes LYQA and HYPA)30. The results that B allele, LYPB haplotype, and medium- or low-expression haplotype pairs were associated with increased risk of developing TB (Tables 1, 2 and 3) suggest that MBL deficiency possibly plays a role in susceptibility to TB.",

Previous studies have revealed that MBL recognizes M. tuberculosis by direct interaction, resulting in lectin pathway activation, agglutination of bacteria and enhancement of phagocytosis3132. Additionally, the serum samples from carriers of haplotype pairs associated with high MBL levels (HYA/HYA) display significantly higher antibacterial activity of neutralization than did those associated with lower MBL levels, and the activity is mediated by MBL15. Therefore, one speculative interpretation of our results is that low serum concentrations of functional MBL caused by haplotype pairs indicating medium or low MBL2 expression might result in reduced neutralization and favor the survival of M. tuberculosis.",

The significance of deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the online software SNPStats (http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats_web). Unconditional logistic regressions under a dominant inheritance model were used due to the limited sample size, to calculate P values, Odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for assessing the association between SNPs and disease risk, adjusting for age and gender (fixed effects). In additional analyses, age and gender were treated as random effects in the logistic regression to deal with the uncertainties with more flexibility. The glm-function and glmer-function in the lme4 package (version 1.1\u201312)33 of R (version 3.3.1)34 were used to fit the models with fixed effects and random effects, respectively.
