Using this method, we observed virus movements in two dimensions (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). Generally, IAV movement can be described as gradual (crawling). However, occasional rapid (gliding) motion is observed (Fig. 1d). Virus gliding was also observed at a very low concentration of virus, indicating that gliding is different from one virus being released from the surface and then another virus immediately attaching to the surface. Virus movements were observed over a wide range of virus receptor densities (Fig. 1e). Glass surfaces were coated with a fetuin-albumin mixture in which the fetuin ratio (FR) varied from 0 to 100%. Although the actual fetuin density on the glass surface was unknown, the FR is the relative receptor density. The viruses clearly moved on surfaces coated with 2~50% fetuin. At low FRs (<2%), viruses did not move on the surface. Most virus particles immediately detached themselves from the surface without crawling or gliding. As the coating FR increased over 50%, the number of immobile viruses increased. Because virus motility was most active at a FR of around 10%, all subsequent virus movement experiments were performed on the glass surface coated with 10% fetuin.",

As the displacement elongated, its appearance frequency became lower. Therefore, virus motions with long displacements were difficult to analyse by the normal frequency function, P(r) (Supplementary Fig. S1). ECCDF is useful to estimate whether noisy tails of frequency functions obey power or exponential laws, because ECCDF is the integral of the frequency function. The ECCDF curve consisted of two different phases and the boundary displacement between the two phases was 0.2 \u03bcm per second (Fig. 2a). Here, we defined motion shorter than 0.2 \u03bcm per second as crawling and motion longer than 0.2 \u03bcm per second as gliding. Because ECCDF analysis could not distinguish crawling and stationary phases, the lower limit of crawling motion was unknown. Moreover, the exact speed of gliding remained unknown. Even higher speed image recording every 0.1 second could not trace viruses while gliding, indicating that gliding events were completed within 0.1 second. However, ECCDF analysis showed that the gliding frequency was 3%, and the remaining 97% included crawling and stationary phases (Fig. 2a). The frequencies observed for crawling and gliding suggest that both motions are different from the process in which a virus floats away from a fetuin-coated glass surface, moves three-dimensionally in a Brownian fashion in the surrounding water, and then returns to the glass surface. Figure 2b shows a simulated plot (blue), which is a power function unlike the experimental data (red), suggesting that IAV particles do not float in water when they are crawling or gliding.",

Nevertheless, NA inhibitors reportedly suppress virus infection, indicating a major role of NA in infection262728. However, the specifics of this functional role remained unclear. We hypothesised that NA contributes to the movement of virus particles toward endocytosis regions. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of a NA inhibitor, zanamivir, on Aichi2 virus crawling and gliding motions on fetuin-coated surfaces. This NA inhibitor completely blocked virus crawling and gliding, resulting in the immobilisation of virus particles on the glass surface (Fig. 3a, and Supplementary Movie S3). This finding indicates that NA contributes to the initiation of crawling and gliding motions.",

            "text": "To elucidate the role of NA in the observed crawling and gliding motions in more detail, we examined this process with recombinant viruses harbouring NA mutations that were generated by reverse genetics. Previously, amino acid substitution of arginine residues to lysine residues at the NA catalytic site has been reported to decrease NA enzymatic activity29. We introduced mutations into the catalytic site of NA in the A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) (PR8) virus and created two NA mutant (R103K and R278K) viruses. The wild-type and NA R278K viruses were able to move by crawling and gliding on the glass surfaces coated with immobilised fetuin, and their movements were similar to the movement exhibited by the Aichi2 virus (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Movies S4 and S5). In contrast, the NA R103K virus did not exhibit any movement (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Movie S6). Results from quantitative analysis of virus movement showed that the motile activity of NA R278K virus was lower than that of the wild-type virus (Fig. 3c and d). Specifically, the gliding frequency of the NA R278K virus (1.0%) was lower than that of the wild-type virus (1.4%) (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, the tail of the ECCDF curve for the NA R278K virus decreased more rapidly than that of the wild-type virus, indicating that its gliding length was shorter than that of the wild-type virus (Fig. 3c). Consequently, the diffusion coefficient of the NA R278K virus (0.21 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2/s) was 3.4 times smaller than that of the wild-type virus (0.72 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2/s) (Fig. 3d). The NA enzymatic activity of total viral proteins (i.e., for a virus particle) of the NA R278K virus was 34.5% relative to that of the wild-type virus (Table 1). The lower NA activity resulted in a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of virus movement (i.e., limited motility) from the diminished virus gliding frequency and gliding length, indicating that NA contributes to both initiation and elongation of the gliding movement. Whereas the NA enzymatic activity of total viral proteins of the NA R103K virus was similar to that of the NA R278K virus, the NA R103K virus lacked motility and was markedly different from the NA R278K virus (Table 1, Fig. 3b, and Supplementary Movies S5 and S6). However, the expression level of the NA R103K molecule was 40.6% relative to that of the wild-type NA, whereas that of the NA R278K molecule was 83.2% (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table 1). Importantly, these data suggest that initiation of virus crawling and gliding appears to require both adequate NA activity and a certain density of NA molecules on the virus surface.",

The NA inhibitor zanamivir adversely affected virus movement on the cell surface, resulting in movements similar to those of zanamivir-treated viruses on fetuin-coated surfaces (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Movie S8). This result indicates that IAV particle movement on erythrocytes is driven by the HA-receptor exchange mechanism that is accelerated by NA. In the presence of an NA inhibitor, a previous report showed that IAV particles embed in the erythrocyte membrane28. Presumably, abolished NA activity induces an increase in HA-receptor binding cross-bridges around the virus particle, causing the virus to eventual embed in the membrane. More importantly, NA activity that restricts the number of HA-receptor cross-bridges might contribute to virus movement on an actual cell surface rather than virus movement on a receptor-coated glass surface.",

Our observation of NA-dependent IAV movement on cells implies that virus movement contributes to endocytosis of IAVs. To determine whether virus movement via HA-receptor exchange contributes to their delivery to endocytosis regions, we examined virus fusion inside of cells and the effects of zanamivir on such fusion. Following endocytosis, viruses fuse with the endosomal membrane130. To detect virus-endosome fusion, we used an imaging technique in which virus-endosome fusion induces fluorescence colour changes from red to green in viruses labelled with two different fluorescent probes, R18 and 3,3\u2032-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine (DiOC18) (Fig. 4b)31. We also applied this technique to evaluate the effects of zanamivir on virus-endosome fusion in cultured A549 cells. In the presence of zanamivir, cells were inoculated with R18- and DiOC18-labelled Aichi2 viruses for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Following infection, virus particles predominantly fluoresced red (Fig. 4b), whereas in the absence of the inhibitor, virus particles fluoresced green. These observations indicate that the NA inhibitor suppresses virus-endosome fusion. Because zanamivir blocked virus movements by HA-receptor exchange (Fig. 3a), this finding suggests that virus movement may accelerate virus internalisation.",

            "text": "A significant conclusion of this study is that IAV can move using the HA-receptor exchange mechanism (Fig. 1). The virus movement included crawling and gliding motions (Figs 1 and 2). Virus NA contributed to initiation of the crawling and gliding as well as to elongation of the gliding (Fig. 3). Based on these results, we devised a model (Fig. 5) describing the crawling and gliding mechanism of IAV on the fetuin-coated surface. In the first step (Fig. 5a), immediately following virus attachment to the fetuin-coated surface, multiple receptor molecules tightly bind virus particles to the surface via HA, forming HA-receptor pairs. When there are enough NA molecules near the virus attachment site, bound HA-receptor pairs decrease in number and the virus becomes loosely attached to the cell surface (Fig. 5b). Loosely attached virus particles on the fetuin-coated surface are hit by water molecules and forced three-dimensionally from all directions. The interaction of HA and receptors keeps the virus particle on the cell surface, and their iterative association and dissociation translocate the virus on the surface two-dimensionally. In this situation, the impact of water molecules and receptor exchange of HA act as a driving force and direction control machinery, respectively, for virus movement. The loosely attached virus continues to move until it reaches a site where enough HA-receptor pairs can form, again tightly binding the virus to the surface (Fig. 5c). Because there are two types of virus motion, crawling and gliding, there are at least two loosely bound states with different affinities of the virus particle for receptors. When the loosely attached virus with a relatively higher affinity is captured by receptors that are close (<0.2 \u03bcm), it performs a crawling motion. When the loosely attached virus with a relatively lower affinity is captured by receptors that are further apart (\u22650.2 \u03bcm), it performs a gliding motion. While the virus particle is gliding, NA degrades the receptors, limiting the number of HA-receptor interactions, prolonging the loose binding state with the lower affinity, thereby increasing the gliding length.",

This effect probably underestimates the contribution of virus movement to viral infections in vivo. Reportedly, NA inhibitors decrease the levels of infection in primary cultured respiratory epithelial cells by 20\u2013500 fold26. Although the effect of the NA inhibitor on cultured epithelia may be caused by various factors such as the mucus layer containing sialoglycoproteins, virus movement via HA-receptor exchange might be an important factor. In cultured epithelia, influenza viruses preferentially infect non-ciliated cells7. Because the non-ciliated cells are surrounded by ciliated cells and the surface of non-ciliated cells is covered with cilia, intercellular migration from ciliated to non-ciliated cells is necessary for virus infection. Whereas lateral movement of virus receptors along the cell membrane cannot enable intercellular virus migration, virus movement via HA-receptor exchange could explain how intercellular migration occurs in cultured epithelia. Virus movement mediated by HA-receptor exchange likely plays a crucial role in the infection of epithelial cells in the respiratory tract.",

IAV receptors are sialoglycoproteins and sialoglycolipids. Therefore, unlike VSV and SFV, IAV cannot selectively attach to receptor molecules mediating endocytosis (Supplementary Table S1). To escape from immobile receptors, IAV might need to move via the HA-receptor exchange mechanism. In addition to influenza viruses, several paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, such as parainfluenza, Sendai viruses, and bovine coronavirus, employ sialoglycoproteins and sialoglycolipids as viral receptors3435.

            "text": "We further hypothesised that altering the ratio of crawling and gliding motions might influence IAV host specificity. IAV host specificity is dependent on virus receptor types. Human influenza HAs attach to oligosaccharides with terminal sialic acids (SA) linked to neighbouring galactoses (Gal) via \u03b12\u20136 linkages (SA\u03b12\u20136 Gal), whereas avian virus HAs attach to oligosaccharides via SA\u03b12\u20133 Gal linkages36. However, human influenza HAs attach to SA\u03b12\u20133 Gal with substantial affinity, and the dissociation coefficients of HA from SA\u03b12\u20136 Gal and SA\u03b12\u20133 Gal are 2.1 mM and 3.2 mM, respectively11. In addition to the receptor type, the functional balance between HA affinity and NA catalytic activity is important for virus infectivity of specific host cells373839. The IAV movement pattern depended on receptor density and NA activity (Figs 1d,e and 3). Virus crawling and gliding presumably depend on the balance between HA affinity and NA activity. IAV might change virus movement patterns by modifying HA and NA to adapt to host cell surface properties, such as shape, viral receptor density, or composition, thus resulting in maximal infectivity. In the future, further characterisation of human influenza virus movement patterns could help to identify virus strains that are a high risk to public health.",

This novel motility mechanism enables efficient access to target cells or cellular surface domains with high endocytosis activity. Until now, it was generally accepted that no viruses, including influenza, possess motile machinery. Our findings confirmed the presence of motile machinery employing HA and NA molecules in IAV. This virus motility mechanism is different from those known to exist in bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Further studies on this virus motility mechanism, particularly quantitative analysis of HA affinity and NA activity, might lead to a new paradigm for molecular mechanisms and energy transfer mechanics. Furthermore, systematic analysis and categorisation of the movement patterns of various viral strains could provide valuable information to understand the infectivity and host specificity of influenza viruses.",

The virus was previously thought to move passively by lateral movement of the viral receptor, a sialoglycoprotein or sialoglycolipid (green), through the membrane lipid bilayer (left). This mechanism is identical to the endocytosis of transferrin, low density lipoproteins (LDL), insulin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF)145. However, compared with the bindings between these physiological ligands and their receptors, the binding between HA and its receptor is remarkably weak. We hypothesise that IAV movement occurs via HA-receptor exchanges where iterative association and dissociation between HAs and their receptors serve to translocate the virus particle across the surface (right). (b) Schematic of the setup to directly observe virus movements. To test our hypothesis, fetuin, functioning as a viral receptor, was fixed to the surface of glass coverslips. IAV (Aichi2) was labelled with R18, a lipophilic fluorescent probe. The use of TIRFM allowed observation of single viruses that were adjacent to the surface.

In both plots, ECCDFs are shown in red. A double exponential function in which the boundary is approximately 0.2 \u03bcm was observed in the semi-log plot of the ECCDF (a). ECCDF of simulated data (blue) assuming that the viruses float from the glass surface into water, move in a Brownian fashion, and return to the surface is shown for comparison with the ECCDF of actual virus movements (b). Individual virus motility was analysed (c). Gliding frequency was calculated by dividing the number of image frames recording gliding events by the number of total frames. The displacement of IAV particles was analysed, using a two-dimensional random diffusion (random walk) model (d). The mean square displacement* (MSD) of viruses (red) was fitted by the equation for two-dimensional random diffusion (blue): \u2329R2\u232a = 4Dt, where \u2329R2\u232a is the MSD of viruses and D is the diffusion coefficient. This fitting resulted in D = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2/s. *Note: the displacement (R) of the MSD in (c) is taken from the position where the virus particles initially attach, which is not the same as the displacement per second shown in (a and b).",
