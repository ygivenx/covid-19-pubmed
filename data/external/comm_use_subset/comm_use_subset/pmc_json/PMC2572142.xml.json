By Mid Pleistocene (\u223c500,000 years ago), lions occupied Europe and by the Late Pleistocene (\u223c130,000\u201310,000 years ago) lions had the greatest intercontinental distribution for a large land mammal (excluding man), ranging from Africa into Eurasia and the Americas [3]. Lions were extirpated from Europe 2,000 years ago and within the last 150 years from the Middle East and North Africa. Today, there are less than 50,000 free-ranging lions [4] that occur only in sub-Saharan Africa and the Gir Forest, India (Figure 1A).",

            "text": "Understanding the broader aspects of lion evolutionary history has been hindered by a lack of comprehensive sampling and appropriately informative genetic markers [5]\u2013[9], which in species of modern felids requires large, multigenic data sets due to its generally rapid and very recent speciation [10],[11]. Nevertheless, the unique social ecology of lions [12]\u2013[14] and the fact that lions have experienced well-documented infectious disease outbreaks, including canine distemper virus, feline parvovirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, and lion feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVPle) [15]\u2013[18] provide a good opportunity to study lion evolutionary history using both host and virus genetic information. Indeed, population genetics of transmitted pathogens can accurately reflect the demographic history of their hosts [19],[20]. Unlike other of the 36 cat species, lions have a cooperative social system (prides of 2\u201318 adult females and 1\u20139 males) and their populations can have high frequencies of FIVPle, a lentivirus analogous to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS-like immunodeficiency disease in domestic cats. FIVPle is a retrovirus that integrates into the host genome and is transmitted by cell-to-cell contact, which in felids occurs during mating, fighting and mother-to-offspring interactions. Thus, viral dissemination is a function in part of the frequency of contact between infected and na\u00efve lions within and among populations. The virus is quite genetically diverse in lions [15],[18], offering a unique marker for assessing ongoing lion demographic processes.",

Distinct sets of markers may not necessarily yield similar inferences of population history, as coalescent times vary as a function of their pattern of inheritance [21]. There is also a large variance in coalescent times across loci sharing a common pattern of inheritance especially in complex demographical histories (Table 1). However, the accurate interpretation of the differences among loci can provide a more resolved and coherent population history, affording more-nuanced insights on past demographic processes, levels of admixture, taxonomic issues, and on the most appropriate steps for effective conservation and management of remaining populations.",

The autosomal nDNA sequences showed fairly distinct patterns of variation (Figure 1; Figure S1). Of the five ADA haplotypes, A2 was the most common and most-widely distributed. The other four haplotypes, which are derived and much less common, included one (A5) that was fixed in Asian lions. The three TF haplotypes were more widely and evenly distributed.",

The significant positive and monotonic correlation across all the scatterplot pairwise comparisons for the nDNA markers (bi-parental) was consistent with isolation-by-distance across the sampled region. However, the correlation between nDNA F\nST and geographic distance considerably decreased when the Asian Gir population was removed (R\n2 = 0.19; Mantel's test, P = 0.0065) suggesting that caution should be taken in interpreting the pattern of isolation-by-distance in lions. We further compared linearized F\nST estimates [24] plotted both against the geographic distance (model assuming habitat to be arrayed in an infinite one-dimensional lattice) and the log geographic distance (model assuming an infinite two-dimensional lattice). The broad distribution of lions might suggest a priori that a two-dimensional isolation-by-distance model would provide the best fit for the nDNA data (R\n2 = 0.25; Mantel's test, P = 0.0022), but instead the one-dimensional isolation-by-distance model performed better (R\n2 = 0.71; Mantel's test, P = 0.0476) (Figure S2).",

The removal of the Ken population considerably increased the correlation between mtDNA F\nST and geographic distance (R\n2 = 0.27; Mantel's test, P = 0.0035).

Alternatively, selection for matrilineally transmitted traits upon which neutral mtDNA alleles hitchhike is possible, given the low values of nucleotide diversity of the mtDNA (\u03c0 = 0.0066). A similar process has been suggested in whales (\u03c0 = 0.0007) [25] and African savannah elephants (\u03c0 = 0.0200) [26], where both species have female phylopatry and like lions, a matriarchal social structure. However, genetic drift tends to overwhelm selection in small isolated populations, predominantly affecting haploid elements due to its lower effective population size (Table 1). Therefore, we suggest that the contrasting results obtained for nDNA and mtDNA are more likely further evidence that lion populations underwent severe bottlenecks. The highly structured lion matrilines comprise four monophyletic mtDNA haplo-groups (Figure 4A; Figure S3). Lineage I consisted of a divergent haplotype H4 from Ken, lineage II was observed in most Southern Africa populations, lineage III was widely distributed from Central and Northern Africa to Asia, and lineage IV occurred in Southern and Eastern Africa.",

Indeed, despite the low geographic distance within East-African lion populations, the FIVPle genetic divergence showed a broader range in F\nST (0.03 to 0.79 for most of first cluster; Figure 3). By contrast, approximately half of the range in F\nST (0.26 to 0.69 for the second cluster; Figure 3) was observed among East and Southern Africa in spite of its large geographic separation.

Lineage II, found in Nam, Bot-II and Kru has an estimated coalescence of 169,000 years (95% CI: 34,000\u2013304,000) and the more widespread lineage IV found in the Southern populations of Bot-I, Bot-II and Kru as well as the Eastern populations of Ser (I, II, and III), Ngc and Uga, coalesces \u223c101,000 years ago (95% CI: 11,000\u2013191,000). However, the similar levels of nDNA genetic diversity, the occurrence of an exclusively Southern mtDNA lineage II and highly divergent FIVPle subtypes, FIVPle subtype D found only in Kru and subtype E exclusive to Bot-II, suggests that both East and Southern Africa were important refugia for lions during the Pleistocene. Therefore, the co-occurrence of divergent mtDNA haplotypes (6 to 10 mutations; Figure 1B and 1C) in southern populations may be the consequence of further isolation within refugia during colder climatic periods. Contemporary fragmentation of lion populations could further explain the results of nested-clade phylogeographical analysis (NCPA [27]) (Figure S5), which inferred restricted gene flow with isolation-by-distance between mtDNA haplotypes H9 (Bot-II) and H10 (Kru) (\u03c72 = 10.00, P = 0.0200), between haplotypes H1 (Bot-II/Nam) and H2 (Kru) (\u03c72 = 71.00, P\u22640.0001), and between haplotypes H9\u2013H10 (Bot-II/Kru) and haplotypes H11\u2013H12 (Bot-I/Kru/Ser/Ngc/Uga) (\u03c72 = 187.83, P\u22640.0001).",

Such result is confirmed here by lion genomic markers (Figure 2). Further, although lions within the Serengeti can be assigned to one of three populations (Ser-I, Ser-II or Ser-III) by host genomic markers, FIVPle subtypes are distributed ubiquitously in all three, characteristic of rapid horizontal retroviral transmission subsequent to host population admixture.

The first expansion, supported by the mtDNA NCPA [27] (\u03c72 = 690.00, P\u22640.0001; Figure S5), was a long-distance colonization of mtDNA lineage-III (Gir/Atl/Ang/Zbw) around 118,000 years ago (95% CI: 28,000\u2013208,000), with subsequent fragmentation of haplotypes H5\u2013H6 into Central and North Africa and haplotypes H7\u2013H8 into West Asia (M1- Figure 1A). Support for this initial expansion is also found in nDNA. The ADA haplotype A5 fixed in Gir in also present in Ken, Ser-II, and Ser-III, suggesting that lions likely colonized West Asia from the East Africa refugia (Figure 1B). Such an expansion may have been favored by the start of a warmer and less arid period in Africa 130,000\u201370,000 years ago [29]. This \u201cout-of-Africa event\u201d would have occurred much later than the initial lion expansion through Eurasia based on fossils (\u223c500,000 years ago) [3]. It is likely that multiple lion expansions occurred in the Pleistocene, as occurred with humans [21].",

This is reflected in the mtDNA linage IV, where haplotypes present in Southern lions are basal (older) to those found in the East. Overall, mtDNA population nucleotide diversity decreases from Southern to East Africa (Figure 1B and 1C), a finding supported by pairwise mismatch analysis [30] (raggedness, r = 0.086; P<0.001). The fixation of mtDNA haplotype H11 in Bot-I (otherwise fixed only in East Africa populations) suggests that the colonizing lions expanded northwards from the Kalahari Desert, which included bush, woodland and savannah habitats during the climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene [31]. This expansion would have occurred relatively recently as the single rare tip mtDNA haplotype H12, found only in Ser-I, is derived from the interior widespread haplotype H11 (\u223c14,000\u20137,000 years; given one mtDNA substitution every 7,000 years; Table 1). This expansion is also supported by FIVPle subtype A where haplotypes present in Southern lions (Kru and Bot-I) are basal to those found in the East (Ser-I, Ser-II and Ser-III) and a decrease of nucleotide-diversity of this FIVPle subtype is observed from Southern (\u03c0 = 0.15) to Eastern Africa (\u03c0 = 0.03) (Figure 3B). Interestingly, a similar northward colonization process from Southern Africa has been suggested for some of the lion preys, namely the impala, greater kudu, and wildebeest [32],[33].",

However, our population genomics data better fit a scenario of lion population expansion and interbreeding rather than simple replacement. First, genetic diversity and allelic richness at nDNA are slightly higher in East Africa populations relatively to those in Southern Africa. This is contrary to the expected pattern of population expansion in which there is usually a progressive decline in genetic diversity and allelic richness. Second, Ser lions carry two diverse FIVPle subtypes found only in East Africa (B\u2013C), and not only FIVPle subtype A, which was presumably introduced in East Africa coincidently with the mtDNA expansion event northwards from South. Third, the East African FIVPle subtype B found in Uga/Ser-I/Ser-II/Ser-III/Ngc showed evidence of a population expansion (raggedness, r = 0.004; P<0.01; F\ns = \u221220.37; P<0.00001) and the highest nucleotide diversity observed within FIVPle subtypes (\u03c0 = 0.09).

The extreme divergence among FIVPle subtypes, considered with high sero-prevalence in eight of the 11 lion populations, and combined with patterns of geographic concordance, support the hypothesis that FIVPle is not a recent emergence within modern lions [35]. Populations that harbor one private FIVPle subtype such Ken (subtype F), Bot-II (subtype E), and Kru (subtype D) must have been sufficiently isolated for enough time for the virus to evolve into unique subtypes, a result corroborated by the high nDNA and mtDNA genetic structure present in these lion populations (Figure 4). Thus, it is possible that the initial emergence of FIVPle pre-dates the Late-Pleistocene expansions of contemporary lion populations [36], but present day distributions are more useful indicators of very recent host population dynamics, a result also observed with FIVPco in a panmictic population of pumas in western North America [19].",

The very low population level of mtDNA nucleotide diversity, the number of haplotypes private to a single population (Figure 1), and probably also the lack of SRY genetic variation across all male lions (haplotype S1, n = 183) suggests that lion numbers diminished considerably following the Late Pleistocene.

Therefore, employing a bottom-up perspective that prioritizes populations, rather than large-scale units (e.g. all African lions), might preserve and maintain lion diversity and evolutionary processes most efficiently [41].",

Analyses of mtDNA in Panthera species are complicated by the presence of a 12.5 kb mtDNA integration into chromosome F2 [42]. Accordingly, mtDNA specific primers were designed for the 12S and 16S genes (Table S2) and we used long-range PCR amplification. We designed primers to amplify segments of the ADA (exon 10 and intron 10) and the TF (intron 3) genes (Table S2), two of the most variable protein loci in lion populations [5], localized on the domestic cat Felis catus chromosome A3p and C2q, respectively.

For haploid mtDNA data, each observed haplotype was coded with a unique integer (e.g. 100, 110) for the first allele and missing data for the second (Structure\n[22] analyses with or without the mtDNA data were essentially identical). For K population clusters, the program estimates the probability of the data, Pr(X|K), and the probability of individual membership in each cluster using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) within each cluster. Initial testing of the HWE in each of the populations defined by the geographic origin of sampling revealed no significant deviation from HW expectations with the exception of Ser and Bot population (later subdivided by Structure\n[22] in 3 and 2 clusters, respectively; such deviations from HW expectations were interpreted as evidence of further population structuring). We conducted six independent runs with K = 1\u201320 to guide an empirical estimate of the number of identifiable populations, assuming an admixture model with correlated allele frequencies and with burn-in and replication values set at 30,000 and 106, respectively. Structure also estimates allele frequencies of a hypothetical ancestral population and an alpha value that measures admixed individuals in the data set. The assignment of admixed individuals to populations using Structure\n[22] has been considered in subsequent population analyses. For each population cluster k, the program estimates F\nk, a quantity analogous to Wright's F\nST, but describing the degree of genetic differentiation of population k from the ancestral population.",

            "text": "Patterns of gene flow and divergence among populations were described using a variety of tests. First, to visualize subtle relationships among individual autosomal genotypes, three-dimensional factorial correspondence analyses [23] (FCA) were performed in Genetix\n[49], which graphically projects the individuals on the factor space defined by the similarity of their allelic states. Second, neighbor-joining (NJ) analyses implementing the Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards' chord genetic distance [56] (D\nCE) were estimated in Phylip 3.6 [57], and the tree topology support was assessed by 100 bootstraps. Third, the difference in average H\nO and A was compared among population groups using a two-sided test in Fstat 2.9.3.2 [58], which allows to assess the significance of the statistic OSx using 1,000 randomizations. Four, the equilibrium between drift and gene flow was tested using a regression of pairwise F\nST on geographic distance matrix among all populations for host nDNA(microsatellites)/mtDNA and FIVPle data. A Mantel test [59] was used to estimate the 95% upper probability for each matrix correlation. Assuming a stepping stone model of migration where gene flow is more likely between adjacent populations, one can reject the null hypothesis that populations in a region are at equilibrium if (1) there is a non-significant association between genetic and geographic distances, and/or (2) a scatterplot of the genetic and geographic distances fails to reveal a positive and monotonic relationship over all distance values of a region [60]. We also evaluated linearized F\nST [i.e. F\nST/(1\u2212F\nST)] [24] among populations. We tested two competing models of isolation-by-distance, one assuming the habitat to be arrayed in an infinite one-dimensional lattice and another assuming an infinite two-dimensional lattice. Both models showed that genetic differentiation increased with raw and log-transformed Euclidean distances, respectively [24]. We determined the confidence interval value of the slope of the regression for the nDNA data using a non parametric ABC bootstrap [61] in Genepop 4.0 [62].",

The NCPA started with the estimation of a 95% statistical parsimony [68] mtDNA network in Tcs 1.20 [69]. Tree ambiguities were further resolved using a coalescence criteria [70]. The network was converted into a series of nested branches (clades) [71],[72], which were then tested against their geographical locations through a permutational contingency analysis in GeoDis 2.2 [73]. The inferences obtained were also corroborated with the automated implementation of the NCPA in ANeCA [74]. To address potential weaknesses in some aspects of the NCPA analysis [75],[76], we further validated the NCPA inferences with independent methods for detecting restricted gene-flow/isolation-by-distance (using matrix correlation of pairwise F\nST and geographic distance) and population expansion (using pairwise mismatch distributions).",

The mtDNA TMRCA was estimated with a linearized tree method in Lintree\n[83] and using the equation H = 2\u03bcT, where H was the branch height (correlated to the average pairwise distance among haplotypes), \u03bc the substitution rate, and T the divergence time. Leopard and snow leopard (P. uncia) sequences were used as outgroups. Inference of the TMRCA for microsatellite loci followed Driscoll et al. [6] where the estimate of microsatellite variance in average allele repeat-size was used as a surrogate for evolutionary time based on the rate of allele range reconstitution subsequent to a severe founder effect.

Green squares represent captive individual samples to explore the relationship of lions from more isolated/endangered/depleted areas: ATL, Morocco Atlas lions (n = 4); ANG, Angola (n = 2); and ZBW, Zimbabwe (n = 1). Deduced historical expansions (M1 and M2) are represented by red arrows (see text). (B) Haplotype frequencies observed in the 11 lion populations for nDNA (ADA and TF), and mtDNA (12S\u201316S) genes, paralleled with the FIVPle serum-prevalence frequencies (black \u2013 sero-positive; gray \u2013 indeterminate; white \u2013 sero-negative). Population sample sizes are indicated within parenthesis. (C) Statistical parsimony networks of lion ADA, TF, and 12S\u201316S haplotypes. Circle size is proportional to the haplotype frequency and crossbars represent the number of step mutations connecting haplotypes. The mtDNA haplotypes H5 and H6 are shaded gray as they were detected only in the individual samples from ANG, ATL, and ZBW, which do not group in unique population clusters (see text).",
