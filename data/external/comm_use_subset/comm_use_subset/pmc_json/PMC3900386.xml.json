These methods probabilistically reconstruct likely transmission links between cases using data on the timing of symptoms and, where available, contact tracing data or other proximity information. The resulting transmission trees allow estimation of the number of secondary infections generated by each case, and thus of the transmission intensity (characterized by the reproduction number, R) over time. Pathogen genetic sequence data provides valuable additional information on potential transmission links between cases in a disease outbreak, particularly when reliable contact tracing data is not available. Indeed, using sequence data alone to estimate transmission rates during epidemics is increasingly frequent [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. As genetic sequences can now be obtained nearly in real-time [19], [20], this new source of information opens up exciting perspectives not only for understanding past outbreaks, but also for unraveling the transmission routes of ongoing outbreaks and subsequently adapting public health responses.",

            "text": "Integrated analysis of both epidemiological and sequence data clearly would maximize our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, but there are methodological and computational challenges. These challenges center on constructing and evaluating a unified likelihood for both the genetic and epidemiological data. One of the first attempts at integrated analysis [21] used phylogenetic trees to constrain the set of transmission trees then explored by an epidemiological transmission tree inference algorithm. An alternative approach [22] highlighted limitations of phylogenetic methods for reconstructing densely sampled outbreaks, and proposed an alternative graph theoretic approach for reconstructing \u2018genetically parsimonious\u2019 transmission trees, i.e. trees implying the smallest number of genetic changes amongst the sampled isolates. While simple and fast, this method also has a number of limitations: dates of infection are not inferred, the probability of a given transmission event cannot be assessed, and unobserved cases or multiple introductions of the disease cannot be detected. Substantive methodological developments have been made by Ypma et al.\n[23] and subsequently by Morelli et al.\n[24], both of which proposed unified likelihoods for genetic and epidemiological data to analyze livestock disease outbreaks (avian influenza H7N7 [23] and foot-and-mouth disease [24]). However, those methods require that the outbreak has a single introduction event and that all cases are observed, which limits their applicability to restricted epidemic contexts.",

We use the distribution of the generation time (i.e. time interval between a primary and a secondary infection) [7], [8] to define the epidemiological likelihood of a given transmission tree. This is coupled with a simple model of sequence evolution defining the probability of the genetic changes observed between the pathogen genomes along a chain of transmission. Our model is embedded within a Bayesian framework allowing estimation of dates of infections, mutation rates, separate introductions of the pathogen, the presence of unobserved cases, and the transmission tree. Estimate of the effective reproduction number over time, R(t), can also be obtained. As an improvement over previous approaches [23], [24], our method does not require all cases to be observed or there to be a single introduction event which triggers an outbreak. After evaluating the performance of our method using simulated outbreaks, we illustrate our approach by analyzing the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore [10], [11], [25]. Our method is implemented in the package \u2018outbreaker\u2019 for the R software [26] and represents the first widely available tool for the reconstruction and analysis of disease outbreaks from genomic data.",

In the absence of genetic information, the transmission tree was very difficult to infer (setting \u2018No mutation\u2019). Differences in basic reproduction numbers (settings \u2018Low R\u2019 and \u2018High R\u2019) and in the shape of the generation time distribution (settings \u2018Short generation\u2019 and \u2018Long generation\u2019) induced some variation in the proportions of successfully recovered ancestries, although these remained satisfying in every case (Fig. 1 and Table S1 in Text S1). Dates of infections were inferred with accuracy in most settings (Fig. S2 and Table S1 in Text S1). However, this result was mostly driven by the shape of the generation time distribution, with broader distributions leading to greater uncertainty in the dates of infection (Fig. S2). While perfectly inferred in fully sampled outbreaks, the number of generations between ancestor and descendents became ambiguous as the proportion of missing cases increases (Table S1 in Text S1). Mutation rates were also mostly well estimated (Table S1 in Text S1, Fig. S3), albeit with a tendency to over-estimation. This bias was stronger when sampling grew sparser (settings with 75% and 50% missing cases), and to a lesser extent when the number of imported cases grew large (setting \u2018Many imports\u2019). Detailed investigation of individual simulations suggested that misdetection of imported cases and increased numbers of erroneous ancestries may be responsible for over-estimating the mutation rates in these settings. The inference of sampling coverage varied largely amongst different simulation settings (Table S1 in Text S1, Fig. S4): well recovered in fully sampled outbreaks, it was largely overestimated in sparse samples (settings with 75%, 50% and 25% missing cases), and slightly underestimated with longer generation time.",

To assess whether our approach could detect such heterogeneity, we implemented two types of simulations in which there were systematic differences in infectivity between groups of hosts. In a first set of simulations, the host population was divided into two groups of equal sizes (e.g. adults and children) with low and high infectivity (infectivity in one group was twice that of the other group, with equal susceptibility). In the second setting, we included rare (5%) super-spreaders, who had the same susceptibility to infections as non super-spreaders, but were 13-fold more infectious. In both sets of simulations, infectivity was fixed for each individual at the beginning of the simulations.

Using this result, we performed a simple graph analysis to derive possible clusters of direct transmissions, which suggested the existence of one main cluster of cases that may be linked directly, the remaining 4 isolates falling into three groups (Fig. S15).

Closer examination of the patterns of mutations between Sin2500, Sin2748 and Sin2679 bring further support to this scenario (Fig. 6, Data S3). Indeed, the four mutations separating Sin2500 from Sin2679 are the simple addition of the mutations accumulated on the chain of transmission, from Sin2500 to Sin2748 (position 26,430: a\u2192g), and from Sin2748 to Sin2679 (18,284: c\u2192a; 19,086: t\u2192c; 23,176: c\u2192t).",

Our method is also the first tool for outbreak reconstruction widely available as a free software (the R package \u2018outbreaker\u2019) and able to run on standard desktop computers. The analysis of simulated data suggests that our approach will be applicable to a wide range of pathogens with various basic reproduction numbers, generation time distributions, and genetic diversity. We have shown how our approach can be used to infer effective reproduction numbers at an individual level. Importantly, this allows for detecting differences in infectivity of different groups of cases, and for the identification of super-spreaders. Our results suggest that while epidemiological data may suffice for the estimation of mean aggregated quantities such as the mean effective reproduction number, R, genetic data are useful to tease individual heterogeneities apart.",

We note that our framework could easily be extended to model the uninfected population. This could be done by modifying our likelihood so that the probability of the time of infection of a case would be based on an explicit model of the force of infection; individuals not infected during the outbreak would also contribute to the epidemiological likelihood as is standard in such situations [4]. Integrating and validating these additional features in our approach will be the subject of future research.",

While the reconstruction of transmission tree seems relatively robust to large proportions of unobserved cases (up to 75% of missing cases, Fig. 1), our method is clearly tailored to densely sampled outbreaks, and not meant for the analysis of large-scale, more sparsely sampled epidemics. In such cases, phylogenetic methods are preferred as they explicitly reconstruct unobserved common ancestors of the sampled pathogen genomes, and can be used to infer, if not the transmission tree, the past dynamics of the disease [30], [31], [32].",

While this method should be useful to detect separate introductions of different pathogenic lineages in an epidemic, it may be sensitive to other events prone to creating genetic outliers, such as sequencing errors or recombination. Care should therefore be devoted to ensuring data quality and filtering out polymorphism due to recombination. Moreover, the assumption that imported cases are genetically distinguishable from other cases may not always be true, especially when multiple introductions take place from a closely related lineage. Such cases cannot be detected by genetic data only, and would require other sources of information (e.g. contact tracing) to be considered. In this respect, an interesting feature of outbreaker is the ability to fix known imported cases (as well as any other known transmissions) before reconstructing the transmission tree.",

In this case, a conservative approach should allow for a wide range of possible times to infection, at the expense of increased uncertainty in the inferred ancestries.

Limited host diversity leads us to assume that genomes sampled from infectors are effectively ancestral to genomes sampled from secondary cases, allowing us to equate phylogenetic and transmission trees. This substantially reduces the complexity of the inferential problem, and reduces by orders of magnitude the dimensionality of the space of linked augmented variables to be explored. The assumption of no within-host diversity will likely be appropriate for acute infectious pathogens in outbreaks, but will also be relatively appropriate for situations where there is a strong bottleneck on diversity upon transmission and limited opportunities for superinfection, such as sexually transmitted HIV. Inclusion of within-host diversity in the model inference is an important but likely complex task, though efficient approximations may be possible. A related development will be the inclusion of multiple samples per individual, used to sample cross-sectional and longitudinal genetic diversity within infected hosts. Another somewhat simpler extension would be the inclusion of a \u2018relaxed\u2019 molecular clock, which would allow accounting for heterogeneities in mutation rates amongst different pathogen lineages.",

Conversely, fixing the mutation rate to its \u2018true\u2019 value (or a good estimate thereof) is likely to improve the detection of imported cases. As currently implemented, our method allows for fixing any parameter as well as individual ancestries, which are used in the likelihood computations but not changed during the MCMC. This feature should be especially useful for incorporating known transmission events or introductions of the pathogen into the population, based for instance on clinical investigations and contact tracing information.

As a workaround, we can re-estimate a classical mutation rate from the distribution of posterior trees. The mutation rate can be inferred from one transmission event as the ratio of the number of mutations from ancestor to descendent and the amount of time separating the infection dates of these cases. For each tree, we compute the average mutation rate across all ancestries, which provides one estimate of the mutation rate for each posterior sample.
