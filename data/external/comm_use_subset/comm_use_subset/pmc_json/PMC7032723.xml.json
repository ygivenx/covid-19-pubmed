While it is intuitive that transcriptional changes in the nucleus impact RNA levels in the cytoplasm, evidence in both yeast and mammalian cells now indicates that the converse is also true: altered cytoplasmic mRNA decay rates can broadly impact transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) [1]. In yeast, stabilizing the cytoplasmic mRNA pool by removing mRNA decay factors such as Xrn1 causes a compensatory decrease in Pol II transcription [2\u20136]. Furthermore, reducing or slowing Pol II transcription leads to an increase in overall mRNA stability [2], supporting a \u201cbuffering\u201d model in which yeast can compensate for widespread perturbations to mRNA abundance by alternatively changing rates of decay or transcription.",

Numerous viruses, including alphaherpesviruses, gammaherpesviruses, vaccinia virus, SARS and MERS coronavirus and influenza A virus drive accelerated mRNA decay during infection by expressing mRNA specific ribonucleases and/or by activating host nucleases. This decay contributes to viral immune evasion, increases the availability of host translation machinery, and facilitates temporal viral gene regulation [7\u201311]. Viral endonucleases target host and viral mRNAs for cleavage, whereupon cellular exonucleases degrade the resulting mRNA fragments [12\u201316]. This strategy accelerates basal RNA decay by circumventing the typically rate limiting steps of deadenylation and decapping [17\u201321].",

However, studies with mammalian RNA-decay inducing viruses and viral nucleases have revealed that accelerated mRNA decay is not broadly counteracted by increased transcription-based repopulation, but instead leads to a more extensive shutdown of cellular gene expression. Infection with the gammaherpesviruses KSHV or MHV68 causes reduced Pol II occupancy at individually tested host promoters in a manner dependent on mRNA cleavage by the viral endonucleases SOX or muSOX [22,23]. In uninfected cells expressing muSOX, this Pol II repression phenotype is linked to differential trafficking of RNA binding proteins (RBP) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [23]. RBP trafficking is thought to occur upon their release from mRNA during the act of transcript degradation, which is initiated by muSOX and completed by cellular exonucleases including Xrn1. It is possible that this altered RBP distribution in cells is interpreted as a stress signal related to pathogenesis, leading to transcriptional dampening rather than the compensatory increase that occurs in other gene regulatory contexts [1].",

            "text": "MHV68 mRNAs are also susceptible to cleavage by muSOX during infection [24]. However, measurements of nascent transcript production from a subset of viral promoters suggested that viral genes are robustly transcribed during the stage of infection when host transcription is reduced [25]. An outstanding question is how these viral promoters escape mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression despite being transcribed by host Pol II. Here, we measured Pol II occupancy across the mouse and MHV68 genomes in infected cells to more comprehensively define how accelerated mRNA decay impacts polymerase occupancy. Our data demonstrate a genome-wide reduction in Pol II occupancy at host promoters under conditions of increased mRNA decay. However, this phenotype was not reversed upon depletion of cellular exonucleases, suggesting that additional mechanisms contribute to transcriptional repression during infection. Indeed, measurements of global proteome changes by mass spectrometry revealed an mRNA decay-linked decrease in nuclear levels of several transcription factors including key Pol II subunits, which likely contributes to the impact of MHV68 infection on host transcription. Notably, Pol II occupancy of the viral genome appears broadly resistant to the effects of mRNA degradation, despite the change in nuclear levels of Pol II. This protection is not conferred by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the replicating viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which DNA amplified in viral replication compartments, unlike the cellular chromatin, is not subject to transcriptional repression during accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA decay. Thus, while both viral and cellular mRNA pools are susceptible to cytoplasmic degradation, transcriptional repopulation selectively counteracts this loss for viral genes.",

            "text": "We previously reported that Pol II occupancy at several individual mammalian promoters was significantly reduced during accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA decay [23,25]. To more comprehensively assess the extent of mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression, we evaluated global Pol II occupancy by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in mock versus MHV68 infected MC57G mouse fibroblasts at 24 hours post infection (hpi), which is near the end of the infectious cycle [26]. As a control, we also infected cells with a version of MHV68 containing the point mutation R443I in the viral muSOX endonuclease gene, which reduces its mRNA cleavage activity. MHV68 R443I replicates similarly to WT MHV68 in cultured mouse fibroblasts and in the lungs of infected mice, although it displays in vivo defects in viral trafficking to distal sites and latency establishment [7]. MHV68-infected cells showed promoter-proximal loss of Pol II at 86% of loci compared to mock-infected cells, averaged across two biological replicates and subtracting input signal from Pol II occupancy counts from -50 to +200 around the transcription start site (TSS) (Fig 1A and S1A Fig). Loss of Pol II occupancy was primarily due to muSOX-induced mRNA decay, as this signal loss either did not occur or was reduced at 67% of these loci during infection with R443I MHV68 (Fig 1B and S1B Fig). Sixty-three genes, or 1.3% of loci, showed higher Pol II occupancy in WT infection as compared to mock infection, although these did not share any common gene ontology (GO) terms. A representative genome browser view shows reduced Pol II signal throughout Srsf2 in the MHV68 condition of two replicate ChIP experiments (Fig 1C). The variability between replicates in R443I recovery (Fig 1C) is likely due to differences in the extent of host shutoff reduction between replicates, as R443I reduces muSOX activity but it is not a catalytic mutant. We validated the ChIP-seq results by ChIP-qPCR at the Rplp0 and Fus promoters, both of which showed a significant reduction of Pol II occupancy in cells infected with WT but not R443I MHV68 (Fig 1D). We used a second antibody that recognizes the N-terminus of the major subunit of Pol II, Rpb1, to control for potential bias in the phosphorylation state of the CTD recognized by the ChIP-seq antibody, 8WG16 [27]. We saw a similar decrease in Pol II levels at the promoter with both antibodies as well as a decrease in the Rplp0 gene body Pol II occupancy with the antibody recognizing the Rpb1 N-terminus upon MHV68 infection (Fig 1D, S1C Fig).",

Consistent with the above analyses, MHV68 infected cells contained less promoter proximal Pol II than uninfected cells, and this signal was partially recovered in the R443I infection (Fig 1E). Genes with reduced Pol II promoter binding during MHV68 infection also had less Pol II within the gene body compared to mock infected cells, which again was not observed during R443I infection (Fig 1F). Notably, the difference in regression line slopes between MHV68 and mock infected cells was more marked when comparing Pol II promoter occupancy, suggesting that the primary transcriptional defect is at the stages of recruitment and initiation. This is consistent with data from previous studies that found no defect in serine 2 phosphorylation of elongating Pol II and no consistent change to Pol II elongation during MHV68 infection [23,25].",

We previously showed that accelerated mRNA decay by the coordinated activity of muSOX and Xrn1 causes RNA binding protein relocalization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and that this relocalization plays a role in transcriptional repression in 293T cells [23]. We therefore performed a similar experiment in infected cells, in which each sample was separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and proteins from each fraction were labeled with isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT). We then multiplexed these TMT labeled fractions and subjected them to quantitative liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) (Figs 3A and S2A, S1 Table). In agreement with our previous findings [23], we observed the expected increase in nuclear levels of the RNA binding proteins PABPC1 and LARP4 in cells infected with WT MHV68 compared to mock or R443I infected cells (Fig 3B).",

We examined classes of proteins that increased or decreased in a host shutoff dependent manner in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (S2 B-D). Notably, RNA Polymerase II activity-associated proteins were substantially decreased in WT MHV68 infection compared to R443I or mock cells (Fig 3C). The nucleus-specific changes included decreased levels of 7 subunits of Pol II, the general transcription factor (GTF) TFIIB, and the large subunit of the GTF TFIIA (Fig 3D). The lack of a corresponding increase in the cytoplasmic levels of Pol II subunits suggests that muSOX activity decreased their overall abundance rather than changing their localization (Figs 3E and S2D). We confirmed this hypothesis by measuring the abundance of several of these proteins by western blotting whole cell lysates across a time course of WT and R443I MHV68 infection in MC57G cells (Fig 3F). WT MHV68 infection reduced the levels of Pol II subunits Polr2a (Rpb1), Polr2b (Rpb2) and Gtf2B (TFIIB) beginning at 20 hpi. In contrast, levels of the GTF TATA Binding Protein (TBP) are not decreased in either the TMT dataset or in the western blotting experiments (Fig 3F, S1 Table). R443I virus infection showed relatively constant levels of Rpb1, Rpb2, TFIIB and TBP across the time course (Fig 3F). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that muSOX-induced mRNA degradation during MHV68 infection causes both RNA binding protein relocalization and depletion of multiple components of the cellular transcriptional machinery. It is likely that this combination of phenotypes contributes to the broad reduction in Pol II occupancy at host promoters.",

We therefore analyzed Pol II occupancy of the viral genome in WT MHV68 and R443I infected cells to determine how viral genes respond to RNA decay in light of the decrease in Pol II subunits. The average Pol II signature across 82 viral ORFs between -500 and +500 around the transcription start site was comparable in cells infected with WT or R443I MHV68, with a slightly higher signal in the R443I infection (Fig 4A). Indeed, as shown in the genome browser of a representative genomic region, there was a robust and widespread Pol II signal in both infection conditions (Fig 4B). To determine if transcription from the viral genome was affected by host shutoff, we pulse labeled WT MHV68 and R443I infected cells with 4-thiouridine (4SU) for 10 min to measure nascent transcript levels. 4SU gets incorporated into actively transcribing mRNAs and can be subsequently coupled to MTSEA -biotin and purified over streptavidin beads [59]. For the 7 transcripts we measured, we saw no statistically significant difference in nascent transcription comparing WT to R443I (S3 Fig), consistent with our Pol II ChIP-seq results. Thus, herpesviral genes appear to escape mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression.",

            "text": "We next considered how the viral genome maintains high levels of Pol II occupancy during accelerated mRNA decay. During replication, viral DNA is transcribed within viral replication compartments (RCs) in the nucleus, which exclude host DNA and thus stain poorly with DAPI [31\u201333]. Although they are not membrane bound, these compartments selectively enrich for factors required for viral replication (such as the viral processivity factor ORF59) and gene expression (such as Pol II) [34\u201336]. Virus-induced mRNA decay causes increased trafficking of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (see Fig 3B), which has been linked to transcriptional repression [23,37]. To determine whether replication compartments selectively exclude nuclear PABPC as a means of avoiding transcriptional repression, we monitored its localization in cells lytically infected with MHV68 or KSHV. As expected, the majority of infected cells displayed increased nuclear PABPC compared to unreactivated or uninfected cells as measured by immunofluorescence (IF). However, PABPC did not appear to be excluded from replication compartments (Fig 5A and 5B and S4 Fig). To confirm PABPC localization relative to RCs, we first identified cells with RCs by looking for nuclear regions containing Pol II or ORF59 that also showed reduced DAPI staining. We then quantified nuclear PABPC pixel intensity, and counted cells as having an overlapping RC/PABPC signal when the PABPC pixel intensity was at least 2x that of cells without nuclear PABPC from the same image. Indeed, 85 percent of MHV68 infected cells showed overlapping PABPC/Pol II signal and 90 percent of reactivated iSLKs showed an overlapping PABPC/ORF59 signal (Fig 5C). Thus, PABPC exclusion from RCs is unlikely to underlie viral promoter escape.",

To test this, we measured the Pol II occupancy and transcriptional potential of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression on the MHV68 genome. Unlike alpha- and gammaherpesviruses, the betaherpesvirus CMV does not accelerate mRNA decay. Furthermore, in either a plasmid context or when integrated into 293T cells, the CMV promoter is strongly repressed during muSOX-induced mRNA decay, similar to host genes. This was seen upon measurement of nascent RNA production by 4SU pulse labeling in muSOX-expressing cells (Fig 7A, ActB shown for reference) [23]. We also observed repression of the CMV promoter driving puromycin resistance integrated into the host chromatin during infection by measuring Pol II occupancy using ChIP (Fig 7B). However, in the context of the replicating MHV68 genome, the CMV promoter driving GFP had a Pol II ChIP-seq signal during both MHV68 WT and R443I infection that was not markedly different from several other viral genes (ORFs 4, 25, 48, 52, 72, M11) (Fig 7C).",

To this end, we measured Pol II occupancy at promoters of several genes expressed from the KSHV genome during latent infection in 293T cells, when the viral DNA is maintained as an episome but not amplified in replication compartments. Latent infection does not promote mRNA turnover, and thus we transfected muSOX into these cells to stimulate mRNA turnover in the absence of lytic replication. Similar to the host genes Gapdh and Rplp0, we observed an RNA decay-induced repression of Pol II occupancy at the latent viral promoter LANA while the viral K1 promoter was repressed in 4 out of 5 experiments (Fig 7D). We also observed repression of the human Ef1\u03b1 promoter, which is present on the KSHV viral episome as a driver of the GFP reporter gene (Fig 7D). In sum, these observations indicate that the viral genome per se does not confer protection from transcriptional repression; instead, features linked to lytic genome amplification in replication compartments facilitate robust Pol II recruitment under conditions of accelerated mRNA turnover.",

Using an unbiased TMT-based proteomics approach, we reveal that infection with MHV68 causes RNA decay-dependent changes in the abundance of numerous cellular proteins with roles in Pol II transcription, including depletion of 7 of the 12 Pol II subunits, all of which are specific to Pol II and not shared by Pol I or III. The TMT findings underscore how a multitude of alterations to protein localization and abundance likely shape the gene expression environment during infection, and further highlight the ripple effects of accelerating mRNA decay. Notably, promoters on the replicating viral genome recruit Pol II with similar efficiency during normal or accelerated mRNA decay, indicating that they escape transcriptional inhibition and overcome the decrease in Pol II and transcription factor subunits. This protection is lost upon relocation of the viral promoters into the host genome or when the viral genome is in a latent state, emphasizing the importance of DNA context and replication state, rather than promoter sequence, in determining the transcriptional response to infection.",

Thus, at least two events contribute to mRNA decay-linked transcriptional repression: relocalization of RNA binding proteins such as PABPC to the nucleus upon degradation of muSOX-cleaved RNAs [23,25], and depletion of key transcriptional components during infection. The fact that knockdown of Xrn1 or Dis3L2 does not rescue Pol II occupancy during WT MHV68 infection indicates that either these mechanisms are redundant, or that the Pol II depletion phenotype is dominant. The mechanism underlying reduced Pol II occupancy upon protein relocalization remains unknown, but one hypothesis is that aberrant accumulation of RNA binding proteins in the nucleus is sensed as a cellular stress signal that causes the cell to reduce its gene expression [1,23]. While both phenotypes are observed during MHV68 infection, it is interesting that GTF and Pol II subunit depletion does not occur during muSOX-induced mRNA decay in the absence of infection [23]. Instead, other downstream effects of host shutoff, such as infection-specific relocalization of RBPs, or host shutoff dependent changes to viral protein levels, could result in these changes to a key category of proteins.",

This is supported by the TMT-MS data, which shows a decrease in the GTFs TFIIB and the large subunit of TFIIA that are key to formation of the preinitiation complex. The reduction in promoter-proximal Pol II is propagated into the gene body, although the differences there were less pronounced, suggesting that once transcription of a gene initiates there are not subsequent blocks to elongation. This agrees with prior studies of individual host loci in MHV68 infected or muSOX expressing cells [23,25]. The population of promoter-proximal Pol II detected by ChIP comprises a combination of actively engaged Pol II as well as Pol II transiently binding to the DNA. Thus, a large reduction in promoter-proximal Pol II may not be expected to be fully borne out in the gene body [42]. That said, we did note a robust decrease of Pol II in the Rplp0 gene body of MHV68 infected cells when we used an antibody recognizing the N-terminus of Rpb1. It is therefore possible that the modest reduction in Pol II across gene bodies observed in the ChIP-seq using the 8WG16 antibody from MHV68 infected cells may underestimate the magnitude of the gene body decreases. We did not observe a defect in transcription termination, or evidence of polymerases on the DNA after TTSs, suggesting that MHV68 does not induce the termination defect and run-on transcription of host genes that occurs during infection with HSV-1 [43].",

Furthermore, early data showed that while the endogenous mouse \u03b2-globin locus was transcriptionally repressed during HSV-1 infection, its expression was rescued upon integration of the \u03b2-globin gene into the HSV-1 genome [46,47]. Experiments with gene-specific null viruses have implicated immediate early (IE) proteins in the HSV-1 transcriptional repression phenotype, including ICP27, which can accelerate mRNA turnover [45,48].

These non-membrane bound structures are sites of viral genome replication, transcription, and packaging [49]. They are enriched for many host and viral proteins involved in these processes, including chromatin modifying factors and Pol II [34\u201336]. Replication compartments grow and coalesce during infection, excluding host chromatin, which becomes pushed to the nuclear periphery [31\u201333]. Previous analyses of cellular protein distribution by mass spectrometry revealed that muSOX and Xrn1-coordinated mRNA decay causes differential trafficking of many cellular RNA binding proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus. At least one of these proteins, PABPC, was shown to be associated with transcriptional repression [23]. Here, in addition to observing increased PABPC in the nucleus of infected cells, we also detected PABPC in viral replication compartments. This indicates that while PABPC relocalizes to infected nuclei in a RNA decay-dependent manner, selective exclusion of PABPC from these compartments is not the mechanism by which the viral genome escapes repression. Instead, we hypothesize that either the state of viral DNA or other protective features of the replication compartment confers escape from transcriptional repression.",

Notably, during latency key lytic promoters like RTA contain both the activating H3K4me3 and the repressive H3K27me3 histone marks, representing a \u2018poised\u2019 state [53]. Rapid changes shortly after lytic cycle induction result in hypomethylation and removal of repressive marks at early gene promoters [50,53]. At later stages of infection, KSHV, EBV and HSV-1 genomes have been shown to be largely nucleosome free, consistent with histones not being packaged in virions [33,35,54,55]. For gammaherpesviruses, this is the stage at which mRNA degradation is most pronounced. We therefore hypothesize that the \u2018open\u2019 state of viral DNA during lytic replication plays an important role in facilitating Pol II recruitment under conditions of accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA decay and may in fact be sufficient to explain the robust recruitment of Pol II to replication compartments. It is possible that the open state of the DNA, particularly late in infection, also contributes to the relatively uniform occupancy of Pol II across MHV68 genes and absence of clear promoter-proximal peaks. It will be interesting to investigate if the general chromatin state of the host genome also changes in infection or if is largely the lack of chromatinization of the viral genome that is driving these changes.",

We hypothesize that the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the open conformation of viral DNA in replication compartments, and that this helps these viruses counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss and overcome depletion of Pol II and general transcription factor protein subunits. Future work is geared towards exploring whether widespread mRNA decay alters cellular chromatin states and DNA accessibility and, if so, how this influences transcription factor recruitment.",

DNA was purified using a Zymo Oligo Clean & Concentrator kit, and quantified by qPCR using primers to the promoter regions of indicated genes for 50 cycles. qPCR was simultaneously performed on input chromatin and normalized to input. Raw percent input values are normalized by setting mock infected or a transfection control to 1 and are plotted as relative % input. IgG pull downs were performed with the MHV68 infected sample under scramble conditions, or the muSOX or SOX transfected sample for transfection experiments.",

A fully tryptic search against a mouse Uniprot database appended with MHV68 and common contaminant sequences (downloaded 10/2016\u201317,149 sequences) requiring 5 ppm mass accuracy on the precursor ions and 0.02 Da accuracy on the fragment ions was performed. Static carbamidomethyl modifications to cysteine, static TMT additions to peptide N-termini and lysine residues, dynamic oxidation of methionine, dynamic deamidation of asparagine, dynamic methionine loss and acetylation of protein n-termini, and dynamic phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine were allowed as modifications in the search. Matched spectra were scored by Percolator and reporter ion signal-to-noise values were extracted. Following parsimonious protein assembly at a 1% FDR for proteins and peptides, reporter ion quantitation was performed for unique and razor peptides with an average S/N of at least 10 and a precursor co-isolation threshold of less than 30% which did not contain a variable modification and normalized to the total detected signal in each TMT channel. Protein abundances were calculated as the sum of all reporter ion values in a particular channel for each protein. Imputation of missing values was performed by low abundance resampling. The data were scaled based on the Mock infection samples (channels 126 and 129). Statistically differential proteins were assessed via the background based t-test analysis implemented in Proteome Discoverer. The resulting data was exported to Excel for further analysis.
