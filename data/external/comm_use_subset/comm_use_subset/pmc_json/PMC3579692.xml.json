Recent outbreaks of highly communicable diseases\n[7,12-15] have triggered a marked rise in the number of studies on infectious disease transmissions\n[16], with equal amount of attention on the mechanisms of global disease spread\n[3,8,17], and at the regional scale of within countries or cities\n[4-7,13,18-21]. Only limited research, however, was reported at the micro scale, such as in the environment exemplified by a relatively closed campus, small community, school, residential, or hospital buildings with a few exceptions\n[22,23].",

An infectious disease typically spreads via contact between infected and susceptible individuals in their overlapped activity spaces. Therefore, daily mobility-activity information can be used as an indicator to measure exposures to risk factors of infection. A major difficulty and thus the reason for paucity of studies of infectious disease transmission at the micro scale in the past was the lack of detailed individual mobility and exposure data. Since the records of small-scale movements and contacts between people were generally not available with only a few exceptions\n[22,23,28,29], studies of infectious disease were often aggregates in space and time\n[5].",

Global positioning systems (GPS), mobile communications, and wireless network make possible the tracking of human and object movements, generating large amounts of data with unprecedented quality and timeliness at relatively low cost. Applications of these technologies started to flourish in transportation research\n[38], retail studies\n[35], human ecology\n[36], and more recently, health related studies\n[27,39-54]. Examples of health related studies include investigating human mobility affected by diseases or surgeries or in young or aged populations\n[39-46], studying physical activity and the environment\n[48-51], and defining specific geographic contexts\n[52,53] or an operational \u201cneighbourhood\u201d in place-based health studies\n[54]. Kwan\n[52,53] has suggested that examining space-time activity spaces of individuals can lead to more accurate exposure measures. A couple of studies have attempted to track exposures to health risk factors related to human movement\n[27,47], with one targeting infectious disease but the focus was on vector-borne disease only.",

A-GPS uses not only satellite signals, but also cellular network resources to locate and use the satellites in poor signal conditions. Satellite signals can be weak due to dense buildings in an urban environment, tree canopy in a wooded area, or poor atmospheric conditions. In such case, A-GPS uses data from a cellular network to obtain faster fix times than standalone GPS. Fix time can be reduced from minutes to seconds and thus leads to more-accurate trip detection\n[49]. This is particular useful for tracking long durations when objects move both indoors and outdoors, as outdoor locations can be immediately picked up upon exiting from an indoor location.",

One of the objectives of this study is to explore the potential of such technology to be used in the study of infectious disease transmission. To date, there are only a limited number of studies of human mobility in relation to disease transmission at the micro scale\n[27-29]. One of the studies used GPS to track human mobility\n[27] while the other two relied on traditional activity questionnaires\n[28,29]. The focus of these studies has been limited to vector-borne diseases. Vector-borne disease depends largely on spatial patterns of vector abundances and can thus be readily evaluated. In case of directly transmitted infectious disease, the risk is not known because the disease carriers engage in dynamic space-time activities themselves. Therefore, risk patterns could only be modelled by examining overlapping of space-time activity spaces of individuals and may possibly inferred by comparing the space-time behaviours of those infected with those of a control group during an outbreak. Therefore, daily mobility-activity information obtained from GPS tracking can be used as an indicator to measure exposures to risk factors of infection.",

It is thus difficult to develop analysis techniques to extract meaningful abstractions from the raw data. Visualization has been suggested to be particularly suitable for dealing with such data when conventional inferential statistics and pattern recognition algorithms fail due to the complex attributes involved\n[33,59,61].

It shows that student A and C sat in the same classroom for a class period (co-existence in terms of a static bundle). A and B walked by each other without more interaction (point co-existence) but met again later and walked along (co-existence in terms of a dynamic bundle). B and C never had direct interaction but the fact that C (and A) used the same classroom after B left from an earlier class makes it a situation called co-location. In the context of disease transmission, both dynamic bundles and static bundles are highly relevant, whereas point bundles and co-location beyond the lifespan of an airborne virus can be less important.",

Therefore, although STC has been suggested as an effective tool in epidemiological research examples have been limited to large-scale dispersions of identified cases. In this pilot study, we collected detailed outdoor trajectories and inferred indoor stays through spatiotemporal processing of the data collected with an A-GPS. Approximated indoor stays cannot be as precise to specific locations inside a building. Thus we are not able to examine the actual human to human transmission patterns, but only rough estimates of risk patterns indicated by the overlapping of approximated space-time activity spaces of individuals.

Previous research has addressed the problem with various filtering algorithms, such as though Gaussian Kernel smoothing or using a modified Kalman filter\n[49]. These filtering algorithms are general smoothing approaches used to reduce random errors in the data. Visual examination of the A-GPS trajectory data collected in our study reveals distinct patterns of errors resulting mostly from indoor stays. Such errors may be easily identified by overlaying the trajectory data with a detailed building layer and manually removed by selecting the erroneous track points.

It is noted that some portion of the trajectory close to a campus building appears to be noisy (indicated by the spiky portion of the track). This is caused by weak GPS signals around and inside buildings. The spike can sometimes reach very far due to the low-accuracy of positioning when the device is indoors. We employed the automatic pre-processing algorithm on the raw data and conducted spatiotemporal segmentation. Figure\n3b shows the pre-processed trajectory and Figure\n3c displays the segmented trajectory with color-coded indoor and outdoor segments in the space-time cube with reference to photo imagery and campus buildings.

The A-GPS device we used, the Worldtracker GPRS, has a 15 hour battery life that enables the recording of an entire daytime trajectory with a simple plug-in charging at night. It also is not limited in data storage as the data transmits to the data server immediately via a cellular network. All three devices were reported to have similar spatial accuracies. The A-GPS, however, has the coarsest temporal resolution (15 seconds) among the three devices tested. These have resulted slightly more generalized trajectories in time-space as indicated by the red trajectory in Figure\n4b.",

Among the 30 trajectory-diary pairs, ten were excluded from our analysis as they either contain incomplete diary records (missing time periods in between records), very short or even no on-campus stays (less than 2 hours), or missing A-GPS signal (one A-GPS was out of battery in the middle of a recording due to forgotten charging). From the diary data, a total number of 55 indoor stays on campus with a total length of 63.15 hours were recorded. The pre-processed and segmented A-GPS trajectories captured 57 indoor stays with a total length of 65.40 hours. Two indoor stays described in the diary were missing from the trajectory data, while the later captured 4 more segments that were not recorded in the diary. The mismatch between the two sets of data could be due to errors in either the segmented trajectory data or the diary data or both. By examining the mismatches and interviewing students who participated in the study we found that one of the two \u201cmiss\u201des by the trajectory data lasted only 2 minutes and the other happened after a long-stay in a dorm building when the device probably has suffered from a slow fix time. It has also occurred to us that the diary takers may not have often recorded activities as soon as they happened but wrote their diaries out of memory when time allowed. As a result they often recorded down a rough estimate of time and some activities could be completely missing as such skipped their memories.",

At the same time, an attempt to remediate the problem exercised in this study was to examine student behaviour by deriving attributes associated with a particular type of activity instead of the specific location-activity.

Handheld GPS supports the most temporal details but needs intervention for long durations of data collection. iPhone and the Worldtracker GPRS are both A-GPS based devices. However, the added indoor tracking ability does not lead to improvement as the cellular network positioning accuracy could be 50 meters or greater depending on the density of available cellular network. The battery life of the iPhone device is of the most concern in this experiment but new generations of the smart phone and better apps could improve significantly on this aspect. The Worldtracker GPRS employed in this study generates the coarsest trajectories but is the most user-friendly that doesn\u2019t require any user intervention except for night charging. It also supports long duration of tracking as there is no limit of data storage. Comparison to diary data indicated that the trajectory data captured with the GPRS was able to approximate major patterns in students\u2019 on-campus activities, and the 15 second time-interval still provides much finer temporal resolution than the traditional diary data could record.",

Densities are also found to be slightly higher at the dormitory and at the departmental building clusters as shown at locations B and C in Figure\n6. The departmental building cluster is home to three departments in the college of natural sciences that lie very close to each other and are connected by indoor pathways, although in separate buildings. Some preliminary speculations on the cause of this pattern include that on one side, the science students who take classes in these buildings tend to stay indoors for a long period of time. On another side, deriving from the temporal hotspot patterns in Figure\n6, these buildings tend to be crowded especially in late afternoon or evening. The university class schedule indicates that classes scheduled in this time are often double periods-taking as long as 2 hour 45 minutes, leading to, again, prolonged indoor stay time. Further investigation, however, needs to be conducted to determine the exact causes of such clustering. This experiment indicates that the method has the potential to reveal hidden space-time activity patterns that may give insights to flu transmission at the micro-scale.",

Figure\n8a shows all straight line connections among buildings captured by the participating students and the highlighted buildings are those with the highest outbound traffic volumes. Figure\n8b illustrates the most trafficked connections (bold lines). It shows strong connections among the same group of departmental buildings identified as hotspots in density surface visualization. Strong connections also exist between this group of departmental buildings (with Science building being the centre) and the UC, and between the UC and the Center of Academic Success (CAS), a building that has undergraduate advisement offices and classrooms. Figure\n9 shows the connection analysis results for only students who had been sick. Comparing Figure\n9 to Figure\n8, we see that one strong connection (between the UC and the CAS building) is no longer present from the set of strong connections identified for sick students only. The two strong connections that remain are one between the UC and the departmental buildings and another among the departmental buildings. The UC is the most heavily trafficked stop on campus being the main recreation centre where the cafeteria, book store, and recreation rooms are located. It was hypothesized as a potential high risk hub during flu season when students interact with each for a long period of time in a crowded space. The departmental buildings involved in the second connection are all attached to each other with indoor pathways. As indicated earlier, our segmentation algorithm has limitations when it comes to labelling segments with buildings especially when the buildings are close together or connected. Mislabelling may have contributed to part of the strong connection shown here. It is also speculated that these buildings have classrooms where students may spend many hours indoors taking classes without having to go outside of a building. These buildings are also relatively old constructions with aged ventilation systems that could increase risks of respiratory disease transmission. The CAS building that appears in the connection in Figure\n8 but not in Figure\n9, on the other hand, is a brand new building and stands by itself in a large open space. New ventilation and the fact that student activity has to often involve outdoor time periods whenever taking other classes out of the building both could lead to lower risks. These, are of course speculations but proves that such analysis, like other methods presented in this paper can be a useful exploratory analysis tool to reveal hidden patterns, given the availability of the detailed trajectory data.",

Technologies such as RFID are limited in application scope as the tracking system is self-contained and require meticulous setup in the targeted environment\n[79]. Wi-Fi-based positioning can be a promising technology to lead to highly detailed space-time behaviour data collection and studies with much improved indoor accuracies. However, such high accuracy leads to more serious privacy concerns that may be another barrier for their uses.",

This concern has been one of the limiting factors in efforts to model infectious disease transmission at the micro scale. As need for real-time surveillance and intervention at the micro scale becomes more obvious with increasing threats of pandemics in a globalized world, and as the potential for precise surveillance and intervention explodes with the fast advancement of technology, it is critical to confront the privacy issue involved in using such technology. It is the social responsibility of researchers to protect privacy when using data such as the tracking trajectories collected in this study. Legal regulations regarding the use of such technology and data are also expected to be put in place for both research and practice. Although our current legal framework has not yet adapted to the potential privacy abuses of tracking technology\n[55], initiatives such as the US. Federal Communications Commission\u2019s E-911 mandate has generated visions in the direction of progress in legal regulations regarding the use of such data and technology.",

With accurate indoor tracking technology, it is possible to set up real-time control and alert systems\n[79]. The idea is to monitor individual movements with portable devices during an outbreak. When someone is diagnosed as infected, his/her movements over the previous few days will be retrieved and others who have crossed paths with the infected will be given alerts to get checked. With more accurate indoor tracking, we are also able to obtain trajectory data in a single office or school building (such as the St. Francis school that marked one of the first outbreak of H1N1 flu infections in the US or a hospital ward that had many doctor infections in the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong) to reveal indoor transmission patterns and even identify building ventilation problems.",
