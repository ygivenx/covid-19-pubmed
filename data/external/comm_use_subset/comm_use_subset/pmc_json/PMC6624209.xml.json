Impediments to RSV vaccine discovery have been the need to immunize in the first weeks of life when infant immune responses are still sub-optimal and enhanced disease observed during a formalin inactivated vaccine trial in the late 1960s14. Live attenuated vaccines given intranasally, have proved difficult to sufficiently attenuate to limit upper airway congestion during vaccination, while still maintaining immunogenicity15,16. As a result, alternative approaches are being considered including boosting infant antibody levels through maternal sub-unit vaccine immunization, pre-season delivery of high titre extended half-life immunoglobulin, reducing virus circulation in the community by vaccination of older babies and children or by cocoon vaccination to interrupt chains of transmission leading to infant infection4,17,18. To advance the cocoon vaccination strategy, a better understanding of RSV transmission in household settings where most transmissions appear to occur is required18.",

However, our initial analysis of RSVA full genome sequences (~15,200 nt) showed significant promise in providing phylogenetic resolution of viruses circulating in different households10 and similar application of these methods have been shown for norovirus22, foot and mouth disease virus23, influenza A virus24, MERS-CoV25, and Ebola virus26,27.

Briefly, 47 households scattered across an area of approximately 21 km2 were followed up over a 6-month period beginning December 2009 and ending June 2010 coinciding with the RSV peak activity months in the area29. Households were defined as a group of people sharing a compound and eating from the same kitchen20. The selected households (abbreviated HHs) were given designated identifiers from 1 to 57 (HH01 to HH57). Twice weekly throughout the study period, a nasopharyngeal-flocked swab (NPS) was obtained from each member regardless of symptom status. The NPS samples were screened for RSV using a multiplex real-time RT-PCR method which subtyped RSV positives into RSVA and RSVB30. For whole genome sequencing (WGS), we targeted 20 select households that documented RSV infection of \u22652 members.

Similar to the ML phylogenies, the majority of the viruses clustered by household with the major clusters corresponding to the clades and sub-clades observed in the ML trees. Notably clades/sub-clades RSVA/Ia, RSVA/Ie, RSVB/Ia, RSVB/Ib, RSVB/IIa, RSVB/IIb, and RSVB/IV were observed in multiple HHs indicating potential transmission linkage of the involved HHs during the epidemic. In the timeline of viruses identified (Fig. 4, panel b), all except five households (HH06, HH26, HH38, HH41 and HH42) had a single RSV clade sequenced. The exceptional households had two virus clades infecting members but mostly one of the two clades predominated e.g. in HH06, HH41 and HH42. On the other hand, in the remaining two households distinct RSVA and RSVB outbreaks occurred: HH38 in which the first outbreak was RSVB/I and at a later date a second outbreak of RSVA/I, and HH26 with concurrent RSVA/I and RSVB/IV.",

This was motivated by unsuccessful vaccines for early infants and that evaluation of other options (family cocooning, school age vaccination20,42) requires an improved understanding of WAIFW. Our earlier work, based on temporal case observations, clearly suggested that the older children (siblings or cousins aged <15 years), particularly those attending school, played an important role in introducing the virus into the household leading to infant infection, but was not able to resolve within household transmission chains20. We have subsequently formalised the epidemiological analysis of RSV transmission in the household using an individual-based statistical approach to quantify the risk of infection from a range of host, pathogen and environmental factors7. The present study takes an alternative perspective of the problem, by focusing on the temporal patterns of genomic sequence variation to elucidate who infects whom in the household. This work extends a smaller study based on genomes of RSVA from 9 households10, to the current study of genomes of RSVA and RSVB in 20 households.",

For six households (32%) where the infant was infected (n = 8), we could identify the 1\u20132 most likely individuals who infected them. The infant suspected infectors were mostly household co-occupants <12 year of age (7/8, specifically toddlers (43%) and school-aged (50%) age-groups). Only in a single instance was an adult co-occupant (mother) suspected to be the infant infector.

Overall, the sequenced RSVB viruses showed ~7 times greater genomic diversity compared to RSVA. It is likely that the observed difference reflects annual stochasticity in the number of introduced strains rather than an inherent biological difference although a few previous reports indicated existence of subtle differences between the two groups in transmissibility and local persistence21,45. Despite the close genetic relatedness of RSVA viruses detected in the study, our analysis showed that the 9 infected households were invaded by up to 5 distinct RSVA \u201cepidemiological strains\u201d that diverged at least 6 months before their collection date. For RSVB we determined that the 14 infected households were invaded by up to 7 distinct RSVB epidemiological strains. Highly similar intra-household and intra-host genomic variation patterns were observed between the two groups.",

The genome sequencing work targeted 20 households where \u22652 members were found to be RSV infected. Despite these households occurring in a small geographical area (~20 km2) it was surprising to see up to 12 epidemiological strains in circulation. Most of the sampled viruses clustered by household. Some households shared the infecting strain with other households, suggesting a shared infection source although direct transmission between these households was unlikely given the large fraction of non-sampled households. Four out of the 12 identified epidemiological strains occurred only in one household each. Notably, households in close physical proximity did not necessarily end up being infected with similar virus clades or subclades implying other unobserved epidemiological factors rather than physical proximity may be more important in determining WAIFW in this community46.",

It is possible that some of the infant co-index cases were the infectors of infants in the household, but our diagnostic method (nasopharyngeal swab combined with RT-PCR) failed to detect the virus in the preceding samples. This may occur perhaps due to limited virus replication in older individuals or our 3\u20134 days sampling interval may have been too wide to capture index cases before onward transmission.

If prolonged shedders, then it is perplexing that in some individuals, there was one or more negative sample(s) separating the positive samples. Alternately, these could be false negative assay results which may have arisen due to the sensitivity of our sampling or diagnostic method or that the virus was temporarily absent from the upper respiratory tract airway but was still present elsewhere in the individual\u2019s respiratory tract. Prolonged shedding of RSV of up to 2 months has been previously reported especially in immune-compromised populations47,48.

The pace of RSV substitutions was demonstrated to be insufficiently fast to enable the full inference of within household RSV transmission trees. Additionally, we have previously shown that patterns of sharing of minor variants does not add insight beyond the consensus sequence approach43. Since in close to half of the study households the infant participant was the infection index or co-index case, for future studies we recommend sampling protocols that also consider, in addition to households, other potential RSV transmission settings in the community e.g. child-care centres, post-natal clinics, schools, school transportation, sporting events etc. Contact data should be collected to reinforce the viral sequence data and epidemiological data to support robust inferences of transmission pairs46. The protocols for genomic sequencing also need to be optimised to obtain virus sequences even from samples with diminishing virus titres. Given the imperfections of analyses of epidemiological data or genomic data in isolation, there is a clear need to undertake the joint analysis of both sources of information using a probabilistic framework7, that will allow inference of events not directly observable with inevitably imperfect data.",
