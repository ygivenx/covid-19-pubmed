Promising new generation flu vaccine platforms include use of highly conserved peptides in a vaccine formulation; because, recent developments in biotechnology tools have made the large scale production of antigenic peptides highly feasible at low cost. Attempts were made to develop IAV peptide vaccine by coexpressing conserved peptides of M protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) with Hepatitis B capsid protein [5], and also using cocktail of conserved T and B cells peptides [6]. But due to lack of identified effective vaccine delivery and potent adjuvant system, peptides based vaccine candidates have been unsuccessful to induce robust response in pigs. Moreover, in intramuscularly vaccinated animals mucosal immune system is weakly activated. Recently, chimeric construct that express M2e on the surface loop of norovirus P particle (M2e-PP) was shown to produce high levels of antibody response and protect mice from a lethal challenge [7]. In pigs, M2e-PP also induced specific immune response, but failed to provide protection from disease (unpublished data).",

            "text": "Potent vaccine delivery and adjuvant systems are essential to enhance immunogenicity of peptides vaccine [8]. One of the endeavors of 21st century is delivery of vaccines and drugs through biocompatible and biodegradable polymer based nano or microparticles. PLGA (poly lactic-co-glycolic acid) is a nontoxic, FDA and European Medicines Agency approved polymer, and widely used as a vehicle for drug and vaccine delivery [9,10]. The properties of PLGA made it ideal to entrap even soluble vaccine Ags in nanoparticles (NP) (200\u2013600 nm) to elicit strong immune response [11]. PLGA-NP entrapped peptide Ags are being protected from enzymatic or ionic degradation in vivo until they are uptaken by antigen presenting cells (APCs) [12]. Particulate antigens are readily taken up by mucosal M cells and APCs in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues in intranasally vaccinated animals [13], which enhances antigen specific IFN\u03b3 secreting T cell response and production of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies in pigs [14,15]. Benefits of PLGA based intranasal vaccine delivery system with the inactivated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in pigs and Hepatitis B Ags in rodents has been demonstrated [14\u201317].",

Briefly, lung mononuclear cells (LMNCs) of all the pigs at DPC 7 were isolated by enzymatic digestion of lung tissues as described previously [14]. Five million LMNCs were restimulated with individual peptides (M2e, A1, A2, A7 and A8) (2 \u03bcg/ml), SwIV (multiplicity of infection [MOI] 1) or Phytohaemagglutinin (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 72 hr at 37\u00b0C in enriched RPMI 1640 (E-RPMI) (10% FBS, gentamicin [100 \u03bcg/ml], ampicillin [20 \u03bcg/ml], 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 nM 2-ME) in Brefeldin A (B7651, SIGMA) were added during the last 6 hr of incubation of LMNCs treated with or without the indicated stimulants. The surface immunostained cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with the cell-permeabilization buffer (85.9% deionized water, 11% PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+, 3% formaldehyde solution and 0.1% saponin) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The cells were washed and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-pig IFN\u03b3 (clone P2G10) or its isotype control mAb (BD Biosciences) in 0.1% saponin containing fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) buffer. Immunostained cells were acquired using the FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA) software. All specific cell population frequencies were presented as the percent of total CD3+ lymphocytes.",

We entrapped M2e-PP and pooled four peptides separately in PLGA-NP using the similar procedure. In vitro characterization of both peptides and M2e-PP entrapped NPs showed comparable results and the data of M2e-PP is shown here. Entrapment efficiency of M2e-PP in NP was 50\u201354%. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging of NP revealed them as spherical particles (Fig 1A). Size distribution profile of the NP was determined by dynamic light scattering technique and it was 227\u2013316 nm with the majority of NPs around 260 nm (Fig 1B). Surface charge of the particles was -21.93\u00b12.93 mV (an average value of ten runs) as measured by zeta potential analysis. In vitro protein release profile of M2e-PP from NP-entrapped M2e-PP suspended in PBS overtime was quantified under physiological conditions. PLGA-NP containing the vaccine cargo carry a small quantity of surface anchored Ags and they rapidly release upon reconstitution in PBS (\u2264 10 min) called the burst release; while the entrapped Ags in NP release over a period of 4\u20136 weeks [15]. We observed a burst release of 14.3%, cumulative release of 25% (including the burse release) after 2 hr (day 0) and the total release of 64% over a period of 4 weeks (Fig 1C). Thus, our results indicated that PLGA-NP release entrapped M2e-PP gradually, supporting the principle of depot-effect provided by PLGA-NP under in vivo conditions.",

Therefore, enhancing influenza virus specific immune response to highly conserved antigenic epitopes is important to achieve increased breadth of protective immunity. Hence, to elicit strong specific response to influenza, we entrapped highly conserved H1N1 peptides in PLGA-NPs and inoculated intranasally in the form of mist to pigs to efficiently reach the mucosal inductive sites in the respiratory tract. Our results demonstrated a significantly reduced detectable infectious challenged virus in the airways of NPP and NPA vaccinated pigs, associated with augmented antigen-specific T cell response in the lung lymphocytes of NPP inoculated animals. Amounts of each of the four peptides entrapped in NP-Peptides vaccine is assumed to be the same, because in another independent study individual peptides entrapped in PLGA NPs had comparable levels of entrapment efficiency. In addition, results of ex vivo restimulation of LMNCs with all the four individual peptides elicited comparable peptide specific T cell response in NPP vaccinated pigs.",

Conserved A7 and A8 peptides elicit antibody response in pigs, but failed to reduce the flu symptoms [5,6]. Soluble antigens and peptides are poorly immunogenic, but when entrapped in NPs elicit strong immune response [38,39]. Pulmonary immune response varies with the vaccine particle size and surface charge, because particles of \u2264 500 nm are readily phagocytized by dendritic cells and M cells at mucosal sites [40,41]. Consistent with that the size of our candidate NP-Peptide vaccine was approximately 300 nm. PLGA-NP entrapped Ags are stable for 4\u20136 weeks and facilitate activation and maturation of APCs [40,42]. Mechanism of induction of increased breadth of protective response by NPs based vaccine delivery system is mediated through efficient internalization of particulate Ags, followed by processing and cross-presentation of entrapped Ags by dendritic cells and macrophages to na\u00efve CD8 T cells [43\u201345]. This has been shown specifically using PLGA NPs delivery system mediated by their ability to disrupt phagosomes and release of cargo into cytosol for MHC class I loading [44,45]. Based on our data with heightened peptide-specific CD4 CD8 double positive T cell response in LMNCs of NPP pig group, it is expected that both dendritic cells and macrophages in the lungs of pigs would have uptaken and efficiently cross-presented the PLGA-NP delivered peptide Ags to na\u00efve T cells. Pigs vaccinated with M2eHBc fusion proteins without NP delivery system has failed to protect animals from a challenge virus induced flu symptoms [5].",

Further, M. vaccae WCL was not entrapped in PLGA-NP, because greater adjuvant effects by soluble compared to NP entrapped M. tb WCL in intranasally vaccinated pigs was observed [14,15].
