            "text": "There are, however, several hurdles to introducing an early childhood influenza control program. First, there are limited vaccine options. IIV3s have moderate efficacy in young children (22), and do not induce persistent immune response. Inactivated influenza vaccines, quadrivalent (IIV4s) offer broader protection against the two B lineages, which usually co-circulate yet alternate in dominance (2). Although B viruses predominate in children, they are a significant cause of hospitalizations and deaths in all age groups. Use of IIV4 could reduce a mismatch between a vaccine and circulating B lineages, but the benefits would be modest (23). Adjuvanted IIV3s (aIIV3s) are more effective than non-adjuvanted vaccines. In a trial of MF59-adjuvanted IIV3 in 4 700 children 6\u201372 months old (24), efficacy was 85% (the highest ever reported in children 6\u201324 months old) and persisted after the second dose, and there were no safety issues. According to one study, the correlate of protection threshold is higher in children than in adults (25); for example, titers of 1:110 in children and 1:40 in adults were both associated with 50% clinical protection. In Canada, aIIV3 is licensed for use in infants and young children 6\u201324 months old due to its superior immunogenicity and acceptable safety profile (26). At the roundtable meeting, use of the live attenuated vaccine was also discussed, but as this vaccine is not available in Argentina or Brazil, the information was not included in this report.",

Proposed education actions included: 1) enhancing education of health professionals; 2) reinforcing the nurse\u2019s role in promoting immunization and delivering vaccines; 3) raising awareness of the risk of influenza in the population; 4) targeting high-risk groups, working with scientific societies and specialists; and 5) strengthening the physician\u2013parent relationship and helping parents understand the risk/benefits of vaccines.
