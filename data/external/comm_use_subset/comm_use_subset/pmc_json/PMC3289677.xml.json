Human NoVs have a worldwide distribution and represent the major cause of non bacterial gastroenteritis. The genome of NoV possesses three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding for a large non-structural polyprotein, a major capsid protein (VP1) and a small basic structural protein (VP2). Based on the full-length VP1, NoVs have been classified into five distinct genogroups (GI to V) [2]. GI, GII and GIV NoVs infect humans, with GII NoVs accounting for the majority of human infections [3]. NoVs have also been detected in animals and classified as GII (swine), GIII (ruminants), GIV (lions and dogs) and GV (mice) [1], [4].",

Subsequently NoVs genetically related to the lion NoV were identified in the fecal samples of dogs with diarrhea in Italy and Greece [4], [6]. Based on the full-length VP1, the lion and dog NoVs were classified as a distinct genotype (GIV.2) within GIV, along with human Alphatron-like NoVs (GIV.1) [2]. Some canine NoVs are not classifiable within any established genogroups (GI-V), as they are distantly related to all other human and animal NoVs in the VP1 region [7]\u2013[9].",

Small round structured viruses (SRSVs) have been detected occasionally in the feces of cats by using electron microscopy (EM) and have been mostly characterized as FCV [12], [14]. Interestingly, Norwalk-like 27-nm virus particles, clearly distinguishable from FCVs, were detected from an outbreak of vomiting and diarrhea in adult cats in Germany in 1987, although the viruses were neither adapted to cultivation in vitro nor characterized further [15]. More recently, antibodies specific for the baculovirus-expressed VP1 of Lion/NoV/Pistoia-387/06/IT were detected in the sera of cats by ELISA. These previous findings suggest that NoVs infect cats [16].",

Although it is not clear whether FCV also plays a role as an enteric pathogen or if it is shed in the feces after primary localization in other regions, it has been occasionally identified in the feces of cats and associated with enteric disease [28]\u2013[31]. Also, differences in resistance to bile acids have been found between FCV strains of enteric and respiratory origin, thus suggesting that enteric FCVs have the ability to replicate actively in the enteric tract while respiratory FCVs do not [14]. By EM observation, SRSVs have been detected in 6% of the stools of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cats [12].

This novel feline calicivirus was detected in 6/14 samples collected from cats housed in a shelter in New York State (collection B) (Table 1). These findings are in agreement with previous evidence that cats can be infected with NoVs [15], [16]. It is of relevance that animals from group B showed enteric symptoms and were young kittens almost of the same age (8 to 12 weeks old). This age period is critical for kittens, since maternally derived antibodies tend to wane and the animals become fully susceptible to various pathogens [32]. On the other hand, NoVs were not detected in animals from group A. This might reflect either geographic or temporal variations, age-related patterns of susceptibility or merely the relatively small number of samples included in the analysis.",

Therefore, sequence data spanning this region is available for most NoV strains.

In this study the complete genome sequence of a GIV NoV was determined and compared with full-length genomic sequences of NoV strains available in the databases, revealing the highest nt identity to GII NoVs (56.4\u201357.6% nt), whilst nt identity to GI, GIII and GV NoV was \u226447.1% (Table 3, Figure 1). This confirms that NoV genogroups GII and GIV are genetically much more related to each other than to other NoV genogroups. The GIV includes both animal (carnivores) GIV.2 and human GIV.1 viruses [6], [7]. Human GIV.1 NoVs are identified only sporadically although sewage-based surveillance studies conducted in some countries suggest that these NoVs are rather common [37]. Human GIV.1 NoVs are more related to carnivore GIV.2 NoVs than to other humans NoV genogroups (GI and GII), thus suggesting an intersection during the evolution of GIV NoVs, likely due to the social interactions of humans with carnivores during the process of domestication and to the possibility of heterologous infections, as demonstrated under experimental conditions [38], [39].",
