            "text": "Bats are present throughout most of the world and account for more than a fifth of mammalian species. They are natural reservoirs of some of the most deadly zoonotic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Henipaviruses, and SARS coronavirus [1], [2]. Recently, nucleic acids obtained from bat samples indicated bats may be a reservoir of a new group of influenza viruses (bat-influenza) that are phylogenetically very distantly related to other influenza viruses [3], [4]. Type A, B, and C influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and their genomes are composed of 7\u20138 negative sense RNA segments (vRNAs). While influenza B (IBV) and C viruses mainly infect human hosts, influenza A virus (IAV) has a broad host range; including humans, marine mammals, horses, pigs, waterfowl, and poultry. New subtypes of IAV, which have novel hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins, are introduced into the human population by zoonosis and this periodically leads to devastating pandemics. Past pandemics include the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d (H1N1) in 1918, \u201cAsian flu\u201d (H2N2) in 1957, \u201cHong Kong flu\u201d (H3N2) in 1968, \u201cRussian flu\u201d (H1N1) in 1977, and the recent \u201cswine origin\u201d flu (pH1N1) in 2009. Pandemic viruses are often reassortant viruses composed of vRNAs that are derived from multiple IAV lineages that previously circulated in swine and/or avian reservoirs (e.g., 1957 avian-human reassortant, 1968 avian-human reassortant, and 2009 avian-swine-human reassortant). The discovery of putative bat-influenza viruses expands the known host species reservoirs that may serve as a source of novel viruses, which is a major concern for public and animal health [4], [5].",

This has led to questions such as: (1) are the putative bat-influenza vRNA sequences identified derived from infectious viruses or are they merely nucleic acid relics harbored in bats [5], (2) are the vRNA segments sequenced from a single bat-influenza virus or are they from multiple potentially incompatible viruses, and (3) were the sequences of the complete gene segments, which is a significant technical challenge, determined accurately. The inability to culture infectious viruses is the major hurdle to confirm the existence of these novel influenza viruses, and to answer important questions, such as pathogenicity in animal models, ability to reassort with other influenza viruses, and their potential risk to public health [5], [11]. The goals of this study were to synthesize the complete viral genome, characterize the bat-influenza virus using non-infectious approaches, then generate a replicative virus, and use it as a model to better understand bat-influenza viruses.",

Thousands of spherical influenza-like particles budded into the supernatants of human cells (293T) transfected with the Bat09 reverse genetics plasmids (\nFig. 1A\n).

To further examine if the HA and NA proteins are the major blocks to the propagation of the Bat09 virus, we attempted to rescue reassortant viruses that contained the 6 internal protein coding vRNAs (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from Bat09 and the surface glycoprotein vRNAs (HA and/or NA) from a recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8). PR8 is a lab adapted H1N1 virus that has been used for many years in research and vaccine settings because it replicates efficiently in embryonated chicken eggs, cell lines (e.g., MDCK) and in the mice, but has low risk to humans. However, the three PR8-HA/NA reassortant genotypes containing the Bat09 internal protein vRNAs couldn't be rescued following transfection (\nFig. 1B\n). While the Bat09 internal protein/vRNAs are capable of generating proteins and producing influenza-like particles, they may have critical mutations that were inhibiting infectivity, or they can't cooperate efficiently with the PR8-HA/NA proteins/vRNAs.",

The Bat09 NA gene segment was modified using a similar strategy to replace the NA coding region with PR8-N1, while the putative bat NA packaging signals were retained (mN1) (\nFig. 1C\n\n and Fig. S2). Co-expression of the mH1 and mN1 vRNAs with the six Bat09 internal protein vRNAs efficiently rescued a reassortant Bat09:mH1mN1 virus (\nFig. 1B\n). The reassortant Bat09:mH1mN1 formed particles similar to that of Bat09 (\nFig. 1A\n) and replicated robustly in vitro and in ovo (\nFig. 1D, 1E\n). Next generation sequencing demonstrated that the consensus sequence of the virus stocks from 1 passage in MDCK cells or embryonated chicken eggs was identical to that of the reverse genetics plasmids. Furthermore, even after 3 passages in MDCK cells, we still didn't identify any nucleotide polymorphisms accounting for >10% of the genomic population that would suggest strong selective pressure on Bat09 genes or the modified HA/NA genes of PR8.",

To further investigate pathogenicity of Bat09-like viruses we rescued another modified Bat09 virus that expresses H3N2 surface glycoproteins from A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) (TX98), which we have used in pigs previously [14]. The HA/NA vRNAs of Bat09:mH3mN2 were modified using a similar strategy used to generate the mH1/mN1, whereby the coding regions of Bat09 glycoproteins were replaced with TX98 H3N2, while the putative Bat09 packaging signals were retained (mH3/mN2) (\nFig. 3A\n). The rescued Bat09:mH3mN2 virus replicated to peak titers close to that of TX98 (\nFig. 3B\n) and both viruses were inoculated into mice to compare the morbidity (weight loss), mortality and virus replication at various times post inoculation. All mice survived infection and both viruses (Bat09:mH3mN2 and TX98) caused little effect on weight gain as compared to the mock inoculated animals (\nFig. 3C\n), indicating little overall disease. Titration of virus in the lung tissues showed that the Bat09:mH3mN2 virus replicated as efficiently as the TX98 control in the mice at early time points, yet it appeared to be cleared more rapidly (\nFig. 3D\n). This data suggests that some of the pathogenicity observed in the Bat09:mH1mN1 infected mice likely results from the mouse adapted HA/NA of PR8. However, it is clear that the bat influenza internal protein vRNAs do support replication of the modified viruses (Bat09:mH1mN1 and Bat09:mH3mN2) in vitro, in ovo, and in the mouse lungs. The slightly lower replication efficiency and pathogenicity of those two viruses compared to the corresponding PR8 and TX98 viruses could be ascribable to either the nature of the Bat09 internal protein vRNAs or the engineering of the modified HAs and NAs.",

Therefore, the biological roles of the various vRNA segments and their protein products are likely to have both similarities and intriguing differences. Many deadly bat viruses (e.g., filoviruses) have evolved powerful molecular mechanisms that inhibit host (e.g., human) immune responses [15]\u2013[18]. Therefore, to gain an understanding of how bat-influenza viruses may evade the host innate immune response we analyzed the Bat09 NS1 protein using interferon induction experiments and carboxy-terminal truncation mutations known to attenuate IAVs. The NS1 protein of IAVs is critical for pathogenicity of many strains because of its ability to antagonize the host interferon response [19]. To compare the direct effect of Bat09-NS1 and PR8-NS1 on interferon-\u03b2 production, we expressed the proteins ectopically in human HEK-293T and then infected them with Sendai virus to stimulate the innate immune response. Activation of interferon-\u03b2 promoter was determined by a luciferase mediated reporter assay [16]. Bat09-NS1 inhibited host interferon-\u03b2 induction comparable to that of the PR8-NS1, and carboxy-terminal truncation of Bat-NS1 protein (NS1-128 and NS1-73, see Fig. S2C for diagram) decreased its ability to inhibit interferon-\u03b2 production (\nFig. 4A\n). These results are consistent with the attenuating effect that these NS1 truncations have on PR8 (\nFig. 4A\n) and other IAV NS1 proteins; thereby, providing a strategy to generate live attenuated influenza vaccines [14], [20]\u2013[22].",

Altogether the NS1 studies show that the Bat09 NS1 protein inhibits host interferon-\u03b2 production and carboxy-terminal truncation mutations reduce its ability to antagonize this response, likely through mechanisms similar to IAV (\nFig. 4A\n). However, in contrast to IAV, truncation (NS1-128, NS1-73) of the Bat09 NS1 didn't dramatically impact the viruses' ability to antagonize the host innate response, or replicate and cause disease in mice (\nFig. 4B, C\n\n and \n\nFig. 5\n).",

Asparagine (N) 701 in the PB2 protein is a mammalian-signature in IAVs and when this residue was mutated to aspartic acid (D, an avian-signature) in the modified Bat09 (Bat-701D), it decreased virus titers in lungs, morbidity (minor weight loss), and resulted in 100% survival (\nFig. 6\n). The bat-influenza PB2 also has a serine (S) residue at position 627, which is unlike either mammalian or avian IAVs. Replacing the serine 627 with the mammalian-signature residue lysine (K) [24], [27] in the context of 701D (Bat-627K/701D) increased virus replication in the lungs but only caused slightly more weight loss (compared to the Bat-701D virus) and it remained attenuated in mice (\nFig. 6\n). In contrast, introducing another virulence marker PB2-E158G [23] into the PB2-N701D virus (Bat-158G/701D) dramatically increased the pathogenicity of the Bat09 virus (100% mortality), which was higher than the Bat09 virus with wild type PB2 (Bat09:mH1mN1, \nFig. 6\n). In addition, introducing the PB2-E158G (Bat-158G) into the wild type PB2 resulted the most significant increase of virus replication, morbidity, and mortality (\nFig. 6\n), indicating there is an additive effect between the two virulence determinants (PB2-158G and PB2-701N) in the Bat09 PB2. All viruses collected from mouse lungs were deep sequenced to confirm the stability of the engineered mutations and although sporadic nucleotide polymorphisms (10% - 44%) were detected in the viral genomes (1 to 2 such polymorphisms per mouse sample on average), none of them occurred at the engineered loci. The high genetic stability of the modified Bat09 viruses in mice is consistent with the notion that the bat influenza viruses are mammalian viruses that have been evolving and adapting in the bats for a long period of time.",

Interestingly, the PB2-627S showed intermediate polymerase activity compared to the PB2-627K and PB2-627E (\nFig. 7\n). In addition, the polymerase activity of the PB2-158G and PB2-627E/K mutants decreased proportionally when they were combined with the PB2-701D mutation (\nFig. 7\n).

Furthermore, efficient replication of bat-influenza internal protein vRNAs in human cells and mice, as well as their pathogenicity, necessitated an assessment of reassortment potential between Bat09 and other influenza viruses. Replication of vRNAs from different parental viruses is a factor critical in the generation of reassortant progeny. Transcription/replication of mini-genome reporter constructs showed that the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is a heterotrimer of PB1, PB2, and PA, from bat-influenza, IAVs, and IBVs generally recognize and transcribe their cognate vRNAs more efficiently than non-cognate vRNAs (Fig. S3). Intriguingly, the Bat09 polymerase replicated the IBV reporter very efficiently (Fig. S3). Additionally, most RdRp combinations (PB2, PB1, PA) between bat-influenza and IAVs nearly abolished the polymerase activity in this very sensitive mini-genome reporter assay (\nFig. 8A\u2013I\n). Interestingly, the NP protein, which is a single-strand RNA-binding nucleoprotein, is completely compatible between Bat09 and IAVs (\nFig. 8A\u2013I\n), but it is incompatible between the bat-influenza and IBV (\nFig. 8J\n).",

However, when MDCK cells were inoculated at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) with both PR8 and Bat09:mH1mN1 viruses, reassortment between the two parental viruses was not detected. We plaque purified 118 progeny viruses from the co-infection and 53 of them were the parental PR8 virus and 65 of them were the parental Bat09:mH1mN1 virus. Although more exhaustive classical reassortant studies are needed to completely evaluate the generation of natural reassortants between these viruses, the data indicate that PR8 and Bat09:mH1mN1 don't efficiently reassort.",

Reassortment of the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP segments in mini-genome polymerase activity assay demonstrated that the Bat09 and Bat10 viruses were fully compatible (\nFig. 8K\n). Most importantly, successful reassortment between the two modified bat viruses (Bat09:mH1mN1ss and Bat10:mH1mN1ss) (\nTable 5\n\n and Fig. S2 for diagrams of constructs) proved that these genetically divergent bat-influenza virus vRNAs were highly interchangeable, in contrast to their very low compatibility with IAV and IBV. Interestingly, classical co-infection of the Bat09:mH1mN1 and Bat10:mH1mN1 viruses in MDCK cells readily generated reassortant progeny viruses with various genotypes, and some were apparently preferentially selected (e.g., Bat10:Bat09-NS reassortant, Table S2), demonstrating the merit of classic co-infection strategy in identification of gene constellations that may have certain advantages. Collectively the mini-genome replication, reverse genetics reassortment, and co-infection reassortment experiments strongly suggest that two divergent bat-influenza viruses readily reassort with each other, whereas they won't reassort with canonical IAVs in the natural setting.",

Viruses within a Genus readily reassort upon co-infection of a single host cell (e.g., avian and swine IAV); whereas, viruses from a different Genus (e.g., IAV and IBV) don't reassort. The factors important for generation of reassortant progeny from two parental influenza viruses include: recognition and replication of vRNAs by parental virus RdRp, protein-protein interaction/compatibility (e.g, heterotrimeric RdRp), and vRNA-protein interactions needed for virion morphogenesis. The RNA transcription/replication promoter of each influenza vRNA segment is formed by base pairing of highly conserved nucleotides at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini, which form a partially double-stranded structure. The IAV Genus has specific nucleotide variations within the termini that distinguish it from IBV. The termini of bat-influenza vRNAs also show conserved 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 complementarity; however, they also have distinct nucleotide variation. Therefore, we used mini-genome replication studies to analyze promoter recognition and RdRp activity of various combinations of the PB1, PB2, PA subunits in combination with various NPs from IAV, IBV, or bat-influenza. The data show that the wild type RdRp most efficiently replicate their cognate vRNAs, and that both IAV and IBV RdRp have 50\u201360% reduction in activity with the bat-influenza mini-genome. Many PB1, PB2, PA combinations between bat-influenza and IAV/IBV dramatically reduce activity, which demonstrates protein-protein incompatibility between the RdRp subunits. Interestingly, the bat-influenza NP and IAV NP were completely compatible in the mini-genome assay, however NP reassortant viruses could not be generated (\nTable 2\n and \nTable 3\n) suggesting that the incompatibility of NPs may also involve complicated protein-vRNA interactions.",

However, our reassortant analysis indicates that while two divergent bat-influenzas readily reassort, bat-influenza and IAVs don't easily reassort in co-infection experiments. Reverse genetics reassortment studies showed the PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and NS vRNAs of bat-influenza don't efficiently reassort with the IAV or IBV, and provide many additional tantalizing results. For example, reassortants were not rescued from relatively compatible RdRp combinations in the mini-genome assay (e.g. Bat-PB2/PR8-PB1/PR8-PA, \nFig. 8A\n) and demonstrate that divergent Bat09 and Bat10 can efficiently reassort with each other (\nTable 5\n). The M segment is the most highly conserved gene among influenza A and B viruses. We found that the PR8-M segment could substitute for the Bat09-M segment (\nTable 2\n), indicating that the M vRNAs/protein(s) of PR8 and Bat09 have enough conservation in both cis-acting packaging signals and functional domains of the proteins (M1/M2) to enable the replication of the modified Bat09 virus. In contrast, putative packaging signal swapping of the NP and NS segments didn't overcome reassortment defects suggesting that incompatibility at the protein-protein or protein-vRNA level is likely to be a critical factor inhibiting reassortment between the bat-influenza and other influenza viruses. Alternatively, one could argue that that since the vRNA packaging signals of bat-influenza NP and NS segments have not been delineated, the putative packaging regions incorporated in the Batps-PR8 constructs may not be sufficient for packaging the modified vRNAs. However, the well-defined PR8 packaging signals incorporated in our modified gene segments should be sufficient to package the corresponding bat-influenza NP and NS vRNAs (PR8ps-Bat-NP and PR8ps-Bat-NS, Fig. S2D) in the PR8 backbone. The failure to rescue the PR8ps-Bat NP or NS viruses, as well as the PR8:Bat09-M reassortant virus, strongly suggests protein-protein or protein-vRNA level incompatibility and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the functional domains of these proteins through characterizing chimeric/mosaic proteins containing motifs/domains from both viruses.",

            "text": "Nucleotide sequences of the eight gene segments of A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/164/2009 (H10N17) (Bat09) were retrieved from the GenBank database. A total of 472 oligonucleotides of 56\u201360 bases in length were designed for enzymatic assembly of the eight segments. The assembly and error correction processes were performed as recently described [32], [33], modified with increased time at all extension steps (from 72\u00b0C for 1 min to 72\u00b0C for 2 min) for efficient assembly of the polymerase segments. The synthesized segments (Fig. S1) were cloned into the modified bidirectional influenza reverse genetics vectors pBZ66A12 [34] using the recombination-based method [35] and transformed into Stella competent E. coli cells (Clontech). Colonies were selected and sequenced. The appropriate clones for each segment were propagated for plasmid preparation and verified by sequencing. The resulting plasmids are pBZ146A1 (PB2), pBZ147A11 (PB1), pBZ148A20 (PA), pBZ149A30 (HA), pBZ150A31 (NP), pBZ151A36 (NA), pBZ152A42 (M) and pBZ153A45 (NS). The whole process only took seven days to complete. The plasmids containing Bat09 PB2 mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the pBZ146A1 as template. The NS1 truncation constructs were generated by Gibson assembly and details of the truncations are diagramed in Fig. S2C. The modified (m) Bat09 HA and NA (mH1, mN1, mH1ss, and mN1ss, see Fig. S2A, S2B for diagrams, and Fig. S4 for sequence alignment) were synthetized by Gibson assembly from oligonucleotides. Silent substitutions (ss) were introduced to disrupt the putative packaging signals in the PR8 HA and NA terminal coding regions. The mH1ss and mN1ss are thus more appropriate than the mH1 and mN1 to assess the HA and NA packaging signal compatibility between Bat09 and PR8. The Batps-PR8-NP, PR8ps-Bat-NP, Batps-PR8-NS, and PR8ps-Bat-NP constructs were constructed similarly and diagramed in Fig. S2D. As a comparison of the speed of different synthesis strategies, the eight gene segments of A/flat-faced bat/Peru/033/2010 (H18N11) (Bat10) were synthesized by Genewiz (NJ, USA) in the vector plasmid of pUC57 based on the GenBank database and subcloned into pHW2000 vector. The resulting plasmids (pHW-H18-PB2, pHW-H18-PB1, pHW-H18-PA, pHW-H18-HA, pHW-H18-NP, pHW-H18-NA, pHW-H18-M and pHW-H18-NS) were confirmed by sequencing. The whole process took more than one month. The PB2, PB1, PA and NP genes were also subcloned into the pDZ vector for use in the mini-genome assay. Diagrams of the mutant or modified genes of Bat09 and Bat10 are described in Fig. S2. The pPol1-NS-Luc reporters used in the mini-genome polymerase activity assay were described in Fig. S2E. Sequences of all constructs used in this study were confirmed to ensure absence of unwanted mutations and the GenBank accession numbers are KM203345-KM203356.",

The only modification to the procedure was the primers used for amplification were changed to match bat influenza termini. The oligonucleotide primers used were Uni12/Inf-5G (5\u2032-GGGGGGAGCAGAAGCAGG-3\u2032) and Uni13/Inf-1 (5\u2032-CGGGTTATTAGTAGAAACAAGG-3\u2032). The M-RTPCR amplicons were used for Illumina Miseq library construction via Nextera DNA sample prep kit (Illumina, Inc.) and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. SNP variations were identified using custom software that applies statistical tests to minimize false positive SNP calls that could be caused by the types of sequence-specific errors that may occur in Illumina reads identified and described in Nakamura, et al. [37]. To overcome this problem, the protocol requires observing the same SNP, at a statistically significant level, in both sequencing directions. Once a minimum minor allele frequency threshold and significance level are established by the user, the number of minor allele observations and major allele observations in each direction and the minimum minor allele frequency threshold are used to calculate a p-value based on the binomial distribution cumulative probability, and if the p-values calculated in each of the two sequencing directions are both less than the Bonferroni-corrected significance level, then the SNP call is accepted. For our analyses, we used a significance level of 0.05 (Bonferroni-corrected for tests in each direction to 0.025), and a minimum minor allele frequency threshold of 10% of the read population.",

Both modified Bat09:mH1mN1 and Bat10:mH1mN1 viruses showed similar replication kinetics in MDCK cells, whereas the PR8 replicated more efficiently than both modified viruses in MDCK cells. Therefore, for the co-infection study with PR8 and Bat09:mH1mN1 viruses, the cells were infected with the PR8 at MOI of 1 and with the Bat09:mH1mN1 at MOI of 4 (a ratio of both viruses is 1\u22364). For the co-infection study with Bat09:mH1mN1 and Bat10:mH1mN1 viruses, the cells were infected with each virus at MOI of 1 (a ratio of both viruses is 1\u22361). The co-infected MDCK cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 1 hour. After 1 hour of incubation, the supernatant was removed and the infected cells were washed with fresh MEM for 10 times. One mL of infection medium supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) was added on cells. The supernatant containing progeny viruses was collected at 24 hours after inoculation. Plaque assays were performed in MDCK cells to select single virus from co-infected supernatants. The purified single virus (plaque) was amplified for further analysis. To identify the origin of each gene of the purified single virus, specific RT-PCR was used to differentiate internal genes from Bat09:mH1mN1, Bat10:mH1mN1 and PR8 viruses (primers for specific RT-PCR are available upon request). The surface HA and NA genes were differentiated by sequencing HA and NA non-coding regions (packaging signals) since three parental viruses contain identical HA and NA ORF sequences and different sequences in non-coding region (it is difficult to differentiate them by RT-PCR). For the RT-PCR, RNAs were extracted from each amplified single virus using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized by using the bat universal 12 primer (5\u2032-AGCAGAAGCAGG-3\u2032) for the samples from the co-infection study with Bat09:mH1mN1 and Bat10:mH1mN1 viruses, and by using a mixture of an IAV universal 12 primer (5\u2032-AGCRAAAGCAGG-3\u2032) and the bat universal 12 primer (5\u2032-AGCAGAAGCAGG-3\u2032) for the samples from the co-infection study with Bat09:mH1mN1 and PR8 viruses. If the origin of internal genes determined by the specific RT-PCR was inconclusive, sequencing was performed to confirm the results from specific RT-PCR (All sequence primers are available upon request).",
