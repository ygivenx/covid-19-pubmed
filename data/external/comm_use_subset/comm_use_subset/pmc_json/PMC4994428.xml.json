Rhinovirus was detected in around half of the virus-positive ILI episodes, and was the most common virus, followed by Influenza virus or Coronavirus, RSV, MPV and PIV3, as in the recent Michigan household study [4]. Similarly, half of the virus-positive ILI cases detected amongst adults in the community in Australia were Rhinoviruses, with Influenza and Coronaviruses the next most common [3]. Interestingly, Rhinoviruses also predominated in ILI patients of all ages admitted to hospitals in Vietnam between July 2008 and June 2009 [20]. We did not have sufficient numbers to reliably describe the etiology of ILI in young children, other than to conclude that Rhinoviruses predominated, consistent with studies elsewhere [2]. Influenza virus accounted for a higher proportion of ILI amongst participants of the current study (17%), who have never received influenza vaccine, compared to studies in which more that half of the participants have been vaccinated (\u223c11%) [3], [4]. Furthermore, in the study of Howard et al., individual with influenza were less likely to have been vaccinated compared to the influenza virus negative group [3]. MPV was less common than in the Michigan study [4], and in community studies involving children [2] but not adults [3], and we and others found that MPV was more common in children aged 6\u201312 years [21], suggesting an effect of the type of household included and their age structures. Similarly, RSV detection was low in the current study compared to studies with higher proportions of young children [2], [4]. The detection of influenza virus in only 17% of ILI episodes, and the absence of seasonal trends for influenza, indicate that ILI surveillance may be of limited value for understanding influenza epidemiology if not combined with laboratory confirmation, in agreement with other studies [6], [7], [19].",

            "text": "Children did not contribute substantially to ILI burden or transmission in this study. In contrast, young children experienced significantly more ARI episodes than older age groups, and people from households with young children also experienced significantly more ARI episodes in the recent Michigan study [4]. Similarly, a study of adult index case households in Australia found significantly more ILI transmission if a child was present [22], and children were considered to be the main driving force for ARI transmission in the 1960/70s Tecumseh study [23]. It follows that if ILI predominates in children, they will frequently be involved in household transmission, either as index or contact cases. Differences in observations for children could reflect study design: the Michigan study only recruited households with at least four participants, and at least two children, and the case definition included milder illness. However, effects were maintained when analysis was restricted to households with at least four participants. In our previous analysis we found that influenza infection was not associated with the presence of children in the household or with caring for children if an adult [13]. Therefore differences in the role of children in household ILI may reflect differences in factors affecting transmission such as seasonality, contact patterns [24] and childcare practices. Childcare centre attendance significantly increased the rate of ILI, by 40%, amongst children in Australian communities [2]. School-based transmission may also be less intense in (sub)tropical settings because virus circulation is more constant, rather than seasonal, potentially reducing the pool of susceptible children [13]. A study of age-specific seasonality for Influenza and RSV in Hong Kong similarly concluded that none of the age groups consistently appear as the driving force for seasonal epidemics [25]. School closure has been adopted as an ILI control strategy based on studies that indicate that children are a major driving force for ILI transmission [26]. A statistical model using sentinel surveillance data from France also indicates that in this setting, where ILI predominates in children, 16\u201317% of cases may be prevented by school closure. The data presented in the current study indicate that school closure may have limited effect in this setting.",

Rhinovirus characteristics, including high case numbers, broad age range and distribution of family members who were index cases, propensity to transmit within households, and year-round detection, correspond with high infectiousness and extensive genetic diversity [27]. Influenza viruses have less extensive genetic diversity, but age-associations were consistent with greater antigenic drift for A/H3N2 compared to A/H1N1 and B [11], [13], [28], [29]. RSV exhibited high household transmission, but overall detection was low, consistent with reports that virtually all exposed, non-immunes will become infected, and with the small size of the most susceptible, early childhood age group [30]. Some households appeared to be particularly susceptible to Rhinovirus, Influenza virus or MPV because multiple members were affected, but episodes were not temporally related. Similarly, some individuals experienced repeated ILI and virus-positive ILI, suggestive of inherent susceptibility.",
