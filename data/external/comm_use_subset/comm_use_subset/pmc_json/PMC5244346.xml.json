Viruses within the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus in the family Caliciviridae are significant causes of gastroenteritis in humans and animals, with noroviruses alone causing \u223c200,000 deaths per annum in children <5 years of age (2, 3). Despite their socioeconomic impact, the fastidious nature of viruses within these genera has significantly hindered our understanding of their life cycles and the development of vaccines and therapeutics (4, 5). Porcine sapovirus (PSaV) is the only cultivable member of the genus Sapovirus and replicates in the presence of porcine intestinal contents or bile acids (4, 5). Therefore, PSaV serves as a robust model for studies on the sapovirus life cycle and for the development of therapeutic interventions (6).",

            "text": "The coexistence of viruses and their hosts imposes evolutionary pressure on both the virus and the host immune system. Therefore, viruses have evolved diverse strategies to create a suitable environment conducive to their existence by either activating or suppressing cellular pathways to facilitate replication. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway is one of several host pathways that participate in the modulation of the host response to the infection and the replicative life cycle of viruses (7). For example, the activation of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway results in increased replication of cytomegalovirus (8, 9), but PGE2 inhibits the replication of parainfluenza 3 virus and adenovirus (10, 11). COXs convert arachidonic acid released by phospholipase A2- and C-mediated hydrolysis of plasma membrane phospholipids following exposure to diverse physiological and pathological stimuli into prostaglandins (PGs), prostacyclins, and thromboxanes (12, 13). Three forms of COX have been identified to date, with COX-1 and COX-2 the most widely studied. COX-1 is constitutively expressed and is known to synthesize various PGs, including PGE2, that participate in a diverse range of normal physiological processes, such as cytoprotection of the gastric mucosa, regulation of renal blood flow, bone metabolism, nerve growth and development, wound healing, and platelet aggregation (12, 13). In contrast, COX-2 is rapidly induced by various stimuli, including viral infection, and catalyzes the synthesis of various PGs, including PGE2, that have varied activities, including proangiogenic or antiapoptotic properties (12, 13). Some of the biological effects of PGE2 on immunity and inflammation are exerted through binding to G-protein-coupled receptors on the plasma membrane called E prostanoid receptors (14). PGE2 is recognized as the major prostanoid produced in immune and nonimmune cells and acts as a potent regulator of cell-cell interaction, antigen presentation, cytokine production, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, and cell migration (14).",

The nonselective COX-1/2 inhibitor indomethacin and the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 both inhibited PSaV-mediated PGE2 production in a dose-dependent manner when added either immediately after the removal of the virus inoculum (posttreatment) or during the entire course of the infection (pre/posttreatment) (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, due to the reversible nature of the inhibitors, the pretreatment of cells and subsequent removal of the inhibitor prior to the addition of PSaV had no effect on the levels of PGE2 production (Fig. 2A and B). Similar results were also obtained with a range of other COX inhibitors (Fig. 2C and D and data not shown).",

There was no significant effect of COX inhibitors on PSaV replication when cells were pretreated but the inhibitors were removed prior to infection (pretreatment) (Fig. 3A to H and 4A to D). However, the inclusion of COX inhibitors following the removal of the virus inoculum (posttreatment) or during the entire course of infection (pre/posttreatment) resulted in a significant reduction in PSaV replication (Fig. 3A to H and 4A to D).

However, recent studies have indicated that this initial conclusion was incorrect, as PSaV remains sensitive to the type I interferon (IFN) response in the presence of bile acids (6) and bile acids function to promote virus uncoating (16). To determine whether bile acids have an effect on the induction of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway during PSaV replication, the induction of COX-2 and PGE2 was examined in the presence or absence of GCDCA following the transfection of the in vitro-transcribed and capped PSaV genome (Fig. 6). Transfected RNA was used to bypass any role of GCDCA during viral entry and uncoating (16). We observed that COX-2 and PGE2 were induced in cells transfected with in vitro-transcribed and capped PSaV genomic RNA, irrespective of whether GCDCA was present or absent (Fig. 6A). As expected, the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 reduced expression of COX-2 and PGE2 and replication of PSaV (Fig. 6A to D). These data indicate that induction of COX-2 and PGE2 was a direct result of PSaV replication and was not due to any supplementary effect of GCDCA.",

NO is a key molecule involved in the host defense mechanism against various pathogens, including protozoans, parasites, fungi, bacteria, and viruses (19). NO also has a regulatory role at many stages of the development of inflammation (20). To determine if the PGE2 produced during PSaV replication impacted NO production, we first examined the level of NO produced during PSaV replication. PSaV-infected cells maintained low levels of NO prior to 36 hpi, when a significant increase in PGE2 production was observed (Fig. 8A). These data suggested that COX induction and the associated increase in PGE2 production may play important roles in the inhibition of NO production during PSaV replication.",

Inhibition of COX-2 activity was found to lead to a concomitant increase in NO production during PSaV replication, which could be reversed in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME (Fig. 8B). The reversal of the effect of COX-2 inhibition by L-NAME also resulted in the subsequent restoration of PSaV infectivity levels, as well as PSaV RNA and protein levels (Fig. 8C to E). Collectively, these data suggest that the proviral effects of PGE2 produced by both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes as a result of PSaV infection are mediated by the inhibition of the antiviral effect of NO.",

As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses must therefore subvert and/or avoid the host response to infection in order to complete their life cycle. As a result, pathogens, including viruses, have evolved a wide variety of mechanisms that enable the control of cellular pathways, evade the host immune response, and hijack signaling pathways to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the potential role of the COX/PGE2 pathway in the PSaV life cycle and the control of infection. We found that the COX/PGE2 pathway was activated during the PSaV life cycle and that this activation had proviral effects via the inhibition of NO production. Furthermore, we determined that expression of the VPg and ProPol proteins of PSaV was sufficient to induce COX expression and PGE2 production.",

NO production is known to restrict vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection (23), an effect that is thought to be offset by the induction of PGE2 production during VSV replication in vivo (18).

In contrast to rotavirus infection (28\u201330), little NO production was observed during PSaV replication in LLC-PK cells, possibly due to the synthesis of PGE2, suggesting that NO may not be involved in sapovirus-induced diarrhea.

Among the inhibitors tested, the COX-2-specific inhibitors NS-398 and celecoxib and the nonselective COX-1/2 inhibitor indomethacin exerted stronger anti-PSaV effects than other inhibitors, with \u223c1,000-fold decreases in virus yield and RNA synthesis. However, other COX-2-specific inhibitors had weaker inhibitory effects on PSaV replication, most likely due to their less potent activity and the fact that higher concentrations required for effective COX inhibition resulted in cell toxicity observed during their use. In addition, more robust inhibitory effects of the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398 and the COX-1/2 nonselective inhibitor indomethacin on PSaV replication was observed in posttreatment than in pre/posttreatment. The reason why posttreatment with these inhibitors has a stronger effect than pre/posttreatment remains unknown. One possibility is that it could be an off-target effect of using high doses of the inhibitors in LLC-PK cells, although there are no published reports of these kinds of phenomena.",
