            "text": "As a genus of viruses in the family Flaviviridae among positive-strand RNA viruses, flaviviruses have more than 70 members, often causing human encephalitis and hemorrhagic diseases. Among these, the mosquito-borne species include important human pathogens such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses, affecting about one-third of the world population, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. Currently, there is no effective antiviral drug available for all flaviviruses, and vaccines are lacking for DENV and WNV. The 10\u201311 kilo-base positive-sense flavivirus RNA genome contains both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) and a single open reading frame that is translated into a large polyprotein. The genome bears a cap 1 structure (N7MeG5\u2032-ppp-5\u2032A2\u2032OMe) at its 5\u2032 end [1], while its 3\u2032 end is not poly-adenylated. The polyprotein is processed into three structural and seven non-structural proteins. Among those, the \u2248900-residue non-structural protein 5 (NS5) comprises an N-terminal S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) domain, and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) region that harbors the classic thumb, palm, and fingers domains present in all single-subunit polymerases. Although MTase is common for viruses bearing a 5\u2032 cap structure and RdRP is required for all RNA viruses, the flavivirus NS5 represents a unique natural fusion of these two important enzymes. However, whether and how inter-regulations and cooperativity take place between the two enzymes of NS5 remain elusive.",

            "text": "Since 2002, the crystal structure of the \u2248260-residue MTase domain has been reported in eight flaviviruses [2]\u2013[4]. The flavivirus MTase is believed to catalyze both the N7 and 2\u2032-O methylation steps, and may also act as a guanylyltransferase (GTase) to form the G5\u2032-ppp-5\u2032A linkage [5], [6], thereby playing key roles in the capping process. In 2007, the crystal structures of the RdRP region (the C-terminal 630 residues) from WNV and DENV were reported [7], [8]. Despite the fact that polymerase motifs F and G were not resolved, these RdRP structures exhibit high degree of similarity to the non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) that represent the other two genera of the family Flaviviridae\n[9], [10]. Different from primer-dependent RdRPs such as poliovirus (PV) 3D [11], [12], these polymerases contain a \u201cpriming element\u201d that partially occupies the putative ds-RNA channel (also termed \u201cfront channel\u201d) and is believed to play an important role in de novo initiation of the RNA synthesis.",

NS5 has also been documented to interact with other viral replication proteins including the non-structural protein 3 (NS3) protease/helicase, and to recruit promoter-like element stem loop A (SLA) in the 5\u2032 region of the viral genome for precise initiation of RNA synthesis [14]. Moreover, NS5 is involved in the importin-mediated nuclear import and exportin CRM1-mediated nuclear export, through its nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export sequence (NES), respectively [15]\u2013[18]. However, the understanding of these NS5-related molecular interactions is greatly hindered by the lacking of a crystal structure of the full-length protein. Nevertheless, two structural models of the full-length NS5 have been proposed. The first model places the MTase domain off the RdRP ds-RNA channel, largely based on reverse genetics analysis [7], and the second model has the two regions loosely associated in a drastically different relative orientation, relying on small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data [19]. With an aim to further the grip on NS5, we have crystallized the full-length JEV NS5 protein and solved a 2.6-\u00c5 resolution crystal structure. The structure provides the first high-resolution snapshot of the flavivirus NS5, elucidates conserved intra-molecular interactions between MTase and RdRP, and paves a way to dissect the versatile functions of NS5 in its natural form.",

The structure was solved through comprehensive molecular replacement trials using multiple search models derived from the flavivirus MTase and RdRP crystal structures [8], [20].

The overall folds of MTase and RdRP are largely consistent with existing flavivirus NS5 crystal structures for individual enzymes (Figs. 1\u20132, Fig. S2A in Text S1). The MTase (residues 1\u2013266) is complexed with the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), the demethylated form of SAM. Unlike previously reported RdRP structures, the RdRP region of NS5 is intact, with motifs F and G completely resolved. The linker is largely seen with only three residues (271\u2013273) not modeled due to weakness of the electron density. The missing of residues 271\u2013273 is not a result of proteolysis since the protein is intact in the crystal (Fig. S1D in Text S1). The distance between \u03b1-carbon atoms of residues 270 and 274 in the model is about 13 \u00c5, at least 17 \u00c5 shorter than any other possible connections in the crystal lattice, thus making the current model unambiguous. Mediated by the linker, the MTase domain is attached to the backside of the RdRP through key hydrophobic interactions (details below), shielding the top-right rim of NTP entry channel (Fig. 1B).",

As with other viral RdRPs, the core polymerase adopts a shape analogous to a cupped right hand, with thumb and fingers rising on sides of the palm. The palm domain is the most conserved part of viral RdRPs, containing two catalytic aspartic acid residues (D536 of motif A and D668 of motif C in JEV NS5) that are absolutely conserved in all single-subunit processive polymerases [12]. The thumb domain of viral RdRP is relatively diverse. In general, RdRPs that initiates via de novo mechanism such as JEV NS5 have a bulkier thumb than those of primer-dependent RdRPs, carrying additional elements (either as insertions and/or C-terminal extensions) that facilitate de novo initiation [7]\u2013[9], [21].

The index finger also contains a nuclear localization signal \u03b2NLS (residues 322\u2013370) that coincides with the suggested NES (residues 329\u2013345) and NS3 binding site [15]\u2013[17], [22], [23]. The highly conserved 20-residue core (residues 345\u2013364) of this region centers at an \u03b1-helix that has been suggested to interact with importin \u03b2 (Fig. 2D) [16]. The middle finger (residues 578\u2013598) includes the second and third strands of the fingers domain 5-stranded \u03b2-sheet, and no specific function has been assigned to this element except for the contribution to the structural integrity of the fingers domain. Interestingly, the flavivirus RdRP middle finger is at least 7\u20138 residues longer than those of other positive-strand RNA virus RdRPs including HCV and BVDV NS5Bs (Fig. 2B/D), thus extruding to the surface of the protein. The ring finger (residues 453\u2013479) includes the NTP binding motif F, containing the fourth and fifth strands of the 5-stranded \u03b2-sheet. In WNV and DENV RdRP structures, the majority of the ring finger is disordered and the authors proposed an alternate main chain path of this region. In our JEV NS5 structure, the ring finger is ordered and intact, forming the roof of the NTP entry channel, a canonical position observed in other viral RdRPs (Fig. 2A/B/D). It is noteworthy that the \u03b2NLS core helix of the index finger, the tip of the elongated middle finger, and the tip of the ring finger, line in a row at the top-right rim of the NTP entry channel, and interact with the MTase intra-molecularly through key hydrophobic interactions (Figs. 2\u20133, and details below). Comparing to other fingers, the pinky finger is relatively bulky and forms one side of the dsRNA channel. In primer-dependent viral RdRPs such as PV 3Dpol, the pinky finger contains a conserved motif G (residues 109\u2013118) that wedges at the +1/+2 kink of the template RNA, and its N-terminal half runs roughly parallel to the upstream template RNA (Fig. 2B) [12]. While the corresponding region is mostly disordered in the WNV and DENV RdRP structures, it is resolved in the JEV NS5 structure (residues 404\u2013412), adopting a conformation consistent with that observed in HCV and BVDV NS5Bs (Figs. 2B, S2B). Although not conserved in sequence even within the Flaviviridae family, this region is structurally conserved among all viral RdRPs (Fig. 2B/D, Fig. S2B in Text S1), likely playing common roles in RdRP-RNA complex stability and/or RdRP translocation through its intimate association with the template strand.",

The second Zn2+ is located between the thumb and motif E in the palm (Fig. 2A, Zn-2), a pivoting region that may be important for the commonly observed relative movement between thumb and palm [24]\u2013[26], and might have regulatory roles to the polymerase as previously suggested [8]. It differs in one coordination partner comparing to that in the DENV structure (H717-C733-E848-C852 vs. H712-C728-H714-C847), while the WNV structure has a disulfide bond (C733-C852) at the same site [7], [8].

As suggested in bacteriophage phi6 RdRP, by using an aromatic side chain (Trp in flaviviruses, Tyr in HCV and phi6) to set up a priming platform through stacking interactions to an initiating NTP, these elements play a critical role in the early stages of genome replication, and are believed to withdraw from the active site upon the growth of the template-product dsRNA during the transition to the elongation phase. The flavivirus NS5 has the priming element as a single loop structure (residues 790\u2013812) connecting two \u03b1-helices of the thumb domain (Fig. 2A/C/D). In JEV NS5, Trp800 and Arg797 in this loop lined up through cation-\u03c0 interactions [28] in an orientation suitable for priming the initiating NTP (Fig. 2C). In contrast to HCV and BVDV NS5B, the C-terminus of JEV NS5 is not a component of the priming platform, as also noted in the WNV RdRP structure [7]. Although the C-terminal 10 residues (896\u2013905) are unresolved in the full-length structure, the nearly 40 \u00c5 distance between residues 895 and 800, and steric hindrance make it unlikely for the C-terminus to reach the vicinity of the active site.",

To its C-terminus, the MTase is connected by a 10-residue linker (residues 266\u2013275) whose sequence is highly variable among genus flavivirus (Fig. 3C).

The core polymerase runs from residue 304 to the C-terminus of NS5, and adopts the canonical viral RdRP cupped right hand conformation with an encircled active site. All seven polymerase motifs (motifs A\u2013G) common to viral RdRPs and reverse transcriptases are properly arranged around the polymerase active site, among which the fingers domain motifs F and G are properly resolved for the first time in genus flavivirus, while the motifs A\u2013E are within the palm domain.

In its crystal structure, the protease domain connected to the RdRP region through a short linker, with minimal interactions between the two modules [31]. The spatial arrangement between RdRP and its N-terminal fused partner is also different. In NS5, MTase approaches the RdRP from the back, in a direction almost aligned with the dsRNA channel, while in 3CD the 3C protease resides at the left wing of the 3D polymerase backside (Fig. 5). In the crystal structure of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) nsp16/nsp10 binary complex, the stimulatory factor nsp10 forms extensive interactions with the nsp16 MTase. Different from the JEV NS5 that has the RdRP approaches almost perpendicularly to the opening of the MTase catalytic cleft, SARS-CoV nsp10 utilized a slightly concaved surface region to integrate itself to the SAM binding pocket and to extend the putative RNA binding groove of nsp16 MTase, thus enhancing the MTase activity [32]. In contrast, flavivirus MTase domain exhibits both the N7 and 2\u2032-O methylation activity comparable to full-length NS5 in methylation assays in vitro\n[5], suggesting that the enzymatic function of the MTase is not much affected by its interactions with RdRP.",

Therefore, NS5 may adopt drastically different conformations under different circumstances. The \u03b2NLS of NS5 contains a highly conserved core (residues 345\u2013364) centers around a helix that is largely occluded by the MTase domain in the full-length structure, making three \u03b2-importin interacting candidates R355/K358/K360 inaccessible. Together with the fact that the NS3 binding site was also mapped to the same region of \u03b2NLS, these observations argue that unraveling of the 1480 \u00c52 MTase-RdRP interface may occur if necessary. Among the two models of NS5 structure proposed previously, the 125 \u00c5-long extended conformation suggested by SAXS data of DENV NS5 may reflect a form, rather than a defined conformation of NS5 with MTase and RdRP disengaged (Fig. 6B) [19]. The radius of gyration (Rg) values of the JEV NS5 structure and the DENV NS5 SAXS model are 31.7 \u00c5 and \u224836 \u00c5, respectively, indicating that these two models indeed differ in compactness. The model based on reverse genetics data places the MTase off the front channel (Fig. 6C) [7].

These two regions are both well resolved in the full-length JEV NS5 but disordered in WNV and DENV RdRP crystal structures. The formation of the MTase-RdRP interface likely makes motifs F and G less dynamic and helps maintain a canonical fold of RdRP, which in turn is beneficial for the initiation of RNA synthesis. Based on the spatial arrangement of the two key hydrophobic arrays P113/L115/W121 and F467/F351/P585, and the GTR pivot (Fig. 4), we postulate that NS5 could also open up the MTase-RdRP interface using GTR as the pivot to turn into a flexible state (Fig. 6 A\u2013B) when interacting with other components of the genome replication machinery or transporters, or at certain stages of RNA replication. However, the existence of other defined conformation or the formation of an alternate interface between MTase and RdRP requires extra experimental evidences. The 10-residue linker not conserved in sequence would provide freedom for the sampling of other possible conformations to some extent, but larger scale rearrangements may require additional flexibility at the MTase-RdRP junction. Several evidences argue that the N-terminal extension (residues 276\u2013303) may play a role in such a process. This 28-residue region is sometimes considered as part of the MTase [5], [33]. The only structural evidence supporting this came from the Wesselsbron virus MTase crystal structure that has the JEV 271\u2013286 equivalent region folded back to the RdRP interacting module [34]. In contrast, all other crystal structures with this region resolved (including the JEV structure in this study) have it integrated to the core polymerase, wrapping around the first strand of the fingers domain 5-stranded \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2A in Text S1). In addition, mutations within the C-terminal four residues 300\u2013303 reduced the polymerase activity only to 40\u201370% [35], suggesting that the N-terminal extension could play auxiliary roles with respect to the polymerase. However, the association of the N-terminal extension with the RdRP may not be robust either. We have mentioned that BVDV NS5B residues 94\u2013113 is structurally analogous to the N-terminal extension of JEV NS5. Although the same mode of interactions between the N-terminal extension and the fingers domain were observed, in the two crystal forms of the BVDV NS5B, one has the N-terminal extension folded with its own RdRP, and the other has it in a domain-swapping arrangement, associating with the RdRP from a second polypeptide chain. Taken together, the versatility of interactions offered by the N-terminal extension may significantly increase the spatial freedom for the placement of the MTase relative to the core polymerase, allowing the two regions to adopt drastically different relative orientations as needed for the sake of enzymatic activities, regulatory reasons, or MTase-RdRP cooperativity. For example, the conformation of the WNV NS5 cooperative model may be achieved with the flexibility of the N-terminal extension (depicted in Fig. 6C). Further efforts in obtaining more high-resolution NS5-containing structures are necessary to test this hypothesis.",

            "text": "The structure-function studies on primer-dependent viral RdRPs represented by PV 3D are greatly benefited from the fact that polymerase elongation complexes can be readily assembled using RNA construct with a template-primer duplex at least 6-basepair in length, so that the elongation process can be dissected independent of the naturally occurring complicated initiation process [12], [36]. In contrast, de novo viral RdRPs undergo an unstable initiation phase that is analogous to abortive cycling of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases and do not prefer primers longer than two nucleotides [37]\u2013[41], making the in vitro assembly of either initiation complex or elongation complex very challenging for structural studies. One major advance in these RdRPs came from the crystal structure of the bacteriophage phi6 polymerase initiation complex obtained by co-crystallization, which started to reveal how these RdRPs utilize their own priming elements to facilitate initiation. Upon the transition to the elongation phase, the priming element of de novo RdRP is expected to withdraw from the active site and reach its destiny that is unknown to date. Recently, a co-crystal structure of HCV NS5B and end-protected template-primer RNA were obtained using a construct with a deletion in the priming element [42]. The structure doesn't resolve the remainder of the priming platform and very much resembles primer-dependent RdRP-RNA complexes [12], [25], [36]. In a separate study, very stable elongation complex was assembled using wild type HCV NS5B and a dinucleotide primer [43]. However, robust in vitro RdRP assays suitable for assembly of RdRP-RNA complex for structural studies have not been established in flavivirus NS5 to date. The full-length JEV NS5 structure presented here would set up an integral framework for such efforts. Together with recent advances in HCV NS5B, the molecular details of RNA synthesis by de novo RdRPs have begun to unravel.",

Implications and hypothesis regarding possible other functional conformations were discussed considering available structural and functional studies.
