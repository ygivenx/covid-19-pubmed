The ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes have lipid packing defects, whereas the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes show tight packing of phospholipids3. Additionally, the phospholipid contents of the ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes differ from those of the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes. Enveloped viruses acquire their envelope lipid bilayers from host cellular membranes4. Consequently, the phospholipid contents of viruses budding through the ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes differ from those of viruses budding through the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes5\u20137. Moreover, the physicochemical characteristics, such as thickness and sturdiness, differ between the ER-NE-cis-Golgi and the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes8,9. Moreover, the sensitivity to hydrolysis by the secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) enzyme has been reported to differ depending on the lipid composition and overall structure10.",

The cells were subjected to fluorescent antibody (FA) staining with respective antiviral antibodies to determine the number of virus-infected cells, which represented the inoculum\u2019s viral titres (cell-infecting units [CIU]/ml). In some experiments, a plaque assay and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay were performed to determine the viral titres of the inocula (plaque-forming units [PFU]/ml and TCID50/ml, respectively).

The dose-dependent inhibition of the viruses by CM-II-sPLA2 is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. HCV, DENV and JEV belong to the family Flaviviridae and are known to bud through the ER membrane11\u201313. Conversely, CM-II-sPLA2 even at a dose of 10,000 ng/ml did not exert significant virucidal activity against Sindbis virus (SINV; Togaviridae)27, influenza A virus (FLUAV; Orthomyxoviridae) and Sendai virus (SeV; Paramyxoviridae)28, which are known to bud through the PM, or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1; Herpesviridae), which buds through the trans-Golgi network (TGN)29. Vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV; Rhabdoviridae), which also buds through the PM30, showed weak sensitivity to CM-II-sPLA2, with an IC50 value of 2,300 ng/ml. The weak CM-II-sPLA2 sensitivity of VSNJV compared to the insensitivity of SINV, FLUAV and HSV-1 could be attributable to the bullet-shape configuration of VSNJV, which might harbour lipid packing defects at the bottom edge of the bullet-shape particles. CM-II-sPLA2 inhibited HIV infection with an IC50 of 5.4 ng/ml. This result is consistent with a previous observation that sPLA2 obtained from bee and snake venoms inhibited HIV entry into host cells without disrupting the HIV particles19.\n",

The ERGIC constitutes part of the ER-NE-cis-Golgi territory and therefore is considered to have similar characteristics with the ER. Rather unexpectedly, we found that CM-II-sPLA2 exerted only marginal, if any, virucidal activity against MERS-CoV, with an IC50 of 10,000 ng/ml. We assume that the exceptionally large petal-shaped spikes that project approximately 20 nm from the virion envelope, which is a characteristic feature of members of Coronaviridae\n31, interfere with the access of CM-II-sPLA2 to the envelope lipid bilayer. Alternatively, a dose-dependent inhibition pattern (see panel (d) in Supplementary Fig. S1) may imply the possibility that there are two groups of MERS-CoV particles: one that is sensitive to 100 ng/ml of CM-II-sPLA2 and another that is resistant to 10,000 ng/ml of CM-II-sPLA2. The latter group may represent viral particles that have budded through the PM, as reported previously32. Further studies are needed to elucidate the issue.",

We examined viral protein synthesis and RNA replication in the infected cells under the same experimental conditions. The results demonstrated that whereas pretreatment of the virus with CM-II-sPLA2 at a dose as low as 1.0 ng/ml almost completely inhibited HCV and DENV infection, post-entry treatment of virus-infected cells with CM-II-sPLA2 even at the 1,000 ng/ml dose did not inhibit viral protein synthesis (Fig. 1a) or RNA replication (Fig. 1b). Notably, pretreatment of cells with CM-II-sPLA2 at 100 and 1,000 ng/ml doses prior to viral inoculation resulted in substantial inhibition of viral replication. This result is consistent with the result shown in Supplementary Table S1. Determining whether CM-II-sPLA2 that bound to (or was taken up by) the cells was released into the medium during viral inoculation to neutralise the infectivity of the inoculum or whether CM-II-sPLA2 treatment induced downregulation of the viral receptor(s) and/or upregulation of the antiviral status in the cells requires further investigation.

For example, viruses budding through the ER (HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus [BVDV]) were reported to contain more phosphatidylcholine and less phosphatidylserine than viruses budding through the PM (FLUAV, VSV, HIV and Semliki Forest virus [SFV])7. This difference is mainly a reflection of the intrinsic chemical differences between the ER and PM1\u20133,8,9. Additionally, the biophysical thickness and sturdiness differ between the ER and the PM, with the former being thin and less sturdy with lipid packing defects in the lipid bilayers and the latter being thick and sturdier with tight lipid packaging3,8,9. Moreover, the envelope proteins of viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridae lie flat across the surface of the lipid bilayer of the virion, which allows sPLA2 to access to lipid bilayers more easily than the lipid bilayers of other enveloped viruses with protruding envelope proteins. These physicochemical and structural differences in lipid bilayers and whole envelopes would account for the specificity of the virucidal activity of CM-II-sPLA2 against different viruses. In this sense, CM-II-sPLA2, and possibly other sPLA2s can be used to examine the budding site(s) of infectious particles of various viruses in more detail.",

Since the substrate specificity of each sPLA2 should differ depending on its intrinsic properties, the specificity of the virucidal activity of each sPLA2 against a given virus is most likely determined by a particular composition of phospholipids and their distributions on the viral envelope. Moreover, the lipid compositions of HCV, WNV and BVDV, which bud through the ER membrane, were reported to differ from that of a typical ER membrane7,36\u201338. Thus, viruses probably modify their intracellular microenvironments, including the physicochemical conditions of the host cell membranes to facilitate progeny virus production.",

HCV, DENV, JEV, SINV, VSNJV, HSV-1, EMCV and CV-B3 were prepared in Huh7it-1 cells53. FLUAV, HIV-1 and MERS-CoV were prepared in MDCK, HEK293T and Vero cells, respectively. SeV was prepared in embryonated eggs. The infectivity of all viruses except HIV-1 and MERS-CoV was determined on Huh7it-1 cells. Plaque assays were performed for SINV, VSNJV and EMCV by cultivating the virus-inoculated cells for 2 to 4 days under overlay medium containing 1% methylcellulose as described previously46 and the viral titres were expressed as PFU/ml. For the remaining viruses except HIV-1, infectivity was determined by a FA method using specific antibodies against the respective viruses, and viral titres were expressed as CIU/ml as described previously,21,42\u201345,48. Briefly, viral samples were serially diluted 10-fold in complete medium and inoculated onto Huh7it-1 cells seeded on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. After virus adsorption for 1 h, the cells were washed with medium to remove residual virus and cultured for 24 h. The virus-infected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with a virus-specific primary antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated respective secondary antibodies for 1 h. Then, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. HIV-1 infectivity was determined by the TZM-bl assay using HIV-1 receptor-expressing HeLa cells, and the viral titres were expressed based on the \u03b2-galactosidase activity as reported previously54. MERS-CoV infectivity was determined by a FA method using a specific antibody55 on Vero cells 24 h after infection and also by a TCID50 assay on Vero cells by cultivating the virus-inoculated cells for 4 days, followed by fixing with phosphate-buffered formalin and staining with crystal violet52. The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 10% (for cell growth) or 2% (for maintenance culture) foetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml) at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator.",
