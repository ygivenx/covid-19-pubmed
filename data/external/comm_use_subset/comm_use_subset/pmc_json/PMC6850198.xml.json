For a comprehensive review of the mechanism of action of bacterial lysates, see Kearney et al 2015 and Esposito et al 2018.21, 30 Immunomodulation with bacterial lysates has been empirically well accepted and used by the medical community for decades for treating RTIs,19 and one of these commercially available compounds (OM\u201085) has been incorporated into various clinical treatment guidelines such as those from the Pan American Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery31 and a European Position (EPOS) paper32 (albeit only for the management of specific chronic respiratory conditions in adults, as studies in children were not comprehensively evaluated) with the highest recommendation grade.

The authors concluded that this epidemiological shift is associated with the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) and also due to the development of more stringent diagnostic criteria.67 Stopping smoking and banning smoking in public places significantly decreased the rate of children's emergency department visits for middle ear infections and URTIs by 6\u20109%, according to a study from Massachusetts, USA.68 Probiotics have been shown to be ineffective in patients with AOM.69 There may be a role for the use of vitamin D, since levels have been shown to be significantly lower in children with AOM compared with controls.70, 71 There is also evidence that the incidence of AOM in children can be reduced using immunity\u2010targeted microbial preparations. For example, the frequency of AOM was assessed as a secondary endpoint in two clinical studies of the bacterial lysate OM\u201085 involving children with recurrent acute RTIs. Bacterial lysate treatment reduced the total number of OM episodes by 68% at 6 months (n = 25 vs 8, respectively)72 and by 79% at 12 months (n = 14 vs 3, respectively)73 compared with placebo. Of note, a randomised controlled Italian study of OM\u201085 for the prevention of URTIs (with AOM as a study outcome) in children with risk factors for URTIs and a history of recurrence is planned (EudraCT: 2016\u2010002705\u201019). Ribosomal bacterial immunotherapy has also demonstrated efficacy in children with AOM. In a study of 84 patients aged 4\u201014 years, ribosomal immunotherapy led to a significantly improved outcome versus placebo on the incidence of fever, as well as the frequency and duration of infectious episodes.74 Ribosomal immunotherapy led to significant improvements in clinical score, immunological parameters, parents' assessment of the patient's symptoms and hearing tests, compared with placebo, in a study of 72 patients aged 6\u201014 years.75 In addition, a meta\u2010analysis of 19 randomised, double\u2010blind studies, including 1215 children, demonstrated a significantly lower need for surgical procedures with ribosomal immunotherapy (1% vs 7% with placebo) in patients with recurrent AOM.76\n",

However, in our opinion, the treatment modalities for CRS in children proposed by the Pan American Association in 2011, the EPOS group in 2012 and an International Consensus Statement in 2016, need some refinement, since some important studies have only been published recently while others were overlooked. Firstly, according to a recent Cochrane meta\u2010analysis evaluating intranasal steroids for CRS in children, there was no effect on disease severity, although symptomatic improvement (nasal blockage, rhinorrhoea, loss of sense of smell and facial pain) was observed.89 Based on these observations, we recommend intranasal steroids as a category Ia/A option for children with recurrent ARS and/or CRS.89 Secondly, in a randomised, double\u2010blind study in 51 children, bacterial lysate OM\u201085 (recommended as a Ia/A option by EPOS for adults with CRS only, as studies in children were not comprehensively evaluated) not only improved CRS symptoms (nasal discharge and obstruction) and reduced the frequency of CRS exacerbations, but they also decreased the number of days with antibiotic use/month, providing long\u2010term prophylaxis.90 Moreover, this study found that the duration of acute episodes was shorter with bacterial lysates than placebo, suggesting an additional value as a co\u2010medication for the treatment of CRS.90 These observations were supported by two other randomised, double\u2010blind studies in children (aged 1\u20109 years) with recurrent ARS,91, 92 highlighting the clinical value of non\u2010specific, immunomodulatory approaches. Table 2 summarises the evidence and recommendations for the management of children with recurrent ARS/exacerbations of CRS as proposed by EPOS, including our own modifications.32 A recent international consensus statement also provided evidence\u2010based recommendations for the treatment of rhinosinusitis.82\n",

In a Cochrane review evaluating zinc and the common cold, which included 18 randomised controlled trials and 1781 children and adults, it was concluded that zinc could shorten episode duration in children and also be used as a preventative measure99; further research should focus on the effect of zinc in patients at a greater risk of developing complications after a common cold. A recent meta\u2010analysis of 25 randomised controlled trials (including 11 321 children and adults) found that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the risk of acute RTIs, with the available evidence assessed as being high quality.100 Although a large number of randomised controlled trials have been performed assessing Echinacea and the common cold,101 the weakness of trial methods and differences in interventions make it difficult to draw conclusions about its effectiveness in children. Similarly, despite a large number of studies and wide variety of available data, according to a systematic review, evidence supporting the use of vitamin C supplementation and the common cold is limited.102\n",
