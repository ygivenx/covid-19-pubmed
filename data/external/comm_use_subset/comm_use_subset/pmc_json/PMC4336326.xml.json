It is worth noting that some of the structural proteins are also important for replication; among these, the nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most intriguing. This multi-functional protein is the major coronaviral protein produced in infected cells [28,30]. The protein forms a ribonucleoprotein together with genomic RNA, which is then inserted into a lipid envelope carrying other structural proteins that are responsible for membrane curvature formation, vesicle scission, and interaction with cellular receptors [31]. The RNA-binding ability of coronaviral N protein is important not only for genome encapsidation, but also for discontinuous transcription and polymerase template switching [32,33]. Furthermore, the protein may also modulate cellular physiology, thereby transforming the cell into a robust virus production plant. The N protein of some coronaviral species can affect cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton organization, gene transcription, and apoptosis induction in infected cells [34\u201338]. Furthermore, the protein enables the virus to avoid detection by pathogen pattern recognition molecules, including Mda5 and RIG-I helicases [39]. This list of functions may not yet be complete, although its current versatility highlights the importance of the N protein.",

The results clearly show that NL63-N occupies a rather unique cellular localization as it is not translocated to the nucleus in any of the cell lines or primary cells examined. Consistently, we did not observe any marked alteration in cell cycle progression in cells expressing the NL63-N. Biochemical analyses revealed that the NL63-N shares characteristics with homologous proteins encoded by the genomes of other coronaviruses. It forms oligomers via its C-terminal domain (CTD) and binds nucleic acids via its N-terminal domain (NTD). Notably, the complete NL63-N protein was rather unstable, whereas the CTD showed exquisite stability.",

The denaturation temperature was estimated at 45.7\u00b0C, with an enthalpy change of approximately 80 kcal/mol (Table 2). However, due to low signal to noise ratio the resulting baseline was variable and these values can only be treated as rough estimates. Nevertheless, the low enthalpy value suggests that NL63-N protein is relatively unstable. Unfolding of the NTD was irreversible and accompanied by protein aggregation (indicated by the exotherm present in the high temperature region of the DSC curve). The transition temperature was 45\u00b0C and the \u0394Hcal was 104.4 kcal/mol.

Irreversibility is a common feature of DSC measurements when the large, multidomain proteins are considered. Irreversibility limits the use of a standard equilibrium thermodynamic analysis. For such a process, the denaturation temperature measured in DSC experiment is significantly lower than that corresponding to \u0394G = 0. In these cases, the Tm (so called operational thermal stability) is kinetically controlled. The simplest model of irreversible unfolding can be described in the terms of kinetic analysis (rate equations) according to general Lumry-Erying scheme:\nN\u2194KU\u2192kD\nwhere K is the equilibrium unfolding constant characterizing reversible unfolding step, k is the first order rate constant describing following irreversible step; N, U and D correspond to native, reversibly unfolded and irreversibly denatured monomer of the protein, respectively. Therefore, D represents a modified denatured state existing in a quasi-two-state equilibrium with the native state [68,69]. In fact, for irreversible denaturation the enthalpy and Tm become only apparent values since both parameters are dependent on the scan rate. The existence of the exotherm on the downhill part of endotherm DSC peak is the obvious evidence for the presence of association-aggregation processes\u2014the most common reason of the protein unfolding irreversibility.",

However, previous studies show that coronaviral N protein has a higher affinity for the viral RNA than non-viral nucleic acids and that only nucleoproteins with coronaviral genomic RNA are efficiently incorporated into new virions [51,70\u201372]. Observed limited binding of the nucleic acids by the complete N protein (data not shown) hypothetically resulted from interaction between the NTD and CTD.

Furthermore, Tang et al. compared the N proteins from SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E [55] demonstrating that they formed oligomers and bound to nucleic acids. Moreover, Lo et al. showed that oligomerization of the 229E-N protein is most likely also mediated by the CTD [57]. Here we show that the complete NL63-N protein and the CTD can self-associate to form dimers and higher order oligomers. The role of aforementioned N-N interaction is, however, debatable, as NL63-N strongly binds nucleic acids during formation of the ribonucleocapsid. It is therefore possible that this interaction may be important for stabilizing and shaping the ribonucleocapsid; however, it may also be important for other N-mediated processes [73].",

To address this problem, we used a vector encoding maxFP-Green-N/NL63-N fusion protein, but found no difference in the subcellular localization of the fusion protein and the native protein [60,76,77]. Also, we found that overexpression of maxFP-Green-N/NL63-N in the cells yielded a staining pattern identical to that shown by the native N protein.
