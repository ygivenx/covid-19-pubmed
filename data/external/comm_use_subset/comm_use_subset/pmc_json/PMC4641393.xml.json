            "text": "All cells are bounded by semi-permeable membranes that consist of lipid bilayers. Eukaryotic cells also possess an elaborate endomembrane system whereas archaea and bacteria, some notable exceptions notwithstanding, lack endomembranes. The integrity of the membrane is essential for the survival of the cell because the membrane maintains gradients of energy, ions and nutrients between the cell and the environment. The membranes of all cells are spanned by diverse integral membrane proteins including energy-dependent transporters, antiporters and channels that are responsible for transport of specific ions or small molecules, and receptors involved in the recognition of various environmental cues. The great majority of integral membrane proteins are anchored in the membrane by hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) helices. The number and orientation of the TM segments determines the topology of the protein in the membrane [1]. Structural characterization of TM proteins is technically challenging and lags far behind the structural analysis of soluble proteins [2\u20136]. Conversely, however, computational prediction of TM helices from protein sequence is relatively straighforward, and several accurate and fast methods for this task have been developed. These methods have enabled detailed computational analyses of membrane proteomes once multiple complete genomes of diverse organisms have become available for comparative analysis [4, 7].",

The fraction of membrane proteins in cellular proteomes is remarkably constant, roughly 20\u201325 %, for a broad spectrum of organisms\u2014from bacteria and archaea to complex eukaryotic organisms [8\u201310]. In other words, the number of TM proteins scales linearly with the total number of genes (and, for bacteria and archaea, with the genome size) and thus fits together with metabolic enzymes in the framework of universal scaling laws of functional classes of genes [11\u201313]. These findings conform to the model of genome evolution that postulates coupling between the evolutionary trajectories of different gene classes [14] and more specifically imply that evolution of membranes is coupled with the evolution of metabolic networks.",

Notable exceptions to this rule include the 6 TM and 12 TM proteins that are over-represented in many multi-cellular organisms, and 7 TM proteins that are extremely abundant in animals [10]. Another general rule is that most TM proteins have both their N- and C-terminal ends facing inwards in the membrane (Nin-Cin)\u2014a topology that appears to be strongly preferred in nearly all organisms, with the major exception being the C. elegans 7 TM receptors that prefer a Nout-Cin topology [16]\u2014although several instances of proteins with dynamic topologies (temporal and evolutionary) have been described [1].",

            "text": "All of the general conclusions on the abundance, distribution, and structures of TM proteins pertain to cellular life forms. However, the most abundant biological entities on earth are viruses not cells [17]. In a sharp contrast to cells, virus particles are not bounded by closed membranes capable of supporting electrical and chemical gradients. Nevertheless, membranes play important roles in viral reproduction including entrance into the host cells [18\u201320], replication that often occurs within membranous viral \u201cfactories\u201d [21\u201326], and egress [27, 28]. Some of these interactions between viruses and membranes are facilitated by cellular TM proteins that are hijacked by viruses, but others are encoded in viral genomes. Despite their importance, the current knowledge of the viral membrane proteome is scarse [2, 3, 5, 6, 29]. The carefully annotated SwissProt database [30] contains information about approximately 3000 viral TM proteins, many of them with unknown function. Of these, only a small number of distinct viral proteins have an appreciable coverage of their TM portions by experimentally determined structures. Often, structural studies are instead performed at low resolution and reveal general trends, e.g. the conservation of secondary structure elements in different classes of holins [27]. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic genome-level analysis of viral TM proteins has been performed so far.",

Notwithstanding the typical fast evolution of viral genomes, many of these proteins have detectable homologs in other viruses [34]. Recently, the evolutionary conservation of protein-coding genes among bacterial and archaeal viruses has been captured in the collection of Prokaryotic virus Orthologous Groups (POGs) that currently includes >4500 gene families [35, 36]. The POGs include orthologous genes from DNA and RNA viruses that infect bacteria or archaea, although nearly 90 % of the genomes and 97 % of the conserved proteins are from the large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, which mostly represent the tailed bacteriophages of the order Caudovirales. This heavy bias towards the tailed bacteriophages appears to reflect the situation in nature because these viruses are indeed the most abundant genome-containing entities on earth [37], outnumbering cells by about ten-to-one [38, 39].",

We find that viruses show the expected dependence between the number of TM proteins and the total number of genes (genome size), but typically encode a much smaller fraction of TM proteins than bacteria and archaea and also show a much greater variance of that fraction. Furthermore, viruses almost exclusively lack more complicated membrane topologies with more than 4 TM segments, with a few exceptions that appear to represent proteins recently acquired from their hosts. These findings imply that viruses do not follow the general scaling laws for functional classes of genes that appear to hold for all cellular organisms.",

In agreement with previous observations, the fractions of TM proteins in bacteria and archaea do not depend on the genome size and vary within the range from 15 to 30 %, with most genomes encoding between 20 and 25 % membrane proteins; the few outliers with TM proportion >30 % are highly degraded intracellular parasites that encode only several hundred proteins (Fig. 2b). Among viruses, the variation in the fraction of TM proteins is much greater, with the majority being <10 % and thus well separated from bacteria and archaea, but a minority encoding a large fraction of TM proteins, within the microbial range and higher (Fig. 2b). Noticeably, the high TM content was found only in viruses with small and moderate (below average) genome size, conceivably due to the large repertoires of non-TM proteins, such as regulators of host cell transcription, translation, and other metabolic activities, in viruses with larger genomes. Presumably, the typically low but widely varying TM content among viruses has to do with the removal of the functional constraints that dictate the nearly constant proportion of TM proteins in cellular life forms.",

Both the number and the proportion of TM proteins in the lipothrixvirus genomes are much lower than those of the other families of archaeal lipid-asscoiated viruses, Ampullaviridae and Fuselloviridae. The viruses of the families Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae share several homologous proteins and similar genome architectures and have been included in the single order Ligamenvirales [42]. Thus, it appears possible that the lipid association of the Lipothrixviridae virion is a relatively recent innovation that evolved after the divergence from the common ancestor with Rudiviridae; alternatively, rudiviruses might have lost the membrane association. To explore these possibilities, we compared the genome organization between Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. In agreement with previous reports, the definition of conserved genes based on shared POGs that was employed here indicate considerable conservation between the two virus families (Fig. 7). Notably, however, the TM proteins are not part of this common heritage. Moreover, many of the genes encoding these largely uncharacterized proteins are not conserved even within their respective families Lipothrixviridae or Rudiviridae (less than a third of TM proteins in Lipothrixviridae are conserved in other virus genomes). Thus, it appears likely that the lipid-association of Lipothrixviridae virions is not a stable feature of this group, but rather is in evolutionary flux and is likely a recently acquired feature (a common feature in prokaryotes and certainly not unexpected in viruses [43]).",

The repertoires of TM proteins in viruses infecting prokaryotes radically differ from those in archaeal and bacterial cells. Unlike cellular organisms in which TM proteins represent a nearly constant fraction in the range of 20 to 25 %, the variation in the fraction of TM proteins in viruses is much broader. The majority of viruses posses less than 10 % TM proteins but a substantial minority are TM-rich, with over 40 % TM proteins in some. Furthermore, there is only weak scaling of the number of TM proteins with the genome size of viruses as opposed to the near perfect proportionality in bacteria and archaea. Finally, viral membrane proteomes consist predominantly of proteins with a single TM, in contrast to the membrane proteomes of bacteria and archaea that are rich in TM proteins with multiple TM segments, in particular 6-TM and 12-TM proteins.",

In cellular life forms, the membranes perform a well-defined suite of essential functions that have to do with energy transformation, ion homeostasis, nutrient transport and signaling. This suite of essential, universal functions dictates the near constancy of the TM protein fraction in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Moreover, the nearly identical distributions of membrane proteins by the number of TM segments in bacteria and archaea imply even more detailed, universal functional constraints. None of these functions are relevant in most viruses, and on the few occasions when such activities are performed by viral proteins, they are involved in virus-host interaction rather than the central process of virus reproduction. Due to the lack of universal, essential membrane functions, viruses show a broad range in the fraction of TM proteins, with most viruses encoding only a few but some showing a greater proportion of TM protein than cellular life forms. A more general implication of these findings is that viruses do not typically obey the universal scaling laws for functional classes of genes that seem to apply in all cellular life forms [11\u201313].",

Clearly, the TM proteins can contribute to virion structure only in those viruses that possess some form of lipid membranes. The observation that all viruses with high TM content also contain lipids in their particles indicates that the involvement of TM proteins in virion morphogenesis is indeed substantial in these cases. Most of the viral membrane proteins supporting virion structure have simple, single-TM architectures. A notable feature that became apparent in the course of this work is the higher prevalence of lipid-containing, TM-rich viruses in archaea compared to bacteria. Whether the greater involvement of membranes in virion structure of archaeal viruses is an adaptation to extreme conditions or reflects other aspects of their lifestyle remains to be determined. The roles of viral TM proteins in host membrane modification are poorly understood but generally fit within the paradigm of virus-host interaction. A well-characterized case are the cyanophages that carry TM proteins of photosystems that boost nutrient production in the infected cyanobacteria [44].",

Among TM-containing proteins, it may offer greater accuracy in predicting the exact number of TM regions that are present [7, 52]. MEMSAT3 also requires a multiple sequence alignment/profile to be constructed for every input sequence. Therefore, MEMSAT3 was run with default parameters on those proteins predicted by Phobius to contain at least one TM region, and the number of TM segments recorded.
