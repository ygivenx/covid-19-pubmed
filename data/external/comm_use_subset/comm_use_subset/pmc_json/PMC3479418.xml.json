Due to the significant economic impact on livestock, a tight disease control is required. However, its high mutation rate contributes to immune escape and the presence of seven serotypes (O, A, C, Asia-1, South African Territories 1, 2 and 3) each containing a large variety of isolates with high antigenic variability.",

However, vaccination does not induce protection against all isolates within one serotype [1]. Protection is related to the presence of high level of neutralizing antibody in serum. However, animals with low levels of neutralizing antibodies can also be protected [2,3]. Furthermore, non-neutralizing concentrations of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can induce protection in mice [4]. Thus, other mechanisms than neutralization could be involved in protection. It has been shown that opsonisation of FMDV enhances phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages in vitro[5]. More recent in vivo data emphasize the potential role of opsonising antibodies in a mouse model, in which protection was mediated in a macrophage-dependent manner [6]. While these studies indicate that immune complexed virus could be eliminated after phagocytosis by macrophages bearing Fc receptors (FcR), other studies also indicate a participation of dendritic cells (DC), at least in vitro. Immune complexes induce the activation of porcine plasmacytoid DC (pDC) resulting in the production of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 [7]. The possible involvement of opsonising antibodies in FMDV immunity was also confirmed with bovine pDC [8].",

By expressing PRR, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and C-type lectin receptors, pDC contribute to the innate and adaptive antiviral immunity [10].

Only the protocols employing either the CD14-depleted and subsequent CD172a-enriched PBMC or the CD3-depleted and subsequently CD4-enriched PBMC permitted the induction of IFN-\u03b1 after stimulation with FMDV O UKG 2001 (Figure 1C).

Figure 4 shows a representative experiment in which immune serum enhanced the IFN-\u03b1 response induced by FMDV O UKG 2001 relative to naive serum.

This indicated that a virus replication cycle is initiated with formation of double stranded RNA, a potential trigger of IFN-\u03b1 responses [5]. Although TLR7 is known to be the main sensor for RNA viruses in pDC, it represents a receptor for single stranded RNA. We were therefore interested to determine the role played by TLR7 in sensing FMDV and FMDV immune complexes. To this end we used the immuno-regulatory sequence 661 (IRS661) representing an ODN inhibitor of TLR7 which had been previously established for human and murine immune systems [19]. We employed influenza virus-stimulated pDC, a known ligand for TLR7 to test the efficiency of IRS661 to inhibit the TLR7 pathway of porcine pDC. As shown in Figure 5, 0.8\u20133.3 \u03bcM of IRS661 inhibited 60\u201370% of IFN-\u03b1 production induced by influenza virus (Figure 5A). We next tested the ability of IRS661 at a concentration of 0.7 \u03bcM to inhibit FMDV-induced pDC activation. FMDV O UKG 2001 was not able to activate pDC in presence of IRS661. When FMDV immune complexes were employed IRS661 inhibited pDC responses by 60\u201380% (Figure 5B). Similar levels of inhibition were also observed with other FMDV isolates (data not shown). The control ODN did not influence IFN-\u03b1 production of FMDV-stimulated pDC (data not shown).",

We also demonstrate that both immune-complexed FMDV and uncomplexed FMDV activate pDC via TLR7. As expected, the responsiveness of pDC to FMDV is possible with more pure populations of pDC but our results also indicate that other factors could be important such as the percentage of other cell types present in the cell culture. The observation that in vivo IFN-\u03b1 responses occur in the early innate phase of the immune response of cattle and pigs [24,25] support the idea of an early activation of pDC by FMDV in absence of specific antibodies and support the in vivo relevance of our data. In fact, in cattle it has been demonstrated that pDC are the source of early IFN-\u03b1 responses [8].",

            "text": "Our study also demonstrates remarkable differences of different FMDV isolates to activate pDC. The reason for the differences in activation of pDC could be either related to the uptake of the virus by pDC or to the function of viral genes such as the IFN antagonist Lpro, the viral proteinase. FMDV interacts with immune and non-immune cells [26]via Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-dependent and RGD-independent mechanisms, after cell culture adaptation to heparin sulphate binding [27]. Certainly, the differences we observed with pDC are not related to a cell culture adaptation of certain FMDV isolates to heparin sulphate binding since all viruses employed in this study had a maximum of three passages. Furthermore, we have compared cell culture adapted heparin-sulphate binding virus to its non-adapted original wild-type FMDV (viruses as described in [17]), and found no differences in the ability to activate pDC (data not shown). On the other hand, the leader proteinase Lpro inhibiting the type-I IFN pathway [28], is variable among serotypes [29] and could contribute to a isolate-specific FMDV counteraction on the IFN-\u03b1 induction in pDC. The potential of some FMDV isolates to consistently induce IFN-\u03b1 also at low MOIs would support this hypothesis. Overall, it is important to note that in comparison to the IFN-\u03b1 levels in response to influenza viruses [21] and CpG [14], FMDV is a poor stimulator of pDC. Nevertheless, considering that IFN-\u03b1 is known to efficiently inhibit FMDV replication in vitro and in vivo[22], it is now important to investigate the relationship of the ability of an FMDV isolate to induce IFN-\u03b1 in vitro and to promote in vivo innate and adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that antibody-dependent internalization of FMDV via the Fc\u03b3RII represents an important pathway to enter macrophages [5] and pDC [7,8]. One of the main objectives of this study was to determine the relationship between opsonisation and neutralization. Non-neutralized serotype-A and Asia-1 isolates could be efficiently opsonised using an anti-O serum while others were not, such as a serotype C isolate. From phylogenetic studies based on VP1 amino acid sequence, which contains the most antigenic site [30], serotypes O and Asia-1 belong to the same branch [27]. Serotypes A and C are more distant, partially explaining our findings [27]. Interestingly, this opsonisation efficiently occurred with serum dilutions similar to those required for neutralization, when antigenically related viruses from the same serotypes were employed. This would indicate that the type of antibodies and their specificities is similar for both functions. However, we also found opsonisation in non-neutralizing conditions contradicting this idea. It could be speculated that opsonising activity is possible at lower avidity compared to neutralization, in which the antibody binding to the virus is in competition to virus binding to the cellular receptor. This competition can only occur indirectly for opsonisation, since the cellular FcR will bind to the Fc portion of the antibody. The observation that opsonisation can occur at similar serum dilutions with a neutralized and non-neutralized virus would favour the presence of non-neutralizing epitopes, which can be conserved between different serotypes. The answer to these questions needs to be addressed using monoclonal antibodies rather than a polyclonal serum such as in the current study.",

Non-neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies could enhance innate immune responses against antigenically less related FMDV challenge strains and restrict their ability to replicate. Furthermore, other FcR-mediated functions such as virus phagocytosis and more efficient antigen presentation of viral antigens to T cells could be promoted. Although this is not sufficient to mediate complete protection against disease, it could limit virus replication, the severity of clinical diseases and transmission within the heard. Future studies are required to determine how such responses correlate to protection (partial or complete), and if this is the case how vaccines can be improved to promote broadly reactive antibody responses able to link innate and adaptive immunity to FMDV via opsonising antibodies.",
