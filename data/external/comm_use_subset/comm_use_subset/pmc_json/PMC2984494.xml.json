Particularly in Chinese populations, mutations of SLC26A4 are found in as many as 13.7% of deaf subjects [5]. Phenotypes associated with mutations of SLC26A4 include deafness at birth as well as fluctuating hearing loss that progresses toward deafness during childhood [6], [7], [8]. The compatibility of SLC26A4 mutations with hearing, although limited to early childhood, provides the imperative to investigate the etiology of SLC26A4 related deafness with the ultimate goal to develop strategies to preserve hearing in afflicted individuals. Toward this goal, the first mouse model, Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 (formerly named Pds\u2212/\u2212), had been developed [9]. Studies using this mouse model have mainly focused on the postnatal development since normal mice acquire hearing during the second postnatal week and since most human patients lose hearing during early childhood. Three synergistic pathophysiological pathways have so far been delineated.",

Most likely, the enlargement is due to a dysfunction of epithelial fluid transport, since Slc26a4 codes for pendrin, which is an epithelial anion exchanger and since the enlargement occurs shortly after the onset of expression [9]. Conceptually, the enlargement could be the result of a net increase in fluid secretion or decrease in absorption. Pendrin itself does not mediate net solute transport, since it transports anions with a stoichiometry of 1\u22361 [16]. Whether and how pendrin contributes to fluid secretion or absorption is unknown. This question is complicated by two issues:",

            "text": "The inner ear develops from an invagination of the ectoderm that forms a vesicular otocyst [22]. At \u223cE10.5, two protrusions begin to extend from the otocyst; one forms the cochlea and the other forms the endolymphatic sac. While the protrusions elongate and coil, in case of the cochlea, the center of the otocyst reorganizes into the vestibular labyrinth. Pendrin is an anion exchanger that is prominently expressed in the cochlea, the vestibular labyrinth and the endolymphatic sac. In the postnatal cochlea, pendrin is expressed in a spiraling sheet of outer sulcus and spindle cells located in the lateral wall [14]. In the vestibular labyrinth, pendrin is expressed in sheets of transitional cells that surround sensory cell patches, and in the endolymphatic sac, pendrin is expressed in mitochondrial-rich cells that are interspersed among the principal ribosomal-rich cells [11], [14], [23]. The onset of pendrin expression differs among the different compartments of the inner ear. In the endolymphatic sac the onset is at E13 and in the vestibular labyrinth and the cochlea at E15 [24]. A dysfunction of fluid transport due to a lack of pendrin expression can be expected to occur after but is not likely to occur before the onset of expression. The enlargement of the cochlear lumen at E14.5 is therefore unlikely due to local cochlear fluid transport. The relationship been the onset of expression and the onset of cochlear enlargement suggests an involvement of the endolymphatic sac. A reduction in fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac presents a conceivable reason for the enlargement of the cochlear lumen. This view is supported by the finding that resection of the endolymphatic sac in Slc26a4+/\u2212 mice led to an enlargement similar to that observed in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

            "text": "The concept that the endolymphatic sac is engaged in fluid absorption is not new although a direct, in vitro, demonstration of fluid absorption is so far lacking. Indirect evidence for an absorptive function comes from the observation that anoxia leads to a rise in the luminal Na+ and Cl\u2212 concentrations [25], [26] and that obliteration of the endolymphatic sac in adult guinea pigs to an enlargement of the cochlear lumen [27]. Investigations of the endolymphatic sac are hampered by the difficulty of access and the heterogeneity of the epithelium, which consists principally of ribosome-rich cells with interspersed mitochondrial-rich cells [28]. Nevertheless, a number of ion transporters have been identified. These include apical Na+ channels [29], [30], apical H+ ATPase subunits [23], [31], [32], basolateral Na+/K+ ATPases [33], basolateral Na+/H+ exchangers [34], [35] and apical as well as basolateral Cl\u2212/HCO3\n\u2212 exchangers including pendrin [11], [23], [31]. The epithelium generates a lumen-positive transepithelial potential that is sensitive to inhibition of Na+ channels, H+ ATPase, Cl\u2212/HCO3\n\u2212 exchangers, Na+/H+ exchangers and carbonic anhydrase [25], [36]. It is intriguing to speculate that the heterogenic epithelium of the endolymphatic sac resembles a frog skin in that it engages in H+ ATPase-driven Na+ reabsorption. Frog skin is comprised of principal cells equipped with apical Na+ channels and mitochondria-rich cells equipped with an apical H+ ATPase and a Cl\u2212/HCO3\n\u2212 exchanger. Highly effective Na+ absorption is powered by the H+ ATPase, which generates a current that drives Na+ absorption through the Na+ channels [37]. The role of the Cl\u2212/HCO3\n\u2212 exchangers is this model is to export HCO3\n\u2212 that is generated by carbonic anhydrase in the process of generating H+ as substrate for the H+ ATPase (Fig. 10). Lack of the Cl\u2212/HCO3\n\u2212 exchanger pendrin would inhibit H+ production by carbonic anhydrase through product-inhibition and a reduce the current that drives Na+ reabsorption.",

The loss of control of cochlea fluid homeostasis by the endolymphatic sac may be the result of the maturation of local cochlear fluid homeostasis. Further, the capacity for Na+ reabsorption in the endolymphatic sac may be higher at E14.5 than at E17. Support for this hypothesis comes from the finding that numbers of mRNA copies coding for the three subunits of the Na+ channel ENaC decline from P2 to P6 of early postnatal development, which is \u223c4 days after E17 [29]. It is conceivable that this decline can be extrapolated to the embryonic phase of development.",

A base-to-apex gradient in developmental maturation is consistent with the cochlea developing from an elongating protrusion of the otocyst, which implies that cells near the base are developmentally more mature than cells at the apex. Cochlear lumen formation could thus be due to a base-to-apex progressing onset of local fluid transport. Alternatively, lumen formation could be aided by the vestibular labyrinth, which matures earlier than the cochlea. For example, the onset of mechanotransduction in vestibular hair cells is at E17, which is \u223c4 days earlier than in the cochlea [38], [39]. The observation that ligation of the vestibular labyrinth caused a reduction of the cochlear lumen at E14.5 but not at E17.5 suggests that cochlear lumen formation is transiently aided by fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth. Fluid secretion in the embryonic cochlea or vestibular labyrinth is poorly understood. Mechanism of ion transport, that are well established in the postnatal cochlea, cannot be extrapolated to the embryonic stage since the adult ion composition of the luminal fluid, which is characterized by a high K+ concentration and low Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations, is established only during postnatal development [12], [17], [18]. Nevertheless, the observation that ligation of the vestibular labyrinth led to a reduction in the cochlear lumen in Slc26a4+/\u2212 and Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice suggests that pendrin does not play a major role in fluid secretion in the embryonic vestibular labyrinth.",

Gap junction mediated signaling between epithelial cells, for example, may be compromised by increased diffusional distances that are inherent to stretched epithelial cells enclosing an enlarged lumen (Fig. 1B). The importance of gap junction mediated cell signaling is underlined by the fact that loss-of-function mutations of the gap junction protein connexin 26 cause deafness at birth. Coincidentally, mutations of connexin 26 are the most frequent cause for non-syndromic hearing loss in children [40], [41]. Further, the enlargement may disrupt signaling between mesenchymal and epithelial cells as shown in the early postnatal cochlea where mesenchymal cells generate thyroid hormone by conversion of the prohormone to the hormone and epithelial cells bear the thyroid hormone receptors that control proper maturation of the cochlea [42], [43], [44], [45]. The enlargement of the cochlea lumen in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice displaces mesenchymal cells and thereby disrupts cell signaling, which leads to local cochlear hypothyroidism during the early postnatal phase of development [10]. Taken together, cell-to-cell signaling is critically important during development of the cochlea. The enlargement appears to disrupt critical cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms at multiple stages, thereby disrupt proper development and account for deafness at birth in mice and possibly human patients.",

The majority of patients bearing mutations of SLC26A4 lose hearing during early childhood - often after a period of fluctuating hearing loss that progresses toward deafness [8], [46]. Based on studies in the Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mouse model, fluctuating hearing loss may be due to oscillations of a negative feedback system that oscillates and generates fluctuations in the endocochlear potential and thereby in the driving force on which hearing depends. This feedback loop is comprised of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by marginal cells of stria vascularis as a byproduct of elevated rates of K+ secretion and the ROS-sensitive K+ channel KCNJ10 that generates the endocochlear potential and supplies K+ to the marginal cells [12], [13]. The ROS-induced loss of KCNJ10 abolishes the endocochlear potential and hearing and the associated reduction in K+ flux to marginal cells would limit K+ secretion, reduce ROS production, allow restoration of KCNJ10 expression, restoration of the endocochlear potential and restoration of hearing. This feedback loop may oscillate and thereby generate fluctuating hearing loss. Irreversible deafness would ensue, when endolymphatic Ca2+ concentrations rise and hair cells succumb to Ca2+ overload [9], [12].",
