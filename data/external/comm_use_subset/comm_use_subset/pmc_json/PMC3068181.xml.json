However, each complex is not exclusive, as PAR6 links PALS1 to PAR3/PAR6/aPKC [3]. In T lymphocytes, cell polarity proteins were shown to partition the leading edge from the uropod at the cell rear, and therefore participate to cell migration, homing, and scanning [4], [5], [6]. In addition, SCRIB and Dlgh1 are transiently recruited to the nascent immunological synapse formed with an antigen-presenting-cell (APC) [4]. Their depletion in lymphocytes has been associated with an alteration of antigen receptor-mediated activation [7], [8], [9], [10].",

Interestingly, Dlgh1 and PALS1 share a COOH-terminal part composed of a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain followed by an SH3 domain adjacent to an inactive Guanylate kinase (GK) homology region [2]. This unique sequence of PDZ/SH3/GK defines the so-called membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins family, a group of molecules that serve as scaffolds to organize multi-protein signalosomes through their protein-protein interaction domains [13]. For example, the MAGUK-containing CARMA1 emerges as a central regulator of lymphocytes activation and proliferation downstream of antigen receptor stimulation [14]. Indeed, CARMA1 operates as scaffold to recruit the heterodimer BCL10/MALT1 (CBM complex), a key step for conveying NF-\u03baB signaling [14], [15], [16]. In addition to its established role in polarity, Dlgh1 was shown to modulate lymphocyte proliferation upon T-cell receptor ligation, possibly through p38 recruitment or via the transcription factor NF-AT [9], [10], [17], [18].",

            "text": "Although several cell polarity proteins have been characterized in lymphocytes [4], [5], PALS1 expression in T cells remains to be determined [8]. To address this question, we first performed RT-PCR analysis on resting human CD3+ T cells and Jurkat lymphocytes extracts, and detected mRNA for PALS1 (Figure 1A). These mRNA were efficiently translated into protein, as antibodies against PALS1 detected a band, which was absent from PALS1-siRNA transfected primary T lymphocytes lysates (Figure 1B). Similar results were obtained with Jurkat T cells (Figure 1B). Of note, PALS1 levels remained unchanged in cells stimulated with antibodies to CD3 and CD28, or with PMA and ionomycin (Figure 1C). We next investigated PALS1 subcellular location by confocal microscopy. In contrast to epithelial cells where it accumulate to tight junctions [12], PALS1 did not reach membrane domains and remains essentially cytosolic with punctuate structures. Additional staining revealed that these structures coalesced with the Golgi apparatus (Figure 1D and Figure S1). Accordingly, Brefeldin A-triggered disassembly of the Golgi apparatus also disrupted PALS1 punctuate structures (Figure 1D). This is reminiscent of PALS1 relocation to the Golgi apparatus in cells infected with SARS coronovirus [19]. Last, we observed that TCR-mediated stimulation only promoted a discrete redistribution of PALS1 within the cytosol of Jurkat cells (Figure S1). Altogether, our results suggest that similarly to Dlgh1, SCRIB, CRB3, and PKC\u03b6 [4], [5], the cell polarity protein PALS1 is expressed in lymphocytes at both mRNA and protein level.",

Primary human T cells were nucleofected for three days with siRNA targeting PALS1, prior stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. PALS1 knockdown led to a significant decrease in TCR-mediated induction of the activation markers CD69 and CD25 on cell surface (Figure 2A, B).

PALS1 knockdown had only a marginal effect on NF-AT activity following stimulation with PMA and ionomycin, or with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 (Figure 3C and Figure S2).

Less NF-\u03baB bound to its specific probe in nuclei extracts from PALS1\u2013siRNA transfected cells following TCR stimulation (Figure 4A). As expected, Oct-1 binding remained unchanged without PALS1. Consistent with a diminished NF-\u03baB activity, both the phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NF-\u03baB inhibitor, IkB\u03b1, were severely decreased in the absence of PALS1 (Figure 4B). Because TCR-induced NF-\u03baB activation relies on the assembly of the CBM complex [15], BCL10 was immunoprecipitated from nonspecific (NS-) and PALS1-siRNA transfected Jurkat cells. MALT1, which forms an heterodimer with BCL10, coprecipitated with BCL10 regardless of stimulation. Although PALS1 was not found bound to BCL10, its absence diminished CARMA1 recruitment (Figure 4C, and data not shown). Hence, our data suggest that PALS1 participates to the optimal translocation and activation of NF-\u03baB upon TCR stimulation, possibly by favoring the CBM assembly.",

Similarly to PALS1, mRNA for PATJ, CRB3, PAR6, were efficiently detected by RT-PCR (Figure 5A). The same hold true for the unrelated cell polarity protein SCRIB (Figure 5A). siRNA-based knockdown of PALS1 and CRB3 significantly decreased NF-\u03baB activation in cells treated by antibodies against CD3 and CD28, or with a mixture of PMA and ionomycin. Although less dramatic, similar results were observed with PAR6 or PATJ knockdown. By contrast, NF-\u03baB was normally activated in the absence of SCRIB (Figure 5B). In agreement, IkB\u03b1 phosphorylation was diminished in lysates from CRB3-depleted cells, and to a lesser extent from PATJ- or PAR6-siRNA transfected cells, and not from SCRIB-depleted cells. Again, ERK phosphorylation occurred normally (Figure 5C, D, E, and F). Altogether, our data suggest that PALS1 implication in the TCR-NF-\u03baB pathway is inextricably linked to its cell polarity partners.",

            "text": "In summary, our data show that the cell polarity protein PALS1 is expressed in lymphocytes and contributes to their optimal activation. Although Dlgh1 and SCRIB were proposed to modulate NF-AT or p38 [9], [10], [17], [18] and NF-AT [7] respectively, a distinct scenario likely occurs for PALS1. Our results support a model in which PALS1 participates to NF-\u03baB activation, upstream of IkB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation. However, how precisely PALS1 modulates NF-\u03baB remains unclear. Because MAGUK function as scaffold units to organize and integrate multi-molecular signaling complexes [13], it is tempting to speculate that PALS1 nucleates its own signalosome. For example, CARMA1 anchors a >900 kDa complex including the heterodimer BCL10/MALT1 [22], and Dlgh1 was reported to bind to Lck, Zap70, Wasp [17], and p38 [10]. In our hands, PALS1 did not integrate the CBM, but its absence reduced CARMA1 binding to BCL10. It will therefore be interesting to identify PALS1 partners in the context of lymphocyte activation. In line with this, CRB3, PATJ and PAR6, which all bound PALS1 to maintain cell polarity [2], also participate to NF-\u03baB signaling upon TCR ligation in lymphocytes, and might therefore complex with PALS1 in lymphocytes. Altogether, our results strengthen the unexpected function of cell polarity proteins in lymphocyte proliferation [7], [8], [9], [10], and unveil an original role for PALS1 during TCR-mediated NF-\u03baB activation.",
