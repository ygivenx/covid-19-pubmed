            "text": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given as standard therapy to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who carry activating mutations in the EGFR gene. The EGFR-TKI gefitinib, when administered to NSCLC patients carrying activating EGFR mutations (e.g., 15-bp deletion in exon 19, L858R in exon 21), significantly improved response and survival [1,2]. Furthermore, these EGFR mutations were predominantly found in patients of East-Asian origin [3]. However, although EGFR-TKI treatment has significant effects on response and prognosis, a study has reported that 40% of patients treated with EGFR-TKI experience severe adverse events, and treatment had to be discontinued in 7.7% of the patients because of unmanageable severe adverse events [4]. Diarrhea and rashes were the most frequent adverse effects but were well-tolerated and manageable. Toxic deaths were rare at 1.7%, and pneumonitis emerged as the most common severe form of toxicity as it accounted for more than half the toxic deaths following the administration of EGFR-TKIs [4]. Based on a retrospective analysis in Japanese patients, the EGFR-TKI treatment-related risk of pneumonitis and mortality are 3.5% and 1.6%, respectively [5]. According to a worldwide meta-analysis, the risk for pneumonitis is at 1.7% and the mortality risk is at 0.5% following EGFR-TKI treatment. The incidence rates for EGFR-TKI treatment-related toxicity are higher among the Japanese than in other races, but the reason why Japanese NSCLC patients are susceptible to EGFR-TKI-induced pneumonitis is not clear. Notably, the incidence of pneumonitis was higher in male patients with smoking history, pre-existing interstitial pneumonitis, and poor performance status, which are considered as grade 3 or 4 by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [3]. However, the biological characteristics associated with EGFR-TKI-induced pneumonitis are yet to be determined.",

It regulates multiple aspects of pulmonary epithelial cell homeostasis in response to injury, including cell proliferation, cell survival, barrier function, and ion transport [6,7]. EGFR and other ErbB family members can be activated by direct interaction with EGF-like ligands. This initiates receptor dimerization and increased kinase activity, which leads to the activation of downstream signaling factors, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways [8]. In addition, EGFR can be transactivated by various extracellular stimuli, such as antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and of cytokine receptors [9]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-13, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 have been reported to transactivate EGFR in pulmonary epithelial cells [10,11,12,13].",

Dysregulation of TNF is implicated in numerous disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, and cancer [14]. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies for TNF have been developed as therapeutics for these autoimmune inflammatory diseases. TNF regulates both anti- and pro-apoptotic signal transduction pathways and maintains balance between these two pathways. TNF-induced anti-apoptotic pathways include PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB), whereas pro-apoptotic TNF induced-pathways include p38 MAPK and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) [15,16,17]. During pneumonitis, inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are released, leading to cell apoptosis, tissue necrosis, and micro-vascular dysfunction [18].",

Our results demonstrate that the administration of an EGFR-TKI, gefitinib, remarkably enhanced lung inflammation in SPC-TNF tg mice, and significantly induced apoptosis of pulmonary cells via the p38 MAPK pathway. Human lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, exhibited EGFR transactivation by TNF via cleavage of heparin-binding (HB)-EGF by TACE and was thereby protected from TNF-induced apoptosis. Although EGFR-TKIs are promising therapeutics for EGFR mutation-positive patients, it should be carefully administered to patients with accompanying COPD, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, and enrichment of inflammatory cytokines.",

In wild type (WT) mice, no significant pathological change was observed (Figure 1a). In SPC-TNF tg mice, administration of gefitinib resulted in severe lymphocytic infiltration in the alveolar septa, and the mice also developed thicker alveolar septa than non-administered mice (Figure 1b). After 14 days of administration, there was also no death related to gefitinib administration. Moreover, there was no change in body weight in either WT or SPC-TNF tg mice (Figure 1c). To determine the inflammatory cytokines that mediate lymphocytic infiltration in SPC-TNF tg mice, real-time RT PCR was performed (Table 2 and Table 3). In wt mice, although mRNA levels for the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 were significantly increased, no inflammation and lung injury was observed, suggesting a maintenance of balance by other anti-inflammatory cytokines, or through an unknown mechanisms. The mRNA level of IL-17\u03b1 was found to be significantly increased by gefitinib administration. Taken together, these results suggest that treatment with EGFR-TKI might cause lung inflammation in SPC-TNF tg mice that overexpress TNF in the lung.",

In WT and SPC-TNF tg mice, we measured whole-lung fluorescence ex vivo using the Clairvivo OPT fluorescence imaging system. We observed slight accumulation of ICG-loaded liposomes in whole lungs of SPC-TNF tg mice that were not treated with gefitinib compared with whole lungs of WT mice. Furthermore, after 14 days of gefitinib administration, accumulation of liposomes was enhanced in whole-lung samples taken from SPC-TNF tg mice.

Anti-apoptotic responses can be mediated by AKT, ERK1/2, or Raf; else, p38MAPK is activated through MKK3/6 phosphorylation, leading to apoptosis [23,24].

TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited by gefitinib, suggesting the necessity of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in this regard. (Figure 4c). Transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against EGFR into BEAS-2B cells led to decreased EGFR expression and attenuated TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation (Figure 4d).

Furthermore, TAPI-1 enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis significantly (Figure 5b and c), suggesting that TACE mediates EGFR phosphorylation, leading to cell survival upon TNF exposure. The major downstream signals from EGFR include the PI-3K/AKT and RAS/ERK pathways. TNF transactivated EGFR by shedding mainly two EGFR ligands, and then we determined the signaling molecules downstream of EGFR that regulate cell survival in the presence of TNF. We used wortmannin and U0126 to inhibit AKT and ERK1/2, respectively. Wortmannin or U0126 alone did not induce apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells. Wortmannin significantly enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis, while U0126 did not affect TNF-induced apoptosis (Figure 5d,e). Therefore, the PI3K/AKT pathway may contribute to cell survival via TNF-induced EGFR transactivation.

To identify the EGFR ligands involved in TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, neutralizing antibodies were employed. As shown in Figure 6b, EGFR-transactivation by TNF was attenuated by the treatment of neutralizing antibodies against HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1. Furthermore, the combination of neutralizing antibodies against HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 exhibited remarkable inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of TNF (Figure 6c). To measure the expression of HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 in the culture supernatant, ELISA was performed. HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 expression in the culture supernatant increased upon TNF exposure; however, the presence of TAPI-1 reduced the expression of these EGFR-ligands (Figure 6d,e). Moreover, knockdown of TACE using siRNA (Figure 6f), reduced the amount of HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 in the culture supernatant (Figure 6g,h). These results indicate that the expression of HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 in the culture supernatant was regulated by TACE and that these ligands were involved in TNF-induced transactivation in BEAS-2B cells.

These findings show that transactivation of EGFR prevents TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis.",

            "text": "TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation regulates critical physiological responses in acute lung injury. Airway inflammation, characterized by the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, induces excessive EGFR signaling [27,28]. High amounts of EGFR ligands, amphiregulin and TGF-\u03b1 secreted by bronchial epithelial cells result in the activation of EGFR in an autocrine loop, leading to increased mucus production by goblet cells [29,30]. Therefore, inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase activity may be beneficial to the treatment of hypersecretory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchiectasis. Conversely, EGFR-ligands EGF or TGF-\u03b1 can regulate lung epithelial cell repair in vitro and in vivo [31,32]. EGFR is overexpressed and activated in response to lung epithelial injury and play an important role in lung epithelial repair [33]. Increased amounts of both TGF-\u03b1 and EGFR have been observed in bleomycin-injured lungs [34]. In addition, TGF-\u03b1 has been identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with acute lung injury [34,35]. Taken together, the expression of EGFR or EGFR-ligands, and EGFR tyrosine kinase activity protect lung epithelial cells from apoptosis and enhance their recovery from lung inflammation and injury [36]. However, further studies are required to discover the role of EGFR and its ligands in inflammatory lung diseases. In this study, EGFR tyrosine kinase was transactivated by TNF in SPC-TNF tg mice. Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase by gefitinib increased TNF-induced apoptosis in epithelial cells and significantly enhanced lung injury. The results of this study are consistent with those of previous reports, which showed that activation of EGFR and other ErbB family members protects colon epithelial cells from TNF-induced apoptosis [20,37].",

            "text": "For understanding the development of pneumonitis in whole lung, it is essential to evaluate lung inflammation by EGFR-TKI gefitinib administration ex vivo. In regions of inflammation in arthritis and tumors, vascular endothelial cells are activated by inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b1 and TNF. Leukocytes roll on the vascular endothelial cells by binding E-selectin on the vascular endothelial cell surface. Leukocytes infiltrate the vascular endothelium, and then migrate and accumulate in the inflammatory region. The sugar chain sialyl Lewis X (SLX) is well characterized as an E-selectin ligand, expressed on the surface of leukocytes. Therefore, SLX-liposomes primarily targeting E-selectin in activated endothelial cells deliver and accumulate their ICG content in regions of inflammation and within tumors [38,39]. Therefore, we employed an SLX-Lipo-ICG to evaluate lung tissue inflammation after administration of gefitinib in WT and SPC-TNF tg mice. The basal accumulation of SLX-Lipo-ICG in SPC-TNF tg mice was higher than in WT mice. Furthermore, after gefitinib administration, the accumulation of SLX-Lipo-ICG was enhanced in SPC-TNF tg mice but not in WT mice. These results indicate that gefitinib remarkably enhances TNF-induced lung inflammation in SPC-TNF tg mice.",

IL-17A appears to act primarily on non-hematopoietic cells, such as endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts [40]. Increased expression of IL-17A has been linked to inflammatory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and COPD in the airway, as well as inflammatory bowel disease, and it appears to play an important protective role against infection [41,42,43]. Iyoda et al. reported that IL-17A and IL-17F can stimulate the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and then enhance the expression of cytokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 in cultured mouse mesangial cells [44]. In the SPC-TNF tg mice, gefitinib treatment led to increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, suggesting that IL-17A may stimulate p38 MAPK activity and induce lung epithelial cell apoptosis.",

A previous clinical study has identified risk factors of EGFR TKI-induced pneumonitis including old age, smoking history, pre-existing interstitial lung disease, and poor performance status [45]. For example, higher plasma concentration of TNF was measured in the older group than in the younger group [46]. Smoking may influence TNF-mediated systemic inflammation, such as in COPD or interstitial pneumonitis [47]. Furthermore, poor-performance status and cachexia, associated with cytokines of IL-6 and TNF, are well known [48]. Taken together, these risk factors are associated with TNF-enriched lung conditions.

EGFR activation prevents TNF-induced apoptosis and severe inflammation. IL-17A was the most upregulated cytokine and may be involved.

This EGFR transactivation by TNF regulates cell survival. Taken together, our findings provide the biological mechanisms underlying EGFR-TKI-induced lung injury. Therefore, our findings suggest that caution will have to be taken prior to administration of EGFR-TKI in NSCLC cases that are associated with high levels of TNF or inflammation. This study has potential limitations. The effects reported are based on SPC-TNF tg mice, which highly express TNF in whole lung. We cannot, however, exclude the effect of other cytokines and signal transductions associated with lung fibrosis; these would be addressed in future research. ",
