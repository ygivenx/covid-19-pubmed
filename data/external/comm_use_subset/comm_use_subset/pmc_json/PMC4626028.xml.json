This outbreak has highlighted the uncertainties surrounding many aspects of ebolavirus virology, including how the virus is transmitted. High mortality and historical case fatality rates, combined with graphic descriptions of the pathology of EVD caused by Ebola virus, have stoked public panic, and a lack of available clinical and public health expertise in treating EVD has led the media to turn to infectious disease scientists for information. This represents a significant involvement in public health efforts by the virology and infectious disease community, on par with the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2002\u20132003 and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [1,2].",

EBOV aerosol transmission is not a given, however, with studies in animal models providing conflicting evidence about the likelihood of transmission [18\u201320]. Even less can be said about the airborne transmission of EBOV between humans\u2014that is, transmission that involves droplet nuclei (<5 \u03bcm) that can remain suspended in the air for prolonged durations.
