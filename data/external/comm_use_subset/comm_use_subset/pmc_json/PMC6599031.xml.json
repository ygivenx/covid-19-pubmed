            "text": "In the 1950s researchers were increasingly frustrated with the presence of disease or infection as an unwanted variable affecting their experiments1. As a result of an international mandate for better quality animals2, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued guidelines for animal housing and husbandry in 19623. Since that time a great deal of attention has been paid to standardizing facilities, light/day cycles, diets, techniques and equipment4. The overall strategy has been to breed animals free of infectious agents, from germ-free stock or caesarean aseptic techniques, then expose the colony to an environment free of selected infectious pathogens (not all) that would otherwise interfere with research objectives2,4. Today, most animal husbandry facilities adopt this specific-pathogen free (SPF) approach and provide certification that a colony or breeding pair is free from common infectious agents that a species is customarily exposed to in the wild. This approach also has additional benefits of cost-saving and ethical benchmarks as it reduces the number of animals used within individual studies. It also aims to improve standardization of animals and the scale of reproducibility (and replicability) among different laboratories around the world working on similar problems and preclinical questions1,4,5.",
