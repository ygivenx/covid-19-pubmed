            "text": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus closely related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that naturally infects numerous wild and domestic feline species. Individual feline species typically harbor genetically-distinct species-specific FIV strains [1\u20133]. Infection with the domestic cat (Felis catus) strain of FIV (FIVFca) results in CD4+ T-cell depletion and pathogenic disease which progresses to AIDS-like immune dysfunction and ultimately death [4,5]. FIV infection and disease in domestic cats bears many similarities to HIV infection and AIDS in humans including similar routes of infection, cell and tissue tropism, clinical symptoms and course of disease [6,7]. Thus, FIV infection of the domestic cat is a useful animal model for studying HIV infection and vaccine development [4,6,8,9]. In contrast, FIV infection of nondomestic felid species has little measurable impact on survival of the natural host [2,10\u201313], but may be associated with long-term immune cell depletion and other disease sequelae [14\u201317]. Cross-species transmission events are thought to be limited by lack of contact between host species and the action of host-specific cellular restriction factors [18]. Experimental infection of domestic cats with a lentivirus (puma lentivirus (PLV) or FIVPco) native to the cougar (Puma concolor) results in productive yet avirulent infection with no detectable T-cell depletion or clinical disease [19,20], providing a model to evaluate mechanisms for restriction of lentiviral cross-species infection. PLV viral load diminishes over time to virtually undetectable levels in circulation and lymphoid tissues with low level infection of the gastrointestinal tract [19]. Intensive sequence analysis of PLV genomes integrated in cat blood cells showed a strong bias toward G-to-A hypermutation [21], a hallmark of cellular cytidine deaminase-mediated viral restriction [22\u201325], suggesting that cellular restriction likely plays a role in control of PLV infection in domestic cats. Thus PLV infection is a model for cross-species transmission of a virus which is not well-adapted to long-term replication in the new host and remains nonpathogenic.",

            "text": "Previously we have studied whether infection of domestic cats with PLV can impart resistance to subsequent infection with virulent FIV [26,27]. Cats infected with PLV 28 days prior to FIV challenge were protected from the marked CD4+ T-cell depletion experienced by cats challenged with FIV alone [26]. PLV/FIV co-infected cats had a unique immunologic profile distinct from FIV single infected cats\u2014including elevated levels of CD8, CD25 and FAS expressing cells and elevated expression of the cytokines IL-4 and IFN\u03b3 [26,28]. In contrast, we did not detect evidence of adaptive immunity to FIV such as neutralizing antibodies or virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells [26]. These data suggest that innate rather than adaptive immune mechanisms are associated with PLV-induced protection from FIV disease. Additionally, examination of FIV population genetics demonstrated that during PLV/FIV co-infection FIV underwent a population bottleneck at approximately three weeks post-infection not observed in FIV single infection [29]. The nature of this bottleneck remains to be determined, but the data are consistent with PLV-induced host restriction of normally virulent FIV. Collectively, these studies suggest that host innate immunity has a role in mediating PLV-induced modulation of FIV infection and disease. However, the exact nature of PLV-induced protection remains to be elucidated.",

In this study we focused on PLV and FIV infection and innate immune response in multiple infected cat tissues at a later chronic infection timepoint (159 days post-PLV infection) for the purpose of detecting changes in infection and immunity which may be specific to important tissue reservoirs of infection and provide insight into PLV mediated protection.

            "text": "We found that PLV co-infection altered the magnitude and variability of FIV infection and innate immunity in tissues compared to FIV single infection\u2014to a remarkable extent considering our analyses were conducted nearly five months following co-infection. While somewhat surprisingly, FIV proviral load tended to be higher in tissues from co-infected versus single-infected animals, viral transcripts tended to be lower in the co-infection state. Comparison of FIV proviral load and FIV mRNA load among single-infected versus co-infected tissues indicated that PLV co-infection limits FIV productive infection (viral mRNA expression) relative to FIV proviral load. Collectively, these data suggest that PLV-induced protection from FIV disease may be at least partially mediated by persistent alterations of innate immunity resulting in limitation of FIV productive infection. It is also possible that restriction of target cell populations via PLV-induced immune activation or alteration of susceptibility for other reasons results in an altered FIV infection landscape. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that viral and cytokine transcription rates were more variable during single FIV infection, and as reported previously, FIV replication in the face of previous PLV infection is highly constrained during acute infection. If during co-infection, FIV is restricted to a cell type with longer half-life that is less permissive for viral replication, we would predict an outcome similar to that observed in this study. These experiments pose a new paradigm for assessment of protective immunity against HIV/AIDS\u2014namely that perturbation of early innate immune parameters and circulating cell phenotype can alter the outcome of a virulent lentiviral infection.",

For each of 12 organs (bone marrow, thymus, spleen, liver, pre-scapular lymph node (LN), mesenteric LN, Peyer\u2019s patch, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colonic LN, and tonsils) we determined the following parameters: PLV proviral load (an indicator of residual PLV infection), FIV proviral load (an indicator of residual FIV infection), FIV mRNA load (an indicator of productive FIV infection), and mRNA expression of the cytokines IL-10, IL-12p40 and IFN\u03b3. To reduce the number of potential analyses resulting from this experiment we used a permutational based multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to examine if there were differences between single and co-infected cats in the data matrix among tissues for each of the parameters above. This test permitted us to evaluate if the overall distribution and amount of provirus, viral mRNA and cytokines differed between single and co-infection. These data are graphically represented in Figure 1 using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots. Of the six parameters investigated by PERMANOVA, the distribution of FIV provirus and IFN\u03b3 significantly differed between FIV single and PLV/FIV co-infected cats (Figure 1). Thus, for these parameters, differences between single and co-infected cats for each individual tissue were examined further using generalized linear models (GLM, Sections 2.3 and 2.4 below).

This test permitted us to evaluate if provirus, mRNA and cytokines of cats with co-infections were more similar to one another than the same measurement in cats with single virus infections. For FIV mRNA and IFN\u03b3 mRNA expression the differences among FIV/PLV co-infected cats were significantly smaller, or more constrained, than the differences among FIV single infected cats (Figure 1). This suggests that PLV co-infection generally constrains productive FIV infection as indicated by limited variability in FIV mRNA expression across the 12 tissues studied.

Intracellular FIV mRNA abundance was therefore measured as a better indicator of active viral transcription. While we did not find a statistically significant difference in total FIV mRNA between single and co-infection, FIV mRNA abundance trended higher for single infection compared to co-infection in 11 of 12 tissues examined (Supplementary Table 1) in contrast to the generally higher abundance of FIV provirus in co-infected cat tissues (Table 1).",

To make this comparison, all possible individual pair-wise combinations of single-infected:co-infected ratios were first calculated for mRNA and provirus (n = 25 in each case). FIV mRNA single-infected:co-infected ratios and FIV provirus single-infected:co-infected ratios were then compared using PERMANOVA, PERMDISP and GLM procedures as described above. When the mRNA single-infected:co-infected ratio is less than the provirus single-infected:co-infected ratio it indicates productive infection (mRNA expression) in co-infected cats is disproportionately more inhibited than infection success (provirus); and vice versa for the opposite pattern. PERMANOVA analysis showed a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the FIV mRNA single-infected:co-infected ratio and the FIV provirus single-infected:co-infected ratio (Figure 4). For individual tissues the mRNA single-infected:co-infected ratio was significantly less than the provirus single-infected:co-infected ratio for liver, pre-scapular LN, ileum and colonic LN and there was a similar trend (p < 0.1) for spleen, mesenteric LN and tonsil (Figure 4 and Table 2).

In this study we confirmed that GI-associated tissues had among the highest PLV proviral loads at necropsy (Supplementary Table 1). We evaluated PLV mRNA load in tissues with proviral loads similar to FIV (GI tissues and colonic lymph node) and compared PLV and FIV proviral load and mRNA load. PLV proviral load from both single and co-infected cats was relatively similar to FIV proviral load in duodenum, jejunum and ileum; and approximately 10-fold lower than FIV proviral load in colonic lymph node (Figure 5a). In stark contrast to this result, PLV mRNA load was 60 to 1000-fold lower than FIV mRNA load in the same tissues (Figure 5b). Thus, PLV mRNA transcripts are present in extremely low abundance compared to FIV mRNA transcripts, suggesting that PLV productive infection is inhibited during chronic infection of domestic cats to a significantly greater extent than FIV infection in co-infected cats.",

In this study we compared viral infection and innate immune response in multiple relevant tissue reservoirs for FIV/PLV co-infected and single virus infected cats. We determined PLV proviral load, FIV proviral load, FIV mRNA abundance and mRNA expression of IL-10, IL-12p40 and IFN\u03b3 for 12 different tissues from cats infected with FIV, PLV or both viruses. Using a multivariate approach we found that distribution of FIV provirus and IFN\u03b3 significantly differed between FIV single and PLV/FIV co-infected cats, while PLV proviral load, FIV mRNA, IL-10 and IL-12p40 did not. Co-infected cats had increased levels of FIV provirus and IFN\u03b3 in several tissues compared to single infected cats. Analysis of data dispersion demonstrated that variability in IFN\u03b3 and FIV mRNA was much more constrained in the co-infected cats than single infected cats, suggesting that these parameters are tightly regulated during co-infection. By comparing the single-infected:co-infected ratios of FIV mRNA to FIV provirus to control for the different scales used to measure these parameters, we found that production of FIV mRNA was inhibited in co-infected cats. Finally, we found that PLV mRNA production was highly restricted, suggesting that PLV itself is subject to inhibition of productive infection. Taken together, these results indicate that PLV infection impacts subsequent FIV infection by upregulation of IFN\u03b3 and alteration of establishment of tissue reservoirs. Both the magnitude and variability of productive FIV infection in multiple tissues was broadly inhibited in the face of prior PLV infection.",

However, most studies of HIV infection in humans are limited to blood samples in which analysis of infection in circulating cells captures only a small fraction of the host infection. Animal models of virulent lentiviral disease provide a unique opportunity to examine infection and immunity in solid tissues which may differ from peripheral blood cells. We examined lentiviral co-infection and innate immune response in lymphoid tissues (bone marrow, thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, pre-scapular lymph node, colonic lymph node and tonsil), gastrointestinal tissues (duodenum, jejunum, ileum and peyer\u2019s patch) and liver. Overall, magnitude of viral infection and cytokine expression did not vary dramatically between lymphoid versus gastrointestinal tissues. Additionally, trends in co-infection versus single infection for FIV provirus and FIV mRNA were generally similar among different tissue types. The three tissues with significant differences in IFN\u03b3 expression between co-infection and single infection (thymus, spleen and pre-scapular LN) were all lymphoid tissue, but there was a similar near-significant trend in the duodenum. Thus, key effects attributed to PLV infection in this study were generally similar over a broad range of different tissue targets of infection. These data imply that possible impacts of PLV on cellular targets for FIV infection and cellular activation are likely mediated through cell subsets present in a wide range of tissue types.",

In this study we found that IFN\u03b3 expression is also increased in multiple tissues of co-infected cats. In addition, we detected increased IFN\u03b3 at 159 days post-infection, which further extends the known duration of innate immune activation in co-infection and suggests that innate immune alterations induced by PLV persist into the chronic stage of FIV infection. Increased IFN\u03b3 expression occurs well beyond the end of apparent active PLV viral replication, as we found PLV to have extremely low mRNA abundance at this timepoint. The role of IFN\u03b3 in protection from feline and human AIDS is not clear [39]. However, Roberts et al. recently demonstrated a positive association between level of IFN\u03b3 in circulation during early infection and lower HIV viral load [40], providing a basis for the idea that IFN\u03b3 may promote protection from virulent lentiviruses. Thus, it is plausible that PLV-induced IFN\u03b3 may mediate activation of cellular defenses which inhibit productive FIV infection and hence reduce CD4+ T cell depletion with effects that last well beyond the initial infection. The reduced variability in IFN\u03b3 expression detected in co-infected cats may be indicative of constraints placed by PLV infection on IFN\u03b3 expression due to alteration of the cell types infected with FIV or activation state of IFN\u03b3-expressing cells. Alternatively, it may be that consistent upregulation of IFN\u03b3 results in reduced sample-to-sample variability. While we chose to focus on IFN\u03b3 as an indicator of pro-inflammatory innate immunity, IFN\u03b1 might also play a role in PLV/FIV host restriction and may be valuable to examine in future studies. The finding that tissue IL-10 and IL-12p40 mRNA expression did not differ significantly between infection groups is consistent with previous findings in PBMC [26], but is interesting since we have detected significantly increased IL-12p40 protein in the plasma of FIV and PLV/FIV infected cats (Britta Wood and Sue VandeWoude, in review), suggesting that mRNA and protein levels may not be tightly coupled for certain cytokines.",

Given these data and the reduced CD4+ T-cell depletion observed in co-infected cats, we were surprised to find that several tissues of co-infected cats had significantly higher FIV proviral load than single infected cats. This finding suggests that: (1) PBMC viral loads may not be indicative of tissue viral kinetics, and (2) the dynamics of FIV infection in the face of PLV infection change over time\u2014a point illustrated by earlier studies of FIV quasispecies during co- and single infection [29].

PLV-induced alteration of cellular activation may have different consequences in different cell types, resulting in reduced or enhanced FIV infection or alterations in target cell availability and phenotype. While the overall levels of FIV provirus are equal or higher in co-infected cats than single infected cats, it still remains a distinct possibility that PLV infection alters the target cell population for FIV and that replication of FIV in an alternate cell type may ultimately lead to reduced CD4+ T-cell depletion. Furthermore, the finding that PLV infection does not reduce, and may enhance, successful FIV infection argues against the possibility of PLV-induced down-regulation of FIV entry receptor/co-receptor as a mechanism of protection since receptor down-regulation would be expected to result in a reduction in integrated FIV provirus. If PLV infection were to limit subsequent FIV infection to a cell type with a longer circulating half-life (i.e., a cell with a memory phenotype) than the cell type preferred in a single infection, it is possible that proviral loads in co-infection could ultimately exceed those of single infection, as noted in this study.",

CD4+ T-cell depletion during lentiviral infection requires productive viral infection and transcription regardless of whether depletion is ultimately driven by direct effects or chronic immune activation [41,42]. Thus, PLV-mediated intracellular inhibition of FIV transcription in multiple tissues may result in reduced CD4+ T-cell loss through a similar process. The exact mechanism underlying this observation is not clear. PLV might induce a state of latency in FIV-infected cells via cytokine regulation, or by redirecting FIV infection into alternate target cells which do not support active viral transcription. Alternatively, PLV-induced activation of cellular restriction factors might play a role in controlling productive FIV transcription. Our finding of extremely low PLV mRNA production suggests that PLV productive infection is restricted at an intracellular level. The finding of abundant G-to-A mutation in PLV genomes in infected cats [21] strongly implicates cellular cytidine deaminase-mediated restriction of PLV infection and suggests that PLV infection activates cellular restriction or cannot restrict basal intracellular restriction factors. The observation that PLV mRNA transcription in gastrointestinal tissues is severely restricted suggests that PLV genomes are defective and/or there is very effective host control of viral replication. While FIV genomes in infected cats did not have an excess of G-to-A mutations, individual hypermutated FIV genomes have been observed [21,29]. This suggests that FIV replication may also be affected, albeit to a lesser extent, by cellular cytidine deaminase restriction.",
