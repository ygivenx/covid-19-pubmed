Emerging pathogens have been defined as those newly recognised infections of humans following zoonotic transmission or those increasing in incidence and/or geographic range [1]. High-profile examples of emerging pathogens include the discovery of the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus from cases of respiratory illness in 2012 [2] and the expansion of the range of Zika virus across the South Pacific and the Americas [3]. The emergence of previously unseen viruses means that the set of known human viruses continually increases by around two species per year [4,5]. Initial comparative studies identified trends among emerging human pathogens, e.g., increased risk of emergence for pathogens with broad host ranges and RNA viruses [6\u20139]. However, more recent comparative analyses have focused on risk factors for specific pathogen traits such as transmissibility [10\u201312]. Here, we focus on understanding the ecological determinants of pathogen virulence, using all currently recognised human RNA viruses as a study system.",

In contrast, human infections with Reston ebolavirus have never exhibited any evidence of disease symptoms [15].

Of relevance here is an ongoing, largely theoretical debate about the possibility of an evolutionary tradeoff between virulence and transmissibility, which has proven challenging to empirically characterise [20\u201322]. We also note that in the absence of coevolution, a zoonotic virus may demonstrate \u2018coincidental\u2019, nonadapted virulence [23,24]. We therefore compared viruses with different levels of transmissibility in human populations. Transmission route is another potential predictor of virulence; higher mortality rates have been observed in earlier comparative analyses for vector-borne pathogens [17] and pathogens with greater environmental persistence [18]. We therefore hypothesised vector-borne transmission or routes with environmental components (e.g., faecal\u2013oral or food-borne transmission) would be associated with higher virulence than direct, contact-based transmission.",

We therefore hypothesised that a narrow host range, and specifically, infection of nonhuman primate hosts, may also predict virulence. Finally, we hypothesised that a broader tissue tropism could predict higher virulence. This idea is largely unexplored, although experimental studies have demonstrated a broader tissue tropism for more virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus [29].",

Disease severity differed between viral taxonomic families (Fisher\u2019s exact, 1,000 simulations, p < 0.001), with Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, and Hantaviridae having the highest fractions of severe-rated virus species (Fig 1).

The virulence risk factors we identify suggest that broadly targeting direct contact or respiratory transmission interfaces within ecological systems and/or tailoring detection assays towards certain virus families (e.g., Hantaviridae) or tissues (e.g., neural tissue) could contribute to a viable strategy to detect future virulent zoonoses.",

We rated viruses as \u2018severe\u2019 if they firstly had \u22655% CFR when data were available (159/214 viruses, including those with zero CFR); otherwise, we rated viruses as \u2018severe\u2019 if they had frequent reports of hospitalisation, were associated with significant morbidity from certain conditions (haemorrhagic fever, seizures/coma, cirrhosis, AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, HTLV-associated myelopathy), or were explicitly described as \u2018severe\u2019 or \u2018causing severe disease\u2019 (S1 Table). We rated viruses as \u2018nonsevere\u2019 if none of these conditions were met. We note that this led to \u2018nonsevere\u2019 ratings for some viruses with clinically severe but rare syndromes; e.g., dengue virus can cause haemorrhagic dengue fever, though this is much rarer than typical acute dengue fever [46,47]. To address this, data were also collected on whether the virus has caused fatalities in vulnerable individuals (defined as age 16 and below or 60 and above, immunosuppressed, having comorbidities, or otherwise cited as being \u2018at-risk\u2019 by sources for specific viruses) and in healthy adults and whether any \u2018nonsevere\u2019 virus has atypically severe strains (e.g., most infections with viruses within the species Human enterovirus C cause mild disease; however, poliovirus, which causes severe paralytic disease, is also classified under this species).

Firstly, primary transmission route was categorised as the dominant route the virus is transmitted by: vector-borne (excluding mechanical transmission), direct contact, faecal\u2013oral, or respiratory transmission. Primary tissue tropism was similarly categorised as the dominant organ system the virus typically infects or targets, specified as neural, gastrointestinal, hepatic, respiratory, circulatory, vascular, or \u2018systemic\u2019 (typical infection within multiple organ systems with no clear, single dominant tropism). However, many human viruses are known from isolation from blood or serum, with no further evidence of specific tissue tropisms (n = 69).

In order to avoid bias from an imbalance between types of viruses assigned to training and test sets, our selection was based on random sampling, stratified by genus\u2013severity rating combinations. We sampled at a ratio of 75:25, i.e., for the four known severe viruses in the genus Ebolavirus, three were randomly assigned to the training set and the remaining one assigned to the test set. If a genus\u2013severity combination contained less than four viruses, all defaulted to the test set. Comparative risk factor analyses were firstly carried out by constructing a classification tree using the R package \u2018rpart\u2019 v4.1\u201311 [52]. Classification trees are a simple form of machine learning models that aim to optimally classify data points into their correct category of outcome variable based on a structure of binary predictor splits.

To prevent overfitting, the tree was pruned back to the optimal branching size, taken as the most common consensus size over 1,000 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation. To validate the predictive power of the classification tree, predictions of virulence rating were generated when applied to the test set. Tree accuracy was then calculated, comparing the proportion of correct predictions compared to literature-assigned ratings (assuming these to be 100% accurate as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 or \u2018ground truth\u2019). Because virulence ratings were imbalanced (i.e., only a minority of viruses cause severe disease, so correct nonsevere classifications are likely to be achieved by chance), accuracy was directly compared to the null model, i.e., a model with no predictors that predicted \u2018nonsevere\u2019 for all viruses. Additional diagnostics of interest (sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and true skill statistic [54]) were also obtained.",

            "text": "Although classification trees have the advantage of presenting an interpretable schematic of risk factor effects and directions, individual tree structures may be sensitive to particular data points and have no intuitive measures of uncertainty. We therefore generated a further 200 partitions of our data into alternative training/test sets using the random stratified sampling procedure described. Then, for each partition, we constructed a random forest, an ensemble collection of a large number of bootstrapped classification trees [55]. Having many predictor variables compared to the relatively limited and fixed number of human-infective RNA virus species, random forests handle such \u2018large p, small n\u2019 data architecture much more easily than traditional regression frameworks [56]. Missing data in all predictors were imputed using the R package \u2018missForest\u2019 v1.4 [57]. Using the R package \u2018randomForest\u2019 v4.6\u201312 [57], random forests were created containing 5,000 individual trees, each built using a bootstrapped sample of training data and restricted to a randomly selected subset of predictors (k = 5) at each branching split. The predictive power of the random forest approach was evaluated by averaging over the test set predictions from all partitions. Receiver operating characteristic curves were visualised and area under curves calculated to directly compare to the classification tree methodology.",

            "text": "Because of their high structuring, random forest models cannot give a simple parametric predictor effect size and direction (e.g., an odds ratio). Instead, potential virulence risk factors were evaluated using two metrics: variable importance and partial dependence. Variable importance is calculated as the mean decrease in Gini impurity following tree splits on the predictor and can be considered as how informative the risk factor was towards correctly predicting virulence. Partial dependence is calculated as the mean relative change in log-odds of predicting severe virulence, which were converted to predicted probabilities of severity associated with each risk factor. Partial dependence describes marginal effects averaging across any influence of other predictors, and, as such, point estimates may not reflect any complex risk factor interactions. Therefore, to test hypotheses regarding virulence risk factors, we present both averaged random forest partial dependence and the less robust but more accessible single classification tree for its ease of interpretation in risk factor structure and directly compare the statistical validity of both methods by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves.
