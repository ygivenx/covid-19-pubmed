However, community structure has been neglected as a possible explanation for multiwave influenza pandemics, in part because it is difficult to detect and estimate [19]. Most studies describing routine human contact patterns have relied on diary- or questionnaire-based surveys [20] or specially deployed wireless sensors [21] and, thus, rarely yield data sufficient for inferring large-scale aggregations. Social networks estimated from electronic \u201ccontacts\u201d (ie, cell phones, social networking websites) have been shown to exhibit community structure at larger scales [22-26], but do not capture the physical interactions through which diseases spread. However, the ubiquity of community structure across these networks suggests that it may be a general hallmark of social networks.",

Q ranges from zero for randomly connected networks to greater than 0.3 for networks with substantial community structure [28]. We used a heuristic method to divide the Montreal network into a set of communities that maximized Q using an algorithm [28] that initially assigned each node to its own community and then iteratively aggregated whichever pair of communities resulted in the largest increase in Q. We identified 1420 distinct communities associated with a Q value of 0.69.",

Each epidemic begins with all nodes susceptible except for a single, randomly selected, infectious node. Nodes remain infectious for a fixed period with arbitrary time units, after which they become recovered for the remainder of the simulation. Transmission from infectious nodes to susceptible neighbors is attempted once per time unit with transmission probability Tcb. We assumed an infectious period of 5 time units because it yielded sufficient temporal resolution to distinguish epidemic waves. Tcb relates to the percolation transmission probability as given by T=1\u2013(1\u2013Tcb)d, where d is the infectious period. We simulated epidemics across 3 transmission scenarios defined by the value of the basic reproduction number, R0, which is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infection in a completely susceptible population: a low R0=1.9, similar to estimates for recent influenza pandemics [31-33]; a moderate R0=2.4, which maximizes the probability of multiwave epidemics and is in the range estimated for the 1918 influenza pandemic in the United States [34,35]; as well as a high R0=7.5, where spread is rapid both within and between communities. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to the length of the infectious period and considered values of 1, 5, 10, and 50 time steps.",

This slowly degraded community structure while preserving the number of contacts for each individual. We selected a fraction f of edges and broke them to form stubs (half-edges still attached to their nodes). Then, the list of stubs was randomized and each sequential pair of stubs was connected. We eliminated newly formed self-edges and redundant edges via edge swaps with randomly chosen edges, leading to randomization of slightly more than the intended fraction of edges (~1.01f). Modeling each community as a semirandom network with the observed within- and between-community degree distributions, we estimated the impact of random shuffling and variation in R0 on the epidemiological proximity of communities. We built 2048 new networks by randomly shuffling from 0.1% of edges (631 edges) to 3% of edges (18,927 edges) in increments of 0.1%.

Under both of these scenarios, multiwave epidemics were possible but relatively infrequent (Figure 3). At an intermediate value, in the range estimated for the 1918 influenza pandemic in the United States (R0=2.4) [34,35], 44.60% (446/1000) of all epidemics exhibited multiple waves and 87.9% (392/446) of these had an initial epidemic wave in community III with a subsequent wave dominated by the 2 larger communities (Figures 4 and 5). When the first wave was dominated by community III, its peak occurred a mean of 27 time steps (SD 7; n=4074) before that of the second wave. When the second wave was dominated by community III, its peak lagged behind the peak of the first wave by a mean of 22 time steps (SD 8; n=572). The relative size of the second wave increased with R0 because community III became epidemiologically saturated more quickly than the other 2 communities (Figures 3 and 4).

Prior attempts to explain these patterns have largely overlooked population structure in favor of dynamic phenomena, such as pathogen evolution or host behavior [14,15,43,44].

The Montreal \u00ceSF network excludes many interactions important to disease transmission, such as those occurring in homes and schools. In addition, some of the colocation contacts in our dataset may not have been sufficient for disease transmission. For these 2 reasons, the \u00ceSF network does not fully reflect the human contact patterns responsible for disease spread; however, it reveals previously uncharacterized urban-scale community structure that may reflect fundamental geographic, economic, and cultural processes that shape physical contact networks.",

For example, in the midst of an outbreak, it may allow public health officials to target interventions toward subpopulations still at risk for significant transmission. Identifying informative indicators of urban community structure, including the insularity estimates proposed in this study, will allow us to construct temporal epidemiological risk maps and target interventions (eg, vaccination) toward highly connected individuals reaching outside their own communities that can potentially serve as bridge superspreaders. In the Montreal network, communities had distinct geographic signatures, suggesting that investigations of community structure may also facilitate the effective placement of surveillance or intervention sites such as vaccination clinics.",
