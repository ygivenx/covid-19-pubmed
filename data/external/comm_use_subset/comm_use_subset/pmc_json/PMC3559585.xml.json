Bocaviruses are unique among parvoviruses because they contain a third ORF between the non-structural and structural coding regions [1]\u2013[2]. The genus bocavirus includes viruses that infect bovine, canine, feline, porcine and some simian species as well as sea lions [3]\u2013[8]. Human bocavirus (HBoV) was first found in children with acute respiratory tract infections in 2005 [1]. It was then detected in children with respiratory tract infections in addition to gastroenteritis worldwide [9]\u2013[12]. The virus exists in four different serotypes HBoV1-4 [1]\u2013[2], [13]\u2013[14]. Although HBoV 1 and 2 were reported in respiratory samples, all the 4 genotypes of HBoV have been identified in children with acute gastroenteritis.",

The prevalence of HBoV ranges between 1.5 to 19.3% [18], [25]. Primary infection with HBoV seems to occur early in life and children between the ages of 6\u201324 months seem to be mostly affected [9]\u2013[10], but older children can also be infected. Newborn children may become protected by maternally derived antibodies [9]. HBoV infections are rarely found in adults [26]\u2013[27]. Lindner et al. detected anti-HBoV antibodies in 94% of healthy blood donors >19 years of age [28].",

Clinical findings for HBoV-positive patients were indistinguishable from those for patients with other respiratory viruses. Previously, HBoV has been detected in samples from patients aged between 5 months and 2 years [1], [29]. Ma et al, speculated that the antibody against HBoV derived from the mother might protect children under 5 months of age from HBoV infection [9], however, we detected HBoV in two cases below 5 months: in a 2-month-old and 4-month-old child (Table 1\u20132) that may indicate the possibility of HBoV infection in very young children.",

In previous studies, none of the nasal swabs obtained from healthy children yielded a positive HBoV test. This suggests that HBoV is not a frequent commensal virus inhabiting the respiratory tract [16], [19]. HBoV infections are frequently present in concomitant with other viruses and often occur in more than 50% of the tested samples [31]. In the current study, only one case was found to be infected only by HBoV as a single virus entity while most of isolates (17/18) showed coinfection with other viral pathogens. The most frequently detected co-pathogens were RSV (13/18; 72.2%), IAV (12/18 cases, 66.66%), respiratory adenovirus (6/18 cases, 33.33%) while only 1/18 (5.5%) case was coinfected with PIV-3 and none was coninfected with PIV-1 (Table 2). It is assumed that the rate and frequency of coinfections may be higher if more viruses were screened. Consistent with other studies [1], [16], the prevalence rate of bocavirus was higher in children under 2 years of age (Table 1).",
