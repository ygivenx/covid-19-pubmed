Laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are also monitored. However, epidemiological data on influenza hospitalizations has been limited, and there is no established statewide surveillance for respiratory viral infections beyond influenza and RSV. In 2010, Arizona began conducting SARI surveillance as part of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Binational Border Infectious Disease Surveillance (BIDS) program with the aim of describing the patterns of disease in a highly fluid border region.

These sites were selected because they routinely receive acutely ill patients and transferred patients from smaller hospitals in the border area. Two hospitals (Tucson Heart and Northwest Medical) had fewer than five participants in the first season and were dropped in future seasons. Of the six hospitals not included, four declined to participate, one was not approached as it serves a retirement community, and one was excluded because it did not have an emergency room.",

Some differences in case definitions or surveillance design (population\u2010based or hospital\u2010based) may explain differences observed in the results. The proportion of SARI cases <5 years that were positive for an influenza virus (11%) was also similar to that found in Thailand (13%) and 15 countries across Africa (10%).8, 15 Besides RSV and influenza viruses, our results also showed that parainfluenza, HMPV, coxsackievirus, and echovirus are important etiologies of SARI in young children, a finding consistent with other studies.12, 13, 14 The finding that 57% of SARI cases had no pathogen detected suggests that other causes (e.g., bacteria) may play an important role in SARI; alternatively, poor or late specimen collection may have contributed to a lower yield in the viruses being detected.",

The similar clinical presentation across etiologies highlights the challenges to clinicians. Despite the frequent detection of influenza viruses, few patients received antivirals and even fewer within the recommended time frame highlighting the need to increase empiric antiviral treatment in severe illness.16 As expected, persons who had a specimen taken earlier in their illness course were more likely to yield a positive influenza result, highlighting the decrease in shedding over time.17 In our surveillance, only three patients had influenza virus detected seven days after the onset of symptoms.",

The high mortality rate may reflect both the older age of our surveillance population (median age 63 years) and the increasing prevalence of underlying disease with age. More than 89% of all SARI patients aged \u226550 years old had preexisting medical conditions and 93% of those who died while hospitalized were \u226550 years old. As has been shown by others, comorbidities such as chronic lung disease, diabetes, and hypertension likely contributed to the poor survival of patients with influenza in our population.18 Although we do not know the reason for the slightly higher SARI mortality in the 2010\u20132011 season, it is consistent with an influenza season that had higher rates of hospitalization in persons \u226565 years. Influenza vaccine coverage in the patients hospitalized with SARI was similar to statewide coverage estimates in Arizona (annual range: 38%\u201342%).19 However, more work can be done to improve vaccination rates overall and in vulnerable populations.",

First, our selection of large, referral hospitals likely biased our sample to more severe cases presenting later in the course of illness. Further, two of the six hospitals in Southern Arizona that were not included may be more likely to see mobile populations as they are physically closer to border. Although the surveillance was intended to be comprehensive within the selected hospitals, it might not have captured all SARI cases that presented at the hospital. Some cases may have not been enrolled due to doctors\u2019 omission or patients\u2019 admission without passing through the emergency ward. Additionally, few children <5 years were enrolled as our sites are not major providers of pediatric care in Southern Arizona. This population might not be representative of the population of Southern Arizona, and its age distribution may underestimate the burden of SARI, especially among children. Also, because we collected information on mortality at the hospital, deaths that occurred in patients discharged to hospices or nursing homes for terminal care were not included. However, we are in the process of analyzing death certificate data to identify deaths associated with the hospitalization in order to get a better understanding of the predictors of mortality and the mortality burden associated with SARI in Southern Arizona. Self\u2010reported characteristics such as vaccination, travel information, and symptoms may be subject to poor recall, but we reduced recall bias by verifying information through medical records review for the two major sites with accessible medical records. Finally, a few of the viral targets were only tested for two of the four years of the surveillance, so the proportion positive may be underestimated.",

The SARI surveillance system described here will continue to yield important information on the etiologies and seasonality of severe respiratory illness in Arizona. This information is important to clinicians who often treat respiratory illness symptomatically. Further, the data suggesting low influenza vaccination coverage suggests that efforts to improve messages on annual influenza vaccination may be needed.",
