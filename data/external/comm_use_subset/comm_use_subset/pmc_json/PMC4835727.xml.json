Other reagents for the assay including MgSO4, betaine, deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and Bst DNA polymerase were also optimized. The final volumes of dNTP (10 mM), MgSO4 (50 mM), betaine (5 M), and Bst DNA polymerase (10 U/\u03bcL) were 0.8, 0.4, 6, and 1 \u03bcL, respectively (Fig. 1e\u2013h). A reaction temperature of 63 \u00b0C was selected for the CPA assays, similar to previous report8. The reaction time was extended by 15 and 30 min on the basis of the optimum experimental conditions to determine the relationship between reaction time and sensitivity. Our results indicated that, when CPA reactions were incubated for 90 min, favorable results were obtained without nonspecific amplification (Fig. 1k). The sensitivity of CPA was higher than that under 60 min (Fig. 1i) and 75 min (Fig. 1j). In addition, amplification results from the optimized CPA assay correlated 100% with those based on gel electrophoresis.",

Recently, a real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method was reported to be easy to operate and simple to read results, and did not require sophisticated instruments910. However, RT-LAMP detects pathogens using reaction-turbidity as an indicator, which is sometimes difficult to determine without an instrument. The test strip result of CPA-NATS offers direct visualization by eyes, and is much easier to be interpreted. A variety of PCR methods have been developed to detect PEDV, such as a nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay11, duplex real-time RT-PCR12, and multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR13, which can detect and differentiate the variant and virulent strains of PEDV currently reported to be circulating in the US. The above mentioned molecular biology methods all need expensive instruments, which limits their clinical applications particularly in field laboratories or on farm.",

It has a good specificity for detection of PEDV with the RT CPA-NATS methods. That is same as previous developed RT-PCR, real time RT-PCR or RT-LAMP101213. By the contrast of RT CPA-NATS and RT-PCR, we found that RT CPA-NATS had a little better effect on detecting PEDV than RT-PCR and meanwhile it had a convenient and cheaper test procedure. In the previous research, ELISA and RT-PCR14, RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR15, RT-LAMP and real time RT-PCR16 were all compared with in virus detection. Different methods detecting the different viruses may show variable effect. Here, we have showed the comparison of RT CPA-NATS with RT-PCR on detecting PEDV. However, the system was incapable of discriminating variants and virulent strains of PEDV. Nevertheless, it offers an excellent tool for initial screening of clinical specimens for PEDV, and should make valuable contributions to the rapid identification of PEDV in order to prevent and control this devastating disease in swine.",
