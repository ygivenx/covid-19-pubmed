Broiler business mainly operates through commission agents, feed dealers, and butchers13. Poultry farmers sell their products through main wholesale markets, small town markets and directly from farm14. Individual stalls are scattered throughout the urban and rural areas; however, in some areas several stalls are located in the same vicinity and collectively comprise a large LBM. These stalls mostly sell commercial broiler and indigenous chicken breeds, but in some markets, quails, turkeys, house sparrows and ducks are also sold alongside broiler birds15. The risk of AIV is higher in these multi-species stalls due to poor biosecurity. Mixing of birds from different sources may also play a role in spread of AIV in these stalls16.",

In Korea, H9N2 viruses were the most abundant AIV isolated from chicken, ducks, and doves from LBMs, accounting for 56% of isolates24. Similarly, in the current study, 82.4% (28/34) of AIV positive pools belonged to the H9 subtype.

Birds coming from mixed sources have more chances of bringing infection to a stall than birds coming from a single source. The source of birds for stall (small-scale backyard farmers, commercial farms, or combination, auction markets etc.) was not proven to be a risk factor for presence of AIV in Indonesia4. However, that study used environmental samples rather than direct swabbing of poultry. Moreover, purchase of live birds/eggs directly from farm also poses a threat to commercial poultry26. The movement of individuals and vehicles between farms and markets might spread the virus mechanically. Our results suggest that purchasing birds from the dealer/wholesaler rather than mixed sources would reduce the risk of H9 AIV infection in retail stalls.",

Presence of these other poultry breeds in LBM has been reported as a risk factor for environmental contamination with AIV29. Indigenous chicken breeds are usually reared in village backyards with low biosecurity and therefore more likely to come in contact with infected wild birds30. These birds can introduce AIV infection through cross-contamination when sold to urban LBRS for cash and mixed in the same cage with commercial broilers birds, which are reared on commercial farms under high biosecurity16. Hence, mixing of different breeds may increase the likelihood of dissemination and genetic reassortment of influenza viruses3 due to variable pathogenicity of AIV in indigenous and commercial breeds31. Differences in the lethality of HPAIV infection among various lines or breeds of chicken have been described previously32.",

For instance, some respondents who did not personally observe the wild birds and rodents in their stalls, might have answered \u201cNo\u201d in spite of other indications of their presence. Moving sick birds to separate cages, may also have been biased towards the null, because stall owners may have been influenced by Hawthorne effect40,41 i.e. their answers are biased by their presumption of the researcher\u2019s expectations. In some instances, recall bias might also have influenced the respondents\u2019 answers.",

A major aim of this study was to facilitate control of AIV in different compartments of the poultry production system in Pakistan by providing baseline data for large-scale surveillance of LBRS and the results could be helpful in developing a risk-based approach for AIV risk reduction in LBRS. Moreover, implementation of recommendations for sourcing birds only from dealers/wholesale markets, keeping birds inside the cages only and avoiding mixing of different chicken breeds in the same cage could reduce the immediate risk of H9 infections in these stalls.",

The survey weighted logistic regression was used to fit the univariable and multivariable models, and prevalence OR with CI95% for each explanatory variable were calculated using the survey package in R software50. Standard model building methodologies were adopted to select each explanatory variable51,52. All tests were two-sided. All variables associated with AIV infection in LBRS with p < 0.25 in the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable logistic regression model. After univariable analysis, selected variables were checked for collinearity using spearman rank correlation. Phi correlation coefficient (\u03d5) for binary categorical variables was calculated53. If there was strong positive correlation (\u03d5 > 0.5) between the variables, the more clinically important and biologically plausible variable from pairs of correlated variables was chosen for the multivariable model.",
