This intricate ecosystem interacts with the adjacent epithelial layer, and the microbes perform metabolic functions, protect against pathogens, and condition the immune system, and through these basic functions, these microbes directly or indirectly affect most of the physiological functions of the host [1, 2]. In recent years, variations in the bacterial community composition have been shown to correlate with infection outcome, inflammatory bowel disease [3], diabetes [4], obesity [5], and depression [6], and fecal microbiome transplantation has become an effective treatment for refractory Clostridium difficile infections and other diseases [7, 8]. The mechanisms of interaction between the gut bacterial microbiome and the host are very complex, and other components also play crucial roles in this process. In addition to bacteria, viruses are also abundant in the gut [9] and have been hypothesized to markedly alter the structure and function of the bacterial community [10\u201312]. Additionally, chronic viral infection can confer increased resistance against pathogenic challenges [13]. Gut virome alteration has been observed in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn\u2019s disease [14]. The recent advent of high-throughput sequencing methods has made it possible to study these communities and their relationships with health and disease in detail [15].",

Transfer of whole virome communities between humans was documented in fecal microbiome transplantation [16], and the difference varied more widely between gut viromes than between gut bacterial microbiomes in humans [17]. However, the relationship between the bacterial microbiome and the virome has rarely been studied, despite its likely medical importance. Previous research has shown close relationships between single viral species and single bacterial species [18, 19], and single viral species could trigger shifts in the bacterial microbiome and the virome [20, 21]. At the same time, enteric bacteria were seen to be required for efficient infection by [22, 23] or suppression of [24] viruses, and the richness of the gut bacterial microbiome had an obvious effect on bacteriophage composition [25]; moreover, the gut virome composition in humans was examined, and bacteriophage diversity was found to be inversely correlated with naturally occurring bacterial diversity in human infants during healthy development [26]. However, few studies have focused on how the whole virome, a diverse community consisting of eukaryotic RNA and DNA viruses and bacteriophages, interacts with the bacterial microbiome.",

We hypothesized that there is a close relationship between the whole gut virome and bacterial microbiome, and the bacterial microbiome could be depleted by treatment with an antibiotic cocktail in rhesus monkeys. We then examined the virome composition to detect the direct effects of the bacterial microbiota on the virome. We performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the fecal bacteria and metagenomic analysis of fecal viromes from rhesus monkeys treated with an antibiotic cocktail. Our results suggest that a majority of bacteria were depleted after the monkeys were treated with antibiotics and that the composition of the whole virome changed drastically. Importantly, alteration of the virome along with shifts in the composition and function of the gut bacterial community and metabolites from gut bacteria may have played an important role in the interaction.",

An antibiotic cocktail containing ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin was administered orally at a dose of 15 mg/kg 3 times per day for 2 weeks. Three healthy one-year-old rhesus monkeys were treated with antibiotics, and fresh fecal samples were collected one day before treatment with antibiotics and 5, 8, and 9 days after treatment with antibiotics and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C for subsequent analysis. Fresh fecal samples from an additional three normal monkeys were collected after the monkeys were treated with antibiotics for 9 days. The bacterial community of each sample was detected by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and the virome communities in the samples collected before treatment with antibiotics and in those collected after treatment with antibiotics for 9 days were detected by deep sequencing. Because metabolome analysis requires 6 biological duplications, the metabolomes of samples collected before treatment with antibiotics and of those collected after treatment with antibiotics for 8 and 9 days were detected by GC-MS and LC-MS. In our analysis, samples collected before treatment with antibiotics were used as the control group, and samples collected after treatment with antibiotics were used as the experimental group.",

To interrogate the functions associated with the response to depletion in the bacterial microbiome, we performed a KEGG prediction analysis of the bacterial microbiome using PICRUSt. We observed significant differences in functional systems along with shifts in the composition of the bacterial microbiome, according to the predictions by PICRUSt. KEGG pathways associated with bacterial toxins were downregulated significantly (Fig. 7a), perhaps as a result of antibiotic treatment. The pathway associated with D-arginine metabolism showed a 9-fold decrease; in contrast, the pathways associated with fatty acid metabolism and tryptophan metabolism showed a 2-fold and 2.6-fold increase, respectively. At the same time, the biosynthetic pathway for ubiquinone and other terpenoidquinones showed a 2-fold increase. Moreover, the glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway exhibited low diversity and a 1300-fold decrease (Fig. 7a).

In our study, the major reason for depletion of the gut bacterial microbiota was treatment with the antibiotic cocktail. The feeding conditions of the rhesus monkeys were stable in terms of their food and water consumption, and blood samples were monitored routinely, showing that there was no infection during the study period (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The bacterial composition exhibited stable and continuous depletion after treatment with the antibiotic cocktail, and we found that the virome composition changed noticeably and was correlated with the shifts in the bacterial community. Moreover, we found that metabolites produced by the gut bacterial microbiome may play a role in the interrelation. In addition, we found that the composition of the rhesus monkey enterovirus group was similar to that of the human enterovirus group [26], and our results may be beneficial for research on the composition of the human virome.",

Of course, the numbers of drug-resistant bacteria are increasing, but we believe that the cocktail of five antibiotics could deplete most of the commensal bacteria in the gut. As expected, the whole gut bacterial microbiome, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (Additional file 2: Figure S2E), was depleted after treatment with the antibiotic cocktail, except for Escherichia-Shigella species belonging to Proteobacteria, which were resistant to the cocktail. Escherichia harbored the most diverse antibiotic resistance genes, including genes resistant to multidrug treatments, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B, \u03b2-lactams, and sulfonamides [49]. We maintained the bacteria belonging to Escherichia-Shigella in plates with the antibiotic cocktail. In the future, we will investigate the specific resistance and antibiotic resistance genes in this bacterium. Notably, our study focused on the interaction between virome composition and the bacterial microbiome in rhesus monkeys and may serve as a model for gut microbiota analysis. Therefore, we used the administration of 5 distinct antibiotics at high dosages and high frequencies for 2 weeks to deplete the whole gut bacterial microbiome. In our results, the richness and diversity of the bacterial community were depleted. Because our study did not involve clinical treatment, the normal dose of antibiotics was not evaluated by our procedure.",

We first characterized the shift in the gut virome by deep sequencing, and the samples were amplified by MDA. MDA is used as a general technique in virome research, especially for DNA virome detection [26]. To a certain extent, the amplification read-out can also represent the virus quantity. However, MDA is not well suited to the detection of RNA viruses. The sequence-independent amplification (SIA) approach is more appropriate than MDA for detecting RNA viruses [55]. In the future, we can use this approach to precisely detect RNA viruses. In this case, we validated the depletion of the virome composition, including DNA viruses, RNA viruses and bacteriophages, by real-time PCR. Although the number of cycles seemed high, these results were verified via three biological replicates, and the results of the no-template control (NTC) were not detected. In addition, we performed serial dilution of the in vitro transcribed RNA of coxsackievirus A16 to generate a standard curve and found that a Ct of 39.96 represents 23 genomic copies (data not shown). In our opinion, these viruses are components of the gut microbiome with low richness and may be involved in host physiology.",

            "text": "The metabolites produced by gut bacteria play very important roles in host physiology [38], although the effects of these metabolites on virome composition have rarely been reported. Glycan [39], glycosaminoglycan [40], quinone [41] and arginine [42, 43] support the inhibition of viruses, while tryptophan [44, 45] and fatty acids [36] promote viral survival. Although most metabolites that can inhibit or promote viruses play roles in human viruses, tryptophan could promote the simian immunodeficiency virus in macaques [45]. In addition, most pandemics originating in animals, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza, could start to appear because of ecological, behavioral, or socioeconomic changes [56]. Many human viruses are zoonotic, and some human viruses, such as human enterovirus 71, can infect animals, especially monkeys [32]. We believe that metabolites play roles in a broad spectrum of viruses and that changes in the metabolites may correlate with depletion of the virome. In our results, the level of quinone, which decreases the abundance of viruses, was increased in the gut metabolome, and the levels of some amino acids that promote the survival of viruses, such as tryptophan, were decreased. Importantly, glycosaminoglycan, which can reduce the populations of various viruses, was noticeably increased in the KEGG pathways of the bacterial microbiome, but we did not measure glycosaminoglycan levels in the present study. It is very difficult to detect glycosaminoglycan by metabolic scanning because glycosaminoglycan has a very high molecular weight. In the future, glycosaminoglycan levels could be measured by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. First, the polysaccharide needs to be dispelled, followed by detection of the monosaccharide to calculate the polysaccharide levels based on the relationships among the monosaccharides in a specific database. However, this process is very complicated, and the database is not sufficiently large at present. By analyzing the relevant data, we found that depletion of bacteria directly promoted changes in the concentrations of some metabolites, which may play important roles in reducing the abundance of DNA viruses.",
