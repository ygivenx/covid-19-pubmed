Although CF affects many organs, the pulmonary manifestations account for over 90% of the morbidity and mortality [1]. Dysfunction of CFTR in CF airway epithelium perturbs the normal regulation of ion transport, leading to a reduced volume of airway surface liquid (ASL), mucus dehydration, decreased mucus transport (MCT), and mucus plugging of the airways, which are hallmarks of early CF lung disease. Failure of effective mucus clearance initiates and exacerbates CF lung disease, resulting in an inability to effectively prevent or eradicate bacterial infection, typically dominated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Persistent neutrophil-mediated inflammation in CF airways further compromises defective clearance and, over several decades, results in airway destruction and fatal decline of lung function.",

Both MCT and cough clearance require sufficient hydration of mucus secretions for effective airway clearance. The currently accepted model for CF lung pathogenesis is that absence of CFTR function leads to ASL volume reduction that results in mucostasis. A logical therapeutic strategy to reverse CF lung pathogenesis would therefore replace CFTR function to CF airway epithelium, restoring ASL volume regulation and MCT. CFTR gene delivery strategies remain a rational approach towards this goal. To date, however, clinical trials in CF patients using CFTR gene delivery techniques have resulted in limited successful gene delivery that is widely considered to be insufficient for therapeutic benefit to CF patients. The fundamental hurdle to these approaches is the low efficiency of CFTR gene delivery to human conducting airway epithelial cells that regulate MCT.",

Importantly, HAE retain phenotypic differences between non-CF and CF airway epithelium, i.e., CF HAE exhibit reduced or absent cAMP-mediated chloride ion (Cl\u2212) secretion, dysregulation of sodium ion (Na+) absorption, excessive ASL absorption, dehydration of secreted mucus, and mucostasis [6]. This model has been predictive of the in vivo efficacy of drug- and gene-based therapeutics in human clinical studies [9]\u2013[16]. In particular, this model has been utilized to determine that currently available gene transfer vectors approved for clinical testing (e.g., adenovirus, lentivirus, AAV, and nonviral vectors) are inefficient at delivering CFTR to sufficient numbers of surface epithelial cells to restore CFTR function or ASL volume for effective MCT. The target number of cells in a ciliated airway epithelium needed to express CFTR for restoration of ASL and MCT is currently unknown.",

Since recombinant PIV can be re-engineered to express large transgene inserts [18], we used PIV to: (1) generate PIV-expressing CFTR as an additional gene (PIVCFTR); (2) test whether delivery of CFTR to CF ciliated cells restored mechanical innate defense, i.e., MCT, to human CF airway epithelia; and (3) determine the numbers of CF epithelial cells requiring CFTR to restore MCT rates to normal non-CF HAE levels. Using CF HAE, CFTR expression levels per cell and numbers of cells expressing CFTR were correlated with correction of ion transport, ASL volume regulation, and MCT rates to assess the relationship between gene transduction and restoration of normal mucociliary transport. We show that PIV-mediated delivery of CFTR to ciliated cells of CF HAE resulted in functional CFTR channel activity with restoration of ASL volume homeostasis and MCT. Further, we show that CFTR expression in individual ciliated cells does not require tight regulation of expression and that restoration of MCT rates to those measured in non-CF HAE required CFTR delivery to at least 25% of surface epithelial cells or approximately 30% of ciliated cells. Hence, we describe the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of efficient CFTR gene delivery to CF ciliated airway epithelium that is sufficient to correct the fundamental physiological dysfunctions that precipitate CF lung pathogenesis.",

Immunolocalization of PIV-mediated GFP and PIV F expressed by PIVGFP or F glycoprotein expressed by PIVCFTR confirmed targeting of ciliated cells (Figure 2C and 2D). Quantitation of lumenal cells infected by PIVGFP or PIVCFTR revealed that similar numbers of ciliated cells were infected by each virus (Figure 2E). Although ciliated cell numbers were variable in HAE derived from different donors (range 60% to 80%), the percentage of ciliated cells per square centimeter of epithelium surface area determined by \u03b2-tubulin IV immunodetection showed that on average approximately 70% of surface cells were ciliated cells.

However, when low viral titers (103 PFU) were used to inoculate HAE, evidence of further rounds of infection (i.e., spread) was not apparent until 48 h pi [17]. To determine whether the high efficiency of ciliated cell infection by PIVCFTR was dependent on spread of progeny virus from ciliated cell to ciliated cell, we compared infection rates at 24 h versus 48 h pi. HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR (106 PFU) for 2 h showed similar high infection rates at 24 h pi as for 48 h (2-h data for Figure 2F vs. 2E), indicating that the initial high titer inoculum and not cell\u2013cell spread of virus mediated the highly efficient targeting of ciliated cells by PIV. Prolonging or decreasing inoculation times to 8 h or 5 min produced modestly increased or decreased infection rates, respectively (Figure 2F). The high numbers of PIVCFTR-infected cells with only 5-min inoculation time highlight the high efficiency of PIV infection and suggest that short exposure times in the airways will be sufficient for efficient targeting of ciliated cells in vivo.",

Since PIVCFTR produced 10-fold fewer progeny virions than PIVGFP due to the insertion of the relatively large CFTR insert (Figure 2H), it is likely that the generation of inflammatory mediators is proportional to the rate of PIV replication in ciliated cells.",

Previously, it has been estimated that human airway cells contain only approximately 10 CFTR transcripts/cell [19]. In our experiments, we found that CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR produced a 236-fold increase in CFTR mRNA when compared to cultures inoculated with PIVGFP or mock (Figure 3A). Since this large-fold increase in CFTR mRNA is in part reflective of the low endogenous copy number of CFTR, we also assessed CFTR protein levels semiquantitatively by western blot. CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR expressed large amounts of mature CFTR (Figure 3B, lane 3, band C), whereas no mature CFTR protein was detected in CF HAE inoculated with vehicle alone (lane 1) or PIVGFP (lane 2). Serial 10-fold dilutions of total protein lysates of CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR (lanes 4 and 5) provided a semiquantitative measurement of the amounts of exogenous CFTR protein in CF HAE compared to CFTR protein levels in non-CF HAE (lane 6). We estimate that an approximately 50-fold increase in mature CFTR protein in transduced CF HAE was achieved compared to non-CF HAE. Therefore, two independent measures of CFTR abundance indicate a significant overexpression of both CFTR mRNA and protein in transduced CF HAE. Note, these measures are likely an underestimate given that not all ciliated cells are infected by PIVCFTR. Because approximately 60% of ciliated cells were infected in these experiments, and ciliated cells on average comprise approximately 70% of surface cells within a culture, we estimate that individual infected ciliated cells likely overexpress CFTR protein by at least 100-fold over non-CF ciliated cells.",

In CF HAE infected with PIVGFPCFTR, CFTR was immunolocalized only to ciliated cells that were also positive for GFP (Figure 3Ci) and concentrated in apical membrane domains at the base of the cilial shafts. Although endogenous CFTR in non-CF ciliated cells in vitro is localized to these regions [3], subapical membrane CFTR immunoreactivity was also detected after PIVGFPCFTR, likely suggesting the increased presence of CFTR in recycling endosomes. Infection of CF HAE with PIVGFP alone showed that ciliated cells positive for GFP were negative for CFTR immunoreactivity (Figure 3Cii). When non-CF HAE were infected by PIVGFPCFTR, endogenous CFTR was present in GFP-negative ciliated cells and overexpressed in GFP-positive cells (Figure 3Ciii).

Figure 3D shows bioelectric short-circuit current (I\nsc) traces obtained in Ussing chamber experiments with CF HAE inoculated with mock (vehicle alone), PIVGFP, or PIVCFTR. For comparison, a I\nsc trace from a non-CF HAE is also shown. Whereas I\nsc responses to Fsk were not observed in mock- or PIVGFP-inoculated CF HAE, CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR exhibited rapid and sustained increases in I\nsc that were rapidly inhibited by a CFTR-specific inhibitor (CFTR172\n[20]). Experiments using CF cells derived from four different donors revealed that the kinetics and magnitudes of the Fsk responses in PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE were indistinguishable from those observed for non-CF HAE (Figure 3D and 3E; range 6.7\u201342.0 \u00b5A/cm2 for PIVCFTR, 0\u20131.5 \u00b5A/cm2 for CF HAE controls [mock and PIVGFP] and 7.8\u201370.3 \u00b5A/cm2 for non-CF HAE). An additional control using PIV expressing the nonfunctional CFTR mutant \u0394F508CFTR (PIV\u0394F508) confirmed that functional CFTR was required for bioelectric correction of CF HAE (Figure 3E). These data show that delivery of functional CFTR to CF ciliated cells fully restored maximally stimulated CFTR anion channel activity to normal non-CF levels.

Addition of CFTR172 to apical surfaces 15 min before or during Fsk-induced anion secretion resulted in rapid and complete inhibition of secretion (Figure 4A).

As shown in Figure 4B, Fsk responses in CF HAE overexpressing CFTR and non-CF HAE were similar under conditions of physiological Cl\u2212 secretory driving forces (KBR). Importantly, when the apical membrane Cl\u2212 secretory driving force was made large and not limiting by lumenal Cl\u2212 substitution, Fsk again stimulated similar responses in CF HAE overexpressing CFTR compared to non-CF HAE (Figure 4B, HKLC). These observations strongly suggest that overexpressed levels of CFTR do not produce reduction in Cl\u2212 secretory driving forces that offset the additional quantity of CFTR in the apical membrane and hence buffer the Cl\u2212 secretion rates. As an additional control, UTP-mediated Cl\u2212 secretion (via calcium-activated Cl\u2212 channels) was increased >20-fold in HKLC bathing solution compared to KBR (Figure 4C), indicating that the maximal anion secretory capacity of cultures had not been reached.",

We speculate that this ceiling reflects the limiting requirement of the number of potential apical membrane docking sites for CFTR and/or the limited amount of accessory/regulatory proteins localized at apical membranes of CF cells required for CFTR function. It is likely that CFTR insertion into the apical membranes of ciliated cells is tightly regulated with recycling and replenishment of CFTR governed by CFTR-rich recycling endosomes. To determine whether limited availability of docking sites or accessory proteins was unique to CF ciliated cells, non-CF HAE were inoculated with PIVCFTR and PIVGFP, and Fsk responses compared (Figure 4D). Overexpression of CFTR in non-CF HAE provided only moderately increased Fsk-mediated Cl\u2212 secretion compared to cultures inoculated with PIVGFP. Although modest but significant differences in resistance were measured before/after Fsk treatment in mock-treated non-CF HAE, no significant differences in resistance were measured before/after forskolin treatment after PIVCFTR versus PIVGFP inoculations: (Resistances [\u03a9.cm2] before/after Fsk: Mock, 550\u00b149/401\u00b10.5; PIVGFP, 452\u00b139/402\u00b10; PIVCFTR, 419\u00b112/401\u00b10.2; n = 5 for each).

We investigated whether expression of CFTR in CF ciliated cells corrected both the Cl\u2212 secretory and Na+ hyperabsorptive phenotype of CF HAE by measuring responses to specific antagonists on transepithelial potential difference (Vt) with microelectrodes under thin-film conditions when the height of the ASL was at steady state. Measurement of the basal contribution of Cl\u2212 transport to Vt by blocking basolateral membrane cellular Cl\u2212 entry with bumetanide (10\u22124 M) showed that 40% of the Vt in non-CF HAE was accounted for by Cl\u2212 ion transport (Figure 5A, white bars). In contrast, in CF HAE, there was no detectable bumetanide-sensitive Vt, consistent with the absence of functional CFTR (black bars). However, after PIVCFTR, but not PIVGFP, the contribution of Cl\u2212 transport to CF HAE Vt was indistinguishable from that for non-CF HAE (approximately 40%, red bars). These data obtained under thin-film conditions confirm that delivery of CFTR to CF ciliated cells fully corrected the Cl\u2212 secretory defect to non-CF levels.",

The change in Vt, in response to the Na+ channel blocker, benzamil (10\u22125 M), indicated that Na+ transport accounted for approximately 40% of the total Vt in non-CF HAE (Figure 5A, white bars) and approximately 80% of transport in CF HAE (black bars), consistent with a Na+ hyperabsorptive phenotype for CF airway epithelia. Expression of CFTR, but not GFP, in CF ciliated cells significantly reduced the contribution of CF HAE Na+ transport to levels measured in non-CF HAE (Figure 5A, red bars). These data show that delivery of CFTR to CF ciliated cells restored both Cl\u2212 secretion and the regulation of Na+ absorption by CF airway epithelia to normal, non-CF HAE levels. The simplest conclusion drawn from these data is that ENaC and CFTR both reside in ciliated cells in the human airway epithelium.",

In CF HAE, the rotational flow is abolished due to ASL depletion, mimicking mucostasis described for CF airways in vivo [6]. To determine whether expression of CFTR in CF ciliated cells could prevent mucostasis, CF HAE were inoculated with PIVCFTR, PIVGFP, or mock and, 24 h later, a small bolus of 1-\u00b5m fluorescent beads added to the apical surfaces and cultures maintained at >95% humidity for 24 h. For control CF HAE, rotational flow of beads was rarely observed at 48 h pi (Figure 5D, 5Ei, and 5Eii), i.e., mucostasis occurred. In contrast, PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE exhibited significant rotational flow of beads, indicating that MCT had been restored (Figure 5D and 5Eiii). Under these conditions at 48 h pi, PIVCFTR restored approximately 50% of the MCT measured in parallel non-CF HAE (Figure 5D and 5Eiv). These data are the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that MCT can be restored to CF airway epithelia by delivering CFTR to ciliated cells, indicating that the cumulative effects of CFTR deficiency on mechanical innate defense can be reversed by this strategy.",

Experiments to determine the duration of PIVCFTR-mediated bioelectric correction showed that significant functional correction was maintained for at least 1 wk with detectable, but decreased, levels of function remaining at 21 d pi (Figure 6A). Previously, we have shown that PIV-infected ciliated cells are shed from HAE 3\u20137 d pi by a poorly understood process of extruding infected ciliated cells from the epithelium onto the lumenal surfaces of HAE [17]. This process likely represents an innate defense function of the epithelium to rid itself of PIV-infected ciliated cells. To confirm that PIV-infected ciliated cells were being shed from the epithelium, we assessed the cellular composition of apical secretions 6 d after PIVGFP inoculation. By morphologic and immunodetection of GFP-positive cells and ciliated cells, we determined that PIV-infected ciliated cells were shed into apical secretions at a rate far exceeding that of natural ciliated cell shedding (Figure 6B). Therefore, the temporally related loss of CFTR functional activity in PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE likely reflects shedding of infected ciliated cells and suggests that the extent of correction is directly related to the numbers of ciliated cells expressing CFTR. To further explore this relationship, we counted the numbers of PIV-positive cells present in CF HAE over time and show that the loss of PIV-positive ciliated cells paralleled the loss of Cl\u2212 transport (compare Figure 6C to 6A), suggesting that the magnitude of correction was indeed directly proportional to the number of CF ciliated cells expressing CFTR.",

For MCT, approximately 40% of cells (50% of ciliated cells) required CFTR expression to approach MCT rates measured in parallel non-CF HAE. These data identify the efficiency of epithelial cell CFTR delivery to restore defective MCT in CF HAE. Of note is the observation that although PIVCFTR was able to restore MCT to nearly normal levels, MCT, unlike ASL height, was not fully restored. This discrepancy is likely related to the cytotoxic effects of PIV infection on MCT, but not ASL measurements. In these experiments, performed 24 h after inoculation, MCT restoration is much improved over that measured at 48 h pi (Figure 5D), further suggesting that 48 h, but not 24 h, of infection with this prototypic PIV vector had detrimental effects on MCT. These data, taken together with those indicating that overexpression of CFTR on a per cell basis was not detrimental to ion and fluid transport processes, indicate that gene delivery vectors capable of targeting at least 25% of the surface airway epithelial cells will be sufficient to restore ASL height regulation and MCT to levels comparable to those exhibited in non-CF airway epithelia and that precise regulation of CFTR levels at least in ciliated cells is not required.",

Abnormal ASL homeostasis in CF airway epithelium is due to dysregulated Na+ and Cl\u2212 ion transport [35], both consequent to the absence/dysfunction of CFTR at the apical membrane [24]. Here, we have demonstrated that delivery of CFTR to ciliated cells restores Cl\u2212 secretion and reduces the Na+ hyperabsorption characteristic of the CF airway epithelium in vitro and in vivo, providing confirmatory evidence that CFTR functions as both a Cl\u2212 channel and regulator of ENaC within ciliated cells. Further, we have demonstrated that correction of the ion channel defects of CF HAE restores the integrated physiology required for ASL regulation, which ultimately restores MCT (shown schematically in Figure 7G).",

These in vivo studies measured mucus velocities only in the trachea, whereas CF lung disease likely initiates in the more vulnerable, smaller bronchiolar airway regions.

These data agree with previously published reports in which CFTR was transgenically overexpressed in mouse airway epithelium without deleterious results in terms of cell or organ toxicity [22]. However, in this transgenic study, CFTR was overexpressed in Clara cells and alveolar type II cells of the mouse lung, and so our study represents the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of the functional safety of CFTR overexpression in human ciliated cells.

Lentiviral-based vectors pseudotyped with Ebola, influenza virus, baculovirus, Sendai, or SARS-CoV envelope proteins efficiently transduce airway epithelial cells in vitro and murine airways in vivo [48]\u2013[53], suggesting that combining useful envelope glycoproteins with the potential longer duration of gene expression afforded by lentiviruses may provide novel vectors for lung gene transfer strategies. Similar vectors can be envisioned using the glycoproteins of PIV to target lentiviruses to human ciliated airways. However, to date, none of these vector systems have progressed to functional studies after delivery of CFTR to human ciliated airway epithelium, and no demonstration of correction of the CF phenotype (e.g., ASL height or MCT) has been reported.",
