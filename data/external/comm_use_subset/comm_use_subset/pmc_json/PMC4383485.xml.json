            "text": "Astroviruses were first identified by Appleton and Higgins in 1975, in association with an outbreak of infantile gastroenteritis in a maternity ward in England [1] and the Astroviridae family today contains viruses which infect more than 44 animal species [2]. Human astroviruses (HAstV) are recognized as common viral pathogens causing gastroenteritis in infants and young children, with very few reports of HAstV-mediated disease in normal healthy adults, and some reports of severe disease after dissemination to extra-intestinal tissues in immunocompromised patients [2,3]. Astroviruses are non-enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses containing a 6.8 kb polyadenylated genome linked to a VPg protein on the 5\u2019end [3,4]. The genome contains three overlapping open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a and ORF1b encode the viral protease and polymerase, respectively, and ORF2 encodes the capsid precursor [3]. The nonstructural proteins (nsPs) are translated from the genomic RNA as two large polyproteins, nsP1a and nsP1a/1b, through a translational frameshifting mechanism. Upon translation, nonstructural proteins participate in transcribing a full-length negative strand RNA, which serves as the template for the transcription of a new genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Subgenomic RNAs are then used to express capsid proteins. RNA transcription takes place in replication complexes assembled in close association with intracellular membranes which are thought to derive from the endoplasmic reticulum [5], and variability within the hypervariable region (HVR) contained in the C-terminal nsP1a protein (nsP1a/4) may affect the levels of genomic, subgenomic and antigenomic RNAs produced during infection, as well as the level of viral shedding in stools [6].",

            "text": "Despite the impact of astroviruses on human and animal health, very little is known about the mechanisms of pathogenesis [7,8], or the immune response to infection [8,9]. Both in humans and in some studied animals, astrovirus-infected intestines show relatively minor histological changes and inflammation, suggesting that major destruction of the intestinal epithelium and inflammatory responses do not play a role in AstV pathogenesis. Instead, it has been postulated that diarrhea may be caused by disruption of the absorptive/secretory function of the intestine and loss of intestinal epithelial barrier permeability [10,11,12]. In addition, the acute nature of the gastroenteritis, the short duration of symptoms, and the occurrence of most symptomatic infections in young individuals who may lack acquired immunity, strongly suggest that innate immune responses may play a key role in controlling virus replication and limiting disease in humans, especially in primary infections. Innate immune responses have been shown to contribute to the control of viral replication in vivo in infected turkeys and mice [13,14]. Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that complement factor C3 found on the surface of icosahedral viruses such as HAstVs can be internalized by the host cell and trigger cellular innate immune responses [15]. However, compared to other non-enveloped viruses, the level of complement-mediated innate immunity activation upon HAstV infection is substantially weaker, and this would be explained by the fact that the capsid protein of HAstV acts as a complement activation inhibitor [16,17,18].",

            "text": "The innate immune system forms the first line of defense against invading viruses, limiting initial virus replication and ensuring survival of the host until a full, specialized adaptive response is developed. Type I interferons (IFNs) are secreted key cytokines that protect uninfected cells and stimulate leukocytes acting at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity [19]. Tissue cells recognize invading viruses mainly by intracellular pathways [20]. In the cytoplasm, some viral molecules such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or RNAs bearing a 5\u2019-triphosphate group are detected by cellular pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene 1) or MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5). These activated receptors trigger a signaling cascade that activates MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein) and results in the phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF-3, a member of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family. Phosphorylated IRF-3 moves into the nucleus where promotes transcription of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. Secreted IFN-\u03b2 binds to the type I IFN receptor which is present on virtually any host cell and activates IFN signaling via the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway, resulting in the activation of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) which inhibit virus multiplication at the level of transcription, translation, genome replication, assembly, and exit, and stimulate the subsequent adaptive immune responses. Virtually all viruses studied to date have developed means to counteract or minimize the induction, signaling, or antiviral actions of the IFN responses [19,21].",

Briefly, viruses were pretreated with 10 \u03bcg of trypsin (GIX Sigma) per ml for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and were diluted in MEM 0% FBS in order to obtain the multiplicity of infection (MOI) required for each experiment. CaCo-2 cell monolayers were washed twice with MEM 0% FBS and inoculated with the virus. After a 1-h adsorption at 37\u00b0C, cells were washed once and MEM 10% FBS was added in order to ensure a single cycle of viral replication. Infectious titers of stocks were determined by a cell-culture RT-PCR method previously described [22], and by immunofluorescence analysis of infected monolayers. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and rotavirus (RV) SA11 (ATCC VR-899) were grown on HeLa and MA-104 cells, respectively, and infectious viral titers were measured by TCID50 assays on Vero cells and MA-104 cells, respectively.",

IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels induced by HAstV peaked at 48 hpi but were 3.2-fold lower than those induced by polyI:C transfection (Fig 2A). Since transfection efficiency of CaCo-2 cells is low and polyI:C transfection only resulted in 6 \u00b1 0.7% of cells with nuclear IRF3 producing IFN-\u03b2 mRNA (Fig 2C), when comparing the total levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA produced by polyI:C-transfected cultures to the levels produced by infected cultures, it would seem that in these latter cultures, either each infected cell produced very low levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA or that IFN-\u03b2 mRNA would only be produced by a few number of infected cells. Co-staining of viral structural proteins and IRF3 showed that only 2 \u00b1 0.2% of HAstV-infected cells had nuclear IRF3 at 24 hpi (Fig 2B and 2C).

The percentage of infected cells was calculated in each well by an immunofluorescence assay and image analysis of 5 fields. It did not reach 100% in any case, even when using a MOI of 10, probably due to the fact that viruses were not pre-activated with trypsin before infection. As shown in Fig 7A, significant reductions in TER levels were only achieved in wells where more than 10% of cells in the monolayer were infected, and a positive correlation was also observed between percentage of TER reduction and level of IFN-\u03b2 response (Fig 7B).

Our findings demonstrate that HAstV infection does not induce a strong type I IFN response, as evidenced by the fact that IFN-\u03b2 mRNA is only detected once viral replication has taken place and at low levels. When comparing the levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA produced in infected cultures with a high proportion of infected cells, with those produced in polyI:C-transfected wells, it seems that either each infected cell produces very low levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA or that only a low proportion of infected cells produce a higher amount of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA. Consistent with this latter idea, only a low percentage of infected cells show translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus, suggesting that IFN induction does not take place in each infected cell. Although it cannot be completely ruled out that IFN-\u03b2 synthesis may occur independent of IRF3 activation, our working hypothesis is that IFN-b mRNA would not be produced within every infected cell. In addition, nuclear translocation of IRF3 occurs at late times post-infection, and antiviral activity in the supernatant of infected cells is not detected until 48 h after infection, confirming that in any case, IFN production takes place at the late stages of the viral replication cycle and requires infectious viruses. Finally, when we examined the ability of HAstV to inhibit the IFN response induced by polyI:C transfection, we observed that HAstV infection is not able to block the ability of the cell to respond to dsRNA as it has been observed for other well-studied ssRNA viruses [21]. HAstV behavior would be more similar to what has been described for some other viruses such as rhinovirus [34] or mouse hepatitis virus [35].",

            "text": "Taken together, our results may be explained by the observation that HAstV capsid acts as an inhibitor of complement activation [16,17,18], and that intracellular uptake of complement factors bound to viral particles may trigger innate immune responses within cells [15]. Since FBS was added to the post-infection medium in all experiments, it is plausible that the activation of innate responses was delayed due to the action of the HAstV capsid limiting deposition of complement factors on the viral surface. In addition to this, other mechanisms may also contribute to minimize IFN production within HAstV-infected cells. Although active antagonists of the type I IFN response have been characterized for other well-studied gastroenteritis viruses such as rotavirus [32, 33], as reviewed in [19], viral countermeasures to limit cellular antiviral responses may also be achieved by several mechanisms such as tightly controlling virus transcription and replication to minimize the production of dsRNA, encapsidating all forms of viral RNAs produced within the cell, protecting the 5\u2019 end of their RNAs with a cap structure or a VPg protein from recognition by RIG-I, or by replicating within intracellular membrane vesicles to \u201chide\u201d any viral RNA from the cytoplasmic cellular innate recognition machinery. Recent work in our laboratory has experimentally confirmed that HAstV genome is covalently linked to a VPg protein on its 5\u2019 end [4], and large membrane rearrangements can be observed in HAstV-infected cells, with virus aggregates surrounded by double-membrane vacuoles [5,36]. Indeed, HAstV assembly seems to start at cellular membranes, at the same site where nonstructural proteins replicate the genome. Cell fractionation studies have shown that both positive and negative HAstV RNAs and also nonstructural proteins localize in vesicles where capsid protein gets anchored after synthesis [36].",

In addition, exogenous IFN is able to partially reduce viral replication and drug inhibition of IFN signaling enhances virus replication, suggesting that HAstVs may be regarded as IFN-sensitive viruses. Indeed, innate responses have been shown to play a role in controlling AstV replication in available animal models. In turkeys, AstV primary infections are controlled by the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the subsequent increase in its innate immune mediator NO [14], and in mice, AstV replication in the intestine and viral shedding are significantly higher in Stat1-/- animals than in wild-type mice [13]. Both the Jak/Stat1 pathway and iNOS activity have been shown to be important for the control of other viral gastroenteritis agents such as noroviruses [37], which are also sensitive to exogenous IFN [38]. Also recently, type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb) have gained importance as key mediators of antiviral immunity for intestinal infections [39]. Although IFN-\u03bb activates the same antiviral pathways as type I IFNs, they act through a different receptor that is primarily expressed on the gastrointestinal and other mucosal epithelia. Interestingly, IFN-\u03bb determines the intestinal epithelial antiviral host defense against acute rotavirus infections [40] and persistent infections associated to murine noroviruses [41], and its therapeutic potential has been experimentally proven in mice. Although we still do not know whether IFN-\u03bb may also be critical to control HAstV infections, we have confirmed that synthesis of IFN-\u03bb mRNA takes place within HAstV-infected CaCo-2 cells (data not shown), and future experiments in our laboratory will aim at characterizing this response at the cellular level.",

            "text": "Besides the complete elucidation of the mechanism used by HAstVs to attenuate the cellular type I IFN response, it would also be important to examine whether an interplay occurs between the expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA and the activation of apoptosis. Within CaCo-2 cells, apoptosis has been shown to be required at the late stages of infection for maturation of HAstV capsids and cellular caspases play an active role in the release of virions from infected cells through a non-lytic mechanism [42,43]. Although some motifs found in nsP1a are potential apoptosis inductors [42], apoptosis may also be a consequence of the cellular IFN response. Action of type I IFN within a cell promotes the expression of more than 300 interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), more than 15 of which have pro-apoptotic functions. Additionally, in certain cell types, some of the cellular players in the IFN signaling pathway may also activate caspases and apoptosis, independently of IFN [44,45,46]. In our study, when IFN response was inhibited by BX795 inhibitor, we observed a 2-fold increase in viral RNA and infectious titer, but 4-fold increase in total capsid protein measured by an end-point dilution ELISA assay (Table 1), suggesting that inhibition of IFN allows the virus to replicate to higher titers, but also results in a high proportion of capsids which may not have been properly assembled, encapsidated and/or matured. Although further experiments should be performed, it is plausible that at late stages of infection HAstV may take advantage of the cellular IFN response activation to trigger apoptotic signals and specific caspases required for their late steps of capsid morphogenesis and virion release from the cell.",

            "text": "Finally, we report different levels of IFN-b activation upon infection with HAstV mutants differing in their nsP1a/4 gene. Previous experiments in our laboratory described that different nsP1a/4 variants correlate with differences in viral replication phenotype in cell culture as well as in virus shedding in patients [6,47]. Here we have shown that compared to HAstV-VI and HAstV-XII, HAstV-IV is able to replicate in CaCo-2 cells up to higher titers without inducing such a strong cellular innate response. Although these experiments were done including FBS in the culture media and this could be activating innate responses through complement deposition on viral particles, either input particles or de novo produced particles, our hypothesis is that either directly or indirectly nsP1a/4 genotype influences the level of IFN response induced within cells. Consistent with this idea, viral stocks produced in the laboratory in the absence of FBS for HAstV-IV have higher viral titers than stocks produced for the other genotypes (data not shown), and clinical isolates corresponding to genotype IV have been associated to persistent gastroenteritis [47]. Thus, although the link between nsP1a/4 variability and IFN response may be indirect, our results highlight that variability within nsP1a/4 protein may have clinical implications in terms of pathogenicity and the potential role of nsP1a/4 protein as an antiviral target.",
