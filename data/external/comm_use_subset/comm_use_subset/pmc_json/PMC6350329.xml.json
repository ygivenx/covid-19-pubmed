PRRSV infection leads to severe morbidity and mortality worldwide; the main clinical manifestations are reproductive disorders, such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and the delivery of mummified fetuses in pregnant sows, as well as respiratory symptoms in pigs of various ages (particularly piglets) [2, 3]. PRRSV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus with a genome of approximately 15.4 kb that includes at least 9 open reading frames (ORFs); ORF1a and ORF1b encode nonstructural proteins (NSPs), and ORF2-ORF7 encode structural proteins [4, 5]. These NSPs are involved in viral replication and play key roles in regulating genomic transcription [6]. Among these NSPs, NSP3 and NSP5 are predicted to be transmembrane proteins and NSP9 possesses viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity [7]. PRRSV is usually grown in Marc-145 cells, which originated from monkey kidney epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Autophagy occurs in eukaryotic cells and is a process by which cell homeostasis is maintained through the degradation of proteins and organelles [8, 9]. Generally, autophagy is triggered in cells stimulated with external factors, such as starvation or viral infection; the marker of autophagy is the formation of autophagosomes [10]. The integrated autophagy course primarily comprises three processes: first, the formation of autophagosomes; then, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes; and last, degradation of the cargo in lysosomes. The first step of the autophagy process is that a membrane possibly derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) elongates, becomes curled, and then surrounds part of the cytoplasm, followed by the degradation of organelles, proteins and other cellular components. In this process, two proteins, namely, ATG12 and ATG5, form complexes via ubiquitin-like conjugation [11, 12]. Furthermore, ATG16 interacts with the ATG12-ATG5 complex to form the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 protein complex, which plays a significant role in forming autophagosomes [13]. Finally, lysosomes fuse with mature autophagosomes to form autophagolysosomes; the contents of the autophagosome are degraded, and the substances inside the autophagolysosomes are delivered to the cytoplasm for transformation into amino acids and energy for cytoplasmic metabolism [14].",

The ER is the main site of protein synthesis, lipid production and calcium ion storage in eukaryotic cells. A variety of proteins in the ER must be folded, assembled, processed, packaged and transported to the Golgi apparatus [16]. Once the cells are stimulated with internal and external factors, the balance between ER morphology and function is affected by the changes in molecular biochemistry. Protein processing and transport are blocked, and a large number of unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, leading to the unfolded protein response (UPR) [17\u201319], which operates through three signaling pathways that play significant roles in regulating autophagy during viral infection [20, 21]. The ER stress response was recently shown to be induced by PRRSV infection, leading to the activation of JNK signaling pathways [22].",

The HCV polymerase NS5B was recently reported to colocalize with NS4B and interact with ATG5 to initiate autophagosome formation [25]. In addition, HBx promotes autophagy and prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to maintain the accumulation of solutions in the autophagosomes [26, 27]. Recent studies examining the relation between autophagy and PRRSV revealed that PRRSV induced incomplete autophagy and that autophagy enhances the replication of PRRSV [28\u201330]. Additionally, PRRSV infection promotes mitochondrial fission and activates apoptosis [31\u201333]; however, few studies have examined the relations between PRRSV NSPs and autophagy to date.",

As shown in Fig. 1a and b, compared to the accumulation of GFP-LC3 puncta in the cytoplasm of mock-infected cells, the accumulation of these puncta in the cytoplasm of HBSS-treated and PRRSV-infected cells suggested that PRRSV induced the formation of autophagosomes. LC3 conversion is a hallmark of autophagy; therefore, the conversion of LC3 was assessed by immunoblotting and the levels of LC3II/LC3I were examined to assess the induction of autophagy. Marc-145 cells were infected with PRRSV CH-1a at 24 h.p.i. or were cultured with HBSS for 4 h as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1c, compared to the LC3II/LC3I ratio in the mock-infected cells, the ratio was increased in the infected Marc-145 cells. We explored whether PRRSV dsRNA and N proteins were associated with autophagosomes using confocal microscopy to identify whether the autophagosomes induced by PRRSV were related to viral replication or assembly.

Because PRRSV induced the formation of autophagosomes, we further explored which PRRSV NSPs played important roles in this process. Eukaryotic expression vectors carrying the Nsp cDNAs with an N-terminal mCherry tag were constructed and transfected into Marc-145 cells (Additional file 2: Figure S1). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the GFP-LC3 puncta accumulated in Nsp3-mCherry-, Nsp5-mCherry- and Nsp9-mCherry-transfected cells. NSP9 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that plays important roles in viral transcription and replication, and NSP3 and NSP5 are predicted to be transmembrane proteins; these proteins are anchored on the cytoplasmic membrane and are part of the membrane-bound replication and transcription complex. Furthermore, LC3 levels were detected using immunoblotting to determine the effects of the two transmembrane proteins on autophagy. p62/sequestosome-1 is a protein that can bind to LC3 as a scaffold protein or a signaling adapter and may be increased at the beginning of autophagy process and degraded gradually. Based on the data presented in Fig. 2c, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assay showed that the expression of the p62 protein was increased, indicating that NSP3 and NSP5 of PRRSV induced the formation of autophagosomes. As shown in Fig. 2d, a higher LC3II/LC3I ratio was observed in Nsp3-mCherry- and Nsp5-mCherry-transfected cells than in mock-infected cells. We identified some of the effects of these two transmembrane proteins on cell autophagy to determine whether the NSPs affected cytoplasmic membrane fusion.",

Therefore, endogenous ATG5 was confirmed at the site of immature autophagosomes. Autophagosome membranes have been shown to originate from the mitochondria [36] or ER [37]. Cells transfected with Nsp3-mCherry and Nsp5-mCherry were fixed and stained for ATG5 and calnexin, an ER marker. The value of overlap of the two different channels was calculated using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, and a value exceeding 0.5 was determined to indicate colocalization. As shown in Fig. 3a, ATG5 puncta were arranged in reticular structures and colocalized with calnexin in the cells expressing NSP3 and NSP5. Combined with the subsequent findings that PRRSV NSP3 and NSP5 were localized on the ER, these results suggested that the ATG5 puncta were derived from the ER. Little colocalization of the fluorescently labeled ATG5 proteins with MitoTracker Green, a mitochondrial marker, was observed in cells transfected with Nsp3-mCherry and Nsp5-mCherry (Fig. 3b).

Similarly, JEV NS3 targets IRGM to modulate autophagy [44], and CBV2 protein 2B, whose C-terminal sequence plays a decisive role in autophagy, rearranges the cell membrane [45]. In our study, GFP-LC3 puncta accumulated in Nsp3-mCherry-, Nsp5-mCherry- and Nsp9-mCherry-transfected cells and p62 expression was increased, indicating that NSP3, NSP5 and NSP9 induced the formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, we detected an increase in the ratio of LC3II to LC3I in cells transfected with Nsp3 and Nsp5, along with an increased expression of p62, confirming that NSP3 and NSP5 induce autophagy.",

            "text": "Generally, the process of autophagy includes two steps: the formation of autophagosomes and the degradation of autophagosomes. In the early stage of autophagy, ATG5 interacts with ATG12 and ATG16 to form the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex; this complex is localized in phagophores, which are the precursors of autophagosomes. In addition, the majority of autophagic degradation occurs when autophagosomes envelope cellular substances, which are delivered to the lysosomes for degradation of the contents. In the present study, a marker of phagosomes, which are the precursor of autophagosomes, namely, ATG5, was colocalized with calnexin, an ER marker, but not with MitoTracker, suggesting that the autophagosomes induced by NSP3 and NSP5 were derived from the ER but not from the mitochondria.",

PRRSV NSP3 and NSP5 were localized to the ER, but not the mitochondria, in the present study, suggesting that the two NSPs are transmembrane ER proteins but not transmembrane mitochondrial proteins. In a recent study, ER stress was activated in PRRSV-infected cells. Additionally, researchers previously believed that autophagy activation is accompanied by the activation of the ER stress pathway. The early ER stress response involves the splicing of the Xbp1 mRNA and the expression of CHOP. In the present study, we confirmed that the splicing of the Xbp1 mRNA was not noticeably altered and CHOP expression exhibited a slight increase, indicating that autophagy was not activated by ER stress in PRRSV Nsp3- and Nsp5-transfected cells. Because PRRSV NSP3 contains transmembrane domains and a hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain, we deleted the cytoplasmic domain and revealed that the activation of autophagy requires complete NSP3 protein.",
