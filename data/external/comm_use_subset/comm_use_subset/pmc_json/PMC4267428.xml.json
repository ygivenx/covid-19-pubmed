            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly lethal disease with nearly 100% mortality among ill cats once clinical signs appear, is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection [1]. Despite the ubiquitous existence of FCoV around the world, the prevalence of FIP is less than 5% [2]. There is currently no therapy proven to be effective for the treatment of FIP, and once diagnosis is confirmed, euthanasia is generally inevitable. Although this disease has been described for over fifty years [3], studies attempting to develop vaccines with different approaches have all failed due to the immunopathogenic features of infection by this virus [4]. However, among many FCoV experimental inoculations studies, some cats survived challenge with the virulent strain of FCoV [2,5-10], whereas certain pedigreed cats were reported to be more likely to succumb to FIP than mixed bred cats [2,11,12]. All these findings indicate that genetic polymorphisms between cats might affect their susceptibility to FIP.",

In addition to IFN-\u03b3, the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) during the development of FIP has been reported to result in lymphopenia [17]. Feline dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin (fDC-SIGN, encoded by fCD209), a key coreceptor during the infection of both type I and II FCoV [18], was found to affect binding and infection of type I FCoV. fDC-SIGN is also involved in the infection of type II FCoV, albeit not through the initial binding [19]. Despite the close relationship to FCoV infection, polymorphisms in the fCD209 and feline TNF-\u03b1 (fTNFA) genes and their association with FIP occurrence have never been investigated.",

Four SNPs were located in exons, including two SNPs in exon 6 at positions +1900 (TGG > TAG, W128*) and +1952 (AAC > AAA, N145K), one in exon 7 at position +2498 (ACG > ACT, T178T), and one in exon 8 at position +3070 (TTC > TCC, F241S). The remaining 21 SNPs were located in introns 6 and 7 (Figure 2). The mean allele frequencies of the minor alleles ranged from 0.6% to 47.6%.",

            "text": "During the development of FIP, the upregulation of TNF-\u03b1, an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been consistently found [4,17,24,25]. The overproduction of TNF-\u03b1 induces apoptosis in CD8+ T cells and is associated with the upregulation of a type II FCoV receptor, i.e., feline aminopeptidase N, which accelerates macrophage infection by the virus [26]. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 together with granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, and other neutrophil survival factors are suggested to prolong the survival of neutrophils, activate monocytes/macrophages, and contribute to the formation of the pyogranulomatous lesions of FIP [25]. In several human diseases, the most commonly identified genetic polymorphisms are located at position \u2212238 and \u2212308 of the promoter region of TNFA, suggesting an effect on the binding of transcription factors [27], with susceptibility for the development of several viral diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [28], dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) [29], and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [30]. Compared to the human gene (TNFA - 308), SNP located in a slightly upstream region of the feline gene (fTNFA - 421) was found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of FIP. The variant fTNFA - 421 T allele was significantly associated with resistance to FIP. Through DNA transcriptional factor binding site prediction, we found that an fTNFA - 421 C to T mutation might affect the binding of some transcription factors, such as myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) [31], a transcriptional regulator [32]. Through promoter binding, MZF1 was identified to function as a transcription activator of hematopoietic cells in vitro [32]. Because macrophages are hematopoietic cells, the loss of the binding site for such transcription factors might decrease TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages, which might prevent the immunopathogenesis and result in a resistant phenotype.",

            "text": "DC-SIGN, which recognizes high-mannose oligosaccharides as its ligand, is a co-receptor augmenting many viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus [33], dengue virus [34], HBV [35], and SARS-coronavirus [36]. In addition, feline DC-SIGN also serves as a co-receptor and is involved in infection by FCoV [19]. A human SNP in the promoter region of CD209 (\u2212336 A/G) was identified as related to disease prognosis [36]. A variant of CD209 - 336 was reported to affect the binding of SP1-like transcription factor and might modulate transcriptional activities [34], indicating that CD209 - 336 plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis. However, in our study, none of the SNPs in the promoter region showed an association with the outcome of FCoV infection. The identified FIP-associated SNPs, +1900 G/A, +2276 C/T, +2392 G/A, and +2713 C/T, were all located at the 3\u2032 end of fCD209. The polymorphism identified at fCD209 + 1900 is located in the lectin binding domain of the ECD; a G to A substitution leads to a change from a tryptophan at amino acid 128 to a stop codon. This mutation might lead to an abortive mRNA [37] or a truncated protein if the mRNA is successfully translated. DC-SIGN serves as a pattern recognition receptor that interact with numerous pathogens, including FCoV, and mediates the clustering of DC with naive T cells [38]. Additionally, with a type II transmembrane domain, the truncated fDC-SIGN identified in this study (+1900) might still be expressed on the cell surface. However, it remains to be elucidated how the truncated protein, bearing only one half of the authentic protein, affect the normal function of DC-SIGN, i.e., pathogen recognition or T cell activation. The other three FIP-associated SNPs were located in introns 6 and 7. Although these polymorphisms are located in introns, which apparently would not affect the protein, a regulatory effect cannot be excluded. In humans, the SNP at IFNG +874, located in intron 1, was found to alter the binding activity of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and influenced the production of IFN-\u03b3 [39]. In swine, an SNP (G3072A) in intron 3 of insulin-like growth factor 2 affected the binding of muscle growth regulator and was associated with the muscle content [40].",

As the susceptibility or resistance to viral infections is a complex phenotype regulated by multiple interacting genes and gene networks, genes related to innate and adaptive immunity and other host genes remain to be pursued. The combination of all the FIP susceptibility genotypes into a single typing diagnosis assay should facilitate the screening of FIP-resistant cats in breeding and eventually decrease the loss of cats to this incurable disease.",
