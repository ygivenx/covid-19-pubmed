Recent studies have advised that dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) serve as a reservoir host for MERS-CoV, and camel-to-human transmission can occur through sporadic zoonotic infections associated with exposure to infected dromedary camels and their products [3,4,5]. The risk factors were identified for primary MERS-CoV infection in persons with either direct or indirect exposure to camels. In particular, these included persons who handle live camels (e.g., camel workers, camel salesmen, camel shepherds, slaughterhouse workers, animal and waste transporters) and persons who administer medications to camels or clean camel medical equipment [6,7,8]. Nevertheless, most patients report no exposure to camels [9]. The global camel population is estimated at approximately 35 million camels [10]; of these, 95% are dromedary camels [11]. In Saudi Arabia, the camel is considered a national, socio-cultural heritage animal and is central in the livestock economy, as it is used for milk or meat and in a traditional race festival (locally known as Mazain al-Ibal) [12]. The number of camels in Saudi Arabia is estimated at more than 1.39 million heads [13] and has been growing annually by 5.2% since 1961 [10]. Information is lacking regarding the distribution of camels in Saudi Arabia. In June 2019, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture launched an electronic system for numbering and tracking camels in order to create a database on them through the use of microchip implants [14]. This endeavor is a part of a wider initiative to control animal diseases and to create a database on each camel and its owner. The new project will help improve camel health and control the spread of zoonotic diseases.",

However, nosocomial transmission in healthcare facilities between patients and healthcare workers and between patients sharing spaces in healthcare facilities represents the main mode of human-to-human infection [16]. MERS-CoV outbreaks linked to healthcare settings have occurred in several countries, with the largest being in Saudi Arabia, especially in 2014 and 2015 [17,18,19]. This may be due to inadequate, inconsistent or incomplete compliance with infection prevention and control practices, limited isolation of suspected MERS-CoV patients and patient crowdedness [20]. Furthermore, household transmission was observed from patients to other household members, but this was less striking than other modes of transmission [15,17,18,21]. In Saudi Arabia, the probable risk factors for MERS-CoV infection were older age [20,22], male sex [22], exposure to dromedary camels, comorbidities and smoking [23]. For household transmission, the identified risk factors were sleeping in an index patient\u2019s room, removing a patient\u2019s waste or touching respiratory secretions [21]. The factors related to MERS-CoV mortality were mainly old age and the existence of underlying comorbidities [22,24].",

            "text": "The spread of an infectious disease is an instance of spatiotemporal diffusion processes at work, in which the emergence of the disease moves across space and changes in extent over time [25]. Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26,27]. Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28]. However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. However, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. A geo-additive regression model was also utilized to examine the risk factor levels of individuals for MERS-CoV mortality in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2015 [30], and significant spatial variation and clustering with a lower risk were found in Riyadh, Arar, Aljouf and Jizan, whereas a higher risk was observed in Qassim province. However, the spatial analysis lacked detail at the governorate and city levels. The application of an iterative empirical process in a GIS environment revealed that high-camel-density areas, camel convergence points (camel markets, barns, breeding sites and slaughterhouses), former MERS-CoV cases and high seroprevalence rates were the potential risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots in Kenya [31]. Considering the space and time dimensions of the MERS-CoV, one study highlighted that higher heterogeneity was more prominent in zoonotic than in human-to-human transmission in the Middle East region; this result emphasizes the importance of the environmental component of the epidemic [32].",

Indirect contact includes casual contact with sites where camels have been (e.g., camel markets or farms) but without direct physical contact with camels, or living with a household member who has had direct contact with camels. By contrast, a secondary case is defined as a person who has shared the same enclosed space (e.g., a room or office) for frequent or extended periods with an individual with a symptomatic MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV is believed to spread between humans mainly through contact and respiratory droplets. However, transmission through small particle droplet nuclei (aerosols) may occur.

The purely spatial scan statistic is defined by a circular window on the map. The window is sequentially centered on each of several possible cities that are positioned throughout the study area. The spatiotemporal scan statistic imposes a cylindrical window with a circular geographic base and height corresponding to time. The temporal scan statistic uses a window that moves in one dimension, time, defined in the same way as the height of the cylinder used by the spatiotemporal scan statistic. The key feature that distinguishes the seasonal scan statistic from the purely temporal scan statistic is that the former ignores the year of the observation and retains only the day and month [40]. The number of MERS-CoV cases by city was used as the case file, the city population estimated from the 2010 census [38] was used as the population file and the latitude and longitude of each city were used in the coordinates file.",

The null hypothesis is that the incidence of MERS-CoV is randomly distributed, and the alternative hypothesis is that the incidence increases more inside the window than in areas outside it. The log likelihood ratio (LLR) is the hypothesis-testing statistic estimated based on Monte Carlo randomization. The window with the maximum likelihood ratio is the most likely cluster; that is, it identifies the cluster that is least likely to occur by chance. In addition to the most likely cluster, SaTScan also designates secondary clusters for purely spatial and spatiotemporal analyses and ranks them in relation to their estimated LLR statistic. SaTScan scans for clusters by using different criteria; the criterion recommended by SaTScan is the percentage of the population at risk, with a value of 50% [40]. We tested the percentage of the population at risk from 10% to 50%, and from the result, 30% performed best; that is, the value of 30% did not include neighboring cities that have a non-elevated risk. The four types of analyses (purely temporal, seasonal, purely spatial and spatiotemporal) were conducted using the Poisson discrete-based model with 999 Monte Carlo permutations to test for statistical significance. Only clusters with significance levels of 0.05 and only scans of cities with high rates were reported. For temporal analysis, values of 1 day, 1 month and 1 year were set as the time aggregation units for the daily, monthly and annual clusters, respectively, whereas for the seasonal cluster, 1 month was set. For spatiotemporal analysis, 1 month and 1 year were set for the monthly and annual spatiotemporal analyses, respectively.",

To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study that aims to analyze the spatiotemporal pattern and clustering of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. A total of 2008 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported in Saudi Arabia, representing approximately 83% of the global cases. Overall, the majority of MERS-CoV cases were secondary infections (40.90%). This result indicates that secondary infections, either hospital or community acquired, remain a major challenge for the Saudi healthcare system in the prevention and control of MERS-CoV outbreaks, despite the significant improvement in MERS-CoV surveillance. On the other hand, the primary cases accounted for only 24.05% of the total confirmed cases. Although compared with the general population, people in close contact with dromedary camels have a higher risk of developing MERS-CoV infection via a primary source [3,4,5], our results indicated that only 48.24% of the total primarily infected cases were associated with direct or indirect contact with camels. This result is consistent with previous findings [4] regarding the ambiguity of primary MERS-CoV infection transmission. In Saudi Arabia, camel milk and meat production has increased by 5.4% and 6.4% per year, respectively [41]. However, intensified animal production has epidemiological consequences, including increased risk of disease. Recent trends in Saudi Arabia have indicated a tendency towards dromedary camel husbandry intensification since the 1960s, as evident in increased production in nearby cities by providing enhanced supplemental diets for the animals and improving camel health management [11,42,43]. These areas of intensified camel production are probable hotspots for the transmission and spread of MERS-CoV. In addition, dealing with camel products, consuming raw unpasteurized milk and conducting slaughter processes have been documented as risk factors for primary MERS-CoV transmission to humans [44].",

A combination of sporadic and epidemic patterns as a result of animal-to-human, human-to-human and unknown exposure was observed. By contrast, the epidemic curve in South Korea, where the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula occurred, had a clear nosocomial epidemiological pattern [45]. Purely temporal cluster analyses of MERS-CoV infection illustrated significant clusters in April and May of 2014. This finding is consistent with previous results [46], which showed significant peaks in MERS-CoV incidence between March and May during a similar period. Seasonal cluster analysis identified April and May as a strongly significant seasonal cluster of MERS-CoV infection. In accordance with our findings, it was reported in [47] that MERS-CoV infection occurred markedly in June, followed by May and April, and the lowest rates were seen in January. One possible reason for this trend is the seasonal variations in zoonotic infections in camels during the breeding season [48,49], when camel farms are considered an important potential source of MERS-CoV transmission [47]. Moreover, a recent serological study in Saudi Arabia found a higher risk of MERS-CoV infection in camels in winter than in summer [50]. However, the low daily frequency and sporadic cases of MERS-CoV indicate a reduced likelihood of zoonotic-to-human transmission and increased possibility of human-to-human transmission, which is consistent with other findings [51]. The main MERS-CoV outbreaks in 2014 and 2015 were closely followed by human influenza A epidemics [52]. No coincidence was found between the peak of influenza occurrence and MERS-CoV occurrence, which suggests that the seasonal characteristics of MERS-CoV infections may vary from those of human influenza viral infections. In this study, no epidemics of MERS-CoV were observed during mass gatherings of pilgrims in the Hajj season, which is consistent with previous findings [53]. This indicates another knowledge gap regarding the mode of transmission that needs further investigation.",

The probable source of infection in the majority of the cases in this outbreak was secondary human-to-human transmission in Jeddah that took place in healthcare facilities as a result of overcrowding and inadequate infection control measures, rather than a sudden increase in primary cases in the community [49]. The spatiotemporal cluster detected in Riyadh between March 2014 and October 2015 could be attributed to several outbreaks, with the most prominent one occurring in a single healthcare setting in Riyadh in August 2015 [54]. In addition, the most recent clusters of MERS-CoV incidence were identified in Wadi Addawasir in February 2019, in Dumat Aljundal in August 2017 and in Buraydah in March 2016; according to [55,56,57], the majority of the cases were associated with healthcare-acquired infections.
