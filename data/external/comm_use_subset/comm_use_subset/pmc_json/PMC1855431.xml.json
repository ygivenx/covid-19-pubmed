            "text": "Emerging infections with nonspecific symptoms have enormous impact on public health and global economics (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks, and avian (H5N1) influenza). Such outbreaks emphasize the need for efficient simultaneous detection of multiple organisms that will facilitate timely and judicious implementation of countermeasures for outbreak containment, treatment interventions, and case management [1]. Ideally, a system capable of detecting all potentially relevant organisms is needed. There are many technologies being developed with a view toward addressing this issue, for example MasscodeTM multiplex RT-PCR system [2], electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of PCR amplicons [3], Luminex\u00ae xMAP\u2122 [4], and other microarray based approaches [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. While promising, these technologies have only been tested for detection of a few pathogens or particular classes of pathogens simultaneously. In addition, these technologies provide a very limited range of genetic resolution and require additional testing for determination of detailed mutation or strain-variations in detected pathogens. High density resequencing arrays provide resolution of individual nucleotides in long target sequences (hundreds to thousands of nucleotides) [12], [13]. We have demonstrated discrimination of mutations in targeted pathogens as well as sensitivities and specificities that are similar to or improved over those of other technologies based on a subset of the organisms the microarray is designed to detect. The respiratory pathogen microarray version 1 (RPM v.1), while not providing comprehensive coverage of all potential causes of respiratory illness, targets a much broader range of organisms (including bacteria and DNA and RNA viruses) in a single test than other potential methods [14], [15], [16], [17].",

We have also demonstrated the use of culture isolates of clinical samples in which a more detailed analysis of strain distribution in influenza viruses was possible [17]. Unfortunately, when directly using clinical samples, only the successful attribution of flu samples to the correct flu season was accomplished [15]. The accuracy of the base calls from the array has been compared with only de novo sequencing using culture isolates of clinical samples. Our studies demonstrate that one of the challenges in developing multiplex detection systems for a broad range of very different organisms is the validation of the test results. Few samples are available that have been subjected to testing for a large number of diverse pathogens. Similarly, the archived clinical specimens used in our previous studies were originally only tested for a few select targets. When multiple organisms were detected by the RPM v.1, it was not always possible to perform confirmatory testing due to a lack of available materials. This is a limitation of using archived samples for validating newly developed multiplex assays as it is very time-consuming and costly thus making multiple confirmatory assays in clinical specimens very difficult to achieve.",

A set of 424 clinical samples collected in the Washington, DC metropolitan region from December 2004 to February 2005 were subjected to a full panel of conventional microbial analysis (culture and/or RT-PCR/PCR) as well as analysis by the RPM v.1 microarray. This set of samples demonstrated good agreement across the panel of tests making authentication of multiple detection events by the RPM v.1 microarray possible. Many specimens from this set represented co-infections providing a range of multi-target samples for analysis. Here we use clinical samples rather than culture isolates and demonstrate detailed analysis of strain distributions of influenza viruses within a flu season as well as providing a phylogenetic measure of circulating influenza strains. The accuracy of the base calls was confirmed by comparison to de novo sequencing using representative clinical samples. This comparison of a broad-spectrum viral and bacterial identification technology with a large battery of conventional \u201cgold standard\u201d assays represents more rigorous testing of our approach for both medical surveillance and investigation of complex etiologies than has been carried out previously. This study provides a previously unavailable fundamental assessment of a multiple pathogen detection assay and paves the way to improvements for a microarray-based platform which would provide more comprehensive multiple pathogen detection in a single test. The implications and limitations of the assay are also discussed.",

This is because a measure of uncertainty is introduced in the quality of the reference assays as the services of a local reference laboratory could not be arranged (samples were transported to San Diego, CA). Furthermore, although large sample volumes are set aside for reference assays, a reduction in detection sensitivity is still inevitable because these samples are split and frozen before testing for each viral and bacterial agent in separate cultures. To reduce this uncertainty, archived samples stored at the time of the original testing are retested using real-time RT-PCR/PCR in house as an additional reference method on RPM-positive but culture-negative samples, using positive (positive for both RPM and culture) and negative controls (negative for both RPM and culture). Combining the results of all confirmatory tests demonstrates an excellent concordance with RPM v.1 (Table 2 and Table S2\u2013S3) with \u226598% overall agreement for all the organisms detected. The false positive/negative rate is within a reasonable range expected when testing any two methods such as is seen when PCR assay methods are compared to culture methods for all but two of the organisms. The detection sensitivity for Coronaviruses and S. pneumoniae by RPM v.1 is lower compared to the PCR methods and indicates the need to improve and/or optimize the primers sets used in the RPM v.1 assay for these organisms.

Broad-spectrum diagnostics are particularly useful when different etiological agents that cause similar symptoms (such as respiratory illness) co-circulate in the same populations, or when co-infections of multiple organisms are of potential importance to epidemiology, symptomology, or treatment. However, it is difficult, cumbersome and costly to detect multiple pathogens and co-infections using culture methods or single test PCR methods. Currently, the reported coinfection rate among respiratory pathogens varies (4.5\u201323%) due to the different breadth and sensitivities of the detection methods [23]. Using RPM v.1 (and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR/PCR), this study found that 58 (13.7%) of the tested samples showed viral or viral/bacterial co-infections (Table 4). It is a challenge that will only increase in difficulty as more organisms are covered to establish the validity of any broad spectrum platform against \u201cgold\u201d standards as few existing archive samples have been tested for such a large number of organisms.",

This study shows that the majority of the clinical samples tested are positive for influenza A/B virus (74%), which is not surprising for the samples collected during the flu season. Comparison of conventional sequencing for representative influenza A positive samples demonstrates the utility of this information from RPM v.1. The isolates belong to two major lineages of influenza A/H3N2 and all isolates are evolved from the A/Fujian/411/02 strain, one component of the influenza vaccine for 2004\u20132005 season. Antigenic drift selected by vaccination apparently leads to new strains of influenza A/H3N2 during 2004\u20132005. As anticipated, the RPM v.1 identifies the A/California/7/2004 lineage as the dominant circulating strain. The interesting feature is the emergence of Wellington lineage strains at the same time in significant numbers, which are of the same clade as the A/Wisconsin/67/2005 strain, a suggested vaccine component for 2006\u20132007 season. These results confirm that the RPM v.1 is a useful tool itself not only for influenza surveillance but also for predicting antigenic variation that will be beneficial for vaccine candidate predication. Considering all of these results, a high level of confidence in the general reliability of the resequencing approach for simultaneous pathogen detection and strain/variant identification directly from clinical samples has been established.",

Consequently, no pathogen is detected for 14% of the specimens, but the patients still exhibit flu-like symptoms. Furthermore, the RPM v.1 is designed as a proof-of-concept microarray for the detection of more than 20 common respiratory pathogens encountered among military basic trainees with large section of the chip dedicated to adenoviruses and influenza viruses, but in this work it is used for surveying a slightly different population within Washington, D.C. metropolitan region, which have a broad age, gender, and geographic distribution and may have a different mix of common pathogens. In addition, the major causes of the common cold, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, are under represented on the RPM v.1. Subsequently, only a few strains of the recognized 99 strains of rhinovirus and none of the enteroviruses can be detected by RPM v.1. The confirmatory assays do identify several organisms (i.e. PIV2, H. influenzae) in clinical specimens that the RPM v.1 is not designed to detect. Additionally, preliminary testing of a new chip design with more thorough coverage (>75 pathogens) identifies pathogens that the confirmatory assays detect but which the RPM v.1 cannot detect (unpublished data). This indicates the potential of this technology to reduce the number of samples not attributed to a tested organism to a significantly smaller number than is currently possible.",

            "text": "The major difficulties of the current technology are associated with the primer selection for amplification of the chosen targets. The design of the multiplex amplification strategy is a time consuming effort. The current system remains somewhat vulnerable to the rapid mutation of RNA viruses and each new resequencing array design that increases the number of pathogens would require recalibrating the multiplex primers mix. One solution that already mitigates this is the grouping of pathogens into subsets for amplifications that are recombined for chip analysis. In the future, the more variable pathogens can be partitioned into their own mix so that the performance for the conserved pathogens i.e. bacteria are not affected when primers are changed and only mixes that have targets added to them require recalibration. Simplified redesign and alternative amplification methods that provide the necessary sensitivity with more comprehensive coverage are also currently being investigated. Despite these limitations, the positive results of this study lead us to believe the resequencing microarray is an excellent candidate for the next generation pathogen detection tools and provide a modern, broad-spectrum infectious disease surveillance solution for critical decision makers, including healthcare providers, patients, public health authorities, and framers of biosecurity policy.",
