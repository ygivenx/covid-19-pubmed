Thoracic measurements (Fig. 1\u20132) were performed with DXRay Diagnost software which is included in the digital radiography system (PLX8200, Nanjing Perlove Medical Equipment Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China), the software allowed us to view the digital radiographs on the computer and measure the radiographs by built-in tools. After taking and conserving the films, we can measure them accurately by the software. The lung length (LL) was defined as the distance from the tubercle of the first rib to the top of the dome of the right diaphragm [12]. The maximal interior thoracic depth (TD), obtained from lateral films, was defined as the distance between the ventral surface of the vertebral body and the posterior sternum at the level of the top of the right diaphragm. The maximal interior thoracic breadth (TBr) was defined as the linear distance between the internal margins of the ribs near the superior margin of the hemidiaphragm [9]. The cardiac silhouette breadth (CBr) was defined as the sum of the distance from the midline to the right border of the cardiac silhouette plus the distance from the midline to the left border of the cardiac silhouette [9]. The cardiothoracic ratio (CR) was defined as CBr divided by TBr [9]. The bilateral costophrenic angles (CA), consisting of the right costophrenic angle (RCA) and the left costophrenic angle (LCA), was defined from the right and left sides where the diaphragm meets the ribs [13]. The right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) was obtained from lateral radiography by drawing a line parallel to the thoracic spine from the highest point of the pulmonary apex to the diaphragm; this did not always end at the highest point on the diaphragm. An intersecting line then was drawn from the midpoint of the hilus pulmonis perpendicular to the first line. R-HHR was defined as the ratio of the distance from the pulmonary apex to the hilus pulmonis (T1) to the distance from the hilus pulmonis to the diaphragm (T2) [14].",

Though more advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have emerged, projectional X-ray (\u201cplain film\u201d) radiography remains the most rapid, cost-effective imaging modality for non-human primates used at monkey bases and laboratories globally.

Here, LL, TD, and TBr all increased with age; interestingly, similar age-related differences in thoracic parameters have also been reported in rhesus macaques [5].

On account of the higher sexual dimorphic growth rate in male relative to female cynomolgus macaques with advancing age, LL, TD, and TBr were significantly higher in males than in females in the 49\u201360 month age group [17], [18].",

            "text": "In human studies, the cardiothoracic ratio (CR) is a well-established measurement of cardiac size and provides prognostic information on congenital cardiac defects and acquired heart disease [19], [20]. Non-human primates display similar heart diseases to humans [1], [7], and there have been five studies reporting CRs in non-human primates [4], [5], [7], [8], [9]. With regard to these studies, the mean CR of captive cynomolgus monkey found here was most similar to that of the Macaca tonkeana (mean CR = 0.599) [9] and the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) [5] (mean CR = 0.59), but slightly higher than that of the Macaca cyclopis (mean CR = 0.528) [7], Macaca nigra (mean CR = 0.522) [9], and feral cynomolgus monkeys from Indonesia (mean CR = 0.550) [8]. There are two hypotheses regarding these differences. First, inter-species variability or differences in origin between the same species may have contributed to these differences. Second, the differences in age structure among the study groups may have lead to these differences. Moreover, in contrast to the aforementioned studies [5], [7], [8], [9], our study found that CRs declined with age. This pattern of age-related changes suggests that the cardiac growth rate is slower than the TBr. In addition, the relationship between CR and CBr (CR x TBr) and body weight was analyzed. The CR did not significantly correlate with the body weight of either males (r = 0.021, p = 0.683) or females (r = 0.055, p = 0.337). Similarly, Schillaci et al. has reported no significant relationship between CR and body weight in adult feral cynomolgus monkeys and pet macaques from Indonesia [8], [9]. In contrast, the CBr did significantly correlate with the body weight of males (r = 0.611, p<0.01, n = 391) and females (r = 0.321, p<0.01, n = 306). We speculate that the significant CBr-body weight correlation (and the lack of a significant CR-body weight correlation) is related to pubertal skeletal growth, as this phenomenon would affect CBr but not CR.",

We found that the R-HHR values were relatively constant across all three age groups (range: 1.00\u20131.84), which is consistent with human studies reporting normal R-HHR values exceeding 1.00 [14]. Compared with our previous findings in rhesus monkeys [5], R-HHR values were slightly lower in cynomolgus monkeys as compared to rhesus monkeys on an age group basis, which may be attributed to inter-species variation. We also observed that R-HHR values were higher in males than in females, but no explanation is available for this sex-based variation.",

The angulation of bilateral costophrenic angles are typically sharp under normal conditions and typically blunted in diseased states. Here, the bilateral costophrenic angles were clear and sharp and varied in size from 22 to 54 degrees, which is similar to previous observations in rhesus monkeys [4] and capuchin monkeys [13]. There were no sex- nor age-associated differences observed with respect to bilateral costophrenic angles.",
