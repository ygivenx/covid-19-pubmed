            "text": "When a novel infectious disease emerges, it is vital to assess the potential global public health impact, i.e. the potential of a pathogen to cause a devastating pandemic [1]. The public health impact is mainly characterized by the transmission potential and virulence, the latter of which is usually measured by the case fatality ratio (CFR), namely the proportion of deaths among cases [2]. Due to the importance of generating accurate estimates of the CFR in real time as an outbreak progresses and public health interventions are implemented, a number of epidemiological methods have been proposed, including those that account for the time delay from illness onset to death [3\u20135] and those that correct for ascertainment bias through the combination of several different observations by employing a Bayesian evidence synthesis method [6]. Other methods have developed a slightly different CFR concept, e.g. the so-called \u201cinfection fatality risk\u201d, the ratio of excess mortality to the serologically determined infected fraction of the population [7]. The CFR is an important epidemiological quantity to estimate in real time during outbreaks, and the recent outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea in 2015 has not been an exception [8]. Besides the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea, earlier studies of MERS in the Middle East have consistently indicated that the CFR for MERS has been about 40 % [9] and could be as low as 20 % for estimates that only include secondary cases [10].",

            "text": "Despite the availability of useful methods to estimate the CFR for MERS, it is crucial to identify risk factors associated with MERS death, as the risk of death may vary significantly with age, occupation, and underlying comorbidities [11]. During the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a real-time analysis found that confirmed or probable cases aged 60 years or older were at greater risk of death than younger cases [12]. Moreover, infections with SARS-associated coronavirus with comorbidities were found to be 1.7 times more likely to die than those without comorbidities [13]. Due to similarities in clinical characteristics between MERS and SARS patients as both coronaviruses are closely related [9], we can expect that the risk of MERS death can also be similarly characterized by a set of underlying epidemiological features of the cases. While the methods for identifying the risk of death in real time during the SARS epidemic have relied on survival analysis techniques, including non-parametric Kaplan-Meier-like methods [12, 14], there is a need to develop a simple yet tractable method which is inspired on the adjustment of censoring for CFR [4, 5] with particular application to small outbreak sizes such as the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea. Such a modelling framework should adjust for case ascertainment, which is widely recognized as a key issue that arises during emerging disease epidemics, including the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 [2, 7, 8]. During the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea, an extensive contact tracing effort was made by public health authorities soon after the first few cases were reported, with all cases being confirmed by laboratory testing irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. As in any outbreak, it is likely that the ascertainment rate was substantially improved as the outbreak progressed.",

As of July 31, 2015, a total of 185 cases have been diagnosed (excluding one case diagnosed and recovered in China) including 36 deceased cases. During the course of this outbreak, a detailed line list of cases has been made publicly available [15]. Data on individual cases include the (1) dates of illness onset, (2) age-group, (3) gender, and (4) background health status either as outpatient or inpatient of a specific healthcare facility. Since the dates of illness onset among those recently reported were not yet available, we relied on the dates of confirmatory diagnosis as an alternative. We believe it is reasonable to approximate the date of illness onset by the date of confirmed diagnosis in this setting, because from the midst of the outbreak, all suspected contacts have been regularly monitored and have been subjected to laboratory testing regardless of clinical signs and symptoms. We limited ourselves to handle the abovementioned covariates (2) to (4) only, not each specific individual comorbidity, because it is not clear if the presence of all common underlying comorbidities were routinely evaluated and consistently documented in the case list; the identification of most closely associated specific comorbidities may be the subject of future clinical studies.",

Our CFR estimate for senior persons was consistent with an overall CFR estimate of 40 % from prior studies [9]. Moreover, it can also explain a decline in the CFR estimate among secondary cases in the Middle East at 20 % [10, 19]: most secondary transmissions were among healthcare workers and visitors without underlying comorbidities. Because MERS outbreaks tend to be amplified in healthcare settings comprised by a significant fraction of vulnerable populations (e.g. older populations with underlying comorbidities), an important caveat derived from our analysis is that it is critical to enhance and maintain infection control measures in healthcare settings not only to avoid secondary transmissions but also mitigate the mortality burden. Countermeasures that minimize infections among patients in healthcare settings, e.g. restricting the number of visits to different hospitals per case, should be taken into consideration.",

Specifically, prior studies on SARS have employed non-parametric survival analysis during the course of the epidemic [3, 12] and a method for estimating relative case fatality was proposed elsewhere [20]. However, compared to earlier models, the proposed model was shown to be advantageous in two aspects. First, our approach allowed us to pinpoint a sharp decline in the CFR over time by using only a single multiplicative parameter. Indeed, the reason behind a decline in CFR by 70 % since June 6, 2015, is consistent with an increased case ascertainment due to extensive contact tracing efforts during the outbreak which has inherently increased the diagnosis of very mild cases. If we aim to estimate the risk of death among all infected individuals [7], the corresponding estimate is likely lower than what we presented here. Second, as we employed the logistic type model, our method is able to handle very small sample sizes for each subgroup of cases. By using the logit model, our approach was able to successfully identify risk factors from very small samples (i.e. 185 cases and 36 deaths) for the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea.",

Second, we had to reach a compromise with some data gaps. In particular, whenever the date of illness onset was unavailable, the date of confirmatory diagnosis was used as a proxy. However, considering that Korean public health investigators have successfully conducted major contact tracing efforts and tested all suspected cases, the difference between these two time variables appeared to have been small (e.g. among cases who developed illness in the latter half of June 2015, the median time elapsed from illness onset to diagnosis was only 2 days). The same issue applies to the interpretation of the date of death. In contrast to the substantial differences between the actual and reported date of death for cases of the Ebola virus disease outbreaks in West Africa, the close monitoring of MERS cases in South Korea enabled us to analyze the actual date of death in real time.",
