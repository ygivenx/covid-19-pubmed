Infections and inflammation have also been linked to the development of other diseases: autoimmune diseases, cancer, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression2\u20136. Inter-individual differences influence the susceptibility to infection, which is likely to depend on environmental and social factors, vulnerable periods, such as psychological stress or immunocompromised conditions, and the host\u2019s genetic profile7,8. Twin and adoption studies as well as epidemiological studies have indicated that hosts\u2019 genetic makeups influence infectious disease occurrences and outcomes of interactions between infectious pathogens and hosts7\u201310. However, the genetic architecture of susceptibility to infection is largely unknown, and knowledge of the genetic composition of infections may help elucidate the mechanism of human complex diseases8,11.",

Only a few large-scale studies of the genetics of susceptibility to infection have been conducted, with the largest study being on self-reported common infections and infection-associated procedures11. A recent meta-analysis of pooled respiratory infection GWAS (including studies on tuberculosis, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-Coronavirus and pneumonia) found only one significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), in the IL4 gene7. Previous studies have often provided conflicting results and been hampered by low power, differences in study designs, and/or high risk of publication bias7. Recently, acknowledging the potential links between psychiatric disorders and infection, studies looking into the genetic of specific infections have been performed, including a study of infection (Toxoplasma gondii, Herpes simplex virus 1, Cytomegalovirus and Human herpesvirus 6) and inflammation in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder13, and a study of Toxoplasma gondii in individuals with schizophrenia14 highlighted several genes and/or pathways.",

A minority of these individuals (N = 1993) have been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders (other codes in F00\u2212F99) and originally included as part of the random population sample. Individual-based data were available until emigration, death, or 31 December 2012 of a given individual. Three subsets were used across the analyses in this study: only the individuals without psychiatric diagnosis (no F00\u2212F99 diagnosis), only the individuals with psychiatric diagnosis (primary or secondary iPSYCH diagnosis of F00\u2212F99), or a combined sample with a covariate for having a psychiatric diagnosis. More details are given in the relevant sections. With regards to the infection diagnoses, Supplementary Table S1 includes sample sizes for all infection categories. All hospital contacts for infections (both in- and outpatient hospital contacts) were included with ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes listed in Supplementary Table S2, as used in previous studies4,22,23, and each person may have a history of more than one infection. We omitted all diagnoses listed as \u201csuspected\u201d or \u201cnot found\u201d. Controls for infections were defined as having none of the infection diagnoses in Table S1, and controls for psychiatric disorders were defined as not having any ICD-10 diagnosis of F00\u2212F99 in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, unless stated otherwise.",

A full description of the procedure of the sample and SNP QC is provided elsewhere24. Briefly, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the iPSYCH sample with 1000 Genomes Project samples as a reference panel to compute the initial principal component space. Individuals whose parents and grandparents were born in Denmark were used as a reference in removing individuals who were a certain distance from the multivariate mean of the joint distribution of the first ten PCs. This was then repeated using only the iPSYCH sample to identify subtler within-population differences. Samples were also removed based on genotype missingness, abnormal heterozygosity or ambiguous sex, based on genetic markers. Samples that were identified as duplicates were also removed. Lastly, samples that were found to be related to other samples (first and second degree) were removed, whereby the cases and then samples with a higher genotype call rate were prioritized. Following this, a new PCA was performed to obtain principal components for downstream analyses. For the imputation, only autosomal SNPs were used, and SNPs were removed based on low minor allele frequency (<0.01), Hardy\u2212Weinberg equilibrium P value (<10\u22126), having more than two alleles, or being indels. Genotypes were phased with SHAPEIT325 and imputed with IMPUTE226. Imputed markers were removed if they had an INFO score below 0.2, a MAF below 0.001, best-guess genotypes missing in >10% of subjects, HWE P < 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 (in controls) or a highest probability for a genotype of less than 0.9. Markers were also removed if they were significantly associated with the genotyping wave. Two marker datasets were used: in the GWAS, all post-QC dosage data were used. This dataset included 11,600,722 markers. For the heritability, genetic correlation and PRS analyses, which are based on an aggregation of SNPs, the above dataset was filtered, resulting in a dataset of high-confidence imputations (best-guess genotypes), with markers having an INFO score of at least 0.8 and MAF of at least 0.01. This dataset included 7,071,055 markers. Positions throughout this paper are in hg19.",

Given that we observe psychiatric patients have a higher incidence of infections, the two variables are not independent23. Also, the direction of causality is unknown. To avoid creating PRS that could misrepresent the genetic effects on infection risk (i.e., predicts psychiatric outcomes, which, in turn, predict infection as an environmental exposure) we develop our PRS for infections from a GWAS of infections in patients without psychiatric outcomes (N = 19,645). We used the summary statistics from this GWAS as the training dataset, and the subset of psychiatric cases as the target sample (N = 45,889). As the PRS was trained in a nonpsychiatric population, any PRS\u2212infection correlations are not likely to be mediated by the current expression of psychiatric outcomes. Furthermore, any confounding between psychiatric diagnoses and infection within the psychiatric population should be independent of the infection PRS by construction and should only contribute to residual variation. In this context, our target sample (the psychiatric cases) will have slightly less power to detect a reduced effect of the PRS relative to a healthy population sample, but the confound should not increase false positives. We used an r2 threshold of 0.1 in a window of 250 kbp for clumping. As both the training sample and target sample used the same SNP dataset, there was a full overlap between both samples in terms of marker data availability. We ran PRSice with P value thresholds of 0.01\u22121 with intervals of 0.01, and the regression included covariates for age, age-squared, sex and the first ten PCs.

All P values were <0.05, and all apart from the association with anorexia remained significant after Bonferroni correction.

To transform the observed heritabilities to liability-scale heritabilities39, we adjusted for the proportion of infection cases in the different groups as well as for different values of the lifetime prevalence, k (the iPSYCH individuals are too young to estimate the true value of k), which allowed us to provide the maximal bound for the heritabilities, given the proportions of cases in our sample. The maximal values of the heritability on the liability scale are around 7% in psychiatric controls, 5.5% in psychiatric cases and 5% in the combined sample (Fig. 2), suggesting a modest genetic component for susceptibility to infection.

Additionally, we confirmed the genetic correlation using LD score regression, which is robust to sample overlap. The rg obtained from this analysis was 0.407 (P = 9.1 \u00d7 10\u22125, SE = 0.104). It is lower than the estimate obtained with GCTA (the latter being potentially biased by the sample overlap), but it is still quite large and significant.",

We identified 891 SLIT2 mutation carriers, of whom 426 had at least one infection diagnosis (47.8%). 17,928 individuals did not carry a mutation in SLIT2, and 8214 of those had at least one infection diagnosis (45.8%).

In the same vein, it is also possible that the genetic factors that manifest susceptibility to infection in later stages of life were not captured here. As our dataset included diagnoses of only psychiatric/neurological conditions, infections, and autoimmune diseases (which are correlated with psychiatric conditions)50, we did not have an appropriate third category of diseases within which we could examine the incidence of infections. Furthermore, we could include only individuals with hospital contact for infection; hence, the less severe cases of infections were not included. However, this could also be advantageous, as the investigated phenotypes have been so severe as to require a hospital contact, meaning that they may represent a more defined group. Nonetheless, the potential impact of misclassification in the individuals not recorded with infections could result in the genetic associations in our study representing the severity of infection rather than susceptibility to infection. It should also be noted that our models do not incorporate the temporal component of the association between infections and psychiatric disorders; as our phenotypes were complex, and as they may represent more than one infection and/or psychiatric disorder diagnosed in a given individual, our study does not answer questions pertaining to the directionality of this association. Moreover, the genetic contribution might have been greater if studying individuals with severe infections, where genetic susceptibility to infection might play a larger role. Even though this is the largest GWAS to date on infections requiring hospital contact, the included heterogeneous groups of infections might warrant an even larger sample to display the underlying genetic architecture of the susceptibility to infection using GWAS. Lastly, while using a large sample from a homogenous population is advantageous in that it eliminates certain confounders, especially in terms of genetic variation, the results could prove to be specific to the Danish population, as genetic associations across populations can differ based on the presence of the variant in one population but not others, difference in allele frequencies when it is present in more than one population, as well as differences in disease prevalence and variant effect sizes across populations51.",
