Furthermore, N protein plays an important role in PEDV RNA synthesis and enhancing the PEDV transcription and virion assembly [8,9,10]. However, the effects of N protein on PEDV infection usually depend on its interaction with some host factors. For example, PEDV N protein binds with phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM1) and then protects it from proteolytic degradation by caspase-3, enhancing cell survival and PEDV growth [11]. In addition, it has been proved that interaction between PEDV N protein and TBK1 could inhibit IRF3 activation and type I IFN production, further to causing the circumvention of the host\u2019s antiviral immunity [12].",

HnRNP A1 is a RNA-binding protein which functions as binding to pre-mRNA to form hnRNP particles in eukaryotic cells [15]. This protein contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and a glycine-rich domain responsible for protein-protein interaction [16,17]. It has been reported that hnRNP A1 selectively interacts with different RNA-binding proteins through its glycine-rich domain [18]. Previous studies have demonstrated hnRNP A1 could interact with N proteins of SARS Coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [14,19]. Since PEDV is also a member of coronavirus and PEDV N protein is a RNA binding protein, it is hypothesized that PEDV N protein might also be able to interact with hnRNP A1 during PEDV infection.",

This phenomenon is very similar to a previous study about MHV [23]. Furthermore, we found that the PEDV N protein and hnRNP A1 co-localized predominantly in the perinuclear region of PEDV infected cells, in which active coronavirus replication/transcription complexes reside.

Overexpression of hnRNPA1 facilitates MHV replication while inhibition of hnRNP A1 expression results in the reduction of MHV replication [26]. Since PEDV is also a member of coronavirus, hnRNP A1 may be involved in the process of PEDV infection. In order to test this hypothesis, we silenced the hnRNP A1 and then studied its effect on PEDV infection. Similar to the result of MHV following silencing hnRNP A1, replication of three PEDV strains were all inhibited, suggesting a positive effect of hnRNP A1 on PEDV infection. Replication of coronavirus depend on the generation of nested subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) with a common capped 5\u2032 leader sequence [28]. Optical transcription of sgmRNAs requires the interaction between its 5\u2032 leader sequence and the intergenic (IG) sequences of each ORF. It has been reported that hnRNP A1 can bind to both the 5\u2032 terminal leader sequences and IG sequences [29]. So, inhibition of PEDV by silencing hnRNP A1 is likely due to the break of the interaction between 5\u2032 terminal leader sequences and IG sequences. However, till now we have not got evidence to support it. In addition, silencing of hnRNP A1 might also be able to reduce its interaction with PEDV N protein. The function of their interaction on PEDV infection is under the investigation of our laboratory.",
