Around 68% of U.S. adults use Facebook [1] which has over 180 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada [2] who spend around 40 min per day on this medium [3]. A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed that in the United States, 24% of adults post about their health experiences on social media with 16% of them posting reviews of medications, treatments, doctors or health [4]. A survey on social media preference among medical students showed 77% of first year medical students and 80% of graduating medical students use Facebook and prefer online media as their primary source of information [5].",

Facebook use for disease surveillance [6] or public health issues [7\u20139] shows its broad scope for improving public health. Researchers have also used Facebook to address specific health concerns. For example, studies have been conducted to assess Facebook\u2019s potential in engaging smokers in smoking cessation treatment [10] and to evaluate it\u2019s scope in recruitment and retention of young adult American veterans into an online alcohol intervention study [11]. While most Facebook based health studies focus on information dissemination to individual users, surprisingly few have focused on how health agencies are involved in Facebook based communications [12\u201314]. This paper addresses this gap.",

Interestingly, while the two organizations differ significantly in the number of Facebook posts they are quite similar in the response (activity/post) generated. Like the CDC, the National Cancer Institute of National Institutes of Health (NIH) also has several thousand posts, but their response is quite low compared to the other two organizations. While it may be that the intent behind a post is to inform rather than to generate a response, differences in engagement are notable. We do not yet understand if there are factors associated with these differences. The nature of public engagement with an organization\u2019s messages is an active focus of research in health sciences and in marketing [24]. This is traditionally studied by surveys of health-information seekers [25, 26]. Studies on engagement can inform organizations about topics of public interest [27] or strategies to increase public reach [28]. In contrast to surveys, our study of engagement on social medial is \u2018observational\u2019 where we assess public activities in response to posts by U.S. Federal health agencies.",

This type of distribution of data where the variance (of activity count) is much greater than the mean implies overdispersed data [42] with zero-inflation [43]. Typically linear models such as Poisson or negative binomial regression are used to model count data. However the zero-inflation and overdispersion (p < 0.001) requires using two-part count data models such as the hurdle regression model [44]. Hurdle models have two separate components: a zero-portion used to fit the sizeable portion of zero counts in the data and a count-portion to fit the non-zero counts of the data. The zero-portion models whether a count is zero (no activity) or not using a binomial probability model. The count portion determines the conditional distribution of the non-zero counts using a zero-truncated negative binomial or Poisson model. Previous studies on social media engagement [10, 45\u201347] have shown the power of hurdle models for modeling data with similar characteristics.",

Our comparison of full and nested models such as hurdle negative binomial and negative binomial using the likelihood ratio test also indicates that the former model fits our data best.

For continuous variables such as log-transformed counts of page likes, a unit increase in these values may change the time to last activity with all other variables remaining constant.

Nineteen out of the 24 Facebook agencies studied here also had accounts on Twitter. Here we compare and contrast the findings from our previous Twitter-based study to our findings from this study. Comparison of accounts from same agencies but across the two platforms shows that Twitter-based accounts post more than Facebook-based accounts. This is likely due of the relative simplicity of Twitter postings. However, Facebook posts on average get more likes, shares or comments than retweet for tweets. In fact, around 27% of Facebook posts get more than 15 total likes, shares and comments, compared to only 10% of tweets that get more than 15 retweets.",

The reasons for this are not quite obvious and we would like to investigate this in future research. In terms of semantic categorization, we find that across both social media platforms posts about activities and behaviors, and phenomenon are positively associated with level of engagement. In contrast, posts about organizations and occupations tend to lower engagement across both platforms.

            "text": "Our research has a few limitations. First, the social media landscape is extremely dynamic. We captured the number of likes, shares and comments as well as the time to last activity of a Facebook post as a snapshot within this dynamic system. Hence the recorded numbers may have changed over time. While our longitudinal data analysis shows that for four out of five posts all activities are generated on the date of the posting itself, we cannot guarantee that a post won\u2019t gather any activity after months or years. This limitation, however, is bound to affect almost any social media based research conducted at a specific point in time and that uses these counts or similar ones as metrics. Second, our study focused only on U.S. Federal health agencies and thus our findings may not be generalizable to other organizations. While we find ample evidence where our findings mirror those of Facebook studies in other domains (as shown in the Discussion section), we would like to investigate the generalizability of our approach in future studies. Third, the intent behind a post is only known to a posting agency. It could be to encourage discussion or to disseminate information. Engagement may not always be the primary motivation of every post or every agency. Hence our results should not be interpreted as general performance metrics for these agencies. Finally, we studied a specific set of features and their correlation to the extent and duration of engagement. While we included many commonly used features as well as some novel ones in this study, there could be other features such as post frequency [58] or posting time [59] that also have correlation to engagement.",

Examination of over 45,000 Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts belonging to 24 U.S. Federal health agencies reveals a wide range of activity across these accounts. We find that a very small fraction of the 45,000 posts get more than 100 likes, shares or comments, while one-fifth of posts see no activity at all. Content analyses of the posts show, for example, that the majority of posts contain links and are generally positive in sentiment. Statistical analyses show that the number of page likes of an account is associated with higher engagement. We also find that posts containing media or links and expressing positive sentiment correlate with higher or longer engagement. Depending on their goals and objectives, these findings may be used as recommendations by the U.S. Federal health agencies for communications on Facebook.",
