Our preliminary studies on goats from different regions of Nigeria have shown the dynamics, pattern and type, and risk factors of pneumonia in goats [2,3]. We also showed that vaccination through the intranasal route induced potent mucosal immunity in goat against peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) [4,5]. None the less, due to the complex nature of caprine pneumonia, it has defied all the attempts at control using only available vaccine hitherto. This probably may be due to the bacteria complications of primary viral infection [6] or presence of multiple pathogens [7] in caprine pneumonia. In Nigeria, the current vaccination for PPRV is stalled by myriad challenges, leading to continuous endemicity in goats.",

More so, harnessing mucosal immune response is an important defense against invading pathogens [8]. Viral pathogens including PPRV, parainfluenza-3, and respiratory syncytial viruses in caprine pneumonia have been reported in our environment, while the role of bacteria including Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh) and Pasteurella multocida (Pm) was also investigated in some of our previous studies [6,9]. However, PPRV and Mh have been responsible for higher percentages of the pneumonic lesions in the goats. Thus, enhancing the mucosal immune response of goats to these organisms will considerably control losses from caprine pneumonia. It was observed that goats vaccinated intranasally against PPRV exhibited better clinical response [5] while that against Mh was not protective in the goats when clinically challenged with PPRV [10]. Thus, there is a need to vaccinate goats with both vaccines through the intranasal route and then challenge in an experimental model, to mimic field or natural conditions. This is to proffer different strategies and framework needed in the prevention and control of the endemic caprine pneumonia in Africa at large.",
