This contact is directed either via membrane\u2010bound receptors or via the secretion of cytokines and lytic granules in response to chemokines on the surface of antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs). The interaction has been termed the immunological synapse (IS), a specialised zone of contact between two immune cells to allow the exchange of materials. Synapses can be formed between two cells, T\u2010cell\u2013T\u2010cell (Dustin et al., 1998; Monks, Freiberg, Kupfer, Sciaky, & Kupfer, 1998), T\u2010cell\u2013B\u2010cell (Batista, Iber, & Neuberger, 2001), and APC\u2013T\u2010cell (Grakoui et al., 1999); however, the majority of work has centred on the latter. Numerous viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus, and herpesvirus have evolved to express viral proteins that specifically target components of the IS with particular emphasis on the T\u2010cell receptor (TCR) signalling cascade and lymphocyte function\u2010associated antigen 1 (LFA\u20101) clustering, both essential for IS formation.",

Some T\u2010lymphotropic viruses have developed a strategy to form a stable adhesive junction between an infected cell (effector) and uninfected cell (target), termed a virological synapse (VS). No fusion events take place between the cells; instead, a junction is formed to transfer intact viral particles or genetic material. This process is termed trans\u2010infection (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000) and has been found to be significantly more efficient than infection via cell\u2010free virus in vitro (Sourisseau, Sol\u2010Foulon, Porrot, Blanchet, & Schwartz, 2007). HIV\u20101 and human T\u2010lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV\u20101) are two examples of viruses that trigger the polarisation of cellular machinery and cytoskeleton to form the VS at the cellular interface (Igakura et al., 2003; Jolly, Mitar, & Sattentau, 2007). Transmission of virus from cell to cell in this manner allows the efficient infection of target cells without exposure to the immune system.",

However, LFA\u20101, ICAM\u20101, and ICAM\u20102 appear to remain unaffected (Thoulouze et al., 2006). This approach allows HIV\u20101 to remain hidden in infected cells by controlling how the cell communicates with the rest of the immune system. An additional advantage to the downmodulation of the expression of viral receptors on the cell surface, such as CD4, helps prevent subsequent reinfection with a closely related viral strain, avoiding \u201csuperinfection\u201d of the cell (reviewed in Nethe, Berkhout, & van der Kuyl, 2005).",

In conjunction with downregulation of CD4 and CD28 (Brady, Pennington, Miles, & Dzierzak, 1993; Swigut et al., 2001) and Nef's ability to disassociate CD4 from Lck and target it for degradation (Kim, Chang, Kwon, & Rhee, 1999), the targeted attack on TCR signalling reduces clustering at the IS and results in inefficient IS formation.",

Nonpathogenic SIV is a prime example of how an efficient block to T\u2010cell activation promotes viral persistence through immune evasion. SIV Nef disrupts the formation of IS between APC and T\u2010cells through the efficient downregulation of TCR and CD28, therefore blocking T\u2010cell responses to virally infected cells and avoiding apoptosis. In the case of HIV\u20101, some studies suggest Nef is less efficient at preventing IS formation due to a weaker downregulation of TCR and CD28 resulting in increased levels of T\u2010cell activation and apoptosis (Arhel et al., 2009). Thus, successfully blocking T\u2010cell activation reduces viral replication permitting prolonged viral production and persistence within the host, whereas failure to actively control T\u2010cell activation increases replication ultimately resulting in increased pathogenicity and disease progression.",

This activity has been attributed to HHV6 U24, which blocks TCR receptors access to recycling endosomes (Sullivan & Coscoy, 2008) and therefore prevents recycling back to the cell surface. Similarly, herpes simplex virus has also developed strategies to remodel TCR signalling to selectively activate TCR pathways. Herpes simplex virus ORF5 is tyrosine phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation and able to interact with SH2 signalling proteins including Lck, which in turn activates TCR signal transduction to promote gene expression and persistent infection (Lee et al., 2004).",

Through the MV and F/H complex, T\u2010cell activation is suppressed (Dubois, Lamy, Chemin, Lachaux, & Kaiserlian, 2001), and actin remodelling, T\u2010cell polarisation, and TCR clustering are inhibited at the IS (Muller et al., 2006; Niewiesk et al., 1999; Shishkova et al., 2007).

            "text": "The VS is a transient, dynamic structure that forms upon recognition by the HIV glycoprotein gp120 expressed in the effector cell by the surface receptor CD4 on the target T\u2010cell. The interaction results in the recruitment of the viral Gag polyprotein to the contact site (Jolly et al., 2007) potentially through an interaction with the tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli protein that directly binds HIV\u20101 Gag, not only regulating the localization of viral components for HIV\u20101 assembly but also enhancing the VS cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission of HIV\u20101 (Miyakawa et al., 2017). This in turn triggers the recruitment of the HIV coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 along with cellular adhesion molecules ICAM\u20101 and LFA\u20101 to the VS. Tetraspanins and other surface proteins help form a stable VS to aid viral transmission (Jolly et al., 2004; Jolly & Sattentau, 2007; Starling & Jolly, 2016). The gp120 interaction with CD4 also induces cytoskeleton rearrangements and remodels the actin cytoskeleton, and LFA\u20101 induces the polarisation of the MTOC to the interface in the infected T\u2010cell (Jolly et al., 2007; Starling & Jolly, 2016). Jolly et al. (2004) observed recruitment of CD4, CXCR4, talin, actin, and LFA\u20101 on the target cell when cocultured with infected T\u2010cells. At the same time, the recruitment of viral Env and Gag to the VS in the infected cell with actin concentrated at the intersection was seen (Figure 1b). More recently, a phosphoproteomic approach to analyse mixed populations of infected and uninfected T\u2010cells identified over 200 cellular proteins involved in viral transfer. Despite the lack of antigen stimulation, TCR signalling was identified as the most activated pathway in both infected and uninfected T\u2010cells. It was concluded that activation of TCR, Lck, and Zap70 in infected T\u2010cells mediated by Env was essential for viral transfer to target T\u2010cells (Len, Starling, Shivkumar, & Jolly, 2017).",

DCs possess several restriction factors to discourage replication, such as dNTP triphosphatase SAMHDI (Berger et al., 2011; Hrecka et al., 2011; Laguette et al., 2011; Ryoo et al., 2014). Interestingly, this is not the case for LC; instead, the cytokine transforming growth factor \u03b2 signalling pathway is able to potently restrict replication at the transcriptional stage (Czubala et al., 2016). Uptake in immature DC (iDC) is mediated via attachment to CD4, coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5 and the c\u2010type lectin DC\u2010SIGN (Arrighi et al., 2004; Geijtenbeek et al., 2000), whereas LCs use alternative c\u2010type lectin, langerin (Hu et al., 2004; Turville et al., 2002). After entry into DC, the transfer to target T\u2010cells can occur by two main routes. Firstly, cis\u2010infection tends to occur in iDC and involves the productive replication and release of progeny virus. The second is trans\u2010infection where DCs capture virions; however, productive infection is absent, and whole intact viral particles are trafficked to T\u2010cells via a VS (Garcia, Nikolic, & Piguet, 2008; Piguet & Steinman, 2007). Trans\u2010infection is associated with mature DC (mDC). Attachment to DC\u2010SIGN allows virus to remain infectious for prolonged periods of time in DC (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000) despite the fact that DCs have a highly developed endolysosomal pathway (Blauvelt et al., 1997; Turville et al., 2004). This may at least in part be attributed to the SNARE\u2010associated protein Snapin downregulating toll\u2010like receptor 8 signalling in infected DC endosomes (Khatamzas et al., 2017). Instead, virus is sequestered in endosomal\u2010derived compartments upon maturation (Garcia et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2017). Compartments are found to be rich in tetraspanins such as CD81, CD82, CD9, and CD63 but absent for lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Garcia et al., 2008, Wang, Eng, et al., 2017). In\u2010depth imaging studies have revealed these to be continuous with the cell membrane (Bennett et al., 2009; Mlcochova, Pelchen\u2010Matthews, & Marsh, 2013; Nkwe, Pelchen\u2010Matthews, Burden, Collinson, & Marsh, 2016), at least in the case of macrophages.",

Disruption of actin remodelling and microtubules with inhibitors has been shown to prevent VS formation highlighting the importance of the role of the actin cytoskeleton in VS formation (Felts et al., 2010; Menager & Littman, 2016; Nikolic et al., 2011).",

In iDC, the formation of membrane extensions is induced via the interaction of HIV Env with DC\u2010SIGN, which in turn activates the GTPase CDC42 (Nikolic et al., 2011). Furthermore, tetraspanin TSPAN7 and dynamin 2 (DNM2) roles in actin nucleation and cortical stabilisation are essential for maintaining viral particles on dendrites (Menager & Littman, 2016). Membrane extensions are thought to allow contact with the uninfected cell and aid the efficient transfer of virus to promote infection.",

In a recent study, Murooka et al. show HIV\u20101\u2010infected T\u2010cells contribute to the systemic infection in a humanised mouse model where productively infected T\u2010cells were visualised migrating to lymph nodes. A subset of cells were observed forming syncytia and adhering to CD4+ lymph node cells resulting in the formation of membrane tethers that may facilitate cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread (Murooka et al., 2012; Sewald, Motamedi, & Mothes, 2016). It was later shown that murine leukaemia virus and HIV\u20101 are captured by CD169/Siglec\u20101 expressed on the cell surface of macrophages. The macrophages formed synapses between B\u20101 cells that migrate into lymph nodes to continue to spread via VS, showing the importance of CD169 in viral spread (Sewald et al., 2015). In 2016, Law et al. looked at the genetic patterns of HIV\u20101 infection and found the cotransmission of two viral genotypes and the microclustering of infected cells formed, harbouring the same genotype within lymphoid tissue. HIV\u20101\u2010infected cells were able to induce the arrest of the interacting CD4+ T\u2010cells through Env\u2010dependent cell contacts (Law et al., 2016). Understanding cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread in various tissue types will be vital to the development of effective antiviral strategies in the future to block viral transmission to target cells.",

            "text": "Infection with HTLV\u20101 has been implicated in several diseases including adult T\u2010cell lymphoma and a range of inflammatory diseases. The primary target of HTLV\u20101 is CD4+ T\u2010cells; however, there is evidence for infection of a range of immune cells including DC (Knight, Macatonia, Cruickshank, Rudge, & Patterson, 1993; Macatonia, Cruickshank, Rudge, & Knight, 1992), macrophages (Nath, Ruscetti, Petrow\u2010Sadowski, & Jones, 2003), B\u2010cells (Koyanagi et al., 1993), and CD8+ T\u2010cells (Hanon et al., 2000). The virus is taken into T\u2010cells via the receptor GLUT1 (Manel et al., 2003); however, unlike HIV\u20101 transmission, HTLV\u20101 is dependent entirely on cell\u2010to\u2010cell contact. Once infected, viral transmission is initiated via the binding of adhesion molecule ICAM\u20101 on the surface of the infected cell and LFA\u20101 on the surface of the target cell (Kim, Nair, Fernandez, Mathes, & Lairmore, 2006). This is in addition to the interaction of the viral Tax protein with ICAM\u20101 that appears to promote MTOC polarisation to the contact site (Nejmeddine, Barnard, Tanaka, Taylor, & Bangham, 2005). Viral Env glycoprotein, core proteins p19 and p15, and adhesion molecule talin all polarise towards the junction with the virus receptor GLUT\u20101 (Takenouchi et al., 2007), which along with neurophilin 1 (Ghez et al., 2006) and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (Pinon et al., 2003) are thought to strengthen the cell\u2010to\u2010cell adhesion. Interestingly, the HTLV VS appears to have a more ordered structure than HIV\u20101 VS, due to the recruitment of talin that forms a ring\u2010like structure, similar to the pSMAC of IS (Igakura et al., 2003). It has been reported that the HTLV\u20101 protein P8 downregulates TCR signalling (Fukumoto et al., 2007, 2009), increasing cell contact through interaction with LFA\u20101 clustering and controlling membrane extensions between T\u2010cells (Van Prooyen et al., 2010). Additionally, there is evidence for an alternative route of transmission via extracellular biofilms. The biofilm is believed to store virus particles on the cell surface in carbohydrate\u2010rich matrices consisting of collagen, agrin, tetherin, and galectin, which transfer between cells upon contact (Pais\u2010Correia et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Transmission of virus via the VS may provide many advantages to viral survival by evading detection by the host immune system and establishing a latent reservoir of infection between immune cells. This mode of viral transmission has potentially important considerations for existing drug therapies. For example, HIV\u20101 transmitted cell to cell requires greater concentrations of broadly neutralising antibodies to neutralise virus when compared with cell\u2010free virus. In a recent study, several broadly neutralising antibodies were found to have a decreased capacity to neutralise virus isolated from HIV\u20101 patients in a transfer assay compared with cell\u2010free virus (Li, Zony, Chen, & Chen, 2017). Moreover, even though virus transferred via VS is still susceptible to antiretroviral treatment, it is thought to be less sensitive to some commonly used antiretrovirals than cell\u2010free virus (Sigal et al., 2011). This reduction in sensitivity has been attributed to the accumulation of viral particles at the VS reducing the virus's overall susceptibility to treatment (Duncan, Russell, & Sattentau, 2013). Reduced sensitivity to existing treatments could potentially encourage viral immune escape and contribute to viral persistence in patients, which is an important consideration for future vaccine development.",

            "text": "The formation of the VS provides a powerful and effective route for viral transmission for retroviruses such as HIV\u20101 and HTLV\u20101; however, recent studies are suggesting this maybe a common mode of transmission between immune cells. A good example is the infection of memory B\u2010cells with EBV, which results in the recruitment of adhesion molecules and the transfer of virus to polarised epithelial cells (Shannon\u2010Lowe & Rowe, 2011). Recently, Wang et al. demonstrate that the flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, is taken into DC via DC\u2010SIGN and plays an important role in trans\u2010infection to T\u2010cells. Imaging showed the transfer of JEV viral particles from DC to T\u2010cells via cell\u2010to\u2010cell contact and formation of VS (Wang et al., 2017). Similarly, Yang et al. demonstrate that SARS coronavirus, which also uses DC\u2010SIGN as an attachment receptor, is transferred between DC and target cells via a structure similar to the HIV\u20101 VS (Yang et al., 2004). As DC\u2010SIGN has been reported as an attachment receptor for several other viruses including Ebola (Alvarez et al., 2002), dengue (Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003), human cytomegalovirus (Halary et al., 2002), HIV\u20102 and SIV (Pohlmann et al., 2001), and HCV (Wang, Feng, Nie, & Zhou, 2004), it seems plausible that many more diverse viruses use similar methods for transmission to permissible cells.",

The addition of GM3 to the virus\u2010like nanoparticles was enough to deliver the conjugate to CD81+ compartments that accumulated at the junction between mDC and T\u2010cells, resembling the structure of a VS (Yu et al., 2015). Another promising approach incorporates the delivery of CCR5 siRNA encapsulated in liposomes coated in antibodies against LFA\u20101. Mice challenged with HIV after treatment with the CCR5 liposomes maintained CD4+ cell count and a twofold reduction in viral load (Kim et al., 2010). Overall, the targeted delivery to immune cells via LFA\u20101 appears as a promising approach at preventing viral spread (Figure 1d).",
