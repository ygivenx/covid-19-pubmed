            "text": "After birth, the gastrointestinal tract (GI) of a newborn calf undergoes morphological and functional adaptations, which starts with the ingestion of colostrum affecting the gastrointestinal motility as well as the acquisition of the passive immunity [1, 2]. In addition to the gastrointestinal maturation, the calf has to adapt to a new environment, which is loaded with pathogens, thermoregulate its own body and transition from pre-ruminant to ruminant during the weaning period. Together, these factors can prone calves to develop diarrhea, which is the leading cause of mortality in neonatal dairy calves in the US during the first 4 weeks of life [3]. Fecal score is commonly used by researchers and dairy producers to keep track and identify young animals with diarrhea. Also, more sophisticated methods such as microscopy and bacterial culturing have been used to identifying specific strains of infectious pathogens causing diarrhea. Blood biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolism are useful indicators of overall animal health. However, these analyses along with fecal score do not provide additional information on the actual biological adaptations the GI tract undergoes during the onset of diarrhea. Epithelial cells from the GI tract act as a barrier against pathogens, and the daily shedding of these cells into feces has been used in rodents and humans as a source of RNA to evaluate gene expression in the GI tract [4]. The exfoliation of these cells has been associated with intestinal natural turnover process to preserve tissue structure [5]. This is a noninvasive method that can be used instead of performing tissue biopsies and postmortem tissue analysis [6]. Originally, RNA from fecal samples was used for detecting molecular biomarkers of colon cancer in rats [7, 8] and later for intestinal development and function in adult humans [9, 10]. The basis for using fecal RNA is that, unlike mammalian RNA, bacteria RNA lacks a polyA tail making possible to discriminate between RNA from the host and RNA from bacteria by targeting RNA with the polyA. Certain strains of fungi, which are also considered pathogens, can produce polyA tail [11, 12], however, the extent and influence of these strains in the fecal RNA remain unknown. In humans, the RNA isolated from stool samples were used to study nutritional regimens [13], as well as, to quantify intestinal gene expression profiles in developing human infants [14]. In fact, in the latter study, using fecal RNA, Chapkin and collaborators [14] were able to differentiate between neonates that were breastfed and formula-fed by their different transcriptome profile. These data underscore the potential of the fecal RNA method to study biological alterations to the GI tract product of nutritional effects. Similarly, such method could be applied to study the effects of inflammatory conditions arise from diarrhea in neonatal dairy calves.",

The increased concentration of glucose throughout this trial can be associated with a physiological response, where neonates have to develop their gluconeogenesis pathway to generate endogenous energy to reach the normal metabolism [27].

[29], reporting creatinine values from 80.4 (wk 2) to 67.2 \u03bcmol/L (wk 12) and in both experiments creatinine levels decreased with age. The latter suggests that creatinine levels at birth might be associated with a transfer from maternal creatinine as observed in humans [30]. The overall increase in blood urea in our study is associated with the development of the ruminal fermentation, which has been demonstrated that blood urea concentrations in dairy calves increase over time due to rumen development stimulated by solid feed, especially after weaning [31]. Also, plasma urea concentration increased in neonatal dairy calves, when calves began to consume greater amounts of grain [32, 33] which result in greater production of ruminal ammonia, and consequently more metabolized urea into the bloodstream.",

In contrast, greater blood GGT and GOT are associated with liver cell damage [34]. Therefore, in the current study, the linear increase of cholesterol, albumin, and PON in the blood of calves does not suggest a liver dysfunction even during 2 wk of age when the fecal score was maximal. In addition, the clearance of total bilirubin in blood is associated with a progressive increase in liver function (Fig 3). The high GGT concentration at wk 0 can be associated with colostrum intake, as this enzyme is present in high levels in colostrum (Gungor et al., 2004). Then, the decreased GGT concentration over time is in accordance with other studies in neonatal dairy calves [35, 36].",

The process of phagocytosis by which leukocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages can destroy invading pathogens can also lead to increased production of ROM [37]. The fact that ROM reached a maximum level in blood at 2 wk of age (19 mg H2O2/100 mL), together with the decrease in FRAP concentration (antioxidant parameter; Fig 5) during the same time which calves experienced an increase in the fecal score. Taken these data together, suggest that this is a physiological response during a period of stress such as diarrhea. Therefore, increased ROM could be associated with the increase in diarrhea events leading to a potential increase phagocytosis, arachidonic acid metabolism, oxidation of tissue reserves, among other mechanisms to counteract this condition [38].",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) present in the cell membrane can identify an invading pathogen, and start an intracellular signaling pathway with the purpose to activate the transcription factor NFKB1 which promotes the transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory proteins (e.g., cytokines and chemokines), such as IL1B, TNFA, IL6 and IL8 [39]. Among TLRs, TLR2 and TLR4 are perhaps the most widely studied, which recognize components of the bacterial cell walls such as lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively [40]. Therefore, it is plausible that the upregulation of TLR4 mRNA expression observed in fecal samples was triggered by the presence of gram-negative bacteria (i.e., E. coli). Similar responses have been observed in other tissues such as the mammary gland where an upregulation of TLR4 was observed in dairy cows experiencing an inflammatory condition due to LPS [41, 42] or E. coli challenge [43]. Among the limited data on TLR4 expression in GI tract in dairy calves, Malmuthuge et al. [44] did not observe differences in TLR4 expression across several GI tract tissues (i.e., rumen, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) in 3 wk-old calves. Although an upregulation of TLR4 was observed with a maximal expression at 4 wk, this does not precisely overlap with the increase in fecal scores at 1 wk. However, the latter could be associated with an alternative pathogen and consequently mechanism, other than TLR4 pathway, responsible for triggering the increased fecal scores at 1 wk. Certainly, there still much to know regarding the GI tract of neonatal calves, for instance, Ontsouka et al. [45] described the importance in the maturation of the GI tract in neonatal calves and how bioactive substance in colostrum can affect this maturation. Therefore, the latter could be another potential explanation for the delay observed in TLR4 with respect of the increased fecal scores in 1 wk observed in this study.",

During inflammation, IL-6 can be synthesized by the intestinal mucosa and enterocyte by which stimulates enterocytes production of +APP [55, 56]. Upon an inflammatory condition, the APR increases hepatic synthesis of positive acute phase proteins (+APP) such as SAA, ceruloplasmin, and haptoglobin, and the concomitant decrease in the production of negative acute phase proteins (-APP), such as albumin and apolipoproteins [34, 57]. The results of this study showed a simultaneous increase in IL-6 in blood and fecal scores, which indicates that calves underwent an inflammatory response. In fact, Fischer et al. [58] reported that serum IL-6 is a reliable biomarker for the inflammatory response to diarrhea in calves. The latter was further confirmed by increased concentrations of +APP such as ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, and SAA which has been observed previously in neonatal dairy calves infected with Salmonella [56, 59, 60] and inoculated with bovine viral diarrhea virus [61]. As expected inoculation with Salmonella causes diarrhea resulting in a fecal score of 2.5 [60], which is in agreement with our study. Overall, in our study, the pattern of fecal score and pro-inflammatory blood biomarkers (peaking both between 2 and 3 wk of age) indicate a pro-inflammatory response during diarrhea in neonatal dairy calves. The inflammatory response observed in fecal RNA did not overlap with that observed in fecal scores and blood biomarkers at 2 and 3 wk. However, the fact that inflammation-related genes in fecal RNA followed a similar pattern as fecal scores and blood biomarkers of inflammation provide support for fecal RNA being a promising method to study intestinal response to inflammation and its variation over time in neonatal dairy calves. Future improvements to the fecal RNA method will consolidate its reliability to study gut health and response to inflammation, dietary conditions, and growth among others.",

After glucose, galactose, and fructose are transported into the enterocytes, these are further translocated out of the cell into the portal venous system through the facilitated transporter GLUT2 present in the basolateral membrane [63]. Previous work in colonic human cells and rabbits showed a decrease in the mRNA expression of SLC5A1 in response to an inflammatory condition induced by synthetic TNF\u03b1 [64, 65]. Similarly, the downregulation of SLC5A1 in fecal RNA can be partially related to the time of increased inflammatory response observed in blood biomarkers and fecal score. Thus, the decreased expression of SLC5A1 around the same time of the diarrhea could be suggestive of a physiological response to an inflammatory condition.",

The hepatic mRNA expression of SLC2A2 was downregulated overtime in transition calves from preruminant to ruminants [67], indicating a decreased in the flux of glucose in the portal vein. Therefore, the downregulation overtime in SLC2A2 expression in the fecal samples can be associated with the transition from preruminant to ruminant in those calves, where SLC2A2 expression decreased as the rumen functionality increased.",

Previous studies have shown that AQP3 is down-regulated during inflammatory bowel disease in humans [70] and rats [71]. Indeed, it was reported that during bacterial-induced diarrhea in mice the flux of water through the enterocytes is altered compared to a healthy gut environment, where water flux in bacterial-induced diarrhea is blocked from entering or exiting the lumen of the intestine into the epithelium, mainly due to the mislocalization of Aquaporin-3 within the enterocytes [72]. Thus, the reduced AQP3 expression observed in the fecal RNA during diarrhea in the present study might be an indication of restricted water exchange between the intestinal lumen and epithelium as a physiological response to diarrhea.",

Such a response confirmed our hypothesis, where physiological changes such as inflammation in response to diarrhea could be detected through transcriptional alterations in fresh fecal samples from neonatal dairy calves. Although further optimization to this method is required in the future, results from this study suggest that RNA isolated from fecal samples has a potential to be a reliable tool to evaluate physiological changes not only due to diarrhea but also to other factors such as dietary treatments.",
