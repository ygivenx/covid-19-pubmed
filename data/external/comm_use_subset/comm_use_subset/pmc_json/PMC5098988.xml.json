As such, they do not allow for changes in human behaviour which in turn are likely to impact the rate of transmission in a population. Such behavioural changes in response to disease outbreaks are well established [2]. This includes self-imposed social distancing during influenza pandemics [3], and the usage of face masks and changes in travel behaviour during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002\u20132004 [4]. The term prevalence elastic behaviour has arisen to explain voluntary protective behaviour which increases with disease prevalence [5], as has been observed for both measles [6] and HIV [7].",

            "text": "The close to real-time awareness of disease prevalence in an outbreak is now common due to the relatively recent explosion in mass and social media. The past decade has seen significant growth in studies concerning the interaction of media, human behaviour and infectious disease dynamics, and there now exists a substantial body of work on this topic [2,8\u201314]. Despite this growth, empirical studies of prevalence elastic behaviour due to mass media have until recently been difficult due to the lack of availability of data directly measuring media engagement and relating it to behavioural change. As such, the vast majority of studies in this area can be broadly classified into two groups, with slightly different motivations. First, pure mathematical models of behavioural change, in which a model is formulated that accounts for how dynamics are influenced by disease awareness or prevalence, typically facilitated through media\u2014these are often either in the form of introducing new states which account for the behavioural status of individuals [15], by allowing modification to the contact structure [3,16], or by allowing modification to the model parameters [17,18]\u2014and the consequences are then explored. Collinson et al. [13] model behavioural change due to media by explicitly including a compartment for individuals influenced by mass media into an SEIR-type model, also incorporating effects like vaccination and social distancing [13]. This study is of particular interest due to the fact that it incorporates a \u2018media fatigue\u2019 effect during the 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic by fitting to news report data collected from newspaper homepages during the pandemic. Second, pure statistical models of media and prevalence are used on large datasets to produce statistical regression models relating some measure of volume of media concerning epidemics to the prevalence of infection [9,10] or reproductive number [19]. Such models have recently become popular due to the rapid increase in new data streams coming from Internet and online social media usage [20,21]. The study of Signorini et al. [11] is an exception to this trend: while it is a pure statistical model, it includes an investigation of the relationship between \u2018tweets\u2019 on Twitter and public sentiment with respect to H1N1 [11]. The FluOutlook platform [14] is also particularly interesting; by using a variety of data sources, including Twitter, to initialize a global agent-based epidemiological model it is able to produce real-time forecasts of an evolving influenza season.",

We measure disease dynamics through influenza incidence data from the United States over the period 1998/1999\u20132014/2015, and human behaviour through social media data collected from Twitter over the period 2009/2010\u20132014/2015. Modification to the effective transmission rate is via a so-called media function. Three distinct media functions have been introduced, and recently compared, in the literature [22]. A potential criticism of pure mathematical model-based studies, as described above, is that the usefulness of the model when analysing real data is uncertain. In fact, as we will show here, some of these models have only very limited use in describing data coming from historical influenza outbreaks. On the other hand, while pure statistical models of media and prevalence are potentially of use for detecting and tracking disease incidence, they are subject to typical criticisms of \u2018big data\u2019 analyses [23] as containing biases and tending towards overfitting. As such, their usefulness for understanding potential mechanisms of impacts, as is the focus of model-based analyses, is limited.",

Our approach uses online social media data from Twitter alongside surveillance data on influenza to inform the form of the media function. The motivation is that by using both sources of data, we have some empirical justification for the form of the chosen media function and can also better describe real observations. By using model selection criteria, we show that the media function proposed here fits historical surveillance data better than other media functions proposed in earlier studies.",

Consequently, 0\u2264f(I)\u22641 with f(I)\u22611 implying no effect of media upon transmission, and we will assume f(I) is monotonically decreasing in I. Setting f(I)\u22611 recovers the standard SEEIIR model. As f(0)=1 for each media function, the basic reproduction number R0=\u03b2/\u03b3, which is independent of f(I). The two compartments for the exposed and infectious periods mean that these periods have underlying Erlang-2 distributions with mean exposed and infectious periods 1/\u03c3 and 1/\u03b3 respectively, which have been shown to more accurately represent the shape of observed distributions [24]. We found similar results using standard SEIR-type models; these results are presented in the electronic supplementary material. Note that we have not included vaccination in our model, for two reasons: firstly, for comparison with media models from previous studies (see below) which use SEIR-type models without vaccination; and secondly, because vaccination coverage in adults has remained approximately constant since 2010 [25] and the Twitter data we will study primarily relates to media reporting around the peak of the influenza season rather than the earlier peak of the vaccination season. Our model, therefore, can essentially be considered as a model for influenza dynamics in the unvaccinated portion of the population.",

The data on weekly counts of ILI activity and retweeting rates used can be found in the electronic supplementary material.

We show linear and quadratic fits for this season as well as 2014/2015 in the subplots below the main figure.

Indeed, we found that the relative likelihood of the quadratic model increased with the total number of ILI cases per season (see electronic supplementary material), suggesting that nonlinear media effects may become increasingly relevant during more severe outbreaks. We also present residual plots for the linear and quadratic models for all years in the electronic supplementary material, showing no obvious non-random patterns for the model fits, along with further details of the AIC model selection and a table of relative Akaike weights for all years.

In figure 5, we show the average conditional probability of selecting each model as a function of the number of weeks of data used before the peak. The no media and fm models are always preferred over the other media function models (i.e. using f1, f2 and f3), with the fm model being preferred up until around 10\u201312 weeks before the peak. When fitting data earlier than 12 weeks before the peak the no media model is preferred, suggesting that the effect of media coverage becomes more important later in the season. Furthermore, neither model is able to reliably predict the peak of the infection in terms of either size or timing based upon data from before the peak only. This suggests that in order to make accurate predictions and estimate parameters rather than explain an existing dataset when only small amounts of data are available, we must use a more advanced methodology such as data assimilation [32].\n",

When incorporated into a deterministic SEEIIR model, this media function describes incidence data better than a model without media effects, and better than previously proposed media functions. We observed a relationship between outbreak size and media awareness, with a quadratic model becoming more likely as the final size of the outbreak increased. This suggests that the relationship between media coverage and infection rates is nonlinear, especially in more severe seasons. Future extensions to the media function could incorporate extra reductions in disease transmission due to factors such as early media coverage, pre-existing immunity or seasonality. Public awareness campaigns could lead to an increase in early-season social media activity and sharing of news articles, and could be implemented in the current model via a time lag. Indeed, we observed such an effect for the 2014/2015 season, where changes in retweeting activity preceded ILI rates by a number of weeks. Mass media campaigns have been shown to increase flu-related hospital visits [33] and vaccination rates [34,35]. It is further possible that any potential reduction in transmission in one season due to the effects of mass media could decrease pre-existing immunity for the next season, an effect which could be modelled by conditioning the media function on the total amount of media engagement from the previous season. Identifying any such potential process is of course confounded by the presence of multiple influenza strains circulating in any particular season with differing levels of pre-exisitng immunity; modelling such a hierarchy of time-lagged effects requires a more sophisticated strategy and is left for future work.",

This is of course far from being the case for Twitter users\u2014indeed, it is well known that the demographics of Twitter use in the United States are biased towards adults aged 18\u201329, African-Americans and urban residents [39], and word usage has been shown to correlate with a number of socio-economic and health characteristics [40,41]. Despite these biases, the approximately 10% of American adults who are estimated to use Twitter represents a far larger sample size than those of traditional surveys. Furthermore, for simplicity and because the keywords we used were sufficiently specific, we did not filter tweets for relevance. Manual examination of a sample of tweets indicated that an insignificant number of tweets were misclassified as being about influenza; however, constraining the tweet corpus may lead to further improvements in the results.",
