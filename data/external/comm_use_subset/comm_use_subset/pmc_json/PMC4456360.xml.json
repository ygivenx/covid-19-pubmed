Correlation of inflammation or metastasis with overexpression of sialylated and fucosylated epitopes, such as sialyl Lewis x has been the subject of intensive research. However, in other cases, the very active metabolism and divison of cancer cells can result in the abnormal exposure of cryptic epitopes. This internal part of glycoconjugates, that would have been decorated by other monosaccharides in normal cells, may therefore be exposed on the cell surface and become available for detection by antibodies or lectins [4].",

GlcNAc is also present in the branches of these glycoconjugates, either \u03b21-2-linked to mannose (Man) on the trimannose core or \u03b21-3-linked to galactose (Gal) as part of polylactosamine extended branches (Fig 1A). Nevertheless, due to the activity of galactosyltransferases and sialyltransferases, these GlcNAc residues are not in terminal positions in normal tissues. Similarly glycosphingolipids contain GlcNAc\u03b21\u20133 or \u03b21\u20136 linked to Gal but not in exposed terminal positions. The epitopes are similar in mucins with Gal, sialic acid (Neu5Ac) or fucose (Fuc) residues capping the terminal epitopes.

A new technology is the use of lectin arrays that can contain lectins with large spectra of specificity and therefore characterize variation of glycosylation [10]. The use of lectins extracted from natural organisms may be time-consuming and may generate problems of contamination or variations between batches. Therefore, recombinant lectin technology is starting to be developed [11]. Lectins that are classically used for GlcNAc-binding are extracted from plants such as wheat (WGA), tomato (SLT) and Griffonia simplicifolia (GSL-II). A new GlcNAc-specific lectin (PVL) was purified from the fruiting bodies and mycelium of a fungus, Psathyrella velutina [12] and then structurally characterized [13]. A closely related protein, lectin 2 from mushroom Agrocybe aegerita (AAL-2) has been recently cloned and demonstrated to bind to hepatoma cells [14]. The PVL structure presents a novel fold among lectins, with seven \u03b2-sheets arranged in a \u03b2-propeller fold. The lectin therefore adopts a donut shape with six GlcNAc binding sites, and is expected to present strong avidity for cell surfaces presenting high density of terminal GlcNAc residues.",

It was introduced into the expression vector pET25b using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The pET25-rPVL vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and cells harboring pET25-rPVL plasmid were grown in LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg ml-1 ampicillin at 37\u00b0C until A600 reached 0.7. The cells were then cultured for 16 h after addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside. After centrifugation (7000 x g for 15 min), bacteria were resuspended in equilibration buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and broken by cell disruption at a pressure of 1.7 kilobars (Constant systems Ltd). After centrifugation (50000 x g, 30 min at 4\u00b0C) and filtration, affinity chromatography on a GlcNAc-agarose column (EY laboratories inc.) was performed on the supernatant. rPVL was allowed to bind to immobilized GlcNAc in equilibration buffer, and after washing (20 mMTris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl), it was eluted with 200 mM of free GlcNAc in equilibration buffer. Purified protein was dialyzed extensively against ultrapure water for 7 days, freeze-dried, and stored at 4\u00b0C.",

Because of multivalency effect, the signal was maximal for multiantennary structures (2 to 5 antenna) with lactosamine repeats, the occurrence of which is related to cancer progression [27]. Polylactosamine bi- or multi-antennary N-glycans with terminal GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal were bound with fluorescence signals higher than 1500 RU, while the ones with terminal Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc are in the background noise, below 150 RU. No binding is observed to the GlcNAc\u03b21-4Man motif present in bisected N-glycans, but the presence of this bisecting GlcNAc does not hinder the binding of PVL to neighboring GlcNAc-terminated antenna. The lectin also bound to mucin motifs that bear \u03b2GlcNAc on position 3 and 6 of a GalNAc residue (type 4). It bound only weakly to the chitobiose motif (GlcNAc\u03b21-4GlcNAc) of chitin. The lectin is not selective for the anomeric configuration of the GlcNAc and several oligosaccharides with terminal \u03b1GlcNAc residues were also labeled. Such epitopes are present in human heparan sulfate (GlcNAc \u03b11-4IdoA) and in mucins of gastric glands (GlcNAc \u03b11-4Gal) [5], but also in class III mucin of carcinoma tissues that express a gastric phenotype [28]. The glycan array contains a variety of oligosaccharides with terminal GalNAc but PVL binding was observed only to the disaccharide GalNAc\u03b21-3GalNAc (#97) with minor intensity.",

The affinity for GlcNAc is in the same range as that previously measured by ITC with native PVL isolated from mushroom (Kd \u2248200 \u03bcM) [13]. Quantitative measurements confirmed a stronger affinity for GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal-terminated structures than for GlcNAc and chitooligosaccharides, with dissociation constant of about 70 \u03bcM for the trisaccharide lacto-N-triose. A good agreement was observed between values measured by both methods. Only the N-glycan heptasaccharide presenting two terminal GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man epitopes showed stronger affinity for rPVL in solution (Kd of 34 \u03bcM) than on SPR chip. This may be due to the bivalent character of this particular interaction that may be more easily established with the protein in solution than fixed on a chip. The binding of both terminal GlcNAc residues of the biantennary heptasaccharide was confirmed by comparing the stoichiometry of linear GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal (five ligands per rPVL) and of biantennary heptasaccharide (two ligands per rPVL). The thermodynamics of binding was also different since the biantennary glycan is the only one to present a favorable entropy of binding (Table 1), that could be explained by the preorientation of the two GlcNAc residues in space.",

Since the glycan microarray showed some binding to Neu5Ac containing glycans, sialidase treatment was performed in order to determine if Neu5Ac-terminated cell surface glycans could be recognized by the lectin. As shown on Fig 4A, following sialidase treatment, cell staining was almost completely lost for the HBEC-3KT cell line, but much less so for other cell lines such as MCF-7 or A549.

As a control for specificity, 2F-fucose, an inhibitor of fucosyltransferases was used (Fig 5A). The latter compound did not affect binding of either the Neu5Ac-specific lectin MAH or of rPVL. By contrast, 3F-Neu5Ac, decreased MAH binding by 75%, as expected, but also rPVL binding by 59%, indicating that a significant level of rPVL binding to these cells is due to recognition of Neu5Ac epitopes. Treatment of A549 cells by an exo \u00df-D-N-acetyl\u2014hexosaminidase also resulted in a major decrease of rPVL binding in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GlcNAc-terminated glycans are also recognized by rPVL on this cell line. To further delineate which type of glycans are involved, A549 cells were treated with kifunensin, an inhibitor of N-glycan maturation, with benzyl-GalNAc, an inhibitor of O-glycosylation and with PPMP, an inhibitor of glycolipid synthesis (Fig 5B). Treatment by all three inhibitors resulted in a decrease of the MAH Neu5Ac-specific lectin, indicating that Neu5Ac termini are present on these three major types of glycans. Likewise, each inhibitor decreased rPVL binding to some extent. Yet, inhibition of rPVL binding was much clearer following benzyl-GalNAc treatment than following the other treatments. Collectively, these data indicate that both Neu5Ac and GlcNAc present on O-glycans constitute the major ligands for rPVL binding on the A549 lung carcinoma cell line.",

F17G, a lectin present on the pili of some E. coli strains, has also recently been shown to specifically recognize terminal GlcNAc\u00df1-3Gal motifs, although with a rather low affinity [33]. The lectin with the closest specificity pattern to PVL is AAL-2 from the mushroom Agrocybe aegerita. This related protein (60% identity) has also been produced recombinantly and demonstrated to bind to hepatoma cells and to induce apoptosis, although no information was provided on the binding event.

Since we aim at targeting specifically GlcNAc-terminated residues, we demonstrated that the use of sialidase treatment and/or competition with low amounts of GlcNAc suppressed the non-specific binding.
