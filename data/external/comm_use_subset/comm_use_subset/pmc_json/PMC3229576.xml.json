            "text": "We have developed a yeast-based assay and screening method to identify small molecules that block SARS-CoV replication based on their inhibition of PLP. The basis for the screen is that forced expression of PLP in S. cerevisiae causes a pronounced slow growth phenotype. Using this finding we screened a small molecule library for compounds that specifically reversed the PLP-induced slow growth phenotype. These compounds were then tested in cell culture models for efficacy against SARS-CoV replication, as well as the known enzymatic functions of PLP. Here we report that of 5 compounds that reversed the slow growth phenotype in yeast; 1 compound, NSC158362, also significantly blocked SARS-CoV replication in vitro with an EC50 <1 \u00b5M. This effect was specific for SARS-CoV replication because no effect on influenza virus replication was observed with up to 50 \u00b5M of the inhibitory compound. A second compound, NSC158011, was able to inhibit PLP-dependent protease activity in a cell culture assay but this effect did not appear strong enough to block virus replication. Interestingly, NSC158362 failed to block the protease, deubiquitinase or anti-IFN activities of PLP. This suggests that its target is either a novel activity of PLP or is a cellular protein that regulates PLP function in infected cells, thus representing new avenues of therapeutic intervention for SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Previously we reported that expression of the influenza virus NS1 protein in yeast resulted in a slow growth phenotype that could be used to screen for specific small molecule antagonists of NS1 [16]. We reasoned that expression of SARS-CoV proteins in yeast may modulate cellular processes including signaling pathways, as they do in mammalian cells, allowing for a genetic system to analyze their function and the capability to identify compounds that alter that function. We focused on the PLP protease domain of the viral nsp3 protein because of its requirement in virus infection [17]. Sequences corresponding to the PLP domain were cloned into a plasmid containing the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter for controlled expression in S. cerevisiae. The plasmid was transformed into a modified strain of S. cerevisiae that carries disrupted alleles for two genes that control drug efflux, PDR1 and PDR3, thus allowing for the efficient retention of small molecules [16]. Shown in Figure 1A is a galactose induction experiment of the PLP expressing strain demonstrating increasing induction with increasing galactose concentration. High-level expression of PLP was observed with as little as 0.1% galactose, and 2% galactose was chosen for further studies. We next analyzed the effect of PLP expression on yeast growth in liquid media. Growth in medium containing glucose, which represses GAL1-driven expression, resulted in both the control and PLP strains growing equally well, as expected (data not shown). Growth in galactose-containing medium was performed over a 60 hour time course and the results are shown in Figure 1B. There was a clear growth inhibition due to expression of PLP, with the maximal differential between control and PLP strains occurring between 30 and 50 hours after initiating growth in galactose-containing medium.",

Of the five compounds tested, NSC158362 reduced the viral titer by 100 fold at 12 hours post infection and greater than 500 fold at 24 hours post infection (Figure 4A,B). At 12 hours post infection strong fluorescence was seen for DMSO-treated cells and those treated with NSC1614, NSC158011, NSC112796 and NSC211736. Additionally, we observed a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) in these cells as well as evidenced by rounding up, cell fusion and ruffling of the plasma membrane (not shown). However in cells treated with NSC158362 minimal GFP expression and CPE was observed. Therefore by two independent measurements, plaque assay and GFP expression; our data indicate that NSC158362 exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in cell culture.",

We therefore used human airway epithelial cells (HAE) to further assess the in vitro efficacy of NSC158362 (Figure 5). HAEs are derived from primary human airway cells and are grown on trans-wells that result in an air-liquid interface where the apical surface of the well contains beating cilia, clara cells and goblet cells with very little media remaining on the surface[19]. The basolateral surface is bathed in growth media similar to the architecture of lungs in vivo. HAEs were treated with either DMSO or NSC158362 on the apical and basolateral surface for 2 hours prior to infection. SARS-CoV/GFP was added to the apical surface of the transwell at an MOI of 3 for 1 hour in a volume of 100 \u00b5l. At 1 hour, the wells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 3 days in the presence of NSC158362 at 50 \u00b5M. A previous study showed that SARS-CoV is only released from the apical surface of HAEs[20]. At 24, 48 and 72 hours post infection the apical surface was washed with 200 \u00b5l of PBS and that apical wash used to assay the growth of the virus by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells as above (Figure 5). SARS-CoV infection of DMSO-treated HAEs had titers that of 2\u00d710\u22277 pfu/ml at 72 hours post infection. However, SARS-CoV infected HAEs treated with NSC158362 had a titer of 4\u00d710\u22275 pfu/ml at 72 hours post infection, a >50 fold reduction in titer. This demonstrates that NSC158362 is effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in a physiologically relevant cell type.",

As the world's human population expands and interacts more and more with the environment, an increase in viral outbreaks is inevitable. We have developed a novel screen for antiviral compounds that is rapid, direct and does not rely on previous knowledge of a viral protein's function. The yeast based screen described here was used to identify an antiviral compound directed against the SARS-CoV papain-like protease. While the function of PLP in SARS-CoV replication largely understood, this was not necessary for the yeast-based screening methodology described here to be successful. Initially, several SARS-CoV proteins were tested in S. cerevisiae for their ability to inhibit yeast cell growth in an inducible manner (not shown). Once identified as strongly growth inhibited by PLP, yeast were then challenged with the 2000 member NIH Diversity Set for compounds that reversed the inhibition of yeast cell growth. Five compounds passed the screen and those were tested against SARS-CoV infection in vitro, of which 1 compound proved to be a potent antiviral.",

These include (1) direct inhibition of the protease activity (2) inhibition of a cellular protein whose function is required for PLP activity in cells or (3) triggering the degradation of PLP by direct binding or other mechanisms. With the exception of NSC158011's effect on protease activity, our assays showed that none of the compounds had an effect on PLP's known enzymatic activities. We hypothesize that this compound is either affecting an unidentified activity of PLP or that it acts at the level of a cellular protein that modifies or bypasses the function of PLP in cells. Given that NSC158362 is functional not only in yeast but also in mammalian cells, it is very likely that the target of this compound is PLP itself or a cellular protein that is highly conserved from yeast to humans.",

Use of the yeast based screen to identify antivirals is rapid and efficient, both important aspects when dealing with newly emerging infectious diseases. Since knowledge of the function of the viral protein is not required in order to perform this type of small molecule screen, it can be scaled to any size virus and rapidly initiated once the viral sequence is known of a pathogen, potentially leading to the direct identification of lead compounds for further adaptation and testing in vivo.\n",

It was derived by tetrad dissection from two parent strains that had been modified by one step gene replacements. The pdr1::KanMX4 was constructed in BY4741 (MATa his3\u03941 leu2\u03940 met15\u03940 ura3\u03940) and the pdr3:KanMX4 was constructed in BY4742 (MAT\u03b1 his3\u03941 leu2\u03940 met15\u03940 ura3\u03940). PCR-mediated one-step gene replacements, matings and tetrad dissections were performed as described[22]. Strains 9526-6-2-pRS416 and 9526-6-2/pRS416/PLP/HA were generated by transformation of 9526-6-2 with plasmids pRS416 and pRS416/PLP/HA, respectively, and were maintained on synthetic complete medium (SC) lacking uracil. For growth experiments and library screening, a single transformed colony was grown overnight and the cell number determined using a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter Corporation). The cells were diluted to 5\u00d7105 cells/ml in SC lacking uracil and containing 2% raffinose and 2% galactose. 95 \u00b5l of this culture was added to 5 \u00b5l of pre-plated test compounds in 96-well plates such that the final drug concentration was 50 \u00b5M and the final DMSO concentration was 1%. The Diversity Set library (National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program) was used for the drug screen. It was provided as 10 mM stocks in 100% DMSO. OD600 readings were taken every 12 hours for 60 hours using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).",
