The \u201cshould\u2010do\u201d behavior has been well documented in both Chinese and Western literature. For instance, Kuan\u2010tzu said \u201cno one can resist advantages or will embrace disadvantage voluntarily (Kuan\u2010tzu, 740\u2010645 BC, p.1074\u20131075).\u201d In The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, Adam Smith famously argued that economic behavior was motivated by self\u2010interest (Ashraf, Camerer, & Loewenstein, 2005).",

There is a family drama TV series entitled Suffering a Loss is Good Fortune, directed by He Qun, and an American comedy\u2010drama film Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You, directed by Roberto Faenza and based on Peter Cameron's novel of the same name, it is translated into Chinese as \u201c\u5403\u4e8f\u662f\u798f\u201d (Chikui shi fu).",

That is, a single option (Option yi) that results in loss can be presented as a unique point by the decision maker in a one\u2010dimensional or in multidimensional space.

Moreover, \u201cChikui\u201d (taking Option yi) seems to contradict the conventional view of loss aversion, which is commonly interpreted as the (marginal) disutility of a given loss being larger than the (marginal) utility of the same amount of gain (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Considering that the existing decision theory sees \u201cmaximizing gains\u201d or \u201cminimizing losses\u201d as its basic principle, those theories will not predict or explain \u201cChikui\u201d (suffer a loss) as a choice we want to make. As thus, conventional decision theory does not account for a \u201cChikui\u201d choice above and beyond the law of the jungle, which is \u201cachieving rewards and avoiding punishments.\u201d In other words, the incremental contribution that conventional decision theory makes to explain why the offered loss is frequently selected by ordinary people is limited.",

The Chinese version of the Social Dominance Orientation Scale (SDO) measured social and political attitudes using a 14\u2010item scale (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994). Mean scores were calculated from responses to a 7\u2010point Likert scale. In addition, fixed\u2010sequence choice titration was measured, and the degree of discounting was calculated by application of the hyperbolic equation (Hardisty & Weber, 2009; Mazur, 1987). As in Part 1 of this study, the CLS was measured, and participants then answered questions about whether they were volunteers and their willingness to have more than one child. Participants also reported their gender, age, and academic performance (e.g., GPA) in the latest tests.",

(2014). In Part 2, we sought to examine the criterion\u2010related validity of the CLS by assessing its relationship with participants' choice behavior in the UG, DG, and intertemporal choice rather than existing scales (Table 6). We found that the CLS correlated significantly with willingness to accept unfair allocations in the UG (r = 0.20, p < 0.01). The result suggested that individuals who were more willing to choose \u201cChikui\u201d (suffering a loss) would be more likely to accept an unfair offer, which supported the criterion\u2010related validity of the CLS. However, the CLS was not correlated with allocating more money to the recipient in the DG (r = 0.07, p = 0.21). This finding, together with the correlations of CLS's subscale and the DG reported in Table 6, suggested that what is measured by allocating more money in the DG is decision makers' altruism and that the threshold of unfairness measured by willingness to accept unfair allocations in the UG was more related to \u201cChikui\u201d than to altruism. Furthermore, CLS scores were not correlated with the degree of discounting in intertemporal choice. This may be because, in order to reach a decision, decision makers must only assess the outcomes of a pair of offered intertemporal options (\u201csmall but sooner\u201d and \u201clarge but later\u201d) on the fixed dimensions, while they have to generate a new dimension and assign a delayed subjective value (utility) to the single option of \u201cChikui.\u201d",
