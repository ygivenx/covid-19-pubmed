Mutations impairing the ability to stimulate IFN secretion or to recognize and adequately respond to IFNs have drastic consequences in terms of exaggerated pathogen susceptibility and increased tumor frequencies. Mice harboring targeted mutations in central components of the IFN system succumb to experimental infections with various pathogens even at very low doses of infection (sometimes in the range of the respective detection limit or even below), while wild-type animals easily survive infections with high numbers of the same pathogen (1, 2). Human individuals suffering from similar mutations have been identified\u2014often due to overt morbidity and mortality after infection with attenuated live vaccine viruses or otherwise mild and/or opportunistic agents (3). The importance of IFNs in control of tumors is evident from the findings that mice lacking functional IFN systems are more prone to spontaneous tumor development and increased tumor burden in experimental models (4\u20136) as well as from the fact that loss-of-function mutations become enriched in genes coding for central mediators of the IFN system during tumor development (e.g., in the case of melanoma) (7, 8) indicating a pronounced selection pressure elicited by the IFN system.",

Upon binding of the IFN-I to their cognate receptor complex, the Janus kinases phosphorylate the intracellular domains of the receptor chains thereby generating binding sites for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2. After the STATs bound the receptors, they become phosphorylated by Tyk2 and Jak1 at a specific tyrosine residue located around amino acid position 700 (Y701 in the case of STAT1). Due to intramolecular interactions between the phosphorylated tyrosine residue of one STAT molecule with the src homology 2 domain of the second STAT molecule and vice versa, an active heterodimer forms. Previous models often implied a de novo interaction of monomeric STAT proteins upon phosphorylation, whereas recent work argues in favor of preformed STAT dimers (10, 11) which change their conformation and orientation upon activation (12\u201314). Together with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), STAT1, and STAT2 form active heterotrimers called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) which translocate into the nucleus, bind to specific DNA enhancer elements [called IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs)] and induce the expression of adjacent genes. The binding and recognition of DNA is mediated by both STATs and the IRF9 molecule. Consistently, the central part of the ISRE consensus resembles an IRF DNA binding site (also called IRF-E site) (15).",

Beneath this receptor proximal signaling events, cross-talk can also be induced down-stream by induction of a second layer of transcription factors (e.g., IRFs): IFN\u03b3 strongly induces IRF1 which in turn can enhance genes harboring IRF-E sites. Since the central part of ISRE elements resembles an IRF-E site, IFN\u03b3 can stimulate several IFN-I responsive genes indirectly via IRFs like IRF1. Given these descriptions of overlap and crosstalk between the signaling cascades, it is surprising that both cytokines are thought to induce different biological responses: IFN-I (and IFN-III) are believed to induce a direct antiviral activity, whereas IFN\u03b3 is mainly considered as stimulator of adaptive immune responses (e.g., by enhancing antigen presentation).",

After 4 h of IFN exposure, IFN\u03b1 treatment led to a higher number of proteins being upregulated when compared with IFN\u03b3 (45 versus 27 proteins). In clear contrast, after 24 and 48 h, the number of upregulated proteins is five to eight times higher in the case of IFN\u03b3 (55 versus 436 at 24 h). We also observed several proteins which were significantly downregulated. In this respect, the difference between IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 was even more pronounced, since such protein regulations were clearly more prominent upon IFN\u03b3 treatment. Functional annotations of all proteins being significantly and at least twofold regulated by IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 were performed for each investigated time point. The obtained results display a broad spectrum of associated molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components (see Figures S2\u2013S4 in Supplementary Material). As expected, for both IFN types, IFN signaling (and several related or similar gene ontologies called, e.g., \u201cdefense response to virus\u201d) was found as a highly enriched biological process among the upregulated proteins. Additionally, several biological processes associated with antigen presentation via MHC-I were found to be enriched among proteins induced by both IFNs after prolonged exposure. In the particular case of IFN\u03b3, the obtained results furthermore indicate, that a broad spectrum of diverse biological processes are altered. This is in line with the expectations based on the tremendously higher number of proteins being regulated by IFN\u03b3 when compared with IFN\u03b1. In addition, the dynamic nature of cellular proteome modulations is nicely demonstrated by the enrichment of particular biological processes among up- and downregulated proteins at various time points. For example, different translational processes were found highly enriched among IFN\u03b3-repressed proteins at 24 h, whereas the same processes were enriched in the IFN\u03b3-induced group of proteins at 48 h (see Supplementary Material).",

Depending on the nature of the respective pathogen, prominent discrepancies concerning the direct antiviral activity have been documented [e.g., (38)]. According to an oversimplified textbook concept, IFN\u03b1 acts directly antiviral (e.g., by inducing effector proteins such as Mx, PKR, and OAS), whereas IFN\u03b3 modulates adaptive immune responses for example by stimulating MHC expression. Such differences should be reflected by non-overlapping changes in the proteome. Therefore, IFN type-specific complementarities were analyzed on qualitative level to elucidate to which extent both IFNs regulate common as well as distinct sets of proteins. To this end, lists of proteins exhibiting significant at least twofold up- and downregulations after treatment with IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3, respectively, were compared for each time point of analysis. The results are shown in Figure 2A. After a short incubation time of 4 h, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 had only 10 upregulated and 26 repressed proteins in common. However, 17 and 35 proteins were exclusively upregulated by IFN\u03b3 and IFN\u03b1, respectively. Similarly, 75 proteins were only repressed by IFN\u03b3 and 11 proteins only by IFN\u03b1 after 4 h of treatment. At later time points, the majority of proteins being IFN\u03b1 responsive were also responsive to IFN\u03b3. On top of these commonly responsive proteins, IFN\u03b3 was capable to specifically upregulate additional proteins (393 and 267) after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Concerning downregulated proteins, this trend was even more pronounced: after 24 and 48 h, only 2 and 1 protein, respectively, were significantly and at least twofold repressed by IFN\u03b1, whereas IFN\u03b3 also repressed these proteins plus 185 and 110 additional proteins, respectively (Figure 2A).",

With only few exceptions, most proteins being specifically regulated at least twofold by one IFN type exhibit a consistent and significant trend upon treatment with the other IFN. However, in the latter case, fold change criteria are often not fulfilled. Regarding the strength of regulations, at 4 h posttreatment the slope of the regression line (~1) indicates that both IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 have comparable inductive or repressive effects. As indicated by slopes above 1, at 24 and 48 h, protein regulations induced by IFN\u03b3 are more pronounced than the corresponding regulations by IFN\u03b1.",

The results of these accession-based comparisons are depicted as Venn diagrams in Figure 3A. In the case of both IFNs, proteome alterations are found to be highly dynamic as indicated by distinct complementarities between the investigated time points. For IFN\u03b1, 169 proteins were found to be significantly regulated at least at one of the three investigated time points. Of these, only 2, 5, and 18 proteins were regulated at two time points and only 5 at each time point after IFN\u03b1 treatment. A closer inspection of these proteins (Figure 3B) revealed common regulation directions throughout the investigated time period, except contrary regulations of five proteins being significantly regulated at 4 and 24 h. Conversely, 70, 29, and 40 proteins were only differentially regulated at one particular time point. In the case of IFN\u03b3, of 936 significantly at least twofold regulated proteins, 17, 44, and 135 proteins were regulated at two and 26 at all three time points. Forty-one, 418, and 255 proteins were only regulated by IFN\u03b3 at one particular time point. Interestingly, except IFIT3, all proteins found in the overlaps with the 4 h samples show inverted regulation profiles at one or both of the two other time points. Contrarily, of 135 proteins commonly altered after 24 and 48 h, 127 exhibit the same regulation direction (Figure 3B lower panel). Taken together, these data reveal an extraordinary dynamic and turnover of IFN-induced changes and highlight the necessity to perform such experiments in a time-resolved manner\u2014otherwise considerable changes might be missed or at least severely underestimated.",

            "text": "Nucleated cells continuously present a snapshot of their current protein expression profile in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules to circulating T lymphocytes (see Figure 4A for an overview). Especially IFN\u03b3 is well known for its effect on several proteins implicated in antigen presentation. The proteasome and other proteases degrade proteins to peptides which are transferred into the lumen of the ER by the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). Via TabBP (also called Tapasin), TAP is associated with HLA molecules, composed of the HLA heavy chain and \u03b22m. The loading of peptides onto HLA/MHC molecules as well as the quality control are catalyzed by several chaperons (e.g., ERp57, calreticulin, calnexin). Increased expression of several genes involved in antigen presentation induced by IFN\u03b3 is well described. Additionally, IFN\u03b3 induces a change in the composition of the proteasome from the constitutive proteasome to the so called immune proteasome by stimulating an exchange of three subunits (PSMB5, 6, and 7) by three alternative subunits [namely PSBM8 (LMP7), 9 (LMP2), and 10 (MECL1)]. Based on the proteome data, we exemplarily compared the regulation of proteins implicated in HLA presentation after IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 treatment. Consistent with previous reports about MRC-5 cells (39), our proteome analysis identified and quantified HLA proteins corresponding to HLA-A2, -A29, and B44 alleles. Although IFN\u03b3 was superior in inducing the components of antigen presentation, IFN\u03b1 also enhanced the abundance of several proteins (e.g., HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, PSBM9, TAP1, and TAP2) (Figure 4B). Consistent with this IFN\u03b1 responsiveness of important components of the HLA/MHC presentation pathway, a flow cytometry experiment using the HLA-specific antibody W6/32 showed an upregulation of HLA presentation on the cell surface of IFN\u03b1- and IFN\u03b3-treated cells (Figure 4C) validating our proteome data on biological level.",

Antiviral activity is executed by a multitude of effector proteins. Thus, the discrepancy in efficacy against different agents must also be reflected in the differential expression of the relevant restriction factors. Based on the global data set, we chose prototypic examples of IFN-responsive proteins with documented antipathogenic activity to highlight that certain proteins are similarly responsive to both IFNs, whereas other are either more IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 inducible. Although some classical antiviral genes such as Mx1 and PKR responded more to IFN\u03b1, considerable induction became also evident upon IFN\u03b3 treatment (Figure 5, left panel). A second set of proteins with previously shown antiviral activity against viruses such as HIV and influenza [e.g., BST2/Tetherin, SAMHD1, and IFIT3 (40\u201342)] were similarly responsive to both IFNs (Figure 5, middle panel). Most interestingly, a third class of proteins which was more or even almost exclusively responsive to IFN\u03b3 contained proteins such as IDO, GBP5, and PML (Figure 5, right panel) which are known to confer antiviral activity (43\u201345).",

Similarly, MS-based determinations rely on different peptides with non-overlapping characteristics during identification and quantification. For our analysis, we used saturating IFN concentrations. Depending on the ISG and IRepG subsets, we observed pronounced responses either to IFN\u03b1 (see Figure 5, left panel), to IFN\u03b3 (Figure 5, right panel) or both IFNs (Figure 5, central panel) indicating the perceptiveness of the cells.

            "text": "Our previous transcriptional analysis in murine cells revealed the existence of an extended set of IRepGs in mouse fibroblasts and macrophages (22). IRepG responses constitute a primary transcriptional response resistant to the blockade of translation by cycloheximide. An alignment of IRepGs and their promoters/enhancers did not result in an enrichment of GAS or ISRE elements but instead uncovered an accumulation of GC-rich elements and corresponding SP1/SP3 binding sites (22). This was consistent with previously described SP1/SP3 dependency of individual genes shown to be repressed by IFN\u03b3 (52). Despite the lack of ISRE and GAS sequences, IRepG repression was largely lost in STAT1-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that gene repression by IFN\u03b3 is a mostly neglected ability of its \u201csignature\u201d transcription factor STAT1. The data immediately raised two important questions: (I) Do IRepGs exist in other species and especially in cells of human origin and (II) does IFN\u03b3-induced transcriptional gene repression translate into reduced abundance of proteins? This study provides answers to both questions: we observed a surprisingly large number of proteins being negatively regulated by IFN and especially type II IFN in human cells: after 4 h of treatment, the number of IFN\u03b3-repressed proteins even exceeded the number of induced proteins. At 24 and 48 h post treatment, approximately two ISG proteins face one IRepG protein. The top hits of our global analysis include proteins such as collagen \u03b11 and 2 for which individual experiments have documented repression by IFN\u03b3 (53, 54) further validating our data set in regard to the IRepGs.",

It is not difficult to imagine that the IFN-induced downregulation of proteins which are required for the replication of certain pathogens or tumors might have benefits for the host\u2014simply by withholding essential cofactors, e.g., the entry receptor of an intracellular pathogen to prevent its infection. Viruses also rely on numerous intracellular factors and metabolic capabilities of the host cell to allow their own replication. One unifying feature of viruses is their lack of ribosomes and thus their inability to translate proteins outside of host cells. Consistently, the translational machinery is one major battleground between pathogens and host, and several ISGs (e.g., PKR, ISG54, and ISG56) target translation [reviewed in Ref. (55)]. A downregulation of proteins required for translation (or other essential metabolic pathways such as ATP synthesis) might limit the replication of pathogens. Consistently, we observed that, e.g., eIF2A, eIF3M, and others were repressed by IFN\u03b3 (see Data Sheet S1 in Supplementary Material). Thus, it seems that IRepGs contribute to the restriction of the translational machinery. The seemingly suicidal aspect of such repression might be overcome by strictly controlled (down-)regulation by IFNs upon infection.",

One protein which was downregulated is fatty acid synthase FASN (protein ID P49327, Figure 6B). From different studies, FASN is known to be required for the replication of hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza 3 (PIV3), astrovirus, and rhinovirus replication (56\u201360). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that suppression of FASN by IFN\u03b3 might reduce the replication of such viruses. Another example is the protein Ergic53 which is required for the replication of Arena, Corona, and Filoviruses (61), and which we found to be repressed by IFN\u03b3. Functional studies on IRepGs are definitely needed, but a comparison of herein found IRepGs with genes found in at least two of the three published siRNA screens to be required for HIV replication (62) indicate that the family of IRepGs also comprises additional genes required for HIV replication (e.g., IDH1).",

It is well known that IFNs limit their own signaling by stimulating potent mediators of negative feedback loops (e.g., IFN-induced expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling and protein inhibitor of activated STATs). We hypothesize that IRepGs might be weakly IFN responsive but fully responsive to the effects of the negative feedback cascade. We infer that the responsible proteins should be (I) repressors of transcription, (II) IFN-inducible, and (III) able to \u201cidentify\u201d IRepGs. Beside SP1 and SP3, three promising candidates for such mechanisms are IRF-2, PRDM1, and Bcl6. All three proteins bind to DNA and repress transcription (64\u201367), all are induced by IFN and recognize ISRE, IRF-E, GAS, or similar DNA elements (30, 65, 68, 69).",
