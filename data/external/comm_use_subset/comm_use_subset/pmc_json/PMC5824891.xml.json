Hence, disruption of endolysosome function is found in a wide range of diseases, from genetic lysosomal storage disorders to cancer and neurodegenerative disorders1\u20133. The progression of cargo through the endolysosomal system, from early endosomes (EEs) to late endosomes and lysosomes or from EEs to the plasma membrane or recycling endosomes (REs), is tightly controlled by dedicated protein machinery. Membrane fusion is coordinated by the concerted action of Rab GTPases, tethers and soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs)4,5. Rab GTPases drive the process by recruiting effector machinery proteins to specific membrane domains6,7. Contact between opposing membranes is then initiated by tethering proteins, followed by SNARE-mediated fusion.",

The hexameric CORVET complex consists of a core (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18 and Vps33A), which is shared with the late endosomal homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, and additionally contains the two CORVET-specific subunits Vps8 and Vps3 (also named TGFBRAP1 or TRAP1)9,12. Recycling of endocytosed proteins and membranes from EEs is crucial to maintain plasma membrane homeostasis and is essential for cell polarity, cell migration and cytokinesis. Recycling occurs either directly from EEs to the plasma membrane (fast recycling) or indirectly via Rab11-positive REs (slow recycling)13\u201315. Both pathways involve Rab4, which resides on EEs as well as on recycling vesicles that emerge from EEs15\u201317. The class C homologues in endosome-vesicle interaction (CHEVI) complex consisting of Vps33B and VIPAS39, homologues of Vps33A and Vps16, respectively, binds to Rab11 and localises to REs18\u201320. Mutations in Vps33B or VIPAS39 underlie arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder that affects the transport of apical and junctional proteins in polarised cells18,19,21.",

To our surprise we found that the CORVET-specific Vps3 and Vps8 subunits interact directly with each other and localise to Rab4-positive recycling vesicles and CHEVI-positive REs. Moreover, we show that Vps3 and Vps8 function in a specialised pathway required for integrin recycling, and thereby regulates integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration.",

We expressed GFP-Vps3 and HA-Vps8 in HeLa cells and performed immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) by immunogold labelling of ultrathin cryosections. Our IEM data confirmed the localisation of Vps3 and Vps8 on EEs (Fig. 1a, top panel), but in addition revealed a substantial labelling on EE-associated tubules and vesicles (Fig. 1a, bottom panel). The Vps3- and Vps8-labelled vesicles had a characteristic dense content, were often found in clusters (Fig. 1a, lower panel, and 1b) and were consistently negative for endocytosed BSA-Au5, a marker of endocytic but not recycling vesicles. These morphological characteristics putatively define the Vps3- and Vps8-positive vesicles as recycling vesicles.",

Immunogold double labelling showed that Vps18 co-localises with Vps3 on EEs, but was absent from Vps3-positive vesicles (Fig. 1b, asterisks), indicating that Vps3 and Vps8 localise to recycling vesicles, which lack CORVET core components. We then co-expressed GFP-Vps3, HA-Vps8 or the CORVET core subunit GFP-Vps11, together with mCherry-tagged Rab4, Rab5 or Rab11, and assessed their co-localisation by quantitative immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. We found that Vps3 (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1a) and Vps8 (Fig. 1c, d) significantly co-localised with Rab5 and Rab4, which label EEs and EE-derived recycling vesicles, respectively17,22, and partially with the RE marker Rab11 (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1a), indicative for the presence of Vps3 and Vps8 on EEs as well as on recycling vesicles. By contrast, GFP-Vps11 only notably overlapped with Rab5 (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b), reinforcing the notion that CORVET core components are present on EEs but not on recycling vesicles. To facilitate the distinction of Rab5 and Rab4 subdomains within EEs by IF microscopy, we expressed the constitutively active Rab5Q79L mutant, which increases the size of EEs22,23. Strikingly, co-expression of GFP-Rab5Q79L with HA-Vps8 and FLAG-Rab4 revealed that HA-Vps8 specifically concentrated in FLAG-Rab4-positive patches (Fig. 1e, arrows) and protrusions (Supplementary Fig. 1c, arrows) of GFP-Rab5Q79L-positive EEs. To further confirm that Vps3 and Vps8 reside on the same recycling vesicles as Rab4 we performed IEM of HeLa cells expressing HA-Vps8 or HA-Vps3 with GFP-Rab4. This unequivocally demonstrated that Vps3 and Vps8 indeed co-localise with Rab4 on recycling tubules and vesicles (Fig. 1f, arrows).",

Since we find that Vps3 and Vps8 co-localise on recycling vesicles that lack CORVET core components, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-binding experiments to investigate whether mammalian Vps3 and Vps8 bind directly to each other. In agreement with this scenario, co-IP experiments in HeLa cells revealed that endogenous Vps8 readily co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed GFP-Vps3, while less Vps8 was recovered with GFP-tagged Vps11, Vps16 or Vps41, the HOPS-specific subunit that is most homologous to Vps8 (Fig. 2a, full blots in Supplementary Fig. 2). To investigate whether Vps3 can directly bind Vps8 we probed the binding of full-length GST-Vps3 purified from bacterial lysates with in vitro-translated HA-Vps8. Importantly, GST-Vps3 interacted directly with HA-Vps8 (Fig. 2b, full blots in Supplementary Fig. 3). By expressing truncation mutants of GST-Vps3, we could map the Vps8 interacting domain to the C terminus of Vps3 (Fig. 2b), which also confirms the specificity of the binding assays. Finally, to quantify the interaction of Vps3 with Vps8, Vps11 or Vps16 we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) in HeLa cells. This showed a significantly higher PLA signal between Vps3 and Vps8, than between Vps3 and Vps11 or Vps16 (Fig. 2c, d).",

Because co-expression of Vps33B together with VIPAS39 is needed for membrane recruitment of the CHEVI complex18,19, we included an internal control by probing the interactions with HA-VIPAS39 in the absence (Fig. 3d, left panel) or presence (Fig. 3d, right panel) of overexpressed HA-Vps33B. As expected, we detected a strong interaction between HA-VIPAS39 and GFP-Vps33B (Fig. 3d, lane 7 both panels, full blots in Supplementary Fig. 4). Strikingly, however, no significant binding between CHEVI with any of the other subunits was found (Fig. 3d). Only after prolonged exposure of the western blot a weak interaction between GFP-Vps3 and HA-VIPAS39 was detected (Supplementary Fig. 5 and 6). Previous studies using endogenous proteins failed to detect specific interactions between VIPAS39 with any of the HOPS or CORVET subunits, including Vps3 and Vps88,9. Our studies are in line with these findings, however, the weak binding between CHEVI and Vps3 could be indicative for transient interactions.",

To study a potential role of Vps3 and Vps8 in the recycling of \u03b21 integrins we used an established antibody-based integrin recycling assay34. HeLa cells were depleted of Vps3 and Vps8, and then serum-starved overnight, labelled with anti-\u03b21 integrin, washed and chased for 2 h. In the absence of serum, \u03b21 integrins accumulate in REs (Fig. 4c, arrows). Vps3/8 knockdown prevented the accumulation of \u03b21 integrins, which instead retained a dispersed distribution throughout the cell (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7). Using an adapted IEM protocol to visualise the antibody uptake as described above, we could identify the accumulations in control cells as large clusters of recycling tubules and vesicles (Fig. 4d, left panel). Importantly, IEM of the Vps3/8 knockdown cells showed that internalised \u03b21 integrins still entered EEs and EE-associated recycling vesicles (Fig. 4d, right panel). These data show that the block in \u03b21 integrin recycling induced by Vps3/8 knockdown occurs after exit from EEs, and interferes with the transport of recycling vesicles to REs. Re-addition of serum induced integrin recycling in control cells resulting in the disappearance of intracellular accumulations, while the localisation of internalised \u03b21 integrins in knockdown cells remained unchanged (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 7). Together these results imply that Vps3/8 knockdown prevents or delays internalised \u03b21 integrins to reach REs and thereby prevents clearance of the intracellular pool.",

Surface biotin was removed and recycling was induced by re-addition of serum. Surface biotin was removed again and the reduction of intracellular biotinylated \u03b15 integrin before and after recycling was quantified using capture ELISA. This assay showed that knockdown of Vps3/8 resulted in a significant decrease of \u03b15\u03b21 recycling, especially after short recycling times (Fig. 4f), while the internalisation of \u03b15\u03b21 as not affected (Fig. 4g). Finally, to verify that \u03b15\u03b21 is indeed transported by Vps3/8-positive recycling vesicles, we labelled the \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrin subunits for IEM.

Non-adherent cells were washed away after 5, 15 or 30 min, and the number of attached cells was quantified. This revealed that adhesion to both FN (Fig. 5a) and Col-I (Fig. 5b) was significantly compromised in Vps3/8 knockdown cells. Individual knockdown of Vps3 or Vps8 also reduced cell adhesion, but the effect was less stringent, suggesting that residual expression in single-knockdown cells still allows a functional interaction between Vps3 and Vps8, while in the double-knockdown cells this is more completely abrogated (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Importantly, different siRNA oligos induced essentially the same results, rendering it unlikely that the observed adhesion defect is due to off-target effects (Supplementary Fig. 8b).",

To determine if Vps3/8 knockdown impacts on FA formation, we quantified the number of FAs per cell using confocal microscopy on cell populations stained for vinculin, a well-established marker of FAs (Fig. 5e).

In addition, we find Vps3/8 on Rab11-positive REs. By co-IP and assays using purified proteins we show strong interactions between Vps3 and Vps8, demonstrating that they can interact directly with each other. In addition, we show by IEM that Vps3 and Vps8 co-localise with the CHEVI complex on REs. Based on our data we propose that Vps3 and Vps8 are recruited to EEs together with CORVET core components, after which they localise to Rab4-positive recycling vesicles, which set out to fuse with Rab11- and CHEVI-positive REs (Fig. 6). The Vps3/Vps8-dependent recycling pathway is required for efficient recycling of internalised \u03b21 integrins, and perturbation of Vps3 or Vps8 impairs integrin-dependent cell adhesion and spreading, FA assembly and cell migration.",

Since Vps3/8 knockdown prevents delivery of \u03b21 integrins to REs (Fig. 4c, f), we conclude that Vps3 and Vps8 are involved in transport from EEs to REs (Fig. 6). Our finding that Vps3 and Vps8 interact with each other (Fig. 2) and localise to recycling vesicles that lack the CORVET core subunit Vps18 (Fig. 1) could indicate the formation of a Vps3/8 complex independently of the CORVET core subunits. A direct interaction between Vps3 and Vps8 has been found before8, but seemed counterintuitive since in the current CORVET model Vps3 and Vps8 are located at opposite ends of the complex45. The formation of a Vps3/8 complex without other CORVET core components would provide a functional and structural explanation for these findings. Interestingly, Vps39 and Vps41, the counterparts of Vps3 and Vps8 residing on the opposite ends of the HOPS complex, can also directly interact with each other24, possibly by obtaining a closed post-fusion conformation of HOPS following late endosome-lysosome fusion45,46. In analogy herewith, a closed post EE-EE fusion conformation of the CORVET complex could precede the direct interaction of Vps3 and Vps8. Future studies on endogenous proteins are however required to determine if there is indeed a functional Vps3/8 complex formed and whether this requires the presence of additional proteins.",

            "text": "As a crucial mechanism to control integrin function, endocytic recycling of integrins is a topic of extensive research39,47\u201349. Integrins use multiple recycling pathways depending on heterodimer composition, conformation (active or inactive) and ligand binding. A key question is how sorting to these different pathways is achieved. Interestingly, we found that Vps3/8 knockdown had no effect on Tf recycling (Fig. 4a, b). Tf recycling depends on Rab4 and Rab11, which are also involved in integrin recycling13,30,34,38,50. However, in contrast to Tf, recycling of \u03b21 integrins depends on a NPxY motif that in EEs binds SNX17 or SNX31 to sort integrins into recycling vesicles51\u201353. This suggests that within the Rab4/Rab11 pathway multiple sub-pathways exist. Recently, a new protein complex, retriever, has been identified that associates with SNX17 on EEs and sorts \u03b15\u03b21 integrin from the early endosome to the recycling pathway54. Retriever is therefore a likely candidate to mediate sorting of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin into the Vps3/8 recycling pathway. Together these data suggest that the interplay between CORVET, retriever, CHEVI and a possible Vps3/8 complex is important for integrin recycling. In analogy with the concept of EE-associated tubular sorting endosomes or networks, machinery proteins involved in cargo sorting might define subdomains on REs27,55,56. At the level of REs, the CHEVI protein Vps33B is a putative candidate to define exits specialised for integrin recycling, since it interacts directly with integrin \u03b2-subunits57. Future studies are required to define additional cargo for the retriever-Vps3/8-CHEVI-dependent recycling pathway.",

After 2 h uptake at 37 \u00b0C, followed by fixation and labelling with fluorescent secondary antibodies, \u03b21 integrin accumulation in REs (arrows) was visualised by IF. In knockdown cells, no accumulation of integrin was found, indicating that the trafficking to REs is blocked. d IEM of cells subjected to the integrin uptake assay as in c and immunogold-labelled for endocytosed anti-\u03b21 integrin (10 nm gold). Accumulations of endocytosed \u03b21 integrin are by IEM identified as a cluster of tubular membranes (left panel, cluster accented by white dashed line, inset shows magnification of membrane tubules).
