No vaccines are available for human use and, though licensed veterinary vaccines are available, these have major drawbacks that limit their use.13 For instance, the Smithburn vaccine is a highly efficacious live-attenuated RVFV vaccine but is contraindicated in gestating animals as it can result in abortion and foetal malformations.13\u201315 Clone 13, another commercially available livestock vaccine, is based on a naturally attenuated RVFV strain that bears a large deletion in the NSs protein, the main RVFV virulence factor.16,17 Whilst Clone 13 is safe and protective after a single dose, an overdose study has shown that Clone 13 can traverse the placental barrier causing foetal malformations and stillbirths.18 Formalin-inactivated RVF vaccines can be applied safely during pregnancy but require multiple boosters for optimal efficacy, thus complicating their use in outbreak situations.13,19 For humans, only two vaccines have been evaluated in clinical trials: MP-12 and TSI-GSD-200.20\u201322 Both have a good safety profile in humans but MP-12 has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock,23 and TSI-GSD-200 requires multiple doses for optimal efficacy.20 For these reasons, there is an urgent need for vaccines that provide protection after a single vaccination in animals and/or humans and that can be applied safely during pregnancy.",

ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated animals had a slight elevation in temperature of ~0.4 \u00b0C in ewes and 0.5 \u00b0C in does within 24 h of vaccination. This temperature rise reached statistical significance when compared to baseline (Mann\u2013Whitney U test p < 0.05 for both species) but had normalized by day 2 post-vaccination. One ewe in the mock-vaccinated group developed laryngeal chondritis (\u201cTexel throat\u201d) unrelated to the study and had to be euthanised 10 days post-vaccination. No other animals showed clinical signs in the 3-week follow-up period before challenge, indicating that the ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine is safe during pregnancy in these livestock species.",

The challenge virus dose was back titrated at 105.26 TCID50. Within 3 days after RVFV challenge, mock-vaccinated ewes had elevated rectal temperatures that coincided with a loss of appetite and high levels of viraemia (Figs 2a, g, 3). One ewe died acutely 5 days post-challenge and had a typical necrotic liver and two dead foetuses on necropsy (Supplementary Table 1). Another ewe aborted one foetus 7 days post-challenge together with an autolysed placenta (Supplementary Table 1). At this point, all remaining ewes in this group were euthanised to prevent unnecessary animal discomfort. In total, the mock-vaccinated group carried 14 foetuses, which were all found dead on necropsy (Supplementary Table 1). Viral RNA and infectious virus were detected in maternal livers and spleens and in foetal liver, brain, spleen and placentomes (Fig. 3). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of placentomes from mock-vaccinated ewes revealed extensive haemorrhages and areas of necrosis on the maternal epithelium, with foci of mineralization (Fig. 4a, e, right column). RVFV-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the presence of RVFV antigen in both maternal and foetal epithelial cells (Fig. 4b, f right column) and Alizarin Red staining confirmed the presence of calcium deposits (Fig. 4c, d, right column).",

The remaining does (n = 6) were all euthanised on day 11 post-challenge to prevent unnecessary discomfort. At necropsy, three of the six does were found not to carry foetuses. These does were likely pseudo-pregnant, as confirmed retrospectively by low levels of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins measured by ELISA. All the foetuses in the three remaining pregnant does were dead and autolysed on necropsy (Supplementary Table 2). High viral RNA levels were detected in both maternal and foetal tissues (Fig. 3), but virus could only be isolated, almost exclusively, in the placentomes due to the autolysed status of the foetuses at necropsy (Fig. 3). IHC staining of the placentomes revealed strong staining for RVFV antigen, with large areas of necrotic maternal epithelium and mineralizations observed by H&E and Alizarin Red staining (Fig. 5, right column).

This was despite the fact that vaccination was performed in the first trimester when the foetus is most susceptible to abortion or malformations following vaccination with current licensed veterinary vaccines.23 As expected from previous studies in sheep and goats, all ChAdOx1 RVF vaccinees developed high titre RVFV nAbs and these could be detected as early as 7 days post-vaccination.33 As ChAdOx1 RVF does not contain the RVFV nucleoprotein (N), which is present in whole RVFV and widely used in diagnostic ELISAs,37 detection of anti-N antibodies can be used to distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA). Indeed, all mock-vaccinated animals developed an anti-N antibody response following challenge with RVFV, whilst ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated ewes were fully protected from foetal loss and viraemia and did not develop anti-N antibodies. Some of the ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated does did develop anti-N antibodies despite the absence of detectable viraemia, suggesting virus replication was not completely blocked. The rapid induction of protective nAbs and together with DIVA compatibility make ChAdOx1 RVF well-suited for response to outbreaks.",

This was despite having an RVFV nAb titre that was on average five times higher than that in sheep on the day of viral challenge. This is remarkable, as the ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine-induced immune response was clearly sufficient to prevent maternal viraemia and clinical signs in this study, and in non-pregnant goats in our previous studies in Kenya.33",

Future studies will help address this conclusively. Such analyses should include correlations between gestational outcomes and challenge virus dose, route of viral exposure, the quality of the humoral and cellular immune response, goat breed and other putative host factors. Non-pregnant goats do indeed show variability in the natural course of RVFV infection depending upon the breed of goat, age, the challenge strain and the route of inoculation.38\u201340 Viral RNA following RVFV challenge has been detected at 28 days post-challenge in non-pregnant goats,40 and in spleens of calves and sheep up to 20 days post-challenge, suggesting that animals recovering from RVFV infection may harbour low virus levels in tissues for extended periods. Given that RVFV has tropism for placental tissue, the finding of viral RNA in the placentomes at 23/24 days post-challenge in this study is therefore not surprising.",

These mineralizations were not due to ChAdOx1 RVF vaccination as they were also found in mock-vaccinated ewes and goats and bore no clinical significance. The foci were relatively small compared to the total area of the placentome. Such mineralizations have not been described previously in any of the virulent RVFV challenge studies done in pregnant animals,41,42 though the viral challenge in these studies was done later in gestation (second trimester) and vaccinated animals were followed to full term following challenge. The most likely explanation is that the mineralizations were an indicator of inflammation following viral infection as noted for other infectious diseases in animals and humans.43\u201345 The high intravenous challenge dose used in this study would have ensured rapid dissemination of the virus to the placenta and others tissues that RVFV has tropism for, thus initiating a strong host inflammatory response. It is plausible that an alternative inoculation route (e.g. subcutaneous or intranasal or mosquito bite) may have resulted in a slower rate of placental infection with minimal histological evidence of inflammation.40 Alternatively, the mineralizations may have been incidental, as occurs during the latter stages of gestation in humans46,47 and livestock45,48 though its impact on placental physiology is unknown. Future vaccination studies, using different viral challenge routes at different stages of gestation and following pregnancy to full term, will be useful in fully characterizing incidental, transient and irreversible features of placental RVFV infection in livestock.",

Inoculation of eight pregnant ewes and goats with 109 infectious units (IU) of ChAdOx1 RVF and eight mock-vaccinated pregnant ewes and goats with PBS at day 52/53 of gestation. The animals were challenged intravenously with 105 TCID50 RVFV rec35/74on day 21 post-vaccination (day 73/74 gestation). Plasma (to monitor viraemia) and serum (to measure the antibody response) samples were collected as indicated. At 3 weeks post-challenge, all animals were euthanised, unless reaching humane endpoints prior to this, and the dams and their foetuses examined for signs of abnormalities",

Rectal temperatures, serological responses (RVFV VNT50 titres, anti-N ELISA) and viraemia following vaccination and challenge of pregnant ewes and goats are shown. Data in a, c, e and g are from pregnant ewes, whilst data in b, d, f and h are from pregnant does. Vaccination and challenge were performed as shown in Fig. 1. The black arrows represent the day of challenge. Anti-N ELISA titres (e and f) are expressed as percentage inhibition calculated as ratio of the optical densities (OD) of the sample and the OD of the negative control (% S/N) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All values lower than 40% are considered positive, between 40% and 50% are considered doubtful and above 50% are considered negative. The dotted lines represent the 40% and 50% inhibition. Samples that tested negative for viraemia are depicted at the detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay (1.3 log10 RNA copies/ml). All data are depicted as means and standard errors. p Values from Mann\u2013Whitney U test comparing pre-challenge VNT50 titres (as measured on day 21; c and d) and viraemia levels at 3 days post-challenge (g and h) between mock- and ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated animals are shown; ***p < 0.001",

The time of necropsy varies between groups (ChAdOx1 RVF 23\u201324 DPC and mock-vaccinated 8\u201311 DPC). Placentomes are a combination of maternal and foetal tissue. Samples that were positive by RT-qPCR are colour coded as below, whilst green is used for those that were RT-qPCR negative. Grey shading represents samples that were not available due to autolysis. Samples from which infectious virus could be isolated are marked with an asterisk. Only positive RT-qPCR samples were subjected to viral isolation. N/A (not applicable): does number 241, 244 and 246 were pseudo-pregnant and hence had no foetuses for analysis",
