            "text": "Polyproteins are naturally used by certain viruses to structure their proteome1415. Recombinant polyproteins mimicking viral polyproteins have recently emerged as a powerful tool to express protein complexes for functional characterisation as well as structural determination (reviewed in16). Using this strategy17, soluble and active heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases of influenza B virus (IBV) and bat influenza A (bat-IAV) virus could be produced, crystallized and the structure determined at high resolution56. We have applied a similar strategy to the RdRp of two human-IAV strains, A/Victoria/3/1975(H3N2) and the highly pathogenic A/Viet-Nam/1203/2004(H5N1). The three genes of each heterotrimeric complex were combined with Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease and Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) in a single large open reading frame (ORF). Each gene was separated by a DNA sequence encoding for a peptide segment comprising a short serine/glycine linker and a TEV protease cleavage site (Fig. 1a and supplementary Figure 1). The constructs were optimized for recombinant expression in insect cells using the MultiBac system1819. During expression, the TEV protease cleaves the polyprotein co-translationally, resulting in a stoichiometric assembly of the RdRp that can then be selectively purified using an affinity nickel resin. The production of the polyprotein is monitored using the fluorescence of two reporter proteins: CFP encoded within the polyprotein reports directly on recombinant protein yield, while YFP, integrated in the baculovirus genome, monitors virus performance19. The ratio of YFP/CFP in our system is a highly useful criterion to determine recombinant polyprotein translation efficacy of the different constructs.",

No clear bands were observed on western blot using specific PA, PB1 and PB2 antibodies. Similar results were obtained with the H5N1 RdRp polyprotein, indicating failure of these recombinant expression experiments for these full-length IAV heterotrimeric polymerases. As a comparison, using the same strategy, the YFP/CFP ratio for the expression of IBV or Bat-IAV heterotrimer was close to 20, similar to the ratios we obtained for the expressions of constructs 13 and 15 (i.e. without most of PB2).",

These were PB2(1\u201336)20, PB2(1\u2013116)21 and based on the cap-binding domain22, PB2(322\u2013483). Expression and purification experiments were undertaken on constructs 15, 17 and 18, all of which all have full-length PA, PB1 and truncations of PB2 extending to residues 116, 320 and 483 respectively (Fig. 1b). As the PB2 extension increases beyond residue 116, we observed a loss of expression of the polyprotein, thus identifying a critical region in PB2 that limits yield. This can first of all be observed through the monitoring of YFP/CFP reporter genes during expression (Fig. 1c). YFP fluorescence values reach a similar plateau for all constructs whereas CFP values are reduced significantly for constructs 17 and 18. Moreover, after nickel resin pull-down on lysates from an equal amount of cells, we observed by western blot (Fig. 1d) decreased intensity bands of not only PB2 but also PB1, indicative of an overall expression loss. Polyprotein size increase alone could not explain the reduced expression because other control constructs (19 and 20) with additional protein sequences beyond PB2 residue 116 conserve lower YFP/CFP ratios. Furthermore, replacing the PB2(1\u2013116) by another large protein such as RanBP5 (residues 1\u20131115) generates a construct with a lower YFP/CFP ratio than construct 15. The analysis of the amino acids sequences of PB2 does not provide more indication on the real nature of this phenomenon (supplementary Figure 2).",

The expression of PA-PB1 increases significantly when PB2 is totally removed (compare constructs 1 and 13/15; Table 1). The same observation is made after removing the endonuclease domain (i.e. PA-Nter; compare constructs 14 and 13/15). After purification, PA-PB1 forms homogeneous monomeric and stable particles (Fig. 2b) whereas the complexes with PB2 (constructs 15 and 16) give rise to dimers in solution (Fig. 2a). The dimers are stable enough to withstand salt concentrations up to 2 M NaCl during purification, but the SEC elution peaks are broad suggesting that the oligomerization process is quite dynamic. By adding vRNA promoter-like molecules (e.g. the IAV panhandle)24, we found that the dimers dissociated into monomeric RNA:protein complexes. We were able to show that the truncated PA-PB1 (construct 1) and the PA-PB1-PB2 (construct 14) exhibit expected polymerase activities. The endonuclease activity is similar to that of the isolated PA-Nter domain (supplementary Figure 3), can be inhibited by the same point mutation (i.e. PA-E80A) or compound (i.e. DPBA) and shows comparable dependency on manganese2526. The constructs are also functional in RNA synthesis. Upon addition of a mixture of IAV panhandle, NTPs and [\u03b1-32P]-UTP, both truncated PA-PB1 and PA-PB1-PB2 are able to generate an 80-nucleotide long product plus other minor products in absence or in presence of ApG (supplementary Figure 4).",

However, as soon as the PA-hinge (residues 200\u2013260) is removed, PB1 becomes insoluble. This implies that the PA-hinge linking the Nter- and Cter-domains of PA is crucial for the stability of PB1. However, it is not sufficient in itself since the C-terminal region of PA also interacts with the N-terminal part of PB12728 and cannot be deleted either (compare constructs 2 and 5 to 11). PB1 can be shortened on its C-terminus but when purifying the construct 4 (i.e. PB1 until amino acid 560), only PA-Cter remains soluble. Thus, the minimal construct required to obtain soluble PB1 is construct 3 with PA from 197 to 716 and PB1 from 1 to 660. All the PA-PB1 constructs without the N-terminal domain of PA form dimers in solution (supplementary Figure 5) and adding vRNA-like molecules has no incidence on the dimerization.",

For this purpose, we used 5\u2032-vRNAp and 3\u2032-vRNAp, both labelled with fluorescein amidite (FAM) at the opposite extremity of the putative interaction, i.e. at the 3\u2032-end for the 5\u2032-vRNAp and vice versa (Fig. 3 and Table 2). At 300 mM NaCl, the Kd for the 5\u2032-vRNAp are similar (sub-nanomolar) for both constructs 1 and 14, whereas for the 3\u2032-vRNAp, a Kd of 36 nM for the construct with PB2 is obtained (Fig. 3a) and no binding was observed for the construct without PB2 (Fig. 3c). As the estimated Kd for the 5\u2032-end was in a range below the working concentration and beyond the sensitivity limit of the fluorescence anisotropy measurement, another method was required to determine the 5\u2032-vRNAp affinity. Filter binding assays (FBA) were then therefore used for precise Kd determination (Fig. 3b). With the corresponding radioactive probes, we found values of 0.2\u20130.4 nM for the 5\u2032-end. For the 3\u2032-end, the Kd was 100-fold higher and critically dependent on the presence of PB2. Salt concentration is also an important parameter. We show different binding characteristics at 150 and 300 mM NaCl of the PA-PB1 towards different RNAs. The Kd value of PA-PB1 for the 5\u2032-end remains sub-nanomolar in the range of 150 to 300 mM NaCl. In contrast, at 150 mM NaCl, 3\u2032-vRNAp binds to PA-PB1 with the same affinity than for a poly-UC (Fig. 3c), and so is non-specific. All relevant titrations were performed at 300 mM NaCl to prevent non-specific affinity measurements. Recently published affinity data33 working at 500 mM NaCl likewise consistent with very high affinity of the 5\u2032-vRNAp towards IAV polymerase but this study failed to measure 3\u2032-vRNAp binding within the nanomolar range, indicating that 3\u2032-vRNAp binding is also tightly influenced by salt concentration.",

After transcription in the nucleus, viral mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm to be translated by the cellular machinery. The components of the replication machinery (i.e. PA, PB1, PB2 and NP) then must be imported into the nucleus. Whereas PB2 and NP use importins-\u03b1934353637, PA and PB1 are conjointly imported as a preformed heterodimeric submodule by the importin-\u03b2 RanBP5101238. Having confirmed the existence of a stable PA-PB1 complex we sought to demonstrate its interaction with RanPB5. The human IPO5 gene which encodes for RanBP5, was expressed in insect cells. After purification, RanBP5 forms a homogeneous monomeric sample (Fig. 2c) that has been used in mixing experiments with freshly purified PA-PB1(1-686) followed by SEC-MALLS-RI experiments. The two samples were mixed in stoichiometric ratio and incubated before size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Both RanBP5 and PA-PB1(1-686) were eluted in the same single peak, but MALLS-RI indicated a molecular weight corresponding of a mixture rather than a stable ternary complex (supplementary Figure 6). We then attempted to produce a PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 heterotrimer by the self-processing polyprotein strategy. A long ORF encoding for the trimeric complex was created by inserting the IPO5 gene downstream of the PB1(1-686) coding sequence (Table 1, construct 21). Remarkably, from this polyprotein construct, PA-PB1 co-purifies with RanBP5, forming a homogeneous and stable heterotrimer (Fig. 2d).",

Using the Vc determination method39 on the diffusion data of PA-PB1(1-686) shows a Mw estimate of 146 kDa (Table 3 and supplementary Figure 7). The calculated Mw is 166 kDa. The Guinier transform measures a hydrodynamic radius (Rg) of 36.2 \u00c5 and GNOM produces the pair distribution function fit with a Dmax of 128 \u00c5. Further analysis of the SAXS curve (Fig. 4a) shows a visually adequate correlation with the CRYSOL curve which uses the bat-IAV polymerase structure (PDB id: 4WSB) as a model. To evaluate the statistical similarity between experimental intensities and those computed from a model has been derived. The high chi2 values are observed for this dataset, due to a noisy SAXS curve. A slight deviation of the fit is observed above a q range of 0.8 nm\u22121, suggesting conformational differences between the scattering curve and the crystal structure coordinates. Ab-initio modelling was performed using 15 DAMMIF models which were averaged by DAMAVER. Averaged model correlation with the diffusion curve was then checked using the damstart file as a starting envelope for DAMMIN. The polymerase DAMAVER envelope (Fig. 4a) appears as a pear shaped structure in which the homologous model can be fitted. Additional envelope volume is visible close to the endonuclease domain, implying that it adopts multiple conformations in solution.",

CRYSOL curve fitting using the apo form of Kap121 (PDB id: 3W3T) against the diffusion curve reveals important structural and conformational differences between the two structures (Fig. 4b).

MONSA builds ab initio shapes using the scattering curves for complexes together with those of their individual components41. MONSA was used to perform the ab-initio modelling of the complex PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 (supplementary Figure 8). It separately uses the PA-PB1(1-686) and RanBP5 diffusion curves (Fig. 4a,b) in combination with that of PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 to propose a consensus dual envelope (Fig. 4c). Model fitting was performed against the three experimental curves and matches all 3 curves with similar quality. With this ab-initio modelling we also find a comparable envelope for PA-PB1(1-686) like the one produced with DAMMIF/DAMAVER. RanBP5 on the other hand displays a different envelope suggesting conformational differences between the unbound and bound forms of RanBP5. The model suggests a close interaction between the two proteins, RanBP5 (violet envelope) interacts with PA-PB1(1-686) (grey envelope), suggesting molecular contacts well beyond those of the proposed PB1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) containing domain, which the crystal structure shows is a mobile and solvent exposed \u03b2-ribbon6. This model further supports the hypothesis that RanBP5 may play a chaperone function for PA-PB1 prior to assembly with PB2 in the nucleus to complete the polymerase.",

In marked contrast and unexpectedly, efficient expression of active full-length human or avian IAV polymerase at yields high enough for structural studies has not been reported to date, irrespective of the method used. Our studies identify PB2, and notably residues 120 to 250 as responsible for this poor expression. Interestingly, attempts by a different research group to reconstitute a full IAV polymerase (e.g. full IAV polymerase expression/purification for structural studies) likewise failed beyond the N-terminal PB1 interacting domain of PB213. Furthermore, the recent bat-IAV, IBV and ICV RdRp crystal structures have shown that PB2 can adopt a plethora of conformations, demonstrating how dynamic PB2 is within the heterotrimer5674243. The reason why PB2 hinders polyprotein expression is not clear at the moment. We speculate that the extended fold of the PB2 region 1\u2013250 is unstable unless bound to one side of PB156 and thus may require chaperones to maintain its stability prior to assembly onto PA-PB1. Of note, Hsp90 has been shown to stimulate influenza virus RNA synthesis44 and the nuclear import of the subunits35. Moreover, Hsp90 inhibitors reduce influenza virus replication in cell culture45. We have shown previously that provision of co-factors in trans can ameliorate the quality and quantity of target proteins expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system4647. Provision of Hsp90 and the other chaperones, within the polyprotein or in trans on the baculovirus backbone, may provide a powerful handle to overcome the bottleneck of human-AIV polymerase production. Furthermore, although the cellular context between viral infection and the expression of recombinant proteins is different, it cannot be excluded that the polyprotein interferes with the cellular innate immunity. IAV RdRp, and PB2 in particular, has been shown to regulate host anti-viral response through the binding to IPS-1 and the inhibition of interferon \u03b2 production48.",

In contrast, 3\u2032-vRNAp binding requires the presence of PB2 and is within the low nanomolar range, indicating a much stronger preference of the polymerase towards the 5\u2032-vRNAp.

Purification of stoichiometric complexes using the polyprotein strategy confirms that PA-PB1 can exist as a preformed and stable submodule, independently of additional host factors, with PA acting as a putative \u201cchaperone\u201d for PB1. Our data also shows that PA-PB1 is functional in RNA synthesis, which has interesting physiological implications. Moreover, we demonstrate here that the PA-PB1(1-686) heterodimer can assemble with RanBP5 into a stable, heterotrimeric complex that can be purified in vitro. This likely corresponds to the import complex for these two subunits, although other chaperones such as HSP90 may be co-imported35. In contrast to PA-PB1 with RanBP5, we failed to reconstitute a binary PB2-importin-\u03b1 complex using the polyprotein strategy even though functional and structural data show that PB2 nuclear import depends on the importin-\u03b1 pathway, through a direct interaction between the PB2 C-terminal domain that contains the NLS89. This is probably partly due to an inherent instability of isolated IAV PB2 in insect cells but could also reflect the lack of sufficient chaperones, co-chaperones or other unidentified factors that stabilise PB2. Furthermore, cytoplasmic expression of PB2 appears to destabilise many cellular processes5051. We also still do not know the reason for the difference in the import pathway usage between the PA-PB1 submodule and PB2. The lack of high expression levels of fully assembled PA-PB1-PB2 heterotrimers unfortunately currently limits our efforts to elucidate the structure of the complete human IAV polymerase at atomic resolution. Nevertheless, docking of bat-IAV and IBV crystal structures into the PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 SAXS envelope suggests that assembly of PB2 onto the PA-PB1-RanBP5 complex might be possible, based on steric considerations. Indeed RanBP5 could even facilitate trimer assembly perhaps concomitantly with Ran-dependent dissociation from PA-PB1. In contrast, RanBP5 profoundly affects the ability of PA-PB1 to bind vRNA. We show that whereas the 5\u2032-vRNA is specifically recognized by PA-PB1 with high affinity, this is abolished in the ternary complex with RanBP5. This again suggests that RanBP5 disassociation may be coupled to assembly of the polymerase with the promoter RNA. In any case, only when PB2 associates is the polymerase able to associate with the 3\u2032-vRNA end, consistent with the crystal structures56. But surprisingly, the affinity of the heterotrimer for 3\u2032-vRNA is in the same order of magnitude than the affinity of NP for RNA substrates (Table 2), revealing a potential competition between the complete polymerase heterotrimer and the nucleoprotein.",

Functional studies on IAV RdRp reveal that vRNAp promoter binding is completely abolished when PA-PB1(1-686) is bound to RanBP5, suggesting a possible role for RanBP5 in maintaining PA-PB1 in an inactive form during nuclear import. This discovery holds a promise for influenza research as it provides a novel point of therapeutic intervention for targeting and inhibiting influenza virus during assembly of its active components. We anticipate that compounds which block polymerase/RanBP5 binding or release may prove to be highly efficient, broad spectrum antiviral inhibitors in the treatment of influenza, in particular for patient groups where classical vaccination strategies fail.",
