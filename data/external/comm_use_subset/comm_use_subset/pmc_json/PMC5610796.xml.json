In the township of Ve Golokuati, the Afadzato South District capital in the Volta Region of Ghana, several \u201ccamps\u201d of E. gambianus roost in mango and other fruit trees that provide shade and other ecosystems services for residents. Concerns have been raised about the closeness of bats to humans because of the ability of the former to spread zoonotic diseases [3\u20137]. Viruses isolated from bats include lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and related coronaviruses (SARS-related CoV), filoviruses, henipaviruses, and other paramyxoviruses [2, 8, 9]. Living in close proximity to bats enables people to benefit from the ecosystem services that bats provide and may, simultaneously, put them at risk of disease spillover, which may be referred to as \u201cecosystems disservice.\u201d Hunting and processing of bats for consumption potentially expose humans to zoonotic pathogens from bats through bites, scratches, and body fluids, as well as aerosolization of saliva, faeces, and/or urine [10, 11].",

Filoviruses, such as Lake Victoria Marburgvirus which recorded high fatalities between 1998 and 2000 in DR Congo [16] and the Ebolavirus, have been most widespread in Africa [9]. Ebola outbreaks have been recurring since the first major case in DR Congo in 1995, which affected more than 260 humans and caused 186 deaths, was reported [14]. The most recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 infecting about 27,898 people and causing 11,296 reported deaths [17] raised public apprehension about human-bat interactions. This is because the outbreak has been traced back to a single incident of a young child playing in the vicinity of a hollow tree frequented by bats [18], now identified as a potential source of spillover of the EBV [11, 14, 19]. The ability of bats to spread zoonotic diseases and the fact they live close to humans heighten the potential threat of disease spillover.",

They are well known for their roles in seed dispersal, pollination, maintaining soil fertility, and aiding in nutrient distribution [6, 20, 21]. Muscarella and Fleming [20] noted that bats facilitate seed dispersal in clear-cut strips as a result of how they defaecate and spit out seeds during flight. They also observed that many fruit bats use one or more feeding roosts each night and tend to deposit the vast majority of seeds ingested far away from fruiting plants. Through this habit, bats help to maintain species diversity by introducing seeds from outside disturbed areas. Bats in general have further been identified as bioindicators through their sensitivity to climate change, environmental degradation, and contamination by agrochemicals and other toxins [22, 23].",

While some earlier studies indicated that urbanization results in decreases in diversity and abundance of bats [26], others believe that the prevailing conditions and the patterns of development in the urban periphery encourage bats to concentrate in those areas [25, 27]. Urbanization can thus support bat-related activities and enhance ecosystem services for humans.

According to Fenton [30], they roost in large hollow trees, thick foliage, and tree canopies along stream banks and below the thatch of open sheds. They roost low in trees during the day and are not disturbed by the presence of people [30]. Apart from the nuisance created from noise [1], not much has been documented on how their proximity affects humans and, until recently, this was not considered to be a problem. In addition, there have been no records of any disease spillover from bats to humans in Ghana or in the study area. The Ebola outbreak in parts of West Africa in 2014, as well as its link to bats as a potential source of contagion [31], has heightened people's concern [18] about bat-human interactions and their sense of risk. Thus better understandings of the cohabitation of humans and wild animals and the potential implications for human well-being are required urgently.",

With regard to the use of bats as food, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that there was 98% chance of more men eating bat bushmeat than women. This is statistically significant and may be attributed to some cultural prohibitions on bat consumption by pregnant women. For instance, the focus group participants believed that bats have no rectum and, therefore, vomit their excreta. For this reason, pregnant women were not allowed to eat bats; else they risked transmitting the \u201cvomiting habit\u201d to their babies after birth. Among the women respondents who claimed that they ate bat bushmeat, none of them had done so when they were pregnant because of this belief, yet this did not prevent women in general from eating bat bushmeat, as one middle aged woman disclosed:I have always enjoyed bat meat because it is more delicious compared to other types of meat.

Pets, notably cats and dogs, live within households but are also left to roam about freely within the township to hunt and scavenge for food. The threat of exposure to disease, through human-bat interactions, is reinforced by the predatory behaviour of the pied crow (Corvus albus) which targets the young E. gambianus just as they are being weaned. According the respondents, the crows often left bat carcasses which were often scavenged by dogs.

Furthermore, the bats within the township were protected from threats and other disturbances better than in the wild. In a number of locations in Ghana where bats occur, they are under some form of protection for various reasons such as traditional taboos, military presence, or deliberate protection [42]. Human-bat interaction occurs for a number of reasons. Hayman et al. [7] observed that such interaction occurs because humans are encroaching on bats' habitats, just as bats are utilizing human structures as roosts. The interactions may be indirect, in the form of odour from faecal droppings, urine, aerosolization of saliva, and glandular body secretions [43]. It may also be direct through hunting and processing of bat bushmeat for consumption [2, 10]. In Ve Golokuati, the findings showed that human interaction with bats is both direct and indirect, which suggests that the residents may be at risk to disease spillover. The \u201chost-parasite continuum\u201d framework [28], suggests that wildlife, domestic animals, and human populations coexist and that disease spillover occurs within a finely balanced host-agent continuum. The framework highlights the ways in which underlying factors such as agricultural intensification, translocation, and human encroachment are responsible for emerging infectious diseases.",

By doing so, bats droppings on roof tops would be washed away before water harvesting starts. Residents also need to be educated on the need to avoid drinking untreated harvested rainwater. In order to reduce human exposures to bats, traditional leaders including the chief and elders may have to enforce prohibitions on hunting of bats to minimize disturbance and to create a safe haven for the bats. In the long term, improved diagnostics and systematic surveillance of zoonotic disease are required, coupled with regular health screening of the residents of Ve Golokuati, as well as other communities in Ghana where bats live in close proximity with humans.",
