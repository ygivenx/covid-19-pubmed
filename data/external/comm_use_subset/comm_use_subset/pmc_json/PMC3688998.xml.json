            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and is one of the most important mosquito-borne diseases with a mortality rate as high as 20% to 50%, and is widely distributed in most of East and South-east Asia and parts of Oceania. Up to 50,000 human cases of JE are reported annually in Asian countries, of which 10,000\u201315,000 result in fatality [1]. A high proportion (nearly 50%) of survivors, especially young children and those greater than 65 years of age, exhibit permanent neurologic and psychiatric sequelae. A wide range of animals including swine, equines and birds can also be infected. Pigs, as well as birds, serve as amplifying and reservoir hosts [2], [3]. Further, JEV infection has accounted for significant economic losses in the pig industry due to fetal encephalitis and reproductive failure in pregnant sows and hypospermia in boars [4]. There is no specific treatment available for JE, and vaccination is the only effective way to prevent JEV infection in humans and domestic animals. JEV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against JE [5], [6]. Further, like other flaviviruses, NS1 is able to elicit protective immunity without the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. These characteristics make NS1 an attractive alternative immunogen. As such, much research is currently being devoted to NS1-based vaccine development [7], [8], [9]. Although NS1 is not present in the virion, NS1-induced antibodies can protect against infection in vivo by an undetermined mechanism, which presumably depends on the Fc portion of the antibody since they kill their target cells through a complement-dependent pathway [10], [11].",

            "text": "JEV is a member of the family Flaviviridae, and the genus Flavivirus, and is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. Besides JEV, the Japanese encephalitis virus serocomplex of Flaviviridae includes the West Nile virus (WNV), Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEM). JEV serogroup viruses and Dengue virus (DENV) have a similar ecology; it is very common that two or more of these flaviviruses co-circulate in some regions of the world [12]\u2013[15], and cross-reactivity can be demonstrated among these flaviviruses in serological tests. These cross-reactive responses could confound the interpretation of results during serological testing, including neutralization tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) [16]. This serves to emphasize the utility of virus-specific epitopes for the differential diagnosis of disease and epidemiological surveys. The serological cross-reactivity is primarily caused by cross-reactive epitopes on the structural protein E [17], [18]. In contrast, NS1 is more specific in serological testing of flavivirus infections, and it has been reported that NS1 can induce antibodies without cross-reactivity among flaviviruses [14], and even among different serotypes of DENV [19], [20], therefore the development of an NS1-based specific serological diagnosis is of great interest [14], [21], [22]. First, it is necessary to precisely identify the B-cell epitopes on NS1. In this study we have identified and characterized five JEV NS1-specific epitopes with monoclonal antibodies. This work demonstrates progress toward the development of a specific serological diagnostic test for JEV infection, extends our understanding of the antigenic structure of JEV NS1, and could help inform vaccine design.",

Serological cross-reactivity among members of the JEV serocomplex and other flaviviruses could confound detection results [29], especially in regions where two or more flaviviruses co-exist [30]. It was difficult to differentiate between viruses using ELISA or even by neutralization tests or other serological methods. The cross-reactivity among flaviviruses is primarily caused by the E glycoprotein [31]. Though NS1 is thought to contain more virus-specific epitopes than E protein [32], there are epitopes on NS1 of WNV cross-reacted with antibody against JEV-serocomplex virus [33]\u2013[36].

JEV and DENV co-circulate in Southeast Asia [12], and JEV and WNV co-circulate in India [15], so there is an urgent need for differential diagnoses between JEV, WNV and DENV. None of the MAbs in this study reacted to WNV or DENV whole virus antigens or the corresponding NS1 sequences. Furthermore, none of the five JEV NS1 epitopes were recognized by anti-sera against WNV and DENV.
