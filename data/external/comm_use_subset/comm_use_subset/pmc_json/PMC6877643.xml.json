            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in regulating protein synthesis/processing, lipid synthesis, and calcium homeostasis1. During virus infection, many viral proteins are synthesized by ER-associated ribosome and transported into the ER lumen for proper folding or posttranslational modification. This leads to an overwhelming load of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The chaperone Bip then binds to these unfolded/misfolded proteins and releases the ER stress sensors PERK, ATF6, and IRE1\u03b1, triggering unfolded protein response (UPR). PERK is activated by autophosphorylation and in turn phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 on Ser512,3. Phospho-eIF2\u03b1 has increased affinity to the eIF2\u03b2 subunit and prevents the regeneration of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in the ternary complex eIF2-GTP-MettRNAi, thus halting the initiation of protein translation4. However, ATF4 mRNA is preferentially translated and promotes the transcription of genes important for cellular remediation or apoptosis, including CHOP5. Another eIF2\u03b1 kinase, PKR, also elicits eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP signaling in response to virus infection6\u20138. ATF6 dissociates from Bip and moves to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved into N-terminal fragment ATF6-N and subsequently translocated to the nucleus as an active transcription factor, triggering the transcription of protein chaperones and components of ER-associated degradation (ERAD)9\u201311. The IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 branch is the most evolutionarily conserved in Eukarya12. After dissociating from Bip, IRE1\u03b1 undergoes homo-oligomerization and autophosphorylation, obtaining both kinase and endoribonuclease activity13. This endoribonuclease leads to unconventional enzymatic splicing of XBP1u mRNA into XBP1s by removing the 26-nucleotide intron. The spliced mRNA is then translated into transcription factor XBP1s, controlling the expression of the ER quality control genes and components of ERAD11,13\u201315. IRE1\u03b1 also degrades ER-associated mRNAs to attenuate protein load in the ER lumen16.",

            "text": "If ER homeostasis cannot be restored, UPR drives the damaged or infected cells to apoptosis17. Apoptosis is triggered by either intrinsic signaling or extrinsic death ligands. The intrinsic pathway is under the control of the BCL-2 protein family18. Pro-survival guardian proteins (BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-xL) inhibit apoptosis through binding and sequestering pro-apoptotic activators (BID, BIM, PUMA, and NOXA) or effectors (BAX and BAK). When enough activators have been stimulated by cytotoxic stresses, BAX is released from pro-survival guardian proteins and oligomerizes to form pores on the mitochondrial outer membrane, thereby releasing cytochrome c and activating caspase 919\u201321. Under persistent ER stress, the induction of CHOP may promote cell apoptosis by regulating the expression of BCL-2, TRB3, death receptor 5, ERO1\u03b1, and GADD34, and perturbing the cellular redox state22\u201324. IRE1\u03b1 may promote apoptosis through interacting with TRAF2 and ASK1, in turn activating pro-apoptotic JNK25. Prolonged UPR is also an inflammatory nidus and may elicit a defensive innate immune response against the invading pathogen. Activation of IRE1\u03b1-JNK leads to the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines26. NF-\u043aB is activated by IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2 mediated I\u03baB phosphorylation and degradation27. In another way, when protein translation is halted by PERK-eIF2\u03b1 signaling, the ratio of NF-\u043aB to I\u043aB is increased, and NF-\u043aB is then released and activated28,29.",

To study whether NDV induces apoptosis in host cells and human cancer cells, chicken cells CEF and DF-1, human cancer cells HeLa, Cal27, HN13, A549, H1299, Huh7, and HepG2, were infected with Herts/33, a virulent strain of NDV. These infected cells were then subjected to apoptosis analysis. The non-cancerous human embryonic kidney cells, 293T, were infected as a control cell type. Due to space limitations, we presented the results from HeLa cells in Figs. 1\u20138 and the results for other cell lines in supplementary figures. As expected, at 20 h.p.i., increased number of TUNEL positive cells was observed in HeLa (Fig. 1a), as well as in CEF, DF-1, Cal27, HN13, A549, H1299, Huh7, and HepG2 cells (Fig. S1A); only few TUNEL positive cells were observed in 293T cells (Fig. S1A). Annexin V/PI staining confirmed that NDV indeed induced functional apoptosis in chicken and human cancer cells, but not in 293T cells (Fig. 1b, Fig. S1B). Immunoblotting showed that in HeLa, Cal27, HN13, A549, and H1299 cells, both major biochemical markers of apoptosis, caspase-3 and PARP, were cleaved into smaller fragments in an infection time-dependent manner; in Huh7 and HepG2 cells, weak cleavage of PARP appeared at 24 h.p.i.; no cleavage of both biochemical markers was observed in 293T cells (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1C). Due to unavailabilbty antibodies, chicken cells were not included in the immunoblotting analysis. These observations suggest that NDV infection triggers functional apoptosis in chicken cells and many human cancer cell types, but not in non-cancerous 293T cells.",

In the mock-infected group, there was basal level of phospho-PERK, probably due to the removal of serum in the culture medium (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2). The phospho-PERK was clear observed in NDV-infected Hela cells at 16 and 20 h.p.i. (Fig. 2a), however, in other cancer cell lines, the level of phospho-PERK in NDV-infected cells was lower than or comparable to that in mock-infected cells, probably due to the cleavage of PERK-FL or other unknown mechanisms (Fig. S2). Meanwhile, phospho-eIF2\u03b1 was gradually increased at late infection time points in HeLa cells (Fig. 2a), and in HN13, A549, Huh7, HepG2, and 293T cells (Fig. S2). The failure to observe the increase of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 in NDV-infected Cal27 and H1299 cells might be attributed to the high basal level of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 in mock-infected cells. These results demonstrate that NDV infection induces the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in various cancer cells; however, the cleavage of PERK may attenuate the activation of PERK-eIF2\u03b1 branch. Meanwhile, NDV infection greatly stimulated the phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1 in HeLa (Fig. 2a), Cal27, HN13, A549, H1299, Huh7, and HepG2 cells, but not in 293T cells (Fig. S2). The level of full-length ATF6 (ATF6-FL) was gradually decreased at late infection time in HeLa (Fig. 2a), Cal27, A549, H1299, Huh7, and 293T, but not in HN13 and HepG2 (Fig. S2). Although we failed to detect the cleavage band of ATF6, the nuclear translocation of ATF6 was indeed observed in NDV-infected HeLa cells (Fig. 2b). These results demonstrate that NDV infection triggers the eIF2\u03b1, IRE1\u03b1, and ATF6 signaling in most cancer cell types studies.",

To eliminate the possibility of off target by chemical treatment, we specifically knocked down or overexpressed IRE1\u03b1. Compared with control group, knock down of IRE1\u03b1 reduced the level of XBP1s to undetectable level (Fig. 6e); in contrast, overexpression of IRE1\u03b1 produced 2-fold of XBP1s (Fig. 6f).

Results in Fig. 8d, e showed that both inhibition and knocking down of JNK reduced the levels of phospho-TBK1, phospho-IRF3 and phospho-p65; surprisingly, virus proliferation was also suppressed. Accordingly, the transcription of TNF-\u03b1, IL6, and IL8 was markedly suppressed; the transcription of IFN-\u03b2 was significantly suppressed by the inhibitor treatment, but only slightly decreased in JNK knock down cells (Fig. S5A, B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that JNK promotes cytokines transcription during NDV infection, probably via regulation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 signaling.

The full understanding of the involvement of these UPR branches in NDV replication process appears to be complicated. In addition to helping NDV spread to neighbor cells by triggering apoptosis, the global translation shut off caused by PERK/PKR-eIF2\u03b1 signaling may allow the translational machinery hacked by virus and translate the viral proteins preferentially. Alternatively, the expression of ER quality control proteins, which are controlled by IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 pathway, promotes virus replication by enhancing the viral proteins modification, folding, and trafficking. Another possibility is that XBP1s stimulates the phospholipid biosynthesis and ER expansion64, providing the lipid that is necessary for the enveloped virus particle assembly. Activation of JNK by UPR not only contributes to apoptosis, but also initiates inflammation by promoting the transcription of cytokines. The secretion of cytokines may attract the phagocyte to engulf the infected-apoptotic cells. In all, this study provides comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of UPR induced apoptosis and cytokinesecretion during NDV infection.",
