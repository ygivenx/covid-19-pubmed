CoVs are large, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause acute and prolonged infections in a variety of mammals and birds. Pathogenic human CoVs include members of the genus Alphacoronavirus, termed human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 and HCoV-229E, as well as members of the genus Betacoronavirus, termed HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. These endemic viruses cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans worldwide. Past zoonotic descent can be inferred for HCoV-OC43 and -229E, respectively [1\u20134]. Actual zoonotic acquisition is known for two betacoronaviruses that both cause severe lung disease in humans. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic agent that is frequently and repeatedly acquired by humans upon contact with dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa [5, 6]. This virus seems to cause only limited human-to-human transmission, but is considered a major threat to global public health due to recurring nosocomial outbreaks that may facilitate onward adaptation to humans [7\u20139]. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV caused an epidemic with sustained human-to-human transmission during 2002 to 2003 in China and other countries, involving more than 8,000 notified infections with a case fatality proportion of about 10% [10, 11].",

The type I interferon (IFN) response is an effective antiviral barrier that may limit zoonotic cross-host infection in general terms [23, 24]. CoV infection is sensed by melanoma differentiation antigen 5 (MDA5) and signaled via mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), stimulator of IFN genes (STING), and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), eventually leading to type I IFN gene transcription [25, 26].",

Within the viral structural and accessory proteins, proteins 3b, 6, as well as the nucleocapsid protein have been demonstrated to antagonize type I IFN (e.g., [27]). However, these viral proteins are expressed only after polyprotein processing, nonstructural gene expression, and subgenomic RNA transcription and, therefore, antagonize the downstream effects of IFN receptor signaling rather than the induction of IFN. Distinct from the above SARS-CoV IFN antagonists, the papain-like protease (PLP) is an IFN antagonist that constitutes a domain of the replicase polyprotein and, therefore, may be active at an early stage of the replication cycle to antagonize an upstream step of IFN induction. Additionally, unlike accessory proteins, which can vary greatly between CoV species, maintenance of PLP catalytic activity is critical to viral replication and is therefore conserved across all CoVs [28, 29].",

PLP protease activity catalyzes the processing of the replicase polyprotein at cleavage sites between nsp1/nsp2, nsp2/nsp3, and nsp3/nsp4. PLP deubiquitinating (DUB) activity has been demonstrated in several CoV species, and acts directly and indirectly on several signal molecules in the IRF-3-dependent IFN induction pathway including retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and STING [30, 31]. K63-linked polyubiquitin chains play a general role in signaling cascades of the proinflammatory and IFN systems. K48-linked polyubiquitins label proteins for degradation by the proteasome and activate proinflammatory and antiviral factors. For instance, NF\u03baB is activated by proteasomal degradation of its inhibiting factor I\u03baB [32]. PLP DUB function also involves deISGylating activity, causing the removal of ISG15 modifications from viral and host proteins [33, 34]. ISG15 is an IFN-inducible, antiviral protein that structurally resembles K48-linked di-ubiquitins. It can also be deconjugated by PLPs of other RNA viruses, in particular the ovary tumor (OTU) domain in the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) of arteriviruses, and the L-gene-encoded OTU domain of nairoviruses [35, 36]. The protease recognition sequence LXGG is common to cleavage sites in the viral protein as well as ubiquitin and its derivatives. The DUB- and deISGylating activities in CoV PLPs should therefore be widely conserved.",

The processing of ISG15 and K48-linked di-ubiquitin is more effective for SARS- than MERS-CoV PLP [37]. The blocking of induction of IFN by DUB activity was also confirmed for MERS-CoV, but in contrast to SARS-CoV, this inhibition is not independent of PLP\u2019s protease activity [40, 41].

In SO-PLP the aspartic acids (D1826) are replaced by an asparagine (N). This alternative type of catalytic domain was previously described for other cysteine proteases [47].

During establishment of the assay we noticed a considerable level of mRNA splicing while expressing SR-PLP under the control of a chicken \u03b2-actin promoter (S1 Fig). Codon-optimized constructs were therefore generated. The truncated nsp3-GFP product was detectable by Western blot using anti-GFP epitope tag antibodies with all PLPs (Fig 2A; lanes 2, 4 and 6). To confirm that the protease activity of SR-PLP and SO-PLP depended on the same typical catalytic domain as in SA-PLP, the catalytic cysteines of each PLP (C1651) were changed to alanines. For SA-PLP this mutation was previously shown to abolish PLP activity [46]. The mutants are henceforth referred to as CA-mutants. As expected, each PLP CA-mutant was unable to process the SARS nsp2/3-GFP substrate (Fig 2A; lanes 3, 5 and 7). To confirm PLP expression in all cases, Western blots were done on the same cell lysates using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope tag fused to PLPs. It was found that the expression levels of all PLPs were equal (Fig 2A, lower panel).",

Viral plaques with similar morphologies were observed for the recombinant wild type virus (rSCV, Fig 3B) and the chimeric virus (SR-PLP-rSCV, Fig 3C), indicating that the SR-PLP was able to functionally compensate the SA-PLP. As already suggested by protease cleavage assays, SR-PLP-rSCV was slightly less sensitive against protease inhibitor 3e than SA-PLP-rSCV (rSCV: IC50 = 2.36 \u03bcM; SR-PLP-rSCV: IC50 = 11.02 \u03bcM), providing additional evidence for functional and structural integrity of SR-PLP in the context of SARS-CoV replication (Fig 3D). To exclude the possibility that 3e was cytotoxic, a cell viability assay was conducted. The number of viable cells decreased with increasing amounts of inhibitor to a minimum of 80% at the highest dose of 50 \u03bcM (S2 Fig). This confirms the specific action of 3e.",

Because PLP IFN antagonism functions have been linked to IRF-3 function, a sensitive assay for IRF-3 nuclear translocation was established. Nuclear translocation of an overexpressed IRF-3/GFP fusion protein was stimulated by superinfection with Rift Valley fever virus clone 13 (RVFV Cl 13), an RVFV-mutant devoid of the IFN induction antagonist NSs. RVFV Cl 13 is known to trigger a strong IFN response [52, 53]. The proportion of cells with nuclear translocation of GFP signal was counted microscopically. As summarized in Fig 5A and 5B, ectopic expression of SA- and SR-PLP blocked the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 to comparable levels (SA-PLP: 18% and SR-PLP: 20% of cellular IRF-3/GFP fusion proteins located in the nucleus). The SO-PLP of the outlying virus blocked the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 even more efficiently (3% of cellular IRF-3/GFP fusion proteins located in the nucleus). For all PLPs, CA-mutants were included in the experiment to determine whether anti-IFN effects depended on protease function. The inhibitory capacity of the SA- and SO-PLP CA-mutants were strongly reduced, but still detectable at significant levels (SA-PLP: 71% and SO-PLP: 45% of cells with IRF-3/GFP fusion protein located in the nucleus). In contrast, the SR-PLP CA-mutant had essentially lost its ability to block IRF-3 nuclear translocation (94% of cells with nuclear IRF-3/GFP signal).",

However, overexpression assays cannot reflect the whole complexity of the viral life cycle including the timing and compartmentalization of functions. To detect more the subtle differences that we expected to occur between natural virus variants, we generated an infectious clone carrying the reservoir-derived PLP in an otherwise unmodified SARS-CoV backbone. Growth properties of the chimeric virus in IFN-deficient Vero cells confirmed that the reservoir-derived PLP effectively cleaved the viral polyprotein and supported recombinant virus replication kinetics comparable to wild type SARS-CoV. Only when grown in cells with a fully active IFN system, wild type SARS-CoV replicated better than the PLP-chimeric virus. The small but significant growth differences ranged between 2.6 (Calu-3) and 10.3-fold (HAE) depending on the time point post infection and the applied cell cultures. We assume that other viral proteins with IFN antagonistic functions, like protein 6 and 3b, might have compensated for the decreased immune-modulating functions of SR-PLP and PLP/M209R preventing a more pronounced growth difference [27]. Importantly, we showed that the effect was increased when artificial IFN was added to the cell cultures and was additionally accompanied by a more efficient blocking of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA upregulation, obtaining further confirmation for the specificity of the PLP function within the IFN response.",

The likely mechanism for this additional activity has been identified by in-vitro studies to involve binding of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers [34, 54, 58]. Here we confirmed the functional link between DUB functions and IFN antagonism for the first time in a replicating CoV. Because the cytopathogenic nature of SARS-CoV infection prevented sensitive cell-based assays for DUB- and deISGylating functions, we relied on knowledge of structure-function relationships from a study on equine arteritis virus (EAV), an arterivirus related to CoVs [35]. In EAV PLP2, a ubiquitin-binding surface distinct from the protease active site was identified and mutagenized without causing a loss of protease processing. A definite link to IFN antagonism was established by engineering of a destabilizing mutation into the ubiquitin-binding surface in an EAV infectious clone, causing increased induction of IFN during replication. By introduction of a homologous mutation in our SARS-CoV infectious clone, we found an even clearer loss of IFN antagonism than with EAV. The choice of the mutation was informed by another study that defined the primary ubiquitin-binding surface in SARS-CoV PLP and found position M209 to critically interact with a conformational binding patch (I44, V70, L8) on ubiquitin but to not affect protease activity [54]. Concordantly, we found no signs of catalytic inactivation of the M209 mutant in Vero cells where it replicates like wild type virus, and a pattern of fully protease-dependent IFN antagonism like that of the reservoir-derived PLP. We conclude that ubiquitin binding constitutes an anti-IFN function of SARS-CoV PLP that is independent of the conserved protease function, is phenotypically relevant for replication level and immune evasion, and is variable among viral variants.",

The present study did not use in vivo models to evaluate the consequences of the introduced mutations on replication.

            "text": "Based on the PLP structure, there is huge potential for natural sequence variants to influence ubiquitin-binding. For instance, PLP has a second ubiquitin-binding site enabling a bi-dentate binding mechanism that may explain the PLP preference for di-ubiquitins and ISG15 [54]. Crystallization of PLP in complex with K48-linked di-ubiquitin identified the structure of the second binding site (Ub2), which seems to be more critical for K48-linked di-ubiquitin-binding than the primary binding surface [38]. The primary ubiquitin-binding surface (Ub1) is more critical for ISG15 binding [38, 60]. The SARS-CoV strains found in reservoirs in China and Europe show several variants at both ubiquitin-binding sites that could be studied for effects on replication level or other virulence traits (Fig 8A).",

            "text": "In silico modeling of the ubiquitin-binding sites of SA- and SR-PLP shows that sequence variations may even cause structural changes in- and adjacent to the binding sites (Fig 8B and 8C). The fact that, apart from our observed functional differences, there may also be structural changes between two closely related PLPs of a single virus species (the species \u201cSARS-related CoV\u201d) is particularly intriguing as such differences were previously only seen among CoVs that belong to different virus genera. The PLP of HCoV-NL63, for example, has similar protease-independent anti-IFN functions as the PLP of SARS-CoV whereas MERS-CoV PLP anti-IFN activity clearly depends on protease function [34, 37]. The existence of functional diversity in the reservoir makes sense in light of viral evolution and emergence. For instance, the capacity to modulate processing and substrate binding in separate domains of PLP opens the possibility for reservoir-associated CoVs to adjust fitness or virulence levels based on changes in host population structure. Increased virulence may confer increased transmission rates, but may come at the cost of host population decline. Based on our data it seems that the reservoir contains a considerable degree of functional variability that is based on highly conserved host functions such as the ubiquitin systems. Virus adaptation to the human host may not only be an evolved property at the beginning of virus emergence. Rather, the reservoir may contain pre-formed virulence traits that can be predicted by experiments informed by detailed knowledge of molecular virus functions, enabling new approaches to forecast emergence potential.",

The alignment shows strains (represented as grey lines) with unique mutations (black vertical bars). The ubiquitin-binding surfaces are highlighted in orange (Ub1) and magenta (Ub2), respectively. The proposed localization of Ub1 and Ub2 is depicted in the cartoon below the alignment. SA- and SR-PLP, which were investigated in the presented study, are highlighted in red. Homology modelling for SR-PLP was done to compare the interaction surfaces between SA- and SR-PLP, respectively, and the two ubiquitin molecules of a K48-linked di-ubiquitin. Molecular graphics and analyzes were performed with the UCSF Chimera package [71] with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLP in complex with a K48-linked di-ubiquitin (PDB entry 5e6j) as template and the amino acid sequence of SR-PLP as a target. Putative amino acid contact points between SA- and SR-PLP and Ub1 (b) and Ub2 (c) highlight the conformational variability of both PLPs in ubiquitin-binding. The tertiary structure of SA-PLP is shown in dark blue, while the SR-PLP tertiary structure is shown in light blue.",
