The most common mode of transmission of these immunosuppressive retroviruses is through bite wounds. FeLV infection is also commonly acquired via the oronasal route through mutual grooming, nursing, or sharing of dishes [2]. The known risk factors for acquiring these infections are male sex, adulthood, and exposure to outdoors, whereas being neutered and indoor lifestyle are known protective factors [3]. Recent studies estimate a seroprevalence of 2.3% (FeLV) and 2.5% (FIV) in the United States (US) [4] and 3.4% (FeLV) and 4.3% (FIV) in Canada [1].",

            "text": "Despite decades of discovery, clinical management of cats infected with FIV and FeLV is still challenging without the existence of an effective therapeutic intervention [3]. Therefore, better ways to control the infections and prophylactic management is the mainstay of disease prevention strategy for these infections. A number of previous studies have suggested that the prevalence of retroviral infections in domestic cat populations varies by regions and maybe attributed to variable population density, reproductive status, age, gender, and housing conditions [5\u201311]. For the US and Canada, spatial variation in FIV and FeLV seroprevalence has been reported in previous studies that generated data for this research [1, 4]. Here we attempt to extend the findings by applying spatial statistical methods to illustrate geographic variation in the distribution of FIV and FeLV infections and assess the relationship with group-level risk factors. Spatial epidemiological methods are commonly used to identify, describe, and quantify spatial patterns in the distribution of health events. Spatial patterns commonly of interest include trends, clustering, and detection of clusters in the occurrence of health events in a population. Furthermore, geographic correlation studies can be important tools to evaluate the association of spatial or environmental risk factors with the occurrence of health events after adjusting for confounders. The identification of such spatial patterns may provide clues for further testable hypotheses about an unknown disease etiology [12]. Ecological studies, such as geographic correlation studies, are particularly valuable when an individual level association between infection and risk factors is evident and a group-level association is assessed to determine the population health impact [13]. To this effect, spatial analysis of FIV and FeLV infections can be a valuable tool in epidemiological understanding of these infections.",

However, the way areal units are defined can influence the results and inferences based on aggregated data. Specifically, the number or size of areas used and how the area boundaries are drawn can influence spatial data analysis. This has been termed the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and is a long known phenomenon [14, 15] in the geographical literature. The MAUP stems from the fact that areal units are usually arbitrarily determined and can be modified to form units of different sizes or spatial arrangements [16]. The MAUP consists of two interrelated components\u2014the scale and zoning effects. The scale effect is the variation in results obtained when the areal data comprising smaller areal units is grouped to form increasingly larger units. The zoning effect, on the other hand, is the variation in results obtained due to alternative formations of areal units where the number of areal units is constant, that is, analysis comprising the same number of areal units but different area shapes [14, 17, 18].",

In this regard, the presence and strength of spatial clustering of FIV and FeLV infections for each level of aggregation were assessed by Moran's I test on the smoothed seroprevalence estimates using empirical Bayesian smoothing [21]. Since the number of tested cats varied among the areas, smoothed seroprevalence estimates were estimated from crude seroprevalence (number of cats testing positive/number of cats tested) for each area using the empirical Bayesian (EB) estimation such that the area specific seroprevalence estimates were adjusted towards the overall mean.

Furthermore, the spatial scan test can be extended to detect clusters after adjustment for known risk factors or confounders for FIV and FeLV infections. Therefore, the presence of statistically significant high-risk clusters of FIV (or FeLV) infection was investigated using a spatial scan test adjusted for risk factors under the Poisson assumption [25], as implemented in SaTScan version 9.0 [26].",

To apply the Poisson model, it was assumed under the null hypothesis that the number of FIV or FeLV cases in each area followed Poisson distribution with the expected number of cases in each area proportional to the covariate (risk factor) adjusted tested cat population [27]. High-risk cluster detection was performed by comparing the observed number of cases within the scanning window with the expected number, that is, if cases were to be distributed randomly in space [25]. In other words, detection of high-risk clusters would indicate the prevalence of FIV (or FeLV) inside the circular window as significantly higher than outside the window. The statistical significance of the clusters was established by Monte Carlo hypothesis testing using 999 Monte Carlo replications with a significance level set to \u03b1 = 5%. The significance of multiple clusters was tested sequentially conditional on the presence of the previously detected clusters such that secondary clusters were tested and reported only if the more likely clusters were significant [28]. The size of the scanning window in the spatial scan statistic was allowed to increase from individual areas and expanded to include neighbouring areas until a maximum of 50% of the total tested population. No geographical overlap of clusters was allowed. Detected clusters were visualized by plotting respective circles on a map of the study area. The characteristics of detected clusters were compared across aggregation levels to assess the MAUP effect.",

While these studies are similar to ecological regression methods, it is critical to adjust for the spatial autocorrelation in the data in order to prevent type I errors, that is, providing \u201cstatistically significant\u201d results when none exists [30]. Among many proposed methods for spatial regression modeling for areal data [17, 29, 31, 32], Poisson distributed counts for rare disease or infections such as FIV and FeLV can be effectively modeled to assess its relationship with group-level risk factors using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with spatially correlated random effects, also known as spatial GLMM. In this study, interest was to evaluate group-level risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections as well as to quantify the effect of MAUP as change in magnitude and significance of regression parameters with spatial aggregation scale. For each aggregation level, the count of FIV and FeLV infections in each area was modelled as a function of the group-level covariates in a Poisson regression model framework with the log of number of tested cats as the offset.",

The covariates were modelled as dichotomized variables if the relationship was deemed to be nonlinear. This decision was taken to ensure comparability of covariates across the aggregation levels. Covariates were modeled as dichotomous variables with cut-offs for low and high categories set at median value (50%) of the respective covariates. When modeled as predictor variable and not the outcome, the cut-off for categories of covariate FIV and FeLV seroprevalence was set at 3%, 8% and over 8%. The cut-off of 3% is the general prevalence of FIV and FeLV in cats in North America. Since all the covariates are deemed clinically important risk factors, they were included as fixed effects in a multivariable model, with no interactions. Further, the same model was fit to data at all 3 levels of aggregation (state, county, and postal code) to avoid any influence of the selection method or covariate(s) exclusion in the comparison of models [33].

Given the infectious nature of both retroviruses, areas near each other are expected to have similar seroprevalence levels. Therefore, positive autocorrelation in FIV and FeLV seroprevalence was expected. As the data are aggregated, variations at lower levels of aggregation dissolve to form more homogenous areas in terms of population characteristics [17]. With the postal codes aggregated to counties and states, the variability in seroprevalence estimates evident at the scale of postal code and counties likely diminished as the seroprevalence estimates were averaged (Table 1(b)). Generally, spatial aggregation is expected to increase spatial correlations [38]. However, in this study the opposite effect was observed, and the spatial autocorrelation present at postal and county levels disappeared at state level. This may imply that the biological processes which are associated with the clustering of infected cats at local levels (i.e., postal codes and counties) become irrelevant or unobservable at higher aggregation levels (i.e., states). It is important to note that there is a random aspect to the effects of the MAUP and it may be difficult to generalize about how different datasets with different spatial units are affected by the MAUP [15]. Furthermore, the aggregation process itself may induce positive spatial autocorrelation, particularly if the aggregation process allows overlapping units [15] such as postal code to form counties. Unfortunately, not all postal code areas or counties in the US and Canada were sampled for this study and Moran's I test was based on a neighbourhood specification of three nearest neighbours. Therefore it is possible to get \u201cfirst three nearest neighbours\u201d areas too distant from a biological perspective on infection, which would tend to aggravate variability and reduce autocorrelation at lower levels of aggregation.",

The sampled counties and postal codes were not very different with respect to population characteristics and thus may be insensitive to aggregation effects. However, it is most likely an artificial effect as most counties had only a few postal codes sampled within them. While multiple clusters were detected for FIV at the postal code level, these were not detected at higher aggregation levels (Figures 1(a)\u20131(c)). Spatial aggregation reduced the sample size from 641 postal codes to 346 counties and 49 states (or provinces) in this study.

This is expected since both infections share similar risk factors [42] and as a result would have similar infection rates. Furthermore, the seroprevalence of FeLV in an area was negatively associated with a higher proportion of young cats, indoor cats, and neutered males. Consequently, the seroprevalence would be higher in areas with greater proportions of adults, outdoor cats, and intact cats due to social interactions related to roaming, breeding, and fighting. Therefore, the areas populated with cats of these characteristics can be expected to harbour cats with higher risk of acquiring retroviral infections. Areas with greater proportions of intact female cats had a lower seroprevalence for FIV than areas with greater proportions of spayed female cats. This finding seems to be counterintuitive from a biological perspective, as similar to areas with greater proportions of intact males; populations with greater proportions of intact females might be expected to be more susceptible to acquire an infection as a result of higher probabilities of animals fighting. However, the predictors that are derived variables (variables constructed as summaries of individual characteristics) in the group level analysis cannot distinguish the individual-level effect of the variable from its contextual or group level effect [43]. Derived variables are constructed mathematically by summarizing the individual characteristics in a group [43], for example, proportion of males in an area.",

Except for FIV and FeLV seroprevalence, this study did not identify any covariate consistently associated with the outcome across all three aggregation levels. The geographic scales on which these two variables are meaningful factors probably include scales larger than postal code. This is likely true, since veterinary clinics generally service areas that overlap several postal code areas or occasionally across county barriers. For other variables, the choice of the aggregation scale seems to affect the significance and magnitude of observed associations. Generally, most of the predictor variables were only significant at lower levels of aggregation. Suggesting that seroprevalence of FIV and FeLV at higher levels of aggregation depend on further group-level factors not considered in this study. It is important that this spatial scale dependence is not overinterpreted as a sole MAUP effect as multivariable analysis is a complex subject and nevertheless can be prone to missing but confounding variables [16]. This study utilized an ecological regression framework based on covariates as derived variables from individual level data [44]. Thus, the associations observed between covariates and the seroprevalence pertain to group levels.
