Emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases have been posing great challenges to the swine industry, among which porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most devastating diseases [3,4]. PRRS virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of PRRS which contains a positive-sense, single-stranded, polyadenylated, 15 kb RNA genome [5]. PRRSV is categorized into two genotypes, type 1 (European type) and type 2 (North American type), which differ by approximately 40% at the genomic level between the two genotypes [6,7,8], and strains within each genotype also vary considerably with genomic differences as high as 20% [9].",

            "text": "Globally, PRRS remains a threat to the swine industry despite many years of combined efforts to combat and control infection and disease [10]. One of the challenges for PRRSV control is the frequent recurrence of PRRS outbreaks in swine farms [11], with a prediction that of farms reporting an outbreak today, 71% will have a recurrence of PRRSV infection within the following two years [12]. The PRRS recurrence is either caused by introduction of a new strain or the resident virus strain. The knowledge of which type of PRRS recurrence is crucial to determine the necessary control methods. Controlling against a new introduction from outside the farm indicates a need for enhanced biosecurity, while a re-break of a resident strain suggests better strategies for an elimination or vaccination program are needed. Another big challenge for PRRS control is that PRRSV vaccine is not completely effective at preventing and controlling infection due to the high genetic diversity of the virus, thus outbreaks still occur in vaccinated herds [13,14,15,16]. A diagnostic method which can provide genetic information about the strain causing infection would allow for identification of potential reasons for vaccination failure, such as limited cross-protection due to high genetic divergence from vaccine [17], or in the case of genetic similarity to vaccine, perhaps a reversion to virulence (escape mutation) of the vaccine itself [18]. In addition to the clinical challenges mentioned above, PRRSV has widely divergent genetic lineages and is a rapidly evolving pathogen with novel variants which seem to be more divergent and virulent than those in the past [10,19,20,21]. The continuous emergence of new virulent strains causes unexpected devastating outbreaks, such as the severe outbreaks of HP-PRRSV in China and MN184 and NADC30 outbreaks in the United States [22,23,24,25]. The increasing incidence of co-infections of multiple strains further complicates PRRS diagnosis and control [26]. Hence, diagnostic tools that can provide more genetic information are extremely important for investigation, prevention, and control strategies for PRRSV outbreaks.",

            "text": "Prompt detection of pathogens during an outbreak is essential for efficient disease control. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing, which has the advantages of short turnaround time and high sensitivity [27,28], is currently the primary molecular diagnostic method for PRRSV detection and is performed routinely in diagnostic laboratories. The current PCR methods can quickly detect the presence of PRRSV in general [29], but cannot identify specific strains unless targeted primers are designed which requires prior knowledge about the strains of interest [26,30]. Nucleic acid sequencing technologies have been incorporated as a new diagnostic tool in recent years to provide necessary support, such as strain information, for PCR in clinical sample diagnostics [31,32,33]. Sequencing approaches have been applied successfully to various fields in virology so far, such as the discovery of novel viruses/strains, whole viral genome sequencing, quasispecies detection, and epidemiological investigations [34,35]. The fact that sequencing is robust and does not need prior knowledge of the pathogens/strains under detection is particularly important for rapid responses to highly variable pathogens, such as PRRSV [36]. The routine use of viral genome sequencing and genomic surveillance will not only serve as a powerful tool for PRRSV detection [37], but also provides researchers with a better understanding of PRRSV epidemiology and how the virus transmits, spreads, and evolves, thus facilitating effective prevention and control measures [38].",

These extra steps not only introduce bias, but also increase the sequencing time, making rapid diagnosis difficult [39,40,41]. The Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer allows for sequencing of the RNA molecule directly, in its native format. This feature, together with other characteristics such as low start-up costs, portability, and real-time data streaming, makes the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer a good candidate for rapid RNA virus detection, even in resource-limited or remote areas [40,42,43]. Influenza virus was the first pathogen to be successfully sequenced in its native RNA format by direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using Oxford Nanopore MinION technology [44]. Since then, studies have been performed for other viruses, confirming the potential of MinION technology to aid in the detection of infectious viral agents [45,46]. PRRSV whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been carried out previously using traditional Sanger sequencing [10] and next-generation short-read sequencing platforms [47]. Incorporating a bioinformatic approach, we systematically evaluated and standardized third-generation long-read MinION DRS for PRRSV whole genome generation and determined its ability to detect the viral strain present, its analytical sensitivity for strain-level diagnosis of clinical samples, and its feasibility for differentiation of co-existing multiple strains in a single sample. To our knowledge, our study is the first time PRRSV has been sequenced in its native RNA format without amplification. ",

The sequencing yield needed for viral strain detection was examined by generating datasets with targeted yields ranging from 3000 to 30,000,000 bases from the two whole genome sequencing runs. Specifically, the text summary of the sequencing file from basecalling was analyzed using R (version 3.4.0) [56] and groups with the desired yields were generated by setting a cutoff at the sequencing time in which the desired yield was reached. Examination of the number of viral copies needed in a sample in order to detect the virus was performed by sequencing viral RNA extracted from cell supernatant samples, spike-in samples, and clinical samples containing different amounts of virus. Because samples with a relatively low number of viral copies yielded low amounts of viral RNA, exogenous cellular RNA was added to achieve efficient library production. Following sequencing of the libraries containing both viral RNA and cellular RNA, the PRRSV sequences needed to be extracted for further analysis. First, a custom PRRSV sequence database containing 951 PRRSV whole genome sequences was generated by downloading all PRRSV whole genome sequences available in GenBank (949 sequences including our VR2332 strain, download date: Nov 2018) with the addition of sequences from our SDEU and 1-7-4 lab strains.

This is not surprising since the sequence adapter was ligated to the poly(A) tail on the 3\u2019 end and this is where sequencing began. If the RNA was partially degraded or RNA second structure hampered the movement of the RNA through the nanopores, then only the 3\u2019 end would be sequenced, thus resulting in uneven coverage distribution. Despite the uneven coverage, the accuracy across the genome was similar, around 95%, with the middle region of the genome having a higher accuracy (97%) and the 3\u2019 end having the lowest accuracy (93%) (Figure 2). This was surprising since higher coverage can correct random sequencing errors and usually results in higher accuracy, which would suggest the 3\u2019 end would have a much higher accuracy instead of a lower accuracy. Such conflicts imply the existence of technological bias resulting in sequencing errors that cannot be corrected by depth of coverage. A similar observation showing a lower accuracy proximal to the 3\u2019 poly(A) tail has been observed previously due to the DNA adapter, which can partially explain poor accuracy at the 3\u2019 end [41,59].

Thus, analytical sensitivity was next examined using samples with a more realistic amount of viral copies present. A total of 5 lower concentration cell culture samples, 3 serum samples with known amounts of virus spiked-in, and 6 clinical samples containing varying amounts of virus were sequenced. The total number of viral copies that were used for each MinION sequencing reaction was determined using RT-qPCR, with a range of 3.2 \u00d7 104 to 5.9 \u00d7 109 viral copies per sequencing reaction in these samples (Table 3). The PRRSV strain was determined by analyzing total raw reads from sequencing against the custom PRRSV database and the top BLAST match was used to identify the viral strain present in the sample (Table 3). MinION sequencing was able to detect PRRSV in spike-in samples containing as low as 3.4 \u00d7 104 viral copies and in clinical samples at 3.8 \u00d7 106 viral copies (Table 3). The analytical sensitivity difference related to sample type was unexpected, but, in fact, reasonable. One possible reason for this sensitivity difference could be related to viral RNA quality. Viral RNA extracted from cell culture supernatants are produced cleanly in a lab and are quickly stored properly to minimize viral and RNA degradation, thus giving higher quality samples. Clinical samples, on the other hand, are usually obtained on farm and the subsequent handling, shipping, and storage of clinical samples will inevitably increase viral and RNA degradation and decrease sample quality, resulting in lower sequencing yields, while RT-qPCR, which is less sensitive to these conditions, can still detect the presence of the virus [60].",

MinION sequencing produced a large number of total raw reads, most of which were from the added exogenous cellular RNA necessary for successful library preparation. The desired PRRSV reads were obtained through mapping raw reads against the custom PRRSV database and using those that matched to generate a consensus sequence. A consensus sequence was not able to be obtained for 2 of the samples (spike-in 3.4 \u00d7 104 viral copies and clinical 3.8 \u00d7 106 viral copies) because of the low number of PRRSV reads present, so the longest PRRSV read was used for accuracy analysis instead of a consensus sequence (Table 3). The accuracy of the consensus sequence (or longest PRRSV read) was determined by comparing it to the known whole genome and/or ORF5 sequence (Table 3). Not surprisingly, there was a general trend that longer and more accurate consensus sequences were generated when more viral copies were sequenced, with slight fluctuations due to variations in sequencer performance (Table 3). Notably, a basically full-length genome with a consensus accuracy of 93.0% was observed in the spike-in sample containing 1.5 \u00d7 109 viral copies (Table 3). The other three samples in which more than 109 viral copies were used as the input sample were also able to generate a consensus genome with an accuracy higher than 93%, but were not full-length genomes, perhaps due to the low number of PRRSV reads (and total reads) even though the percent of PRRSV reads per total reads was higher in these samples. Thus, more than 109 viral copies with perhaps 1500 PRRSV reads are recommended if the goal is to obtain a full-length genome sequence, but if identification of the viral strain involved in infection is all that is needed, then clinical serum samples need only have 106\u2013107 viral copies to be successful (Table 3).

Of note, the total raw reads varied greatly even though the same amount of total RNA was used for library preparation (Table 3), which was mainly due to the variation of flow cell performance, such as available pores. In order to normalize the comparison, the ratio of PRRSV reads to total reads was calculated and compared to the input viral copies and a strong positive correlation (r2 = 0.88) was observed. This preliminary result suggests that the knowledge of the number of viral copies in a sample can predict the approximate number of raw reads that will be obtained after sequencing allowing for more successful sequencing results and the number of reads obtained from sequencing can be used to estimate the number of viral copies present in a sample.",

            "text": "In swine farms, PRRS outbreaks can occur even in herds that are vaccinated, therefore it is necessary to be able to differentiate the presence of infectious field strains from vaccine to aid in outbreak investigation [13,14,16]. To address this issue, we explored the use of MinION DRS for detection of multiple PRRSV strains in the same sample using a stepwise BLAST approach. Samples were created that contained the VR2332 strain (parental strain to the type 2 PRRSV MLV vaccine) to represent vaccine, and either a type 1 PRRSV strain (SDEU, 61.4% similarity with VR2332) or another type 2 PRRSV strain (1-7-4, 82.4% similarity with VR2332). After sequencing, PRRSV reads were extracted from total reads. PRRSV reads were BLAST analyzed against the custom PRRSV database to identify the top match strain and all PRRSV reads that were able to map to this strain were obtained. The unmapped reads were then BLAST analyzed a second time against the custom PRRSV database to identify the top match of these remaining sequences and they were then mapped to this second top match. If unmapped sequences remained, this pipeline was repeated to identify more than 2 PRRSV strains present in the sample. Results showed that even at a total sequence yield of 30 kb (20\u201326 PRRSV reads), MinION sequencing was able to identify a PRRSV strain with >99.9% identity to the input VR2332 strain (Table 4). The control samples did not identify a second PRRSV sequence present (at any sequence yield) which was promising, since VR2332 was the only virus present. In the mixed virus samples, the second viral strain was not detectable at a total yield of 30 kb. However, at 300 kb or higher yields (245 or more PRRSV reads), the second strain could be identified with an accuracy >99.8% (Table 4). Thus, if enough virus is present from both strains, they could be successfully detected in a single sample. Interestingly, in the VR2332 + 1-7-4 sample, SDEU sequences were also detected, which was not expected since that strain was not present in the sample. Previously, others have observed between-run carryover contamination on the same MinION flowcell [61,62]. Our observation also indicates the carryover contamination from our previous VR2332 + SDEU sample sequencing. This reiterates the need for effective washing of flow cells, as well as good records of what was run on each flow cell previously, especially if flow cells are used for diagnostics. Further investigation into the SDEU carry over contamination showed that SDEU reads were consistently generated during the entire sequencing run, thus contaminating reads could not be minimized by removing the first few minutes of sequencing, they contaminated the entire sequencing run. Although this experiment was designed to differentiate field strains from vaccine strain, it can be applied to the investigation of multiple co-infection strains. Since the identification of the strains present is based on the top BLAST match, any strain with a known genome or similar genome to one in the database could be identified. If no similar strains are present in the database there should be a higher than usual percent of unmapped reads indicating a problem with the BLAST match parameters. The strains examined here were present in equal amounts and had at least an 82.4% identity. Further investigation of strains at different ratios and with higher identity to each other needs to be examined to determine if they would both be able to be distinguished, but with an adjustment of the minimap parameters used to map reads to the top BLAST hit, they should be able to be observed.",

Control of PRRSV is difficult, but important for animal welfare and swine production, where the development and implementation of reliable, accurate, and rapid diagnostic methods play a key role. Several methods have been developed and applied to PRRSV diagnosis, which are well described by Ko et al. [64]. Currently, PRRSV diagnostics mainly includes anti-PRRSV antibody detection by serological testing and nucleic acid detection using PCR based assays. Sequencing of PRRSV began in the mid-1990s, to discriminate between strains, which mainly focused on open reading frame 5 (ORF5) or other short regions of interest, but rarely encompassed the complete genome due to technological and monetary limitations [65,66]. PRRSV ORF5 shows extensive genetic diversity and has been used for providing insight into PRRSV epidemiology, however it is only 5% of the whole genome, thus 95% of the genomic information remains for prediction of genetic variation. Whole genome sequencing is greatly needed to provide a more complete picture of the virus [67,68], which is now gradually becoming more feasible with the rapid development and innovation of new sequencing technologies [69,70]. Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) is revolutionary for sequencing RNA viral genomes, since it can sequence the RNA directly, allowing for detection of methylation sites and decreasing bias inherent in reverse transcription and PCR amplification of samples prior to sequencing, and it can generate long reads, allowing for the elucidation of recombination events [71].

The key interests addressed in this study included whether sequencing can detect PRRSV strains to identify an outbreak as occurring due to the introduction of a new strain or recirculation of a previous outbreak, whether sequencing can generate whole genome information to aid in further understanding of PRRSV epidemiology, and whether sequencing can detect and differentiate multiple strains in a single sample to investigate outbreaks that occur in vaccinated herds or co-infection of multiple field-strains. Previously, PRRSV whole genomes have been generated using Sanger and Illumina sequencing technologies [10,47,72]. While both sequencing technologies can generate a whole PRRSV genome with more than 99.9% accuracy, the raw reads produced are usually less than 1500 bp. As a result, in order to generate a PRRSV whole genome, multiple primer sets and multiple individual sequencing reactions are needed for Sanger sequencing which is labor and time consuming; or for Illumina, computing resource intensive genome assembly is needed which requires time and knowledge to perform effectively. Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing, on the other hand, can generate ultra-long raw reads which are in theory only limited by input fragment length [73]. This feature is beneficial, since it saves time and effort when generating a whole genome sequence. In this study, we successfully generated PRRSV raw reads up to the length of the entire genome (15 kb) with an approximate 86% identity to the known input genome sequence. A bioinformatics approach was developed that used the longest raw read as a scaffold to effectively generate a consensus sequence, improving the accuracy to 96% identity of the input genome. ",

It has been reported that both Sanger and Illumina sequencing can accurately detect PRRSV strains present in a sample, but both require transcription of RNA into cDNA followed by PCR amplification prior to sequencing [10,72]. Differing from this, MinION technology directly sequences RNA strands for detection of PRRSV strains. This feature is beneficial since no reverse transcription or PCR are needed thus eliminating biases that those introduce and saving time since extra steps need not be performed, which allows for same day disease investigation. Moreover, direct RNA sequencing allows for the detection of nucleotide analogs which have been correlated with numerous diseases [74]. Most importantly, the MinION sequencer is cost-effective and easily accessible, without the investment of expensive sequencing and bioinformatics infrastructure. Despite the low raw read accuracy of direct RNA sequencing (~86%), which is the main concern with this technology, PRRSV strains were identified with 99.9% accuracy using as few as 5 raw reads (3 kb total yield). This accurate strain-level detection, even though the sequence accuracy is low, allows for guidance on determining effective control methods due to the precise detection of the circulating strains on a farm.

            "text": "Now knowing the potential of DRS for strain level detection of pathogens as determined through this study as well as others [75], we next investigated the analytical sensitivity of PRRSV detection to determine its usefulness for obtaining reliable sequencing results. Previous research examining analytical sensitivity of next-generation sequencing has reported sensitivities that are similar or less sensitive than RT-qPCR [28,76], and the third-generation Oxford Nanopore DRS has previously shown a sensitivity of 1.89 \u00d7 107 viral copies in an influenza virus study [44]. Our results indicated that samples with a minimum of 104 to 106 viral copies, depending on the sample type, can be successfully sequenced to accurately identify strains after about 6 hours of sequencing. Although DRS is not as sensitive as PCR for use as a diagnostic tool identifying viral presence [77,78], it can be used for further investigation of the strain causing an outbreak, either directly from high viral load samples or following amplification of virus in cell culture. Additionally, a very strong correlation was observed between the number of viral reads generated through sequencing and the starting number of viral copies, indicating sequencing reads can be predicted by viral copies in a sample and vice versa, which has been confirmed by other studies as well [28]. Interestingly, the observation that the sensitivity of sequencing was higher from cell culture virus spiked into serum as opposed to clinical serum samples suggests that sample handling or perhaps the quality of the sample was an important factor for sequencing sensitivity [79], thus emphasizing the importance of careful handling, transporting, and storing of clinical samples to protect the viral RNA from degradation [80,81]. This also suggests that on-site sequencing of samples as opposed to a centralized diagnostic system may allow for higher sensitivity of detection due to the ability to immediately process samples after sampling.",

In order to address this issue, Oxford Nanopore DRS was evaluated to determine if it could be used to discriminate co-infection by two PRRSV strains from different genotypes (61.4% similarity) as well as from the same genotype (82.4% similarity) in a single sample. In fact, the strains were easily differentiated, and the same method could be used to identify more than 2 strains present in a single sample.",

Knowledge gained from PRRSV in this study can be immediately translatable to aid in rapid diagnostic detection and strain-specific identification of an entire class of important swine pathogens. In fact, MinION sequencing technology might end up being a useful and affordable diagnostic tool for swine veterinary medicine in general.
