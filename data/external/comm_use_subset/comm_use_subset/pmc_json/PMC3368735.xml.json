From January to mid September 2011 52.940 Campylobacter infections have occurred in Germany alone [2]. Although infections predominantly result in mild self-limiting gastroenteritis, in some cases severe post-infection ramifications have been reported with the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome the major contributor [3]. The main route of infection and transmission is believed to be the incorrect handling and incomplete cooking of poultry. In fact, studies mention 62% of poultry carcasses to be contaminated with Campylobacter after slaughter [4].",

Although several genomic typing methods exist [5,6] these are often time-consuming and laborious. In comparison, a rapid point-of-care device would need a more direct approach like the presence of antigens which react swiftly with specific antibodies. For many pathogens several different methods based on the antigen-antibody-reaction are already commercially available, e.g. Latex-Agglutination-Tests [7]. However, the knowledge of antigens for pathogens is often limited. Traditionally, testing for immunogenic proteins has been carried out by screening of expression libraries using nitrocellulose membranes [8]. Despite its simplicity, this method has a key shortcoming regarding bacterial proteins. The elucidation of novel antigens is extremely difficult as a result of the high cross-reactivity of polyclonal antibodies against the host bacterium of the library [9]. Therefore, a high number of false positives occur, which hinder a fast and successful search for new antigens.",

All eleven genes that were successfully amplified showed the correct length (see Figure 3) and were subsequently cloned to KRX single-step competent cells. The correct insert size was determined by Colony PCR. Plasmids from clones containing the correct-sized inserts were isolated and the MCS was sequenced using both a forward and a reverse primer (HT7 For and Flexi R). During cloning an extra GTT, which encodes for a valine residue in the proteins' primary structures, was inserted immediately prior to each stop codon. As a universal stop codon TAA was used, replacing other stop codons if present. This was mainly done to gain maximum flexibility during cloning as the Flexi vector system enables the direct transfer to other vectors with different tags. A GTT is mandatory to later transfer the gene of interest to a vector encoding a C-terminal tag.",

However, as these bands bear similar sizes as the investigated fusion proteins, a secure identification of true positives is difficult at best using standard western blot without previous purification methods. Even then identification of immunogenicity is sometimes difficult at best as sensitivity might be low due to differences in expression rate and losses of protein content during purification. Still, the signal intensities of the five immunogenic proteins were well represented by all three methods - microarray, western blot and dot blot, as those with highest contrast values, namely cjaA, hisJ and peb1a, have also shown bands in western blot and signals in dot blot albeit lower for peb1a. In contrast, pal failed to generate a positive signal during microarray experiments and this result could be confirmed by western blot and dot blot. For flaC no band is visible in western blot and the signal in dot blot is extremely weak, yet our microarray method has identified the protein as being immunogenic, which has been reported elsewhere. A possible explanation for this is the high sensitivity of microarrays. This is well in accordance to Ekins \"ambient analyte theory\" [26] which has been the basic concept of microarrays for several decades. Thus, the microarray method might well be superior for immunoassays than common blotting methods.",

The usage of pFN18A Flexi vector in combination with KRX cells offers various advantages. First, Flexi vectors inhabit several intriguing features. They encode a bacterial RNase - Barnase - which is only removed during successful cloning. If cloning fails, the Barnase remains intact and leads to cell death and no visible colonies on the plates.

It allows for statistical and mathematical analysis of the data compared to nitrocellulose membranes illuminating proteins with different strength in their immunogenic ability. Further, the choice of our expression host - KRX - and the HaloTag\u00ae have brought other benefits, as well. The expression is tightly regulated, offers high yields and the covalent attachment of the proteins to the surface makes separate purification obsolete as it combines spotting and purification directly. The overall time frame from cultivation to screening is roughly 30 hours, whereas immunoscreening on nitrocellulose membranes [8] takes at least 3 days. The benefit of low turn-around time increases, when taking the cloning into consideration. Normally, cloning to recombinant expressed proteins is first done in propagation cells such as JM109 or DH5\u03b1 and afterwards a second cloning procedure to expression cells as BL21(DE3) is performed. With KRX single-step cells both propagation and expression can be performed sequentially avoiding time-consuming plasmid preparations and additional cloning steps.",

This method ought to become an attractive alternative to traditional methods for immunoscreening as it features several unique advantages. It provides a low turn-around time, significantly reduces background and false positive signals and enables high-throughput screenings of expression libraries or other sources of hundreds and thousands of different clones. With our results we were able to show the great potential of this method in future full proteome screenings as an attractive alternative to other broad screenings. Its major advantages being the complete deletion of cross-reactivity to proteins of the expression host as these are simply washed off after spotting. Thus an additional purification step, which is usually performed in microarray-based screening approaches of expression libraries or proteome analysis before immobilization to Nitrocellulose slides [32], becomes obsolete. Therefore, this method might decrease time and material costs associated with extensive screenings of libraries.
