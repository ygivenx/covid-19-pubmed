Such diffusion-induced instability can also take place in multiplex reaction networks (1)-(2). This phenomenon can be explained through a linear stability analysis with non-uniform perturbations. We introduce small perturbations,  and , to the uniform steady state, as follows: (ui,vi) = (u0,v0) + (\u03b4ui, \u03b4vi).

We clearly see that the uniform steady state is always a solution of the multiplex system. It is linearly stable (green line) for small values of k(v). But at some critical value of k(v) which satisfies equation (3), the system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation (red point) and becomes unstable (magenta line). Two new branches of solutions arise from the transcritical bifurcation. The unstable branch (magenta line) undergoes a second bifurcation (blue point), this time a saddle-node, giving rise to a new branch of stable solutions (green line) different from the uniform steady state. Figure 2b shows the transcritical (red line) and the saddle-node bifurcation (blue line) in the k(v)-k(u) plane. The curve of the transcritical bifurcation is given by equation (3), while the curve of the saddle-node bifurcation has been derived by numerical continuation. One can see from equation (3) that by increasing k(v), the boundary curve (red line) asymptotically approaches k(u) = fu/\u03c3(u). This indicates that the instability can be observed if a node has sufficiently large k(v), while its cunterpart has degree k(u) less than the value mentioned above. This fact reveals an important difference from the classical Turing instability, which always takes place by increasing \u03c3(v) irrespective of \u03c3(u)26.",

Such a pattern cannot develop from pairs of nodes possessing degrees in the grey area of Fig. 2b, where only the uniform state exists. However, pairs of nodes with degrees in the yellow area, beyond the transcritical bifurcation, are unstable. Under small perturbations they can leave the uniform state, yielding the formation of a stationary non-uniform pattern.

The critical node denoted by the red star is the first to spontaneously leave the uniform state, as shown in Fig. 3b. Next, Fig. 3c,d show that the critical nodes denoted by the green and blue stars rapidly differentiate from the uniform state.

Each point of the diagram is the average of ten different implementations of G(v) with the same mean degree ; G(u) is fixed. We clearly see that the amplitude is zero; i.e., the uniform state is the only stable attractor of the system, for  smaller than a critical threshold . However, a more detailed look in the vicinity of this transition reveals that a number of different stationary patterns could be identified for the same parameter values. As an example, Fig. 4b shows the amplitudes in three simulations where different perturbations have been applied to the same sequence of multiplex networks. Starting from the uniform state with small perturbations, the instability occurs at some critical threshold, resulting in a small abrupt increase of amplitude. Different perturbations result in different values for the instability threshold.",

            "text": "Although the observed properties of the stationary patterns are similar to those found in simplex networks2627, the cause of destabilization of the uniform steady state is different. This cause is only characteristic of multiplex networks and lies in the relationship between k(v) and k(u) for a pair of nodes. Therefore, the purposeful design of nonequilibrium patterns should be possible by tuning the architecture of the multiplex structure. Recently, new algorithms for building multiplex networks with positive or negative degree correlations across the layers have been proposed43444546. Using these algorithms, we can design multiplex networks where the onset of instability is controlled by tuning the degrees k(v) and k(u), and the source of instability can be located at any desired pair of nodes i(v), i(u).",

In ecological multiplex networks, for example, pairs of nodes might represent separate habitat patches which communicate through dispersal connections. However, prey and predators may use different connections (such as forest paths, rivers and tributaries or various transportation systems) to move among the fragmented habitats. Often, predators have more choices to move; in our representation their layer is more densely connected than the prey\u2019s layer. This is exactly the sort of situation that favors the Turing-like instability and the subsequent establishment of Turing patterns. Considering that self-organized patterns can be found in real ecosystems89 it is possible that such patterns can also be observed in natural ecological systems for which the multiplex structure is innate.",
