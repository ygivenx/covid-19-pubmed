            "text": "Chronic cor pulmonale (CCP), a common type of heart disease, has become a rising major public problem that threatens people\u2019s health and quality of life around the world [1]. Although the term \u201ccor pulmonale\u201d is popular in the medical literature, there is presently no consensual definition [1\u20133]. World Health Organization (WHO) defined CCP as \u201chypertrophy of the right ventricle resulting from diseases affecting the function and/or structure of the lungs, and may further leading to heart failure\u201d [4]. Pulmonary hypertension resulting from disorders of the respiratory system and/or from chronic hypoxaemia is the main pathological mechanism of CCP [1,5,6]. Currently, the conventional treatment, including antibiotics, vasodilators, expectorants, antiasthmatic drugs, diuretics and antiarrhythic drugs etc. is the main clinical therapy for CCP [1]. However, it is universally acknowledged that long-time use of western medicine sometimes may cause drug resistance and toxic side effects, and therefore its clinical efficacy is still unsatisfactory [1,2]. Many researchers in China and some other Asian countries indicated that the combination of Chinese and Western medicine for CCP might be the potential trend of clinical treatment development in future [7\u201312].",

            "text": "Ginkgo leaf extract and dipyridamole injection (GLED) is a compound Chinese herbal medicine, which mainly consists of ginkgo flavone glycosides (24\u201325%), terpene lactones [ginkgolides (3.1%) and bilobalide (2.9%)] and dipyridamole (10%) [13\u201315]. Ginkgo leaf extract has been proved to be an antioxidant and free radical scavenger, an inhibitor of the platelet-activating factor, a vasodilator, and a regulator of metabolism [14\u201317]. The therapeutic effect mechanism of GLED on CCP included its ability to scavenge free radicals, reduce inflammation and platelet aggregation while regulating vasodilation and glucose and lipid metabolism [16]. Furthermore, GBE affects vasomotor functions by modulating the synthesis of vasoactive substances including nitric oxide and endothelin [16]. GLED is a combination of Ginkgo leaf extract and dipyridamole (a kind of anti-thrombus and vasodilator drug) [18], and has the pharmacological characteristics of both. GLED has been considered as a promising supplementary treatment option for cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease and pulmonary disease due to its unique biological characteristics [13\u201317]. Tan et al. [14] reported that GLED (10\u201340 ml/day per day via intravenous infusion) could relieve the incidence of angina pectoris and improve the hemorheology index of patients with coronary artery disease. Xue et al. [15] showed that the clinical application of GDI (10\u201340 ml/day per day via intravenous infusion) not only obviously enhanced the overall response rate of conventional treatments, but also effectively improved the blood viscosity and blood lipid level of ischemic stroke patients.",

Compared with conventional treatments alone, GLED combined with conventional treatments was associated with obviously higher MER and TER. Moreover, because of chronic hypoxia, patients with CCP will suffer from oxygen free radicals metabolism imbalance, increased blood viscosity and pulmonary artery pressure, and further lead to the right heart dysfunction and even failure [1\u20134]. Our analysis results showed that the blood gas and hemorheology indexes of patients were also significantly ameliorated after conventional treatments and GLED combined therapy. All these results indicated that GLED can improve the cardiopulmonary function of CCP patients effectively, which may be related with its action on regulating the blood viscosity and blood gas indexes. To further confirm whether some variable factors affect the therapeutic effects of GLED for CCP. We used four clinical variables (GLED dosages, duration of treatment, sample sizes of involved studies, and manufacturer of GLED) to interact with two outcome indicators (MER and TER) and found that the MER and TER might be associated with manufacturer of GLED. However, given that only one study [50] reported the use of GLED produced by Tonghua Guhong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., therefore it is not enough to draw a definitive conclusion at present.",

The most common side effects during GLED therapy were nausea, headache, dizziness, abdominal distention, pruritus and skin rash, and the total adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups. Therefore, GLED is a relatively safe auxiliary medicine for CCP. However, evidence was limited to make a conclusion on safety evaluation because only 10 studies mentioned the adverse events.",

            "text": "There are some limitations in our analysis. First, as an important Chinese herb preparation, GLED was mainly applied in China or other Asian countries, which may bring the unavoidable regional bias and subsequently influence the clinical application of GLED worldwide. Second, the duration of treatment ranged from 7 to 28 days among the included studies. All of the trials assessed the efficacy immediately after the termination of the treatment period. Therefore, the long-term effect of GLED for CCP still needs methodologically rigorous trials to verify. Third, the main pathological features of CCP are pulmonary artery pressure, progressive of right ventricular hypertrophy and cardiopulmonary functional insufficiency. Many key variables, such as number of exacerbation, heart and lung function, quality of life, which closely related to survival, are not evaluated in these studies. Therefore, it is not yet possible to draw a conclusion on important outcomes. Moreover, GLED is a mixture that consists of more than one effective component, in this case, the mechanism of GLED may be complex and has multiple targets, and also this limits the usage of it. Fourthly, the administration conditions (extract/distill methods, storage conditions, dripping speed, GLED dosages and manufacturer, et al.) might be related with the efficacy of GLED mediated therapy [61,62]. In order to achieve the clinical therapeutic effect and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions of GLED mediated therapy to the greatest extent, it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of clinical medication to standardize the rational medication. The GLED in all included trials was approved by Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), and granted the Manufacturing Approve Number issued by Chinese SFDA (Supplementary Table S2). Based on currently available literatures, we have conducted subgroup analysis according to different GLED dosages and manufacturer. However, there are insufficient data to perform a statistical analysis to evaluate the impacts of other variable factors (extract/distill methods, storage conditions and dripping speed, et al.) on the treatment effect of GLED. We will keep following up with upcoming clinical trials to obtain relevant data when available. Finally, allocation concealment and blind method were not clear in most included studies, which may results in exaggerated estimates of treatment effect. Given the limitations mentioned above, all the findings from our study should be dealt with some caution.",
