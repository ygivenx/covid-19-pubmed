            "text": "Regardless of the underlying etiology, tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a common mechanism in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease [1], [2]. This progressive pathway involves interstitial infiltration by inflammatory mononuclear leukocytes [1], [3]. Integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1: \u03b1L\u03b22 integrin) is the predominant integrin on leukocytes and an important molecule in firm adhesion and migration of leukocytes to inflammatory sites [4], [5]. LFA-1 also plays pivotal roles as a signal transduction molecule by binding its ligand, namely, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) [6], [7]. Normally, LFA-1 is expressed in a low-affinity state for its ligand and, thus, cells do not make unnecessary adhesive contacts while in circulation [8], [9]. The affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 is mediated by a conformational change of LFA-1 and they play essential roles in most inflammatory reactions [8], [9]. ICAM-1 has been reported to be expressed on renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and the expression of ICAM-1 on RTECs was found to be associated with the infiltration of leukocytes in CKD [10], [11]. An experimental animal study showed that ICAM-1 was promptly up-regulated after renal injury and leukocyte infiltration subsequently occurred [12]. Kelly et al. reported that anti-ICAM-1 mAb mitigated leukocyte infiltration in tubulointerstitial space in an ischemic renal injury animal model [13]. Although these results suggested that ICAM-1 on RTECs and LFA-1 on leukocytes have some roles in the progression of renal diseases, the pathogenetic roles of their direct interaction in renal fibrosis remain unclear.",

Next, we investigated the effect of CCL3 and CXCL12 of HK-2 cells on the LFA-1 activation on HK-2 cells.

CXCL12 knockdown (CXCL12 KD) HK-2 cells did not increase CXCL12 expression regardless of TGF-\u03b21 stimulation.

Then, the changes of epithelial cell junction markers and mesenchymal markers on HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (0.1)-PBMCs were investigated by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting analysis. HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-\u03b21 (0.1 ng/ml) without co-culture with PBMCs (HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (0.1)) and HK-2 cells without stimulation of TGF-\u03b21 co-cultured with PBMCs (HK-2-PBMCs) were investigated as control experiments.

            "text": "The present study showed that the TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT on HK-2 cells was accelerated by PBMCs. The decrease of expression level of epithelial cell junction markers and increase of expression level of mesenchymal markers on HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-\u03b21 were accelerated by co-culture with PBMCs. These EMT marker changes on HK-2 cells were mitigated by anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-ICAM-1 mAb. These results demonstrated that the direct interaction of LFA-1 on PBMCs and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells contributed to accelerate TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT on HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells stimulated by TGF-\u03b21 induced conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs; however, HK-2 cells without stimulation by TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b21 alone did not induce conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs. The locally secreted chemokines can trigger integrin-dependent adhesion of circulating leukocytes that leads to infiltration [19], [20], [21], [22]. Several studies have characterized the expression pattern of chemokines in animal models of tubulointerstitial disease [23], [24], [25]. They demonstrated that various chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 are expressed only in the diseased compartment of the kidney and renal chemokine expression has been found to correlate with the leukocyte accumulation area and renal damage [23], [24], [25], [26]. On the basis of these findings, we investigated the regulation of the chemokines that may mediate LFA-1 activation of PBMCs on HK-2 cells by the stimulation of TGF-\u03b21. CCL2 decreased on HK-2 cells by stimulation of TGF-\u03b21. This result was consistent with a previous study [27]. CCL3 and CXCL12 increased on HK-2 cells by TGF-\u03b21 stimulation. CCL21 did not change on HK-2 cells by TGF-\u03b21 stimulation. CCL3, CCL4, CCL17, CCL19, CCL20 and CCL22 were not detected on HK-2 cells either before or after TGF-\u03b21 stimulation. CCL3 and CXCL12 were reported to activate LFA-1 on both monocytes and lymphocytes [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. In the present study, not CCL3 but CXCL 12 contributed to induction of the conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs, because less AL57-positive cells were detected among PBMCs after co-culture with CXCL12 knockdown HK cells compared with those among Mock, CCL3 knockdown and control knockdown HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, the EMT marker changes of HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 and morphological changes upon co-culture with PBMC were inhibited by CXCL12 knockdown on HK-2 cells (Figures S2 and S3). These results suggested that CXCL12 was a key chemokine for EMT of RTECs that induced TGF-\u03b21 accelerated by PBMCs.",

TGF-\u03b21 concentrations of the co-culture media of HK-2 cells and PBMCs were about threefold up-regulated compared with those of HK-2 cells without PBMCs.

We conducted real-time RT-PCR to detect the change of the TGF-\u03b21 mRNA in the HK-2 cells that underwent EMT and PBMCs in the lower plate separately at several time points after co-culture; however, we could not detect up-regulation of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA in both these HK-2 cells and PBMCs (data not shown).

In the present study, the phosphorylation of smad2 and smad3 was not detected in HK-2 cells by the stimulation of TGF-\u03b21 for 24 hrs before and after co-culture with PBMCs. This lack of phosphorylation of smad2 and smad3 is considered to be due to the low concentration of TGF-\u03b21 (0.1 ng/ml) because phosphorylation of smad2 and smad3 on HK-2 cells was detected after stimulation with higher concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 (10.0 ng/ml) for 24 hrs (data not shown). Xie et al. reported that the activation of ERK pathway was required for TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT of RTECs [34]. Schramek et al. reported that long-term ERK1/2 activation was an important mechanism involved in the EMT of HK-2 cells [35], [36]. In addition to the role of ICAM-1 as an adhesion molecule, ICAM-1 also has roles as a signal transduction molecule [37], [38], [39]. With the interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 and the formation of ICAM-1 multimers within the cell membrane, signal transduction is initiated [40], [41]. ICAM-1 with associated proteins such as Grb2, SOS and Shc can lead to downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, including ERK1/2 [38], [42]. The ERK1/2 proteins were most commonly activated through ICAM-1 ligation [38], [40]. In the present study, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was detected on HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-\u03b21 co-cultured with PBMCs. This phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was blocked by anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-ICAM-1 mAb. These results suggested that ERK 1/2 may be activated through ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells by the interaction of ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells and LFA-1 on PBMCs. LFA-1 also acts as a signal transduction molecule when it binds ligands [7]. Although ICAM-1 expression still showed a high level in HK-2 cells by TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, its suppression by TGF-\u03b21 might be an inhibition factor for EMT of HK-2 cells by the interaction of ICAM-1 of HK-2 cells and LFA-1 of PBMCs. Further study will be needed to investigate the mechanism and significance of the regulation of ICAM-1 expression, the signaling pathway that affects EMT of HK-2 cells on PBMCs by the interaction of LFA-1 on PBMCs and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells.",

Although snail and slug signaling and a-SMA expression significantly increased in HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (10), they did not increase in HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (0.1)-PBMCs at 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs, the same as HK-2-PBMCs and HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (0.1). Furthermore, the migration of HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (10) significantly increased at 72 hrs and 96 hrs with a transient decrease at 48 hrs; however, that of HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (0.1)-PBMCs did not change compared with those of Mock, HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs at 72 hrs and 96 hrs with a transient decrease at 48 hrs. Although the invasion of HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (10) also increased at 96 hrs with a transient decrease at 48 hrs, that of HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (0.1)-PBMC did not change compared with those of Mock, HK-2-TGF-\u03b21 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs at 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs. These results suggested that TGF-\u03b21 (0.1) is not sufficient to induce EMT of RTECs and the interaction of LFA-1 of PBMCs and ICAM-1 of RTECs pre-stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (0.1) contributed to the early part of EMT of RTECs. Taking these findings together, the low level of TGF-\u03b21 that could not induce EMT of RTECs by itself may contribute to EMT of RTECs by inducing the interaction of ICAM-1 of RTECs and LFA-1 on PBMCs, leading to activation of the signaling through ICAM-1 and self-sustained activation of TGF-\u03b21 on RTECs.\n",

A large proportion of the interstitial fibroblasts in fibrotic kidneys have been reported to originate from proximal tubular cells in an animal model [16]. Clinical studies utilizing human kidney biopsies also suggest that EMT plays a role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis [43], [44], [45]. Furthermore, EMT of RTECs was well correlated with declining renal function [43], [45]. The renal fibrosis also involved interstitial infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear leukocytes [3]. Thus, our finding suggested that inflammatory mononuclear leukocytes contributed to renal fibrosis by accelerating EMT of RTECs.",
