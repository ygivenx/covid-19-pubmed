            "text": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme presenting in the cytoplasm of human cells that participates in the pentose phosphate pathway and supplies reducing energy by maintaining levels of the co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) [1]. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked inheritance. G6PD gene consists of 13 exons with approximately 18kb and is situated on the distal long arm of X chromosome (Xq28). About 180 mutations of G6PD gene have been reported resulting in protein variants with different levels of enzyme activity. NADPH is essential for both oxidant and antioxidant systems of cells. In the antioxidant pathway, NADPH maintains the reduced form of glutathione to protect cells from oxidative damage [2]. This reduction in cells causes accumulation of redox oxidative species (ROS) and leads to senescence [1] and haemolysis in red blood cell [3]. On the other hand, NADPH is also involved in the oxidant pathway to produce ROS. Although the overproduction of these ROS may adversely affect cell function, cells of immune system also need these reactive species to kill invading organisms. Phagocytes of the immune system need these reactive species to kill invading pathogens as part of the innate immune system. In cases of severe G6PD deficiency, the lack of oxidative metabolism can cause a reduction in oxygen-dependent phagocytosis as observed in chronic granulomatous disease [4] and allows for viral replication [5\u20138].",

How patients\u2019 genetic background affects the development of severe infection has become an area of interest. G6PD deficiency is one of the reported genetic variants associated with infections [8, 21]. In vitro studies reported that monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals had increased susceptibility to dengue virus serotype 2 infections along with higher viral replication [5, 6]. Whether higher replication of dengue virus in G6PD-deficient individuals increases the likelihood of disease severity remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the association between G6PD deficiency and severity of dengue infection in paediatric patients in Myanmar.",

Written informed consent and verbal assent were taken from caregivers and children, respectively. Three millilitres of blood were taken, and sera were tested for the NS1 antigen as well as for IgM and IgG antibodies using the SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (Standard Diagnostics, Korea). Patients with a positive NS1 antigen and/or dengue IgM result were enrolled. Patients who had a diagnosis other than dengue, such as co-infections and immunocompromised status (e.g., steroid use, chemotherapy, and/or positive HIV status) were excluded. Patients were followed 1\u20133 weeks after admission for convalescent serum sample collection. Complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count (RC) and G6PD activity were measured within 24 hours after collection of acute sera. G6PD activity was assessed via spectrophotometry (Randox Laboratory, UK). The adjusted median value of G6PD activity for males in our cohort was used to define various cut-off points [22]. Dengue severity was classified according to the 2009 WHO classification guidelines [23]. Both acute and convalescent samples were stored at -80\u00b0C prior to further testing.",

Warning signs included abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed, lethargy/restlessness, liver enlargement > 2cm and increase in haematocrit (\u2265 44%) concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count (<100 \u00d7 103 per \u03bcl).

The result of this study is consistent with two earlier studies conducted in Thailand [28, 29]. Tanphaichitr and colleagues did not demonstrate a correlation between G6PD deficiency and dengue severity in 89 male paediatric patients (age range: 1\u201313 years) with dengue haemorrhagic fever age. In this study, 17 out of 72 patients had G6PD deficiency [28]. Seridhoranakul et al. also did not demonstrate a significant relationship between G6PD deficiency and DHF in a study with 80 DHF patients, in which 9 patients were G6PD-deficient, and 131 controls, in which 13 patients were G6PD-deficient [29]. Tanphaichitr et al. reported a higher prevalence of G6PD deficiency in male DHF patients, which was 19.1% compared to 12% in Bangkok, and suggested that G6PD-deficient males may suffer more from DHF [28]. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency in paediatric patients with dengue infection in the present study was lower than the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in children visiting the Emergency Department of Yankin Children Hospital, ages: 1 month to 12 years old, who were screened for dengue via RDT (14.8% vs. 18.5%, respectively). In this study, G6PD deficiency was diagnosed if enzyme activity was < 60% of the adjusted median value, which was slightly lower than the adjusted median value in our study (3.24 U/g Hb vs. 3.42 U/g Hb) [30]. When comparing the results of these two studies, conducted in the same setting, G6PD-deficient children may not be more susceptible to dengue infection compared to children with normal G6PD activity.",

The findings from our study did not support this hypothesis. However, viral load was not assessed in our study, thus, the association of viral load or viral replication to clinical outcomes was beyond the scope of this study. The different dengue serotype also affects clinical outcomes. Although dengue serotypes were not assessed in this study, previous studies described that the prevalent serotype among patients with DHF in Myanmar in recent years was dengue serotype 1 [31, 32]. Additionally, all four serotypes participated in the 2015 outbreak [19]. The association between G6PD deficiency, viral load and different dengue serotypes warrant future studies.",

Bancone et al reported this molecular heterogeneity among this ethnicity along Thai-Myanmar border [35]. Six patients (1 male and 5 females) who had genotypic mutation had normal G6PD activities; all had reticulocyte count < 2%, excluding a false negative phenotype due to haemolysis. G6PD Mahidol is considered a moderately severe variant with varying G6PD activities which classifies it as WHO class II/III; almost all of male patients with Mahidol variant had enzyme activities < 10% (i.e. were class II). This finding is consistent with results of another study from the Thai-Myanmar border [35]. A significant association between G6PD mutation, in predominantly the Mahidol variant, and dengue infection was not found. Whether G6PD genotypes other than Mahidol could affect dengue severity cannot be excluded based on our current study. Thus, the effect of other G6PD gene mutations on dengue infection is unknown, and complementary studies should be performed in different populations.",
