Transferrin receptor (TfR), is required for the import of iron into the cell, and is regulated by intracellular iron concentration. It has also been reported to be a receptor for MEV, controlling the first step in the viral infection process. TfR can be considered a model for the endocytosis and recycling of receptor-ligand complexes: it is excluded from lipid raft domains in the plasma membrane and is taken up rapidly from the cell surface via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [1,19-24]. Since TfR plays an important role in MEV infection, we therefore investigated whether miRNAs participate in the host-virus interaction by modulating its activity.",

To test these miRNAs, F81 cells were transfected with the miRNA mimics and inhibitors, negative control (NC) mimics and inhibitors as controls. After 36 h, TfR mRNAs were quantified by qPCR. Results showed that miR-320a and miR140 mimics decreased TfR mRNA levels by almost 30% compared to NC mimics, and miR-320a inhibitors increased them approximately 25% (Figure 2A). After 48 h transfection as above, the quantity of TfR proteins were also examined by western blot and flow cytometry. Results showed that miR-320a and miR-140 downregulated the protein level (Figure 2B) and the percentage of TfR-positive cells by almost 20% and 30% respectively (Figure 2C). To further confirm the activity of the mimics, qPCR and western blot assay were used to show that the expression levels of TfR were reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1D,E). Altogether, these results clearly show that cellular miR-320a and miR-140 have negative effects on TfR expression.",

This was confirmed by qPCR which showed that both miRNAs gradually increased following MEV infection (Figure 3). To investigate whether upregulation of the two miRNAs following MEV infection could affect TfR expression, qPCR (Figure 3A,B) and western blot (Figure 3C) were performed simultaneously. As expected, TfR was gradually downregulated following MEV infection. To further ascertain that TfR downregulation is the result of miRNAs upregulation, F81 cells were transfected with miRNA inhibitors 12 h post MEV infection. Results showed that compared with transfection with NC inhibitors, both miR-320a and miR-140 inhibitors attenuated the inhibitory effect on TfR expression levels (Figure 3D).

After co-transfection of F81 cells with pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR and miR-320a or miR-140 mimics, the relative luciferase activity was measured. As predicted, both miR-320a and miR-140 significantly inhibited the relative luciferase activity (by more than half) in comparison with NC mimics (Figure 4B). To further ascertain the necessary function of complementary seed sequence, mut320a-pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR and mut140-pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR, with mutated tetranucleotides were constructed and the corresponding mut miR-320a and mut miR-140 mimics were synthesized (Figure 4A). As expected, after co-transfection of F81 cells, miR-320a and miR-140 mimics had no effect on the relative expression activity of the mutant reporter vector, but mut miR-320a and mut miR-140 mimics downregulated them by more than 2-fold (Figure 4C,D). To provide evidence for the physical interaction of the two miRNAs with TfR mRNA, immunoprecipitation with Argonaute 2 (Ago2) was performed. As previously described [35], both mRNA degradation and translation repression is dependent on RISC, in which the most important factor is Ago2 protein. Therefore, anti-Ago2 antibody was used to test if the two miRNAs and TfR mRNA were associated with Ago2. As expected, when Ago2 protein was specifically precipitated by anti-Ago2 antibody, as compared with normal IgG, TfR was enriched more than 3-fold by miR-320a and more than 2-fold by miR-140 after transfection with miR-320a or miR-140 mimics respectively, whereas following transfection with mut miR-320a or mut miR-140, TfR was not enriched (Figure 4E). Altogether, these results indicate that miR-320a and miR-140 target the 3\u2032UTR of TfR and physically bind to TfR mRNA in the RISC.",

Indeed, TfR has been established as a gatekeeper for regulating iron uptake by most cells, and the transferring-to-cell endocytic pathway has been characterized in detail [41]. TfR is central to the uptake of iron-loaded transferrin [42] which is post-transcriptionally regulated via iron-responsive elements present in its 3\u2032UTR [43]. In addition to its role in erythropoiesis, TfR is also overexpressed in the majority of malignancies [44] and is directly linked to cell proliferation [45-47]. Studies have demonstrated that parvovirus replication is dependent on host cellular division and proliferation ([48]; Tattersa [49]) and vigorous proliferative activity of host cells promotes parvoviral replication. Reduction in cellular metabolic activity, therefore, may explain why downregulation of TfR inhibits MEV replication. There may, however, be another mechanism. TfR is necessary for MEV uptake by host cells: downregulation may therefore render infected cells less susceptible to superinfection with additional MEV particles. While it may take only one virion to establish a primary infection, a multiply-infected cell may produce more infectious progeny. Downregulation of TfR on the cell surface, therefore, may result in diminished production of virus.",
