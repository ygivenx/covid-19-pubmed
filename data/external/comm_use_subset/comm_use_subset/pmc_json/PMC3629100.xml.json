The formation of the mammalian secondary palate requires several developmental steps, including growth, elevation, and midline fusion of the palatal shelves [2]. Two palatal shelves grow from the internal surfaces of the maxillary primordia once development of the secondary palate is initiated, and at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) in the mouse, they appear vertically on each side of the tongue. They subsequent elevate to a horizontal position above the tongue at E14.0 [2]. From E14.0 to E14.5, the palatal shelves make contact and start the fusion necessary for correct morphogenesis [3], and by E14.5 they are fused with one another from the middle region to the anterior and posterior regions to transform the medial edge epithelium (MEE) into the midline edge epithelial seam (MES) [4]. Ultimately, by E15.5, the MES is absent from the fused palate.",

In the fusion process, most studies have focused on the mechanisms responsible for the disappearance of the MES; there still remains considerable disagreement regarding the fate of the MES, such as : (A) apoptosis in the MES [7], (B) migration of the MEE resulting in loss of MES [8], and/or (C) epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of MES [9], [10], [11]. On the other hand, before the process of disappearance of the MES, epithelial adhesion of the MEE by each opposing palatal shelf is required. However, only a few studies have investigated the initial adhesion of palatal shelves [12].",

Both TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23 are normally expressed in the MEE cells of the palatal shelf during mouse palate development, whereas TGF\u03b22 is expressed in the mesenchyme beneath the MEE cells [15]. In Tgfb2-deficient (Tgfb2\u2212/\u2212) mice, some of the newborns (23%) exhibit cleft palate [16]. Tgfb3\u2212/\u2212 mice show complete phenotype penetrance of cleft palate (100%) [17]. The failure of palatal shelf fusion in Tgfb3\u2212/\u2212mice can be rescued by exogenous TGF\u03b23 in an in vitro organ culture system [14]. Subsequent studies indicate that TGF\u03b23 is required for the disappearance of the MEE by inducing programmed cell death [18]. Concerning its receptor, epithelial-specific conditional knockout of Tgfbr2 also resulted in partial cleft palate [19]. These two mouse models are useful to examine the mechanism of palatal fusion.",

Our results provide evidence that carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is expressed in a temporal manner in the palatal epithelia during palatal formation. CEACAM1 is displayed on epithelial cells of reproductive tissues such as the uterus, the breast, and the prostate [20]. In these tissues, CEACAM1 acts as a cell adhesion molecule, an angiogenic factor, a tumor suppressor, and a signal regulatory protein [21]. However, it has never been shown that CEACAM1 plays a role in craniofacial development, especially in palatogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate the role of CEACAM1 in the palatal adhesion process during palatal development.",

By E14.5, the medial edge epithelium (MEE) formed the midline edge epithelial seam (MES) during fusion [4]. At E15.0, the MES was disrupted, and epithelial islands were observed, which a complete disappearance at E15.5 after fusion. Here we showed that histological changes of palatal formation with suspension cultured were shown in Figure 1A\u2013F. The prefused each palatal shelves became to be close easily due to absence of tongue (Figure 1A, B). After attached the each palatal shelves, fusing process started. The MES was detected during fusion as well as normal pathogenesis at E14.5 (Figure 1C, D). It was taken for 60 h to completely disappear of MEE in the midline of palate (Figure 1E, F). Our suspension culture methods were clearly demonstrated the process of palatogenesis in ex vivo situation. In order to identify candidate molecules of palatal fusion, palatal tissues were dissected for microarray analysis as shown in the boxes areas of Figure 1B, D, F. Microarray analysis was performed to detect the gene expression of palatal tissues at various stages, including before, during, and after palatal fusion. The number of genes up-regulated and down-regulated more than 2-fold were 3663 and 2947, respectively. Large changes were seen in the expression of Krt13 (keratin 13), Ceacam1, Car3 (carbonic anhydrase 3), Fmo2 (flavin containing monooxygenase 2), Hdc (histidine decarboxylase), and Armc3 (armadillo repeat containing 3) (Table 1). One of the highly up-regulated genes was Ceacam1. CEACAM1 is known as an adhesion and angiogenic molecule. We chose to study this molecule further because epithelial cell adhesion is an extremely important process for the initiation of palatal fusion.",

After fusion, there were no epithelial components nor any CEACAM1 expression observed in the center of the palatal shelves. Thereafter, CEACAM1 was only expressed in the nasal and oral epithelium in the midline (Figure 3D). We further investigated the functional significance of CEACAM1 expression during palate formation using a suspension culture system. In this organ culture system, the function-blocking antibody mAb CC1 [25], [26] was added to the medium, and the palatal tissues were cultured for 60 h. Initial palatal adhesion and fusion were inhibited by antibody blocking of CEACAM1. Control (non-specific IgG) showed a normal high score of palatal fusion (79.8\u00b15.6%), whereas palatal fusion was significantly inhibited by mAb CC1 (48.3\u00b16.7%) (Figure 3E).

Although TGF\u03b2IIR is strongly expressed in both MEE and cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived palatal mesenchyme, mice deficient for the Tgfbr2 gene die on E10.5 as the result of defects in yolk sac hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis [27]. Conditional inactivation of Tgfbr2 in palatal epithelium using K14-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl mice revealed incomplete disappearance of the MEE and submucous cleft in palate formation [19]. Tgfb3\u2212/\u2212 mice also show the failure of palatal shelf fusion with 100 percent penetrance [17]. Subsequent studies indicated that TGF\u03b23 is required for the disappearance of MEE by inducing programmed cell death [18]. Additionally, it has been reported that TGF\u03b23 in palatal epithelium regulates cell-cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin during fusion of palatal shelves [28], [29]. Therefore, we investigated that whether CEACAM1 expression was changed in TGF\u03b2-deficient mice, which have defects in the disappearance of MEE. We compared wild-type mice at E14.5 to K14-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl mice at E15.5 and Tgfb3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice at E14.5. CEACAM1 expression was weakly observed in the MEE of anterior and posterior regions of palatal shelves in wild-type embryos (Figure 6A, B). Residual MES palatal epithelium was seen in K14-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl mutant embryos (Figure 6C, D). Interestingly, CEACAM1 was clearly expressed in the remaining palatal epithelium in K14-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl embryos. In Tgfb3\n\u2212/\u2212mice, the opposing palatal shelves were just attached at the midline of the developing palate (Figure 6F). CEACAM1 expression was also retained in the palatal epithelium and mesenchyme of palatal shelves (Figure 6E, F). To investigate the effect of TGF\u03b23 on CEACAM1 expression, exogenous TGF\u03b23 beads were placed in the organ culture undergoing palatal fusion. TGF\u03b23 did not directly affect the expression of CEACAM1 (data not shown).",

CEACAM1 expression is induced by VEGF. CEACAM1 contributes to endothelial cell tube formation (angiogenesis) as an additional effect of VEGF [33]. CEACAM1 is expressed in adherence junctions, and it supports cell adhesion and polarity [34]. CEACAM1 displays both homophilic adhesion (CEACAM1-CEACAM1) and heterophilic adhesion (CEACAM1-CEA) [35].
