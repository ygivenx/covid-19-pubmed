This is consistent with the ability of mAb 2H6 to bind to both avian H5N1 and seasonal IAVs28. In order to determine if the helix \u03b12 of H5N1-NS1(RBD) is sufficient for the interaction with mAb 2H6, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed by using a synthetic peptide H5N1-NS1-24mer corresponding to helix \u03b12. As shown in Fig. 1B, mAb 2H6 bound to H5N1-NS1-24mer in a dose dependent manner, indicating that the helix \u03b12 of NS1(RBD) is sufficient for its interaction with mAb 2H6. In contrast, there was no binding between mAb 2H6 and an irrelevant control peptide of similar molecular weight.",

Comparative ELISA showed that mAb 2H6 bound to NS1(RBD)-wild-type (WT) stronger than NS1(RBD)-N48S when different amounts of protein were coated on the plate and analyzed with 5 \u03bcg/ml of mAb 2H6 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, when a fixed amount of protein (125 \u03bcg/ml) was coated on the plate and analyzed with different concentrations of mAb 2H6, the binding to NS1(RBD)-N48S was significantly lower than NS1(RBD)-WT (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, when N was substituted with A at residue 48, the interaction between mAb 2H6 and NS1(RBD) was totally abolished in all the conditions tested (Fig. 2A,B). This result suggests that the difference at residue 48 is the main reason for the stronger binding of mAb 2H6 to H5N1-NS1(RBD) when compared to H1N1-PR8-NS1(RBD) (Fig. 1). Since both N48 and S48 are polar amino acids while A48 has no side chain, it is probable that the formation of hydrogen bonds is important for the interaction between mAb 2H6 and NS1.",

Thus, recombinant PR8 (rgPR8) viruses expressing the NS1 protein containing a single amino acid substitution at residue 48 (rgPR8-NS1-S48A and rgPR8-NS1-S48N) were generated using a reverse genetics system. Subsequently, A549 cells were infected with each virus at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 respectively and plaque assay was used to determine the amount of virus secreted at different time points post-infection. As shown in Fig. 3A, although the viral titer was slightly lower in the case of rgPR8-NS1-S48N infection, the overall growth rates of WT and mutant viruses were similar from 12 to 60 hours post-infection (h.p.i.).

When either 2H6-Fab or 1A9-Fab (which is derived from a negative-control antibody binding to the spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus)31 was transfected into A549 cells using Lipodin-Ab reagent, intracellular accumulation of Fab was observed even up to 24 h post transfection (Fig. 4A). The intracellular accumulation of Fab was also observed at as early as 4 h post transfection (data not shown). The transfection efficiency was about 70% and most of the Fab molecules were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm but there were some punctate staining which could be due to aggregation of Fab inside A549 cells. In contrast, no intracellular accumulation of Fab was observed when 1A9-Fab or 2H6-Fab was added to the cells without Lipodin-Ab reagent. As shown in Fig. 4B, the delivery of Fab did not have any significant effect on cell viability at either 12 or 24 h post transfection.",

As additional ELISA results showed that 3 residues, namely S42, R44, and G47, in NS1 are not involved in interaction with mAb 2H6 (Figure S1), this information was used to distinguish between the models in these 3 clusters. Of all energetically best models generated, 9 predicted models were grouped into cluster 2. The average buried surface area was 1670.7 \u00b1 52.6 \u00c52, and RMSD from the overall lowest-energy structure was 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5. Among them, the best predicted model from this cluster showed good agreement with our comparative ELISA data, since only residues N48 and T49 were predicted to be involved in the interaction, while the side chains of S42, R44 and G47 were either distal from the interface (S42 and R44) or inaccessible (G47) to the binding partner of 2H6-Fab (Fig. 5). By analyzing the polarity of the amino acids and distance between them in this model, it is predicted that residues N52 and N54 in the variable domain of heavy chain (VH)-complementarity determining region 2 (CDR2) of 2H6-Fab could form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of N48 in NS1(RBD). In addition, the side chain of T49 in NS1(RBD) could form hydrogen bonds with residue R57 in VH-CDR2. In contrast, VH-CDR1, VH-CDR3 and all the CDRs in the variable domain of light chain (VL) are unlikely to be involved in the interaction as they are distal to helix \u03b12 of NS1(RBD).",

To investigate whether mAb 2H6 hampers dsRNA-NS1 interaction in vitro, an AlphaScreen assay was carried out. In this experiment, glutathione S-transferease (GST)-tagged H5N1-NS1(RBD) protein, which was produced in E. coli, was incubated with synthetic 21-nucleotide siRNA (21nt-siRNA) followed by addition of streptavidin coated donor beads and anti-GST-conjugated acceptor beads which recognize biotinylated RNA and GST-tagged protein respectively. If the interaction between NS1 and 21nt-siRNA brings both beads to close proximity, transfer of excitation energy from donor beads into acceptor beads will yield a luminescent signal (Fig. 6A)35. When NS1(RBD) was pre-incubated with different concentrations of mAb 2H6 followed by addition of 21nt-siRNA, acceptor and donor beads, the luminescent signal decreased at high concentration of mAb 2H6 (Fig. 6B). The luminescent signal was reduced by ~30% and ~70% at mAb 2H6 concentrations of 1 and 5 \u03bcM respectively (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the binding of mAb 2H6 to NS1(RBD) can block the interaction of NS1 with dsRNA.

Thus, the interaction between T49 and 2H6-Fab predicted in the docked model is consistent with the ability of mAb 2H6 to inhibit the interaction between NS1 and dsRNA. Although a previous study has demonstrated that mutation at residue 48 did not affect the affinity of NS1(RBD) for dsRNA30, our study suggests that the side chain of N48 makes crucial contacts with mAb 2H6 to stabilize the antibody-antigen complex. As such, when the side chain is not present in the case of the N48A substitution mutant, interaction with mAb 2H6 is completely abolished (Figs 2 and 3). This indicates that the interaction between the side chains of residue T49 in NS1 and residue R57 in 2H6-Fab is not sufficient to maintain the antibody-antigen interface. On the other hand, the T49V and T49A substitution mutants still retained some binding to mAb 2H6 (Figure S1), presumably because of the hydrogen bonds between residue N48 and the heavy chain of the antibody.",

            "text": "Based the AlphaScreen assay, a high concentration of mAb 2H6 (~5 \u03bcM) was required to reduce the interaction between NS1(RBD) and dsRNA by >50% (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the concentration of mAb 2H6 required for binding NS1(RBD) in ELISA was in the nanomolar range (Fig. 2). This discrepancy could be due to the differences between the two assays but it also suggests that the binding of mAb 2H6 to NS1 could have other effects on NS1 besides disrupting its interaction with dsRNA. Indeed, our previous gel filtration and dynamic light scattering results suggest that the complex between 2H6-Fab and NS1(RBD) is multimeric in nature and each oligomer could consist of 6 molecules of NS1(RBD) and 6 molecules of 2H6-Fab29. In contrast, NS1(RBD) eluted out the gel filtration column as a dimer, as would be expected, in the absence of 2H6-Fab29. In addition, the delivery of 2H6-Fab into A549 cells also caused a reduction in the replication of rgPR8-NS1-S48N recombinant virus (Fig. 4). While it is difficult to precisely define the biologically relevant quaternary structures of NS1, several studies have shown that the NS1 has conformational plasticity and dynamic changes in the quaternary structure of NS1 are likely to be important for the different functions of NS1 in infected cells39. Hence, it is possible that the binding of 2H6-Fab to the NS1 expressed in infected A549 cells could affect the conformational plasticity of NS1 and/or its ability to interact with certain cellular factor, thus resulting in a reduction in viral replication. In future studies, advanced fluorescence microscopic techniques could be used to determine the effect of 2H6-Fab on the dynamic of NS1 inside infected cells.",

Our results showed that helix \u03b12 in NS1(RBD) is sufficient for interacting with mAb 2H6 and residues N48 and T49 in this helix are likely to make hydrogen bonds with the CDR2 of the antibody heavy chain. Helix \u03b12 is highly conserved and this is consistent with the ability of mAb 2H6 to bind to different subtypes of IAV. After solving a high resolution crystal structure of 2H6-Fab, a HADDOCK-derived model of the antibody-antigen complex has been obtained and the molecular contacts predicted from this model are in agreement with results obtained from comparative ELISA performed using NS1 mutants. This model may be used in antibody engineering experiments to increase the affinity of interaction between NS1 and mAb 2H6 so as to increase mAb 2H6\u2019s potency in viral inhibition. In addition, it may be useful in structure-based rational drug design to identify small molecule inhibitors of NS1.",
