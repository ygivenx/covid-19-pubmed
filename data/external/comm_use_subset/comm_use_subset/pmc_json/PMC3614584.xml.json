The antigen -capturing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (3) was established for the detection of anti-N protein antibody present in sera. A 100-\u03bcl volume of serum was added to the well coated with recombinant N protein, and the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. A 10-\u03bcl volume of labeled antigen was added,and the plate was incubated for another 30 min and washed as already described, and then 100-\u03bcl of TMB substrate solution (0.1mg of tetramethybenzidine hydrochloride/ml, 0.01% H2O2 in 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH5.8) was added,the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 \u03bcl of 2 N sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was determined.
