            "text": "In view of the issues discussed above, the present study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of widely-used measures of conspiracy ideation in Iran, a non-Western country with an interesting geopolitical position vis-\u00e0-vis conspiracist beliefs. Iran is a Muslim-majority country in Middle East, categorized as a high-development country in the latest United Nations Development Programme [26], and where Persian (or Farsi) is the official language. Although the study of conspiracy theories in Iran is limited, one early study by Zonis and Joseph [27] suggested that rapid social and cultural change in Iran meant that Iranians frequently resorted to conspiracy theories to account for new and contested realities. In their view, national and socio-cultural crises induced a \u201cregression in mental processes\u201d and facilitated the emergence of conspiracy theories [27]. These authors also speculated that child-rearing practices (e.g., the loss of dominant father figures) and the secrecy of sexuality in Iran heightened paranoid-like ideation, which in turn enhanced a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. Although some of this commentary may now be antiquated, it is also apparent that conspiracy theories enjoy mainstream audiences in Iran specifically and the Middle East more broadly [28]. Indeed, recent work has suggested that belief in conspiracy theories, particularly with regards to international relations, Zionism and the creation of Israel, Western military intervention in the Middle East, and oil pricing, may be particularly charged in the Iranian context [29\u201330]. Thus, Iran is an interesting cultural setting for scientific investigations of conspiracy theories, but such work will need to be predicated on appropriate psychometric measures of conspiracist beliefs.",

[19], we expected that the BCTI and CMQ would reduce to one-factor models, whereas the Persian GCBS would reduce to a two-factor model. In addition, we also conducted an assessment of the construct validity of these measures by investigating associations with education, schizotypal personality, information processing style, superstitious beliefs, religiosity, and political orientation. Each of these constructs was selected as being appropriate for the estimation of construct validity based on established associations with conspiracist beliefs in previous studies (see above). Evidence of construct validity would be provided through significant and moderate-to-strong positive correlations between scores on the adapted measures of conspiracist ideation and schizotypal personality, intuitive information processing style, superstitious beliefs, rightist political orientation, and religiosity. On the other hand, we hypothesized the scores on the aforementioned measures of conspiracy beliefs would be negatively and moderately-to-strongly correlated with education and analytical information processing style. More broadly, by including these additional measures, we were able to examine the extent to which the associations between conspiracist beliefs and proposed correlates would be replicated in a new cultural context.",

Participants rated each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale, from 1 (Completely false) to 5 (Completely true). Higher scores indicate stronger self-reported preference to use the respective thinking style (i.e., intuitive-experiential vs. analytical-rational). Rezaei [41] subjected the Persian translation of the 40-item REI to exploratory factor analysis in an Iranian sample and retained 22 items of the REI-40. Therefore, we used the 22-item Persian REI, but further discarded items with low inter-item and item-total correlations, which resulted in 8 items for intuitive-experiential subscale (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .80) and 6 items for analytical-rational subscale (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .82).",

Once ethics approval was obtained from the relevant university ethics committee, we prepared Persian translations of the BCTI, CMQ, and GCBS from the parent English versions using the standard back-translation technique [42]. We, then, administered the translations to 30 students at the University of Tehran and asked for feedback regarding readability and clarity of items. Some issues were raised. Smaller linguistic and semantic issues in translation were resolved by an independent bilingual translator. One major issue that emerged was unfamiliarity with some item content on the BCTI (e.g., Martin Luther King or Area 51 in the U.S.). In a further focus group with a number of graduate-level students, we attempted to clarify such items. To do so, we added brief information about the unfamiliar items in the BCTI in item stems (see Appendix 1). For the main study. Two research assistants approached potential participants and invited them to take part in a psychological research about \u201cvalues and beliefs.\u201d The order of presentation of all scales in the study was pre-randomized.

For the BCTI and CMQ, we used quartimax rotations because of the expectation of a single factor. For the GCBS, however, we used a varimax rotation because we expected an inter-correlated, multidimensional structure [44\u201345]. The number of factors to be extracted was determined by factor eigenvalues (\u03bb) above 1.0 (the EGV1 criterion), examination of the scree-plot, and where more than one factor was identified through rotation, the results of parallel analysis [46]. We specifically used O\u2019Connor\u2019s [47] syntax to conduct parallel analysis, which was used because scree-plot inspection and the EGV1 criterion are known to lead to factor over-retention [47\u201349]. Parallel analysis creates random datasets with the same number of cases and variables as the actual dataset. Factors in the actual data are only retained if their eigenvalues are greater than the mean of eigenvalues (with 95% CI) from the random data [46]. Factor loadings were interpreted using Tabachnick and Fidell\u2019s [50] recommendations and highly cross-loading items were discarded.",

In fact, Nunnaly [51] advocated a more conservative cut-off of .80, which was applied for newly adapted measures (i.e., BCTI, CMQ, and GCBS) in the present study. To assess convergent validity, we computed bivariate correlations between all study variables. According to Lipsey and Wilson [53, 54], correlations of .10 are considered small, correlations of .25 are considered medium, and correlations of .40 are considered large. We used independent-samples t-tests to examine between-group differences between women and men. Cohen\u2019s d [54] was computed as a measure of effect size. Effects are considered as large if differences are greater than 0.80, moderate if differences are between 0.50 and 0.80, and small if differences are between 0.20 and 0.50. Although we report p < .05 as our statistical significance level [55], we flag correlations where p < .005. Interpretations of convergent validity were based on the magnitude of the effects, rather than solely on statistical significance. In case of multiple comparisons, we applied Bonferroni correction to compensate for Type I error.",

More problematically, as we noted above, we encountered broader translational issues with the BCTI\u2013an issue that has previously been highlighted [19]; that is, given that the items of the BCTI were designed to reflect conspiracy theories that were known to Western audiences, they have limited practical use in populations that are not familiar with item content. To take one example, our pilot work indicated that some participants did not know the details about the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., let alone conspiracy theories surrounding the event. Likewise, although conspiracy theories of the 9/11 terrorist attacks are popular in Iran, the same cannot be said of conspiracy theories concerning the death of Princess Diana. One previous study reported similar issues in a study of French speaking-participants [56], where only 10 of the 15 BCTI items were selected as being recognizable to a French audience. In short, we suggest that the BCTI may show poor item functioning as a result of poor cross-cultural knowledge of content that was designed to be familiar to Western audiences.",

Indeed, item means on this measure were very high (see Table 2), which is could be interpreted as substantive participant agreement with items that reflect real-world phenomena. To the extent that items were interpreted as being factual, they may be inconsistent with definitions of a conspiracy theory, which require that such theories can be contradicted by the standards of mainstream knowledge.

Scores on the GCBS fared better in terms of convergent validity, as we found significant associations between some GCBS factors and education, schizotypal personality, information processing styles, culture-specific superstitious beliefs, and rightist political ideology. However, it should be noted that the pattern of correlations was not consistent across GCBS factors, and most significant correlations were weak at best. We also found that Iranian women scored higher on the BCTI, which is consistent with recent research indicating that Iranian women score higher on measures of superstition and magical thinking [36], yet this gender effect should be treated with caution until further replicated in future studies. A further issue of concern was the fact that, although scores on the three measures of conspiracist beliefs were significantly inter-correlated, the effect sizes of the associations were weak-to-moderate indicating poor evidence of convergent validity.

The first is that the three measures of conspiracist ideation are not adequately tapping the latent construct in the Iranian context, an issue we return to below. The second is that antecedents of conspiracist beliefs that have been reported in Western contexts may not be reliable correlates in Iran, possibly because of culture-specific issues. For example, Pipes [28] has suggested that the spread of conspiracy theories in the Middle East could be linked with the fortunes of political Islam, the contested nature of European thought, the plethora of actual conspiracies, and the specific nature of Middle Eastern politics, particularly pan-movements and autocracy. To this list, one might also add the political destabilization that has occurred in the region as a result of Western military intervention, as well as the role of the state in narrating and spreading conspiracy theories [29\u201330]. A further distinctive issue concerning conspiracy theories in the Middle East, including in Iran, is their widespread use by political and religious leaders as a means of mobilizing populist support [27,57]. In such a scenario, the conceptual meaning and function of conspiracist beliefs in Iran may be different to that in the West. As a result, correlates that were implicated in conspiracist beliefs in the West may not be reliable antecedents in Iran specifically or the Middle East more broadly.",

As mentioned, we aimed to include measures that fared psychometrically well and that have been widely-used in previous research. Yet, it is possible that these alternative measures may show better psychometric properties in non-Western societies. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to examine the factorial validity of the Persian translations of other existing measures of conspiracy ideation. Second, we did not examine the factorial validity of the measures using CFA. It is, therefore, recommended for future research to examine the latent structure of these measures by the means of comparing models developed in the parent studies and the models developed in the current exploratory analyses. Third, we did not assess the temporal stability of the three measures. As conspiracy beliefs are trait-like constructs that are not easily altered in short time intervals (see [59]), it is recommended for future research to examine test-retest reliability of these measures. Finally, future work could assess convergent validity through additional variables that may be more context-specific, such as variables that are derived from social identity theory [60].",

In particular, it would be useful to begin with qualitative research that seeks to more concretely understand the nature and function of conspiracy theories in Iran (or the Middle East), based on existing knowledge [27,28,30,61]. Such research could then form the basis for developing a new measure of generic conspiracist beliefs that is suitable for with Iranian participants. Alternatively, it should be possible to develop a measure of conspiracist beliefs that more accurately reflects conspiracy theories that are prevalent in Iran; that is, such a measure would be context- and culture-specific, with item content more usefully reflecting local knowledge and beliefs. Until such measures are available, scholars intending to assess conspiracist beliefs in Iran could use the 12-item BCTI or the 13-item GCBS, although we strongly advise scholars to assess factorial validity in their own samples. Use of the CMQ, on the other hand, should perhaps be limited, given known issues of construct validity and the ceiling effects reported in the present work.",
