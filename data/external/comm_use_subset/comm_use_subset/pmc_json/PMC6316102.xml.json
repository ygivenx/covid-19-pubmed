The capped PEDV genome of \u224828 kilobases consists of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frames (ORFs), and a 3\u2032 UTR that includes the poly(A) tail [3]. RNA elements in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) that are important for coronaviral gene expression are collectively referred to as cis-acting RNA elements [4]. For the coronavirus, the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) is a cis-acting RNA element required for subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis that is located downstream of the leader sequence and upstream of each ORF in the 3\u2032-proximal genome region [5]. An upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in the 5\u2032 UTR of coronaviruses has been shown to be important for virus fitness [6].",

RNA structures and their functions in coronaviral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis have also been identified in Betacoronavirus 3\u2032 UTRs, including the 5\u2032-most bulged stem-loop (BSL) [9,10], hair-pin pseudoknot (PK) [11], and 3\u2032-most hypervariable region (HVR) [12].

The TRS contains a conserved sequence (CS) flanked by variable sequences at its 5\u2032 (5\u2032 TRS) and 3\u2032 (3\u2032 TRS) ends [5,13]. During negative-strand sgmRNA synthesis, coronaviral polymerase along with negative-strand sgmRNA attenuates at the TRS-B, switches the template to the TRS-L, as guided by basepairing between the TRS-B and TRS-L, and then resumes to complete synthesis by copying the leader sequence [14,15]. In comparison with the 5\u2032 TRS, the 3\u2032 TRS has a more decisive influence on sgmRNA synthesis [16,17]. It has been proposed that a one-nucleotide (nt) (A) deletion immediately downstream of the CS-L may influence PEDV sgmRNA synthesis [3,18,19], though an in-depth examination to support this hypothesis has not been conducted.",

In 2013, the sudden appearance of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) with more severe diarrhea in the USA and a subsequent reoccurrence in Asian countries including Taiwan caused serious economic losses [3,23,24]. PED has since been one of the most devastating swine diseases worldwide. With such outbreaks, a crucial question is whether the pathogenicity of PEDV has been altered, leading to serious disease outbreaks. Because the coronavirus spike (S) protein interacts with a cellular receptor during virus entry [25,26] and functions by inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host [27,28,29], many studies have focused on a sequence comparison of the S protein between emergent or re-emergent PEDV strains and the prototype strain CV777 to seek a possible answer for PED outbreaks [18,24,30,31]. In addition to S protein, whether other factors play roles in the outbreak remain to be elucidated.",

The PEDV TW strain was maintained in Vero cells, as previously described [34,35]; the viral titer was 105 TCID50/mL. Vero cells in 35-mm dishes were infected with 200 \u00b5L of 105 TCID50/mL of PEDVPT-P5. The DNA constructs pTWDI, pCV777DI, p\u0394A S-TRS, and pS-TRS were linearized with MluI, transcribed in vitro to synthesize RNA transcripts with the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and passed through a Biospin 6 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After 2 h of infection with the helper virus, 3 \u00b5g of RNA transcript was transfected into the cells. To detect replication of PEDV DI RNA and DI RNA-derived sgmRNAs (sgm DI RNA), the supernatant was collected at 48 hour posttransfection (hpt) and then used to infect fresh Vero cells (virus passage 1, VP1). Ten micrograms of TRIzol-extracted total cellular RNA at 48 hpi of VP1 was used for the RT reaction with the reporter oligonucleotide TGEV(+) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

In these experiments, dilutions of plasmids containing the same gene as the detected DI RNA or sgm DI RNA were always run in parallel with the quantitated cDNA for use in standard curves (dilutions ranged from 108 to 10 copies of each plasmid). The amount of synthesized RNA was normalized to the levels of internal controls, including helper virus genomic RNA, 18S rRNA, and DI RNA.

Accordingly, the sequence representing the 300 nts of the 5\u2032 terminal region obtained for PEDV-positive samples (TW strain) were analyzed and compared with that of the PEDV prototype CV777. To understand whether the sequences for the 5\u2032 terminal genome region of other PEDV strains are also altered, the reference strains were also selected from GenBank based on the viruses that have been circulating in different countries in recent years (2012\u20132015) and compared. As shown in Figure 1, in comparison with CV777, a U-insertion at nt 48; an A deletion at nt 73, which was located immediately downstream of the TRS core sequence (CUAAAC); and a 4-nt deletion (UUCC) from nt 93 to 96 were identified. In addition, the bases at positions 8, 104, 122, and 292 were also altered to a G, C, A, and U, respectively. Of the PEDV reference strains selected from other countries, the 5\u2032-terminal sequence for the TW strain shared 100% nucleotide identity with that of the USA, Germany, and Korea reference strains. The change of the C and A at positions 104 and 122, respectively, also altered the amino acid encoded by the uORF (Figure 1B,C). Using the Mfold algorithm [36], four SLs were identified in the 5\u2032 terminal genome region of PEDV and the results were in agreement with those found by Madhugiria et al. in Alphacoronaviruses [4]. In comparison with CV777, the change at nt 8 for the TW strain slightly altered the structure of SL1 (Figure 1C), and the U-insertion at nt 48 slightly altered the loop but not the stem structure of SL2. The free energy (\u2206G) of SL1 and SL2 was found to increase from \u221211.1 and \u22121.8 kcal/mol for the CV777 strain to \u221212.5 and \u22123.9 kcal/mol for the TW strain, respectively. The 4-nt deletion plus 2 alterations in SL4 also slightly affected the overall structure of SL4, and a decrease in \u2206G from \u221227.4 for CV777 strain to \u221224.3 kcal/mol was calculated for TW strain. Although the U-alteration at nt 292 did not impair the structure of SL5, \u2206G decreased from \u221253.2 to \u221251.6 kcal/mol. The overall \u2206G of the four structures for CV777 and Taiwan strain was found to be \u221297.3 and \u221296.2 kcal/mol, respectively.",

After sequencing analysis, the \u22481700 bp RT-PCR product was identified to be N sgmRNA and the \u2248250 bp RT-PCR product, which consisted of a leader sequence and a part of the sequence from 3\u2032 UTR, was a previously unidentified sgmRNA species. The sgmRNA was derived from the CS-like sequence UUAAAC, which encompassed the stop codon of the N gene (Figure 3B, upper panel). The potential start codon AUG of the sgmRNA, which was located one nt downstream of the CS-like sequence, was also identified (Figure 3B, upper panel), and the ORF was predicted to encode a protein of 35 amino acids (Figure 3B, lower panel). In TGEV, sgmRNA 7 was also derived from a CS at a genome position similar to that in PEDV (Figure 3C), and the encoded protein of 78 amino acids has been demonstrated to be involved in the virulence [37]. Such a CS sequence at a position similar to that PEDV was also found in coronavirus 229E and Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 (Figure 3C), though the sgmRNAs derived from both putative CSs have not been experimentally identified. In comparison with CV777, three nts and three amino acids were altered within the ORF (Figure 3D,E, respectively). The region downstream of the gene encoding the N protein shows variations among Alphacoronaviruses, which may explain why the conserved counterpart of the Betacoronavirus BSL structure [9,10] could not be identified as a common structure in Alphacoronaviruses [4]. For PEDV, the BSL structure was identified using the Mfold algorithm [36], as shown in Figure 2B, yet it was located within the putative ORF, as described above (Figure 3D). The function of the protein encoded by the ORF of the sgmRNA and the importance of the predicted BSL structure to PEDV replication remain to be elucidated.",

To determine whether the observed variations in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs between TW and CV777 strains alter the efficiency of gene expression, a PEDV DI RNA for the TW strain was constructed; it was designated TW DI (Figure 4A). Because the CV777 strain was not available due to regulations in Taiwan, a CV777 DI RNA (designated CV777 DI, Figure 4B) was constructed via mutagenesis, which had TW DI as a backbone but with the CV777 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. For translation analysis, both DI RNAs were engineered to contain a reporter EGFP gene (Figure 4A) designated CV777 DI-EP and TW DI-EP. Vero cells were transfected with 3 \u00b5g of in vitro-transcribed RNA, and proteins in cell lysates were collected at 16 h posttransfection. The amount of synthesized EGFP was normalized to the levels of internal controls including \u03b2-actin and DI RNA. Note that both the DI RNAs cannot replicate because of the lack of helper virus in transfected cells and the stability of the two DI RNAs was similar at the time of RNA collection (data not shown). As shown in Figure 4C,D, the translation efficiency of TW DI-EP was \u22482.5-fold better than that of CV777 DI-EP, suggesting that the sequence alterations in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of TW DI-EP increased the translation efficiency in comparison with that of strain CV777. Note that, because uORF has been suggested to have an influence on translation, in addition to alterations in sequence and structure at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, the amino acid changes for uORF (Figure 1) may be a factor leading to the observed difference in translation efficiency.",

            "text": "Regarding the effect on replication, the replication efficiency for CV777 DI was extremely low when compared with that for TW DI (\u224820-fold difference) (Figure 4E) after 48 h of VP1. Sequencing analysis revealed that the leader sequence in CV777 DI was, in part, replaced by that of the helper virus TW strain, as a G at nt 8 and a U at nt 48 were identified. Except for the alterations in the leader sequence, no other changes in CV777 DI were found. It has been demonstrated that leader-switching occurred with a high frequency in the TRS region between DI RNA and the helper virus [43,44], and this may explain the replacement of the nts that occurred in the CV777 DI RNA leader sequence. Because it has been suggested that DI RNA is able to compete and recombine with the helper virus, such a nature may complicate the interpretation of the DI replication assay [45]. In the current study, it was found that the leader sequence of CV777 DI RNA was replaced by that of the helper virus, and consequently the recombination event may affect the quantitative results of the DI RNA replication assay. Whether the replication efficiency between wild-type CV777 and TW strain with full-length genome still shows a dramatic difference remains to be determined. Accordingly, at this point, we can only conclude that the variations in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs between CV777 and TW may influence replication efficiency using the DI RNA system. Further study using PEDV reverse genetic system is required to determine to what extent the variations in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs between the two strains affect replication efficiency.",

            "text": "TRSs are cis-acting elements required for coronavirus sgmRNA synthesis that are located at the 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence (TRS-L) and preceded by each gene (TRS-B). The TRS contains a CS flanked by variable sequences at its 5\u2032 (5\u2032 TRS) and 3\u2032 (3\u2032 TRS) ends of the CS. The CS of TRS-L (CS-L) in PEDV CV777 is CUAAAC. The CS of TRS-B (CS-B) for CV777 strain E, M, and N genes has been experimentally determined to be CUAGAC, AUAAAC, and CUAAAC, respectively [46] (Figure 5A, left panel for E, M, and N genes). Although the CS-B for the S and ORF3 genes for CV777 strain was previously assumed to be GUAAAC and CUAGAC, respectively [47] (Figure 5B,C, respectively, upper left panel), this has yet to be experimentally determined. In comparison with CV777, the CS-L of the TW strain was not altered, i.e., it was CUAAAC (Figure 1A). To determine the CS-B for TW, sgmRNA was amplified using RT-PCR followed by sequencing. The sequencing results were analyzed to identify the fusion sites in the genome with the 5\u2032 end of the virus, by which the CS-B for the S, ORF3, E, M, and N genes was determined (Figure 5A, right panel). The results suggested that the CS-B for E, M, and N was the same for PEDV TW and CV777; however, the CS-B for S and ORF3 for TW was different from the previously assumed CS-Bs for CV777. Instead of the previously assumed GUAAAC for CV777 (Figure 5B, upper left panel), the CS-B for the TW S gene was CGUAAA (Figure 5B, upper right panel), which was located one nt upstream of previously assumed GUAAAC. Based on the study by Sola et al. that found that TRS is defined as consisting of the central CS and the four nts immediately 5\u2032 (5\u2032 TRS) and 3\u2032 (3\u2032 TRS) of the CS, the overall identity of the S TRS-B with TRS-L for CV777 was slightly lower than that for TW (8 for CV777 and 10 for TW; Figure 5B, upper panel). We speculate the reason why GUAAAC was previously assumed to be the CS-B for the CV777 S gene may be attributed to its higher sequence identity with CS-L in comparison with CGUAAA for TW (5 for CV777 and 3 for TW; Figure 5B, upper panel). However, the higher identity between the 5\u2032 TRS-B and 5\u2032 TRS-L (1 for CV777 and 4 for TW) and between the 3\u2032 TRS-B and 3\u2032 TRS-L (2 for CV777 and 3 for TW) may be a more decisive factor for the outcome based on CGUAAA being selected for TW. With regard to ORF3, CS-B CCUUAC for TW (Figure 5C, upper right panel), which was located 11 nts downstream of the previously assumed CUAGAC for CV777 (Figure 5C, upper left panel), was identified. The same reason as described above for the S gene CS-B may be involved, whereby the previously assumed CUAGAC of ORF3 for CV777 showed higher identity with the CS-L in comparison with that for TW while lower identity between the 5\u2032 TRS-B and 5\u2032 TRS-L (0 for CV777 and 4 for TW) and between the 3\u2032 TRS-B and 3\u2032 TRS-L (1 for CV777 and 3 for TW) is observed. Based on the argument above, it is currently assumed that the CS of TRS-B (CS-B) for CV777 strain S and ORF3 genes is CGUAAA (Figure 5A, left panel and Figure 5B, lower left panel) and CCUUAC (Figure 5A, left panel and Figure 5C, lower left panel), respectively; however, the exact CS-B of S and ORF3 genes for CV777 remains to be experimentally determined with RNA collected from CV777-infected cells.",

            "text": "According to the current study shown in Figure 1 and previous reports [3,18,19], in comparison with CV777, an A deletion at nt 73 immediately downstream of CS-L was frequently identified for PEDV, including the TW strain. It has been proposed that such a deletion immediately downstream of CS-L may have influence on PEDV sgmRNA synthesis [3,18,19], though further examination to support this hypothesis has been not performed. As the TRS is defined to consist of the central CS and the four nts immediately flanking the 5\u2032 (5\u2032 TRS) and 3\u2032 (3\u2032 TRS) CS [17] and based on the alignment shown in Figure 5A, the one-nt deletion immediately downstream of the CS-L in the TW strain (Figure 5A, right panel) results in increased identity for the 3\u2032 TRS between TRS-B and TRS-L for S, ORF3, E, and M, but not N genes, in comparison with CV777 (Figure 5A, left panel). This was also true for comparison of the previously (Figure 4B,C, upper left panel) and currently (Figure 4B,C, lower left panel) assumed CS-B of S and ORF3 gene for CV777. Because the 3\u2032 TRS has a more decisive influence on template-switching during sgmRNA synthesis [16,17], the increased identity of the 3\u2032 TRS in these genes may enhance sgmRNA synthesis. Furthermore, it has been suggested that if the identity of the 5\u2032 TRS and 3\u2032 TRS of CS-B with those of CS-L reaches a plateau in G value, template-switching is able to occur for sgmRNA synthesis, even though CS-B exhibits low identity with CS-L [17]. Thus, in comparison with the TW strain, the decreased identity in the CV777 3\u2032 TRS may have an influence on the synthesis of S, ORF3, and M sgmRNAs because their CS-Bs also have low identity with CS-L. Accordingly, in comparison with CV777, the increased sequence identity of the 3\u2032 TRS between TRS-L and TRS-B of S, ORF3, E, and M (but not N) genes in TW may alter the relative efficiency of sgmRNA synthesis.",

In addition, \u0394A S-TRS (Figure 6A, left panel) was also constructed, in which the 3\u2032 TRS of the TRS-B for the S gene was mutated to decrease its sequence identity with the 3\u2032 TRS of the TRS-L (Figure 6B). As shown in Figure 6C, the efficiency of subgenomic DI RNA synthesized from \u0394A S-TRS was decreased in comparison with that from S-TRS. The results suggest that the increase in sequence identity between the leader TRS and body TRS leads to enhanced subgenomic mRNA synthesis, which is in agreement with our hypothesis. Indeed, these results were not unexpected based on previously published studies regarding the correlation of TRS sequence identity with sgmRNA synthesis [16,17,48,49,50]. However, it is the first study on the content of a PEDV genome demonstrating that the increased sequence identity between the leader TRS and body TRS enhances sgmRNA synthesis. The results also support the previously proposed hypothesis [3,18,19] that the increased 3\u2032 TRS sequence identity between TRS-L and TRS-B in the TW strain caused by a deletion immediately downstream of CS-L has influence on PEDV sgmRNA synthesis. In conclusion, the results support our hypothesis that increased 3\u2032 TRS sequence identity between TRS-L and TRS-B in the TW strain caused by a deletion immediately downstream of CS-L has an influence on PEDV sgmRNA synthesis.",

Functional analyses suggest that such variations in cis-acting elements for the TW strain compared with the CV777 strain have an influence on the efficiency of gene expression. Therefore, it is speculated that variations in cis-acting elements may also be one of the factors potentially contributing to the pathogenesis. Although the cis-acting elements of the Thailand reference strain are the same as those of the CV777 strain, we still cannot exclude the importance of the cis-acting elements because it is not clear whether the Thailand reference strain is virulent or not based on the insufficient information from GenBank. Accordingly, we also cannot rule out other factors that also play roles in the PED outbreak. Further study is required to determine to what extent the variations in cis-acting elements affect the virulence and pathogenesis using a reverse genetic system.",
