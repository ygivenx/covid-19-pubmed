Several methods to immobilize antibodies on the sensor chip surface have been developed, including physical adsorption, covalent binding, and specific interaction between avidin and biotin [9,10]. However, these previous methods have limitations in terms of denaturization, extra chemical modification and random orientation. In order to overcome these issues, Brown et al. and Park et al. developed specific gold-binding polypeptide (GBP) that endows the orientation of proteins in their functional state [11,12]. GBP shows a strong binding affinity to the gold surface without any surface modifications [13\u201315].

The detection of a specific antibody among serological assays in blood samples was performed in the microfluidic biosensor chip by immunoreactions between the GBP-recombinant influenza hemagglutinin antigen (GBP-H1a) fusion protein and its specific antibody (Ab).

After docking and priming of the SPR chip, PBS was used to flush the activated surface and thereby minimize non-specific binding and any unbound sites by removing loosely bound material and dust. All samples were injected onto the gold chip surface at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min for 10 min at room temperature using a liquid-handling micropipette in the SPR system.

The microchannels-embedded master mold was obtained by a milling technique, and it was used for casing the microfluidic devices. In this case, COC was chosen as a substrate material to produce the device due to its great advantages over the other thermoplastic polymers in terms of optical, physical and chemical properties and biocompatibility. The total cycle time of the microinjection molding process took less than 1 min to replicate the COC substrate. After location of the master mold in the injection mold machine, COC was injected through the nozzle, and the microfluidic device was released from the mold. The production process and conditions are similar to the previous research which demonstrated various microinjection conditions to form microstructures [17]. Holes of 1 mm in diameter for an inlet and outlet ports were punched to load the sample and buffer solutions into the microchannels. As shown in Figure 1, the channel depths are 200 and 500 \u03bcm with 450 \u03bcm in width, respectively. The diameter of the detection chamber is 1 mm, and it was coated with chromium and gold by sputtering for the immobilization of GBP-H1a fusion protein. The design and fabrication process of microfluidic device are described in Figure 1(A). The key features of microstructures including welding lines, gold deposition on detection chamber, and backflow prevention structures are schematically demonstrated in Figure 1B. Previously, thermal bonding method has been popular to bond plastic-based microfluidic device. However, this method requires high temperature and takes too much time to bond it. Recently, an ultrasonic bonding method has been developed as an alternative solution to the thermal bonding. However, welding line is essential for bonding between plastic chips in this technique. In this experiment, we carefully designed the welding lines as shown in red color in Figure 1(B), and these lines were melted during the ultrasonic bonding process for the sealing of the chips. After coating of gold, two COC plates were placed on the ultrasonic bonder (2,000X, Branson) and set the bonder in time mode with weld frequency of 20 kHz. After the setting of the mode, the COC was bonded as following conditions: (1) 800 Pa weld pressure, (2) 0.2 s of weld time, (3) 75% of amplitude, (4) 10 s of hold time, (5) 1.5 kPa of hold pressure. Occasionally, backflow of the buffer or target solutions occurs in microfluidic channels during the injection to cause a contamination problem. Therefore, there would be required a unique microstructure in a microchannel to prevent backflow of solution and contamination of microchannel. Among various methods, two different channel depths were applied into this device as shown in Figure 1(B). This method was worked properly due to the pressure difference in the microchannel to prevent the backflow.",

In addition, usage of plastic facilitates low-cost mass production of disposable and easy-to-use microfluidic chips. Previously reported plastic-based immunosensors required a surface modification step for the immobilization of biomolecules. Among these methods, silanization using 3-aminopropyltriethyoxysilane (APTES) is a widely used method for coupling of biomolecules onto the inorganic substrate [18]. However, silane is difficult to react with organic materials without any hydroxyl groups present on the surface by using UV/ozone treatment [5]. In order to overcome these issues, a specially engineered peptide was developed and used to immobilize onto the specific targeted surface, especially gold. There is no requirement of complicated steps for coupling of antibody or antigen. The GBP-H1a fusion protein can be simply and selectively immobilized in the microchannel on the gold surface as described in Figure 1(C).",

Due to the height differences between inlet channels and main channels (Figure 2(C,D)), this could prevent the backflow of the solutions. This device is composed of three detection chambers with 1 mm in diameter for the further immobilization of GBP-H1a fusion protein as shown in Figure 2, and these chambers may reduce the errors during analysis by averaging signals. All protuberant microstructures near to the microchannels were specially designed as welding lines.

A greater shift in resonance unit (RU) was observed by SPR analysis with increasing concentration of immobilized GBP-H1a fusion protein bound on the planar surface at various concentrations as shown in Figure 3(A). These results suggest that the SPR sensor with GBP-fusion protein implemented on the gold surface can be an effective system for biomolecular immobilization.

Cy3-labeled anti-H1 Ab is a strongly fluorescent molecule, and the fluorescence-based immunoassay is more sensitive compared to the most colorimetric assays in most of the cases [5]. The whole immunosensing process was carried out by using COC microfluidic chips at room temperature. The three detection chambers are included in one microchannel to verify the sensing results which may reduce the error of the signal. In addition, one chip is composed of three different detection zones to test different concentrations of the target Abs. First of all, 100 \u03bcg/mL of GBP-H1a fusion protein was injected through the microchannel for the immobilization on the surface of gold surface. After immobilization for 1 h, all the chips were washed with PBS solution and BSA solution (1 mg/mL) was injected to the channels to prevent the non-specific binding then washed with PBS solution. After the blocking and washing process, five different concentrations of Cy3-labeled-Ab (100, 50, 10, 5, and 1 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) were injected through the microchannel and left them for 1 h. After incubation for the further reaction, all immunosensors were rinsed with PBS solution three times, and the microchannels were blown off by air. All microfluidic immunosensor chips were examined under same conditions of confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM510 Meta NLO, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) as shown in Figure 4. At the low concentration of Cy3-labeled Ab applied, small fluorescent signals were observed in the detection chambers. As increasing the concentration of Ab, the whole detection chamber was covered with red fluorescence, and the signal intensities were also increased. In order to compare the signal intensity, the intensity profiles were also recorded because the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the amount of Cy3-labeled Ab attached to the surface of detection chamber. The fluorescence intensity changes at the center of chamber were measured, and their fluorescent images with same scale in Y-axis were showed. The fluorescent intensity graphs which correspond to each inserted white line also showed similar signal changing patterns compared with the fluorescent image. From these results, the specific binding of GBP-H1a was successfully immobilized on the gold surface, and the fluorescent images and emission profiles were subsequently increased due to the effective binding of Cy3-labeled anti-H1 Ab, which could be applicable in immunoassay onto the microfluidic chip surface.",
