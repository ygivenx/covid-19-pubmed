            "text": "In recent decades, the understanding of the mechanism and regulation of translation made major progress. The translation process consists of three steps\u2014initiation, elongation, and termination. The initiation phase can be carried out in two ways in eukaryotic cells\u2014cap-dependent or cap-independent [1]. Some viruses accomplish translation initiation via cap-dependent mechanisms with varying utilization of host eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) [2]. In the cap-dependent mechanism, to translate a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, it is important that the mRNA be recruited in the eIF4F complex, which is composed of three proteins\u2014the eIF4E protein, which binds to the cap, helicase eIF4A, and eIF4G [3,4]. The eIF4E protein can control eIF4F complex formation and interfere with cellular translation via phosphorylation on serine 209 [1,5]. The regulation of the elongation cycle is best studied in the eukaryotic system. All known viruses rely on cellular elongation factors for expression of the viral genome.",

            "text": "Viruses lack their own translational apparatus and are dependent entirely on the cellular translation machinery for their genome replication, new particle assembly, and release of new viral progeny. Especially for RNA viruses, translation of the viral genome is a critical control point in the replication cycle; several drugs were developed to take advantage of this vulnerability. As it is known, ribavirin of a guanosine analog inhibits replication of RNA and DNA viruses via distinctive mechanisms [6]. It represses the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) via distinct mechanisms in different cell types, depending on intracellular ribavirin metabolism [7]. Among other mechanism of actions, ribavirin blocks eIF4E activity, and thus, reduces eIF4E-dependent survival signaling [8,9]. Silvestrol has multiple mechanisms of action, including an effect on certain microRNA, proteins important to protect the cell from damage, and proteins involved in the cell cycle [10]. It also acts as a specific inhibitor of eIF4A [11], which is a potent inhibitor of Ebola virus replication [12]. Viruses utilize host cell machinery of translation to facilitate their own replication. Inhibitors of translation elongation, an obligate step in the viral replication cycle, may also provide a general antiviral strategy. Properly used, cycloheximide (CHX) can block viral replication; unfortunately, its cytotoxic side effects and poor tolerability were prohibitive for its development as a drug [13,14]. Lactimidomycin (LTM) prevents the ribosome from leaving the start site and blocks the very first round of translation elongation. This recently established anticancer agent [15] potently inhibits infections of dengue virus and other RNA viruses in cell culture [16].",

HHT was used in China for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and other types of tumor diseases for the past 30 years [19]. Omacetaxine, a semisynthetic form of HHT, was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CML treatment in 2012. Pro-survival protein Mcl-1 and pro-oncoprotein c-Myc are critical regulators that promote the survival of leukemia cells; HHT could affect the survival of leukemia cells by allowing the rapid loss of short-lived Mcl-1 and c-Myc to facilitate proapoptotic triggering [19,20,21,22,23]. Leukemia cells express a high level of phosphorylated eIF4E; inhibiting phosphorylation of eIF4E represents a unique approach for the treatment of cancer development and progression [24,25]. It was recently reported that HHT targets the phosphorylated serine 209 residue of eIF4E, resulting in the degradation of phosphorylated eIF4E, thereby eradicating the growth of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo [26,27].",

No measurable decrease in cell viability was detected at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M [37,38]. Therefore, HHT at concentrations below 1 \u00b5M was administered in the experiments described here. For testing potential dose-dependent antiviral activity, HEK293T cells were infected with VSV in the presence of HHT or ribavirin at increasing concentrations. We observed that viral yields were reduced by 1.5 orders of magnitude when treated with HHT at 50 nM, and viral yields were dramatically reduced in cells treated with HHT at 100 nM; no measurable decrease in cell viability was detected.

We observed a strong reduction in viral protein G levels of VSV (VSV-G) at 24 and 36 h post infection (h.p.i.) under treatment with HHT at 50 nM (Figure 1C). Time-of-addition studies were conducted to identify the window in the VSV replication cycle when HHT exerted its antiviral effect. The results showed that pre-treatment of cells with HHT for 2 h prior to VSV infection produced a minimal inhibitory effect against viral infection. This suggests that HHT does not inhibit the VSV entry process (Figure 1D). A complete reduction of the viral yields was observed when HHT was added at the time of infection and from 2 h.p.i. onward. Addition of HHT at 6 and 8 h.p.i. led to strong viral reductions of 6.5 and 5 orders of magnitude. Under the same experimental conditions, strong reductions in VSV-G levels were observed with co-treatment and post-treatment for up to 8 h for VSV infection (Figure 1E). These results indicate that HHT acts in the viral replication cycle after viral entry.",

GFP-NDV and different doses of HHT were injected into the allantoic cavity of SPF chicken embryos. Viral yields from allantoic fluids of embryos were measured by HA assay. As shown as in Figure 2D, HHT at a dose of 0.07 mg/kg had a slight effect on viral infection; 0.1 mg/kg HHT reduced HAU values by one and three orders of magnitude at 36 and 48 h.p.i., respectively. Remarkably, 0.2 mg/kg HHT provided the optimal inhibitory activity, and completely inhibited viral infection. Finally, we studied whether HHT displays potent antiviral activity against NDV in chickens. As shown in Figure 2E,F, 0.2 mg/kg HHT significantly decreased the mRNA level of NDV-NP in the liver and lung (Figure 2E), and blood (Figure 2F). HHT-treated animals did not exhibit a pathological change in tissues or symptoms such as diarrhea and drooping.",

HHT at 400 nM was added at different times before and after infection of cells with PEDV. Similar to the result shown in Figure 1D, a less than 30% infection rate was found when HHT was added at 0, 2, and 6 h.p.i.

No obvious reduction in the number of AIV positive cells was observed in mice treated with HHT at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (e,i). Moreover, HHT treatment for two days decreased local inflammatory reaction but aggravated overall inflammation (f), while HHT treatment for four days resulted in moderately attenuated inflammation (j). No obvious inflammatory reaction was seen in mice treated with HHT at days 0, 2, and 4 after administration (k,l,m). These results indicated that HHT did not efficiently affect AIV-induced inflammation and damage. We also studied the effect of HHT on AIV in embryos. As shown in Figure 4B, 0.1 mg/kg HHT reduced the HAU value by 1.1 and 1.3 orders of magnitude at 48 and 72 h.p.i.; and 0.2 mg/kg HHT reduced the HAU value by 2.6 and 2.0 orders of magnitude at 48 and 72 h.p.i., respectively.

Furthermore, high levels of p-eIF4E, in parallel with the level of viral protein, were gradually reduced under treatment with increasing doses of HHT (lanes 3\u20137).

To further clarify whether HHT regulating p-eIF4E level is associated with viral replication, two constructs encoding the wild-type FLAG-tagged eIF4E and the phosphorylation-incompetent variant eIF4E-S209A were transiently transfected, followed by HSV-1 infection. As shown in Figure 6E, the ectopic expression of wild-type eIF4E (lane 3), but not eIF4E-S209A (lane 4), greatly improved the level of p-eIF4E, and also upregulated the expression of viral ICP8 (lane 3). Furthermore, we detected that HHT treatment decreased the accumulation of p-eIF4E induced by the ectopic expression of wild-type eIF4E, coincident with decreased viral propagation (lane 5). Taken together, the results shown in Figure 6B\u2013E indicate that HHT attenuates the phosphorylation level of endogenous and exogenous eIF4E to counteract HSV-1 replication.",

Due to the intrinsically high mutation rate of RNA viruses, resistance to antiviral drugs that act against viral targets can occur rapidly [47]. Focus on antivirals that target host factors is, thus, expected to be an advantageous strategy, because escape mutations are rarer [48,49]. Cellular translation is necessary for viral replication, and inhibition of protein production may impair or delay the proliferation of viral pathogens; however, the inhibition of host factors is often a problematic issue in drug development, due to pleiotropic unwanted side effects [50,51].",

Total eIF4E activity is required for proliferation of both tumor and normal cells, whereas phosphorylated eIF4E is not essential for normal cell proliferation and survival, but is specifically required for cancer cells [54,55,56]. Stimulation of eIF4E phosphorylation is correlated with facilitated translation and replication of some viruses [57,58,59], including murine coronavirus [60] and herpesvirus HSV-1 [61]. In contrast, dephosphorylation of eIF4E occurs during infection with influenza virus [62], VSV, or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [63]. Sometimes, phosphorylation is not required for eIF4E to support the viral replication of hepatitis E virus [64]. Notably, fibroblasts and mice in which the serine at position 209 of eIF4E is replaced with alanine (low level of p-eIF4E) are less susceptible to virus infections, including HSV-1, VSV, and EMCV [65]. Therefore, the phosphorylation status of eIF4E acts as a determinant of host susceptibility to a virus.",
