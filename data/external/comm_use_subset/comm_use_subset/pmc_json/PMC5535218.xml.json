Research into the use of engineered bulk size materials (i.e., stainless steels) [11,12,13], micro- [14,15], and nano- [1,16] sized materials (i.e., metal and metal oxides) against a spectrum of bacteria and viruses have been a popular field, especially since the SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003. The continuation of growing numbers of infectious diseases in hospitals, [17] propagation of pathogens, and their resistance against conventional antibiotics [18] have significantly raised global concern. Therefore using nanomaterials as antibacterials complementary to antibiotics is highly promising and is gaining a large interest, as they may fill the gaps where antibiotics frequently fail [19]. ",

The findings assisted in the development of novel and innovative antimicrobial agents in an era of ever-increasing antimicrobial resistance. The potential of using nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents raised concerns about the possibility of nanoparticle toxicity on the central nervous system (CNS) [21,22,23]. In vivo investigation using hippocampus cells in young rats suggested an interactive connection between nano ZnO/Ag/CuO and the effectiveness of learning ability and the flexibility of cognition [21,24,25,26]. Nevertheless, incremental nano-dosages increased the excitability in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons and confirmed a safety threshold of 0.05 wt % of injection suspension, which has provided an insight regarding the relative toxicity concern over the use of nanoparticles in biomedical engineering [27,28,29]. These findings proved the novelty of antimicrobial nanoparticles (AMNP) in a cost-effective fashion for inhibiting microbial growth, which may bring major changes in policy and new regulations on the wider uses of nanoparticles in biomedical healthcare [7,16,30].

Through the chemical investigation, we found that C, W, Ag, Cu, and O are the main elements contained in these AMNP formulations, and we also identified several phases present in these series (i.e., WC, WC1\u2212x, CuO). By understanding the lattice structures and chemistry of these antimicrobial nanoparticle composites, we hope to identify biological surface-interactions between these ultra-small particles and the microbes. This will help in studying the reaction mechanisms involved in target bacterium or viruses, and will also help to design and create custom-made antimicrobial formulations in the future.",

In this regard, Raman active vibrational bands at ca. 265, 715, and 803 cm\u22121 observed in the AMNP0 spectrum (Figure 2b) coincide with those for the commercial WC sample [38] (Figure 2a), associated to stretching vibrational motions of the WC triple bond. In turn, the Raman spectra for AMNP1 and AMNP2 (Figure 3a,b) were observed to exhibit significant differences with respect to those of the commercial WC and AMNP0. In summary, clearly defined vibrational bands centred at ca. 1335/1298 and 1582/1597 cm\u22121 were observed for AMNP1/AMNP2, respectively, with the Raman active peaks at lower frequency associated with the so-called D-band characteristic of the A1g mode of diamond type carbon with sp3 hybridisation. Thus, the vibrational bands at higher frequency were observed to be in agreement with the G vibrational band (E2g) characteristic of sp2 hybridised graphitic carbon [38,39]. The relative intensity of the D and G vibrational bands indicates a greater degree of graphitisation in AMNP2 [40]. In addition, Raman active vibrational bands at ca. 807, 716, and 272 cm\u22121 in the spectrum of AMNP1 (Figure 3a) are consistent with the presence of WC (vide supra). In fact, these active Raman bands may also be present in AMNP2 (Figure 3b), only it was swarmed by overlapping with other active signals due to the high complexity of the samples. ",

We were unable to obtain a 13C signal from the commercial WC, however, this may be due to the paramagnetic effect caused by the presence of impurities in the commercial sample which was detected later from the XRD analysis. At present, there is insufficient NMR reports relating to metal carbides, whereas here we report the first 13C-NMR resonance observed in a WC sample. The lack of NMR study in metal carbides is due to the lack of aliphatic carbon (CH) present in carbide ions and also the attribution of the sp hybridised carbon, which are known to largely reduce the sensitivity of detection. With the chosen parameters (10 s relaxation delay) applied to these NMR experiments, we were able to observed three active carbon chemical signals resonating at \u03b4C 123, 254, and 307 ppm (top spectrum in Figure 4) in the AMNP0 sample. The one that resonated at \u03b4C 123 ppm is typically associated with aromatic/graphitic/charcoal type of carbon. Whereas the other two deshielded resonances at \u03b4C 254 and 307 ppm indicated carbon environments that are less electronegative, which match the chemical property of a carbide type carbon [41]. In contrast, the signal observed at \u03b4C 254 ppm was indeed comparable to the NMR shifts observed in Scandium carbide Sc2C2 (\u03b4C 253 ppm) and Yttrium carbide Y2C2 (\u03b4C 257 ppm) reported by Yamazaki et al. [41] and Zhang et al. [42]. An exceedingly rare 13C-NMR resonance published by Buss et al. [43] observed a carbon resonance exhibited at \u03b4C 546 ppm from a novel molybdenum carbide complex, thus the unusually sharp signal observed at \u03b4C 307 ppm could also be interpreted as a metal carbide resonance.

As expected, AMNP0 gave only singlets at 283.4 eV in the C1s spectrum, which is ascribed with the metal carbide energy state [39].

It is worth noting that the initial asymmetric peak at 284 eV with a tailed binding energy of 288 eV was found in both C1s spectra (Figure 9a and Figure 10a) in AMNP1 and AMNP2. These are associated with the common adventitious carbon contaminant (according to Thermo Scientific instruments application note). These peaks were subsequently removed by applying Argon clusters and were not observed at the 30 s etch time and onwards. Multiple binding energies (satellite features) were measured between 183 and 285 eV in the C1s spectra (Figure 9a and Figure 10a) indicating that both AMNP1 and AMNP2 have a high concentration of sp2 carbons [54,55]. This feature is also supported by the broad and asymmetric tail towards high eV, hence, if the sample contains a high sp3 concentration, the C1s peak will appear to be more symmetrical. Again the high content of graphitic carbon present in both AMNP1 and AMNP2 samples measured in the XPS analyses agrees with the results obtained from the corresponding Raman and NMR data reported earlier in Section 3.2.",

Metal Tungsten (W) has a reference XPS binding energy of 31.6/33.5 (doublet) and this W4f7/2/W4f5/2 feature in lost as the transition state of W changes to other W compounds (i.e., W2C/WC), hence eV shifts to higher energy are observed in the cases of both AMNP1 (Figure 9b) and AMNP2 (Figure 10b) [53]. Again, two sets of doublets in the W4f spectrum for AMNP2 (Figure 10b) were measured at 32/33.2 eV and 32/34.2 eV, which suggest different phases of the W compounds (i.e., W and WC) are present in AMNP2.

Cu2p content was later quantified as 0.5% (Table 2) relative to the entire AMNP1 sample. Similar to the W4f core, significant split spin-orbit doublets (\u2206 = 19.75 eV) [53] were found in both XPS Cu2p spectra for AMNP1 (Figure 9c) and AMNP2 (Figure 10c). In contrast, the Cu content (CuO as identified from the XRD analysis) measured at 932.8/952.6 eV in AMNP2 is substantially higher than those found in AMNP1. ",

All of the Ag3d regions for both AMNP1 (368/374 eV) and AMNP2 (368/374 eV) samples, as expected, appeared as asymmetric doublets and have well separated spin-orbit components (\u2206 = 6.0 eV). Small shifts observed in these binding energies, particularly in AMNP1, may have been associated with the presence of oxides. Finally, the atomic ratio variation between C, O, W, Ag, and Cu were investigated. The atomic ratio of samples AMNP0, AMNP1, and AMNP2 were also measured during the XPS analyses at etch intervals of 0, 30, 60, 120, 200, and 240 s, and Figure 8c shows an illustrated sample of an atomic ratio diagram for the AMNP0. In summary, the overall atomic ratios were found and the average values were calculated using the data obtained from 30, 60, 120, 200, and 240 s intervals, as the sample surfaces at these intervals were stabilised under the conditions applied. The average atomic ratios for all three samples are given in Table 2.",
