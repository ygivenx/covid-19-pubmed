A number of potential enteropathogens have been found in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic feline faeces, including bacterial, viral, protozoal and other parasitic organisms\n[2-6]. However, reports of co-infection with 2 or more enteropathogens are surprisingly limited, and have predominantly involved Giardia spp. and Tritrichomonas foetus[7-11]. Reports of 3 or more pathogens occurring simultaneously in feline faeces are scarce. However, a recent small study examined the faeces of 50 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic cats entering a Florida animal shelter using a real-time PCR assay for a panel of 8 enteropathogens. Multiple organisms were identified in 44% of diarrhoeic cats in that study, but specific patterns of co-infection were not evaluated\n[12].",

While these techniques are often still the most appropriate to diagnose the cause of diarrhoea in cats, they can be time consuming, costly and may require significant sample volumes, making testing for multiple enteropathogens impractical. The development of real-time PCR has enabled rapid screening of small quantities of faeces for potential enteropathogens. More recently, PCR assays capable of detecting multiple potential enteropathogens in a single faecal sample have become available for a variety of species including domestic pets\n[15-17]. The results generated by these assays offer for the first time the opportunity to examine co-infection patterns for selected enteropathogen species, and may form the basis for further, targeted enteropathogen testing and subsequent treatment decisions.",

Co-infection was investigated via two approaches \u2013 consideration of which enteropathogens were co-occurring in samples, and the exact combination of enteropathogens present. In addition, considering that previous reports have documented a higher prevalence of enteropathogens in juvenile cats\n[2,7-9,18-21] and pedigree cats\n[7,8,18], secondary objectives were to evaluate individual enteropathogen prevalence and frequency of co-infection in association with pedigree status and age.",

In addition, while co-infection by enteropathogens was common (62.5%), 12.7% of cats were negative for all 8 enteropathogens \u2013 which was greater than expected by chance alone. Mean (\nx\u00af) enteropathogen co-infection (2.01) was higher in pedigree cats (\nx\u00af =2.51, DSH\nx\u00af =1.68) and decreased with age (\nx\u00af =2.64 <6 months,\nx\u00af =1.68 for >1 yr). T. foetus was more likely to occur together with feline coronavirus, C. perfringens and Giardia spp..

Univariate general linear models with binomial errors were used to assess for differences in the prevalence of the 8 enteropathogen with pedigree status (DSH or pedigree) and age group (<6 months, 6\u201312 months and >12 months) and differences within factors were examined using standard post-hoc Tukey pairwise comparisons (phTpc), which adjusted for the multiple pairwise testing within a factor. A multivariable model was then run to look at the interaction between age group and pedigree status, and whether taking one factor into account resulted in a change in statistical significance associated with the other factor. Analyses of the number of enteropathogenic species detected in samples were examined in a similar way but general linear models with Poisson errors were used instead.",

Here the number of observed samples with particular species was compared to what would have been expected if the species being considered were randomly distributed in samples at the frequency observed for each species on its own. Combinations of pairs, triplets etc. all the way up to all 8 species were considered. For each comparison whether other species not being considered were present or not were ignored.

For example the fingerprint \u2018F:CoTr\u2019 indicates that a faecal sample was positive for Co and Tr, and negative for all other species tested (Pa, Cl, Sa, Gi, Cr and To). These fingerprints were first examined with hierarchical cluster analyses using Ward\u2019s minimum variance method to produce a cluster dendrogram. The significance of each particular profile was then examined by comparing the number of observed samples with that particular profile to what would have been expected to have occurred if the 8 species were randomly distributed in samples at the frequency observed for each species on its own (i.e. each species presence or absence was included in the estimation of what would be expected).",

A co-occurrence analysis was used to look at co-infection with 2\u20138 species, irrespective of the presence or absence of the other enteropathogens. This permitted evaluation of which of the 8 enteropathogenic species were likely to occur in diarrhoeic cat samples submitted by first opinion veterinarians as determined by this type of diagnostic assay. However, the co-occurrence approach did not evaluate enteropathogen absence as a determinant of precise co-infection patterns. Co-infection patterns were therefore also evaluated using fingerprint analysis, which took into account the absence or presence of each of the 8 enteropathogens studied. This permitted consideration of the interaction between specific enteropathogens. This study demonstrated that multiple co-infections were common, with at least 2 of the 8 enteropathogens detected in 62.5% cats. Moreover, the results indicated that co-infection was often not a random event, in terms of which of the 8 enteropathogens were observed to occur together. Another interesting result was that 12.7% of cats with reported diarrhoea had none of the 8 enteropathogen species tested by this assay, which was significantly higher than would be expected based on chance alone.",

Feline panleukopenia virus was detected in 22.1% of samples, which is comparable to a detection rate of 19.2% in 52 faecal samples from cats with diarrhoea by electron microscopy in a previous study\n[24], but higher than the anecdotal incidence of clinical feline panleukopenia infection in the UK. Possible explanations include asymptomatic infection, passive viral carriage, or false positive results occurring as a result of modified live vaccine administration within the preceding 2 weeks\n[25]. Alternatively, PCR cross reactivity with canine parvovirus (CPV) could be responsible, given that CPV was detected by PCR in 37% of faecal samples from asymptomatic shelter cats in a recent study\n[26]. The prevalence of C. perfringens alpha toxin gene was 56.6%, consistent with previous data\n[5,6]. Giardia spp. were detected in 20.6% samples, corresponding to previous prevalence estimates ranging from 0.58-80% depending on the test population and detection method employed\n[19,20,27-29].

Using an 8-way PCR assay, co-infection with \u2265 2 enteropathogenic species was observed in 62.5% faecal samples, and overall mean species carriage was 2.01 (Figure \n2a). A higher mean enteropathogen carriage was identified in both pedigree (Figure \n2b) and young cats (Figure \n2c), consistent with the higher prevalence of both Giardia spp. and T. foetus observed in these groups and also the higher prevalence of feline coronavirus, feline panleukopenia virus and Cryptosporidium spp. in the youngest cats in this study and in previous reports\n[2,7-9,18,20]. Consistent with these observations, 69% of cats with no enteropathogens detected were found to be DSH cats > 12 months of age. The increased enteropathogen carriage in pedigree and young cats could reflect genetic or age related reductions in immune-competence, or increased contact with other cats in cattery, breeding, and cat-show establishments. Increased housing density has been identified as a risk factor for T. foetus[27], feline coronavirus\n[31-33] and Giardia spp. infections in cats\n[34], possibly reflecting the common faeco-oral route of infection. Alternatively, housing conditions may influence disease risk in cats as a result of stress\n[35]. In the case of gastrointestinal disease, the mechanism responsible is thought to involve alterations in epithelial barrier function\n[36].",

Several studies have described co-infection with T. foetus and Giardia spp., with co-infection prevalence rates ranging from 4.3% to 54%\n[7,8,27]. In a study of experimentally-induced T. foetus infection in cats, the duration and severity of diarrhoea was significantly greater in cats with chronic pre-existing and asymptomatic C. parvum infection than in specific pathogen free cats. In addition, co-infected cats were more likely to suffer episodes of acute self-limiting diarrhoea in the chronic phase (> 7 weeks) of T. foetus infection, particularly following diagnostic procedures or changes in antibiotic therapy\n[13]. The authors of that study concluded that fluctuations in the intestinal microbiota may be necessary to produce the clinical manifestations of T. foetus infection. The intimate relationship between T. foetus and the intestinal microbiota is consistent with the observation that trichomonads are obligate parasites dependent on endogenous bacterial flora and host secretions for acquisition of essential nutrients\n[37]. The results from the current study\u2019s fingerprint analysis are consistent with this observation: T. foetus was observed more commonly than expected as a fingerprint and co-associated with feline coronavirus and C. perfringens, with the potential addition of Giardia spp.",

Since all the cats had documented diarrhoea on sample submission, this finding may indicate that some cats are intrinsically resistant to infection by these 8 enteropathogenic species, but have diarrhoea caused by another mechanism. Alternatively, some cats may not have been exposed to these 8 species, and may have been infected with enteropathogenic species not assessed by this diagnostic panel (for example Campylobacter spp. or Isospora spp.). Further studies will be required to identify potential common factors in this group of cats. However, it is of interest to note that 69% of the diarrhoeic cats with none of the 8 species detected were >12 months old DSH cats. This is consistent with our finding of smaller numbers of enteropathogen species in older DSH cats.",

Previous work has shown that a proportion of cats become chronic carriers following infection with feline coronavirus\n[38-40]. These cats shed the same strain of coronavirus for years\n[38], suggesting this enteropathogen has developed mechanisms to suppress the host immune response, such as induction of TNF\u03b1 release by infected cells and subsequent lymphocyte apoptosis\n[41,42].

Similarities between T. foetus and Giardia spp. have been identified at the molecular level, including molecular and genetic traits, suggesting that they are of sister lineages\n[43]. Pathogenic mechanisms are reported to be similar for Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp., with common features including malabsorption, hypersecretion and disrupted epithelial barrier function\n[44,45]. Considering that pathogenic mechanisms proposed for T. foetus include alterations in the normal flora, adherence to the epithelium, and elaboration of cytokines and enzymes\n[46], infection with Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. could predispose to T. foetus infection.",

Given the retrospective nature of the study, there was no control over the data provided at the time of sample submission, and no follow up in terms of treatment and outcome. Of the samples submitted, 35% were not accompanied by any historical information, and in the remaining 65% it was not possible to rule out clinical signs that were not mentioned on the submission form. For this reason, only cats with a documented history of diarrhoea were included. The lack of background information (for example: housing, diet, number of cats in household, geographical location, show attendance) prevented evaluation of additional risk factors for individual and multiple enteropathogen infection. In addition, the effect of prior treatment (antimicrobials, anthelmintics) on prevalence and patterns of enteropathogen co-infection could not be established. In the absence of a healthy control population, it was not possible to determine the clinical significance of individual or multiple enteropathogen infections in cats. Future prospective studies which include a control population of healthy cats are therefore required.",

It is important to note that even though an organism is detected by PCR, it does not mean it is necessarily the cause of the documented diarrhoea. Furthermore, the highly sensitive aspect of PCR assays may result in positive results in the presence of negligible enteropathogen burdens. PCR has been accepted as the gold standard technique for diagnosis of T. foetus infection in cats\n[27,47], but alternative diagnostic techniques may be preferred for other enteropathogen infections. Another approach to aid diagnosis of the cause of the diarrhoea would be to combine conventional faecal testing (using microscopy for parasitology, and bacterial faecal culture and toxin testing) with a modified PCR panel to document C perfringens alpha toxin gene (quantitative assay), C. perfringens enterotoxin gene (quantitative assay), plus C. coli, and C. jejuni.",
