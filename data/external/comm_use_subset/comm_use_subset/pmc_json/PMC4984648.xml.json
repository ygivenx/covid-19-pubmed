            "text": "Among closely related orbiviruses (Reoviridae family), such as bluetongue virus (BTV), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), and African horse sickness (AHS) virus (AHSV), AHSV is known to cause the most severe morbidity and mortality in infected animals. In susceptible horses, AHSV can cause different forms of disease ranging from mild fever to an acute form, characterized by high fever, depression, respiratory symptoms, severe weight loss, rough hair, lethargy, and apathy, and mortality reaches up to 95% (1). Although AHS is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, occasional outbreaks which had significant social and economic impacts were reported in North Africa, Pakistan, India, Spain, and Portugal. These three orbiviruses are transmitted by midges of Culicoides species, which circulate throughout Europe and the United States, thus increasing the geography of the potential risk of an AHSV outbreak, similar to the risk from BTV and EHDV (2). The genome sequence of AHSV is sufficiently divergent from the genome sequences of BTV and EHDV (3), and unlike BTV, which has 27 serotypes, only 9 serotypes of AHSV (AHSV serotype 1 [AHSV1] to AHSV9) have been distinguished to date. Vaccination with a polyvalent live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) against AHSV is currently used to control the disease in Africa. However, this vaccine is considered unsafe due to adverse side effects and because it often causes viremia and has the potential of reassortment with wild-type AHSV strains, resulting in the possibility of spread of virus infection (4). Therefore, rationally designed safe AHSV vaccine candidates are currently being developed but have not been marketed yet (5\u201310).",

The serotype-determining protein VP2 is the most variable viral protein and the major target of the protective immune response. The core particle consists of two concentric layers: the surface VP7 layer and the inner VP3 layer that encloses the genome of 10 dsRNA segments and a replicase complex of three enzymes, VP1, VP4, and VP6 (11). Comparisons of the sequences of capsid proteins VP2, VP3, VP5, and VP7 of BTV serotype 10 (BTV10) with those from EHDV serotype 1 and AHSV4 have revealed the close structural relationship between these viruses: the inner core proteins, VP3 and VP7, are the most conserved, whereas the outermost proteins, VP2 and VP5, are the most variable (12). Previous structural studies of BTV have revealed the atomic-level details for BTV particle organization (13, 14), and it is expected that the AHSV architecture has a structural organization similar to that of BTV (15). However, at the level of individual proteins, only the structure of a top domain of VP7 has been reported for AHSV4 (16); therefore, a molecular understanding of the structure-function relationship of AHSV proteins is not available and structure-based rational vaccine design for AHSV is not currently possible.",

This strategy has been demonstrated to be efficient for different serotypes by reassortment of the two variable RNA segments that encode the outer capsid proteins VP2 and VP5 with the remaining eight RNA segments of BTV1, including the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) that encodes the defective VP6. Importantly, DISC viruses showed efficient replication in the complemented cell line but no virus production in any other mammalian or insect cell lines. The vaccination of cattle and sheep with such DISC viruses either singly or in a cocktail followed by challenge with virulent BTV strains showed neither a clinical reaction nor any detectable viremia (25).",

First, we employed an RG system for AHSV1 for the production of high titers of viruses solely in a complemented cell line. Once we achieved the defective AHSV1 strain, we utilized this strain as a backbone to develop defective-virus vaccines specific for all nine serotypes. However, in spite of the structural similarity between BTV and AHSV, it became clear that unlike the results obtained with the BTV serotypes, the exchange of only VP2 and VP5 of the other serotypes with the respective segments of AHSV1 did not generate viable reassortant viruses, indicating that the other proteins are not highly conserved between AHSV1 and the different serotypes. It was therefore necessary to exchange additional segments for certain serotypes. These vaccine strains were then tested for their protective efficacies in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-knockout (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) mice. When vaccinated mice were challenged with two virulent strains of AHSV, complete protection against homologous infection was achieved, demonstrating the suitability of the vaccine strains as vaccine candidates.",

The previously published AHSV RG system used transfection of a mixture of two different serotypes, namely, six plasmids expressing AHSV6, followed by 10 T7 RNA transcripts of AHSV4, in order to recover viable virus (23). However, this combination was found to be insufficient for molecular manipulations due to the low efficiency of recovery of virus, which was present at titers of less than 106 PFU/ml. Therefore, it was necessary to identify a well-replicating AHSV serotype with uniform large plaques for virus recovery by the RG system. All nine wt AHSV serotypes were then tested on BSR cells to assess virus titers and plaque phenotypes (Fig. 1). Three distinct groups of AHSV serotypes were observed: a large defined plaque phenotype with high titers (AHSV1), a medium plaque phenotype with high titers (AHSV3, -5, and -6), and a small/undefined plaque phenotype (AHSV2, -4, -7, -8, and -9) with low titers. Four well-replicating AHSV serotypes (AHSV1, -3, -5, and -6) were analyzed for genetic stability via sequencing of several plaque-purified isolates, and three (AHSV3, -5, and -6) showed high genetic diversity. To avoid any complication, plaque-purified AHSV1, which exhibited a large uniform plaque phenotype and high titers (5 \u00d7 108 PFU/ml), was considered to be the most suitable for use in an RG system.",

The protein-coding sequences of VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, VP7, NS1, and NS2, which form the primary replicase complex, were used to generate expression plasmids under the control of the pCAG promoter (24). For the RG system, we tested several conditions to mimic the preformation of the primary replication complex. The transfection of 3 to 7 expression plasmids followed by the transfection of exact copies of 10 T7 RNA transcripts was performed. A combination of 5 expression plasmids (expressing VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, and NS2) was found to be sufficient to generate high numbers of AHSV plaques and was used throughout the subsequent experiments (Fig. 2A). When an isolated plaque (recAHSV1) was amplified in BSR cells, virus titers were as high as 4 \u00d7 108 PFU/ml, equivalent to that of the wt virus. Both the plaque morphology and genomic dsRNA profile were similar to those of the wt AHSV1 (Fig. 2B).

Therefore, we decided to develop VP6-deficient viruses, which required the generation of a cell line complemented with VP6. The ability of trans-complementation of VP6 in the RG system of the related virus BTV has led to the development of VP6-deficient mutant viruses that are able to replicate in the complemented cell line but not in BSR or insect KC cells (18, 22). Therefore, we created a BSR cell line expressing AHSV1 VP6 (the BSR-VP6 cell line) by electroporation of BSR cells with pCAG-AHSV1VP6, followed by puromycin selection.

            "text": "For defective-virus recovery, BSR-VP6 cells were transfected with the complete set of T7 RNAs of AHSV1, where S9 was replaced by S9multistop and, depending on the serotype, the combinations S2-S6, S2-S6-S7, S2-S6-S7-S3, or S2-S6-S7-S3-S10 were used to replace the equivalent segments of def-AHSV1. The criteria for the selection of defective viruses were the plaque size (clear plaques after 2 to 3 days of incubation at 35\u00b0C) and the final titer of the plaque-purified viruses determined using the BSR-VP6 cell line (107 to 108 PFU/ml). These requirements were chosen to minimize any possible pressure to avoid recombination and instability of the modified dsRNA genome. As expected, the exchange of only S2 (VP2) resulted in either no virus recovery (def-AHSV2, -3, and -5) or very poor recovery with titers in the range of 2 \u00d7 103 to 5 \u00d7 105 (def-AHSV4, -6, -7, -8, and -9). These observations are consistent with those for previously published AHSV reassortants based on S2 exchange (7). To develop stable and high-titer defective viruses of the different serotypes, replacement of two outer capsid proteins with def-AHSV1 was not sufficient for all serotypes. While well-replicating def-AHSV8 and def-AHSV9 could be achieved by the reassortment with only 2 segments (S2 and S6) encoding the outer shell proteins VP2 and VP5, def-AHSV3 and def-AHSV4 were achieved only when, in addition to S2 and S6, the homologous S7, encoding the scaffolding VP7 protein for deposition of VP2 and VP5, was also exchanged (Table 1). Three additional serotypes were created by reassortment with 4 segments (S2, S6, S7, S3), resulting in def-AHSV5, def-AHSV6, and def-AHSV7. This set was created by complete replacement of the major structural protein shell. Further, to generate well-replicating (in BSR-VP6 cells) reassortant def-AHSV2, five segments (S2, S6, S7, S3, S10) had to be replaced to achieve high titers on the complemented BSR-VP6 cell line (Table 1). In each case, when these required combinations of segments were not replaced, defective viruses (AHSV2, 3-, -4, -5, -6, and -7) were poorly recovered and these viruses exhibited a small plaque phenotype and low titers, ranging from 104 to 106 PFU/ml. Therefore, these were excluded from the subsequent studies. The schematic representation of all selected defective viruses is summarized in Fig. 4A and B. All 9 defective viruses were passaged 5 times at an MOI of 0.1 in the complementing BSR-VP6 cell line, confirming at each step that none of the tested stocks was able to replicate on wild-type BSR cells. To assess the stability and integrity of reassortant-defective viruses, dsRNA was extracted from stocks of the initial virus recovery and the final (fifth) passage. Each dsRNA sample exhibited the correct mobility (Fig. 4C). Further, RT-PCR and sequencing also validated the authenticity of the RNA segments in all defective-virus strains.",

Derm cells) at a high MOI and measuring the virus titers at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. The results demonstrated that these defective viruses (def-AHSV1 to def-AHSV9) were not able to grow in any of these three cell lines (Fig. 5B to D). To ensure that there was no delayed replication, all infected cells were incubated for an additional 7 days; however, no signs of infection were detected (data not shown). When the results are taken together, we conclude that all nine defective viruses grew to high titers (between 3 \u00d7 107 and 1 \u00d7 108 PFU/ml) in the complemented cell line (Table 1) but did not produce viable virions in normal BSR, KC, and E.

Considering that the standard vaccination dose per horse is 106 to 107 virus particles, for a quadrivalent vaccine the maximum injected volume will not exceed 0.5 to 1 ml, since 2 \u00d7 107 cells infected with each def-AHSV serotype should provide at least \u223c75 to 200 doses, suggesting that such productivity is appropriate for clinical applications and mass production.

No adverse side effects were observed after vaccination, and the body weights of immunized and control animals showed no significant differences (a maximum 10% variation was observed for all groups). At 3 weeks after the second immunization, vaccinated and control animals were challenged subcutaneously with virulent AHSV1 or AHSV4. Protection indicators included body weight measurements, survival times, and blood and tissue AHSV-specific RNA levels. The group of 6 control mice, which were not vaccinated but which were challenged with AHSV4, started to lose weight from day 3 or 4 postchallenge onwards. Four animals were euthanized at day 7 after infection (because of severe weight loss, rough hair, and apathetic behavior), and the two remaining mice were euthanized on day 8. The nonvaccinated mouse group infected with AHSV1, representing a less virulent serotype, showed no clinical signs. Also, groups of mice vaccinated with either def-AHSV1 or def-AHSV4 showed no clinical signs (Fig. 6A).",

Although live-attenuated polyvalent vaccines protecting against almost all AHSV serotypes, except serotypes 5 and 9, are commercially available, these vaccine strains have a high risk of reassortment with field isolates, which results in the introduction of new virus serotypes into countries where AHSV is not endemic (32). Therefore, in the last 2 decades, various attempts have been made to develop safe and efficacious AHSV vaccines; however, to date none of these has been developed into a commercial product. For successful vaccine preparation, in addition to safety and efficacy, it is essential that some other criteria also be met, including technical simplicity and reproducibility, ease of scaling up of production, downstream processing of the manufactured vaccine, and most importantly, cost-effective vaccine manufacture, particularly for animal vaccines. Moreover, vaccines that could allow the differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) are also highly desirable. Although subunit vaccines based on purified proteins are compliant with the need for DIVA and safe, they generally do not provide sufficient and long-lasting protection and their production is costly. Orbivirus-like particles are safe and provide sufficient protection but require complex preparation methods and suffer from low yields and problems with reproducibility. Although attenuated virus-based chimeras created by the exchange of outer capsid protein VP2 alone or in combination with VP5 have good immunological potential, so far they have demonstrated significant variability in virus titers (7), which are often as low as 105 to 106 PFU/ml, which precludes their further development into a cost-efficient product. Therefore, in this study, we prioritized the virus productivity parameters to overcome these deficiencies for the generation of AHSV vaccine candidates.",

For this purpose, the most efficiently replicating plaque-purified AHSV1 variant was first selected as it provided the highest titers and had a defined large plaque phenotype. Second, the genome segments of this AHSV1 variant were subcloned and sequenced, and an efficient RG system, along with optimized virus recovery parameters, was established. It was found that the double-transfection approach, in which cells were first transfected with DNA expression vectors, which provided high-level expression of the primary replication complex components of 5 proteins, followed by transfection with in vitro-cotranscribed RNAs representing exact copies of the virus segments, was the most efficient method for AHSV recovery, similar to that previously reported for BTV (33). To create replication-defective virus, we targeted disruption of the ORF of the essential replicative enzyme VP6, as well as the overlapping ORF of the less well-studied NS4 protein, in the coding region of segment S9 of AHSV1 by introducing multiple stop codons. Notably, mutations introduced into the S9multistop segment should be sufficient to allow differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals by quantitative RT-PCR; this, however, needs to be confirmed in future experiments. To support the replication of a defective virus, it was necessary to establish a complemented BSR cell line expressing functional VP6. These cells were highly efficient in supporting the propagation of defective AHSV1. Therefore, AHSV1 was considered suitable as a backbone for the generation of defective virus strains for the remaining eight serotypes (AHSV2 to AHSV9) by exchanging the RNA segments encoding serotype-determining capsid proteins of the other serotypes. Similar strategies to create replication-deficient virus strains have been previously reported for BTV (22, 25), adenovirus (34), and herpes simplex virus and other viruses (reviewed in reference 39). Such defective viruses have an advantage as vaccines because their initial infection site mimics replicating virus, thus providing a strong and specific immune response.",

            "text": "Since during viral infection the majority of a neutralizing immune response is based on the VP2 protein, it would be logical to assume that exchange of the corresponding segment would be sufficient. However, since the productivity of a vaccine strains is also critical, we sought to optimize conditions to generate vaccine strains. We found that for eight AHSV serotypes (AHSV2 to AHSV9) the rescue of corresponding viruses using an established RG system was possible for some serotypes but that the titers of the viral stocks were unacceptably lower (below 5 \u00d7 105 PFU/ml) than those of the parental virus. Such a low titer of the rescued virus not only would impede its further development into a cost-efficient vaccine candidate but also is indicative of the problems associated with virus assembly, dissemination, and, possibly, genetic stability. It can be expected that swapping the large, most variable RNA segment, segment S2, to alter the serotype of the virus particle may have a number of consequences. The orbivirus particle is made up of three concentric layers of proteins, whereas VP2 makes contacts with the outer capsid protein VP5 and the inner capsid protein VP7. Therefore, amino acid changes in the replaced VP2 may disturb its interactions with other capsid proteins, thus influencing the stability of the assembled virion. Additionally, orbiviral RNA segments not only need to interact with each other (36) but also may interact with the packaging protein during assembly, so the integrity of the native S2 can be crucial. Therefore, variations at the nucleotide sequence level may also result in a reduced efficiency of core assembly for heterologous virus. To this end, current knowledge about nucleotide-level requirements for RNA packaging and atomic-level structural details about AHSV virion organization is clearly lagging behind, precluding the rational design and optimization of reassortant virus particles. Therefore, we used a semirational approach by replacing S2 (VP2) along with S5 (VP5), S2 with S5 and S7 (VP7), and S2-S5-S7 with S3 (VP3) or S2-S5-S7-S3 and S10, as S10 is also highly variable among different AHSV serotypes. We assumed that the advantage of the replacement of S10 can be 2-fold, because S10 RNA has been reported to be especially important during RNA packaging (36), whereas its ORF encodes the NS3 protein, which is implicated in the virus budding process (35). By testing various combinations, we selected virus variants that efficiently replicated to titers equivalent to those of the wt virus. Interestingly, the number of segments needed to be exchanged in the backbone virus differed for different serotypes, with the extreme case being AHSV2, which required the exchange of five segments, including S10 (NS3). These data are in agreement with previously published reports on BTV, where interaction between VP2 and NS3 has been shown to be important for efficient virus egress (37). However, the possibility that RNA-RNA interactions are involved in the efficiency of reassortment between AHSV serotypes should also be considered.",

When two different defective viruses, including one reassortant-defective virus, were assessed, both vaccinated groups of mice demonstrated significantly decreased levels of viremia, in contrast to the control nonvaccinated groups, which showed high levels of viremia and/or clinical signs. Although these data are highly encouraging, further vaccination/challenge experiments with different combinations of serotypes will need to be assessed using not only IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice but also horses.",

More recently, one of the LAV strains, AHSV4LP, which has a deletion of NS3/NS3A, was employed as a potential vaccine development platform (7). However, a recent report on another RNA virus has demonstrated the reversion to virulence of an attenuated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus lacking E protein after it was propagated in mice (38). Therefore, the in vitro complementation of a missing protein would represent a safer AHSV vaccine platform with a minimized genetic pressure toward the reversion to virulence. Notably, in this study, we avoided deletion of the genes but disrupted the ORF of AHSV S9, coding for VP6 and NS4, by introducing multiple stop codons. Multiple passages of the vaccine strains in a complemented cell line did not reveal any changes in the mutated S9, strongly suggesting that the mutated ORF is unlikely to revert. Also, our results have demonstrated that all nine defective AHSVs were able to replicate in the complemented cell line to titers similar to those of the wt AHSV serotypes. Most importantly, defective viruses were unable to propagate in normal cells, whether they were of mammalian or insect origin. Unlike live-attenuated vaccine strains, the def-AHSV vaccine candidates are replication deficient in normal cells, and their activity is limited to the primary expression only of viral proteins, making the risks of recombination with circulating field strains minimal. As a result, such vaccines provide a safer option for horses than the current live-attenuated virus vaccines and have equivalent or improved protective efficiency.",
