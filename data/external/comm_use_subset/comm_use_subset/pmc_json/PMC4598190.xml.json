            "text": "The influenza A RNA virus (Orthomyxoviridae) is a significant threat to human health and the global economy by causing morbidity and mortality through frequent epidemics and sporadic pandemics [1]. Seasonal influenza viruses such as seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 infect the cells lining the upper respiratory tract. These viruses typically cause mild clinical symptoms including rhinorrhea, fever, and myalgia [2]. Unlike seasonal influenza, highly pathogenic viruses such as avian H5N1 are able to infect organs outside the upper respiratory tract such as the lower lungs, intestines, and brain, causing a more severe illness [3]. The localization of influenza virus infection is largely influenced by the distribution of the virus cellular receptors where the \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid receptor is predominantly expressed in the upper respiratory tract and \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid receptors in the lower [4]. In 2009, a novel variant pandemic H1N1 influenza A (2009 H1N1) virus emerged from Mexico that targets both the upper and lower respiratory system [4]. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, infants, nursing-mothers, and pregnant women were considered to be at high risk of developing severe disease [5\u20137] and viral or bacterial pneumonia [8]. Pediatric and pregnant/postpartum mother mortalities were sharply increased in the 2009\u20132010 influenza season compared to previous seasons [9,10]. Importantly, the underlying mechanisms leading to severe disease in mothers and infants have not been elucidated, suggesting the need for an animal model.",

Through breastfeeding, mothers provide nutrients, beneficial bacteria, and immune protection to the infant by transfer of cells, antibodies, proteins, and sugars through breast milk [11,12]. The consumption of breast milk has a central role establishing infant health and disease susceptibility by influencing the infant gastrointestinal and immune systems [13,14]. The maternal breast is a highly structured organ and an area of frequent traffic between infant and mother. Fluid exchange also occurs from infant to mother during breastfeeding as liquid can infiltrate the mammary gland through retrograde flux of the nipple [15]. It is currently thought that maternal plasma cells producing antibodies for breast milk delivery are a consequence of cellular migration from the maternal gut to the breast without a host-pathogen interaction occurring within the mammary gland [16]. Although most infants worldwide are breastfed, little is known regarding pathogen transmission between nursing-mothers and infants, breast susceptibility to pathogens, or the local immune response within the breast due to lack of a translatable research model [5].",

While breastfeeding has been shown to protect against long-term breast cancer development, postpregnancy breast cancer is hypothesized to be a consequence of breast remodeling and involution associated with lactation [17,18]. Infectious breast tumor etiologies have been hypothesized as nucleic acids from viruses, such as human papilloma virus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have been recovered from within breast tumors [19\u201322]. These viruses express oncoproteins that inactivate the host\u2019s basic cellular activity by blocking tumor repressor proteins or promote cellular transformation [23]. Furthermore, these viruses may have a significant latency period allowing long periods of viral presence without clearance.",

We developed a ferret model of influenza transmission in the mother-infant dyad (infant-to-mother ferret influenza transmission model) with the aim of investigating virus transmission and immune consequences during influenza infection in this highly susceptible population. Ferrets are considered to be the most appropriate animal model for human influenza pathogenesis, vaccine optimization, and antiviral development [28,29]. Ferrets are also used to investigate transmissibility of the influenza virus due to the similarity of the ferret and human respiratory biology [29\u201331]. Previously, we developed both \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201caged\u201d ferret models of influenza pathogenesis due to shared characteristics of development and aging between ferrets and humans [32,33]. Building on these studies, we developed a novel infant-mother ferret influenza model utilizing nursing-mother ferrets and their 4-week-old feeding-infants (infant-mother ferret influenza transmission model) to investigate the host-pathogen interactions of influenza virus infection in the mother-infant dyad. Our investigation showed established virus infection within the mammary gland and viral shedding in breast milk suggesting a novel mechanism of influenza virus transmission.",

Necropsies were performed at Day 3, 4, 7, and 14 post-inoculation or if an animal was removed from the study (reached weight cut-off or had succumbed to illness). Inoculated infant ferrets developed illness leading to mortality starting with a high fever at 104% of baseline temperature (p<0.05) Day 2 post-infant-inoculation. Infants then developed hypothermia (Day 6) (Fig 1B). All infants reached weight cut-off (lost 20% of original weight; p<0.05) or died by Day 8 post-infant-inoculation (Fig 1C and 1D). Four days post-infant-inoculation, nursing-mother ferrets also developed influenza-like symptoms including increased body temperature (103% of baseline). Mother weights significantly decreased by 13% Day 4 post-infant-inoculation (Fig 1C). Weight did not recover by study end and one mother reached cut-off (Fig 1D). The weight and temperature of the mothers of mock inoculated control infants are presented in S1 Table which showed mothers did not develop symptoms post-mock-inoculation of infant ferrets.",

Na\u00efve cage mates of inoculated adult ferrets began shedding virus in NW Day 3 post-inoculation.

H&E (hematoxylin & eosin) staining of mother lungs revealed delayed, airway-localized inflammation (Fig 2C). Day 3/4 post-infant-inoculation, mother lungs showed areas of minimal infiltrating leukocytes (black arrows: diffuse areas; green arrows: dense infiltration) (Fig 2C). Increased leukocyte infiltration was observed Day 7 post-infant-inoculation where sites of inflammation were dense in mononuclear cells with lymphocyte-like morphology. Infected mother lungs were compared to the lungs of adult male ferrets directly inoculated with Cal/07 through the intranasal route (Fig 2C, right column). The lungs collected from mothers of mock inoculated infants were similar in architecture to that of mock inoculated adult male ferrets. The adult lungs collected Day 3/4 post-direct-inoculation had markedly more leukocyte infiltrates compared to the mother lungs at Day 3/4 post-infant-inoculation (Fig 2C). Taken together with the above data, these findings indicated that 2009 H1N1 transmission from infant to mother led to severe respiratory disease with upper and lower respiratory tract infection and accompanying lung pathology but on a delayed time course compared to direct adult infections.",

We intranasally inoculated nursing-mothers with Cal/07 at 105 EID50 and observed clinical symptoms as well as determined respiratory viral load and pathogenesis. Following inoculation, nursing-mother ferrets developed a biphasic fever which spiked at 104% (baseline temperature) (Fig 3B) Day 3 post-mother-inoculation. Weight loss was observed in the inoculated mothers which reached nadir on Day 7 post-mother-inoculation at 89% of original weight (p<0.05) (Fig 3C). Although mother mortality did not occur, the infants of inoculated mothers lost weight, had increased temperature, and all died or reached cut-off by Day 11 post-mother-inoculation (Fig 3D). The weight of infants of inoculated nursing-mothers began to decline on Day 3 (Fig 3C). Although infants did not have a significant increase in temperature they did become hypothermic as they reached mortality (Fig 3B). Virus was detected in mother NW Day 1 post-mother-inoculation (peak Day 2 at 6 TCID50/ml (Log10)) and infant viral shedding began Day 3 (Fig 3E). Live influenza virus was detected in the lungs of infants reaching weight cut-off or succumbing to illness between Day 5 and Day 8 post-mother-inoculation (3\u20138 TCID50 (Log10)) (Fig 3F). Significant pathology was also detected in lungs of infants feeding from 2009 H1N1 inoculated nursing-mothers Day 7 post-mother-inoculation. The lungs were characterized by areas of dense leukocyte infiltration and alveoli destruction (Fig 4). In summary, these data indicate that influenza transmission was also possible from mother to feeding-infants causing upper and lower respiratory tract infection and respiratory tract disease.",

It is not known if Bystander glands were previously virus infected and were able to clear the virus prior to collection and gene profiling. Parallel analyses of Bystander mammary glands (H1N1- at time of collection) partially recapitulated responses detected in H1N1+ MG (S4 Fig; S4 Table). Both H1N1+ and Bystander gland response signatures were characterized by upregulation of proliferation, remodeling, and immune response associated genes (S5 Table). Downregulation of sugar/lipid metabolism genes and STAT5A/B was also a shared feature of both H1N1+ and Bystander glands (S4 Fig; S5 Table). However, Bystander gland responses differed from H1N1+ MG as the PPAR/Hedgehog/Adipocytokine pathway was downregulated and the immune responses were less robust.

Induction of genes typical of the influenza antiviral response [40] such as CXCL10 and CCL2 were seen Day 6/7 post-infant-inoculation in H1N1+ MG (Fig 7C). The immune response also differed in the mammary gland compared to the lung. The response in mammary tissue was characterized by decreased expression of lymphocyte-associated genes such as CD3e, IL2Ra, CD4, AICDA (Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase) [41]; IL4 and IL1\u03b2 upregulation; and unchanged IL6 expression (Fig 7C).

To this end we inoculated three cell lines of cultured human epithelial breast cells with Cal/07 strain (2009 H1N1) (in the absence of exogenous proteases) to visualize the virus life-cycle in inoculated cells, assess the viral kinetics, and determine cell viability post-inoculation (Fig 11). \u201cNormal\u201d non-tumorigenic (MCF-10A) and adenocarcinoma (MCF-7 and MCDA-MB-231) human epithelial breast cell lines were used to eliminate single cell type biases. To visualize the virus within the cell and determine virus subcellular localization, inoculated cells were stained for Influenza A Virus (IAV) NP (blue), nucleus (green), and actin filaments (red) (Fig 11A). Positive NP stain was used to determine if viral replication may be occurring within the nucleus. At 24 h post-inoculation influenza NP was detected in the nucleus (white arrows) of all three cell types, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-10A, indicated by co-localization of the nuclear stain (green) with NP staining (blue) (Fig 11A). Furthermore, marked punctate NP accumulation at the plasma membrane was observed in MCF-10A cells (yellow arrows) and to a smaller degree in the other cell types. vRNA was significantly increased in all cells types between 3 and 24 h post-inoculation by ~10 fold (Fig 11B). Cell viability analysis showed significant drops in cell viability of MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 post-inoculation reaching ~35% viability at the 72 h time point compared to uninoculated cells at the same incubation (Fig 11C). To assess productive infection, live virus was quantified from collected supernatant at each time point. Live viral titers ranged between 3 and 4 TCID50/ml (Log10) for all cell types (Fig 11D). Baseline control (BC) wells had minimal or no detectable live virus. Together, these results suggest that the 2009 H1N1 virus was able to enter \u201cnormal\u201d human breast cells leading to virus replication and productive infection.",

We found the influenza virus transmitted between nursing-mothers and infants in a bidirectional manner by respiratory and mammary transmission mechanisms. Transmission led to severe lower respiratory disease and mortality. Ferret mammary glands as well as human breast cells were both susceptible to infection and were able to replicate the virus efficiently suggesting mammary glands have the potential to function as a transmission vessel. Substantial changes in gene regulation were observed in H1N1 positive mammary tissue including induction of milk cessation genes and oncogenic pathways accompanying tissue pathogenesis. Influenza has caused high mortality in children (>280/season) and pregnant/postpartum women (~24%) during the influenza season in the United States [8,10] and our study may be used for future investigations of immune responses and therapeutic testing in these populations.",

Our findings support investigation into the transmission dynamics of influenza and other childhood viruses during breastfeeding. Since retrograde flux of the mammary glands can allow liquid from infants to enter mammary ducts, viral transmission from the infected infants into the breast is possible via breastfeeding. The susceptibility of mammary glands to common pathogens may have both beneficial and deleterious long-term consequences which should be considered in future studies. As well, since vRNA was found in infant feces as well as in infant respiratory tracts, both respiratory and gastrointestinal introduction of the influenza virus are possible as routes of infection from mother to infant. Our gene expression profiling in virus positive mammary glands indicated induction of oncogenic pathways as well as immune responses [19\u201322]. Infection in mammary tissue may also evoke effective long-term adaptive immune responses. This may be a response conserved through evolution to serve as an advantage for future fecundity of that mother enabling protection by immune memory.",

Since live virus was shed in the milk, this suggested that infection may also be possible by contact with mother\u2019s milk. Although we showed 2009 H1N1 virus presence in the mammary gland by four independent methods, immunohistochemistry, tissue viral load assay, milk viral load assay, and qRT-PCR, the kinetics of the virus expression in these assays were not always correlative. Since the milk vRNA and milk live viral load data were not aliquots of the same sample it is possible the amount of virus shed in milk may not be regular throughout the day or in each infection. RNA extraction from milk samples presented challenges due to the fat content of the milk which were not encountered in live viral load assessment of either milk or mammary gland tissue which may explain the higher live viral loads. As well, milk viral quantifications may differ from that of the mammary gland tissue viral quantification since virus in the milk may be diluted or concentrated dependent on the fullness of the mammary gland at the time of milking. Although these data did not directly correlate, the presence of virus in milk and within the mammary glands was a consistent finding.",

By directly inoculating the mammary gland, we were able to eliminate the possibility of respiratory transmission in the initial portion of the experiment by isolating the infection within the mammary. Controlling the experiment through other means such as the addition a non-lactating adult to the cage of mother and infants brings ethical considerations as the presence of another adult would put the infant ferrets in danger. In our inoculation experiments, virus began shedding in milk Day 2 post-mammary-inoculation and was present in the infant NW between 2 and 4 days post-mammary-inoculation. Since virus was not detected in mother NW until later in the time course, this data suggested that the infants received the virus from infected mammary glands, not through the mother\u2019s respiration. Virus transmitted from the mammary gland led to severe disease and infant mortality despite the atypical influenza transmission mode. Since infants are susceptible to respiratory tract infection by various microbes present in mammary glands/milk, such as bacteria and yeast [43\u201346], our findings showing respiratory infection from pathogens present in breast milk may have implications into possible sources of bacteria that may participate in influenza-bacterial co-infections in neonates. Moreover, influenza infection in mammary tissue may exacerbate or increase mastitis incidence in mothers and should be investigated in relation to resident and foreign microbial populations. Together, these results give insight into mechanisms which may contribute to influenza severity in infants and nursing-mothers.",

Pregnancy associated breast cancer (PABC) has been hypothesized to be a consequence of breast remodeling that occurs during pregnancy-lactation cycles and mammary involution [17,18]. We showed increases in oncogene pathways and involution programing in influenza positive glands. Breast involution is characterized by the presence of proteolytic cleavage, apoptosis, and leukocyte recruitment (i.e., macrophages) for secretory alveolar cell removal [17,47]. Our gene expression analysis implicated significant presence of M2 macrophages in influenza infected mammary glands by the upregulation of the M2 specific transcripts CD163, CLEC7A, M5R1, CD209, LGMN, and MRC1. M2 macrophages have a similar phenotype as tumor associated macrophages (TAM), since they regulate MMPs and support a microenvironment favorable for oncogenesis [47]. In agreement with this profile we showed increased MMP1, MMP2, MMP8, MMP11 and MMP14 in the H1N1+ MGs. We also found oncogenic collagen and cell attachment gene signatures upregulated in our data: COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL4A6, Integrins (ITGB6) and cell-matrix interaction proteins (SPP1)[17]. Several of these collagen genes have previously been shown to be associated with both cancer progression and involution in mouse models of mammary involution [17,48,49]. As further validation and discovery, future studies should investigate the full transcriptomics during influenza virus infection in active mammary glands of the ferret to eliminate any biases of the canine microarray. Although no structural or tissue pathological evidence for cancer progression was found in our studies possibly due to the short time frame of the study, clear tissue evidence of milk cessation was seen.",

Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide [52] and viral nucleic acids have been found in breast tumors i.e., bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) [19,51]. Viruses may instigate cancer progression through oncogenic viral proteins or by induction of chronic inflammation [19,53,54]. We found induction of genes typical of influenza antiviral responses (CXCL10) [40] as well as cancer associated genes upregulated in H1N1+ MG suggesting mammary glands. As our expression analysis showed the induction of a cancer-promoting microenvironment in mammary glands infected with the influenza virus, it is important to note that viruses that have been found to be directly oncogenic, such as HPV, have infectious cycles differing from that of the influenza virus [23]. Therefore we hypothesize if long-term biological networks are upregulated during influenza infection in breast tissue then those genetic changes would most likely be due to inflammation. The long-term implications of pathogen infection in breast tissue are not known but our data suggests influenza infection leads to short-term pathogenic genetic reprograming within mammary glands.",

Although the importance of breastfeeding cannot be overstated [11,12], our findings may impact the management of influenza infection in the mother-infant dyad. Reports have shown most pregnant women with severe influenza infection did not receive the yearly influenza vaccine [10]. Our data reinforces the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Our investigation also suggests that continued breastfeeding during mother or infant influenza infection could lead to breast infection, live virus shedding, and breast pathogenesis. Short-term milk expression by breast pumping with possible pasteurization may be an appropriate strategy for management of influenza infection in the mother-infant dyad. Previously, a guideline has been investigated for the management of influenza transmission in the mother-infant dyad. Since these guidelines had only considered the possibility of respiratory transmission, further investigation and guideline development may be important [56].",

            "text": "Although not much is known regarding viral transmission through breastfeeding, great efforts have been devoted to modeling mother-to-child HIV transmission due to the importance of breastfeeding in HIV high incidence countries [57]. HIV in breast milk exists in both cell-associated (leukocytes) and cell-free forms [34]. Our data suggests that the influenza virus infects glandular epithelial cells whereas HIV primarily targets leukocytes leading to systemic circulation. Our observation here implies novel dynamics of influenza transmission through breastfeeding is a mechanistically different mode of virus transmission in the mother-infant dyad and a formally unidentified system of immune response regulation within the mammary gland for the local production and direct delivery of pathogen specific antibodies. This suggests there is much to be understood regarding the mother-infant relationship and pathogen transmission. Recently, MERS-CoV has been speculated to be transmitted from camels to humans through consumption of camel milk [58]. Together these findings support a hypothesis that respiratory viruses may have the ability to also infect mammary tissue, including human breast cells, possibly due to a shared branched architecture and cellular structure of epithelial cells in lungs and mammary glands.",

Briefly, nasal washes were diluted 1:10 in vDMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% BSA, 25mM glucose, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 4mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin, and 1 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-Trypsin) followed by the half log serial dilution in quadruplicate with vDMEM on MDCK cells in 96-well flat-bottom plates (SARSTEDT, Inc., Saint-Leonard, QC, Canada). Tissues were processed similarly and homogenized 1:10 (w/v) in sDMEM (vDMEM excluding 1% BSA) on ice and centrifuged before titration of the homogenates on MDCK cells. Before inoculation, MDCK cells were maintained in the log-phase at low-passage numbers and grown in cDMEM (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 6 mM glutamine, 1 mM non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin). The day before viral sample titration, 2x104 MDCK cells were seeded into each well to reach 95% confluence on the next day. After a two-hour incubation of titrated viral samples with MDCK cells at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, samples were aspirated and replaced with fresh vDMEM followed by a six-day incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. On Day 6 post-incubation, supernatants were examined for presence of virus by haemagglutination of 0.5% turkey erythrocytes (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA, USA). The viral titers were determined as the reciprocal of the dilution resulting in 50% HA positivity in the unit of TCID50/ml represented in log10 base. Viral titers in cell culture supernatants were also determined to investigate capacity of mammary epithelial cells to produce infectious virus in vitro. Cell culture supernatants were loaded directly and serially diluted as described above. Assay upper and lower limits of detection depended on sample availability and/or expected viral titer and varied between experiment types. Lower limits of detection are indicated in all viral load figures by a dashed line. Upper limits of detection were 106.75 TCID50/ml for mammary epithelial cell supernatant assessments, 107.75 and 1013.75 for milk assessments in Fig 5D and Fig 9F, respectively, and 107.25 for all nasal wash and tissue assessments except for S1C Fig (107.75).

Complementary RNA (cRNA) was generated using 3\u2019 IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Canine Genome 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), as previously described [40]. We have previously used and validated canine arrays for the investigation of ferret global gene expression profiling [60\u201364]. We demonstrated high levels of homology (average of 89% identity) between 30 canine and ferret nucleotide sequences [60]. Data sets for H1N1+ mammary glands, bystander mammary glands, and lungs were pre-processed independently with quantile normalization, variance stabilization, and log2 transformation. For genes represented by multiple probes on the array, the probe with highest total signal in H1N1+ mammary gland and lung datasets were selected for analysis. Two parallel analyses were applied A H1N1+ and bystander mammary gland datasets. Global clustering analyses were performed by one-way hierarchical clustering (Pearson\u2019s correlation) of all significantly differentially regulated genes (p-value<0.05 Student\u2019s t-test unpaired, equal variances, fold change \u2265 |1.5| fold) and functional annotation of generated clusters. Global pathway gene enrichment analyses were performed by functional annotation of genes exhibiting significant changes in expression at either Days 3/4 or 6/7 in either dataset, using the KEGG Pathway database. DAVID Bioinformatics Resource v6.7, described previously [40] was used for functional annotation and enrichment score profiling. Clustergrams in Fig 7B were manually selected as representative genes for signaling pathways and gene networks prominently represented in global analyses. Genes included in clustergrams were identified as significantly differentially regulated members of related KEGG-defined signaling pathways with the exception of Macrophage and Milk Production clustergrams which were generated by manual selection of representative genes. Full clustergrams of all significantly differentially regulated genes for each KEGG-signaling pathway identified in Fig 7are included in S2 Fig\n",
