The program includes seven Proteomics Research Centers (PRCs) conducting state-of-the-art high-throughput research on pathogens of concern in biodefense and emerging/reemerging infectious diseases, as well as a Biodefense Resource Center for public dissemination of the pathogen and host data, biological reagents, protocols, and other project deliverables.",

The centers have generated a heterogeneous set of experimental data using various technologies loosely defined as proteomic, but encompassing genomic, structural, immunology and protein interaction technologies, as well as more standard cell and molecular biology techniques used to validate potential targets identified via high-throughput methods. In addition to data, the PRCs have provided biological reagents such as clones, antibodies and engineered bacterial strains, other deliverables include standard operating procedures (SOPs) and new technologies such as instrumental methods and software tools and finally publications related to all of these activities.",

In particular, due to the breadth of the program, the potential user community is quite broad, from technology or informatics experts who may want to reanalyze the data or develop better algorithms, to a wide group of biomedical scientists who are interested in mining the data for their own studies or just finding new information on a protein or gene of interest quickly and easily.",

Having most of this information accessible in one place can facilitate knowledge discovery and modeling of biological systems. Like many problems in data integration, it is easy to know the general outline of what we want, but often much harder to implement and navigate the information, especially if the original data crosses disciplinary, laboratory and institutional boundaries. Here we describe in detail a protein-centric approach for systems integration of such a large and heterogeneous set of data from the NIAID Biodefense Proteomics program, and present scientific case studies to illustrate its application to facilitate the basic understanding of pathogen-host interactions and for the identification of potential candidates for therapeutic or diagnostic targets. Several scientific use cases are presented that illustrate how one can search varied experimental data from different laboratories and even ones researching different infectious organism and their hosts to make potentially useful connections that could lead to new hypotheses and discoveries.",

In practice a protein-centric approach works well as proteins occupy a middle ground molecularly between gene and transcript information and higher levels of molecular and cellular structure and organization. Proteins are often the functional molecules in biological processes described by pathways, molecular interactions and other networks. Protein families, in turn, have proven to be invaluable in studying evolution and for inferring and transferring functional annotation across species.",

Examples of database identifiers used include Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ accessions and locus tags, UniGene accessions, RefSeq accessions, IPI accessions, NCBI gi numbers and IDs unique to a sequencing center or organism-specific database. The first step was to map all experimental results to a common representation of a protein. This was achieved by mapping all protein and gene IDs and names to iProClass proteins. The majority of the mapping using IDs from public resources was done using mapping services and tables provide on the Protein Information Resource (PIR) web site (http://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/search/idmapping.shtml) and FTP site (ftp://ftp.pir.georgetown.edu/databases/iproclass/). However, some mapping problems needed to be addressed either by automated rules, direct sequence comparisons or manual analysis and annotation.",

            "text": "Mapping difficulties fell into 4 categories: 1) One-to-many mappings: a common problem, especially when eukaryotic host proteins derived from alternate splicing or viral polyproteins are involved. UniProtKB usually merges information on alternate splice forms or polyproteins, which helped minimize this problem for our purposes, but in cases where multiple mappings exist, we selected as most informative the entry in the manually reviewed UniProtKB/SwissProt section; if no SwissProt entry was found, the longer sequence in UniProtKB/TrEMBL section was selected. Users could always find the alternate mappings via the iProClass related sequences link on the MPD entry page to precompiled BLAST results on all iProClass sequences. 2) Retired sequences: genomic sequences from databases such as RefSeq, IPI, or UniGene are not static and, as information changes, some gene predictions and translations are retired with each new build. Retired sequences often required manual mapping by a curator to match original gene or peptide results to current protein sequences. Primarily UniParc (UniProt sequence archive) [15] was used for this purpose. 3) Protein sequences not available in iProClass or any public repository: this occurred most often with Toxoplasma gondii whose genome sequencing was still in progress and stable builds were not yet available. However, the problem also occurred in some well-characterized organisms like Vibrio cholera and Bacillus anthracis. Several data sets contained information on annotated but not translated pseudogenes. In the case of Vibrio cholera, 21 of 48 pseudogenes cloned and sequenced by the Harvard Institute of Proteomics did not contain the annotated point mutation or frame shift and appeared to produce full-length proteins [16]. In the case of Bacillus anthracis, microarrays containing probes for 82 of 192 annotated pseudogenes also showed significant changes in RNA expression in response to infection or other treatments [17], [18], [19]. In these cases, new database entries were created in the MPD to house the results. 4) Alternate species or strain representations: several experimental data sets reported sequence identifiers for strains or variants other than the one used in the experimental sample. This is not an uncommon situation as the genetically most characterized variant is often an attenuated laboratory strain while the more virulent strains are either not yet sequenced or the sequence is of lower quality. Often microarray chips or mass spectrometry databases are designed using the best available sequence from the research strain, yet then use RNA and protein samples from another similar virulent strain. The question here was what organism strain to map to and represent on our website: the strain the RNA or protein the sample came from, or alternatively, the strain that matched the identifier and sequence used in the research to detect the RNA or protein. For the MPD we chose to map to the sequence identifier reported in the data files and related publications, with the additional virulent strain information noted in the results summary.",

Results that fell below the significance threshold used by the research center were made available via download of data sets at the FTP site. 2) \u201cRAW\u201d unprocessed machine specific data would be stored by the PRC and available on request. 3) To facilitate and simplify searches across laboratories and data types, we omitted most data type or analysis specific numerical values and statistics from the general MPD search and display. These numerical values are usually platform, laboratory and method dependent and cannot easily be used to compare across datasets so including them might be confusing to users. Instead, we focused on providing simple, yet powerful, queries of experimental summaries where a user can query if a gene/protein was presented in the results and, in some cases, if it showed a reported increase or decrease in expression or accumulation based on the PRC's criteria. Once a set of proteins of interest is identified, a user can then drill down to view the specific experimental values and methods employed to generate the particular dataset. Links to details in the publications are provided and full data are available via FTP. Since all protein attributes are included as search options, one can query beyond simply protein names, accessions or project data and search pathways, protein families, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, database cross-references and many other attributes, providing many powerful options to the users.",

Relatively little has yet been done for inter-species pathogen-host networks. Several common factors that have proved useful in other studies are 1) evaluating network hubs with many interactions and 2) using correlations between interacting pairs with similar gene expression patterns. For this small interactome, we looked for relatively abundant proteins associated with multiple interactions. We identified a single human protein interacting with three viral proteins, three being the largest number of viral interactions seen with a single host protein in this data set. The interactions are shown in Figure 5B. The host protein Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 (P19013) interacts with three viral proteins (P11258 - 14 kDa fusion protein, A27L; Q805H7 - Chemokine-binding protein C23/B29; P17362 - Protein C6L). The 14 kDa fusion protein A27L is the most abundant protein seen in this data set and participates in virus penetration at during cell fusion [36], [37]. A27L facilitates initial attachment to cells by binding to glycosaminoglycans [38]. A27L is found in all orthopoxviruses and has no cellular or entomopoxvirus homologs. Additional viral proteins involved in attachment (D8L, H3L) [39], [40] and fusion (F9L, I2L) [41], [42] were not observed. The Chemokine-binding protein C23L belongs to a family of poxvirus chemokine-binding proteins that mimic the chemokine response and prevent activation and chemotaxis of leukocytes [43], [44]. Protein C6L belongs to a family of poxvirus paralogs that may function as toll-like receptor inhibitors based on homology to A52R [45], [46], [47]. Thus, this protein may modulate Toll/IL-1R signaling, resulting in a diminished host immune response and enhancing viral survival.",

This resulted in a list of 21 \u201ccore unique\u201d proteins in the pathogenic strains. It is possible that the proteins found may have homologs in other organisms which were undetected by CUPID because the genes were not annotated as open reading frames To confirm their uniqueness, the 21 proteins were screened for significant regions of similarity at the DNA level (either pseudogenes or unannotated genes) using tBLASTn against the NCBI nr database. Using NCBI's nr which is produced independently of similar, but not identical, sources as iProClass also helps assure no sequences were missing from our warehouse. This additional analysis resulted in a total of 10 Bacillus anthracis specific proteins proposed as high-quality targets for development of diagnostic probes. We then supplemented this information with data from the PRC projects and Master Protein Directory to create a matrix of information (Figure 6). Six of the ten targets have data from the University of Michigan PRC showing that they were differentially expressed in published microarray experiments. Nine of the ten are available as clones produced by the Harvard Institute of Proteomics. A search of all the microarray data from the University of Michigan (using http://proteinbank.vbi.vt.edu/ProteinBank/p/search/searchproteins.dll) showed that the four proteins not differentially expressed (listed as clones only in Figure 6) were still constitutively expressed well above background in all studies (not shown).

            "text": "A systems approach to biology or medicine requires the sharing, integration and navigation of large and diverse experimental data sets to develop the models and hypotheses required to make new discoveries and to develop new treatments. To date this has most often been done with selected research data or within an institution or program where common instrumentation and methods make standardization of experimental practices and data management easier to achieve [57], [58], [59]. Alternative approaches require a reanalysis of all the data by a common methodology as has been done in some data repositories [60], [61] or assigning some common statistical metric to all data of a certain type to allow functional coupling [62]. These approaches are all potentially useful, but practically difficult to achieve on a large scale with heterogeneous data. The protein-centric approach we employed is a relatively simple, yet powerful and practical, approach to integrate and navigate diverse sets of omics data in a manner useful for systems biology. Proteins are often the biologically functional elements in cellular networks; thus, many types of data can be mapped to and through proteins as a common biological object.",

            "text": "The lightweight data warehouse approach used for the MPD proved useful in practice, especially with large datasets as its simple design and schema allows greater flexibility to add new data types and to modify search and analysis capabilities. Similar lightweight approaches and schemas designed to optimize queries have been shown useful in integration of genomic data [63], [64]. The main drawback of this approach is that the warehouse does not contain all the data. However, this is rarely a problem if the data are available in some other data resource optimized for that particular data type and if some upfront analysis of the user's needs for query and analysis options is performed. For example, our use case analysis suggested that for microarray and mass spectrometry data, individual raw intensities, machine-specific parameters and most calculated numerical values were not required for general queries and analysis across the combined data as these values were only comparable between the particular analysis performed in one lab. As a result, most numerical values were not included in the MPD for the default search but are accessible for display via hyperlinks to our Protein Data Center or FTP site. However, if a new attribute appear or users request searches on a particular value omitted from the warehouse, adding it is a relatively simple matter of adding new data columns. For instance, in example II our combination and analysis of mass spectrometry and protein interaction data, we could include peptide counts directly in the MPD for immediate download instead of retrieving them from the ftp files. Of course, no one approach can be perfect, as in biology and research there always seems to be exceptions and new data and multiple approaches need to be accommodated.",

However the current standards do not necessarily guarantee integration as the problems of reconciling gene and protein identifiers as well as differences in experimental methodology remain. We investigated and employed a few common data standards and ontologies in developing the Biodefense Proteomics Resource. We provided some data using mzData [65] and MAGE-ML [66] but also provided original data-specific text files for download. We found that several ontologies to describe experimental methods were useful but incomplete and focused on higher eukaryotes and thus did not yet contain terms needed for microbial pathogens. Most useful was the Gene Ontology [67] which has been widely adopted to annotate and classify large scale results and can be used for searching and classification in the MPD.",

We continue to focus on data integration to allow biologists to find relevant data sets for further detailed analysis using the approaches and tools of their choice. In general the analysis of diverse omics data is an area of active research and a number of useful tools are under active development including cytoscape [28], bioconductor [68] and galaxy [69].
