The virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae; about 35,000-50,000 cases of and 10,000 deaths from JEV infection are reported annually [1]. JEV was first isolated in Japan in 1935, following which it spread to most other Asian countries. At present, this virus is even found in regions beyond its ecological boundaries. Recently, JEV has spread to regions as far as northern Australia [2,3]. Hence, there is a concern that JEV might become a global threat. In fact, it is not unusual to find 2 or more flaviviruses co-circulating in one area. In Southeast Asia, the most important flaviviruses are JEV and dengue viruses (DENV) [4]. In northern Australia, Kunjin virus is found to co-circulate with JEV [5]. In Vladivostok, Russia, studies have reported the detection of WNV in birds [6]. In addition, there is evidence that WNV infection in India from Japanese encephalitis nonendemic areas and endemic areas [7].",

            "text": "The flaviviruses WNV, DENV, and JEV share some common features, such as transmission via mosquitoes, and cross-react with each other in serological tests. These cross-reactive responses could confound the interpretation during serological testing, including neutralization tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [8]. JEV contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome with a size of 11 kb; the genome encodes 3 structural proteins, namely, core protein (C), premembrane protein (prM/M), and envelope protein (E), and 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). Of the 10 proteins, the E protein is the dominant antigen responsible for eliciting neutralizing antibodies and plays an important role in inducing immunologic responses in the infected host. However, antibodies against the E proteins of the 3 aforementioned flaviviruses could cross-reactive with each other. Previous reports [9,10] show that in western blot (WB) prM protein may be used to serologically differentiate individuals infected with JEV from those infected with DENV, WNV and SLEV. Our preliminary WB results for JEV-positive sera also showed that prM reactivity could be used to differentiate JEV-positive sera from WNV- and DENV-positive sera. Hence, prM and antibodies against prM would be useful for conducting seroepidemiological studies of flavivirus infections in the regions that have prevalence of more than one flavivirus. However, because prM is a membrane protein, it is difficult to express it in Escherichia coli or other expression systems. In this report, we mapped and identified a linear B-cell epitope on the prM/M protein of JEV.",

All the fragments were fused with GST and expressed in the pGEX-6p-1 vector. The recombinant fusion proteins were purified with Glutathione Sepharose 4B RediPack column affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) (Fig. 1B).

In fact, the further survey showed that the substitution at this amino acid residue did not affect the binding ability of MAb 2F7 to the epitope. Sequence alignment was also performed between the epitope and the homologous sequences of other 2 flaviviruses, i.e., WNV and DENV (Fig. 7A).

Serological cross-reactivity was mainly observed because these virus antigens contain the same immunodominant E glycoprotein epitopes responsible for eliciting a large proportion of cross-reactive serum antibodies during viral infection [13]. In this study, we identified a linear epitope from the PrM/M protein; this epitope could react with the JEV-positive swine sera and rabbit sera but not with rabbit anti-DENV and anti-WNV sera. The homogeneity between this linear epitope and all 4 serotype DENV PrM/M protein was less than 40%. Moreover, the same domains of the PrM/M protein from WNV did not react with the swine-anti JEV sera. and MAb 2F7. And only peptide lineage II strain 956 WNV showed weakly reactive with MAb 2F7 and epetide lineage I strain NY99 did not reactive with MAb 2F7. However around the world the predominant WNV were lineage I and lineage II consists exclusively of viruses from southern Africa and Madagascar and rare Europe district [14]. Hence, we confirmed that the epitope M14-13 was virus specific and could be potentially used in serological monitoring and for differential diagnosis of JEV infection.",
