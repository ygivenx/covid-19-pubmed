These zoonotic pathogens fall into a wide spectrum of genera, but due to their high genetic variability and wide circulation, RNA viruses arguably pose the most significant threat to human health. Further, due to the close proximity between animals and humans in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, human populations in these locations are disproportionally at risk of exposure from these viral pathogens (Paterson et al., 2014). Although animal viruses with zoonotic potential have likely been circulating continually, a high number of zoonotic RNA viruses have been discovered in recent years. This phenomenon is not only dependent on more thorough and enhanced detection methods but is also likely associated with the changing behaviour of human populations and the closer proximity between humans and the animals that act as reservoirs for these viruses (Calisher, Childs, Field, Holmes, & Schountz, 2006; Moratelli & Calisher, 2015; Sasaki et al., 2012; Wong, Lau, Woo, & Yuen, 2007).",

Many bat species, including the insectivorous Scotophilus kuhlii present across South and South\u2010East Asia (Bates et al., 2016), live in large groups with a range of social behaviours involving close and prolonged contact with others in the roost; this activity may facilitate the horizontal transmission of viruses between roost members. In addition, some bat species have a long life span (up to 35 years) and are able to travel long distances (e.g., Eidolon helvum can migrate >4,500 km), thus increasing the likelihood of exposure to infectious agents (Drexler, Corman, & Drosten, 2014; Escaffre, Borisevich, & Rockx, 2013; Plowright et al., 2015). The modification and destruction of natural habitats increase the likelihood of contact between bats and humans, thus providing new opportunities for interspecies viral exchange.",

Notoriously, Nipah and Menangle viruses, both paramyxoviruses, have caused outbreaks in humans, horses and pigs in Australia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and India (Escaffre et al., 2013; Kulkarni, Tosh, Venkatesh, & Senthil, 2013). Furthermore, SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) has been identified in Chinese bats, and it has been shown that the SARS\u2010CoV genome sequence generated from humans and civets during the 2002\u20132003 outbreak in China phylogenetically clustered within the bat associated group of SARS\u2010CoV\u2010like viruses (Calisher et al., 2006; Drexler et al., 2014; Moratelli & Calisher, 2015; Wong et al., 2007). Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, also pose a significant threat to human health, and despite human outbreaks being rare and sporadic, they are associated with a high case fatality rate (Hoffmann et al., 2013; Jayme et al., 2015; Kgaladi et al., 2013; Plowright et al., 2015).",

Further, in parts of the country, rats are commonly trapped in the rice fields and sold live for consumption; 3,300\u20133,600 tonnes are sold nationally annually (Van Cuong et al., 2015). Rats and other rodents are also recognized as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses that can be transmitted via close contact with saliva, urine or faeces; the circulation of hantavirus has been reported in rats in Viet Nam (Van Cuong et al., 2015). As South\u2010East Asia is a hot spot for zoonotic viruses, the WT\u2010VIZIONS (Wellcome Trust\u2010Vietnamese Initiative on Zoonotic Infections) project (Rabaa et al., 2015) is aiming to generate data on the circulation of viral zoonotic pathogens that pose a risk to human health. With bats suspected to be the main reservoir for more than 200 viral species, 248 bat samples from three different guano farms in the south of Viet Nam (Dong Thap Province) were screened for paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses to assess the potential risk to human health. In addition, 270 rodent faecal samples from the same province were screened for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.",

The three sampling locations were visited every 12 weeks (one sampling event) on six occasions between 2012 and 2014. The farms were visited in the afternoon; to catch urine and faeces, a ten\u2010square metre section of plastic sheeting was placed under trees in which bats were roosting. The urine and faecal samples were collected from the plastic sheeting using a sterile Pasteur pipette for the urine and a plastic scoop for the faeces. These samples were then placed in a graduated 2\u2010ml tube (Sarstedt microtubes, Denmark) and transferred to the laboratory in Ho Chi Minh City for processing and/or storage at \u221280\u00b0C. At each sampling event, we aimed to collect 10\u201315 samples per farm. Depending on the roosting density and activity of the bats, we estimated the plastic sheeting could hold urine and faeces for up to 200 individual bats.",

For this study, we implemented a sampling and testing protocol that sought to maximize the likelihood of detection if the target viruses were present. Firstly, we collected pooled urine and faecal samples from three different bat guano farms in the south of Viet Nam, rather than catching and sampling individual animals, so each sample potentially represented multiple animals. Bats forage nocturnally and roost communally in trees during the day; during this period, they frequently urinate and defecate, allowing collection on plastic sheeting. This approach has been used successfully (Field et al., 2015) and has been shown to increase the number of animals sampled and therefore increase the chance of detecting viral nucleic acid. A limitation of this investigation is that the pooling of samples from many animals may have overestimated the true prevalence, given the possibility that multiple positive (pooled) samples may reflect a single individual.",

Recently, bats have been shown to harbour a great diversity of previously unknown paramyxoviruses, some of which have been associated with zoonotic events (Baker et al., 2013). The interrelationship of these paramyxoviruses with bats highlights the complex role that bats play as a reservoir for these viruses. Despite our sampling framework being narrow, it was relatively thorough, as we screened 248 bat faecal samples and 222 bat urine samples. RNA from novel paramyxoviruses was detected by PCR and could be characterized by sequencing in approximately 2% of bat faecal samples and nearly 5% of bat urine samples. Our study and studies by others indicate that it is highly likely that there are more extant bat\u2010derived paramyxoviruses yet to be characterized (Drexler et al., 2009, 2012; Lau et al., 2010). For this reason, it is crucial that the potential consequences and risk of zoonotic spillover of such viruses are investigated further.",

Our findings indicate that the novel paramyxoviruses detected were not present in all bat colonies at the time of sampling, suggesting that the extent of carriage and/or excretion in any particular bat colony is likely to fluctuate over time. These data indicated that while infection in a bat colony is periodic and transient for paramyxoviruses, this may not be the case for coronaviruses. Therefore, from a zoonotic infection risk management perspective, it is prudent to assume that any bat colony could be infected at any time and that those working in proximity to the bat colonies should adopt exposure risk minimization strategies in case these viruses are capable of infecting humans. We additionally found that PCR amplification\u2010positive samples from bats were associated with sample type; urine was more likely to be positive for paramyxoviruses while faecal material was more likely to generate positive amplification of coronaviruses. Importantly, the screening of these samples by PCR alone may underestimate the prevalence of these viruses in the sampled populations, as detection is limited by the specificity of primers and the quality of samples collected using indirect methods such as that used for the collection of bat samples.",

The samples included in the current study were collected only from the insectivorous S. kuhlii, while at least 90 other chiropterans have also been identified in Viet Nam (http://www.iucnredlist.org/). Our sampling was further limited by the use of faecal and urine samples, which are unlikely to be optimum materials in which to detect filoviruses.

This observation is supported by a previous study, where a novel rat paramyxovirus was detected only in the kidney and spleen of rats (Woo et al., 2012). Novel coronavirus RNA was detected by PCR amplification and characterized by sequencing in 4.4% of the rat faeces. The obtained rat coronavirus sequences were closely related to rat and murine betacoronavirus sequences from southern China that were found to be capable of infecting up to ten different rat species, including R. losea and R. tanezumi (Wang et al., 2015). In our study, novel rat coronavirus strains were detected in a single rat species (R. argentiventer).

Paramyxoviruses in particular are known to cause infections in humans, and the spillover of Hendra virus and Nipah virus from bats to horses or pigs, respectively, and subsequently to humans has been reported in Australia and Malaysia (Edson et al., 2015; Goldspink et al., 2015; Sherrini & Chong, 2014). Laboratory investigations are being conducted to assess whether the coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses detected here are viable in cell culture in order to better predict whether these viruses have the potential to cause spillover infections in the human population and to improve genomic characterization of these viruses to allow for greater phylogenetic inference. Furthermore, our countrywide project is aiming to recruit hospitalized patients with common and uncommon disease phenotypes in order to determine whether such viruses cause previously undiagnosed infections in humans in Viet Nam (Rabaa et al., 2015).",
