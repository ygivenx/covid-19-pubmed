            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of about 27\u201332 kb [1]. They are round and sometimes pleiomorphic virions of approximately 80-120 nm in diameter. Their genome is the largest of all RNA viruses [2, 3]. Coronaviruses share features of genome organization and replication strategy, but have different virion morphology and genome lengths. The 20 kb polymerase (pol) gene, which covers the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the coronavirus genome, contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF 1a and ORF 1b [1]. ORF 1b hosts the most highly conserved genomic sequences, encoding conserved functions such as polymerase and helicase activity [4]. These functions combined with similarities in replication and expression strategies, exhibit an evolutionary link among coronaviruses, arteriviruses, and toroviruses, thus forming the rationale for placing these viruses in the order Nidovirales [1]. Therefore, the highly conserved structure and function of viral polymerases make the pol a logical region for making phylogenetic comparisons.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses cause various diseases in different hosts, such as respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and encephalomyelitis in birds and mammals [5]. Coronaviruses are classified into four distinct phylogenetic groups. Whereas alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses infect mammals, deltacoronaviruses infect avian species [6]. All known human coronaviruses (HCoV) belong to the alphacoronavirus and betacoronaviruses. HCoV cause 30 % of common colds as well as severe infections in infants, children, and immunocompromised persons and the elderly [7]. HCoVs have a worldwide circulation, with reports published in populations of different countries such as Saudi Arabia [8], France [9], Kenya [10] and China [11] among others. However in 2012, a novel betacoronavirus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was isolated in Jeddah from a patient who was suffering from pneumonia and later died [8]. This MERS-CoV continues to cause fatal severe lower respiratory tract illnesses in various parts of the world, especially in the Middle East. As of February 2015, the World Health Organization had reported 971 laboratory confirmed cases with 356 deaths [12]. In light of the finding of this previously unknown coronavirus, it is probable that coronaviruses, other than those recognized to date, may be circulating in human populations in Kenya. As human coronaviruses are not routinely analyzed in Kenya, this study sought to identify and characterize HCoV strains circulating in different parts of Kenya and thus provide a knowledge base for epidemiological importance of human coronaviruses.",

Clinical parameters and symptoms including recent history of ILI, cough, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, chills, nasal stuffiness, runny nose, sputum production, headache, joint pain, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding were documented. Only those samples collected from January 2009 to December 2012 for which specific consent was granted for future use were analyzed.

Control RNAs used were obtained from ATCC (VR-1558D for OC43 and VR740D for 229E) as well as NL63 RNA from the KEMRI-Welcome Trust research program. The MERS-CoV control RNA came along with the test kit from CDC.

HCoV-OC43 was the most commonly observed HCoV and this agrees with many previous studies that have reported HCoV-OC43 predominance [27]. HCoV-NL63 contributed to 2 % of ILI cases in our study period. This finding echoes the findings in South Africa by Smuts, [28] where they showed that HCoV-NL63, contributed to 2.4 % of ILI cases in the period of one and a half years. HCoV-229E contributed to 1 % of ILI cases in the study period, echoing results from other studies worldwide that show low detection of this HCoV [27]. This is comparable to what has been observed globally, where HCoV activity is sporadic throughout the year with no obvious distinct seasonality [29]. Overall, the symptoms associated with coronavirus infection were similar to what has been reported elsewhere [1, 7, 24] and it was difficult to distinguish an infection involving HCoV using symptoms alone. This justifies the WHO classification of respiratory viral infections into influenza-like-illnesses without clear distinction of a specific respiratory virus infection based on symptoms alone.",
