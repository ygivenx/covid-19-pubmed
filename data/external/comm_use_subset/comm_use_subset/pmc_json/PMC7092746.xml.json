IBV is extremely important because it causes major losses in the poultry industry. The authors first outline the natural course of coronavirus disease in poultry and then discuss the devastating potential for these viruses to infect other domestic and wild avian species. The authors also provide reasons for the lack of efficacy of current vaccines: multitudinous serotype variation without cross-protection and no induction of long-term immunity. The authors report that small differences (<5%) in amino acid sequences in the major immunologically recognized epitopes can lead to lack of cross-protection between serotypes. The authors also review the nature of the protective immune response that a vaccine should elicit and compare the efficacy of attenuated and killed vaccines in eliciting such responses. They review the process of virus attenuation and report on two, yet to be licensed, experimental vaccine approaches for coronaviruses: subviral vaccines and adenovirus-vectored vaccines. In ovo vaccination is also discussed as a future method of immunizing poultry.",

They begin with a general, detailed review of the classical IFN-induction pathways. They then discuss how SARS-CoV initiates infection despite the activation of IFN-induction pathways, using some of their data to show that SARS-CoV counteracts IRF-3 by sending it back to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, where it acts to inactivate the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. The authors also discuss the role of IL-8 in reducing IFN responses, which is produced in significant amounts during a SARS infection. The authors also speculate on how SARS-CoV infection induces the so-called \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 associated with SARS infections. It would have been appropriate if the authors had included in their review a discussion of the deregulation of the cytokine response in the lungs, where much of the SARS infection occurs and its relationship to the systemic cytokine response as detected in serum.",

To enable the reader to quickly review all of the vaccines and vaccine trials published to date, the authors insert a comprehensive table of SARS-CoV vaccines tested as of early 2007 and the results of any challenge studies done with the vaccines listed. They also discuss the future development of live-attenuated vaccines and replicon particle vaccines. They summarize the challenges of developing a successful, protective coronavirus vaccine, especially for SARS-CoV. They suggest that such a vaccine must elicit broad-spectrum cross-reactivity to all the potential quasi-species that will probably arise and that coronavirus vaccines must not trigger an immune enhancement of the challenge virus.

There is also an entire section on virus attachment and entry into the host cell. The epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 is reviewed, and the authors discuss the concept of HCoV-NL63 as a coinfecting agent in many respiratory diseases. They postulate the significance of coinfection with HCoV-NL63, especially in relation to the finding that coinfection with HCoV-NL63 often results in more hospitalization of patients than do respiratory infections caused by a single agent. A paragraph is devoted to the putative association of HCoV-NL63 with Kawasaki disease or lack thereof.

They provide the reader with a simple yet effective cartoon of the virus replication cycle to illustrate sections of the virus replication cycle that could be targeted by antiviral chemotherapies. Also included in this chapter is a comprehensive list of compounds and other materials that have been reported to show efficacy against SARS-CoV in vitro. This leads to the discussion of some of the pitfalls of this chapter. In many cases compounds found in the table have been demonstrated to have in vitro efficacy by some laboratories and not to have in vitro efficacy in other laboratories. The authors should have discussed the problem of laboratory-to-laboratory variability in determining efficacy of compounds against SARS-CoV. The authors, when reporting on compound efficacy against SARS-CoV, many times forget to report on the selectivity of the compound. Even though some of the compounds described are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV, they are toxic enough not to be selective inhibitors. Selectivity should have been emphasized in a more critical review of the compounds listed in their table, because compounds with selectivity indices of less than 20 often do not show activity in animal models. A number of the compounds mentioned in the table fall into this category. The reader is also not told whether or not the activity is virucidal; however, that is often the fault of the group publishing the data. Virucides are much less likely to be efficacious in treating lung infections owing to the toxicity often associated with them, lack of oral bioavailability, and the lack of efficacy against cell-to-cell transmission of virus. The authors fail to mention the few studies that have been published on the activity of several of these compounds in a mouse lung replication model. A number of the active and inactive compounds mentioned in the table do not prevent virus replication in the lungs of mice. For example, ribavirin has been found not only to have poor selectivity in vitro, but actually to prolong and enhance viral replication in a mouse lung replication model; a finding that has since been verified in a newly established mouse adapted SARS-CoV lethal murine model. Overall, the authors should be more critical in their review of the antiviral agents that have purported activity against SARS-CoV in vitro.",

Many of the compounds have been found active only in one laboratory but not in another and many have very poor selectivity, but this is not emphasized. Another small problem that the editor could have resolved is the standardization of the acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-like virus.
