            "text": "The lipid phosphatase Sac1 is an evolutionary conserved regulator of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) and plays vital roles at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/plasma membrane contact sites and in Golgi organization and trafficking [1]-[3]. Sac1 is an integral membrane protein containing a large N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and two transmembrane regions near its C terminus [4]. The crystal structure of the N-terminal catalytic domain of yeast Sac1p was resolved [5], but the arrangement of the two transmembrane regions and their role in Sac1p localization has not been determined. In mammals, Sac1 cycles continuously between ER and Golgi compartments via the canonical trafficking mechanisms involving coat protein complex-I (COP-I) and coat protein complex-II (COP-II) [6]. In proliferating cells, Sac1 localizes to both ER and cisternal Golgi regions but is absent from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) [7]. The polarized distribution of Sac1 is critical for maintaining a steep PtdIns(4)P gradient at the Golgi complex with the majority of PtdIns(4)P confined to the TGN [7]. During starvation and in quiescent cells Sac1 accumulates at the TGN, which reduces Golgi PtdIns(4)P levels and slows anterograde trafficking [1]. All mammalian Sac1 orthologs contain two distinct sequence motifs that are required for shuttling between ER and Golgi. A dilysine motif at the C terminus of Sac1 is essential for interaction with the COP-I machinery and for retrieval to the ER [1], [8]. A leucine repeat region at the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain promotes oligomerization of Sac1 during starvation, which is a prerequisite for Golgi accumulation [1]. However, how the distribution of Sac1 within the Golgi is controlled remains unclear.",

Passage through the Golgi is also required for post-translational processing of secretory proteins [9]. The mechanisms responsible for the characteristic intra-Golgi distribution of resident enzymes that are required for glycosylation and other modifications are not well established. Unlike the classic retrieval motifs that control steady state localization of ER proteins, no common Golgi sorting sequence has been found [9], [10]. Two mechanisms have been proposed for Golgi retention, commonly referred to as the oligomerization and the bilayer-thickness model [9], [11]. The former proposes that retention of Golgi enzymes is achieved by forming large oligomers, which prevent sorting into anterograde transport vesicles [12], [13]. The latter postulates that retention relies on the length of membrane-spanning domains and the membrane bilayer thickness of the individual Golgi sections [12].",

We found that a minimal construct containing only the first of the two transmembrane segments of SAC1 (TM1) is efficiently concentrated at the Golgi. In addition, the large N-terminal cytosolic region of SAC1 was independently sufficient for Golgi localization. These results suggest that Golgi distribution of SAC1 is controlled via both membrane domain-dependent partitioning and protein-protein interactions.",

            "text": "The human phosphoinositide phosphatase SAC1 is an integral membrane protein with two transmembrane domains near the C-terminus (Figure 1A) [4], [14]. Consistent with our previous studies [1], transiently expressed GFP-SAC1 is mainly localized at the ER but also shows colocalization with the Golgi marker GM130 (Figure 1B). In contrast, GFP-SAC1-K2A, in which the two lysines in the C-terminal retrieval motif were replaced by alanines, predominately accumulates at the Golgi apparatus [1], (Figure 1C). To map the regions in SAC1 that are required for Golgi targeting, a series of GFP and flag-tagged truncation mutants was constructed (Figure 1A). The intracellular localization of these SAC1 mutants was analyzed by confocal microscopy and compared with either endogenous GM130 or endogenous GRASP65 as Golgi markers. To examine if the large cytoplasmic N-terminal domain contains a Golgi retention signal, GFP-SAC1(1\u2013518) was constructed, in which the entire cytoplasmic N-terminal domain was fused to GFP. GFP-SAC1(1\u2013518) displayed cytoplasmic distribution but also showed some localization at the Golgi (Figure 1D), suggesting that the N-terminal domain itself may have a low affinity for the Golgi. However, this domain was not required for efficient Golgi retention because the mutant GFP-SAC1(478\u2013587)-K2A, in which most of the cytosolic N-terminal domain was deleted, colocalized with the Golgi marker GM130 (Figure 1E). Furthermore, the truncation mutant flag-SAC1(1\u2013549), which contains the entire cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, the transmembrane domain TM1, and six amino acids predicted to face the lumen, also showed Golgi localization (Figure 1F). These results suggested that the region from amino acid 478 to 549, which contains TM1 and short flanking sequences, was sufficient for Golgi retention. To test this idea, the GFP-tagged construct GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549), containing only this region, was generated. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549) displayed accumulation at the Golgi (Figure 1G). Whereas wild-type SAC1 shows a characteristic distribution at both ER and Golgi regions [1], a large proportion of cells expressing GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549) showed the GFP signal confined to the Golgi (83% \u00b13%; mean \u00b1 SD from two experiments, 50 cells each). Together these data indicate that the short GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549) construct contains all the elements that are needed for efficient Golgi retention.",

GFP-SAC1(478\u2013543) showed the same strong co-localization with Golgi marker GM130 as GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549) (Figure 2A,B), suggesting that this short stretch in the SAC1 sequence is not required for Golgi retention. To examine whether the adjoining N-terminal cytoplasmic region adjacent to TM1 is required for Golgi retention, pGFP-SAC1(501\u2013549) and pGFP-SAC1(512\u2013549) were constructed. Fluorescence microscopy showed that GFP-SAC1(501\u2013549) localized at both the Golgi and the ER (Figure 2C). In contrast, GFP-SAC1(512\u2013549) was largely restricted to the ER compartment, where it colocalized with Sec61\u03b2 (Figure 2D). This result suggested that elimination of cytoplasmic region that flanks TM1 causes retention at the ER. This region contains the sequence 505-DELE-508, which resembles the classical COP-II binding motif DXE [15]. However, a GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549)-E2A mutant showed no ER retention (Figure S1) and it remains unclear whether and how this portion of the protein is required for SAC1 trafficking.",

At steady state, wild-type TfR2 localizes mainly to the plasma membrane and intracellular endosomes [16], [17].

The corresponding chimera GFP-TfR2(73\u2013801)TM1 was also constructed (Figure 3A). GFP-TfR2(73\u2013801) showed plasma membrane localization in transfected cells and colocalized with fluorescently labeled weat germ agglutinin (WGA647) when analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3B). In contrast, GFP-TfR2(73\u2013801)TM1 was retained predominantly at the Golgi and no cell surface staining was detectable (Figure 3C). Furthermore, replacing TM1 in GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549) with the transmembrane domain of TfR2 impaired Golgi retention (Figure S2).

            "text": "Mammalian Sac1 orthologs have several unique properties related to their tightly controlled intracellular localization. In proliferating cells, Sac1 displays a specific distribution between the ER and the cis-Golgi, which is essential for spatial control of PtdIns(4)P [7]. Serum starvation induces quantitative accumulation of Sac1 at the Golgi but this translocation is promptly reversed upon growth factor stimulation [1]. Previous studies have shown that a canonical C-terminal dilysine motif, present in all mammalian Sac1 orthologues, is required for steady state distribution at the ER [1], [8]. In this report, we show that one of the two transmembrane domains in human SAC1 is sufficient for partitioning into the Golgi. The relevance of a transmembrane segment for Golgi localization is not unprecedented. For example, the first of three membrane-spanning domains of E1 glycoprotein of avian coronavirus was found to be sufficient to retain this protein in the cis-Golgi [24]. Furthermore, the single transmembrane domains in many Golgi glycosylation enzymes are key determinants of their specific localization at the Golgi [8]. How transmembrane domains mediate Golgi retention is not entirely clear and two mechanisms have been proposed, which are based either on oligomerization of Golgi enzymes into large complexes or on membrane thickness. SAC1 can form oligomers and oligomerization promoted by starvation coincides with Golgi accumulation [1]. However, the data presented here show that a minimal construct encompassing only transmembrane region TM1 plus short flanking regions efficiently accumulates at the Golgi. Furthermore, transplanting the TM1 sequence without its flanking regions into TfR2 was sufficient to redirect this protein to the Golgi. Our experiments also show that lengthening of TM1 significantly reduced Golgi retention and induced plasma membrane localization. Based on these results we propose that bilayer thickness may contribute to the precise distribution of Sac1 within the Golgi.",

            "text": "Based on the bilayer thickness model, relatively short transmembrane domains are thought to correlate with Golgi retention [25], [26]. A recent bioinformatic investigation used comprehensive comparisons of transmembrane domains of integral membrane proteins to show that the transmembrane length of resident membrane proteins varies along the secretory pathway [27]. The mean hydrophobic length of transmembrane domains in vertebrate ER and Golgi proteins is 20.6 residues, whereas TGN membrane proteins have a mean value of 24.8 hydrophobic residues [27]. The predicted length of TM1 is 23 amino acids, which is longer than the common transmembrane spanning domains of Golgi enzymes [27]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the specific dimensions of TM1 allow SAC1 to reach the TGN, which may be physiologically important because the phosphatase is responsible for downregulation of TGN PtdIns(4)P levels during starvation.",

The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of SAC1 may play multiple roles in this process. Oligomerization of this domain is a key determinant in controlling ER exit or interaction with COP-I because oligomerization-deficient SAC1 mutants remain concentrated at the ER during starvation [1]. The presented data suggest that the N-terminal region of SAC1 plays an additional role in the targeting of SAC1 to the Golgi. In yeast, the N-terminal domain of Sac1p interacts with the peripheral Golgi protein Vps74, a PtdIns(4)P effector required for Golgi localization of glycosyltransfreases [28]. Whether GOLPH3, the human homolog of Vps74 [29], interacts with SAC1 has not been examined. However, deletion of Vps74 in yeast does not abrogate Golgi localization of Sac1p and there is evidence that additional integral Golgi membrane proteins are involved in Sac1p localization [30].",

            "text": "In summary, we have identified two specific regions in human SAC1 that are independently involved in Golgi targeting. Combined with our previous studies, these results support a multi-step mechanism controlling distribution of SAC1 at the Golgi. During proliferation, SAC1 partitions into the cisternal Golgi but is continuously retrieved to the ER by interacting with retrograde COP-I complexes [1], [7]. The first transmembrane segment TM1 is sufficient to bring about Golgi localization but only if the COP-I sorting motif is absent. Because Golgi partitioning via transmembrane domains is a passive process an additional retention mechanism must be in place to establish the steady state distribution of SAC1 at the cisternal Golgi in proliferating cells. Our data show that the N-terminal domain of SAC1 plays an important role in this process. This view is supported by our previous work showing that elimination of the N-terminal domain of SAC1 triggers ER accumulation if the C-terminal COP-I binding motif is intact [1]. When ER retrieval is turned off during starvation, SAC1 behaves like a resident Golgi enzyme and TM1 may then direct the protein to Golgi regions with appropriate membrane thickness resulting in the turnover of PtdIns(4)P at these sites.",
