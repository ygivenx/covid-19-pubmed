Since it was emerged in the United States in 1987 and in Europe in 1990, PRRSV has rapidly spread in the swine producing regions and became one of the most important devastating diseases of swine worldwide. It can cause severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in young growing pigs [2]. Infection with PRRSV also made pigs easy to secondary infection by other pathogens [3]. Up to date, since there is no efficient method or drugs against PRRSV, it is very important and urgent to develop the effective therapeutic strategies to control PRRS.",

ORF1a and ORF1b could produce 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2 etc.) [4\u20137]. Previous studies have shown that the nsp11 of equine arteritis virus(EAV), which is another member of family Arteriviridae, may play a key role in viral RNA synthesis and additional functions in the viral life cycle [8]. Other and our previous work also demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 inhibited the host innate immune responses such as the transcription of type I interferon [7], the RNAi innate immune response [9] and the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated production of IL-1\u03b2 [10], which indicated that PRRSV nsp11 may play an important role in PRRSV infection. So the purpose of present study is to explore the effect of over-expression of nsp11 on PRRSV infection and whether the siRNAs targeting the PRRSV nsp11 could influence PRRSV infection.",

Inhibition of specific genes by siRNA has proven to be a potential therapeutic strategy against viral infection [18], especially for the positive single stranded RNA viruses since their genomes function as both the mRNA and the replication template [19, 20]. Up to date, RNAi has been used against several viruses such as hepatitis B virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, dengue virus and so on [20\u201322]. In this work, we also explore whether the siRNA, which targeted the nucleic acid sequence of nsp11, influenced the titers of PRRSV, and the results showed that siRNA targeting nsp11 significantly reduced the titers of PRRSV (Fig. 3). A recent improved live PRRSV vaccine has indicated that the ORF1a and ORF1b were the virulence determinants of PRRSV [23]. In addition, our recent work also show that RNAi innate immune response was an antiviral response to PRRSV and PRRSV inhibited this response by PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp11, which indicated that targeting nsp11 would be useful for RNAi innate immunity against PRRSV [9]. So it is reasonable to propose that our present results gave a new clue for generating the new PRRSV vaccine by targeting PRRSV nsp11.",
