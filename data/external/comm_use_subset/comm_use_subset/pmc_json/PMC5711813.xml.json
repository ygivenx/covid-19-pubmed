In China, a series of recombinant commercial vaccines, Re1, Re3\u2013Re8, Re10, D7, and D8, have been developed and updated since 2004 to ensure an antigenic match between the vaccines and the circulating strains (8). However, H5 subtype HPAI viruses are still the pathogen with leading potential threat for poultry industry in China. It has been an everlasting difficult situation that the existing vaccine does not provide optimal protection against the emergence of new variants. The rapid mutation of the H5 viruses continues to bypass the time-consuming procedures of screening vaccine candidates during development of traditional inactivated whole-virus vaccine. Besides, propagation of influenza virus in the embryonated chicken eggs during preparation of inactivated virus vaccine produces biohazardous waste materials and leads potential threat to animal and human public health.",

Previous studies reported that the consensus HA-based influenza vaccine candidates have elicited cross-reactive immune responses (9\u201312). There are commercial trivalent HA protein vaccines consisting of three insect-cell-derived full-length HAs similar to the seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccine, which represents an alternative to chicken-egg derived vaccines. In this study, we developed an insect-cell-derived consensus H5 subtype HA gene based virus-like particles (rHA VLPs) vaccine. Single dose immunization of chickens with rHA VLPs vaccines elicited serum and mucosal antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses at high levels, and induced cross-protection against subclade 2.3.4.6 and clade 7 of H5 HPAI viruses.",

Thus, the frequency of mutations at the nucleotide level is higher than that of the amino acid changes. Other researchers have also reported the consensus sequence derived from the nucleotide level (15). The complete open reading frame (ORF) of consensus HA was derived from the consensus nucleotide sequences of the H5 subtype HA after mega-aligning available complete H5 subtype HA sequences which isolated from 2004 to 2012 in China and originated from avian species in GenBank with Clustal V program (Lasergene, v.11; DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA). A total number of 304 HA sequences were analyzed in this study and the highest frequency of nucleotides in each position was selected to generate the consensus HA. The additional leucine zipper GCN-pII sequence was fused to the C-terminal end of the selected HA gene to form trimers as described (16). This engineered recombinant HA was named as rHA. In the results of the complete HA ORF consensus sequence after mega-aligning, the most adaption region is the HA1 head domain (61\u2013161 aa), compared to the relatively conserved HA2 domain during evolution. The codon of the rHA ORF was optimized according to the codon usage frequency of S. frugiperda cell by Gene Script Co. Ltd (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).",

This range of titers is a prerequisite for the monovalent Re6 vaccine preparations with mineral oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant in the manufacture company. The preparation of rHA-CVCVA5 was followed as described in our previous reports (18\u201320). Briefly, the components of CVCVA5 are composed of an aqueous phase that contains L\u2013D isoform muramyl dipeptide (MDP) (InvivoGen), poly I:C (InvivoGen), levamisole hydrochloride (Sigma) added to rHA antigen solution as well as an oil phase of resiquimod (InvivoGen) and imiquimod (InvivoGen) added to Marcol 52 mineral oil (ESSO). One volume aqueous phase was mixed with three volumes of an oil phase. The rHA vaccine preparation in water-in oil emulsion did not contain the adjuvant ingredients of CVCVA5. Preparation of the emulsion form of CVCVA5 was similar to that of the rHA-CVCVA5, having PBS substituted with the rHA antigen solutions and 10-fold concentration of the ingredients of the CVCVA5 as those in the rHA-CVCVA5.

The reciprocal hemagglutinin titers of the rHA rBV-infected Sf9 cell culture supernatants reached to 64 before treating with ultrasonic, and increased to 2,048 after ultrasonic treatment.

We have compared the consensus HA sequence from the amino acid residues with that from the nucleotide level, and there were slightly differences mainly located at 310\u2013340 amino acid residues (data not shown). It is expected that consensus sequences at nucleotide levels would be stable in mRNA translation. Besides, we have developed a wild-type Re6 HA-based vaccine which was poorly immunogenic and conferred partial protection against challenge with ZJ and DT viruses (data not published). In contrast to the single virus strain sequence-based subunit vaccine providing strain-restricted immunity, the consensus-based vaccines have been previously investigated as a strategy for eliciting broadly reactive immune responses for different pathogens, including chikungunya virus (25), hepatitis B virus (26), hepatitis C virus (27), Middle East respiratory virus (28), HIV-1 (29), and influenza (10, 30, 31).",

However, higher levels of HI titers after Re6 vaccination were observed when using Re6 as a test antigen in both the SPF and commercial chickens because of an Re6 antigen exactly matching with the Re6 vaccine.
