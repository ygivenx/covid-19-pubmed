Recent reviews have discussed the various approaches to resolving this question, and identified various factors that may be involved, including: properties of the virus itself (mutation rates and immune escape), properties of the host (seasonal variation in host health and behavior, e.g. crowding and air travel, production and dissemination of bioaerosols through sneezing and coughing), and properties of the environment (temperature, humidity and weather variations, e.g. El Nino) [3]\u2013[7].",

It lies geographically in the Northern hemisphere, and its influenza season occurs during February\u2013April, sometimes with a second peak during June\u2013August, each year. In contrast, other Northern hemisphere countries usually have a more extended influenza season from November to March/April, whereas the influenza season of Southern hemisphere countries usually occur from May to September [7], [28]. Hence, Hong Kong may be unique in that its biphasic influenza seasonality seems to straddle those of the Northern and Southern hemisphere countries, making the molecular epidemiology of its circulating influenza viruses of great interest. In addition, Hong Kong and Southern China have been referred to as the \u2018epicenter\u2019 for new influenza A viruses with pandemic potential for over 25 years now [29]. For all of these reasons, any investigation of the underlying basis for influenza seasonality may benefit greatly from a study of influenza viruses isolated from Hong Kong.",

As these authors stated, ideally, whole genomes should be used for more accurate phylogenetic analyses of influenza virus as has been reported previously [14], [15], with at least one good reason for this being the potentially misleading conclusions caused by influenza viral HA and NA gene reassortments [19].

However, there was a rationale for deliberately selecting children's samples for this study. The reason for this is that, especially in Hong Kong, unlike adults, children of school age (1\u201310 years old) are more likely to stay close to home and not travel far from home, which would minimize any importation of influenza viruses from overseas.

However, the fact that we can find at least one example supporting the latency hypothesis, in these 281 HA and NA sequences spanning 10 years (1997\u20132006), suggests that they may both play a part in the underlying mechanism governing influenza A(H3N2) seasonality.",

Such a reduction in protective efficacy from the contemporary WHO influenza vaccine has indeed been suggested in several reports [14], [30], [31]. Similarly, although, the NA antigen is not usually specified in seasonal influenza vaccine, and its protective effect is unknown, its sequence variation in NA during this transitional period, may have also contributed to the reduced protection provided by the seasonal influenza A(H3N2) vaccine component during this period, when the Fuj/411/02-like viruses were emerging.",

However, there may be small localities of so-called \u2018latency\u2019 where viruses remain circulating at low levels within that local population, to re-emerge during the influenza season of the following year, with relatively little genetic change. This may affect only a minority of these populations, with the majority being infected by newly imported influenza viruses from elsewhere. These concepts are summarized in Figure 1.",

However, they did not have access to large numbers of influenza sequences from Southeast Asia. Thus, in view of the new data presented in this study, it is hoped that such hypotheses may be revised, to include a contribution from the latency mechanism. In some populations (perhaps those more localized in Southeast Asia), this latency mechanism may contribute more significantly to the underlying basis for the seasonality of influenza A \u2013 a possibility not entirely ruled out by one of these studies [38]. More data is required to explore this hypothesis in those populations. Admittedly, the fact that in this 10-year (1997\u20132006) data set of almost 300 influenza A(H3N2) HA and NA sequences from Hong Kong, we have only found one particular example supporting the latency mechanism, does suggest that this is a relative rarity, and that the migration mechanism is probably responsible for the majority of influenza seasonality patterns seen worldwide.",
