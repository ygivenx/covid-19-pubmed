Numerous researchers have investigated the predictors of higher than normal cesarean section rates [9\u201315]. Principal among these include including physician-related factors, insurance-related factors, hospital and health-system factors, and maternal preferences. Additionally, cesarean section rates have also been found to vary by male versus female provider [15], public versus private hospital setting [16\u201319], adoption and use of clinical guidelines [20], public versus private insurance status [18], and even day of the week and time of day [17, 19, 21] that women present for delivery.

Dispositional optimism is seen as a relatively stable personality characteristic (a \u201ctrait\u201d rather than a \u201cstate\u201d) that is associated with general assumptions about positive future outcomes. Dispositional pessimism is the converse: it is a tendency to expect the worst when looking toward future outcomes. A meta-analytic review of the optimism literature from 2009 [25] that examined 83 separate studies found a persistent relationship between optimism and positive health outcomes [25]. In addition, women with higher levels of optimism during pregnancy have been found to have to lower levels of stress, anxiety, and peripartum depression than women with lower levels of optimism [26\u201329]. Optimism has also been linked to birth outcomes, with one study finding that optimistic women gave birth to larger babies [30], and a second study finding that when gestational age was controlled for, women who were least optimistic during pregnancy when compared to women with higher levels of optimism delivered smaller infants [31].

However, pessimism has been shown to have prophylactic effects in certain circumstances. In particular, pessimism can insulate people from the psychological consequences of failure, including anxiety, depression, and diminished self-esteem [32]. Norem and Cantor [32, 33] found that individuals who expect the worst can sometimes use those expectations to help them better meet the demands of stressful challenges. These \u201cdefensive pessimists\u201d engage in active and constructive coping efforts\u2014which may mediate the relationship between pessimism and outcomes [34].

The LOT-R has been widely validated [38] and used in China [39\u201346]. It includes 6 scored items and 4 fillers that generate an overall score, as well as two possible subscales: an optimism subscale and a pessimism subscale. The items that make up the optimism subscale are (1) in uncertain times, I usually expect the best; (2) I'm always optimistic about my future and (3) overall, I expect more good things to happen to me than bad. The items that make up the pessimism subscale are (1) if something can go wrong for me, it will; (2) I hardly ever expect things to go the way I would like them to go; (3) I rarely count on good things happening to me. The participant answers each item based on a 5-point scale, with response options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The pessimism items are reverse scored and then added to the optimism items to create the overall score whereas the subscales are created by summing the items for pessimism and the items for optimism separately. For these analyses, the optimism and pessimism subscales were used separately.",

We were able to elicit birth complications from the medical record, but this study relies upon self-reported complications during the gestation period. We do not believe this to be a significant limitation, however, given the high probability that women will know whether they are experiencing nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, or whether they have vaginal bleeding or swollen hands and feet. We also expect that women will remember if a doctor has told them they have high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, or other more serious pregnancy complications.",

First, it confirms what many women and practitioners may have believed anecdotally: that a woman's mindset during her pregnancy may have an impact on her delivery.

Second, it raises important questions about whether inexpensive cognitive behavioral therapy or other mindset-altering interventions among pregnant women could be used to reduce unplanned cesarean section rates.",
