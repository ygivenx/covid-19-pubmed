Methods of the parent study have been previously published [15]. In brief, illness episodes were identified through longitudinal household-based active weekly surveillance of women from the second trimester of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Mid-nasal swabs were collected from women meeting criteria for respiratory illness episode, which was defined as subjective fever plus 1 or more symptom (cough, sore throat, runny nose, or myalgia). Fever was included in the illness episode definition as part of the primary trial of maternal influenza immunization to capture influenza-like-illness during pregnancy [3]. Febrile HRV respiratory illness was defined as a respiratory illness episode with a nasal swab with HRV detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A unique illness episode was defined as an illness episode followed by 7 symptom-free days. Only the primary HRV illness episode was included in the analysis.",

Gestational age was calculated based on last menstrual period according to a house-to-house census conducted every 5 weeks of all women of childbearing age [16]. If a woman had a missed period, then a urine pregnancy test was performed and she was enrolled in the study if her urine pregnancy test was positive. Therefore, the last menstrual period was used to date the infant\u2019s gestational age in the study with a 5-week recall period. The frequencies of each adverse outcome were compared between infants born to mothers with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy and those without febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy. Infant weights were included if they were obtained at less than 72 hours after birth. Small-for-gestational age was calculated based on the INTERGROWTH-21st criteria [17]. A composite adverse birth outcome was defined as an infant being preterm, LBW, and/or SGA.",

Real-time PCR for additional respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, influenza, coronavirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus, was performed using previously published methods [18\u201322]. Although the HRV RT-PCR assay has been shown to detect some enterovirus from culture lysates in which enterovirus was present in high copy numbers, this assay has not been positive when enterovirus-positive clinical respiratory specimens were tested as part of other studies and therefore less likely in this case to misdiagnose enterovirus as rhinovirus [23, 24]. Rhinovirus-positive samples collected from pregnant and postpartum women with cycle threshold values less than 30 were selected for sequencing using a previously published protocol [23]. For sequencing, previously extracted samples were used to generate complementary deoxyribonucleic acid using random hexamers, and sequencing was performed using primers targeting the 5\u2019 noncoding region. Gel-extracted amplicons were sequenced (GeneWiz) and analyzed using Sequencher 4.1 software and compared with HRV reference sequences from GenBank using the nucleotide-nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ([BLAST] www.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) algorithm. Trimmed sequences were aligned using Geneious R6.1 (Biomatters) and Seaview 4.4 [25]. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstrap replicates using PhyML 3.0 within DIVEIN [26]. Neighbor joining trees were drawn and edited using FigTree v1.4.1. Sequences were considered to be divergent genotypes if they differed from other study sequences by >2% when compared using BLAST [23]. Sequence data were not of sufficient length to be submitted to GenBank but are available upon request.",

Adverse birth outcomes such as LBW, SGA, and PTB were also assessed using log-linear regression. Potential risk factors analyzed include (1) maternal febrile respiratory illness during pregnancy and, simultaneously, (2) a specific history of HRV-associated respiratory illness. For the outcomes of LBW, we also included a term indicating HRV-associated respiratory illness in the second trimester, to assess whether timing during pregnancy was influential. To avoid confounding, additional covariates included season of birth and infant sex in the analysis. The Wilcoxon-rank sum statistic was used to compare symptom duration between pregnant and postpartum women with febrile HRV as well as pregnant women who gave birth to LBW infants compared with those who did not.",

The median gestational age at infection among the febrile HRV respiratory illness group was 28 weeks (IQR, 12\u201339). Incidence of HRV was similar by baseline characteristics, including maternal age, maternal literacy, nulliparity, indoor biomass cookstove use, and number of children in the household. In particular, no difference in maternal body mass index was observed. In addition, no difference was observed in influenza vaccination status between the 2 groups. Other viruses detected in association with febrile respiratory illness episodes included respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, influenza, coronavirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus each occurring at notably lower frequency compared with HRV.",

Of 2752 infants with birth weight measured in the first 72 hours, 84% (2302) were taken on the day of birth. Median weight in those measured on days 2 and 3 of life was approximately 0.1 kg lower than those measured on day 1 (2.73 at day 2 and 2.69 at day 3 vs 2.80 on day 1), and the proportion determined to be of LBW increased from 24% on day 1 to 27% on day 2 to 36% on day 3.

The lack of HRV infection in the first trimester is due to enrollment of women into the study beginning at 17 weeks gestation or later rather than lack of rhinovirus infection during the first trimester of pregnancy. Low birth weight prevalence was not affected by the trimester of pregnancy in which the HRV infection occurred (P = .91). Febrile HRV respiratory infection occurred year-round with a peak in October (Figure 2) and accounted for a consistent 5% of respiratory virus infections each month. Low birth weight occurred at a monthly rate of 20%\u201330% (Supplementary Figure 2).

Use of subjective fever as criteria for respiratory illness rather than use of a measured temperature may have also decreased our ability to detect respiratory illnesses. We also did not conduct surveillance before 17 weeks gestation, and, therefore, it is possible that some women had infections earlier in pregnancy that we were not able to identify in our study. Gestational age dating was limited by lack of first-trimester ultrasound; however, 5-weekly prospective home surveillance minimized maternal recall error of last menstrual periods. Illness episode severity measures, such as radiographic evidence of pneumonia or use of supplemental oxygen, were not evaluated because medical records of healthcare visits were not reviewed in this study. We were also unable to assess medical comorbidities in the participants, given the lack of access to primary or antenatal care in the study region. Other limitations include lack of detection of bacterial pathogens in this study. Human rhinovirus infections have been shown to augment respiratory bacterial colonization and infection; therefore, it is possible that bacterial infections may be contributing to the described febrile illnesses and play a role in the relationship with LBW. Mid-nasal samples were only obtained once weekly, and brief episodes of viral shedding, as commonly observed in adults with pre-existing immunity, could have been missed. The association of virologic factors, such as viral load or subtype, with disease severity, were also unable to be assessed due to a lack of a method to quantify rhinovirus by our RT-PCR assay and our limited ability to sequence the majority of the isolates. The study was performed within a single geographic locale with specific demographics and risk factors, compromising generalizability. Finally, because this is an observational study, we were unable to assess for a causal association between rhinovirus febrile respiratory illness and LBW. The groups with and without rhinovirus infection were similar in baseline sociodemographics, including factors that may affect LBW or risk of respiratory viral infections, such as maternal parity, maternal body-mass index, maternal literacy, household smoking, household density, and running water.",
