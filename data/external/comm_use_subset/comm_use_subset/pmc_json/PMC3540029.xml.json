            "text": "Adeno-associated virus vectors based on serotype (AAV) 2 have shown great promise for therapeutic gene transfer when targeted to immune-privileged sites [1], [2], [3], but their efficacy has been modest when targeted to other tissues such as during hepatic gene transfer [4], [5]. This suggests that cell-specific barriers affect the transduction potential of these vectors. A thorough understanding of the biological interactions between the virus and its host cellular environment is thus necessary to design optimal gene transfer strategies aimed at either in improving their transduction efficiency or in their ability to evade host cellular immune response. Previous studies have demonstrated that several steps in the life cycle of AAV vector influences its transduction efficiency including the receptor-co-receptor binding [6], internalization, intracellular cytoplasmic trafficking to the nuclear membrane [7] and viral uncoating [8]. Following attachment to cell surface receptors [6], AAV2 enters the cell by receptor mediated endocytosis through clathrin and dynamin dependent internalization process [9]. The sub-cellular events after internalization have not been completely elucidated. Recent studies have shown that the virions are trafficked through acidic endocytic compartments followed by retrograde transport to trans-Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -Golgi intermediate compartment or the ER [10]. This endosomal trafficking of AAV results in the acidification of its capsid and contributes to its escape into the cytoplasm. It is increasingly clear that each of these intracellular trafficking steps constitute a major rate-limiting step for AAV transduction [11]. For eg., pharmacological inhibition of endosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 [12], [13] or disruption of golgi apparatus by brefeldin A [13] negatively impacts AAV transduction by 10 to 100 fold, respectively. Remarkably, while the inhibition of ER stress by proteasome inhibitors [14] or in cellular models [15] has been shown to improve the transduction of AAV, conversely, the role of AAV vector load induced stress on ER compartment and its ensuing signalling events are not known.",

            "text": "The ER is the organelle where proteins are modified and folded into their native conformations. While correctly folded proteins are transported further into the trans-Golgi network [16], the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, causes stress and leads to activation of a coordinated adaptive program called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The process is initiated by sequential and complex activation of three sensor molecules namely, protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1\u03b1), whose functions are regulated by immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). The activation of PERK leads to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2 \u03b1), leading to a general reduction in protein synthesis as a measure to counteract ER stress [17]. However the mRNA of ATF4, the downstream target of PERK can bypass this translational inhibition since it has upstream open reading frames. This ATF4 translocates to the nucleus activating a set of target genes necessary to bring back the cellular homeostasis [18]. The cellular stress can also translocate ATF6, a transcription factor, to the golgi apparatus, where it is sequentially cleaved by site-1 protease (S1P) and S2P and gets activated. The cleaved ATF6 translocates to nucleus binding to ER-stress response elements (ERSE) and induces transcription of several genes, including BIP, CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) [19]. When the third arm of UPR, IRE1 is activated by trans-autophosphorylation, its endoribonuclease domain cleaves a 26 nucleotide intron from its target XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) mRNA, thus performing an unconventional splicing. Spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) protein is a potent transcription factor which then translocates to nucleus to bind to UPR elements (UPREs) and activates many genes that are crucial for restoring cellular homeostasis [20]. This highly regulated UPR response to ER stress reduces the demand on the protein-folding machinery and protects cells from further damage. However, in conditions where the sub-cellular accumulation of the misfolded proteins is beyond the processing capacity by the UPR there is a co-ordinated activation of apoptosis and cell death [21].",

            "text": "A massive influx of exogenous proteins such as in the case of viral infection is also known to trigger UPR, to maintain cellular homeostasis [22]. Several viruses such as herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and others are known to induce ER stress and UPR signalling pathways [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. While some of them such as influenza virus and rotavirus manipulate these UPR pathways to establish its productive infection [29], [30] many viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus and Tula virus succumb to its activation due to cross activation of UPREs [22]. NF-\u03baB is a major transcription factor activated in response to UPR signalling that results in immune clearance of the hepatitis B (HbX) and hepatitis C (NS4) viral protein [31], [32], [33]. These examples underscore the critical role played by the UPR signalling in regulating viral infections. In AAV2 mediated gene therapy, the concept of capsid protein dependent immunotoxicity is well documented [5], [34] and several groups have shown that cellular cytoplasmic surveillance mechanisms such as the NF-\u03baB signalling [35], MYD88 pathway or toll-like receptor (TLR-9) [36], [37] signalling influence this process. Since some of these pathways are directly influenced by UPR activation, we hypothesized that AAV2 infection induces ER stress and activates cellular UPR. To test this, our studies were designed to comprehensively analyze the role of the three major UPR signalling arms in the life cycle of AAV vectors both in vitro and in vivo.",

HeLa cells were thus mock- infected or infected with ssAAV2 or scAAV2 vectors at an equal MOI (5\u00d7103 vgs/cell) and total RNA was extracted at different time-points, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h.p.i. The UPR target gene expression levels were measured by quantitative PCR at each of the above mentioned time-points. As can be seen in Fig. 1, at 12 h.p.i. compared to mock infected cells, the transcript levels of BiP (16 fold), a major regulator of ER stress and the sensor molecules of the UPR such as PERK (9 fold) or IRE1\u03b1 (11 fold) were up-regulated against scAAV2 while this activation was less prominent against ssAAV2 vectors. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2) demonstrated a similar increase in UPR pathway proteins in scAAV2 treated cells between 12\u201348 h.p.i. As can be seen in Fig 2H, components of PERK pathway such as phospho-elF2\u03b1 levels gradually increased from 2 h.p.i (1.3 fold), 12 h.p.i (1.6 fold), 24 h.p.i (2.6 fold) declining at 48 h.p.i (2.4 fold) while PERK itself was maximally up regulated at 48 h.p.i (Fig 2I). A similar increase (1.4 to 2.0 fold) was seen for IRE1\u03b1 protein between 2 h.p.i to 48 h.p.i (Fig 2J). However, a less prominent increase in PERK and IRE1\u03b1 pathways was seen with ssAAV2 vectors (Fig 2C\u20132D). As would be expected, the levels of UPR pathway proteins seems to gradually increase between 2\u201348 h.p.i concomitant to peak transcript levels detected at 12 h.p.i with AAV vectors. While the basis for the differential induction of UPR between ssAAV2 and scAAV2 is not clear, it is possible that the UPR signalling pathways in response to scAAV infection may be regulated by toll-like receptor (TLR) family members. It is noteworthy that TLR-9 is known to be activated in response to scAAV2 infection but not against ssAAV2 [36]. The role of TLRs in UPR activation is also well documented [39], [40]. However, this UPR activation is not likely due to the accumulation of the transgene (EGFP) product as HeLa cells transfected with dsAAV-EGFP plasmids did not activate this ER stress response (data not shown).",

On conditions of ER stress, IRE1\u03b1 oligomerizes and generates sXBP1. RT-PCR analysis of XBP1 splicing at different time points (2\u201348 h.p.i.) demonstrated peak levels of sXBP1 transcripts (ratio 0.55-sXBP1/XBP1) at 12 h.p.i (Fig. 3) a time point at which its activator IRE1\u03b1 transcripts was also maximal (Fig. 1B). A similar induction of the other downstream targets of PERK pathways (ATF4 or CHOP, 3.5 and 2 fold, respectively) was also observed (Fig. 3). Taken together, the maximal increase in IRE1\u03b1 and PERK gene transcripts as well as the induction of their downstream targets such as sXBP1 or ATF4/CHOP at 12 h mirrors the time-frame at which these vectors move into the ER during their intra-cellular trafficking [11]. A similar wave-like induction of the UPR pathway has been noted for other viruses such as HCV with peak levels of UPR gene transcripts reached between days 3\u20135, in a manner that coincides with viral replication [41].",

Western blot analysis of cellular extracts from cells transduced with AAV2 or AAV6 vectors showed marked depletion of PERK and IRE1\u03b1 protein levels which correlated with a concomitant increase in EGFP expression from these vectors (Fig 5C). The knockdown of PERK pathway alone seems to have only a negligible effect on AAV mediated gene expression. While the basis for this is not clear, it is possible that PERK inhibition cannot completely reverse the protein synthesis block induced by AAV vectors in the transduced cells [51].

To study this, we compared the expression of various inflammatory/chemokine genes in mice that received scAAV2 vectors alone, compared to mice that had been treated with the UPR inhibitor, metformin, prior to hepatic gene transfer with scAAV2 vectors. As shown in Fig. 7, a variety of genes involved in pro-inflammatory response (interleukin-16 (IL16), IL2 receptor gamma (IL2rg)) as well as other molecules involved in the propagation of chemokine response to AAV (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 11 (Ccl11), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (Ccl12), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 22 (Ccl22), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 24 (Ccl24), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 13 (CXCL13), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 15 (CXCL15) and chemokine C-C motif receptor 2 (Ccr2) were significantly suppressed by UPR inhibition.

However, depending on the strength of UPR activation, the cells can no longer have the opportunity to restore cellular homeostasis and may eventually lead to apoptosis. It is intriguing though how an identical scAAV genome packaged in either of AAV1 or AAV2 or AAV6 capsid can activate different UPR signalling pathways.

These data are in agreement with previous observation in a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator misfolded variant cellular model of constitutive ER stress, where activating or blocking the IRE1\u03b1 pathway did not have any major effect on AAV transduction [52].",

            "text": "Our studies also demonstrate that the acute ER stress induced by scAAV2 facilitates cross-talk between UPR and innate immunity, as has been recently described for several viruses [27], [53], [54]. In particular the link between IRE1\u03b1/sXBP1 driven activation of janus kinase (JNK) or phosphotidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway or mitogen associated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) that mediate a NF-\u03baB dependent activation of anti-viral innate immune response is being increasingly recognized [47], [55]. Our previous studies have documented that recombinant AAV vectors activate the classical NF-\u03baB pathway during their cytosolic entry in the acute phase of AAV infection (<2 hrs), and leads to cross activation of alternative NF-\u03baB pathway (>8 hrs) manifesting as a trigger for several of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1\u03b1, IL6), TNF\u03b1, IL12\u03b1, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) [35]. In line with these observations, we have identified in this study that several of the NF-\u03baB dependent pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated during the course of UPR induction to scAAV2 vectors. Furthermore, the selective ablation of UPR in vivo, attenuated both the hepatic UPR and the pro-inflammatory state and improved the transgene expression, suggesting that transient suppression of UPR pathways prior to AAV vector administration might be beneficial.",
