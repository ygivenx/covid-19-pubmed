RABV is present on all continents except for Antarctica and has reservoirs in terrestrial species as well as bats (Chiroptera). Although vaccination and antibody therapy is effective in treating known exposures to RABV, an estimated 55,000 human deaths occur annually mostly in developing countries [1]. RABV is a member of the Lyssavirus genus, family Rhabdoviridae. The genome is composed of negative-sense single-stranded RNA, about 12 kb in size which codes for five proteins- nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L). Like other RNA viruses, RABV has a high mutation rate due to the high error rate of the polymerase, thus populations of RABV exist as a mutant swarm, or quasispecies [2]. RABV evolution is believed to be driven predominantly by purifying selection and RABV is not known to recombine [3]\u2013[6].",

Typically, interspecies transmission of rabies virus from reservoir to non-reservoir host produces a single fatal spillover event secondary transmission has rarely been observed [7]. For example, a bat variant may infect and cause disease in skunks, but it does not transmit efficiently within the skunk population and skunks would be considered a dead-end host for this variant. The exception to this would be the case of cross-species transmission (CST) where the variant from one species adapts to transmission by a new species [8]. For example, in 2001, bat variant rabies adapted to transmission within the skunk population in Flagstaff Arizona [9], and in 2009 this variant adapted to transmission by foxes [7]. These events demonstrate the capacity of rabies virus for CST which may lead to increased exposure of humans to the pathogen and increase the geographical range of the virus.",

In 2009, only 2 skunks were reported rabid in Humboldt County suggesting that rabies infections in foxes had fundamentally shifted from a typical pattern of spillover from skunks to foxes to one resulting from fox-to-fox transmission. The reported numbers underestimate the extent of the outbreak since additional foxes exhibiting unusual or aggressive behavior were euthanized but not tested (S. Chandler, USDA, personal communication). This epizootic of rabies in Northern California raised concerns not only because the primary species involved was gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and not striped skunks which are the terrestrial reservoir species in this region, but also because this led to a significant spike in attacks by rabid animals on humans and their pets [12].",

Primers were designed to be as sensitive to target strain variants as possible, while still being specific enough to not cross-react with non-targets. Sensitivity was achieved by targeting regions of high sequence similarity, identified through a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the target sequences. Specificity was achieved by targeting regions that do not appear to be similar to any other organisms, determined by searching a database of known genome sequences. Primer candidates were selected based on the combined results of the MSA and sequence searches. This technique is a modified version of the approach outlined in Slezak et. al. [16], which accommodates degenerate primer design for diverse target genomes, and places a lower relative priority on primer uniqueness as compared to other known genomes. For rabies virus, which lacks perfect primer-length conservation around the genomic regions of interest, it was necessary to identify degenerate primers for many non-conserved primer regions. From the identified primer candidate regions, which included both perfectly conserved regions and degenerate regions, individual primer pairs were selected which provided overlapping coverage of the DNA being sequenced. Final checks were performed which helped avoid hybridization problems such as primer dimerization.",

All rabies reads were initially mapped to GenBank rabies reference sequence GI:260063801. This reference sequence was used as the common coordinate system for comparing samples and identifying coding frames. Based on a later observation that this newly sequenced rabies virus genome could differ by approximately 9 relative to our selected previously sequenced reference fox rabies sequence, we checked to see if observed error rates would increase by introducing random mutations at 9 of the control reference sequence, however, no noticeable increase in error rates were observed, suggesting that read mapping parameters were able to tolerate this rate of divergence.",

The few disagreements in consensus base calls between 454 and Illumina were resolved either by taking the base call with far superior coverage or omitting the base call from data analysis entirely. In most cases the disagreement was due to low coverage of the loci by one platform (just above the 50 cutoff) compared to coverage by the other platform (500).

Historical samples were defined as those collected between 1995 and 2000. Eleven loci were found to have such amino acid inversions, their frequency distributions for the historical and outbreak haplotypes are shown in Figure 5 A and B respectively. Although the frequencies of these two haplotypes sum up to 100 at a given loci in all samples (except for outlier entries colored white indicating no data and black indicating absence of these two haplotypes and presence of a third haplotype), the dominant haplotype tended to be near 100 (values below 100 have a median of 99.86) and the minor variant had extremely low presence (median 0.15, therefore could not be visualized if only one heatmap was presented). The outbreak haplotypes (shown in black letters at the bottom of the heatmaps) began as low frequency variants (0.04 to 6.03) in the historical samples and rose sometime between 2003 and 2009 to become the dominant haplotypes (94100) in most of the outbreak samples (Fig. 5B) while the historical haplotypes (shown in red letters in the heatmaps) went from being dominant (98100 presence) in the historical samples to low level variants (0.051.95) in most of the outbreak samples and even completely disappeared in seven of the outbreak samples (Fig. 5A).

The frequencies of sub-consensus variants at the inversion sites were compared to that of variants at non-inversion sites present in the 1995 samples (but not enriched to the consensus level in the 2003/10 samples) to determine if those variants at inversion sites were present in higher numbers in the pre-outbreak samples. The average frequency of sub-consensus variants at inversion sites was slightly but significantly higher than that of sub-consensus variants at non-inversion sites (p0.03, two-sample t-test one-tailed). Samples of individuals from relatively early in the outbreak (prior to July1, 2009) had increased likelihood to have the 1995 consensus haplotype detected at the inversion sites as a sub-consensus mutation, although the difference fell short of statistical significance (p = 0.08).",

Stop codon mutations were shown to be maintained within the dengue virus populations, leading to altered viral fitness and thus influencing transmission dynamics [23]. Likewise, it has been shown that human respiratory syncytial virus mutants lacking the G gene are still able to form infectious particles in vitro\n[24]. Multiple mutations resulting in a premature stop codon were observed in the deep sequencing data from this study. Sixty-seven and 116 stop codon mutations were detected across all samples in the 454 and Illumina data respectively, at the mean frequencies of 0.50 and 0.14, respectively. At five genome locations, both 454 and Illumina detected stop codon mutations occurring in the same samples at comparable frequencies. These five positions are 1418 in Fx4 (1), 2790 in Fx23 (1), 2976 in Fx23 (1), 5860 in Fx45 (1), and 8470 in Fx48 (1). These pre-mature stop codons identified by both 454 and Illumina strongly support the presence of defective genomes present in the viral populations of multiple samples. Since many examples of pre-mature stop codons occur with low frequency values it was expected that many Illumina calls would be missed with the lower coverage of 454, hence Illumina results on the stop codon distribution are provided in Figure S8. For example, at locus 7375 almost all samples sequenced by Illumina showed a low frequency (0.10.2) stop codon variant that were not detected by 454.",

Next generation sequencing technology has recently been used to examine viral heterogeneity of rabies genomes present in infected tissues but has not yet been optimized for detection of rare genotypes (less than 1) [26].

During this time there were also 2 samples obtained from rabid skunks, one from Eureka in October 2008 and one from Arcata in April 2009. The collection of 1 skunk to 4 fox samples seen in Eureka is not exceptional there was 1 skunk sample and 4 fox samples collected in Humboldt Co. in 2007 (a nonepizootic year). In 2003, 4 skunk samples were collected along with 10 fox samples. Thus collection of 1 skunk sample and 21 fox samples from Arcata during 2009 is exceptional and one may speculate that this was driven primarily by fox-to-fox transmission. In support of this notion, the online postings of local papers (i.e. Times-Standard, Humboldt Sentinel, Arcata Eye) were searched for articles relating to rabid skunks and foxes during 2009.
