While much attention has been given to the H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes, because of their disease severity in humans, another subtype, H9N2, has widely circulated in poultry in many regions of the world. H9N2 was first detected in turkeys in 1966, shorebirds in 1988, and then in ducks and chickens1, 2. It is now the most widespread and prevalent influenza virus in Asia. The government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region implemented interventions starting from 2001 to control this infection, by executing a mandatory monthly rest day, live quail sale ban, and in the subsequent years a biweekly rest day in the wet markets. Prior to these interventions in live bird market trading, the H9N2 virus isolation rate in Hong Kong\u2019s live poultry markets was around 5% of all birds tested increasing to almost 20% in game-birds such as quail3. These isolation rates are presumably similar in the greater China region in which H9N2 is regarded as the most prevalent subtype of influenza in chickens (reviewed in ref. 4), where market interventions applied in Hong Kong have not been used. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the three main lineages (Korean, G1 and Chicken/Beijing/1/94-like) of H9N2 viruses have developed from Ck/Bei and reassorted, with other H9 strains1.",

Laboratory confirmed cases of H9N2 infection in humans have been reported in 19997, 8, 20059, 200810 and 201311 and it appears that immunocompromised individuals may be more susceptible to H9N2 infection10. The early human H9N2 cases were identified in Hong Kong from 1999 to 20039, 12 (reviewed in ref. 10), in children who presented with a mild influenza-like illness. Later cases identified in Hong Kong10 and Mainland China11 occurred in adults. These isolated cases might only reflect the tip of the iceberg, as the high prevalence of anti-H9 antibodies among poultry workers in China13, Vietnam14, and Iran15 raises the possibility that mild or asymptomatic infection of H9N2 in human could be common.",

For many years the ferret has been used as a surrogate human model for influenza studies reviewed in (Belser et al.)20 and there has been limited data on replication competence in the ex vivo respiratory organ culture of ferret with good validation. We sought to explore the tissue tropism of the wild type H9 viruses isolated from poultry and humans in the ex vivo cultures of the human bronchus and lung and to investigate if there was any unique viral genomic signature which would determine successful replication in the human airways and which would act as a predictor, or correlate of infection in humans. We also sought to explore the how previously characterized changes in the internal viral proteins would affect replication as well comparing the N1 against the N2 for replication competence. As changes in amino acid at position 190 in haemagglutinin (HA) have been proposed to affect receptor binding21 and serial passage in animal models has also been demonstrated to affect replication22. We produced a recombinant virus with this change with 464419/H9N2 as the\ufeff backbone (listed in Table 1 and Supplementary materials, Table S1) in our assessment in ex vivo human respiratory tissue cultures.\n",

Immunohistochemistry studies indicated that there was infection of the bronchial epithelium (Fig. 1A\u2013E), and the lung (Fig. 1G\u2013K). The lung ex vivo cultures infected with human H9N2 viruses, 1073 and 464419 showed a greater extent of infection than other two H9N2 strains, 2108 and 226995 (Fig. 1G and J). Virus replication kinetic data indicated there was no significant increase in the viral titer in the bronchus with 1073, 2108 and D190E, over the infection time course (Supplementary materials, Figure S1A,B and E). Since the thermal inactivation curves of these H9 viruses showed a drop of infectious virus titer  to undetectable levels by 24 hpi (Supplementary materials, Figure S2), the extent of the overall viral replication was assessed with the area-under-curve (AUC) analysis using a trapezoid rule. The AUCs calculated from 24 to 48 hpi above the detection limit of each virus were compared (Fig. 1F and L). In the bro\ufeffnchial\ufeff (Fig. 1F) and lung cultures (Fig. 1L),\ufeff 1073 (pink dots) and 2108 (orange dots) showed significantly less replication when compared 464419 and its mutant D190E.

The more extensive infection observed in 2WF10 infected bronchial tissues (Fig. 3C) could be contributed by the balance of the HA and NA in 2WF10 rather than the avian-HA and the human-NA of the 1WF10. Strikingly, the internal gene cassette of human H3N2 (Fig. 3D and H, 2WF10:6M98) significantly increased the replication competence of the virus in the bronchus (Fig. 3Q and S, green dots) when compared to 1WF10 (p = 0.023) and 2WF10 (p = 0.001).\n",

Furthermore, it can be seen that comparing 2WF10:6M98 (Fig. 3D and H), the ferret adapted P10 has a compromised replication competence in the human bronchus and the lung. Moreover, the mutations of P10 in HA and NA acquired would contribute to the less competence phenotype, with the fact that 2P10:6WF10 replicated less in the human bronchus (p = 0.14) and in the lung (p = 0.0013) when compared to WF10. The mutated surface proteins were less fit to replicate in the human respiratory tract.

The early H9N2 viruses that infected humans contained a deletion of two amino acids (38 and 39) in the stalk region (similar to G1), but also contained similar glycosylation sites with other N2s12. NMR spectroscopy was used to assess NA activity of the wild type G1 virus (N2_G1_WT), a reverse genetics virus where the two amino acid deletions were restored (N2_G1_38KQ) and a reverse genetics virus with a mutation in P431K which this substitution could change the orientation of the NA 430 loop and influence Sia binding24. The main role of viral NA is to cleave Sia from the epithelial surface as well as facilitate viral penetration through the sialylated mucus layer. While all Sia in humans is primarily N-acetylatyed (Neu5Ac), certain animal species such as pigs have a high degree of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). High throughput studies by Li and colleagues have demonstrated that NA activity is more efficient in cleaving 2\u20133 linked Sia than 2\u20136 linked Sia, with human viruses also efficient in using Neu5Gc as a substrate25. Since certain amino acid changes in NA may lead to a shift in cleavage preference from Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc, and thus affect tissue tropism, we produced recombinant viruses that contained these signature amino acid changes and examined the NA activity using 3 substrates that contained Neu5Ac \u2013 3 sialyllactosamine (3SLN), 6\u2013sialyllactosamine (6-SLN) and Neu5Ac-Gal, and a substrate containing Neu5Gc (Neu5Gc-Gal). In all three viruses studied, there was a greater cleavage of the 3-linked Sia than the carbon 6-linked Sia (Fig. 5A\u2013C). Supplementary materials, Table S1 shows that only four of the H9N2 viruses had this stalk deletion (G1, Y280, 1073 and P10) by amino acid sequences comparison. However this did not appear to have any effect on replication in the ex vivo culture of human bronchus or lung tissues by comparing the viral replication competence of H9N2 viruses with residues 38\u201339 deletion in NA stalk, 1073 and P10 with other viruses without this deletion such as 2108, 226995 and 464419 (Fig. 1F and L) and did not affect the preference between Sia \u03b12\u20136 glycan or Sia \u03b12\u20133 glycan cleavages (Fig. 5B), although the overall enzymatic activities were slightly higher with the 38KQ insertion in NA.\n",

In order to assess whether there was a difference in the replication abilities of different H9 viruses, we utilized a previously established ex vivo culture system to investigate the replication ability and tropism of H9 viruses. We found that apart from the P10 virus from ferrets, all H9 viruses were able to infect the ex vivo bronchus and lung with greater replication identified in the lung than the bronchus. This overall lower replication ability in the bronchus may be due to a loss of balance between HA and NA, so that even though virus is being produced, the activity of the NA prevents efficient virus release. Indeed, electron microscopy on two of the bronchial samples showed increased numbers of viral particles on the surface of the epithelium (Supplementary materials, Figure S3).",

When the H3N2 internal genes were replaced with a triple reassortant internal gene (TRIG) cassette, respiratory transmission was possible in ferrets leading to clinical disease. If the internal genes were from pH1N1 in mice this also led to documented clinical disease.",

Amino acid changes in the HA have been shown to determine the cell tropism by altering this \u03b12\u20133 or \u03b12\u20136 binding affinity27, and HA-Q226L of avian H9N2 viruses plays a key role on this switching23. Sequence analysis of the viruses used in our study (Supplementary materials, Table S1) shows that only the Dk/2030, Ck/Yu341, and 464419 (H9N2) maintained the Q226 but were not similar in the distribution of viral antigen and replication in the bronchus and lung. Wan and colleagues in 2008 demonstrated that the amino acid leucine (L) at 226 was the crucial determinant for direct transmission of avian H9N2 in ferrets with more replication in the upper respiratory tract and multi organ dissemination23. They also showed aerosol transmission in ferrets when the H9N2 avian-human reassortant (2WF10:6M98) that caused direct transmission between ferrets was serially passaged in ferrets, leading to the acquisition of additional amino acid changes in the HA27. Recently, a HA-E190D mutation (the HA 190D is usually found in human seasonal influenza viruses) is observed in a human H9N2 virus (A/Hong Kong/464419/2009), but this virus still contained the HA-226Q that maintained preferential binding to Sia\u03b12\u20133 rather than Sia\u03b12\u2013610. The D190E substitution appeared to have no effect on replication as assessed by AUC. One of the human isolates had a D190V change (2108) and this appeared to have the lowest replication in the lung tissues.",

This finding indicates that the viruses with airborne transmission in the ferret model might not always have efficient replication competence in the human bronchus and thus extrapolation of these data to virus transmissibility between humans may not be straightforward.

As some ex vivo infections had positive IHC but low virus replication, this suggests that a low virus release may be a more likely scenario. We have demonstrated that replication in the bronchus and the lung differs between the rgH9N1 and rgH9N2 (Fig. 4), and that in the serially passaged virus 1P10 has greater replication than P10 (Fig. 3T). Thus it is possible that one of the main reasons for the poor transmission between humans of H9N2 would be the N2 is not well-adapted or \u201cfit\u201d for the human airway. It has previously been reported that there is a difference in cleavage of substrates between the N1 and N2 with the latter showing a lower substrate specificity than N131. Our NMR and N2 mutation assay confirmed that 2\u20136 linked Sia (which comprised most of the mucin of the upper respiratory tract)32 was less efficiently cleaved than 2\u20133 linked Sia (Fig. 5A\u2013C).",

In contrast, Y280 contained a deletion of three amino acids (position 63\u201365), however many other H9N2 isolates (including those that were isolated from the 2008 and 2009 human H9N2 infections) have no deletions33. This stalk deletion has been associated with an adaptation of viruses from waterfowl to terrestrial poultry, and was present in the emergence of the H7N9 virus that infected humans in 201334. This deletion increased replication in mice and chickens with increased severity of primary disease35, though it was not the case in the ex vivo infection of human respiratory tissue by 1073 and P10 in this study. Furthermore, a recent study on the amino acid changes in NA resulting in airborne transmission in chickens36 showed that none of the amino acid changes in the airborne transmissible and non-airborne transmissible virus involved the stalk.
