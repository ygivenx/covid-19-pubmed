In addition, surveillance capacity for such detection can be costly, and many countries lack the public health infrastructure to identify outbreaks at their earliest stages. Furthermore, there may be economic incentives for countries to not fully disclose the nature and extent of an outbreak.7, 8 Therefore, a new computational method is required to predict the outbreak of epidemic diseases only based on available data, thus simplifying information gathering and monitoring processes.",

It is a generalized methodology to identify the tipping point or pre\u2010transition state which is a critical state before the catastrophic event,9, 10 by mining the dynamical information from both horizontal high\u2010dimensional data and longitudinal historical records. Regarding the influenza outbreak as a tipping point at which the system undergoes a critical transition, then there is a common understanding that the dynamical process of the system can generally be expressed by three states (Figure 1B), that is, a normal state with high resilience, a pre\u2010outbreak state (the critical state) with low resilience, and an after\u2010outbreak state with possible high resilience. The normal state is a steady stage, during which there are no many clinic visiting patients. The pre\u2010outbreak state is defined as the limit of the normal state immediately before the tipping point. In this pre\u2010outbreak stage, the process is usually reversible to the normal state if appropriately treated, implying the criticality of the pre\u2010outbreak state. Unlike the traditional detection of the after\u2010outbreak state, the DNM enables the identification of the pre\u2010outbreak state or critical state that generally has no clear abnormalities but with future trending of deterioration or critical transition. This method has recently been successfully applied to a variety of biological progresses to detect the early\u2010warning signals to an irreversible catastrophic stage, such as the cell differentiation process,11 the process of cell fate decision,12 the critical transition in the immune checkpoint blockade\u2010responsive tumour,13 the multi\u2010stage deteriorations of T2D,14 acute lung injury,15 HCV induced liver cancer,16 cancer metastasis,17 and many others.18, 19, 20, 21 In this study, DNM method was employed to explore the dynamical information based on a combination of city network and the high\u2010dimensional clinic hospitalization records, which are from over 278 clinics distributed in 23 wards in Tokyo, Japan, and 225 clinics distributed in 30 districts in Hokkaido, Japan. The results show that the DNM method successfully identified the critical state just before the outbreak of influenza as a real\u2010time surveillance system. Such a system may enable a rapid response for the preventive care or the implementation of interventions to a health epidemic. In addition, this work unveils the influenza transmission dynamics or landscape in a local district network level, based on the measured data. The advantage and effectiveness of the DNM\u2010based system is also demonstrated by the comparison between DNM and other surveillance systems of flu pandemic.",

The dynamical process of flu outbreak can be modeled by three states or stages (Figure 1) similar to disease progression9: the before\u2010outbreak state, which is a stable state with high resilience or high robustness to perturbations; the pre\u2010outbreak/critical state, which is the tipping point just before the catastrophic shift into the outbreak state and is thus characterized by low resilience or low robustness due to its critical dynamics, but is still reversible to the before\u2010outbreak state with appropriate control management; and the outbreak state, which is another stable state with high resilience or high robustness.

On the other hand, the dynamic network marker/biomarker (DNM/DNB) method was developed to quantitatively identify the tipping point or the critical state during the dynamic evolution of a complex system based on the observed data. Theoretically, when a complex system is near the critical point, there exists a dominant group (a dominant group of variables or members) defined as the DNM features, which satisfy the following three necessary conditions based on the observed data9:\nThe correlation (PCCin) between any pair of members in the DNM group rapidly increases;The correlation (PCCout) between one member of the DNM group and any other non\u2010DNM member rapidly decreases;The standard deviation (SDin) or coefficient of variation for any member in the DNM group drastically increases.\n",

The 2\u2010fold change threshold is usually applied to recognize the significant changes in DNM score and obtain the warning signal. The DNM theory has been applied to a number of analyses of disease progression and biological processes to predict the critical states as well as their driven factors.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22 In this work, by considering the flu outbreak process as a non\u2010linear dynamics process, we further applied the DNM method to detect the tipping point or the early\u2010warning signal of flu outbreak.

It can be seen that both the local DNM for each node and the correlation between each pair of adjacent wards are at a low\u2010level at the beginning of the process (the 22nd\u201034th week). When the system approaches to the outbreak point, the signal arises to indicate the abnormal change in the whole network, that is, both the local DNM and the correlation between adjacent wards increases sharply, which are the necessary conditions of the DNM. Besides, it is seen from Figure 5E that the initial signal (the first red node) appears in Chuo Ward (node 3) in 34th week, which is consistent with the historical records (Table S1). The dynamical evolution of network shows that the DNM\u2010based system uncovers the epidemic situation and transmission trends, which better present the transmission dynamics at a system network level.",

Those outbreaks cause sickness, deaths, and quarantines, which are the three main factors which would result in reduction of human wellness as well as worker productivity. The deterioration in worker productivity would directly lead to a substantial impact in the economy. Additionally, transportation and production industries, for instance, would be heavily affected by the flu pandemics due to reasons such as border closures. According to ABARE, an Australian Research Agency, economy and industries in many countries will be seriously affected, for instance, Japan was predicted to have a decrease of 6.1% in gross domestic product (GDP) due to flu pandemic. From time to time, new strains emerge and cause global pandemics. To fight against influenza epidemic, it is of great importance to construct a monitoring system dependent solely on robust information, such as the hospitalization counts. In this study, DNM method shows its potential and power in detecting the early\u2010warning signals to the influenza outbreak, which may lead a new way of public real\u2010time surveillance for epidemic diseases.",

It should be noted that the DNM\u2010warning system presented in this work is solely based on counts of hospitalization. Given more clinic information and new discriminant input patterns, DNM\u2010based monitoring system is expected to reliably predict the flu outbreak in terms of sensitivity and accuracy.
