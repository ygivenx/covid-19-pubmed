Such classifications demonstrate the structural diversity exhibited by proteins in nature; develop our understanding of proteins; and facilitate comparisons between structures. Further, protein-structure classifications provide inspiration for protein designers to identify the structures that are not yet present in these schemes and then construct them de novo (Kuhlman et al., 2003; Michalopoulos et al., 2004; Thomson et al., 2014; Zaccai et al., 2011). However, the ever-increasing deposition rate of new structures into the PDB puts considerable pressure on classification schemes to be fully automated to remain up-to-date and to be truly useful.",

One problem with existing classifications is that the gaps are generally difficult to define; i.e. how do we enumerate the dark matter? We sought a classification scheme for existing structures and the dark matter, as well as means that could delineate them. The system we have designed is fully automated, and its basis in mathematical graph theory is general enough that it can be readily applied to a diverse set of protein motifs.",

To address this, we used an alternative method for classification, which emulates the Periodic Table in structure (Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009). This is similar to approaches used by others for classifying secondary structure combinations in proteins and protein complexes (Ahnert et al., 2015; Taylor, 2002).",

            "text": "Coiled coils comprise two or more \u03b1 helices that pack tightly together via interdigitation of side chains in a geometry known as knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing (Fig. 1) (Crick, 1953; Lupas and Gruber, 2005; Woolfson et al., 2012). A knob is a side chain projecting from one helix that packs into the hole formed by four side chains on an adjacent helix. Extended regions of KIH packing cement the core of a coiled coil, locking hydrophobic faces of amphipathic helices together away from solvent. The program SOCKET (Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001) finds KIH interactions within protein structures and, therefore, can identify coiled coils automatically. Application of SOCKET to the PDB has delivered the CC+ database (http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/ccplus/search/) (Testa et al., 2009), from which the Periodic Table of Coiled Coils (PTCC) (Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009) has been manually curated. However, the number of structures in the PDB has more than doubled since the PTCC was introduced and an update is overdue. Furthermore, and importantly for protein design, the \u2018dark matter\u2019 of coiled coils is not explicitly defined in the PTCC, making it difficult to identify the next design challenges. For example, there are clear gaps in the first row of the PTCC beyond the classical and abundant coiled-coil dimers, trimers and tetramers; though these gaps are being filled to some extent through the de novo design of so-called \u03b1-helical barrels, which have 5 or more \u03b1 helices arranged about a central super-helical axis (Thomson et al., 2014; Woolfson et al., 2012; Zaccai et al., 2011).\n",

The objects form the nodes of the graphs (which for coiled coils are the \u03b1 helices), and the interactions between them form its edges (the KIH contacts). Graph theory is the robust mathematical framework built from this generic definition, and its applications emerge in diverse fields including operational research, genetics, linguistics, geography, sociology, architecture and many others (Wilson, 2010). In terms of applications to protein science, graph theory has been used in the form of Protein Structure Networks (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016), for studying the rigidity of proteins (Sim et al., 2015), probing the evolutionary constraints on amino-acid mutation (Parente et al., 2015), comparing spatial arrangements of secondary structure elements (Grindley et al., 1993), and representing pathways of protein\u2013protein interactions (Huang et al., 2014). Here, we apply tools from graph theory to address the problem of automatically classifying existing coiled-coil protein structures and partially enumerating the \u2018dark matter\u2019 of that protein structural space. We make particular use of the catalogue of graphs presented in the book \u2018An Atlas of Graphs\u2019 (Read and Wilson, 1998), and therefore refer to our system as the Atlas Classification. This is an updated catalogue of natural structures combined with an enumeration of some of the \u2018dark matter\u2019.",

We highlight the automatic identification and classification of a subset of previously unclassified coiled-coil structures, namely the \u03b1-helical barrels.

Briefly, this proceeds as follows: Given a protein structure, the \u03b1 helices are extracted and the centroid of the side-chain is stored for each residue. The helices are then considered in a pairwise manner. For each residue on the first helix, the four closest side-chain centres from the residues on the second helix are determined. If each of these four distances is less than a user-specified cutoff distance (the SOCKET cutoff, scut), then this is recorded as a KIH interaction with the residue on the first helix as the knob residue, and the four residues on the second helix forming the associated hole residues. The value of scut defines how tightly the knob must pack in the hole: reducing scut decreases or maintains the number of KIH interactions that are detected.",

However, iSOCKET confers several advantages over the foregoing program. The original program required a user-defined distance cutoff for assigning KIH (default 7.0 \u00c5), which were assigned in a binary fashion. The updated program collects all KIH at a deliberately large distance cut-off value (10 \u00c5), and allows the user to select any threshold below this. This allows for a more-generous assignment of KIH interactions. Additionally, arbitrarily large structures can be analyzed, including complex coiled coils and larger structures containing multiple coiled coils, with both mmCIF and PDB files formats being handled. iSOCKET also enables analysis of the protein structural environment that surrounds each individual KIH interaction, thus making it a powerful tool for analyzing coiled-coil packing in detail. Within iSOCKET, convenience methods have been added for analyzing the packing geometry of individual KIH interactions in detail. Properties defined in detail elsewhere (Walshaw et al., 2001; Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001, 2003), such as the knob-type, the depth of side-chain interdigitation, the core-packing angle, and the complementarity of the KIH interactions may all be calculated easily for both parallel and antiparallel coiled coils.

The Atlas of Graphs (Read and Wilson, 1998) is an enumeration of all possible simple graphs with \u2264 7 nodes, which we refer to as small simple graphs. There are 1253 such graphs, which can be ordered by complexity and named accordingly (Read and Wilson, 1998). The trivial graph, containing no nodes and no edges, is named \u2018G0\u2019; \u2018G1\u2019 contains just one node; and the complete graph with 7 nodes and 21 edges (the maximum number possible) is named \u2018G1252\u2019 (Fig. 2A). It is theoretically possible to extend the Atlas to include larger simple graphs (Brinkmann et al., 2013), although exhaustive enumeration rapidly becomes impractical as the number of nodes increases; for example, the number of distinct simple graphs with 17 nodes surpasses Avogadro\u2019s number by a factor of more than 400. In our classification scheme, the coiled-coil graphs identified using iSOCKET are categorized according to their position in the Atlas of Graphs (Fig. 2A).\n",

This is converted to a simple graph and each of its connected components is classified separately (i.e. as individual coiled coils) via isomorphism to the Atlas of Graphs. With reference to Figure 2A, the graphs associated with a coiled-coil dimer, a hexameric barrel and the complex coiled coil in Figure 1 are \u2018G3\u2019, \u2018G105\u2019 and \u2018G163\u2019, respectively. A structure containing a separate dimer and trimer has two connected components: \u2018G3\u2019 and \u2018G7\u2019. Provided that the coiled coil contains \u2264 7 helices, its representative graph will be determined rapidly. For larger, complex coiled coils, we must confront the combinatorial explosion that prevents the Atlas of Graphs remaining exhaustive for larger graphs. Pragmatically, we introduce larger graphs as they are encountered: a graph that does not fit into the set of existing categories defines its own category and thus the Atlas of Graphs is expanded. Specifically, the graph corresponding to the first coiled coil to be encountered that contains > 7 helices is added and named as the previously unseen graph \u2018U1\u2019. The second such coiled coil is then either isomorphic to the first (and so belongs to the \u2018U1\u2019 category), or initiates another new category \u2018U2\u2019. All known coiled-coil structures can be categorized in this way.\n",

As the graphs get larger, the chances of two similar structures being placed into distinct categories increases, and so the specificity of the classification diminishes. As a counterpoint to this, there is greater sensitivity as many of the categories were more-densely populated. For example, there were 38 structures represented by G163. Manual inspection revealed these to be viral insertion proteins; this unsupervised classification scheme has grouped together structures of similar function, outside of its initial remit of coiled-coil classification. Strictly maintaining more-restrictive cutoffs would not group these structures in this way.",

            "text": "It is misleading to view a single combination of scut and kcut as being representative. To capture all the structures in the PTCC that correspond to small simple graphs for instance, scut must be varied between 7.0 and 7.5 \u00c5, and kcut between 2 and 3. The graphical representation of an individual coiled coil may be sensitive to parameter values, as demonstrated in Figure 4D for a structure of hemagglutinin (PDB code: 4bsa) (Xiong et al., 2013). Fixing kcut = 2 and setting scut = 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0 \u00c5 resulted in three different graphs. At low scut, only the central trimer was detected, but as it was increased, interactions were also found between the helices of the trimer and three outer helices. This pattern was common for the set of structures that were G163 for at least one of the 20 parameter combinations. The antiparallel six-helix bundle represented by G163 is a unifying feature of class 1 viral fusion proteins; these facilitate membrane fusion and therefore viral entry into host cells (Bosch et al., 2003; Harrison, 2015; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Markosyan et al., 2009). Central to this function is the large-scale conformational changes that switch the structure between an extended trimer and six-helix bundles. In this case, our structural classification scheme automatically grouped structures together that share a clear structure-function relationship.",

For iSOCKET, this limitation was corrected, and it interprets all barrels as cyclic graphs (Fig. 2A). All cycles from 3\u20137 are captured in the Atlas of Graphs and there are corresponding coiled-coil structures for each of these (Fig. 4A). Larger cycles are not part of the Atlas of Graphs and so barrels with more than 7 helices are not represented. However, our classification protocol (Fig. 3) updates the Atlas with larger graphs as they are encountered, and it is simple to extract the cyclic graphs from this set.

Importantly, considering the exponential growth in protein structures deposited to the PDB, the classification is automatically generated and so is readily updateable. Visualization of the Atlas gives a simple overview of the classification (Fig. 4), depicting each category of coiled coil as a simple graph. Interactive tools allow straightforward adjustments of well-defined structural parameters used to identify the coiled coils. Relaxing these parameters identifies larger, more-complex structural forms: showing the continuum between tightly packed coiled coils and looser arrangements of helices. These changes may be relevant for protein structure, stability and function (Hulko et al., 2006; Lupas and Bassler, 2017; Swain et al., 2009). When classifying large, complex arrangements of helices, subtle differences between structures may result in them having different graphs and being categorized separately. By grouping large graphs that share properties such as having the same number of edges or containing a common subgraph, or using more than two structural parameters to filter further, useful automated meta classification layers could be implemented to tailor the classification.",

Furthermore, extant coiled coils are shown in the context of all possible coiled-coil structures; i.e. alongside the \u2018dark matter\u2019 of coiled-coil space (Taylor et al., 2009; Woolfson et al., 2015). In this way, we see the small extent to which natural coiled coils, and the currently small number of designed structures, have sampled the available structural space. By contrast, in the PTCC dark-matter structures can only be inferred by their absence. Other than for simple cyclically symmetric structures (in effect, the top row of the PTCC) this is difficult using the PTCC, and entirely impractical to do systematically. Focusing on the expanded set of these cyclic graphs for example yields the first formal classification of \u03b1-helical barrels (Fig. 5), further demonstrating the utility of the automated scheme. This Atlas of \u03b1-helical barrels presents a clear set of targets for protein designers (Huang et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2014; Woolfson et al., 2015; Zaccai et al., 2011). This is not restricted to soluble proteins: one of the octameric regions identified is from Wza (2j58) (Dong et al., 2006), that we recently used to guide the design of a membrane-spanning \u03b1-helical peptide barrel (Mahendran et al., 2017). Classifying membrane proteins using our scheme yields an Atlas of transmembane helix packing (Niitsu et al., 2017). These are challenging but potentially useful targets for design in bionanotechnology and synthetic biology (Joh et al., 2014).",

Both of these will be challenging because, by definition, there are no examples to seed searches or to provide design principles, such as sequence-to-structure relationships needed to guide rational design (Woolfson, 2005, 2017). However, exploring this so-called \u2018dark matter\u2019 of coiled-coil space should be aided by recent developments in modelling and, specifically, in parametric protein design (Grigoryan and Degrado, 2011; Huang et al., 2014; Parmeggiani et al., 2015; Thomson et al., 2014; Wood et al., 2014, 2017). In this way, it is now possible to build models and optimize sequences for new coiled-coil structures. The \u2018dark-matter\u2019 graphs from the Atlas that are themselves composed of graphs for which there are existing structures, and that do not have any nodes with more than three incident edges, represent the best starting candidates (Boyken et al., 2016). The explicit \u2018dark matter\u2019 in the Atlas of Coiled Coils highlights the scale of the challenge faced by protein designers, but also, we hope, provides some inspiration.",

Indeed, the nodes need not be secondary structure elements at all: they could be domains, or chains within a larger protein complex. To classify another protein architecture (or indeed, anything else) it is only this first step\u2014explicitly defining the nodes and edges and therefore the conversion into graphs\u2014that needs to be re-implemented. Since the Atlas Classification scheme is not exhaustive for graphs with >7 nodes, it is most useful where this limit is not frequently exceeded. It could be applied, for example, to the categorization of \u03b2-strands interacting via hydrogen bonds or protein\u2013protein interactions identified by mutually buried surface areas.",
