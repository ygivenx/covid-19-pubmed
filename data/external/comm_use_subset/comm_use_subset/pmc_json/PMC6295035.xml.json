Several experiments have been performed to investigate the effects of MNV infection on scientific research. For examples, experimental infection of the mice revealed that MNV-1 lead to the persistent infection and long fecal virus shedding [2]. MNV-4 infection induced multiple inflammatory hallmarks of human Crohn\u2019s disease in Atg16L1HM mice after dextran sodium sulfate administration [11]. Whereas, another study reported that transient or persistent norovirus infection didn\u2019t alter the pathology of intestinal inflammation and fibrosis induced by Salmonella Typhimurium infection in C57BL/6 mice [12]. As no clear conclusion can be made from the previous studies regarding to the effects of MNV infection on biomedical research in mice, the use of MNV-free mice was recommended for fundamental research and drug safety evaluation. Thus, the rapid and sensitive detection methods for MNV infection played a critical role in the quality control of the laboratory mice.",

Considering that the RT-PCR and RT-qPCR methods are time-consuming, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for detection of MNV was developed [16]. However four to six primers were required in the LAMP assay [16]. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), another isothermal amplification method, which requires only two primers, has been recently used for pathogen detection and only takes less than 30 min to perform the amplification reaction [17\u201321]. RPA primers bind to DNA template by bacterial recombinase enzyme, then the extension and amplification reaction is initiated by an isothermal polymerase [22]. These enzymes are in concert with a reverse transcriptase and a fluorescent probe for real-time detection of the viruses containing RNA genomes [23].",

The RT-RPA assay was performed eight times on the serially diluted RNA standards, in which 8 out of 8 (8/8) runs were positive when viral load are 106\u2013102 copies per reaction; 5/8 runs were positive when 10 copies per reaction; and 0/8 positive when 1 copy per reaction was used. To evaluate the reproducibility of the RT-RPA assay, semi-logarithmic regression analysis was performed using the data from the 8 runs (Fig. 3a). A probit regression analysis using the results of 8 runs was performed to determine the exact detection limit, and the results showed that RT-RPA could detect 70 RNA molecules in 95% of cases (Fig. 3b). The synthesized templates carrying seven point mutations were also tested by the RT-RPA assay to evaluate the broadly reactive capacity of the assay. The result showed that the RT-RPA assay can detect the mutant template as few as 102 copies/\u03bcL molecular RNA (data not shown), indicating that the point mutations had no effect on the sensitivity of RT-RPA assay.",

MNV infection may affect the results of biomedical researches [16], so it is of vital importance to confirm the MNV-free status of the laboratory mice. Several real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed for detecting MNV. However, these techniques could not detect all the MNV strains due to the genetic diversity of MNV [5, 15, 26]. Thus two broadly reactive real-time RT-PCR assays were established to detect MNV infection [27, 28]. Although the real-time RT-PCR assay is sensitive and specific, it is expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive. To overcome the shortcomings of the real-time RT-PCR, a broadly reactive LAMP assay was developed for detection of MNV. However, the LAMP assay required five primers, which increased the difficulty of primer design for MNV with genetic diversity. A portable and user-friendly method is therefore necessary for rapid detection of MNV on site. One promising solution is the RPA assay. Due to its convenience and portability, the RPA technique has been used for rapid detection of various pathogens, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus [29], Zika virus [30], human norovirus [24] and pathogenic bacteria [31]. Up to date, there is only one report about the RPA assay for the laboratory animal health monitoring [32].",

The sensitivity of the RT-RPA technique for detection of MNV in clinical samples was 95.8% when compared with the RT-qPCR assay. Only one sample containing low RNA titer (27 RNA copies) was tested negative by RT-RPA. We believe that this was due to the low RNA copies (27 RNA copies) in the sample and low analytical sensitivity of the RT-RPA technique. However, the MNV RT-RPA assay was 10 times more sensitive than the RT-RPA for detection of human norovirus reported in a previous study [24]. It is worthy to note that the limit of detection of the human norovirus RT-RPA assay was performed on serially diluted RNA extract of stool. The sensitivity of present study was determined using a purified in vitro transcribed RNA rather than RNA extract of stool which may contain a lot of other RNA that interacts with recombinase proteins and thus can harm sensitivity. This may explained the difference of sensitivity between the two RPA assays. The RT-RPA assay could detect human norovirus in directly boiled stool, and displayed better resistance to inhibitors than a commonly used RT-qPCR assay [24]. It is promising to detect MNV in directly boiled animal tissue or stool samples by the RT-RPA assay in the future.

Homogenates of the tissues were produced with Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). The homogenates after two freezing-thawing cycles were clarified by high-speed centrifugation and the supernatant fluids were collected for RNA extraction and RT-RPA assay. All the samples were also tested by the RT-qPCR method previously described [27]. Linear regression analysis of RT-RPA threshold time (TT) and RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were performed by Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, USA).",
