The Ebola outbreak in West Africa during 2014-2015 showed that pathogens which previously caused small and easy to control outbreaks had the potential to infect thousands of people under the right circumstances [2]. This is also a concern for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which until now has been the cause of sporadic cases and hospital outbreaks [3]. To date, there have been 2220 confirmed laboratory cases worldwide, with 790 deaths [4]. All MERS index cases are linked to the Arabian Peninsula. Dromedary camels have been identified as a reservoir of MERS-CoV with occasional zoonotic transmission to humans [5,6]. Human-to-human transmission is also common, with around 30% of the MERS cases reported to WHO being health care associated [7,8]. However, the source of infection of many index cases remains unclear [9,10].",

Since that period, massive changes have occurred in people\u2019s lives and in animal husbandry across the Arabian Peninsula. Understanding these changes may help to reconstruct the events that led to the emergence of MERS-CoV as a human disease. Past research identified several drivers of emerging zoonoses, such as urbanisation, population growth and demography, and environmental and agricultural changes [12,13,14]. The drivers which could have potentially influenced the MERS-CoV emergence in humans have only sporadically been investigated [15,16]. By reviewing changes involving humans and camels over the past 30 years in Qatar, this study sought to identify the key drivers of the emergence and spread of MERS-CoV.",

Using a structured interview guide (Supplementary 2) and a moderator, a series of 4 interviews were conducted in Arabic, each lasting approximately for 3 hours. The main themes that were covered during the interviews included: (changes in) people\u2019s living conditions; customs and purposes of camel ownership; cultural habits related to camels; educational level and personal behaviors of camel owners and workers; camel movement; demographic distribution of camels in Qatar; camel farming practices: feeding, grazing, and slaughter. A detailed transcript was shared with the experts for authentication. A literature search was done to complement findings from the quantitative and qualitative study, using PubMed, Google Scholar and the local sources of information including the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME), Ministry of Development and Planning Statistics (MDPS), and Qatar Statistical Authority (QSA).",

In response to demands for a larger workforce after the exploitation of oil and gas began, foreign laborers started to migrate to Qatar from countries in the region, like Palestine, Oman, Iran, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Later, immigrants from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Indonesia joined the older migrant populations, increasing the number of inhabitants to 369,079 by 1986 and recently to 2,617,634 (Figure 2A) [23]. In 2016, non-Qatari males made up 78% of the residents of working age (15-64) and non-Qatari made up more than 90% of the total number of Qatar inhabitants older than 15 years of age (Figure 2B,C) [24]. Most recent estimations of the origins of the non-Qatari population are that 25% is Indian, 11% Bangladeshi, 14% Nepali, 10% Filipinos, 9% Egyptian, 5% Pakistani, and 2% Iranian [25]. The total number of males in Qatar increased from 67.2% of the total population in 1986 to 75.5% in 2016 (Figure 2B). In 2004, almost 50% of residents were between 15 and 39 years old, and this has risen to more than 60% in 2015 (Figure 2A).

The Bedouin nomadic lifestyle gradually decreased as most of the Qatari tribes shifted to an urban, settled lifestyle; cars and planes rapidly replaced camels as transportation means. This transformation to a more sedentary lifestyle is reflected in the profile of comorbidities. More than 70% of adults are overweight and almost half of them obese [28]. Male obesity increased from 17% in 1986 to 34% in 2014, which is extremely high compared to the current 11% prevalence in men worldwide [29]. In 1998, 7% of residents above 15 years were hypertensive, rising to 14% in 2006, and 33% in 2012 [30,31]. Prevalence of high blood sugar among adults in 2015 was 14%, compared to a worldwide prevalence of 9% [28]. The Qatar Stepwise Report reported in 2012 that 15% of adults were daily smokers. Yet, Qatar has a low death rate: 1.49/1000, compared to the worldwide death rate of 7.72/1000, and its healthcare system has developed rapidly over the past twenty years [28,31,32].",

With the changing life style and increasing wealth, the purchase and breeding of (expensive) racing camels came within reach of an increasingly large segment of the Qatari national population. According to experts, although camel racing has traditionally been part of the Bedouin culture, the organized racing business went through major changes over the past decades. This was partly due to financial and regulatory support from the Qatari government. This support increased the social and economic value of camels in Qatar, further stimulating their popularity. The Al-Shehaniya camel-racing track, one of the biggest tracks in the Gulf, was opened in 1990 [33]. The camel farms that are located near the Al-Shehaniya camel racing area are mostly used for racing camels. There are about 1500 racing camel holdings at the Al-Shehaniya camel racing area. Some of the camels in Qatar are used to compete in camel beauty contests that are organized around the Arabian Peninsula. According to the FAO, in 1960 there were about 6,000 camels in Qatar. This rose to over 43,000 in 1992, 50,000 in 2000, and more than 90,000 in 2016 (Figure 1B). More than 83% of the animals are currently kept for racing [34]. Across the Gulf region, Qatar has the highest camel density, with 6.77 units/km2, compared to 4.74 units/km2 in United Arab Emirates (UAE) and 0.11 units/km2 in the KSA [35]. In 2005, the total number of camel farms was 1300 and by 2014 it had increased to 9594 [34].",

Overgrazing of the green areas due to the increased population of camels and other livestock accelerated the desertification of Qatar [36]. Therefore, the government decided to assign natural protected areas in 2004 [37,38], and started to sanction the free grazing of livestock since 2005 [39]. By 2011, open grazing was completely banned [40]. According to the experts\u2019 opinions, this led to changes in farming practices, as herds were then moved outside of Qatar to areas where free grazing remained possible. Moreover, in Qatar, camels are now raised in closed systems and within 1 of 9 designated farming areas (camel complexes) in the residential districts. Camel workers also live on the premises of the camel complexes. Typically, a camel complex has a reception room (Majlis) for social activities of the camel owners. The Al-Rayyan municipality, where the Al-Shehaniya camel racing area is also located, currently holds about 83% of the total camel population and 61% of camel holdingss (Figure 3) [34,35]. According to the experts, this newly adopted closed farming system led to the increase of disease incidence, especially of parasitic diseases. However, we did not find any disease statistics to substantiate these findings.",

After being weaned, young camels are directly taken for acclimatization (during the period mid-July through mid-August) from the general livestock farms (located across the region) to the racing farms, mostly located within the Al-Shehaniya area. This involves drastic changes in feeding systems, intense training for races, and mock races alongside camels from other farms and older training camels. The off-season for camel racing is during summer (mid-April to August) (Figure 4). During this time, most of the owners travel abroad, the frequency of visits to the farms substantially decreases, and workers are permitted to take annual vacations. From September onward, training intensifies, in preparation of the racing season, which lasts from mid-September through mid-April. During that time, 14,000 registered camels from different origins, ages, gender, nationalities, and breeds compete together at the Al-Shehaniya camel-racing track. During the racing season, up to 24 rounds take place, approximately five days per week.",

Experts believe that the ban of open grazing in Qatar played a key role in the intensity and frequency of camel movements. They mention that there has been a remarkable increase after 2011 in numbers of camel workers and owners who cross the borders to and from KSA along with their animals, although this recently stopped with the KSA-Qatar political situation. The ban of open grazing stimulated camel owners to establish farms in KSA and UAE where open grazing is still permitted. Therefore, camels are moved through Gulf Countries, particularly during the winter season.",

This discovery led to massive economic growth. Owning a camel represents the wealth and status of its owner in Arabic culture. Governmental sponsorship of camel ownership and camel racing further stimulated the camel industry, especially the camel-racing sector. This in turn lead to an accelerating increase of the camel population, a change in camel farming, and a concomitant increase in the number of camel workers [34]. The human population of Qatar has increased by 7-fold over the last decades [23]. This is unlike other high-income countries, that have a yearly overall population growth of only 0.6% [20]. Population growth and high population density have been shown previously to be important risk factors for disease emergence [42]. Moreover, consistent with the disease profile of wealthy countries where sedentary lifestyle prevails, the prevalence of chronic diseases increased in Qatar in accordance with the increasing GPD, ultimately rendering the Qatar population not only vulnerable to virus transmission, but also to its deadly complications [43].",

Recently it has been shown that the MERS-CoV spike can rapidly adapt to species variation in DPP4 [45]. As such, the increasing human-animal interface that is described in this paper may have facilitated the adaptation of the spike protein to human DDP4. However, much remains unknown, also in view of the findings that MERS-CoV from East Africa were not phenotypically different from the viruses from the Middle East, while human MERS patients have not been reported from the African continent [46].
