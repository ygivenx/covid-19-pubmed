            "text": "Bats, comprising the second largest mammalian population in the world and distributed globally with the exception of the two polar areas, belong to the order Chiroptera with 17 families and 925 species [1]. Bats are important virus reservoir animals and more than 60 viruses have been identified in them with many highly pathogenic to humans [2], including henipaviruses, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, dengue virus, lyssaviruses and SARS-like coronavirus [3]\u2013[7]. Most recently, Bokeloh and Shimoni bat viruses, circovirus, bocavirus, retrovirus, astrovirus, and Cedar virus have been identified as new bat viruses with some never having been reported in other animals, suggesting that bats could be a large virus bank and breeding ground for viruses [4], [8]\u2013[15]. In China, viruses are increasingly being detected in, or isolated from bats, such as coronavirus, circovirus, astrovirus, Xi River virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Chikungunya virus, Tuhoko virus, picornavirus, adeno-associated virus and adenovirus [5], [9], [14], [16]\u2013[22]. Notably, SARS coronavirus, which has infected more than 8,000 people and killed almost 800 worldwide, has been identified as likely originating from horseshoe bats in China [5], [23], [24]. However, all available studies so far fail to provide a complete understanding of the pathogen ecology of bat populations.",

Availability of next generation sequencing-based viral metagenomics in recent years has provided a powerful tool for large-scale detection of known and unknown viruses existing in host animals [25], [26]. This new technology has been employed to explore the constitution of viral communities in such environments as oceans, lakes, various tissues, guts and feces of animals including bats has undoubtedly opened a new window to an understanding of the virus diversity in these environments and has provided a successful paradigm for future rapid discovery of new viruses in nature [10], [27]\u2013[37].",

Yunnan province in China is a main and busy trading route between Southeast Asia and China and shares a long border with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. Studies have shown that many viruses, including Nipah virus, JEV, Chikungunya virus, and circovirus, are present in bats in Cambodia, Thailand and Yunnan [9], [17], [18], [35], [38]\u2013[40]. To expand these studies to Myanmar, we applied viral metagenomics to determine the virome of bats collected from areas of Myanmar adjoining Yunnan. Results revealed 24 virus families in these bats, including phages and viruses of plants and insects as well as vertebrates. Several viruses of the genera Orthohepadnavirus, Mastadenovirus, Mamastrovirus, and Bocavirus, have been characterized as new viruses. This work has expanded our knowledge of bat viruses and their geodistribution in Southeast Asia and could be helpful in establishing effective surveillance of wildlife-associate zoonoses.",

Members of the Alloherpesviridae, Herpesviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Parvovirinae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae and Picornaviridae were likely common viruses harbored by bats since at least 3 of the 4 groups contained their sequences in viral contigs.

Notably, there were >10 thousand contigs relating to Hepadnaviridae, which covered 43% full genome and shared >70% nt identity with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) and human hepatitis B virus (HBV).

In the present study, ictalurivirus-, poxvirus-, polyomavirus-, papillomavirus- and hepacivirus-like sequences were not only annotated to viruses but also share nt/aa identities with some cellular organisms, probably as a result of integration of viral genes into their hosts or host genes into viral genomes since large DNA viruses have ability to acquire cellular genes over the course of their evolution [42]\u2013[45].

In our study 35 and 22 contigs relating to genus Mamastrovirus were obtained from groups XM and WO respectively (Table 3), but none from the other two groups. Testing of all bat lungs and guts by hemi-nested PCR using pan-bat astroviruses primers targeting a 422 nt fragment of ORF1b provided confirmation, resulting in 12 and 2 positive amplifications in guts of groups XM and WO respectively. The positive rate in Miniopterus fuliginosus was 4% (12/320). In group WO, only Rhinolophus ferrumequinum showed positive amplification in 2% (2/84) of samples, while all other bat species were negative. Of 15 amplicons, 8 (Accession numbers: JX863704\u2013JX863711) were further sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed against representative astroviruses of all 19 species of Mamastroviruses based on the nt sequences. Results (Figure 1) showed that the taxonomic tree of the 19 species of Mamastroviruses based on a partial ORF1b gene was the same as that based on ORF2. Bat astroviruses detected in this study, however, could be further grouped into two branches with 57\u201363% nt identity between them. Of these, BatAstv XMM137 amplified from M. fuliginosus in county Sedon shared the highest identity of 69% with Mamastrovirus 14 found in bats from Hong Kong [12], and was likely a new Mamastrovirus species according to new ICTV criteria [48]. It was therefore tentatively classified as Mamastrovirus-related virus 1. The remaining 7 amplicons with 68\u201376% nt shared identity comprised a new group, and shared the highest nt identity (67\u201375%) with Mamastrovirus 18 found in Hong Kong bats [12]. These sequences constituted at least one new Mamastrovirus species according to new ICTV criteria, and were therefore classified as Mamastrovirus-related virus 2 [48].",

In this viral metagenomic analysis, bocavirus sequence was detected in groups XM and WM, but not in XO and WO (Table 3). The finding by specific PCR of a partial VP1 ORF gene sequence using degenerated primers designed based on available bocavirus sequences in GenBank was consistent with the metagenomic analysis, and analysis of all bat samples further showed that 2% (6/320) of guts of M. fuliginosus in XM and 6% (20/320) of M. fuliginosus in WM were bocavirus positive (Table 1). Ten amplicons (five from each group, accession numbers: JX863718 - JX863727) with lengths of 620 nt were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed against representative sequences of bocaviruses identified to date. Results showed that the newly identified bat bocaviruses were significantly divergent from known bocaviruses, with 39\u201353% aa identity. The highest aa identity (53%) observed was with canine minute virus and only 43% aa identity with M. myotis bocavirus, the first bat bocavirus found in China [10] (Figure 3B). Further phylogenetic analysis clustered our ten sequences into two independent groups. The highest amino acid identity between two groups was 85%, while that within a group was 97% (Figure 3B). This indicates the discovery of two new bocavirus species from bats. To further characterize the bocaviruses, nearly full length genomic sequences of Bt BoV XM30 in group 1 and Bt BoV WM40 in group 2 were obtained by gene walking. As shown in figure 3A, the genomes of Bt BoV XM30 with an incomplete 5\u2032 end (accession number: KC339250) and Bt BoV WM40 (accession number: KC339251) were 4,832 and 4,995 nt containing four ORFs: NS1, NP1, VP1 and VP2. (Figure 3A). The aa sequences of NS1 were used to construct the phylogenetic tree with other representatives (Figure 3C). Multiple alignments showed that Bt BoV XM30 and WM40 shared 76% aa identity, with 35\u201354% aa and 44\u201356% nt identities with other bocaviruses. The highest (54%) aa identity was with canine bocavirus HK882U but only 40% to Myotis myotis bocavirus 1, with the same results obtained by analysis of VP1 (data not shown).",

By 2007, more than 60 bat-borne viruses had been identified globally by traditional virologic methods. This required several decades and the work of numerous laboratories [2], [57]. With metagenomic analysis based on next generation sequencing and high throughput screening, the frequency of discovering new bat viruses has rapidly increased and more than 20 new mammalian viruses or distantly related variants of known mammalian viruses, along with a number of unknown viruses, have been identified in last two or three years by a few laboratories. In addition, the virome constitution of bats has been elucidated by this modern technology [10], [35]\u2013[37]. Using this tool, the present study has revealed a virome of Myanmar bats, comprising 24 viral families capable of infecting vertebrates, insects, plants or bacteria. Sequence comparisons here have uncovered new viruses, further expanding the range of virus composition in the bat population.",

Unknown sequences constituted a large part (95%) of the total with no homologs in GenBank (Table 2).This compares with 91%, 99%, 66% and 51% for unknown sequences reported in, respectively, human feces, infant feces and bat guano [37], [58]. Comparison is difficult, however, since sequence similarities are identified by BLAST search of the Genbank databases, which are continually expanding [58]. Our results showed that about 2% (26,698/1,649,512) of total contigs were virus-related sequences. However, in previous viromes, the proportions of virus-related sequences in total reads or contigs ranged from 0.1%\u201358% [10], [35]\u2013[37]. Of note is that 45% of viral contigs in our virome classified to vertebrate viruses, while insect viruses and phages constituted only 28% and 27% of viral contigs respectively (Table 3). This compares with less than 10% of total viral contigs related to vertebrate viruses in previous viral metagenomes of bats [10], [35]\u2013[37]. In addition, among 24 viral families identified here, 54% (13 families) were mammalian viruses, much higher and broader than the rates reported in previous virome studies. This difference may be ascribed to the sample type: various organ tissue samples of all bats, along with intestine contents, were used in our study, while the samples used in previous studies were only feces or feces plus oral and pharyngeal swabs [10], [35]\u2013[37]. Mammalian viruses require replication in host cells, with some, but not all, being excreted into the environment through the fecal and/or oral routes. Moreover, excretion of many viruses is intermittent, and therefore the virome obtained from excreted or secreted materials may not represent the complete viral complement of the host. Consequently, mixed tissue samples are likely to provide a more complete virome profile. For instance, since hepadnaviruses are strictly blood-borne viruses and normally not secreted through the fecal and oral routes, this could be the reason why previous metagenomic studies have not found Hepadnaviridae in any bat species. In the present study, sampling of bat livers may have permitted successful identification of a bat hepadnavirus. The fact that this constituted the largest population of mammalian viral sequences (Table 3) additionally indicates that bats are potential reservoirs of hepadnaviruses.",

The 2 positive bat species further showed differences in viral constitution with M. fuliginosus harboring Astv, Ifv, hepadnavirus and BoV, while R. ferrumequinum harbored Astv, CV, Adv and AVV, indicating the existence of co-infection with multiple viruses in both species. In addition, even the same species had a different viral constitution in different locations. For example, M. fuliginosus harbored astrovirus in Sedon, but not in Wutao; R. ferrumequinum harbored only CV in Sedon, but Astv, Adv and AVV in Wutao. These data show that bat virome varies among species and geo-locations, indicating that a complex viral ecology exists in the bat population. Similar differences in the bat virome have also been reported in previous studies [10], [35]\u2013[37], and therefore huge diversities in bat virome in the world can be expected.",

In our virome study, contigs of Ectropis obliqua and Perina nuda insect viruses were detected only in M. fuliginosus of both XM and WM groups, suggesting that these bats frequently prey on these insects. The most likely explanation for the presence of plant viruses such as tospovirus and cucumovirus in some samples is that the bats prey on insects that feed on plants.

In the present study, hepadnavirus-like contigs were the second largest population, and showed a genetic similarity to WHV and HBV.

These viruses have also been found in some avian species causing immumosuppression and growth retardation [62]\u2013[65]. However, a viral metagenomics analysis of bat guano in North America first identified their presence in bats [37]. Since then, CVs have been commonly found in bats and have shown a large genetic diversity [9], [10], [35]. According to ICTV criteria, BtCV XOR1, observed in this study, should be a new species since it shares <60% aa identity with known circoviruses [48]. Topologically, the known bat circoviruses are grouped into genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus, with some having higher similarities to other animal circoviruses than to bat circoviruses (Figure 6C). For example, BtCV XOR1 in our study shared the highest (56% aa) identity with canine CV (No.JQ821392), and only 48% identity with BtCV YN-BtCV-2 (No. JF938079).

The genetically diverse mamastroviruses consisted of 6 species in 2009 [73], but since the first bat Astv report in 2008 [12] identification of numerous new Astvs had expanded the list to 19 species by 2011, with 7 relating to bats [48]. They have been identified in several bat species including Miniopterus schreibersii, Scotophilus kuhlii, and Rousettus leschenaultia in Hainan, Hunan, Anhui, Guangxi and Fujian provinces, China [12]\u2013[14], and from M. myotis in Germany [59]. In the present study, more novel bat Astvs were detected that diverged from the current 19 Astv species, as shown in figure 1, indicating that these form new species within the genus Mamastrovirus. The continuing emergence of new mamastrovirus species and their wide genetic divergence in bats indicates that there could still be more unknown bat astroviruses.",

Our results, together with previous studies [10], [35]\u2013[37], show that the composition of bat viromes differs depending on geographical location and bat species. Current bat viromes have therefore uncovered only the tip of the iceberg as regards virus flora present in these mammals, and future studies involving a wider sampling of bat species in different locations will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the global diversity of bat viruses. However, most of the new viruses found in bats by metagenomic analysis have very low identity with known viruses and their direct transmission to cause diseases of humans and domestic animals is unknown. To determine the tropism restrictions and pathogenicity of these new mammalian viruses, routine virological approaches, such viral isolation and characterization by tissue culture and experimental infection, will still be necessary.",
