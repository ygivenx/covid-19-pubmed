            "text": "MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) are artificial pseudo-viral particles whose production is based on knowledge of the familiar bacteriophage MS2 (+ssRNA, Leviviridae)1 and the ability of its coat protein dimers to pack specific single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules2\u20134. The packaging is driven by dimerization of coat proteins followed by a specific interaction of dimers with a stem-loop structure (called the \u201cpac\u201d site) in ssRNA resulting in spontaneous formation of MS2 PLP. These particles are small in size (about 27 nm), non-enveloped, non-infectious, non-replicative, stable pseudo-viral particles with the ability to protect encapsidated ssRNA molecules against the effects of ubiquitous nucleases. Due to these properties and their morphological and physicochemical characteristics, MS2 PLP carrying specific ssRNA molecules can serve as suitable process control virus (PCV) for the detection and quantification of ssRNA viruses within a wide range of samples; for example, human norovirus (NoV), human enterovirus (EV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)2,5\u20138. Perspectives on the practical use of MS2 PLP as RNA vaccines and vaccine candidates, drug delivery systems, and systems for the display of immunologically active peptides or nanomachines are discussed in a recent review9.",

            "text": "Since the first study at the beginning of the 1990s in which non-bacteriophage RNA was encapsulated by MS2 coat protein dimers, many different methods for the production of MS2 PLP have been developed4. Currently, the production of MS2 PLP is based on various in vivo plasmid-driven packaging systems, which exploit the spontaneous assembly of MS2 coat protein dimers in the presence of the pac site inside Escherichia coli (E. coli)10. However, while each of these systems have their advantages, they are also characterized by various drawbacks, e.g., limited capacity for packaging of control ssRNA, lower efficiency of packaging, complicated system construction, or complicated and time-consuming purification of produced MS2 PLP. The newest and most advanced plasmid-driven packaging system, the so-called one-plasmid double-expression packaging system, allows construction of MS2 PLP with high efficiency and packaging specificity, and allows a maximum length of encapsidated ssRNA of up to 3,600 nucleotides (nt)11. Recently, this packaging system was even used for the construction of MS2 PLP carrying a 4,942-nt-long control sequence for Zika virus12. However, this system still does not address a major drawback of current MS2 PLP preparations: the purification procedure. Therefore, produced MS2 PLP must be purified in a time-consuming and laborious ultracentrifugation step, which does not isolate MS2 PLP in the required purity4,8,10,11,13. The problem of purification can be solved by the introduction of an affinity tag (e.g., polyhistidine-tag; His-tag) to the structure of MS2 PLP allowing their purification using the Co2+ affinity chromatography method13,14. This approach enables easy and fast purification of huge amounts of pure MS2 PLP. As the one-plasmid double-expression packaging system had not yet been developed at that time, Cheng et al. used a so-called one-plasmid expression system for production of MS2 PLP. The system has limited capacity for packaging of control sequences (up to 2,000 nt), and the particles contain undesirable sequences from bacteriophage MS210,13. Based on this knowledge, none of the previously used plasmid-driven systems for production of MS2 PLP is ideal. The novelty of the present study lies not only in combination of all the experience acquired so far with the different methods of MS2 PLP construction for developing a new plasmid-driven construction system, which integrates all the advantages and benefits of the previously described systems. This is also the first report about the construction of single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag capable to successfully form intact His-tagged MS2 PLP that can be purified in less than one hour by FPLC. Moreover, presented approach solves the previous problem of introduction of His-tag to structure of the coat protein in parallel with formation of whole intact MS2 PLP.",

            "text": "It was shown previously that the newest and most advanced in vivo system for production of MS2 PLP\u2013the one-plasmid double-expression system\u2013has great potential for the production of MS2 PLP11,12. In comparison with other previously used systems, the system developed by Zhan et al. has a good expression efficiency, produces MS2 PLP containing only defined control ssRNA sequences without any other MS2 bacteriophage sequences, and also allows packaging of long control ssRNA sequences using multiple pac sites10\u201312. However, the one-plasmid double-expression system does not enable rapid, simple, and effective purification of produced MS2 PLP. This problem can be resolved by introduction of a His-tag into the structure of MS2 PLP. This results in MS2 PLP carrying 180 His-tag epitopes, which allows their purification using affinity chromatography13. Unfortunately, at the beginning of this study it was found that introduction of a His-tag into the structure of MS2 PLP according to Cheng et al. and expression of His-tagged MS2 PLP in a one-plasmid double-expression system does not result in the production of any His-tagged MS2 PLP13. It was subsequently discovered that another group also encountered this problem and failed in the production of His-tagged MS2 PLP (Harder, Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Germany, personal communication, March 2017). Ponchon et al. also adopted the previously reported strategy of Cheng et al. and tried to produce His-tagged MS2 PLP15,16. However, Ponchon et al. used a so-called two-plasmid system where the first plasmid carried the MS2 coat protein sequence under control of an inducible tac promoter and the second plasmid carried the sequence for packaging under the control of a constitutive lpp promoter10,16. This strategy allows successful co-expression of both the protein and ssRNA in an appropriate ratio. But as a result, in all cases, it was observed that the MS2 coat protein with the His-tag only formed a dimer rather than intact His-tagged MS2 PLP16. It is known that peptide insertions into viral capsid proteins often result in protein misfolding that interferes with MS2 PLP assembly17. On the other hand, it is also known that fusion of two coat protein monomers (single-chain dimer) confers tolerance to peptide insertions in an MS2 coat protein dimer18,19. The basic idea of a using a single-chain version of the MS2 coat protein dimer with a His-tag in this study was inspired by these previously published results. The described plasmid-driven system is based on plasmid pACYCDuet-1. Plasmid pACYCDuet-1 was chosen as the basis for the new His-tagged MS2 PLP production system because it was shown to be an optimal solution in previous studies that dealt with the construction of particles or production of MS2 coat protein11,20\u201322. Zhan et al. used a one-plasmid double-expression system based on the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid for production of MS2 PLP carrying a 3,034-nt-long control sequence11. To test the ability of such a system to also pack very short control sequences, our previously reported specific control sequence with a total length of 150 nt was chosen for packaging8. The final pACYCDuet-1-TM-CoatDimer-His expression vector was constructed with a view of easily allowing subsequent modifications. MCS1 of the vector containing the sequences of maturase and single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was modified, so that the maturase sequence no longer contains the NdeI restriction site. This modification opens the possibility for using the NdeI restriction site for cloning into MCS2, which increases the maximum length of packed ssRNA control sequences, because NdeI is the first restriction site in the MCS2 of the vector. Furthermore, in the case that the NdeI sequence will be present in the sequence of maturase, direct cloning of sequences into MCS2 of the vector using the NdeI restriction site will not be possible. The inserted sequence for the His-tag is flanked by two KpnI restriction sites. This flanking is a consequence of previously used methods of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis14,23. Although the sequence of maturase and the single-chain version of coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was synthesized de novo, it was decided to maintain the presence of the KpnI restriction sites, mainly due to the possibility of easy replacement of the His-tag sequence at this position. The single-chain version of the coat protein dimer is more tolerant of foreign peptide insertions than the wild-type coat protein monomer18,19. Therefore, utilization of the described system should allow insertion of different peptides at this position without causing any problems for MS2 PLP assembly. The possibility of producing MS2 PLP carrying ssRNAs of choice and presenting various peptides on the surface of the capsid is currently a very promising method for the production of RNA vaccines based on recombinant MS2 PLP24\u201328.",

Therefore, the presented method results in the production of His-tagged MS2 PLP containing 90 His-tags in the capsid structure exposed outward from the particle and allowing chelated Co2+ on the resin beads to access the His-tag. Newly produced single-chain version coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was extensively characterized using SDS-PAGE, western blotting and MALDI-TOF analyses. The molecular weight of the wild-type coat protein measured using MALDI-TOF was 13,730 Da, which is very close to its theoretical value of 13,728.54 Da. The measured molecular weight of the single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was 28,329 Da (Fig. 4E), which is also very close to its theoretical value of 28,333 Da. The differences between theoretical and measured values of protein molecular weights are probably due to the sample preparation protocol and instrumentation used. These analyses clearly showed that the desired mutagenized coat protein with the expected properties was successfully obtained after induction. Moreover, this single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was able to create compact His-tagged MS2 PLP, which were morphologically indistinguishable from previously produced MS2 PLP2,8.",

In fact, the quantity of isolated His-tagged MS2 PLP purified through FPLC is one order of magnitude higher than the quantity of MS2 PLP purified through ultracentrifugation (~109 particles/\u00b5l; RT-qPCR quantification according to8).

The integrity of His-tagged MS2 PLP after FPLC purification was tested by TEM; the stability of particles against nucleases was also tested. In general, the ability of MS2 PLP to withstand the action of nucleases is one of their most important properties, because only intact particles are able to protect the ssRNA that they encapsulate.

It is also interesting that the intensity of bands on an agarose gel was much higher in the case of MS2 PLP in comparison with His-tagged MS2 PLP, although the quantity of tested particles was the same\u20130.7 \u00b5g per band, which corresponds approximately to 1012 particles8. A possible explanation for this difference is that the lower intensity of His-tagged MS2 PLP bands is related to a lower proportion of contaminating DNA in comparison with MS2 PLP (Table 2).",

This feature was utilized in our previously developed RT-qPCR system for quantification of MS2 PLP, which uses a two-step format in which RT and qPCR reactions are separated8. The step of particle lysis was included in the RT protocol and it was demonstrated that initial denaturation of 65 \u00b0C/5 minutes during the RT protocol is sufficient to lyse His-tagged MS2 PLP. This approach not only saves time, but also represents the gentlest method of thermal lysis and provides the highest RT-qPCR yield. On the other hand, the results of this experiment also show that the temperature of lysis has no critical effect on ssRNA stability, and, thus, the STE buffer in which the particles were diluted and lysed provided good protection to naked ssRNA molecules.",

            "text": "The purity of produced MS2 PLP is essential, and, therefore, elimination of contaminating E. coli genomic DNA from lysed bacterial culture prior to MS2 PLP purification is a part of each production protocol; usually, a mixture of DNases and RNases are used2,3,5,8,11,12. It is generally accepted that this treatment is sufficient to eliminate contaminating DNA. However, this may not be true. Cheng et al. tested the purity of MS2 PLP purified through ultracentrifugation and found that they exhibit significant DNA contamination13. On the other hand, His-tagged MS2 PLP exhibit only negligible DNA contamination (but the determined quantity of His-tagged MS2 PLP was only ~103 particles/\u00b5l). Based on these findings, the His-tagged MS2 PLP produced in this study and previously produced MS2 PLP8 were tested for the presence of contaminating DNA. Because some MS2 PLP applications, e.g., use as a PCV in RT-qPCR detection and quantification of pathogenic ssRNA viruses from a wide range of samples, require a greater quantity of MS2 PLP (~105\u2013108 particles/\u00b5l), the presence of contaminating DNA was tested in range of 108\u2013105 particles/\u00b5l. The results are consistent with those reported previously13 with the difference that His-tagged MS2 PLP are also not absolutely free of contaminating DNA, especially at higher concentrations. On the other hand, according to our findings His-tagged MS2 PLP are always at least 150,000\u00d7 cleaner through all tested concentrations (108\u2013105 particles/\u00b5l) than MS2 PLP purified through ultracentrifugation (Table 2). Moreover, the proportion of contaminating DNA decreases with progressive dilution, but only His-tagged MS2 PLP can be diluted to a quantity where contaminating DNA is not detectable in RT-qPCR. In general, the purity of isolated MS2 PLP is very important because the presence of contaminating DNA could affect quantification in experiments where particles are used as a PCV, or can confer toxic effects on MS2 PLP serving as vaccines or drug delivery systems9. Thus, the one-plasmid double-expression His-tag system presented in this work is able to meet this demanding criterion, and can be used for the production of highly pure MS2 PLP. On the other hand, the described purification method is dedicated mainly for using MS2 PLP as a PCV and for using as a vaccines or drug delivery systems it is needed to perform additional laboratory tests.",
