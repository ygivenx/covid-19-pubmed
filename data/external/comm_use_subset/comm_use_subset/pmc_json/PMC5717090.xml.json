Evidence of MERS-CoV transmission between dromedary camels (camels) and humans was initially provided through two separate epidemiologic investigations of human MERS cases in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.3, 4 In these cases, camels that had been in contact with the human cases just before their illness onset were tested and found to be positive for a genetically very similar or identical MERS-CoV as that identified in the human cases. A large serological study performed in Saudi Arabia beginning in December 2012 provided additional evidence suggesting increased risk of MERS-CoV infection among people with frequent exposure to camels. The authors reported that 0.15% of individuals in the general population were positive for antibodies to MERS-CoV, but those with camel-exposure (e.g., slaughterhouse workers) had significantly higher seropositivity, 3.6%.5 Numerous different camel sample types have been investigated for virological confirmation of MERS-CoV RNA, including nasal swabs and secretions, oral swabs, rectal swabs, blood, feces and milk; the presence of MERS-CoV RNA has most consistently been detected in nasal swabs from infected camels.3, 6 Younger camels (aged <2 years) are more likely to be MERS-CoV RNA-positive and have higher viral loads compared with older camels.7 Serological samples from as early as the 1980s show that camels in the Middle East and northern Africa have antibodies to MERS-CoV or a very similar virus.8, 9, 10 These seroprevalence results do not hold true for Bactrian camels or for dromedaries from other regions such as Australia or Kazakhstan.11, 12 While these studies support the notion that camels can be a source of human infections, camels may not be solely responsible for human MERS cases as primary cases sometimes report no camel contact. Furthermore, the receptor for MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, is fairly conserved in mammals, suggesting potential roles for other mammalian hosts.13",

Additional non-MERS-CoVs were also detected, and co-infections with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses was common. Another study sequenced 10 different camel MERS-CoVs from Abu Dhabi and found viruses in several lineages in clade B, including a sixth clade B lineage as well as a camel MERS-CoV within clade A.20 This study provided interesting insight into camel MERS-CoV diversity in nature as it is thought that the clade A MERS-CoVs are older and not circulating currently.20 Additional efforts for sequencing MERS-CoV from camels have focused on sequencing certain genes such as nucleocapsid or spike as potential spots for identifying genetic variation.7, 22, 23",

The RDP program also provided the location information of possible recombination breakpoints, which were then confirmed and/or further examined using the Distant Plot program implemented in RDP. In order to identify potential parental strains/types associated with each recombination event, the alignment was separated based on the breakpoints into non-recombined regions, each subject to phylogenetic analyses for parental strains/types identification.",

A majority of the viruses sequenced in this study, 64 (50%) of the camel MERS-CoV genomes (Figures 1A and 1B), fell within the established lineage 5 with human MERS-CoV sequences from the Republic of Korea outbreak and including some that are closely related to human MERS-CoVs. Of these, camel MERS-CoV genome MF598617 is only 15 nucleotides different than a human MERS case from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2015 (KT806051). In addition, camel MERS-CoV genome MF598618 is 30 nucleotides different than a human MERS case identified in Thailand from an Omani national (KT225476). Both of these camel MERS-CoV genomes are more closely related to the human cases than previously identified camel MERS-CoVs. Ten (8%) of the camel MERS-CoV genomes analyzed fell within lineage 2 along with other previously sequenced camel MERS-CoVs and clusters of human MERS-CoV sequences from UAE. Eight of these camel MERS-CoV sequences formed a monophyletic group with each other within lineage 2 and are closer to the human MERS-CoVs from the 2014 UAE outbreak cluster than to other human MERS-CoVs in lineage 2.50 Two (1.5%) camel MERS-CoV sequences fell within lineage 3. Lineage 3 is comprised of a number of human and camel MERS-CoVs from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

The lowest average number of nucleotide changes between distinct lineages was 39.3995 and within lineages the average number of nucleotide changes ranged between 15.786 and 27.289. We identified two potentially new lineages (6 and 7) of MERS-CoV within clade B that are distinct from previously identified lineages.21 Lineage 6 (n=2, 1.5%) contains two camel MERS-CoV sequences and does not have any human MERS-CoVs identified yet. Lineage 6 has an average number of nucleotide changes compared to previously identified lineages ranging from 36.031 to 46.545, which is near the threshold of nucleotide changes needed for consideration as a new lineage. As the topological support for lineage 6 is low, its placement in the phylogeny should be treated with caution. Forty percent (n=51) of the camel MERS-CoV genomes we sequenced fell within the other new lineage (proposed name, lineage 7). Lineage 7 has an average number of nucleotide changes 43.763\u201360.25 from the other previously published lineages, well above the lowest average nucleotide changes between known lineages of 39.399 (Supplementary Table 2). Lineage 7 is comprised of camel MERS-CoVs and one human MERS-CoV, an imported case in Germany from the United Arab Emirates.41 The camel MERS-CoVs most closely related to the German case (highlighted in yellow, Figure 1B) had just 7 and 20 nucleotide differences (MF598634 and MF598673, respectively) compared to the MERS-CoV sequence from the German patient. In the phylogeny, two additional genomes did not fall within established lineages and their phylogenetic positions were not well-supported, MF598621 and MF598663. For camel genome MF598621 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 2), the average nucleotide differences range was 28.266\u201342.818, with the closest similarity being with lineage 2 viruses. Camel genome MF598663 had an average nucleotide change of 27.728 nucleotides compared with lineage 5 viruses, suggesting a closer relationship with lineage 5 viruses.

Both pens C17 and C19 housed a mixture of camels that had MERS-CoV from lineages 5 and 7 based on the sequencing in week 3. Of the eight sets of samples which, had full or near-full-genome sequences available for comparison, camels 414377 (Figure 2B) and 414492 (Figure 2C) were sampled weeks 3 and 4 and had full genomes available for comparison with 50 and 49 nucleotide changes between the MERS-CoV genomes compared, respectively. For camel 414377, this represented a change of MERS-CoV lineage: lineage 5 in week 3 and lineage 7 in week 4. Of note, camel 414377 sampled in week 4 had identical sequence to camel 414480 that was housed in the same pen (C17, Figure 2A). Camels 414485 (Figure 2D), 414500 (Figure 2E) and 415911 (Figure 2F) were sampled weeks 3 and 4 and had between 9 and 24 nucleotide changes between weeks 3 and 4, which did not represent any changes in lineage.

A total of 10 well-supported recent recombination events were detected (Table 2), which involved 11 viruses, and the percentage of detection from this data set is thus 8.5%. Among these, 9 recombination events have single breakpoints and 1 has double breakpoints. The most common location for these breakpoints was around the ORF1b/S gene junction (Table 2). While most of the recombination events were represented by a single virus, one recombination event that occurred involved two viruses, MF598652and MF598677, which were nearly identical (one nucleotide difference) and were apparently derived from a single recombinant origin. The analysis of parental groups revealed that most of the recombination events were between lineages 5 and 7 (Table 2 and Figure 3); whereas, a single event occurred between lineages 2 and 7 (Table 2 and Figure 3, MF598700).",

Such prevalence is higher compared to the previously reported 1.6\u201315% molecular prevalence detected in camels at the borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman, slaughterhouses and farms, suggesting that livestock markets may represent a location for greater potential for human and camel infections.23, 38, 51 A total of 129 full or nearly full MERS-CoV genomes were obtained from camels sampled in this study, including camel MERS-CoV genomes that are more closely related to human MERS cases than previously available camel MERS-CoV genomes. Within lineage 5, two camel MERS-CoV genomes, MF598617 and MF598618, were more related to human MERS cases (KT806051 and KT225476, respectively) than previous camel MERS-CoVs, with only 15 nucleotide differences between MF598617 and KT806051 (differences were throughout the genome, with 1 difference in the spike gene) and 30 nucleotide differences between MF598618 and KT225476 (differences were primarily in ORF1AB and spike genes). Interestingly, while the camels sampled in this study came from UAE and Oman, the human MERS-CoV genome (KT806051) related to MF598617 was from a case in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In addition, a camel MERS-CoV that is closely related to the 2015 Germany imported case from UAE was identified with only 7 nucleotide differences, 2 of which were in the spike gene. A previously sequenced camel MERS-CoV genome was also only 7 non-overlapping nucleotides different than the 2015 Germany imported case, but that sequence was obtained from a camel in a closed dairy herd in Dubai (KT751244). This study demonstrates that livestock markets may actively participate in the spread of MERS-CoV among camels and/or humans. Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrom-CoV outbreak, which originated from a limited number of zoonotic events and then acquired characteristic genetic changes associated with more efficient person-to-person spread, MERS-CoV cases and outbreaks appear to result at least in part from multiple ongoing zoonotic transmissions. The great diversity of MERS-CoVs in humans is mirrored in the camel population as shown in this study as well as previous studies.8, 20, 21 This supports the hypothesis that some human MERS-CoV infections are a result of multiple independent transmissions from camels.8, 15",

In all, 129 full or nearly full-genome MERS-CoV sequences were obtained from 109 unique camels in this study. These camel MERS-CoV genomes sequenced were placed throughout the MERS-CoV phylogenetic tree and represented four lineages previously identified by Sabir et al.21 as well as two new lineages (lineages 6 and 7). The majority of samples fell within the established lineage 5 and the lineage 7. Lineage 5 MERS-CoV sequences include human MERS-CoVs from the Republic of Korea outbreak as well as human cases from Saudi Arabia.52 Previously, Lau et al.20 identified two human MERS-CoV sequences, KF600612 and KF600620, both from Saudi Arabia from 2012, as a potentially new lineage. Sabir et al.21 placed these two sequences as an outlier to lineage 2 and our analysis places them within lineage 2. Lineage 7 is almost entirely comprised of MERS-CoVs genomes from camels, with the notable exception of the travel-related MERS-CoV infection in a German citizen who visited a livestock market in UAE before becoming ill. We also detected smaller numbers of camel MERS-CoVs within two known lineages (2 and 3) and a new lineage, 6. Interestingly, in three separate pens there were three separate instances of highly related MERS-CoV genomes identified indicating some of the camels may have been infected at the market by their pen mates. Most of the different lineages of MERS-CoV identified were throughout the pens and of the 32 pens sampled, 16 had more than one lineage of MERS-CoV present. This large diversity of camel MERS-CoVs was detected in camels sampled from a single livestock market. This is in contrast to a large sequencing study, which sequenced camels from several cities and various locations camels were housed.21 In the previous study, camels were sampled from slaughterhouses, farms and wholesale markets in Jeddah, Riyadh and Taif within Saudi Arabia. Despite a large sample size, our study did not detect any camel MERS-CoV sequences belonging to clade A, which has been identified in a camel from UAE in a previous study.20 A recent study of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in Egypt identified a potentially new MERS-CoV lineage, however only a limited amount of the Spike gene (600 bp) was sequenced and used for comparisons.53",

            "text": "In order to understand the dynamics of MERS-CoV infection in camels over time, previous studies have sampled camels at multiple time points and sequenced MERS-CoV. Samples collected from the same animals a month apart were genetically identical. In addition, adult camels showed evidence of reinfection with MERS-CoV; they were seropositive at the beginning of the study and later in the study MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal and fecal swabs.16 Another study also demonstrated the presence of MERS-CoV RNA in camel calves sampled at an 8-day interval although genetic comparisons were not performed on those samples.54 In contrast, in the camels sampled over multiple weeks from this study, there were significantly more nucleotide changes observed between 1-week intervals than would be expected based on the known mutation rate of MERS-CoV with lineage changes between 1-week intervals observed in two camels as well. This could be due to several reasons. First, sample tracking errors may have occurred. This is highly unlikely as the camels were microchipped after the first week and the microchips were used for camel identification between different weeks. Second, it is possible that these apparent differences stem from errors in sequencing. We have done extensive comparisons of our Fluidigm Access Array/MiSeq sequencing platform compared to the gold standard of Sanger sequencing. We use the same high-fidelity enzyme for both platforms and the Fluidigm Access Array platform has one round of PCR amplification, so it has a lower chance of introducing PCR bias. Finally, another reason for the higher than expected mutation rate could be due to the presence of co-infection or reinfection of camels with multiple MERS-CoVs present in the same pen. If this were the case, each week the predominant virus could change and thus we sequenced different viruses at different time points from the same animal as we observed in two camels sampled just 1 week apart. Given the extraordinarily high number of nucleotide changes within a 1-week timeframe for camels 414377, 414492 and 415915, it seems most likely that reinfection from camels within the same pen occurred. This was also supported by the fact that although they were from different origins, highly similar MERS-CoV were clustered in the same pen, suggesting transmission occurring within the same pen. For example, in the two camels that had MERS-CoVs of different lineages in different weeks (both lineage 5 to lineage 7), they were housed in pens and had identical or near-identical sequences with camels that had lineage 7 viruses also. Another camel sampled multiple times also demonstrated significant nucleotide changes (49) in a 1-week period. Although this did not reflect a lineage switch, it could also be due to reinfection by a different MERS-CoV from the same lineage in the same pen. Lineages are based on the topology of the phylogenetic tree with support from measuring the average number of nucleotide changes, in this instance this MERS-CoV genome was above the average. A longitudinal study in a fixed camel population such as a farm would be beneficial to further understand the dynamics of natural MERS-CoV infection in camels over time.",

Comparison of MERS-CoV and the highly related Neoromicia coronavirus (from a South African Neoromicia capensis bat) indicated that a nonrecent recombination event potentially gave rise to pathogenic MERS-CoV.55 Recent studies also support recombination of MERS-CoV in camels as well, including evidence that the MERS-CoVs recently circulating in the Republic of Korea and Saudi Arabia are of recombinant origin.52, 56 We were able to detect and describe 10 recombination events in the camel samples. One recombination event was detected in two samples, representing circulation of a common recombinant ancestor among camels. The junction between ORF1b and S was the most frequently identified location for the recombination breakpoints, which is in line with previous evidence in other coronaviruses, including a recent example between feline and canine alphacoronaviruses.28, 57, 58, 59 Expectedly, few recombination events were detected between more closely related viruses, i.e., within a lineage. It is important to take in to consideration that recombination between distantly related clades is much easier to detect than between closely related viruses, for which there were few phylogenetic signals. Therefore, it is highly likely that recombination events between more closely related viruses remain undetected.",

In this study, we kept the threshold for reporting minor variants relatively high to avoid calling sequencing errors or PCR artifacts as legitimate variants, so the data represent only a subset of the potential number of variants present. The data describe a larger, more diverse group of MERS-CoV variants or quasispecies present in camels than has been described in humans. This difference suggests that within that diverse repertoire in camels, there may be only a subset of viruses capable of being transmitted and replicating in humans. Understanding and detecting these variants will be critical in describing how MERS-CoV is transmitted both zoonotically and person to person. Indeed, this has been supported by the limited sequencing of camel MERS-CoV available and is now greatly expanded by our current study. The large population of MERS-CoV quasispecies within camels, coupled with the known circulation of other coronaviruses in camels and the recombination potential between coronaviruses could lead to highly divergent and novel coronaviruses.20, 21, 28, 29, 30",

It was known that a German citizen visited a livestock market that houses dromedaries and following that visit, was MERS-CoV-positive.41 Sampling and testing of camels at the market revealed a large diversity of MERS-CoVs circulating among camels. The genetic diversity of MERS-CoVs and the frequency of recombination suggest the potential for emergence of new MERS-CoV variants, which may be able to sustain more efficient person-to-person transmission, as with severe acute respiratory syndrom. This further underscores the importance of this and related future studies to characterize this diversity and guide development of targeted interventions.",
