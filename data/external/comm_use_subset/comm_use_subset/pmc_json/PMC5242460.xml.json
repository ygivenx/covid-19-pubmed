            "text": "Within raw sewage, feces, urine and other biological fluids from thousands of humans are mixed together with food and household waste, industrial waste, and runoff water. Every individual, who is connected to the drainage system, contributes with his or hers own microbiota [1], including infecting pathogens [2]. This makes sewage an attractive matrix for epidemiological studies [3], microbial source tracking [4], and for controlling the efficacy of pathogen removal in wastewater treatment plants [5,6]. Sewage has been shown to harbor a diverse viral population including enteric, respiratory and oncogenic viruses [7]. The high viral diversity and the continuous mutation of viral species makes identification with traditional methods difficult and time consuming, therefore many studies have turned to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches instead [7\u20139]. Metagenomic sequencing of the virus associated nucleic acids is considered to be an unbiased approach enabling the detection of all known viral species, as well as the discovery of novel and emergent species [10]. Three main challenges exist for viral sewage metagenomics. First, only a small fraction of the total nucleic acids are of known viral origin, hence mechanical and enzymatic viral purification is often needed [9]. Second, the low abundance of viral particles in the samples requires the use of viral concentration methods prior to nucleic acid extraction [11] and is often combined with subsequent random DNA amplification [12]. Third, the nucleic acid extraction procedure has to cover the large variety in viral structures and genome types. To overcome these biases, different methods to concentrate viruses from water samples have been developed, including: polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG) [8], FeCl3 precipitation [13], skimmed milk flocculation (SMF) [14], glass wool filtration (GW) [15] or monolithic adsorption filtration (MAF) [16]. The influence of concentration method on viral recovery has been evaluated on sea water [17], spiked tap water [15,18] and raw sewage [19], cautioning of method associated biases. To our knowledge, no major comparison studies using metagenomics have been performed with sewage water.",

Monolithic discs, diameter 3.86 cm and height 1.0 cm, were synthesized by polymerization of polyglycerol-3-glycidyl ether (Ipox chemicals, Laupheim, Germany). An 80:20 mixture of toluene and tert-buthyl methyl ether was used as porogen to create monoliths with a pore size of ca. 20 \u03bcm. After synthesis, functionalization was performed by recirculating 10% diethylamine in 50% ethanol at 60\u00b0C through the monolithic disks for 3 h to create positively charged diethylaminoethyl groups on the pore surface. Afterwards the monoliths were rinsed with ultrapure water and stored at 4\u00b0C until further use. One liter of raw sewage was filtrated through a MAF disc (Microarray and Bioseparation Group of the Institute of Hydrochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Germany) assembled as previously described [28].

The MGmapper tool follows three main steps: quality assessment of the raw reads, mapping of reads to the reference databases, and post-processing of mapping results. Quality assessment was done using cutadapt [35] which performs common adapter removal, trimming of the low-quality ends from reads with a minimum Phred quality score of 20, and later discards reads that are shorter than 40 bp. Later, already trimmed pair-end reads were aligned to a pre-defined set of reference sequence databases using bwa mem [36] ver. 0.7.7-r441 with default settings. In this study, reads were mapped against three viral reference databases (S2 Table): whole genomes virus sequences (Virus) and viral sequences extracted from nt database (Virus_nt), obtained from Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), as well as Vipr database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245011). Samtools [37] were used to remove singletons and filter reads where neither a read nor its mate is mapped. Reads were mapped in best-mode, meaning that mapping was performed against all databases, simultaneously, and later for each read pair the best hit among all alignments is chosen. A pair of reads is considered as a hit only if the sum of the alignment scores (SAS) is higher than any SAS values from other database hits. If a pair of reads has identical SAS values when mapping to several databases, the only one pair, associated with the database that was specified first in the list of reference databases, is kept. In the last, post-processing step, alignments are filtered based on matches/mis-matches threshold. In this analysis, 70% matches/mis-matches threshold needed to be satisfied in order the hit to be considered significant. The metagenomic sequences are available from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) under accession number PRJEB15242.",

A high viral specificity also has financial implications, causing large savings on both sequencing, and for subsequent CPU hours used in the bioinformatics analyses. In this study, the PEG protocol was the best concentration method, in respect to viral specificity (Fig 3A). This might be explained by the initial filtration step, not part of the other evaluated protocols. Pre-filtration might have improved the viral specificity in the other concentration methods, although clotting might become a problem due to the increased volumes processed with these methods. The NUC had a consistent high viral specificity (three times that of POW and QIA), probably due to the effective removal of DNA from other organisms, and contaminants, during the DNase step. Overall, there was a 10-fold difference in viral specificity between the lowest and the highest method combination, highlighting the potential savings associated with choice of method. We observed a generally high viral specificity in this study compared to previous studies [45]. This might be due to the addition of the spiked HAdV, inflating the amount of virus in the sewage matrix, but should not have any influence on the method comparisons.",

Inhibitors can affect PCR amplification, quality of the prepared library, and subsequent virus detection. This theory was further supported by the qPCR results were extracts obtained from SMF had a high level of inhibition. Extraction with QIA has previously been shown to impair detection of HAdV in samples with high levels of organic matter [23]. This was also the case in our study, where extraction with QIA inhibited HAdV detection in all cases except when combined with PEG concentration which both had the lowest starting volume (0.2 L) and an additional filtration step.",

Virus species specific extraction efficiency biases are well documented in viral metagenomics [54] and should always be considered when interpreting the results.
