Using serology for Zika virus diagnostics can be challenging because of the cross-reactivity of antibodies elicited by other endemic flaviviruses \u2013 such as dengue, yellow fever, St Louis encephalitis and West Nile viruses.3,13,14 Molecular detection of viral nucleic acid using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is a highly reliable diagnostic method during acute infection. Currently, there are six widely used real-time RT\u2013PCR assays for Zika virus detection.7,13,15,16 The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has recommended an additional real-time RT\u2013PCR assay.12",

Nucleotide mutations in the binding sites of primers and probes can affect the sensitivity.17 So far, the genetic variability of the Zika virus Asian lineage causing the current American outbreak is limited to about 2% nucleotide differences across the viral genome (Fig. 1). However, mutations do not occur evenly across viral genomes. Up to 10 nucleotide mismatches between the oligonucleotide sequences of the published assays and the Asian lineage consensus sequence already exist and in individual primers or probes, there are up to five mismatches (Fig. 2). Note that these are worst-case scenarios based on the genetic variability permitted within the Asian Zika virus lineage, with no single known Zika virus strain accumulating all of these mismatches. However, the increasing number of divergent Zika virus outbreak strains highlights the genetic variability as a potential limiting factor of the sensitivity of Zika virus real-time RT\u2013PCR-based diagnostics.",

            "text": "According to preliminary studies, short-term viremia and low viral loads complicate Zika virus detection in blood.13,26 Since Zika virus RNA has been detected in urine from Zika virus-infected patients for two weeks or longer,26 we investigated whether blood or urine were the most suitable clinical specimens for diagnoses of acute Zika virus infection. We used the new NS1-based assay to quantify viral loads in 21 serum samples and 12 urine samples from 24 patients infected with virus strains from the current outbreak. As shown in Fig. 7, viral loads generally decreased during 2 to 12 days after symptom onset. Matched urine and blood samples taken on the same day were available from six patients. One patient had a lower viral load in urine, than in blood, two patients had an equal viral load in both samples and three patients had a higher viral load in urine than in blood (Fig. 8). Mean viral loads in all the available clinical samples (including those without known date of symptom onset) were 5x104 RNA copies/mL of blood (range: 1x102\u20132x106) and 2x104 RNA copies/mL of urine (range: 4x102\u20138x104). The viral loads in the 24 specimens sampled in the first 12 days after symptom onset were comparable to viral loads in serum from patients sampled during the Zika virus outbreak in the Federated States of Micronesia13 in 2007 (Fig. 9). A combined data set of 41 samples comprising the data from the 2007 outbreak (17 samples)13 and this study (24 samples) resulted in mean viral loads of 1 \u00d7 104 RNA copies/mL of blood (range: 1 \u00d7 102\u20134 \u00d7 105) and 5 \u00d7 103 RNA copies/mL of urine (range: 4 \u00d7 102\u20136 \u00d7 104). The samples were taken during comparable intervals: within 11 days after symptom onset for urine and within 12 days after symptom onset for serum samples. Two of these 41 samples contained viral loads of less than 5 \u00d7 102 RNA copies/mL (Fig. 9), leading to an estimated risk of false-negative test results of 5% even when using highly sensitive assays with a technical lower limit of detection of 5 copies/reaction (equivalent to 5 \u00d7 102 copies/mL; Fig. 10 and Table 2). Using an insensitive assay with a lower limit of detection of 1 \u00d7 104 copies/reaction, the proportion of estimated false-negative test results is about 50% (Fig. 10).",

The mean viral load of dengue was 5 \u00d7 105 RNA copies/mL (range: 5 \u00d7 102\u20135 \u00d7 108; Fig. 11), meaning that viral loads of dengue in blood were generally about 100-fold higher than viral loads of Zika virus (t-test, P = 0.03).

According to our data, the Lanciotti E-,13 the Pyke E- and NS1-,16 the Bonn E- and the Bonn NS1-based assays are highly sensitive for the Asian Zika virus lineage and show few mismatches within genomic domains targeted by these assays.

The transfer of essential reagents with coordinated implementation of laboratory protocols and practical training for staff can strengthen accurate real-time RT\u2013PCR diagnostics in resource-constrained settings.20,31\u201333 Among the most essential contributions to technology transfer is the provision of standardized control material that can be shipped internationally without biosafety concerns. Research consortia and public health structures can use these reagents to establish a technical basis for test implementation, as demonstrated for severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronaviruses.34,35 When these viruses emerged, they were novel and new diagnostic tests had to be developed along with the provision of reagents to laboratories. However, for the detection of the Zika virus, where test formulations are already available, assay standardization can only work with the provision of a reference reagent that is universally applicable in all assays, such as our uncRNA reagent or a multicentre validated natural virus standard. Quantitative comparability between studies will enable relative estimates of the transmission risks associated with blood transfusion and solid organ transplantations as well as the transmission risks from body fluids such as semen or saliva. Quantitative data may also shed light on Zika virus pathogenesis, since a higher viral load may be associated with more severe clinical complications, as shown in other arboviral infections, such as those caused by dengue, chikungunya and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever viruses.36\u201338",

A study from Puerto Rico, showed that 30 (19%) of 155 patients with suspected Zika virus disease could be laboratory-confirmed using molecular and serologic tools.40 In addition, a study from Brazil demonstrated that 119 (45%) of 262 patients with suspected Zika virus infection had a positive real-time RT\u2013PCR result.41 The higher proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases in those studies and our data suggest that a considerable proportion of patients with low viral loads may have gone undiagnosed by molecular testing during the current outbreak.",
