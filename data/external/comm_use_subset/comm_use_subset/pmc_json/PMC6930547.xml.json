During infection, the virus first binds the receptors present on host cell surfaces through glycoproteins of the viral envelope and then transitions from attachment to penetration, leading to the release of the viral capsid and tegument proteins into the cytoplasm. Later, viral capsids with tegument proteins use the microtubule network to transfer to the nuclear envelope, where they interact with nuclear pores and release their uncoated genomes into the nucleoplasm to perform viral transcription and replication. During these processes, the viruses will utilize various host cell systems to promote their own replication.",

Until now, proteomic analyses of HSV-1 have focused on virally induced changes in the cellular proteome [5,6,7] or protein post-translational modifications [8] and virus\u2013protein interactions [9,10,11] during infection. In this study, a stable isotope-labeled amino acid culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomic analysis of HSV-1 infected HEK 293T cells was performed, aiming to explore the effects of HSV-1 infection on the host proteome. An RNAi-based functional analysis was employed to explore the role of several regulated host proteins in viral replication. In addition, the host cell activates various antiviral responses to limit viral infection. The entry of HSV-1 into host cells triggers a series of both innate and adaptive immune responses, in which innate immunity plays a central role in determining the final fate of infection [12]. HSV-1 and Sendai virus (SeV) have been employed as models for DNA and RNA viruses, respectively, and have been extensively used in virus\u2013host interaction studies, especially in studies investigating the mechanisms of the host\u2019s immune response to DNA viruses and RNA viruses. A comparative analysis of the effects of SeV and HSV-1 infection on the host proteome has never been reported. Our previous SILAC-based quantitative analysis of SeV-infected HEK 293T cells highlighted several biological processes that may be involved in the viral replication process and virus-induced innate immune response [13]. In this study, we also compared the effects of SeV infection and HSV-1 infection on HEK 293T cells, and the biological processes regulated by both HSV-1 and SeV were identified. Our quantitative proteomic analysis of HSV-1- and SeV-infected cells can also help us to better understand HSV-1- or SeV-induced immune responses. ",

HEK 293T cells are highly permissive to HSV-1 infection and have low TLR and STING expression, and thus their innate immune response during infection with a DNA virus is weak, resulting in weak activation of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and related biological processes. We performed a quantitative proteomic analysis on HEK 293T cells to minimize the effect of interferons on the regulation of host proteins and biological processes. Twenty hours p.i. was chosen as the time point for late phase, because we found that the HSV-1 DNA level was much higher (Figure 1A), and no significant apoptosis can be observed at this time point. This observation is consistent with the understanding that HSV-1 takes around 16\u201320 h to complete a lytic cycle [5]. However, the intracellular mRNA levels of IFNB1 and ISG56 were comparable between 4 and 20 h p.i., suggesting that type I IFN (IFN-I) production was not activated in HSV-1-infected HEK 293T cells, which is consistent with the literature [14,15].

Then, the infected cells were harvested at 4 h p.i. and 20 h p.i., and the mock cells were collected and mixed in an equal amount. The cells were then subcellularly fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and the subcellular fractionation efficiency was confirmed by detecting lamin B1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using Western blot (Figure 1C).

These proteins were selected based on a comparison with our previous quantitative analysis of RNA virus-infected host cells. CHCHD2 was also regulated by SeV [13], and IFITM3 was regulated by JEV [16], while TRIM27 was only regulated by HSV-1. HEK 293T cells were transfected with siRNAs against IFITM3, CHCHD2, and TRIM27, and 24 h later, the cells were collected, and intracellular mRNAs were harvested for quantitative RT-PCR to test the knockdown efficiency of these siRNAs (Figure 5A). All six pairs of siRNAs decreased gene expression significantly and, therefore, were used for the following assays. Next, HEK 293T cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs, and 24 h later, the cells were infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 5. At 20 h p.i., both the cells and supernatants were collected, and the intracellular viral genomic DNA level was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 5B, the intracellular levels of HSV-1 DNA were significantly higher in cells transfected with siRNAs against IFITM3, CHCHD2, or TRIM27, suggesting that the knockdown of IFITM3, CHCHD2, or TRIM27 increased the intracellular level of HSV-1 DNA. We also determined viral titers in the supernatants, and found that the knockdown of IFITM3, CHCHD2, or TRIM27 also increased the HSV-1 titer (Figure 5C). This implies that IFITM3, CHCHD2, and TRIM27 play positive roles in defending against HSV-1 infection.",

During the last few decades, MS-based proteomic methods have contributed significantly to revealing more factors and mechanisms involved in HSV-1 infection and the corresponding host responses. A quantitative proteomic analysis using a 2D gel strategy was performed to explore the effects of HSV-1 infection on the host proteome [5,6,17]. However, due to the limits of the gel-based strategy, the number of regulated proteins identified was low. Berard et al. also performed a SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analysis of HSV-1 infected cells [7], but they only used two replicates. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of HSV-1-infected HEK 239T cells was performed. To reduce the complexity of the proteins analyzed, cells were sub-fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and three replicates were performed. A total of 6607 host proteins were quantified, of which 498 proteins were differentially regulated (Table S1). A GO analysis based on a biological process highlighted several proteins groups that were affected by HSV-1 infection. The significance of the NF-\u03baB pathway [18] and the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system [19] on virus\u2013host interactions during HSV infection have been reported repeatedly. In agreement with these reports, \u201cNIK/NF-\u03baB signaling\u201d and \u201cprotein ubiquitination involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process\u201d were enriched in our GO data.

A wealth of data has suggested that IFITM3 strongly protects host cells against a broad range of viruses, including SARS coronavirus, influenza A virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and Zika virus [23]. The antiviral effects of IFITM3 might be attributed to the blockage of virus entry by inhibiting the fusion of the virus membrane, though the mechanisms are still unclear. One possible mechanism is that by binding with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA), IFITM3 disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and blocks viral release to cytosol [24]. This is consistent with our data and explains our finding that HSV-1 increases IFITM3 expression, and knockdown of this gene leads to higher virus proliferation.",

Our previous study found that CHCHD2 can be induced by Zika virus infection in HeLa cells and may promote ZIKV replication and inhibit virus-induced IFN-I production [28]. We found that CHCHD2 was downregulated by HSV-1 infection in HEK 293T cells, and the knockdown of CHCHD2 can increase HSV-1 production in a cell culture supernatant (Figure 5).

A hybrid quadrupole-TOF LC/MS/MS mass spectrometer (TripleTOF 5600+, AB SCIEX) was coupled to a nanospray ion source. Peptides were first loaded onto a 5 \u00b5m-C18 trap column (5 \u00d7 0.3 mm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and then separated on a C18 analytical column (75 \u03bcm \u00d7 150 mm, 3 \u03bcm particle size, 100 \u00c5 pore size; Eksigent, Dublin, OH, USA). A 100 min gradient was established using mobile phase A (3% DMSO, 96.9% H2O, and 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (3% DMSO, 96.9% ACN, and 0.1% formic acid), with a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min. For the MS/MS analysis, each scan cycle consisted of one full-scan mass spectrum (with the m/z ranging from 350 to 1500 and charge states from 2 to 5) followed by 20 MS/MS events. The threshold count was set to 120 to activate MS/MS accumulation, and the former target ion exclusion was set at 18 s. The tandem mass spectra were extracted by Peakview version 2.0 (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA). The mass spectrometry proteomics data were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [30] partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD015887.",

One peptide quantitative information, as long as the peptide is unique to the protein, was also used as the quantitative information of the protein. The cut-off for differentially regulated proteins was set as described in the previous study [31]. Briefly, the Gaussian distribution of the protein ratios was analyzed, and the values deviating from the mean of the normally distributed data by 1.96 standard deviations (SD) were considered as the cut-off values. Regulated proteins were divided into three categories: category A: proteins with ratios greater than the upregulated or lesser than the downregulated cut-off values and a p-value for a protein ratio of <0.05, and these proteins are high confidence regulated proteins; category B: proteins with ratios greater than the upregulated or lesser than the downregulated cut-off values in at least two independent replicates; category C: for proteins only quantified in one replicate, the ratios should be greater than the upregulated or lesser than the downregulated cut-off values, and these are low confidence regulated proteins.",
