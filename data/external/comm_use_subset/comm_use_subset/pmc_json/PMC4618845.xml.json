Beginning with a case in Guinea in December 2013 [1], the outbreak extended to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Senegal [2]. Activities, such as early diagnosis, patient isolation and care, contact tracing, infection control practices, and safe burials, are recommended strategies to reduce transmission and control the epidemic [3] and have been implemented in the affected countries. Although there have been reports citing evidence for a decrease in transmission of Ebola virus after the implementation of prevention and response measures [4\u20136], the precise time when control of an epidemic has been achieved is difficult to determine during the course of the epidemic. A degree of control has been achieved when, on average, one infectious case does not produce another infectious case. That is, the disease has become subcritical and can no longer sustain itself in the population [7].",

Time-varying estimates of the reproduction number R for the epidemics in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea were calculated using a stochastic hidden Markov model. To assess the ongoing weekly transmission potential of Ebola in the three most intensely affected countries, we analyzed a simple mathematical transmission model based on previously published simple models [11]. The model consists of SEIR-type state spaces with two sequential exposure classes with progression rates chosen to provide a gamma-distributed incubation period of 10 days with a shape parameter of 2 (to be consistent with a previous WHO model [2]). The model distinguishes diagnosed from undiagnosed (and unknown) infectious cases with undiagnosed cases becoming diagnosed at a given rate. The transmission rates for undiagnosed and diagnosed cases are assumed to be different with diagnosed cases having a lower transmission rate due to case recognition and implementation of control measures. The number of confirmed cases is a counting process and is represented by a component of the state vector. Specifically, the states of the model are (1) uninfected individuals, (2, 3) latent or exposed individuals (infected, but who have not shown symptoms yet), (4) undiagnosed cases, (5) diagnosed cases, (6) removed individuals (died or recovered), and (7) confirmed cases. A full specification of the model is given in the S1 Appendix.",

The model is simulated as a continuous-time Markov chain. Based on the state of the system at the beginning of any given week (X\n(t)), the model is projected forward with the SEIR model, yielding the state at the end of the week X\n(t+1). The number of new confirmed cases predicted by the model is computed for that week (see S1 Appendix for details). This procedure is repeated n times, yielding a simulation-based estimate of the number C^t of new cases predicted, given the state and parameter values. We use a simple nonlinear particle filtering method to fit the simulated results to the WHO data (similar to the basic particle filter but using the resample/move method to prevent particle diversity depletion [12]). A Monte Carlo likelihood of the observed data given parameter values is calculated according to a Poisson distribution with C^t as the rate parameter. An alternate likelihood was derived by directly estimating the probability that the simulated number of confirmed cases exactly matched the observed number (the relative frequency of exact matches in the number of replications, listed as Bernoulli in the table in the S1 Appendix). This procedure, in turn, is repeated for each of P particles, consisting of state and parameter values. Each particle yields a Monte Carlo likelihood L\nj,t of the observed data given a set of parameters at time t. Importance resampling is then used, wherein the particles are resampled with weight wj,t=Lj,t/\u2211j\u2032Lj\u2032,t [13, 14] to choose the parameter values that most likely fit the data. To prevent depletion of particle diversity over time due to successive resampling, the resample/move method [15] is used. After resampling, the parameter values for each particle are perturbed using a symmetric transition kernel. Then, the original values of X\n(t) for that particle are used and the projection recomputed with new particles, leading to a new value for the Monte Carlo likelihood, L'. The perturbed values are accepted with probability r = min(1,L\u2032/L) (i.e., a single step of the Metropolis algorithm). The procedure is iteratively repeated at each time point. Once a fitted set of parameters are obtained, an estimated R can be calculated (see below).",

            "text": "Previous authors have observed the non-identifiability of specific parameter sets for the Ebola process [16, 17], and our model is not identifiable either. We assign values for all parameters except for the transmission coefficient \u03b2, and conduct the fitting algorithm (see Shaman [18]). Of particular importance is the fraction of unconfirmed cases since an arbitrarily changing pattern of incomplete reporting is indistinguishable from changes in transmission. Note that if transmission increases or decreases over time, the resample/move procedure introduces perturbations in the parameters and provides the ability to track changes dynamically. Given the parameter choices, we then compute the instantaneous reproduction number (R) implied by the model, which for our simple model, is given by\nR=\u03b2(1\u03bc+\u03c1+\u03c3+\u03ba\u03bc+\u03c1)\nwhere \u03ba is the relative infectivity of diagnosed cases, \u03bc is the mortality rate, \u03c1 is the recovery rate, \u03c3 is the diagnosis rate, and \u03b2 is a transmission coefficient. More generally, we should estimate the effective reproductive number by multiplying this quantity by the fraction of the population who are susceptible. However, by assumption, in this model, all immune individuals are former cases, and yet the cumulative incidence is small compared to the total population of each country, and we assume the susceptible fraction is essentially 1. Thus, assessment of control using this estimated R is somewhat pessimistic, since it is quite possible for the effective reproduction number to be less than one while our estimated R >1.",

As the number of cases declined and the concerns of its implications for vaccine studies grew [20], our results showed that the latest median estimate of R for Liberia was less than 1.0 with the last confirmed case reported during the week ending March 22, 2015 in the patient database. Similarly, the estimates of R for Sierra Leone may be declining as of late June 2015. Interventions and response efforts to control the disease must continue to make the epidemic subcritical in the two affected countries with reported cases, despite previous observations that transmission may be decreasing. However, we recognize that epidemic outcomes depend on individual behaviors as well as hospital capacities to care for sick, infectious, and dying individuals [21]; a multi-faceted control approach is most certainly warranted [22].",

A three-month ensemble forecast produced estimates of the basic reproduction number between 1.5 and 2.0 using data from July 6, 2014 to August 9, 2014 and a stochastic, individual-based model that provided estimates for the local transmission of Ebola virus [23]. Using a set of ordinary differential equations, basic reproduction numbers were estimated to be 1.6 for Liberia, 2.5 for Sierra Leone, and 1.5 for Guinea using data as of August 20, 2014 [24], which are consistent with other R\n0 estimates between 1.6 and 2.0 for the same time period [25]. With control measures, the effective reproductive number dropped to around 1.0 in Guinea and Sierra Leone by the end of May and July 2014, respectively using different methods. In Liberia, the effective reproductive number remained unchanged suggesting that there was no evidence of outbreak control during the same period of time [24]. Subsequently, the WHO Ebola Response Team estimated the basic reproduction numbers as 1.8 for Liberia, 2.0 for Sierra Leone, and 1.7 for Guinea using data as of September 14, 2014 [2]. Using data from July to September, 2014, the average number of secondary infections per infected individual was estimated to be 1.73, with survivors having a different estimate in comparison with non-survivors (0.66 and 2.36 respectively) in Montserrado County, Liberia [26]. Additional effective R estimates for the same time period ranged from 1.3 to 2.7 among the three west African countries [27].",

Using different methods, our results suggest that R became subcritical in Liberia in late October 2014. In Sierra Leone, R became subcritical in late January to early February 2015, confirming a previous R estimate [19]. Driving R to be less than 1.0 would certainly control the epidemic, but epidemics often fade out stochastically even when R is approximately 1.0 [28]. In order to control the epidemic, a combined approach involving different control strategies (i.e., case isolation, contact-tracing with quarantine, and safe funeral and burial practices) must be implemented [22]. It is not possible, however, to disentangle changes in reporting from changes in transmission. We also note that the wide credible limits on the reproduction number seen near the end of the time series may reflect, in part, low power resulting from small case counts.",

If the last few weeks of data change retrospectively due to reporting delays, i.e., more cases are added to the last few weeks of the closing date of the data, our estimates of R during this time period will change. An important limitation of the simple model we have chosen is that geographic heterogeneity has not been explicitly represented; ongoing transmission in specific regions or \u201chot spots\u201d could be occurring even though the basic reproduction number estimated from a simple homogeneous model is less than 1.0. Further work is therefore needed to include the effects of geographic heterogeneity as has been published previously [30, 31], including an assessment of the time to complete elimination. Also, our model also does not account for clustered transmission as has been noted to occur [32] or account for the effects of ring vaccination [33].",
