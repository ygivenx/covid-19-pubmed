            "text": "Lumpy Skin Disease virus (LSDV) is in the genus Capripoxvirus and family Poxviridae and is the causal agent of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), a transmissible disease of cattle with significant economic implications (1, 2). The disease is characterized by large skin nodules covering the entire body of the animal, emaciation, poor milk production, and abortion. The severity of the clinical symptoms varies from acute to subclinical forms (1\u20133). Due to its observed economic impacts on the global cattle industry (4, 5), the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) has classified LSDV as a notifiable disease. LSDV is mainly transmitted via arthropod vectors. LSDV outbreaks are typically associated with wet and warm seasons (6) and mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti are efficient mechanical vector for the transmission and maintenance of LSDV (7). Direct and indirect contact between infected and susceptible animals is not considered to be a pathway for transmission (8). The virus can infect other small ruminants such as sheep and goats, but does not cause clinical disease (9, 10). However, contact of cattle herds with sheep and goat in grazing/watering areas has been implicated as a potential risk factor for mechanical transmission of LSDV (11).",

            "text": "Clinical cases consistent with LSDV were first observed in northern Zambia in 1929 (12). In the 1940s, the disease rapidly spread to cattle populations of other southern African countries (5). Until 1984, LSDV was maintained within the countries of sub-Sahara Africa, where its pathogenicity increased over time leading to severe pandemics (5, 13). In the Middle East (ME), unconfirmed cases of the disease were reported in Oman and Kuwait between 1984 and 1988 (14\u201316). However, the first confirmed LSDV cases within ME countries were reported in Egypt in 1988 (15). In 1989, the first confirmed transcontinental spread of LSDV from African to Asian ME countries occurred when the disease was reported in Israel (17). This transcontinental spread of LSDV was attributed to wind-borne transmission via stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans) from Egypt (17). During the same year, suspected cases of LSDV were also reported in Saudi Arabia in a herd of Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) (18). Further outbreaks were also reported in Kuwait, Bahrain, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, and Sudan (15, 16, 18, 19). LSDV was reintroduced into Egypt via imported cattle from the African horn countries in 2006 (5, 20). Subsequently, LSDV cases were again reported in Israel, Bahrain, Oman, and the West Bank (20). For the first time, confirmed cases of LSDV were reported in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey between 2012 and 2013 (21). The Syrian Arab Republic has been implicated in the introduction of LSDV into Turkey (20). Due to the current armed conflict, the disease is believed to be underreported in Syria. This situation has raised major concerns in the international community, as the disease may spread into LSDV-free European member state countries using Turkey as a portal of introduction (22). Most recently, new cases of LSDV have been reported in Iran, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Greece, and Cyprus between 2014 and 2015 (19, 23, 24).",

Modeling the temporal and spatial dynamics of LSDV will provide a robust platform for guiding the design of infectious disease surveillance systems in the ME, and subsequently improve control and prevention. Furthermore, such knowledge will shed further insights into the epidemiology of LSDV in the ME and assess the risk of introduction into disease-free countries like the European Union member states.",

Here, we tested whether environmental and demographic variables can predict the geographic distribution of recent LSDV outbreaks reported in cattle populations of the ME for the period 2012\u20132015 using a presence-only maximum entropy ecological niche modeling method (Maxent). Furthermore, we estimated multiple effective reproductive numbers to assess transmission potential and efficacy of control and prevention measures during the course of the epidemic in the region. Results of such methodologies may shed further insights into the spatial and temporal epidemiology of LSDV in the ME.

The Maxent program version 3.3.3 was implemented as a function in Dismo package in R. A detailed description of the Maxent algorithm is available elsewhere (38). Briefly, Maxent builds ecological niche models by extracting associations between presence data (e.g., LSDV outbreaks) and environmental variables, using those associations to characterize the environmental requirements for the disease agent, and subsequently deploying those associations to predict suitable geographical locations in non-sampled areas. In this study, we used the default convergence threshold, regularization, and number of iterations. In addition, we used the default logistic model to ensure that predictions gave estimates between 0 and 1 for the risk of outbreak per map cell. Initially, we fitted separate Maxent models for each of the climatic variables and their association with LSDV outbreaks, a procedure that resembles a bivariate analysis. We then selected variables that had greater than 10% relative contribution in the prediction (improvement in predictive power relative to a null model) and included them in the subsequent multivariable models, along with the above non-climatic demographic variables. Cattle density was used as an indirect estimate of the distribution of the population at risk, which we included as background sampling data, while other environmental variables were included as direct predictors for the risk of LSDV (39). We set the Maxent program to randomly sample 10,000 locations within the ME to form background data (i.e., weights) for LSDV outbreaks in cattle. The established background data do not attempt to guess at the absence of LSDV locations (i.e., negative LSDV locations) but rather characterizes the nature of the cattle density distribution in the ME. In this sense, the background data establish the environmental domain of the study region, while LSDV outbreak presence data establish under which conditions an outbreak is more likely to be present than on average.",

We used k-fold method as a partitioning scheme (40), which randomly samples the data with replacement and creates k partitions, where each candidate Maxent model was tested five times (k = 5 in this study) against 1000 randomly generated background points (pseudo-absences). For the threshold independent method, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) through a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plot of the sensitivity (the proportion of true predicted known presences, known as omission error) vs. 1 \u2013 specificity (proportion of false predicted known absences, known as commission error) over the whole range of threshold values between 0 and 1. The training set (training AUC) was used for model building, and the test set (testing AUC) was used to evaluate model accuracy using the value of the AUC. The AUC value ranges from 0.5 (entirely random predictive model) to a maximum value of 1 (perfectly discriminating predictive model). Maxent models with AUC >0.75 for both training and testing data are usually considered accurate (41). We used the jackknife tests to calculate the contribution of each environmental variable to the final model\u2019s prediction. Because of the large geographic area analyzed in this study, we used a calibrated AUC (cAUC) for the final Maxent model to evaluate the presence of the spatial sorting bias (SSB) as suggested elsewhere (42). If the cAUC value was close to 1, then one can conclude the absence of SSB (i.e., countries with high reported outbreak incidences have small impact on the resulted Maxent model), whereas if the value was close to zero, then SSB is present in the data (i.e., countries with high reported outbreak incidences have large impact on the resulted Maxent model). cAUC is commonly smaller than training or testing AUCs because it uses a randomly selected smaller subset of the presence data (42).",

We compared the magnitude of change in the AUC values described above to further assess the sensitivity of the Maxent model to the reporting bias in the presence data (38, 39, 41, 42). We used the same approach to inspect for confounding of one environmental variable to another in the each ecological niche model by removing variables that contribute more than 10% in the prediction of probability for the spatial distribution of LSDV. Thus, if the AUC values changed by more than 5%, it would indicate that the variable is an important confounding factor. Finally, we tested the adequacy of the risk map generated by model II (Maxent model predicted by the observed Israeli outbreaks) in predicting the spatial distribution of LSDV in Turkey (i.e., predicted probabilities based on the observed outbreaks reported in Turkey). Hence, we created a \u201cvalidation Maxent\u201d model that compromised of the observed Turkish outbreaks, as independent presence-only data, and the risk map generated by Model II (Israeli Maxent model) as a single predictor to test whether the AUC values (training and testing AUC values) were less than 0.75.

High-risk areas (probability >0.6) for all Maxent models (Models I\u2013IV, Figures 3A\u2013D) were consistently identified in northern and central Israel, Cyprus, Lebanon, northwest Syria, the southern border of Turkey, and northern Iraq.

However, substantial discrepancies were observed in the identified risk areas between Maxent models I\u2013III and Maxent Model IV. Unlike the first three Maxent models (Models I\u2013III, Figures 3A\u2013C), Maxent Model IV identified the eastern Iraq and western Iran as high risk-areas (probability >0.6) for LSDV outbreaks (Figure 3D).

During the course of the current epidemic, the highest reported incidence of LSDV outbreaks was observed in Turkey and Israel (including the West Bank), and therefore, both countries were predicted as the highest risk areas for the disease (Figure 3). By using Maxent models to understand environmental factors underpinning high-risk areas, our results predict that high-risk areas also occur in northeastern and northwestern Syria, Cyprus, Lebanon, and the whole northern region of Iraq based on sharing similar environmental characteristics with areas of high reported incidence (Figure 3A). These high-risk areas have conditions suitable for transmission and circulation of LSDV in cattle populations, even if LSDV has not yet been reported. Hence, our results suggest that the identified geographic regions or countries with few reported LSDV outbreaks are still at high risk. Our AUC values suggest that the selected environmental variables of our ecological niche modeling approach were adequate predictors for the LSDV outbreaks in cattle in the ME between 2012 and 2015 (Table 2).",

These findings agree with past LSDV studies in Ethiopia, in which the characteristics of cattle farms, grazing system, and land cover features were important risk factors for LSDV in the country (4, 11, 28, 46). Furthermore, cattle farms with close geographic proximity to urban areas are quite common in ME countries including countries of the Arabian Peninsula, where severe LSDV outbreaks were recently reported (24, 45). This could be attributed to multiple risk factors including: favorable climatic conditions for vectors, low biosecurity measures, introduction of new animals and mixing of different livestock species, as suggested elsewhere (5, 13, 20, 26). In addition, cattle farms with close proximity to urban areas are under intensive human surveillance, and thus the number of detected outbreaks is expected to be higher than non-urban production systems.",

Furthermore, small-scale farms with mixed livestock species are also common in ME countries (26). Frequent contact of cattle herds with small nomadic sheep and goat herds has been considered as a risk factor for the transmission of LSDV, as described elsewhere (11, 46).

Indeed, this is expected due the diverse nature of each environmental predictor in each country or geographical areas within the ME. For example, Maxent model II suggested that the combination of land cover and livestock production system represented by proximity to croplands and mixed rain-fed arid livestock production areas, respectively, constituted ideal environments for the spread and maintenance of LSDV during wet seasons in Israel and other counties with similar environmental conditions. However, model III strongly suggested that climate and densities of sheep and goat populations played significant roles in the spread and maintenance of LSDV in Turkey and countries with similar environmental conditions (Table 2), which explains the expansion of the high-risk areas across that country (Figures 3A,C). Finally, the complex combination of climatic conditions, livestock densities, land cover, and production system features played a significant role in the transmission and spread of LSDV in the Egyptian Nile valley, eastern and central Iraq, and western Iran (Figure 3D).",

When using such approaches to infer spatial patterns of infection risk, it is important to remember that there is no single \u201ctrue\u201d model predicting risk across all contexts. Indeed, environmental factors contributing to risk may differ across space and time. However, our approach of using multiple input datasets both acknowledges that results may differ according to the input dataset and also allows for the identification of spatial and environmental patterns that are consistent regardless of the input dataset. This provides a robust way to address issues emerging from reporting biases across countries.",

Furthermore, estimates of the R-TD before September 2013 were on average larger than those estimated after that month (Figure 5). Although severe outbreaks were reported after September 2013, this is most likely attributed to the continuous increase in the political instability of the region after the Arab Spring. Thus, apparent reductions in numbers of outbreaks may be due to substantial underreporting rather than successful implementation of control measures, with the exception of Israel. Underreporting of cases and lack of information on the time of implementation of control measures might substantially bias the estimates of the effective R-TD, which is a major limitation described elsewhere (43). We believe that the largest R-TD estimated for the epidemic in Israel is indicative of a super-spreading event that occurred during that period. Following this, Israel rigorously implemented control activities, including a massive national vaccination campaign implement in 2013 (47), which led to the sharp drop in R-TD in the following month. Our study confirms that the demographic and environmental characteristics of Israel made it a suitable geographic area for super-spreading events of LSDV (inferred by large R-TD values), and the sharp drop of R-TD after its initial spike may reflect that their strong veterinary infrastructure and the 2013 vaccination campaign had successfully controlled this severe outbreak (47). Similar conclusions can be inferred in Turkey, where a large number of outbreaks were also reported after September 2013. Indeed, despite being environmentally suitable for LSDV, Turkey\u2019s low R-TDs could be attributed to effective control and prevention measures (24).",

For example, it has been shown that reporting bias has implications for the selection of a representative ecological niche model (42). In this study, reporting bias had a significant role in the discrepancies between the four Maxent models in terms of the distribution of spatial risk (Figure 3) and relative contribution of each environmental predictor (Table 2). Although reporting of LSDV is mandatory for OIE-member countries, this mandate does not necessarily imply that every case or outbreak has been reported, arguably, because of substantial difference in the surveillance capabilities between different ME countries. For that reason, outbreak data used in our study may have been biased toward countries with higher surveillance capabilities, leading to predictions skewed toward these countries, as in the case of Israel and Turkey. To address this, we also constructed a Maxent model that excluded data from high-reporting regions (Turkey, Isreal, and the West Bank). A visual inspection of Figures 3A\u2013D (model excluding data from high-reporting regions) reveals that the distribution of high-risk areas are similarly predicted by models built with or without data from high-reporting countries, though the absolute magnitude of risk differs somewhat. This gives us confidence that the overall Maxent model and predicted risk distributions are not skewed toward high-reporting countries.",

Despite the paucity of data from Syria, our analysis confirms that areas within Syria are suitable for the spread of LSDV (Figures 3A\u2013D). Furthermore, our rigorous validation methods, including the use of the Israeli risk map to directly and independently predict the risk of LSDV in Turkey, indicated that the Israeli model is an accurate predictor of risk outside Isreal\u2019s borders (Figure 4).

            "text": "Although, our identified environmental predictors match those identified in the past published literature, as described above, the resulting risk maps for LSDV occurrence are not definitive and need to be updated periodically as new data emerges. Thus, in the event of future epidemics, these analyses need to be repeated and refined in order to be subsequently used in surveillance, control, and prevention strategies. Furthermore, the model predictions suggest that the reason why some ME countries did not report cases of LSDV might not be due to underreporting, but simply because they did not exhibit suitable environmental conditions for the spread of LSDV in cattle. Therefore, an additional use of ecological modeling here may be to distinguish between geographic areas in which absence of reporting was likely due to a true absence of disease and those in which disease may be underreported but present. It is important to note that our analytical approach neither attempts to predict future epidemics, in terms of where and when the next LSDV outbreak will likely occur, nor provide definitive risk estimates for the introduction or occurrence of the outbreaks. Instead, our inferences are mainly useful in providing further insights into the current epidemiological situation of LSDV in the ME based on available data. Such knowledge might be useful in guiding the design of risk-based surveillance activities, in which sampling schemes can be targeted toward high-risk geographical areas and periods of time, identified by our analytical approach, and accordingly mobilize control, and prevention resources for the current LSDV epidemic.",

We inferred significant epidemic transmission patterns in time for LSDV, and identified environmental factors that shape the ecological niche of the disease in cattle in the ME between 2012 and 2015. Furthermore, most of the significant R-TDs (>1), which have reached up to 22.2-fold increase, indicated that the identified environmental conditions in Israel and the Palestinian territories were conducive for region-level super-spreading events of LSDV outbreaks and that Isreal\u2019s 2013 vaccination campaign was indeed successful in controlling the disease. While our results identified areas in which underreporting of LSDV outbreaks may have occurred, they also suggest that more epidemiological information related to cattle populations is needed to further improve the inferred spatial and temporal characteristics of currently circulating LSDV. However, the methodology presented here may contribute to the formulation of risk-based surveillance programs, with targeted sampling schemes, that selectively target high-risk cattle areas with specific demographic and environmental factors in the ME region and guide epidemic preparedness efforts in neighboring LSDV-free countries.",
