The broad-scale drivers of the apparent increase in the number of emerging diseases are well documented, involving such factors as climate change, environmental disruption, an increasingly centralized agricultural system and rapid global transportation, as well as high densities of humans, animals and crops. Combined, these factors have created new opportunities for viruses and other pathogens to change their host range and cause epidemic disease. In humans, this confluence of factors has led to the emergence of a number of high-profile viral infections over the last 40 years, including the ongoing global epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pandemic influenza A viruses such as H1N1/09, SARS coronavirus (CoV), MERS-CoV, and the more recent outbreaks of Ebola virus in West Africa and Zika virus throughout the Americas.",

In particular, there is now a large body of literature devoted to understanding the determinants of disease emergence, with a strong focus on emerging viruses. This work has the implicit and commendable goal of trying to reveal the overarching rules of disease emergence, which in turn might lead to predictions of what virus might emerge next and where this may occur [5\u20138]. Gaining this sort of predictive capability would have obvious and wide-ranging benefits. In these approaches, the study of virus emergence is often synonymous with the study of virus evolution, such that the more we understand about the patterns and processes of evolutionary change, the more accurate any emergence prediction is thought to be.",

We show here that a more meaningful understanding of virus emergence requires us to shift the focus away from the broader processes of virus evolution and towards the short-term factors that influence the probability of the successful establishment of a virus in a host population. In other words, if the goal is to develop a meaningful predictive model of disease emergence, there may be considerable value in tuning out the background \u2018noise\u2019 of virus evolution rather than building the model around long-term evolutionary processes. More fundamentally, we will argue that a more practical approach to the challenge of virus emergence will involve abandoning prediction in favour of genomic surveillance at the ecological \u2018fault-lines\u2019 of emergence.",

            "text": "The successful emergence of a virus in a new host will often entail a significant adaptive challenge. Indeed, one of the most important observations in disease emergence is that not all viruses that jump species boundaries successfully evolve onward transmission in the new host. Rather, many such viruses appear as transient \u2018spill-over\u2019 infections that soon die out, even in the absence of infection control. For example, despite repeated spill-over events from birds to humans, H5N1 avian influenza virus has not been able to evolve sustained human-to-human transmission [9]. Other viruses have been more successful and resulted in significant outbreaks in new hosts. For example, Ebola virus (EBOV) has caused several localized epidemics that have been largely restricted in their spread by administrative boundaries and border closings [10]. Hence, although there is evidence of the active adaptation of EBOV to humans during the recent 2013\u20132016 outbreak in West Africa [11,12], the virus clearly possesses the base-line virological traits needed to ensure its onward transmission in the new host. Finally, some viruses have evolved to become endemic human pathogens, involving the generation of well-established and long-standing chains of transmission that do not require repeated spill-over events from an animal reservoir. An obvious case in point is HIV, the agent of AIDS, although a wide variety of human viruses fall into this class. Indeed, it is likely that most endemic virus infections in humans ultimately resulted from cross-species transmission, although in the majority of cases the exact animal reservoir species are unknown or unsampled. For example, although hepaciviruses are being increasingly documented in animal populations, it is likely that the true reservoir species for human hepatitis C virus has yet to be identified [13,14]. These different virus\u2013host associations, from spill-over to endemicity, highlight the two central questions in the evolution of virus emergence: (i) Why are only some viruses able to successfully spread in a new host? (ii) What barriers, both ecological and genetic, prevent active host adaptation from taking place?",

As expected, many mutations that promote successful host adaptation are concerned with aspects of virus-receptor binding [11,12,17], although changes in other traits, such as pH [18] and interactions with host antiviral responses [19,20], are also of importance. However, virus genetics alone cannot explain why only some emerging viruses are successful. Indeed, even viruses that appear to be well adapted to a specific host (i.e. that seemingly harbour all necessary host-specific mutations) may fail to spread.",

            "text": "An informative example concerns the recent emergence of the A/H3N8 subtype of canine influenza virus (CIV). Although this virus was first recorded in dogs in the USA in the early 2000s, with horses acting as the reservoir host [21], it has failed to become established in the domestic dog population. Instead, CIV is largely confined to dog shelters, where most dogs are infected soon after they arrive [22]. CIV clearly possesses all the genetic characteristics necessary to spread in dogs, and its reproductive number in dog shelters is always sufficient (i.e. R0 > 1) to allow its spread within these confined spaces. However, CIV has failed to ignite a wider epidemic in dogs, probably because contact heterogeneity in the domestic dog population is much greater than in dog shelters such that there is an insufficient density of susceptible hosts for the outbreak to take hold [22]. This inhibition of virus emergence through a lack of susceptible hosts is likely to be commonplace. The general lesson to be learned for exercises in prediction is that determining whether a virus can spread in a particular host, for example following cell passage experiments or using animal models, does not mean that it will in the real world unless epidemiological circumstances are permissive. Virus emergence should therefore always be thought of as a combination of successful genetics aligned with permissive ecology [4,8,16].",

At the virus genetic level, there has been effort to determine those virological factors that correlate with transmissibility within a specific host [7] (see below). Theoretical studies aimed at assessing the predictability of emergence have strived to encompass the complexities of inter- and intra-host evolutionary fitness dynamics [2,24\u201326], where the within-host and between-host fitness landscapes play a central role in determining the probability of emergence [4,24].",

Through a global partnership the GVP aims to identify and characterize 99% of zoonotic viruses with epidemic potential to better predict, prevent and respond to future viral threats [27]. To achieve these aims, the GVP will perform large-scale metagenomic surveys of viruses in vertebrate populations. The underlying logic is that knowing what viruses are present in nature provides substantive value in trying to determine what will come next. The GVP is therefore the clarion call for studies in predicting virus emergence.",

This impracticality is augmented when one considers our lack of knowledge of whether this vast set of viruses can replicate in human cells, and even this trait will not guarantee that a virus will be able to successfully transmit between hosts. In this context it has been proposed that machine learning may help in pandemic prediction, for instance by using sequence data to predict which cell receptors a virus might use [35,36]. However, attaining knowledge of cell receptor compatibility in itself does not enable accurate predictions of emergence, particularly as viruses with a diverse range of receptors are able to infect humans. For example, it has long been known that influenza viruses bind to sialic acid-containing molecules as receptors [37]. However, this information has not improved prediction of influenza virus emergence and re-emergence. More generally, machine learning requires very large amounts of data to predict common events, whereas studies of disease emergence necessarily use data on rare events to predict rare events.",

This was first developed as a framework to infer the dynamics of tick-borne Lyme disease, and describes the association between increasing species richness and reduced disease risk, particularly when the most competent hosts were dominant in the community and alternative hosts negatively influenced the dominant hosts as reservoirs [43,48]. Although still debated, the dilution effect highlights the central role of host biodiversity and ecology in shaping the epidemiology of disease-causing pathogens. Inevitably, habitat destruction and ecosystem disturbance due to changes in land use will contribute to the loss of biodiversity.

There are clearly so many viruses in nature that trying to determine which will ultimately appear in a new host from diversity sampling alone is almost certainly futile.",

However, a major limitation is that evolutionary processes, particularly those reliant on phylogenetic or other comparative analyses, often occur on a markedly different time scale than the epidemiological processes relevant to pandemic prediction. Indeed, one of the most important conclusions of recent work in the study of RNA virus evolution is that the time scale over which these viruses have evolved, including cross-species transmission events, is probably far longer than previously imagined. This realization comes from both phylogenetic studies of virus biodiversity and branching patterns [49,52], particularly the match between parts of the virus and host trees, and the analyses of endogenous virus elements that act as genomic fossils [53]. Hence, it is likely that many of the viral families that infect vertebrates have done so for many millions of years, and have experienced continual cross-species transmission since this time.",

These taxonomic ranges may have taken millions of years to generate and not the scale of years necessary for effective pandemic prediction. Evolutionary and epidemiological time scales should not simply be assumed to be equivalent. Although phylogenies can be used to accurately describe both macro- and micro-evolution, and superficially appear similar, the trees at these two scales are produced by markedly different evolutionary processes (figure 3).

There is strong evidence for hepadnavirus\u2013host co-divergence stretching back for effectively the entire time-span of vertebrate evolution [52,54]. Cross-species transmission has occurred on this background of co-divergence, with a recent analysis revealing approximately 13 host jumps over an evolutionary period of approximately 400 million years [49]. Although our sample of hepadnaviruses is inevitably small, with new hepadnaviruses recently identified in fish [54], and more cases of cross-species transmission will assuredly be found, this very roughly equates to a successful cross-species transmission event every 30 million years. Even if the rate of host jumping is 10 000 times more frequent, occurring once every 3000 years, this is still far too broad a time scale to provide any meaningful predictive value for the study of human disease emergence. A similar story can be told for the influenza viruses. Although these are exemplars of cross-species transmission [55], which occurs frequently in the Orthomyxoviridae [49], it is still problematic to make these predictions over the time scale of human observation. For example, the emergence of H3N8 equine influenza virus from an avian host took place in the early 1960s. Although this virus is clearly adapted for mammalian respiratory transmission, there is no evidence that it has transmitted to humans during the last 50 years.",

Although they may be of myriad form, the ecological factors that dictate whether such an emergence event will be successful are directly analogous to the random sampling effects that necessarily impact the spread of any new allele in a population, increasing the likelihood of genetic drift that will in turn result in stochastic loss. For example, the extensive contact heterogeneity (i.e. lack of susceptible hosts) that prevents CIV spreading in the domestic dog population is equivalent to the fate of an advantageous allele in a small host population. That is, although the virus (mutation) may be host-adapted (advantageous), it will not spread far because the host population is so small/sparse that genetic drift dominates substitution dynamics (and even strongly advantageous alleles may be lost rather than fixed in small populations).",

A well-understood framework is that successful cross-species transmission requires three steps: (i) encounter a new host species, (ii) infection of that new host and (iii) propagation in the new host population [57]. Adaptation to the new host species may often represent a major challenge, as mutations that are beneficial in this host also probably decrease fitness in the reservoir host species. This opposing selection between reservoir and recipient hosts shapes the adaptive landscape of viral emergence [24]. For example, as the gradient of the adaptive landscape increases, genetic variants are subjected to stronger opposing selection between the reservoir and the recipient hosts. Models of this adaptive process therefore offer an indication of in which part of parameter space the host adaptation of a novel virus might be possible [2,4,24,26].",

In addition, while metagenomics is hugely powerful in characterizing the viromes of individual organisms, including the discovery of new species, it requires active infection (replication) and that samples be taken from tissues that contain the virus. For this reason meta-serological surveys will also be of importance as they enable the identification of infections that have occurred in the recent past.",

The study of virus evolution has revealed much about the nature of virus emergence and its history over evolutionary time scales. However, due to the fundamental differences between evolutionary and epidemiological time scales, a focus on virus evolution may in fact be a distraction when it comes to predicting the next virus pandemic. Similarly, while virological features that increase the likelihood of virus emergibility can be identified, these features cannot be treated as hard and fast rules determining which viruses will successfully emerge. Further, many of these features are only capable of being observed after emergence occurs, such that they are likely to be of little predictive power. In partial response to these problems, we suggest that the field may be advanced by using a population genetic framework that melds genetic and ecological studies of virus emergence, and which highlights how the effective susceptible population size of a new host plays a major role in dictating the chance of successful emergence. In this manner we identify the possibility of a meaningful theoretical framework for the study of emergence that is grounded in evolutionary theory, but that tunes out the \u2018noise\u2019 of virus macroevolution.",

In light of this we suggest it may be of more benefit to public health to target, via surveillance, the fault-line of disease emergence that is the human\u2013animal interface, particularly those shaped by ecological disturbance. Once a virus is identified as being of interest in this manner, other analyses may be able to assess its impact and pandemic potential. Such a shift in focus, away from being able to make predictions of emergence based on fundamental rules and towards the better assessment of emergence impact, is both more achievable and more likely to provide positive public health outcomes.",
