After the 2009 pandemic, outbreaks of that strain have continued to cause serious illness and increased mortality, particularly in young adults and children [1]. The physiopathology of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) infection differs between individuals. Whilst most patients develop mild upper respiratory-tract infection [2], some patients progress to develop severe lower respiratory tract complications [3]. In addition, high rates of clinically unapparent infections have been reported by seroepidemiological studies [4, 5]. This evidence suggests that the severity of influenza is, at least, partially determined by host factors.",

Several hypotheses have been made about the mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of the host inflammatory response after pH1N1 and IAV infection.

[9] showed that lethality in a murine model of acute influenza arose directly from the damage caused by constrained innate inflammation primarily involving neutrophils co-acting with monocytes. However, the first influx of neutrophiles and monocytes needs to be induced by the release of innate immune mediators from lung resident cell populations (respiratory epithelium, endothelium and alveolar macrophages), which first come in contact with the virus.",

Although cytokines have specific functions and are released in a cell-type-dependent manner, all of them are produced/activated via common mechanisms involving the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [20, 21]. By these means, several studies have implicated either lung endothelial or epithelial cells as key regulators in the initial release of pro-inflammatory cytokines after pH1N1 infection [10, 14, 16]. However, their relative contribution to cytokine release regulation mechanisms and the dynamics of their release have not entirely been elucidated.",

In this way, the modulation of the host immune response will have the potential advantage of exerting less selective pressure on viral populations, an important factor in the development of IAV infection therapies. With the aim to unravel the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the innate immune response against IAV infection, and the relative contribution of the different lung compartments, we investigated the early induction of innate immune molecules, observed in different lung compartments. We tried to discern the cytokine production of the main cell type present in each lung compartment (endothelial cells, epithelial bronchiolar cells and alveolar epithelial cells) by means of a laser capture microdissection (LCM) technique. As the limitations of the technique did not allow us to completely individualize the target cells, we assessed the cytokine expression associated to the viral replication in the different lung compartments (vascular, alveolar and bronchiolar).",

Upon arrival at the Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA), the animals were placed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities. Ferrets were randomly assigned to different experimental groups, separated into experimental isolation rooms and then acclimated during 1 week. The animals were inhabited in standard housing cages for laboratory ferrets (F-SUITE Ferret Housing, Tecniplast, Italy) and they were provided with commercial food pellets and tap water ad libitum throughout the experiment. All experiments were performed under a protocol (no. 1976) that was reviewed and approved by the Animal and Human Experimentation Ethics Commission of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona. Animals were divided into two groups. The control group included two ferrets and the infected group included nine ferrets which were intratracheally inoculated with 105 TCID50/mL of the A/CastillaLaMancha/RR5911/2009 virus diluted in 0.5 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS). During inoculation, animals were deep sedated with butorphanol (0.05 mg/kg) (Torbugesic\u00ae Vet, S.A., Spain) and medetomidine (0.05 mg/kg) (Domtor\u00ae Pfizer, S.A., Spain) administered subcutaneously. After inoculation, animals were reverted from sedation with atipamezole (0.25 mg/kg) subcutaneously administered and monitored by a specialized veterinarian until complete recovering from sedation. Control and infected animals were euthanized at 0 and 12, 24 and 72 h post infection (hpi) respectively. Early times post infection were selected in order to evaluate the innate immune response and assess early immune viral recognition and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines throughout infection. Animals were euthanized by an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), under anaesthesia with ketamine (5\u201310 mg/kg) (Imalgene 1000\u00ae Merial, S.A., Spain) and medetomidine (0.05 mg/kg) (Domtor\u00ae Pfizer, S.A., Spain), administered subcutaneously.

These findings were expected, since the bronchiolar epithelium is one of the first targets after IAV infection [10, 28]. Later, more severe histopathological lesions were observed in correspondence with higher presence of leukocytes and the infection of alveolar epithelial cells. Concurrently, bronchiolar areas presented the higher expression of TNF\u03b1, CCL3, IL-8 and IFN\u03b3. Alveolar areas were also shown to contribute to the influx of inflammatory cells by the up-regulation of IFN\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8, at 12 hpi, and CCL3 and IFN\u03b3, at 24 hpi. The up-regulation of IL-8, IFN\u03b3 and CCL3 has been related to lung recruitment of neutrophils, NK and T cells and the development of severe influenza infection [8, 14, 19, 29]. In addition, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 up-regulation mediate phagocytic inflammatory infiltration and the apoptosis of infected cells [10, 30], which has also been associated with severe lung lesions after IAV [7, 11, 31]. Our results indicate that early infection of bronchiolar epithelial cells followed by alveolar epithelial cells are the primary source of inflammatory mediators and contribute to the severity of the lung lesion after IAV infection.",

Here, IFN\u03b1 was highly upregulated in bronchiolar areas in association with the presence of IAV antigen detected by IHC in bronchiolar epithelial cells. In contrast, the expression of this cytokine in alveolar areas was not as relevant as in the bronchiolar compartment, even though viral replication was extensive in the alveolar compartment at 24 hpi. This differential IFN\u03b1 expression observed in the lung compartments might reflect diverse intracellular signalling pathways in different cell types, with distinct physiological functions (bronchiolar epithelial cell versus pneumocyte). In that sense, the PRRs TLR3 and RIG-I were also up-regulated differently in the lung compartments studied, which may indicate that the different cell types recognise viral incursions and activate the release of cytokines through different signalling pathways.",

            "text": "In contrast to bronchiolar areas, vascular and alveolar areas presented a higher induction of TLR3 but did not show up-regulation of RIG-I at any time point. After IAV infection, TLR3 recognizes infected cells and induces an antiviral state that recruits damage-inducing inflammatory cells contributing to lung pathology [14]. Different studies reported that TLR3 up-regulation was associated with a higher induction of different pro-inflammatory molecules, such as CCL2, particularly in vascular areas [14]. The detrimental role of CCL2 in IAV pathogenesis was proven in a study where CCR2 deficient mice infected with IAV inhibited macrophage migration to the lungs, increasing survival rates [35, 37]. Other studies have also associated CCL2 upregulation with poorer outcomes of infection [10, 11, 38\u201340]. In our study, vascular areas showed most of CCL2 expression, particularly at 24 hpi, when leukocyte migration was most observed. In addition to CCL2, a higher up-regulation of IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 was also observed at 24 hpi in vascular areas, which expression has also been related with severe pathology after IAV infection [10]. These data establish a link between TLR3 signalling and the activation of endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells, leading to the release of different pro-inflammatory mediators, after IAV infection. In the present study, viral active replication was not observed in vascular areas and only low viral antigen was detected by IHC in alveolar areas at early stages of infection, when TLR3 was highly upregulated. TLR3 is expressed in the endosomal compartments of various cellular types, whose activation is mediated by the recognition of double stranded RNA (dsRNA), entered into the cell by endocytosis [20, 21, 41, 42]. Since dsRNA is a universal pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), it has been assumed that TLR3 would play a key role in antiviral immunity. However, it has been demonstrated that TLR3 also contributes to pulmonary damage through the induction of pro-inflammatory molecules and the recruitment of leukocytes, during IAV virus infection [7, 42\u201346]. Furthermore, TLR3 polymorphisms have been shown to be related to severe cases of influenza infection in humans and mice [42, 47, 48] and its upregulation has been associated with severe pulmonary lesions in the ferret model after IAV infection [42, 46\u201349]. Moreover, it is known that TLR3 signalling is not required for the initial cell-autonomous recognition of viral infection or the induction of IFN\u03b1, which is induced via viral recognition by RIG-I [50]. These data support the results observed in this study and suggests that viruses actively replicating in the cytoplasm are recognized by RIG-I, but not TLR3, irrespective of their route of entry [50]. Besides, it has been proved that influenza virus-infected cells do not generate dsRNA [51], due to the activity of the cellular RNA helicase UAP56 [52]. Therefore, we hypothesize that TLR3 may recognize unidentified RNA structures, from dying influenza virus-infected cells (cell-derived extracellular RNA or eRNA), or viral components from non-replicative viruses. Supporting this hypothesis, replication-deficient IAV, arisen from internal deletions of IAVs, significantly activated endothelial lung cells inducing a strong host cell response [52]. Besides, it has been recently proved, in vitro and in vivo, that various types of non-self eRNA can be sensed by recipient cells during infection, inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from recipient cells [17, 53\u201355].",

In addition, alveolar and vascular areas contributed to the induction of the pro-inflammatory innate immune response, through the activation of TLR3. In vascular areas, this activation was observed to be independent of active viral replication. We hypothesize that the innate immune response induced by vascular areas, may be consequence of signals triggered by the detection of viral RNA, or, through a complex crosstalk mechanism with the infected lung epithelium.",
