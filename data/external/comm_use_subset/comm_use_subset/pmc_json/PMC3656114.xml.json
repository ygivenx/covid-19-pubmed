Thus, human B cells are likely to comprise a very important compartment for the persistent KSHV infection.

            "text": "The replication and transcription activator (RTA) is a KSHV immediate early protein that activates a broad spectrum of lytic viral genes and thereby induces lytic reactivation. RTA can either directly bind to RTA-responsive elements or use cellular DNA binding factors like Ap-1, C/EBP-\u03b1, Oct-1 and CBF1/CSL as adaptors to DNA as reviewed [5]. The DNA binding factor CBF1/CSL (C-promoter binding factor, Suppressor of hairless, and Lag1 also designated CSL or RBP-J\u03ba) is a highly conserved ubiquitously expressed protein and the major effector of Notch receptor signaling. In the following we will use the term CBF1 for this protein. It can serve as adaptor for transactivators but also can recruit corepressor complexes and thereby silence gene expression [6], [7]. Two general experimental strategies focussing on the cellular interaction partner or the viral genome have been used to study the functional implications of the RTA-CBF1 interaction. Initially, infection and virus production of CBF1 proficient and deficient murine fibroblasts was studied in isogenic systems. These studies suggested lytic reactivation is blocked while establishment of latency is not impaired in cells lacking CBF1 [8], [9]. Alternatively, computational prediction of potential CBF1 binding sites in the viral genome was followed by biochemical and mutational analysis of the respective viral promoters in promoter reporter assays or in the context of the viral genome by recombinant virus technologies. In addition, activation of viral targets by activated Notch defined further sets of CBF1 dependent promoters. In summary, these studies convincingly showed, that CBF1 contributes to the activation of ORF6, ORF8, ORF19, ORF47, ORF50, ORF57, ORF59, ORF61, ORF70, K2, K5, K6, K8, K14 and PAN as well as the latency transcript cluster (summarized and referenced in Table 1). Importantly, these genes control multiple stages in the viral latent and lytic life cycle. The relevance of the contribution of CBF1 to target gene control varied among the individual genes that were studied. Thus, the question remained to which extent the activity of CBF1 contributes to the process of viral reactivation and virus production in human B cells.",

After infection of the lymphoblastoid B cell line BJAB with cell-associated recombinant virus and cultivation of these infected BJAB cells in selective medium stable latently infected cultures were generated.

To this end, we have infected isogenic CBF1 deficient and proficient human B cell lines with recombinant KSHV and compared them for viral reactivation and virus production. Our results indicate that viral reactivation is initiated in both CBF1 proficient and deficient B cells but viral gene expression is severely attenuated and virus production is below the detection level in the absence of CBF1. In addition to the viral genes already known to be controlled by CBF1, we could identify two further direct CBF1 dependent RTA target genes, ORF29a and ORF65.",

            "text": "In order to analyze the contribution of CBF1 to viral reactivation in KSHV infected B cells we used a CBF1 negative human somatic B cell line. This cell line had been generated previously by gene targeting of the cellular CBF1 gene in the EBV negative Burkitt's lymphoma B cell line DG75 [19]. For infection of CBF1 proficient parental (DG75 wt) and CBF1 deficient (DG75 CBF1 ko) DG75 cells we used cell culture supernatants of the recombinant virus rKSHV.219 produced in Vero cells. The recombinant virus rKSHV.219 is a derivative of the KSHV strain obtained from JSC-1 cells [20]. rKSHV.219 encodes for red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the control of a CBF1 independent fragment of the KSHV early lytic PAN promoter, constitutively expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP), and carries a puromycin resistance cassette as a selectable marker. DG75 wt and DG75 CBF1 ko cells were infected with rKSHV.219 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of factor 5. GFP expression was monitored by flow cytometry during a time course of 12 weeks. A GFP positive cell population could be detected 1 week post infection. The intensity of the GFP signals recorded by flow cytometry was initially weak but increased over time in both, CBF1 proficient and deficient B cell lines (Fig. 1A). The results suggest that stable homogenous KSHV infected B cell cultures are generated within 4\u20136 weeks post infection irrespective of the CBF1 status. High GFP expression remained stable as long as the cultures were maintained in media containing puromycin (Fig. 1A). If the established rKSHV.219 infected DG75 wt and DG75 CBF1 ko cell lines (K-DG75 wt and K-DG75 CBF1 ko) were cultivated in the absence of puromycin a GFP negative population developed. Only 30% of CBF1 proficient and 22% of CBF1 deficient B cells were still GFP positive after they had been cultivated in puromycin free media for 10 weeks (Fig. 1B). Hence, viral maintenance required selection in both B cell lines. Viral genome copy numbers of established K-DG75 wt and K-DG75 CBF1 ko cell lines were determined and compared to data obtained from two independent KSHV infected PEL cell lines, BCBL-1 and BC-1. As expected 50 to 60 intracellular genomes were detected in BCBL-1 and BC-1 cells [21], [22]. K-DG75 wt and CBF1 ko cells carried approximately 10 viral copies per cell (Fig. 1C). Both K-DG75 cell lines, CBF1 proficient and deficient, expressed the KSHV latent marker genes ORF73/LANA and K10.5/vIRF3 at similar levels (Fig. 1D). ORF73/LANA is consistently expressed in latently infected cells of different tissue origin and required to maintain episomal viral genomes during cell division [23]\u2013[25]. Latent expression of K10.5/vIRF3 is only seen in KSHV infected B cells [26]. The relative transcript levels of both viral genes were lower than in BCBL-1 and BC-1 cells but readily detectable. These distinct expression levels might partially reflect the lower viral genome copy numbers in the K-DG75 cell lines compared to BCBL-1 and BC-1.",

Upon treatment with sodium butyrate (NaB) the surrogate early lytic marker gene RFP was induced and expressed with similar frequencies in two independent K-DG75 wt and K-DG75 CBF1 ko cell lines (Fig. 2A). The combination of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and NaB further enhanced RFP expression with a negligible difference between wt and CBF1 ko cells (Fig. 2B). Initiation of lytic reactivation thus does not appear to be a CBF1 dependent process in these B cells. We next analyzed if CBF1 proficient and deficient K-DG75 cell lines exhibit similar rates of viral replication upon lytic reactivation by TPA/NaB treatment. The rate of dead cells was determined for treated and untreated cell populations by trypan blue exclusion assays. The TPA/NaB treatment caused similar rates of dead cells in both populations (Fig. S1A). Viable subpopulations were defined by forward and sideward scatter signals (Fig. S1B) and RFP+/GFP+ cells were separated from RFP\u2212/GFP+ cells by cell sorting. Equal numbers of sorted cells were compared for the number of intracellular viral genomes. Viral copy numbers increased in CBF1 proficient and deficient cells, but the increase in CBF1 proficient cells was two fold stronger (Fig. 2C).",

K-DG75 B cells were treated with TPA and NaB for 4 days, supernatants were harvested, concentrated 100-fold and used to infect HEK293 cells. These HEK293 cells were cultured either in the presence or absence of puromycin for 48 h and subsequently analyzed for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2D). In addition, cellular viability was monitored by flow cytometry using forward and sideward scatter to visualize viable and dead cell populations (Fig. 2E). GFP positive HEK293 cells were readily detected after infection with K-DG75 wt cell supernatants. K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells produced no or extremely low numbers of virions that conferred GFP expression. As a second marker for successful infection we tested whether the viral supernatants conferred puromycin resistance (Fig. 2D and E). Indeed, HEK293 cells infected with viral supernatants harvested from K-DG75 wt cells could be expanded in the presence of puromycin while HEK293 cells infected with supernatants from K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells lost their typical shape and their adherent phenotype and subsequently died (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that supernatants derived from CBF1 deficient K-DG75 cells contain no or only low amounts of infectious virus. To further confirm this assumption, extracellular viral genome copy numbers in K-DG75 wt and CBF1 ko derived supernatants were quantified and compared to virion DNA produced by BC-1. Virus production was induced \u223c165-fold upon chemical reactivation of K-DG75 wt cells, approximately 3-fold higher than in BC-1 cells. In contrast, virion production by CBF1 deficient cells was barely detectable (Fig. 2F). In summary, our data show that K-DG75 cells can produce infectious virus. Genome replication was attenuated in CBF1 deficient K-DG75 cells and later processes required for morphogenesis of infectious virus were blocked.",

ORF59 is one of the DNA polymerase processivity factors which are necessary for origin dependent viral replication [32]. Since ORF50/RTA induction was diminished in CBF1 deficient cells this defect in RTA expression could already cause a severe phenotype in CBF1 deficient DG75 cells. We hence wanted to ask if ORF50/RTA expression might rescue the deficiency of the CBF1 deficient K-DG75 cells. We thus expressed ORF50/RTA in K-DG75 cells and induced the lytic cycle by NaB. ORF50/RTA could strongly enhance ORF57 and ORF59 expression in NaB treated CBF1 proficient cells but induction in the absence of CBF1 was weak (Fig. 6).

Viral genes that had been previously defined as genes which need CBF1 to recruit either RTA or Notch are listed in Table 1. In order to identify additional CBF1 dependent viral target genes the promoters of 4 selected genes which carried at least one CBF1 binding site predicted by using the MatInspector software of Genomatix were analyzed. Since the transcriptional start site of these genes had not been defined experimentally in the past a fragment of 1000 bp upstream of the translational start site was tested as a putative promoter. Transactivation of these putative promoter fragments by ORF50/RTA was tested in transient reporter gene assays using KSHV negative DG75 cells. For comparison the promoter of ORF59, a well known CBF1 dependent target gene, was included in the analysis. All promoters responded to ORF50/RTA even in the absence of CBF1 in a dose dependent manner indicating that there is no absolute requirement for CBF1 to recruit RTA to these target genes and activate transcription. Promoter activation of ORF59, ORF29a and ORF65 was significantly diminished in CBF1 deficient DG75 cells while transactivation of the ORF9 and ORF62 promoters was not impaired (Fig. 7A). By reintroducing CBF1, transactivation of the ORF59, ORF29a and ORF65 promoters was strongly enhanced confirming that CBF1 is a rate limiting factor for efficient activation of these promoters (Fig. 7B). Since we wanted to prove that CBF1 is recruited to the promoters of ORF29a and ORF65 we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations followed by real-time PCR for viral promoter fragments (Fig. 7C). While CBF1 could be readily detected on the promoter of its cellular target gene CD23 in KSHV positive and negative DG75 wt cells, as expected CBF1 was seen on viral promoters in KSHV infected DG75 wt cells only. In summary, these results suggest that the promoters of ORF29a and ORF65 are directly bound by CBF1.",

Thus, CBF1 provides a central hub in every mammalian cell that is used by the cell to integrate information transmitted by external and internal stimuli. The two human \u03b3-herpesviruses, EBV and KSHV, use CBF1 as a DNA adaptor for viral nuclear transcription factors to control the activity of viral and cellular target genes. EBV requires the CBF1 protein to enter and maintain the latent life cycle. In contrast, lytic infection and reactivation are CBF1 dependent processes in KSHV infected cells [8], [9]. RTA, the initiator of viral lytic replication, can bind to DNA directly but also uses CBF1 as an adaptor to regulatory elements of target genes. RTA expression is controlled by CBF1 binding sites within the RTA promoter. Thereby RTA initiates a positive feed back loop driving lytic reactivation [33]. On the other hand, LANA expression is also controlled by RTA via CBF1 dependent activation while LANA represses RTA expression via binding to CBF1 at the RTA promoter. However, subsequent studies using infective recombinant KSHV which lacked CBF1 binding sites in the RTA promoter demonstrated that these viruses had an enhanced capacity to infect and establish latency in primary human B cells in short term experiments [33]. In summary, CBF1 serves as the mediator of a negative and positive feed back loop that balances RTA and LANA expression and hence lytic and latent life cycle of the infected cell [34], [35]. Consequently, targeting CBF1 signaling by antiviral drugs could be highly attractive if critical stages of the virus life cycle relevant for pathogenesis could be efficiently blocked.",

Thus, the first report which described the interaction of RTA with CBF1 used CBF1 deficient fibroblasts derived from knock-out mice to study the contribution of CBF1 to establishment of latency, reactivation and lytic infection [9], [36]. While establishment of latency was not impaired in mouse fibroblasts reactivation was blocked at the stage of delayed early gene expression. In summary, our data confirm and extend the results of previous studies. Unlike murine fibroblasts, KSHV infected CBF1 deficient B cells can enter the lytic cycle with low efficiency but no specific block before the onset of viral replication or late gene expression is installed. Using the identical recombinant rKSHV.219 virus it has been described most recently that viral reactivation is blocked at multiple stages before viral DNA synthesis in CBF proficient murine fibroblasts [37]. These multiple blocks attenuated the induction of the lytic cascade in CBF1 deficient murine fibroblasts in the previous study and most likely explain why reactivation in human B cells can still be initiated.",

Future studies should reveal whether GFP expression levels changed during in vitro cell culture due to changes in viral genome copy numbers or were caused by epigenetic modifications of the viral chromatin. Since all KSHV infected DG75 cells were grown in selective media the infection process as well as establishment of the latent state in these cells may not reflect all features of the infection process under physiological conditions.

Ectopic expression of ORF50/RTA in K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells induced ORF57 and ORF59 expression weakly but induction rates never reached the levels obtained in K-DG75 wt cells. Thus, ORF50/RTA induction in K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells is essential but not the single rate limiting factor for reactivation. Our results suggest that the attenuated lytic gene expression levels are caused by additive effects of genes that can only be weakly activated by RTA in the absence of CBF1. While virus replication is still detected in K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells at reduced levels, virion production is entirely abolished. Interestingly, we could not identify a single gene that is not activated in K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells during reactivation and thus completely dependent on CBF1 for activation (Fig. 3). We conclude that the lack of CBF1 has pleiotropic effects during the reactivation process caused by direct and indirect effects triggered by ORF50/RTA or perhaps other viral CBF1 binding proteins like ORF73/LANA or vIRF4 [38], [39]. While LANA is an antagonist of RTA function, vIRF4 cooperates and enhances RTA activities [40]. Whether this cooperation of vIRF4 and RTA is CBF1 dependent still needs to be clarified.",

In search for additional viral ORF50/RTA responsive and CBF1 dependent promoters, the putative promoters of ORF29a, ORF65, ORF9 and ORF62 were analyzed in reporter gene assays. The promoter of ORF59 was studied in parallel since ORF59 is a well characterized target gene of RTA (Fig. 7A). While activation of the endogenous ORF59 gene requires CBF1, ORF59 promoter activation is attenuated if CBF1 binding sites are deleted but RTA DNA binding sites are retained [9], [41]. Our experiments confirm that the requirement for CBF1 is much more pronounced if endogenous ORF59 gene expression is studied. These results might suggest that the chromatin state of the ORF59 gene has an important impact on promoter responses to RTA. If so, this could be relevant for the biology of the virus since the viral DNA in the infectious virus is chromatin free and unmodified.",
