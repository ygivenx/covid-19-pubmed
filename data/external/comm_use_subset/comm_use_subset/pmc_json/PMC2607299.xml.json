Thus, it represents a useful example where many organisms ranging from bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae) to fairly conserved viruses (respiratory syncytial virus) to genetically diverse viruses, i.e. influenza A virus, human rhinoviruses (HRV), and human enteroviruses (HEV) need to be detected for successful differential diagnosis. Several technologies, Masscode\u2122 multiplex RT-PCR system [1], electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of PCR amplicons [2], Luminex\u00ae xMAP\u2122 [3], and various microarray-based approaches [4-8], are currently under development as diagnostic platforms to effectively and simultaneously detect and identify large numbers of diverse viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. One high-density resequencing microarray platform, the Respiratory Pathogen Microarray version 1 (RPM v.1), has been successfully demonstrated to identify a much broader range of pathogens (including bacteria and DNA and RNA viruses) in a single test at sensitivities and specificities that are similar to or improved over those of other technologies [9,10]. In addition, the RPM v.1 platform has the demonstrated capability to discriminate among known and previously unknown strains and variants of targeted pathogens [11,12].",

            "text": "While promising, the RPM v.1 platform was a proof-of-concept microarray for the detection of 26 common respiratory pathogens primarily encountered among military basic trainees. It did not provide comprehensive coverage of all potential respiratory pathogens and the design methodology used was not appropriate for genetically diverse viruses. The design methodology for the RPM v.1 microarray consisted of applying selection rules developed for long oligonucleotide microarrays. These rules were not optimal but worked for bacterial organisms and fairly conserved viruses since previous studies had shown a single sequence on a resequencing microarray could reliably detect and serotype strains with as much as 10 to 15% variation [8,10-12]. Their application to cover more diverse viral organisms was less successful. For example, the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) sequence chosen for HRV on the RPM v.1 only provided identification of the prototype HRV-89 and very little coverage of other HRV serotypes. The 5'UTR sequences, which are relatively conserved among HRV and HEV, have been used in PCR and de novo sequencing for tentative viral identification or serotype classification in lieu of the much more variable capsid proteins that actually determine serotypes [13,14]. However, the 5'UTR sequences still have ~5 to 30% nucleotide sequence variations among different serotypes so require more than one prototype sequence for proper identification and serotyping. Serotyping HRV and HEV is important to FRI differential diagnosis because even though these \"common cold\" viruses generally only induce mild symptoms, they can cause a wide variety of other severe illnesses, such as aseptic meningitis [15], bronchitis and asthma [16].",

            "text": "New resequencing pathogen microarray designs, versions 3.0 and 3.1 (RPM-Flu v.30/31), have been constructed to address the shortcomings of the previous design. The use of 8 \u03bcm feature allows microarrays with greater coverage, currently 86, of common respiratory organisms and high human health risk zoonotic pathogens (bacteria and viruses). A new approach to select a minimal number of prototype sequences that can be used to detect all and correctly identify many of the relevant strains of genetically diverse viruses such as HRV and HEV was developed. Due to the great genetic diversity of HRV and HEV, in order to ensure that designed probes (referred to as probe sequences) generated from selected database sequences (referred to as prototype regions) would detect and discriminate all serotypes of HRV and HEV, a predictive model was used to assist the microarray design [17]. This in silico model developed for predicting resequencing microarray hybridization patterns shows good concordance in the overall percentage of base calls predicted versus experimental results. Thus it is possible to use this model for evaluating the performance of database sequences as potential prototype regions. In this study, we report on results of this algorithm applied to the 5'UTR sequences of HRV and HEV and confirm that using ~15% of the RPM-Flu v.30/31 microarray (17,335 HRV and HEV nucleotides of total 117,254 nucleotides on array) is sufficient to detect and differentiate many HRV and HEV serotypes.",

First, sequences that contain the specified target region (5'UTR) and meet any selection criteria applied were downloaded from a database (currently GenBank). Downloaded sequences were trimmed to cover the same region using pair-wise sequence alignment. These sequences were treated as target sequences (what would be detected by the microarray) and also as prototype sequences (the potential probe sequences tiled on the microarray). Each downloaded sequence was treated as a prototype used to generate probe sequences (Fig 1. Step 1\u20132) and the remaining sequences were treated as target sequences (Fig 1. Step 3\u20134). Sets of 4 25-mer probes (1 perfect match and 3 mismatches in the 13th position) were generated from a prototype sequence and correspond to what would actually appear on a resequencing microarray. The other sequences were treated as a target one at a time and generated overlapping fragments from 13 to 25 bases long with a near neighbor \u0394G energy less than -14.5. These fragments have been shown to have strong binding strength and produce unique base calls. The generated probes and sequence fragments were the input to the in silico model [17] for simulation which compared the fragments to the probe sets and determined the base calls a target sequence would generate. The predicted base calls were assembled into a simulated resequencing microarray result.",

A sequence was considered detected by the current prototype sequence if at least one region of 50 or more contiguous nucleotides was predicted to consist of A, C, G, and T base calls and no ambiguous base calls (Ns). As shown in Figure 1 \"Yes\" for \"CIBSI would identify\" updated the list of sequences that could be detected by the current prototype sequence. This procedure was applied for every downloaded sequence. For example, if we collect sequences \"a-z\" from GenBank, we will first use sequence \"a\" as a prototype sequence, then use sequences \"b-z\" each in turn to generate target sequences for in silico simulation. After the completion of the simulation and CIBSI analysis, a list of sequences from the pool of sequences \"b-z\" that can be detected by prototype sequence \"a\" will be generated. Then the cycle begins again with sequence 'b\" as prototype sequence, while sequences \"a, c-z\" each in turn is used as target sequences to generate the list for sequence \"b\". The cycle will continue until we generate the list for all download sequences (sequences 'a-z\"). After this is completed, the second stage of the process will be undertaken. The number of sequences that a sequence (as prototype) is predicted to detect will be sorted and ordered. The sequence that was predicted to detect the most other sequences (as targets) was selected as a probe sequence to be used in the microarray design. It was then removed from the list of sequences. All the target sequences detected by that prototype sequence were also removed from the list of sequences. This procedure was repeated until the list of sequences was empty. When two or more prototype sequences were predicted to detect the same maximal number of target sequences, one was randomly selected hence the method was non-deterministic. The process was repeated with different random seeds and the number of required probe sequences did not vary significantly while the sequences used in the microarray design could change.",

It was decided to use corresponding 5'UTR sequences of the 13 genomes that the 3D targets were selected from so that the same serotype was targeted by both target regions (Additional file 1). These 13 5'UTR regions were predicted to still provide complete and now redundant coverage.",

            "text": "To assess the performance of RPM-Flu v.30/31 chip design, 34 known HRV serotype strains obtained from ATCC were tested. Of the 34 strains, 18 had corresponding 5'UTR sequences tiled on the microarray and were called prototype serotypes, which were used to verify the accuracy of the designed HRV probes. The remaining 16 strains, representing near neighbor serotypes, were selected from diverse clades based on phylogenetic classification of HRV serotypes [18,19]. These strains were used to investigate the capability of the microarray to detect other HRV serotypes that did not have their sequences tiled on the microarray. Overall, the selected strains covered every single clade of 101 HRV serotypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the P1\u2013P2 regions of 5'UTR sequences [18]. One metric of the hybridization in a reference region is to divide the number of bases reported as A, C, G, or T by the total number of bases for that region (probe length), which we refer to as the base call rate and proportionally reflects the hybridization strength or homology between the prototype and target sequences. A hybridization profile (Fig. 2A) using the base call rates clearly showed a unique pattern for each serotype. The closely related serotypes with less nucleotide divergences had similar hybridization profiles across the tiled regions, so it is possible to assign species (HRVA and HRVB) based only on the hybridization patterns. The brighter red spots (higher base call rates) along the diagonal suggested that stronger hybridizations between the tiled probes and 5'UTRs from the prototype serotypes. It is also of note that HRV87 does not fall into either of two major clusters which agrees with other findings that it should really be classified as a HEV [20,21]. To validate the accuracy of the array clustering, 5'UTR of each serotype was amplified by type-specific RT-PCR and subjected to conventional sequencing. The phylogenetic tree derived from the de novo 5'UTR sequences (Additional file 2) confirms the HRVA and HRVB classification. Pair-wise sequence comparisons also indicated that the average nucleotide divergence of 5'UTR sequences between all 34 strains was 20.3%. The maximal nucleotide divergences among HRVA and HRVB strains were 33.4% and 32.7%, respectively. These results demonstrated that RPM-Flu v.30/31 chip is potentially capable of detecting genetically diverse HRV serotypes.",

            "text": "Although useful, the visual patterns are difficult to discriminate the serotypes within each species and would require generating reference patterns for all HRV serotypes. The use of sequence calls and analysis software, CIBSI [22], allows for straightforward serotype identification. The sequence analysis results showed that the identifications made by RPM-Flu v.30/31 and CIBSI are consistent with the reported typing, and could clearly differentiate most of the serotypes of the HRV (Table 1). Of the 34 HRV strains, 18 matched the selected prototype 5' UTR sequences on the RPM-Flu v.30/31 chips and showed strong hybridization signals to their corresponding prototype regions generating at least 86% base call rates. Due to the sequence homology, it is not surprising to find a noticeable and sometimes significant amount of hybridization (20 \u2013 80%) leading to base calls on prototype regions other than the correspondent prototype for most samples. Because the identification scheme used was based on comparing the sequences generated on the array to database entries, this information could be integrated into the final identification. For these samples with high base call rates, the best hit would have tens to hundreds more matched bases than the next best hit. The remaining 16 ATCC strains represent near neighbor serotypes, which 5'UTR sequences share >80% identifies to those of prototypes. In all but the case of HRV5, the information was sufficient to identify the correct serotypes. In these samples, the difference in the number of base calls matching in the best hit and the next best hit was more variable and on average was fewer. The confidence of the identification depends on the accuracy of the base call. Since the best hit always had at least one base that matched the resequencing results and was a mismatch for the next best hit, it was possible to establish the lowest confidence level that the best hit was the correct identification. The resequencing microarray's accuracy for determining the base call has been established under a variety of conditions [23]. Using this information, there is a .000001n that the next best hit is the most similar sequence in the database because a base is misidentified by the resequencing microarray where n is the number of mismatches between the next best hit and the matches for the best result. With .0001% being the largest level of uncertainty seen for these samples, it was deemed acceptable to treat the best hit as the correct identification. For HRV5, several database sequences representing different serotypes had the same score and since no further information was available it was only possible to determine that a HRV species B was present. The 5'UTR sequences from the tested strains generated with de novo sequencing were subjected to in silico predictive modeling analysis and the result of this was used as input in the CIBSI analysis program. For the case of HRV5, the in silico model predicted a larger fraction of base calls being made than were observed in the experiment. For all other samples there was a good correspondence on base call fractions between model and experiment as expected. This leads us to suspect there was a processing error or sample degradation leading to the less accurate identification.",

The hybridization profile (Figure 2B) shows distinct clusters in a similar fashion to the HRV samples based on serotypes. In this case, HEVA and HEVB make up one cluster, while HEVC and HEVD (including HRV87) comprise a second cluster. This finding is consistent with the previously described clusters for HEV UTR sequences [24,25].

The fact that the in silico model prediction was also not serotype specific indicates it was most likely a design issue. This was further confirmed by agreement in base calls made from the resequencing microarray and from conventional resequencing. Although all the strains of HEV have complete genome sequences, there are also many partial sequence submissions for each strain in GenBank that were ignored for the HEV design. A re-examination of the 5'UTR regions showed up to 14% difference in sequences grouped in the same serotype.

Our results show that the 5'UTR region did not correlate as closely as VP1-based typing to antigenic type definitions for HEV unlike how it performed for HRV.

For the RT step, primer LN was replaced by primer NLN (a random 9mer with the unique linker sequence), 1 pg each of two internal controls NAC1 and triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), and 5 \u03bcl of the extracted viral nucleic acids were used. The 5 \u03bcl RT reaction product was subjected to the multiplex PCR reaction. Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was replaced by GoTaq\u00ae DNA polymerase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) in the PCR reaction. Primer NL instead of primer L was used with 50\u2013150 nM each of 5'UTR primers in the multiplex PCR. The amplification reaction was carried out in a Peltier Thermal Cycler \u2013 PTC240 DNA Engine Tetrad 2 (MJ Research Inc., Reno, NV) with an initial incubation at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, then preliminary denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 16 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 45\u201360\u00b0C for 30 s (incremental increase of 1\u00b0C per cycle), and 72\u00b0C for 90 s, then 24 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s and 60\u00b0C for 120 s.",
