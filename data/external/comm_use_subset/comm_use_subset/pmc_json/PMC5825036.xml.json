            "text": "Pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States [1] and has the lowest 5-year survival rate (7%) for solid tumors [2] largely owing to the fact that radiation, surgery, and current chemotherapy options are ineffective. New treatment strategies are essential. Human mesothelin is normally expressed only in mesothelial cells of the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium. However, mesothelin is overexpressed in a high percentage of ovarian cancers, pancreatic cancers, non\u2013small lung cancers, and mesotheliomas, making it a potential target for anti-cancer treatments [3\u20137]. Human and mouse mesothelin share sequence similarity, expression patterns, and biochemical characteristics, [7], and the homeostatic function of mesothelin in mammals is unknown: the gene can be deleted without apparent effect in mice [8]. Human mesothelin has been proposed to be a malignancy factor as it increased tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor size in nude mice [5, 7], and siRNA specific for mesothelin suppressed tumor growth in a rat renal carcinoma model [9]. However, we have shown that stable overexpression of mesothelin in a pancreatic cancer cell line did not increase cell proliferation or anchorage- independent growth in vitro, suggesting that mesothelin is not necessarily a tumor progression factor [7]. Indeed, we tested the effect of mesothelin expression in the presence of an intact host immune system and found that overexpression of mesothelin unexpectedly decreased metastases and even inhibited tumor formation in vivo in immunocompetent mice [7]. This suggested that an immune response to mesothelin might be effective in reducing tumor growth.",

            "text": "Tumor associated antigens are of interest as targets because they are expressed on cancerous cells, but not on most normal adult tissues. A number of studies, including Phase 1 and II clinical trials, are ongoing to target mesothelin expressing cancers [5, 10\u201314]. Chimeric antibodies, immunotoxins, and drug conjugates that bind mesothelin are being tested as well as chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T cells) that bind and kill mesothelin-expressing cells. Live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes-expressing mesothelin is being evaluated as an anti-cancer vaccine [5, 10\u201314]. Both antibodies and T lymphocytes have been shown to have protective anti-mesothelin activity [5, 10, 13\u201315]. This fact may be especially useful because irradiation of tumor cells enhances the expression of mesothelin [14], so that an anti-mesothelin vaccine may be an effective combination with irradiation. The most well-characterized recombinant immunotoxins against mesothelin are SS1P and monoclonal antibodies are MORAb-009 [16]. A phase I study of SS1P given as a bolus i.v. infusion to 2 patients with mesothelin-expressing pancreatic cancers was published in 2007 showing safety and feasibility but, unfortunately, no clinical response [17]. Additional high affinity monoclonal antibodies have been developed which bind to alternative regions of the mesothelin protein, allowing for additional mesothelin targeting in the presence of MORAb-009/SS1 or MUC16 [18].",

            "text": "Several poxviruses are used as recombinant vectors to develop vaccines for a wide range of infectious diseases including bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens, as well as for cancer therapies, and several are approved or currently in clinical trials [19\u201326]. The only HIV vaccine with demonstrated efficacy in humans to date employs an avian poxvirus vector, and it entered NIH-sponsored Phase 2b/3 trials in 2016 [27]. Poxviruses such as vaccinia virus are suitable as vectors because they are easily grown to high titer in a wide variety of animals and cell types, can accommodate insertions of large pieces of DNA into their genomes, are very stable even when dried, and induce robust B and T cell immunity [19, 28\u201330]. Vaccinia virus is the most commonly used poxvirus vaccine vector; however, its use is limited by its potential virulence, especially in immunocompromised hosts [19, 21, 29, 30]. Raccoonpox virus provides a safer vector compared to vaccinia virus [19, 21, 26, 30], and the Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain is even more attenuated, because it cannot replicate in most mammalian cells [31]. However MVA immunogenicity has been limiting, requiring high doses and boost vaccinations [28, 31\u201338]. Poxviruses have been shown to have efficacy as a vaccine platform against cancers [19, 39, 40], but patient responses still need to be improved. In order to strengthen immune responses and treatment outcomes, we have developed a recombinant MVA (MVAA35Del) that is missing the immunosuppressive A35 virulence gene that blocks antigen presentation and B and T lymphocyte responses [29, 31, 41\u201343]. Removal of the A35 gene improves antibody and cytokine production, numbers of responding T lymphocytes, and immunoglobulin class switching [29, 31].",

The Panc02 tumor line was derived from C57Bl6 mice and thus can be grown in syngeneic mice to allow for study of an anti-tumor immune response in an immunocompetent mouse model. This has a great advantage over tumor studies performed with xeno- or allografts in immunocompromised mice. To determine whether we can improve vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy, we test the parental normal MVAmeso virus vaccine against the MVA mesothelin expressing virus that has had the immunosuppressive A35 gene removed (MVAmesoA35Del).",

We used the normal wild type MVA or the MVA in which the A35 virulence gene had been deleted [31] to create the MVAmeso virus and the MVAmesoA35Del recombinant viruses respectively. In both cases, mesothelin was cloned into a vector (pLW44, a gift from L. Wyatt, National Institutes of Health) designed for insertion into an area of the MVA genome where genes had been naturally deleted during passage of the virus [44]. Recombinant viruses expressing the gfp marker protein were selected, purified, and analyzed to confirm the genotype by raid prep PCR analysis [45]. The presence of the mesothelin gene was confirmed using mesothelin-specific primers (GGCTGGCTATGGCTGTAAGAC and AGCAGTGTTGGATGAGTCCATCGT) with an annealing temperature of 51\u00b0 C. In order to assess the presence of the A35 gene, recombinant viruses were analyzed using A35 specific primers (TGACTATAACAGATACATT and CAGATTATCTGAAGGATTGAT) at an annealing temperature of 40\u00b0 C. To confirm the insertion sites of the mesothelin, we used primers in the MVA flanking regions, (CATAAGTATAAAGTCCGACTATTGTTC and GATAAAGTTGCATCATCACCTAT). The PCR amplicons were run on an 0.8% agarose gel.",

We attempted to measure reactivity to Panc02 cells, which express mesothelin on the surface by flow cytometry as we have done previously [7], however we got very low responses, possibly due to released mesothelin (Fig 2) binding the anti mesothelin antibodies in vivo. We then measured the frequency of anti-mesothelin IFN-gamma secreting T lymphocytes by ELISpot assay. Mice vaccinated with PBS or MVA had very few (<5) splenocytes that secreted IFN-gamma in response to Panc02 cells (Fig 4). MVAmeso vaccinated mice had an average of 53 IFN-gamma secreting T cells per 106 splenocytes, and MVAmesoA35Del had an average of 80, significantly more (p<0.05) than MVA and PBS treated mice. In comparison, there were very few spots (1\u20133) in response to stimulation with Lewis Lung cells that do not express mouse mesothelin, and mice vaccinated with MVA, MVAmeso and MVAmesoA35Del viruses all had good responses to restimulation with vaccinia virus (124, 147, and 148 spots respectively). These results indicate that while all mice responded to the virus infection, and the mesothelin expressing viruses induced an immune response in mice that reactivated in response to mesothelin expressing Panc02 cells. Additionally, vaccination with the MVAmesoA35Del virus induced 52% more responding T lymphocytes compared to the MVAmeso virus, suggesting that removal of the A35 induced a stronger immune response, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.",

MVA is unable to replicate in almost all mammalian cells: baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells are one known exception in which MVA can replicate. BHK and Panc02 cells were infected at an MOI of 5 pfu/cell so that each cell would be infected, and the supernatants and cells were harvested separately and titered for virus quantity over time. As shown in Fig 5, over 48 h the number of infectious MVA virions (plaque forming units, pfu) increased in BHK cells more than 2 logs. MVA replication in Panc02 cells also increased by more than 2 logs, suggesting that the MVA viruses might be effective oncolytic viruses in vivo since they can infect and replicate selectively in the Panc02 tumor cells, while unable to replicate in normal mammalian tissues. Viruses released into the supernatants also increased during MVA infection of both cell lines. These results were promising, because they indicated that the virus could potentially amplify in situ and spread to cells that were not initially infected at the time of virus inoculation.",

Mice were injected i.m. with PBS, wild type MVA, MVAmeso, or MVAmesoA35Del, and boosted 2 weeks later. Two weeks after the boost, tumor cells were injected s.c. contralaterally in the flank. As shown in Fig 8A, the prior vaccination with MVAmeso or MVAmesoA35Del did not significantly decrease tumor growth or increase survival times. Next, we attempted direct intratumoral injections since MVA is able to replicate in and kill Panc02 cells in vitro. We injected tumor cells s.c. and when tumors reached 100 mm3, we injected PBS, wild type MVA, MVAmeso, or MVAmesoA35Del directly into tumors 3 times, 5 days apart, however, we were unable to detect a benefit (Fig 8B). We also attempted to treat stable mesothelin overexpressing Panc02 [7] tumors by intratumoral injection, however there was no apparent effect, as tumors continued to grow and mice had to be euthanized.",

            "text": "We have shown that murine mesothelin can be expressed from the MVA virus genome and detected as a ~50 kDa monomer protein on SDS-PAGE immunoblot, and a ~100 kDa presumed dimer. Mesothelin is released from cells and can be detected in the supernatants of cultured cells [7] and in much higher quantities in cells infected with MVA viruses that expresses mesothelin under a viral promoter. Injection of the mesothelin expressing viruses into animals caused no apparent ill effect to at least 4 months after vaccination, suggesting that MVAmeso vaccine is safe and does not initiate a deleterious autoimmune response. The MVAmeso vaccine induced a strong response to the mesothelin expressing Panc02 tumor cell line, only slightly smaller than the amount of anti-vaccinia virus T lymphocytes induced by injection of vaccinia virus [29]. These results indicate that the mesothelin protein was expressed in an immunogenic form by the virus in the infected mice. Furthermore, MVA virus (with and without mesothelin expression) was able to replicate in and kill Panc02 tumor cells grown in vitro, suggesting that it would be an effective oncolytic virus in vivo. Our previous results suggested that mesothelin might be a good target for control by an immune response [7], as mesothelin overexpression reliably caused a decrease in a heterotopic tumor growth in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model while in vitro proliferation was not inhibited [7]. Together, these results suggested that MVAmeso might be an effective treatment for Pancc02 tumors, and that the MVAmesoA35Del might be more effective given its improved immunogenic properties [31].",

            "text": "However, we were unable to demonstrate any efficacy of the mesothelin MVA vaccines prophylactically or therapeutically, even with multiple boosts or when injected directly into the tumors. One possibility is that the Panc02 tumor cell line is simply too aggressive for control in an animal model where the tumor microenvironment may act to protect and promote tumor cell growth [7]. While we had hoped that intratumoral injection would allow the virus to replicate in, spread, and kill tumor cells, we did not see a potent oncolytic effect in animals. Perhaps while the MVA virus can kill Panc02 tumor cells in vitro, the anti-viral immune response in vivo limits the replication and spread of the virus. An ineffective anti-tumor immune response may also be caused by the shedding of mesothelin by the tumor in vivo (decoy mesothelin) blocking the immune effector antibodies and T cells. Mesothelin is known to be detectable in supernatants of Panc02 cells [7] and in sera from patients with mesothelin expressing tumors [6, 48, 49]. This shed soluble mesothelin may be taken up by other cells and bind anti-mesothelin antibodies rendering them ineffective. These problems may be worsened by administration of these mesothelin-expressing viruses because they also release soluble mesothelin at high levels. Another possibility is that the shed mesothelin induces a state of anergy/tolerance in the animal, but our data show that mesothelin specific T lymphocytes are generated in these animals even though there is soluble circulating mesothelin shed from the mesothelin virus infected cells. Perhaps new developments with CART cells [10] may be able to more effectively facilitate T cell targeting and killing of cancerous cells.",

Tumors that develop in humans and animals have already been highly selected in vivo to avoid the immune responses that control cancers. Further improvements in these oncolytic therapeutic vaccines may be made by including cytokines such as IL-10 and GMCSF, which have been reported to improve oncolytic potential of vaccinia virus and ultimately host survival [50, 51]. In addition, depletion of T regulatory cells may counteract homeostatic or cancer cell driven immunosuppression and enhance the development of mesothelin-specific CD8 T cells capable of killing tumor cells [52, 53]. Although some results suggest that immune responses can be counter-productive: the anti mesothelin immune response may induce autoantibodies to the target antigen as well as other proteins by epitope spreading, and these antigen-spreading autoantibodies may cause increased damage to the animal. It was previously shown that antigen spreading was associated with a trend toward decreased survival in patients with prostate cancer treated with a recombinant viral vaccine [46].",
