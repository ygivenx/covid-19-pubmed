In a recent review exploring the associations between zoonoses and poverty, a ranking of \u2018important\u2019 zoonoses was made on the basis of human mortality, human morbidity, impact on the livestock sector, amenability to agriculture-based control, and emergence or severity of disease in people [1]. The 13 top-ranked zoonoses were responsible for 2.2 million human deaths and 2.4 billion cases of illness every year [1]. Notwithstanding the devastating impacts of the recent West African Ebola disease epidemic, it is salutary to note that, every year, rabies and leptospirosis are estimated to cause five times as many human deaths, with an estimated 59 000 people dying from each of these diseases annually [2,3]. Other endemic zoonoses may well have impacts of comparable magnitude [1], but in many cases, we lack the data to define and demonstrate these impacts fully.",

First, for most endemic zoonoses, there is little potential for sustained transmission in human populations and therefore little risk of transboundary spread to high-income countries through human movements and contacts. Second, measures for the prevention, treatment and control of endemic zoonoses are often available to protect people and animals in high-income countries and the disease burden is much less substantial than in neglected communities. These factors reduce immediate awareness and concern about disease risk at international level, which in turn impacts on the perceived need to prioritize investments for disease control and prevention in low-income settings.",

Many endemic zoonoses present with non-specific clinical signs in both people and animals and are easy to misdiagnose on clinical grounds [4]. These zoonoses are poorly recognized by healthcare providers [5,6] and are often overlooked in differential diagnoses. Well-validated point-of-care diagnostic tests are rarely available, and diagnosis of chronic stages or sequelae of infections is often difficult. The pattern of under-recognition of zoonoses persists, despite a growing body of evidence that many zoonoses are important causes of common human disease syndromes, such as undifferentiated fever, in both Africa and Asia [6\u201312].",

Most of these zoonoses have long been recognized in the medical and veterinary literature, are well understood and are often well controlled in high-income countries. Instead, their neglect occurs because the risks and burden of these zoonoses fall heavily on disadvantaged and vulnerable communities with little political voice in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [13\u201315]. The term \u2018unattended\u2019 diseases, as used in the Global Goals for Sustainable Development (SDG 3) [16], may better reflect the lack of attention given to diseases affecting disadvantaged communities, as well as the ineffective, inappropriate or lack of application of available measures for disease control and prevention.",

There are several reasons why it is the rural poor who are most vulnerable to exposure, infection and the downstream consequences of endemic zoonoses [13,14,17]: (i) because close contact with animals and traditional food consumption practices heighten exposure risks; (ii) because zoonotic diseases often affect livestock production, so it is people in poor livestock-dependent communities who are highly vulnerable to the impacts of zoonoses on livelihoods, food security and wellbeing; (iii) because the rural poor generally have limited access to high-quality human and animal health services for clinical care and treatment of illness; and (iv) because there are numerous social, political and economic issues that affect the ability of individuals to act in particular ways (individual agency), so the poor often have limited capacity to mitigate or manage disease risks. Figure 1 illustrates those countries in Africa, particularly in East and West Africa, where risks and vulnerabilities are likely to be particularly intense, characterized by areas where there is convergence of high livestock and domestic dog densities, a high proportion of the population engaged in agriculture and poor provision of health services.\n",

Thus, despite large-scale investments in surveillance for diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, fewer than 20% of United Nations member states are able to effectively implement the International Health Regulations [24]. Once the immediate threat of an emerging disease has passed, and crisis funding and donor support removed, it may be difficult for governments in low-income countries to maintain support for the staff, skills and laboratory infrastructure needed to detect and respond to rare emerging disease outbreaks that are of little day-to-day concern to their populations.",

The lessons of past disease outbreaks and response efforts show that the adaptation of existing networks and capacities to deal with new threats is crucial. This approach has recently been advocated in the regional meeting of Health and Agriculture Ministries in Latin America on the management of zoonose risks, with emerging, re-emerging and endemic zoonoses considered as linked priorities, and with integrated surveillance and coordinated governance key pillars of strengthening One Health capability [25].

For example, following a prioritization exercise that was conducted in Ethiopia, rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis and echinococcus were identified as the five zoonoses of greatest concern in Ethiopia, and recommendations were made for strengthening intersectoral surveillance and interventions against these diseases, with regular review to address new emerging zoonotic disease threats [26].

These include a commitment to accelerating progress not only in relation to diseases that are of widespread international concern (such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and Ebola virus disease) but equally to those that affect disadvantaged communities, i.e. the neglected or unattended diseases affecting developing countries (Target 3.3) [16]. Goal 3 further combines a commitment to strengthening capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks (Target 3.d) with a target of achieving universal health coverage and access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all (Target 3.8) [16].

Intersectoral governance mechanisms have often been established in response to crises to address specific risks. However, trust between stakeholders and communities to support and build effective health systems cannot be spontaneously generated. Trust is built and is founded on experience, and can be developed through planned and regular interactions of all stakeholders, including representatives of heterogeneous communities, to address endemic zoonotic risks.

While improvements in diagnosis and clinical management are urgently needed, we also need to understand the specific, economic, political and social forces that constrain the agency of individuals to act in particular ways. One Health can provide important understanding of the systemic reasons why some individuals are more affected by zoonoses than others because of its focus on animal\u2013human interactions and on identifying which humans are interacting with which animals under what conditions [30]. These previously under-recognised vulnerabilities to disease intersect with socio-economic power relations and other structural factors, which in turn constrain health-seeking behaviour. For example, a study of women's experiences when seeking treatment for fever, which was carried out in a deprived urban community in Tanzania, highlighted the sense of helplessness experienced by these women when negotiating the health system:I have a fear of the payment, and not of the sickness. Treatment exists, good treatment that will cure quickly, but you worry you will not be able to find the money in time because a fever does not wait for you. You worry if you will be able to find the money to get treatment before the patient dies [31, p. 128].",

Other problems that were frequently reported included waiting for treatment, while other, less-disadvantaged people \u2018queue-jumped\u2019, and having to provide bribes to be seen by doctors. These women's experiences demonstrate that poverty is more than just a lack of resource to make better decisions; they also point to the ways in which the sense of themselves as capable agents was being eroded.

When implemented on a national level, vaccination has been one of the most equitable low-cost, high-impact public health measures, saving millions of lives annually in LMICs [38]. However, this principle has been embraced less when the public health intervention is targeted at the animal population, even when the intervention has shown to be feasible and cost-effective, as in the case of mass vaccination of dogs against rabies, discussed below. One Health provides a useful framework for broadening the scope of potential interventions that might be considered by public health agencies, particularly in rural communities. In the case of livestock-mediated zoonoses, further advantages of One Health interventions relate to the added benefits to human health and livelihoods generated through improvements to livestock health and productivity.",

Human deaths can be prevented by a combination of prompt administration of PEP and mass vaccination of domestic dog reservoirs, but the relative levels of investment in these two arms of prevention are often mismatched. In Asia, for example, the incidence of human rabies cases is much higher than in Latin America, despite the elevated levels of per capita expenditure on human PEP provision in Asia (figure 2). Here, even though health sector expenditure on PEP is very high (with US$ 1.3 billion of direct costs spent annually on PEP in Asia), poor people are still dying from rabies due to lack of access to health services with PEP. Conversely, many doses of PEP are given to animal-bite victims who will have had no rabies exposure, often in relatively affluent urban areas. By contrast, measures to prevent rabies at source (i.e. through mass dog vaccination) protect both the rich and the poor, casting a wider \u2018safety net\u2019 than can be achieved by focusing on management of human exposures alone and cost considerably less. In Latin America, for example, even modest investments in mass dog vaccination (US$ 61 million per year, representing approximately 20% total expenditure on rabies prevention) [2] have been highly effective in preventing human rabies deaths, with the region on the brink of eliminating dog rabies as a human health problem [43].\n",

Illnesses caused by these zoonotic pathogens are often difficult to diagnose and are frequently misdiagnosed: the clinical symptoms and signs are often non-specific, and easily mistaken for malaria [6]; laboratory confirmatory tests are rarely available; healthcare provider awareness is generally low [5]; and patients often present at hospital only in the later stages of infection when diagnostic confirmation is much more challenging. As malaria transmission declines in many parts of Africa [51,55], the importance of zoonoses as causes of non-malaria febrile illness is becoming more apparent. For example, in a study involving 870 patients hospitalized with fever in northern Tanzania [6], bacterial zoonoses, which were not initially considered by clinicians in any cases, were confirmed as a cause of disease in 26.2% of cases. Malaria, although clinically diagnosed in the majority of cases (60.7%), was confirmed as the cause of fever in only very few (1.6%). While the relative contribution of different zoonoses to the aetiology of febrile illness varies by location, livestock-associated zoonoses have been consistently identified in several recent studies from East Africa. For example, leptospirosis and Q fever were confirmed in a small number of cases of systemic febrile infections in children in one outpatient study in Tanzania [51], and in a much higher proportion of febrile children in an outpatient study from a different region, also in Tanzania (with 11.6% patients diagnosed with presumptive acute leptospirosis, 13% with confirmed leptospirosis and 22.4% with presumptive brucellosis) [11].",

In an analysis of patients presenting with acute leptospirosis in Tanzania, urinary antibacterial activity was detected by bioassay in 31 (64.6%) of 48 cases, and is likely to have contributed to the inability of PCR diagnostic tests to detect infection in either plasma or urine samples at the time of presentation [57].",

Vaccination of sheep and goats is the mainstay of current national brucellosis control and elimination strategies that are being implemented across Eastern Europe and Central Asia [60], with substantial declines in small ruminant and human disease documented in Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia and vaccinated regions of Tajikistan [60]. In some countries where small ruminant vaccination has been implemented, bovine brucellosis has also been reduced (e.g. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan), indicating that a greater proportion of bovine brucellosis is attributable to Brucella melitensis infection than is commonly considered [60]. These outcomes are consistent with findings from Tanzania that implicate sheep and goats as the likely source of infection in both people and cattle [61]. In Mongolia, small ruminant vaccination has also been shown to be a highly cost-effective strategy when considering both human health benefits and livestock production gains [62].",

For example, uptake may be compromised if animals identified for vaccination under epidemiologically optimal strategies are not the same as those considered by owners as the most valuable (e.g. in terms of traction power, food provision or social value). Household-level decisions will also need to be made as to how to balance potential costs for healthcare and treatment against recurring costs of preventive measures. These decisions will be particularly difficult for interventions directed at disease syndromes with multiple aetiologies, such as febrile illness, when the links between animal infection and human disease may be poorly appreciated, and the impact of any single intervention will only reduce a proportion of the overall burden of the disease syndrome (box 1).",

This poses several challenges for interventions based on livestock vaccination, which tend to focus on economic benefits from improved livestock productivity. National campaigns and government investment in livestock disease control are usually limited to notifiable and transboundary livestock diseases, and most countries lack coordinated programmes for large-scale control of endemic diseases, including many zoonoses [67]. Even where attention is focused on control of animal diseases for improving public health and rural development, current policies emphasize private sector involvement, with attention being given to innovative financing mechanisms, such as Development Impact Bonds [73], as well as product and market development to facilitate and support uptake by smallholder farmers [74]. However, if One Health interventions have to be sustained only or largely by direct payments from animal owners, they are unlikely to help overcome existing inequalities that disadvantage the rural poor in relation to affordability or access to health services. To achieve successful control of many zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis) [70] and the population-level benefits that would address existing health inequalities, careful consideration clearly needs to be given to the balance of private and public investment, to ensure sustainability and equity and to justify the use of scarce public resources.",

In Tanzania, these ideas are being explored through a programme investigating whether the reach and cost-effectiveness of MDA targeting soil-transmitted helminths in children and mass vaccination of domestic dogs against rabies can be improved through integration. Adopting One Health approaches, the project aims to break down traditional barriers that exist between veterinary and human health interventions, and build on the community trust achieved through the provision of a common good (effective control of rabies) in order to achieve cost savings, develop synergies and improve the effectiveness of both interventions. Further opportunities to establish co-delivery across a range of health interventions exist, not only for integrating control measures against several different zoonoses [73], but also for cross-linkages with public health interventions, such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes, and joint delivery of public health and veterinary services, particularly in remote or nomadic rural communities [79].",
