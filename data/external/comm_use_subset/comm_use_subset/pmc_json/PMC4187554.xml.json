Although NGF was discovered in the context of nerve growth and function, it has been shown to be produced by both structural and nonstructural cells in the lung (Hoyle 2003; Frossard et al. 2004). NGF is involved in the development of several airway diseases, such as asthma, and neurogenic inflammation (Braun et al. 1998; Nassenstein et al. 2006). Elevated levels of NGF have been shown to cause airway hyperreactivity, enhance the airway inflammatory response in ovalbumin\u2010sensitized mice, and cause airway remodeling (Braun et al. 1998; Freund and Frossard 2004). Both NGF and its receptors, trkA and p75, are upregulated during respiratory syncytial virus infections (Hu et al. 2002; Tortorolo et al. 2005). No studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of NGF on ion transport in airway epithelial cells.",

The PCL is necessary for mucociliary clearance of infectious organisms and inhaled particles (Toczylowska\u2010Maminska and Dolowy 2012). The PCL is maintained by the coordinated action of many ion channels, pumps, and transporters (Knowles et al. 1984; Toczylowska\u2010Maminska and Dolowy 2012). Disruption of ion transport can contribute to airway diseases, such as mucus thickening in cystic fibrosis due to PCL dehydration, lung edema due to an inhibition of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC; Chen et al. 2004; Morty et al. 2007; Ji et al. 2009), and interfere with regulatory mechanisms in the airways, such as the release of epithelium\u2010derived relaxing factor which induces relaxation of airway smooth muscle and submucosal blood vessels (Prazma et al. 1994; Fedan et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2004).",

It is possible, therefore, that NGF could affect Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity in addition to Na+ transport. To investigate whether NGF affects Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity, the apical membrane was permeabilized with nystatin (50 \u03bcmol/L; apical), and responses to ouabain were obtained in the absence (Fig. 9A) or presence (Fig. 9B) of NGF (1 ng/mL). In the presence of nystatin, apically applied NGF had no effect on Isc, in contrast to responses of cells in the absence of nystatin (data not shown). There was no significant difference in the responses to ouabain between the vehicle control and NGF\u2010treated groups (Control 98.4 \u00b1 1.2%, NGF 99.7 \u00b1 0.8%; data not shown). These results suggest that the NGF\u2010induced Erk 1/2 activation is a localized signaling event which occurs at the apical membrane that affects amiloride\u2010sensitive Na+ transport but not basolateral Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity.",

Furthermore, K\u2010252a and PD\u201098059 inhibited NGF's effect. Apically permeabilized epithelial cells were unresponsive to NGF, and NGF was found to have no effect on the Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) also has been shown to activate an Erk 1/2\u2010mediated pathway and selectively inhibit ENaC without affecting Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity (Shen and Cotton 2003). Thus, the ability of NGF to activate the Erk 1/2 signaling, as well as the possibility that NGF, acting through this second messenger pathway, could phosphorylate ENaC was investigated. Treatment with apical NGF (1 ng/mL, 5 min) resulted in a twofold Erk 1/2 activation (Fig. 11A) and a threefold increase in \u03b2\u2010ENaC phosphorylation (Fig. 11B) as compared to controls. The increases in Erk 1/2 activity and \u03b2\u2010ENaC phosphorylation were blocked by K\u2010252a (10 nmol/L, apical) and PD\u201098059 (30 \u03bcmol/L, apical and basolateral; Fig. 11C). Although there was a threefold increase in \u03b2\u2010ENaC phosphorylation, there were no changes in total \u03b2\u2010ENaC (Fig. 12). These results could suggest that NGF, acting though a trkA\u2010Erk 1/2\u2010mediated pathway, causes the phosphorylation of ENaC, which could be associated with reduced Na+ transport.",

Although NGF activates the Erk1/2 signaling pathway downstream of the trkA receptor and activated Erk1/2 has been shown to phosphorylate and downregulate ENaC, no previous study has investigated NGF's ability to activate the Erk1/2 signaling pathway and the resulting phosphorylation of ENaC in airway epithelial cells.",

This rapid signaling coincides with the rapid electrophysiological responses stimulated by NGF. Thus, the bioelectric and the biochemical events would appear to have followed a similar time course. After 30\u2010min incubation with NGF, at a time when NGF concentration in the chamber had diminished substantially, the effect of amiloride was blunted and was no longer significant.

Falin and Cotton (2007) using MDCK cells demonstrated that EGF induced an Erk\u2010mediated reduction in Na+ transport as a result of ENaC phosphorylation, but a reduction in ENaC surface expression was not observed until after 60 min. It is possible that longer incubations with NGF (under conditions in which NGF levels might somehow be stabilized in MKHS) could reveal ENaC degradation late in the response. During diseases such RSV infections, NGF is significantly increased in the cell fraction of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but not in the serum (Tortorolo et al. 2005). This increased NGF level has been attributed to increased production by the infiltrating inflammatory cells. The increased production and release of NGF by inflammatory cells would result in a continuous release of NGF and exposure of the epithelium, and, perhaps, initiate changes in ion transport by mechanisms uncovered during this investigation.",
