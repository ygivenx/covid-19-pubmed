            "text": "Toroviruses (ToV) are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses of cattle, horses, pigs and humans [1]. They have been associated with enteric infections and diarrhea, especially in young animals and children [2], and are considered a potential zoonotic threat [3]. The Torovirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales) comprises four species: equine torovirus (EToV), bovine torovirus (BToV), porcine torovirus (PToV) and human torovirus (HToV). The few epidemiological studies performed in different countries indicate high prevalences of these viruses [4-6]. The torovirus\u2019s genome size (~ 28 kb) and organization are very similar to those of other coronaviruses, with two huge overlapping open reading frames (ORF) shaping the 5\u2032-end of the genome, where the replicase/transcriptase machinery is encoded, and a final third of the RNA molecule hosting the coding sequences for the four structural proteins (from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032): spike (S), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [7]. By analogy to other nidoviruses, the S protein is considered to be the putative receptor binding molecule. Copies of this molecule form the large spikes protruding from the viral particles as shown by electron microscopy [8,9]. The HE protein forms homodimers which make up the smaller spikes [5,10]. This HE protein is a class I membrane glycoprotein of about 65 kDa that belongs to the receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) protein family. As an RDE protein HE provides reversible binding to glycosylated surfaces [11] due to its ability to bind sialic acids and catalyze the disruption of that binding by means of its acetyl-esterase activity. The 3D structure and sialic acid preference of PToV- (strain Markelo) and BToV- (strain Breda) HE proteins have been solved [12]. Two main domains have been defined in the HE monomer of both proteins: the enzymatic acetyl-esterase region (E) and the receptor binding (R) or lectin domain.",

            "text": "Despite the great amount of knowledge acquired on this protein family, it is not yet clear what is the exact role of HE during the torovirus infectious cycle. The EToV, the only cell culture adapted torovirus, as well as different BToV strains that could be isolated in cell culture, all lack a functional HE protein [13-16] due to deletions or mutations in the HE gene, acquired during their adaptation to in vitro growth conditions. Thus, HE expression seems to be detrimental for in vitro culture of these viruses, as it occurs with the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [17]. However, the maintenance of the HE protein in a vast majority of new PToV and BToV field isolated strains indicates that it has to play an important function during in vivo infections. Several hypothetical functions have been postulated for the ToV-HE: (i) being a viral co-receptor, (ii) digestion of mucus layers to allow the virus to reach the target cells in the respiratory and/or enteric tracts, (iii) release of viral particles bound to decoy receptors, (iv) influencing host/cell tropism, or as recently proposed by de Groot\u2019s group, (v) acting as a molecular timer in the virus pre-attachment step to the host-cell [18].",

Recently, during a longitudinal survey of PToV in a Spanish pig herd, several PToV-HE isolates representative of both lineages were identified [20], and similar findings were described from a survey performed in Korea [21]. In the first case, the two PToV-HE lineages were detected even within the same animal at two sequential sampling time points, indicating that both PToV strains carrying different HE proteins coexisted on the same farm infecting the same piglets, and suggesting that the immune response generated against one PToV strain did not protect the animals against the infection by the other strain. To further investigate this hypothesis PToV-HE proteins corresponding to each HE lineage were expressed, characterized, and used to track the anti-HE response in the animals from the farm where the PToV strains were obtained. The analysis of serum samples by hemagglutination inhibition assay and ELISA revealed antigenic differences between the two HE lineages.",

Interestingly, two PToV strains, one from each of the described lineages were isolated from the same animal (pig 52, litter B) at different time-points of the piglet\u2019s life, at 7- and 11-weeks of age. The HE from the virus isolated at week 7, named PToV-HE52.7, was 94.4% homologous to Markelo HE at the amino acid level, whereas the protein from the virus found at week 11, HE52.11, was more closely related to P4 HE (93.4% homology). The direct comparison between both PToV-HE52.7 and PToV-HE52.11 gave a 77.9% identity, a homology that is similar to those obtained when comparing previous reported HE sequences from both HE lineages [19,21]. To study the amino acid differences between both HE lineages, a sequence alignment from HE proteins corresponding to viruses identified in three different geographical regions was performed. The HE sequences from the Spanish PToV strains HE12.11, HE52.11, HE14.7 and HE52.7 [20] were compared with those from other European strains Markelo, P78, P4 [19] and Bres [23], and from Korean strains 56\u201314 and 56\u201323 and 56\u201311 and 56\u201322 [21]. The alignment shows that several amino acid positions were conserved in a lineage specific manner (Figure 1A, grey shade), even in the geographically distant Korean strains. These lineage specific amino acids were located in the Markelo tridimensional structural model [12], and, as shown in Figure 1B, these differential amino acids (blue balls) were found mainly placed on the surface of the receptor binding domain, suggesting that they could mark potential antigenic differences between both HE lineages.",

The lysate from cells infected with rVV-HA- served as the negative control. At 4 \u00b0C, both DFP+ and DFP- rVV-HE cell extracts were able to induce hemagglutination of mouse RBC at a similar HA titer, whereas the HA- cell extract did not hemagglutinate the mouse RBC at any of the amounts tested (Figure 3C). When plates were placed at 37 \u00b0C, the hemagglutination net induced by DFP- cell extracts was disrupted due to their acetyl-esterase activity at that temperature, however hemagglutination was maintained in DFP-treated HE containing wells, indicating that the acetyl-esterase activity was completely inhibited (Figure 3D).",

Hence, in order to examine the potential existence of antigenic differences between the two lineages of PToV-HE proteins, piglet serum samples were analyzed with an HI assay to detect the presence of specific antibodies against the receptor binding domain that prevents the RBC hemagglutination. In the HI test, DFP inactivated HE52.7 and HE52.11 cell lysates were used to avoid artifacts in the assay derived from the HE esterase activity. Using serum samples from the longitudinal survey, different HI antibody response dynamics against HE52.7 and HE52.11 proteins were observed. Anti-HE52.7 antibodies were detected at week 1 in 65% of the piglets (7/12) (Figure 4G), even though all piglets from litter B were negative against that particular lineage at that time-point (Figure 4C). With respect to the anti-HE52.11 inhibitory reaction in week 1 sera, none of the animals in litter C was reactive against it (Figure 4F), and only one piglet from litter B had specific anti-HE52.11 HI reactivity (Figure 4D). However all piglets from litter A had high HI titers towards this lineage, in agreement with the high HI titer of their sow (Figure 4B). Independently of their lineage specificity, the HI titers decreased at week 3 (coinciding with weaning) in all but one anti-HE positive piglets, however, the percentages of positive animals against both HE proteins remained constant until week 7 (Figure 4G). Up to that week, the reactivity to HE52.11 was circumscribed to piglets within litter A (Figure 4B). At week 11, just 25% of the piglets (3/12) were reactive against HE52.7, and a bare 20% presented anti-HE52.11 antibodies (Figure 4G). By week 15, 67% of the piglets (8/12) were positive against HE52.11 (Figure 4G). Although anti-HE52.7 reactivity was also observed in 33% (4/12) of the piglets, all those animals had higher HI titers against HE52.11.",

Although there are differences in the magnitude of the ELISA titers among the different piglets, what is clear from these results is that once maternally acquired antibodies had vanished, which for the N protein occurs around weaning time (week 3 of age), all animals developed their own anti-N antibodies that can readily be detected in most animals by week 7.

Without an in vitro culture system and given the great difficulties and costs of in vivo research, the use of heterologous expression systems represents a useful and relatively inexpensive approach to study the PToV-HE protein. Here we used the recombinant VACV methodology to express two full PToV-HE sequences, HE52.7 and HE52.11, and their two corresponding soluble fractions attached to a c-myc tag. Those HE coding sequences had been previously identified during a thorough longitudinal study of PToV in a Spanish farm [20], and each of them were found to belong to one of the two defined PToV-HE lineages [19]. These HE sequences were obtained from the same animal in sequential collection points. This finding indicated that both lineages co-existed on the farm [20] although with apparently different prevalences according to the age of the host. This result could lead to new possibilities to approach the PToV-HE behavior in the virus\u2019 natural environment.",

This analysis also indicates that potential antigenic differences would be mainly determined by residues located at the receptor binding domain, and exposed on the surface of the protein according to the proposed structural model [12]. Hence, to elucidate if HE lineage specific changes could determine antigenic differences on the receptor binding domain, the HE 52.7 and 52.11 proteins were used as model proteins in HI assays with field serum samples from the same farm where both lineages were detected. Significantly, by this assay most serum samples show preferential reactivity to one of the HE proteins, or even specific reactivity against only one of them (see Figure 4H), indicating the existence of antigenic differences between the two HE lineages. Antigenic differences between HE proteins from the two known BToV lineages have also been described [17].",

At 11-weeks of age, immune levels recovered due to the development of the pigs\u2019 own response to infections, and they increased at least until week 15. At this last sampled point, a general increase of reactivity against HE52.11 (P4-like) was found in animal sera from the three litters, indicative of the prevalence of this lineage upon time. Overall, similar antibody patterns were observed by ELISA against the HE proteins and the N protein, although a delay in both the extinction of maternally derived antibodies and the development of self-acquired antibodies against the HE was observed in all animals analyzed (see Figure 5 and Additional file 2).",

            "text": "The rising of antibodies to PToV antigens after weaning can be explained as a consequence of the animal grouping in livestock facilities for fattening purposes that provides the conditions for piglet infection and/or re-infection and the mixture of PToV strains in the same animal population. Our results indicate that the immune response developed against one of the PToV lineages could not protect against the infection by other PToV isolates carrying an HE protein belonging to a different lineage. Hence, the specificity of the piglet\u2019s current immune response, its own or maternal, towards one or the other HE lineage at a given time could determine the PToV strain that could infect or prevail in the animal. Our hypothesis is that this PToV lineage alternation could explain the sustainment of both strains on the farm. In fact, even though the P4-like (HE52.11) strain was not found by molecular detection in piglets at the earliest ages [20], the high reactivity observed by ELISA in sows and young piglets and, more remarkably, by the HI in sow A and in 1-, 3- and 7-week old piglets from litter A meant that such a strain was already circulating in the herd from the very beginning of the sampling. Particularly, in piglet 52 the increasing reactivity against both HE proteins from week 3 to week 15 indicates a temporal coexistence of both types of virus in the piglet at around weaning time. The lack of anti-HE maternal antibodies with an HI capacity against either HE protein might have facilitated the establishment of both PToV strains early on in the piglet\u2019s life. Although we described that the two PToV-HE lineages were detected within the same animal at two sequential sampling time points, the lack of detection of PToV-HE52.11 at week 7 could have been due to the low abundance of this virus at the beginning of life, while at later times it became predominant, and therefore easier to detect. Although the shift from PToV-HE52.7 to PToV-HE52.11 in the analyzed animals (Markelo-like to P4-like strains) seems to derive from immune pressure on the latter, the contribution of a potential better viral fitness provided by the former on older pigs\u2019 tissue environments cannot be discarded.",

From this study, where two PToV HE genotypes were found co-existing on the same farm, we can speculate that the specificity of the immune response towards one or the other HE lineage in piglets at a given time could determine the PToV strain that prevailed and spread. However, the potential additional contribution of the immune response to other viral antigens in virus selection also has to be considered. Future studies with higher numbers of animals from different farms will be required to further support the proposed hypothesis.",
