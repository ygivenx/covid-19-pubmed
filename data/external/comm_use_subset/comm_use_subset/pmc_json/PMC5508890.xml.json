Therefore, education plays a key role in raising awareness for infectious diseases and preventing the spread of virus infections.4 A population that is aware of the different ways a virus can be transmitted and does know how to embed effective preventive methods in daily life can protect themselves against virus infections. This principle is based on the knowledge, attitude, behavior (KAB) model, showing that increased knowledge can change people's attitudes and lead to behavioral change.5\u20137",

Following many theories, the likelihood of changing attitude is high in adolescence.8 Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) states with their Health Promoting School Framework that schools are a good environment to start promoting health.9 Five years ago, a consortium of scientists and teachers developed a school-based education module named Viruskenner, regarding virus infections. This module aimed to teach students how to prevent virus infections. The module started with one secondary school in the Netherlands and evolved to a project with eight different secondary schools in the Netherlands. In 2014, the first Surinamese school joined and in 2015 the first Indonesian school. These two countries were already involved with the organizing institute by an international collaboration on emerging infectious disease population studies, facilitating easy communication and logistics. The Viruskenner module was extensively evaluated by independent researchers in the early years of the project. The conclusions of these evaluations led to improvement of the module and the questionnaires used. For example, in 2012, the concept of students being coached by an infectious disease expert was introduced. When becoming an international education module, it was interesting to see the impact of Viruskenner in different countries on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior as they relate to virus infections, and find out which educational factors play a role in these changes.",

Information about the module was disseminated via the project website and the Technasium network coordinator. A control group for the Dutch intervention group was selected at one of the participating Dutch schools. Thus, although they had not opted for the Technasium curriculum, they do have a similar background and social environment. School curricula are defined differently in each country. In the Netherlands, students choose a profile and we defined \u201cnature and science\u201d and \u201cnature and health\u201d as scientific profiles. In Suriname, students can choose biology, and we defined this as a scientific profile. Indonesian students can choose between a social profile (Ilmu Pengetahuan Sosial [IPS]) and a science profile (Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam [IPA]). We defined IPA as a scientific profile. In both Suriname and Indonesia, schools that matched most closely, in terms of grade and education level, with the Dutch intervention group were invited to participate in the study. Of the Dutch schools, two were preuniversity education level (known in the Netherlands as \u201cVWO\u201d) and two were mixed preuniversity education level and advanced general secondary education (known in the Netherlands as \u201cHAVO\u201d). The Surinamese participants were from one VWO school, which is comparable with the Dutch VWO education level. These Surinamese participants can therefore be seen as preuniversity education level.20 The Indonesian participants were from one Sekolah Menengah Atas (SMA) (high school), which is comparable with HAVO in the Netherlands and internationally known as advanced general secondary education.21 The Dutch control group consisted of students with preuniversity education level and advanced general secondary education level.",

By involving students in real-life science-based problems and stimulating active learning (searching for information, test possible solutions and present their idea) a high impact can be achieved.22\u201324 In each country, the 2-month module started with a national opening day, during which all participants of that country were introduced to the field of infectious diseases and viruses by means of four short lectures from experts in the field of virology, public health, and infectious diseases. An optimal learning effect can be reached by bringing students in contact with experts.25 So, in all countries one or two Dutch experts from the department of Viroscience in the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam were assigned to a class to coach them during the project. The students were supposed to work in groups of four to six students in competition with the other groups.22,26 Each group worked on one of the viruses of the subject list including HIV, dengue, hantavirus, chikungunya, MERS coronavirus, HPV, norovirus, viral hepatitis, measles, and influenza. Students developed a prevention tool to disseminate this knowledge among their peers and, in doing so, help prevent virus infections that impact local or global health. During the three national final days (one in each country), the best groups per class, selected by the teachers and coach during a school final, presented their results and final product to their peer students and a jury. This independent jury was selected per country and based on proven expertise in virology, communication strategy, and/or overall creativity. In each country, the jury chose two winners: the most informative presented prevention tool and the most creative prevention tool.",

A team comprising two senior virologists, a communication scientist, and an education expert developed the questionnaire, which was refined after a pilot with a group of 60 students from a school similar to the participating schools. The questionnaires used for the Dutch and Surinamese schools were in Dutch.

This is the most popular type of rotation because it makes the interpretation of the data more reliable and easier.31 One of the behavior items (\u201cI do not use a condom when I have sexual intercourse\u201d) was excluded because of more than 10% missing values. The remaining missing values were randomly spread over the sample population. The sample size was big enough to delete these cases list wise. The Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin (KMO) value is a statistic that measures how much two random variables correlate. A KMO value greater than 0.8 represents a small partial correlation which makes a factor analysis more useful. In this study, the KMO value was 0.849, which means there were relatively compact patterns of correlations and the factor analysis would provide reliable components.32 The number of extracted factors was based on the objective and interpretability criteria mentioned in Sch\u00f6nrock\u2013Adema and others: 1) the screen test, 2) eigenvalues > 1.5, 3) > 5% of the variance explained by all factors, and 4) interpretability. However, the criterion of eigenvalue > 1.5 led to only two components, which was not interpretable. Therefore, we set the norm of an eigenvalue back to greater than one (Kaiser's criterion).33,34 The PCA with varimax rotation finally resulted in four components. The reliability per component was calculated by Cronbach's alpha (Table 1). Internal consistency for the components \u201cattitude and awareness\u201d and \u201cbehavior and life science\u201d was above 0.7 and therefore acceptable. The components \u201cattitude and risk infections\u201d and \u201cbehavior and risk infection\u201d should be interpreted with caution, because of the diversity of the constructs.35",

In Suriname and Indonesia, the project was evaluated with the local organizing teams but not per individual teacher. In the Indonesian and Surinamese culture, hierarchy is strong and extensive evaluation uncommon. Therefore, the teachers preferred a general evaluation with the head of the school.

The Dutch teacher interviews were semistructured and took about 30 minutes each.

The attitude and behavior questions were subdivided into four components by the factor analysis and the mean score per component was calculated. The first component was attitude and awareness and this component represents how aware students are of virus infections and how important they consider them. The second component was attitude and risk infection and this one shows how students evaluate the risk for getting an infection. The third component, behavior and risk infection, showed what students would do in case of a risk for infection.

Participation had a positive effect on attitude and awareness. This effect was higher among females and students who had attained a higher level of education. Knowledge, behavior, and risk infection were higher in female and older students (16+). And while the attitude components increased in the intervention group, the behavior components only showed an increasing trend. There was no significant effect of participation on attitude and risk infection, but there was on behavior and risk infection. This might be explained by the positive effect in the control group for attitude and risk infection but negative for behavior and risk infection.

In Indonesia, this was not possible due to the limited space. The engagement of families could well have had a positive effect. Another striking fact in Indonesia was the relatively high scores for attitude and awareness and behavior, in both pre- and posttests. The same was true for Suriname, which might point to cultural differences with the Netherlands. Collectivistic countries, like Suriname and Indonesia, tend to give more socially desirable answers to questionnaires than individualistic countries like the Netherlands.38 Overall, most students of all countries enjoyed working on the project. Although most outcomes in the intervention group showed a positive trend or change, in the control group knowledge, attitude, and awareness and behavior and risk infection decreased.

Making the results translatable to schools that could participate to the module and would spend at least 4 hours per week during 6 weeks. Due to logistics, randomization of schools was not possible. For a maximum effect, it is important to embed the project in the curriculum, so schools were chosen by a curriculum in which it would fit, as it is in the Netherlands with Technasium. Multiple participating schools per country would have added value as it would have enabled us to perform a proper multilevel analysis, instead of a multiple linear regression analysis. Furthermore, it might be good to measure any balancing measure, for example, the mean grades, to determine whether there are any unanticipated harms to scores on other subjects in school, due to the time the students spent on the project. Although the project is embedded in the curriculum, the harms to other subject would be minimized. The questionnaires were composed with accuracy in Dutch (the national language in the Netherlands as well as in Suriname). The ones that were used in Indonesia were translated to Bahasa Indonesia without back translation. Self-reported questionnaires are useful to measure knowledge changes. However, self-reported attitude and behavior have to be interpreted with caution. The effect was little and could even be due to overestimation. The effect of participation in the module on knowledge, however, was large in two of three countries. Measuring a long-term effect in these countries as well would be of additional value.",

            "text": "According to the available literature, behavior is the most difficult part to measure and improve. Most studies about virus education evaluate HIV prevention programs. Condom use or the intention to use condoms are measured most frequently. In self-reported questionnaires these outcomes improved significantly in some studies, which is promising. However, other studies did not find a significant improvement.10,41,45,47,52 We found two studies, both conducted in Africa, that tested behavioral change based on the prevalence of virus infections. In them, participants' blood samples were tested for HIV and herpes simplex virus antibodies, before and 3\u20138 years after an education module or compared with a control group. However, no significant differences were evident in infection rates.53,54 So what factors play a role in making an educational intervention effective in changing behavior? We found some studies that based their intervention on the Health Promoting School Framework of the WHO proved to be successful in changing health-related behavior.55 Important elements of this framework which were applied in these studies were implementation of the intervention in the school curriculum, involvement of the school environment in the project, and involvement of family and society in the intervention.55,56 The Viruskenner education module was implemented in the Technasium curriculum in the Netherlands, but was not part of the curriculum in Suriname and Indonesia. The family and society were involved in the project, particularly in the Netherlands and Suriname. However, stronger involvement of the school environment and ethos in prevention of infectious diseases might increase the impact of the intervention on attitude and behavior in all countries. This might be reached by additional interventions like handwashing posters in the sanitary facilities or selling machines for mosquito nets in the schoolyard, for example. Knowledge that is not translated into behavior change would not make a difference in numbers of virus infections. So adjustments to the Viruskenner module are needed to have a greater impact on attitude and behavior. Active learning has the best chance of being successful if every individual student participates. Students' families have to be closer involved and a sharper focus on infection prevention in school environments is needed. Increasing knowledge is a great first step, because it correlates with attitude and behavior. However, significant improvements in attitude and behavior must be reached to have a possible impact on infection rates. Therefore, further exploration of contributing elements of education modules that reached behavioral changes would be very useful.",
