Over the last decades, efforts have been exerted to develop strategies for efficient control of them [3\u20135]. Biological and chemical methods have great potential for this purpose. Ningnanmycin is one of the most successfully registered anti-plant viral agent and displayed 56.0% in vivo curative effect at 500 \u03bcg mL-1 [3]. Ribavirin, another widely used plant viral inhibitor, has lower than 50% inhibitory effects at 500 \u03bcg mL-1 [3]. Lower cure rates (30\u201360%) and probably negative effects on environments of these antiviral agents limit their wider applications. Many efforts still have to be done to develop highly efficient and environmentally friendly antiviral agents.",

Moreover, nature-derived plant substances have less negative impact on the environment, as they are readily broken down and have short-lasting residual periods [6, 7]. With the increasing worldwide concern on virus diseases, exploitation of new nature-derived anti-viral agents received increasing attentions.",

In the form of complex mixture, the bioactive compounds may simultaneously function as antiviral activity, dependently or independently with each other, thus reinforcing the inhibiton effect against viruses. Another advantage of mixture of antiviral agents has been discussed by previous researches. One important challenge for any antiviral drugs is the development of resistance by various viruses. In this case, mixture of antiviral compounds is more efficient and practical than the single ones. Because a virus that has developed resistance to a particular drug may not be resistant to other antiviral compounds, which have the potential to possess similar, if not identical, antiviral activities [31].",

In this study, no toxicity was found in tobacco or rice plants. And this acetone extract was slightly toxic to Japanese quail, Daphnia magna, Scenedesmus obliquus and Bombyx mori, and moderately toxic to fish and bees. This environment friendly acetone extract holds potential promise for commecial application in the future. Firstly, from economic considerations, the starting material cottonseed is widely available in China and the cost may be very low. Secondly, cottoseed oil sludge rather than cottonseed oil was served as the raw material, which is the precipitation and enrichment of antiviral effective compounds, so that maximum efforts have been made to improve the concentration of active compounds. Most importantly, the in vivo and field trials demonstrated that this acetone extract was broad-spectrum antiviral, not only against different plant virus (TMV, RSV, SRBSDV), but also more effective in different host varieties from different geographic distributions in China, compared with the commecial agent Ningnanmycin.",
