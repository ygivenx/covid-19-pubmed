For children aged \u22655 years and adults, SARI was defined as a temperature of \u226538.0 \u00b0C and cough with shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with onset in the last 7 days2 [19]. In each country, patients presenting to surveillance facilities and who met the case definitions were eligible; it is only after obtaining verbal consent of the patient (or parent/guardian consent for children) that nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal specimens were collected along with clinical and epidemiological data using a case report form. Specimens and corresponding case report forms were then transported from the sentinel sites to the national influenza reference laboratory where samples were tested for influenza viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), using CDC protocols [20].

There were relatively few samples collected from hospitalized patients with SARI. With few data on hospitalized cases it is difficult to determine risk factors for severe influenza disease, which would help with prioritization of seasonal and pandemic vaccine. Half (4/8) of the countries collected none or less than 50 SARI samples during the 3-year study period. Establishing SARI surveillance has proven to be quite challenging in tertiary hospitals and secondary hospitals as these medical facilities are generally quite understaffed. Medical staffs struggling to provide basic services rarely collect specimens for surveillance purposes. Given budgetary and human resource constraints, having dedicated staff that would focus only or primarily on SARI surveillance and collection of outcome and denominator data may be unrealistic in these facilities without alternative means of support. Integration with other disease surveillance programs is possible, but would require further consideration given the need for laboratory confirmation and stringent handling requirements for virologic specimens.",

Collection of data on ages of all respiratory admissions could improve the understanding of potential biases in existing surveillance. In addition, the few number of elderly enrolled through facility-based surveillance suggest the need to identify surveillance sites that primarily serve adults or the use of community-based surveillance in some settings in order to improve representativeness. Collection of data on other risk factors for severe disease and outcomes of hospitalization (e.g. death, discharge) would also be useful to inform policy decisions. Furthermore, data were collected from health facility-based sentinel surveillance. Persons aged 60 and older are less likely to seek care at health facilities in many parts of Africa which may limit the utility of health facility-based surveillance for monitoring severe disease in this age group [24, 25].",

As influenza transmission varies greatly from year to year, 3 years of data are insufficient to understand nuances of transmission dynamics in the countries we included. Also, not all countries conducted surveillance during the entire time period, which limits interpretation of the percentage positive and may account for the broad range of percent positive by country. Likewise, the individual countries have different climates/\u03bc-climates (coastal, tropical, arid, etc.) that may impact influenza virus circulation. Different case definitions and different sampling methods may have further contributed to the wide range of percent influenza positive by country. Selection bias may have also contributed to the wide range of percent influenza positive by country if clinicians chose to enroll case-patients they suspected of having influenza or to exclude those they thought had a different condition instead of enrolling systematically based upon case definitions. Data on population denominators for surveillance would also help estimate the burden of disease and further inform policy decisions around influenza prevention and control.",
