In the European Union standard dietary Zn levels in feedingstuffs are limited to 150 ppm due to environmental reasons. However, in other countries high levels of in-feed Zn oxide (ZnO, 2,000-3,000 ppm) may be added to the diet of pigs during a restricted period following weaning to prevent post-weaning diarrhea\n[5] as high levels of ZnO have been proven to conserve the intestinal flora during the critical period following the change of diet that place at weaning\n[6]. Despite this effect, the exact mechanisms of ZnO action remain uncertain, and the local or systemic effects of ZnO against specific viral pathogens also remain largely unknown.",

Half of the animals received a single vaccination with an experimental UV-inactivated type I PRRSV (Lelystad virus; LV), since it was shown that a similar vaccination with such a virus in combination with a suitable adjuvant could strongly prime the virus-neutralizing (VN) response and reduce duration of viremia after homologous challenge\n[7]. In contrast to Vanhee et al., we chose a single-vaccination approach and challenge-infected the animals with a heterologous type I PRRSV (95,38% sequence identity for the envelope glycoprotein GP5, which bears a major neutralizing epitope) in order test the influence of elevated Zn levels on an suboptimal antigen stimulus and on cross-protection.",

Piglets were assigned to three different diets (2 pens per diet). At the age of 63 days, the animals receiving the Znhigh diet were switched to the Znmed diet, in order to avoid toxic effects of Zn. One week after commencing the different diets, one pen per diet was chosen randomly and the animals were vaccinated intramuscularly with inactivated LV (accession M96262; kindly provided by Prof. H. Nauwynck (Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium)). Four weeks after vaccination, at the age of 63 days, all pigs were challenged with PRRSV field strain CReSA 3267 (accession JF276435; kindly provided by Prof. J. Segal\u00e9s and Prof. E. Mateu (CReSA, Barcelona, Spain). Animals were infected by intranasal application of 1 ml of virus suspension with a titer of 5 \u00d7 106 TCID50/ml to each nostril using a spray nebulizer.",
