            "text": "Activation and induction of host gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels by virus infection constitute essential steps in host anti-viral response and viral pathogenesis. As one of the major factors that causes tissue damage and viral pathogenesis, induction and over-production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are a common phenomenon in many viral infections [1]\u2013[6]. However, it was frequently observed that the expression of these genes was differentially up-regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels in cells infected with a certain virus. For example, in cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and in sera from SARS patients, significant up-regulation of the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, IL10 and IL12, was reported [5], [7]\u2013[10]. However, only a moderate increase of the expression of these genes at the protein level was detected [8]\u2013[9]. This differential up-regulation of the host gene expression at transcriptional and translational levels may simply reflect the relative capacity of host transcription and translation machinery in the infected cells. Alternatively, it would consist of a convenient and clever viral strategy to counteract host cell anti-viral response, as over-production of these host proteins is usually harmful to viruses. In this study, we show a novel mechanism exploited by coronavirus to regulate the translation of virus-induced genes at late stages of the virus infection cycle.",

Coronavirus is an enveloped virus with a single strand, positive-sense RNA genome of 27\u201332 kb in length. In coronavirus-infected cells, a 3\u2032-coterminal nested set of six to nine mRNA species, including the genome-length mRNA (mRNA1) and five to eight subgenomic mRNA species (mRNA2-9), is expressed. The genome-length mRNA1 encodes two overlapping replicase proteins in the form of polyproteins 1a and 1a/b, which are processed by virus-encoded proteinases into at least 16 putative nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP16) [13]\u2013[15]. The four major structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), are encoded by different subgenomic mRNAs. In addition, several accessory proteins are also encoded by subgenomic mRNAs [15]. In coronavirus-infected cells, no obvious inhibition of host protein synthesis was observed at least at early stages of the virus infection cycle.",

            "text": "Viruses rely on the canonical cellular translation machinery to translate their own RNAs. This would facilitate the rapid production of viral proteins and meanwhile, render inhibitory effect on the production of host proteins including host anti-viral proteins [16]. In fact, viruses may inhibit host protein synthesis by targeting multiple steps in the gene expression process via various vices. For instance, vesicular stomatitis virus M protein inhibits the initiation of transcription of host genes [17]\u2013[20], while adenovirus encodes VA RNA, a small highly structured RNA that competitively binds to the dsRNA-binding site of the double-strand RNA activated kinase (PKR) and prevents its activation [21]. The majority of control over cellular mRNA translation, however, occurs at the initiation stage, the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis for many RNA viruses [22]\u2013[23]. Translation initiation begins with binding of the initiator Met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosomal subunit. This is facilitated by the formation of a eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)/GTP/Met-tRNAi ternary complex and a subsequent 43S preinitiation complex. Viruses could inhibit cellular protein synthesis by targeting and inactivating components of the initiation complex. One well studied example is the picornaviral 2A proteinase which cleaves the initiation factor eIF4G within its N-terminal region containing the binding site for eIF4E and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [24]\u2013[27]. The cleaved C-terminal region of eIF4G could be associated with eIF3 and eFI4A, binds with higher affinity to viral mRNAs and facilitates translation of its own protein [26], [28].",

These interactions led to the inhibition of translation. Interestingly, IBV-infected cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged eIF3f showed much higher translation of IL-6 and IL-8.

            "text": "Virus infection activates transcription and translation of many host genes. During the course of studying the gene expression profiles in cells infected with coronaviruses, it was noted that drastic induction of many virus-inducible genes occurred at the transcriptional level. However, induction of the same genes at the translational level was found to be usually minimal to moderate. To search for cellular proteins that are involved in protein synthesis and may interact with coronavirus proteins, yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out using different coronavirus proteins as baits. This screening led to the identification of eIF3f that could potentially interact with the N-terminal portion (S\u0394C) of the SARS-CoV S protein. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to further test the interaction between S\u0394C and eIF3f. To facilitate detection of the two proteins, S\u0394C was tagged with a Myc tag and eIF3f with a Flag tag at the N-termini, respectively. Analysis of HeLa cells expressing the Myc-tagged S\u0394C either on its own or together with the Flag-tagged eIF3f by Western blot with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody led to efficient detection of the Myc-tagged S\u0394C (Fig. 1a, top panel, lanes 1 and 3). Similarly, analysis of cells expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f either on its own or together with the Myc-tagged S\u0394C by Western blot with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody showed presence of the Flag-tagged eIF3f (Fig. 1a, second panel, lanes 2 and 3). The same cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody. Western blot analysis of the precipitates with anti-Flag antibody detected the Flag-tagged eIF3f expressed either on its own or together with the Myc-tagged S\u0394C (Fig. 1a, third panel, lanes 2 and 3). Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Myc antibody showed presence of the Myc-tagged S\u0394C only in cells co-expressing the two proteins (Fig. 1a, bottom panel, lane 3). These results confirm that the N-terminal portion of the SARS-CoV S protein can indeed interact with eIF3f.",

It was reasoned that in cells transfected with IBV S(EP3), expression of the S protein would be inhibited after the protein synthesis reaches to a certain level, as the S protein already synthesized would bind to eIF3.5, leading to the inhibition of translation and a lower level of S protein synthesis. On the contrary, in cells transfected with IBV S(p65), these initially transfected cells would fuse with the neighboring cells after the S protein expression reaches to a certain level and the eIF3.5 factor present in these neighboring cells would offset the inhibitory effect of the S protein, resulting in a higher level of S protein synthesis. As expected, no cell-cell fusion was observed in cells expressing IBV S(EP3) at 6, to 12 hours post-infection (Fig. 5a). In cells expressing IBV S(p65), small syncytial cells were observed at 8 hours post-infection (Fig. 5a). Giant syncytial cells were observed on almost the whole monolayer at 10 to 12 hours post-infection (Fig. 5a). Western blot analysis showed that slightly more S protein was observed in cells expressing S(EP3) construct at 6 hours post-infected, compared to cells expressing S(p65) construct (Fig. 5b, lanes 1 and 5). At 8 hours post-infection, approximately equal amounts of S protein were detected in cells expressing both constructs (Fig. 5b, lanes 2 and 6). Much more S protein was detected in cells expressing S(p65) than did in cells expressing S(EP3) at 10 and 12 hours post-infection (Fig. 5b, lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8). As a loading control, very similar amounts of the \u03b2-tubulin were detected in samples (Fig. 5b). Analysis of the expression of the two constructs at the mRNA level by realtime RT-PCR showed that very similar amounts of mRNA were detected in cells expressing the two constructs at 6\u201310 hours post-transfection.",

These cytokines and chemokines could promote inflammation by induction of acute cell and tissue injury. Understanding the cellular and viral mechanisms that regulate the induction of these molecules at the transcriptional and translational levels would be essential for understanding the pathogenesis of coronavirus. In this study, the S protein of SARS-CoV and IBV was shown to interact with the initiation factor eIF-3f, leading to the inhibition of general protein synthesis. As the inhibition occurs at late stages of the virus replication cycle, the main effect would be on the translation of virus-induced transcripts, including predominantly proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This inhibition may therefore play an important role in regulation of the pathogenesis of coronavirus.",

The IL-6 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in SARS-CoV-infected dendritic cells [5]. However, only slight increase of IL-6 at the protein level was detected in the serum of SARS patients [9]. In addition, Tseng et al. [34] also reported that IL-6 protein only increased two fold in macrophages and dendritic cells infected SARS-CoV.

            "text": "Is the observed inhibition of translation by the interaction of coronavirus S protein with eIF3f beneficial to the virus? The inhibitory effect appears to be general, as the synthesis of both viral and cellular proteins can be affected. However, as accumulation of the S protein to a certain level in the virus-infected cells is a prerequisite for the inhibition, it would be effective only at late stages of viral infection. This would be largely beneficial to the virus. At this stage, the viral RNA replication and protein synthesis in a given infected cell are nearly complete, inhibition of viral protein synthesis would render little effect on viral production and subsequent infection of neighboring cells. On the contrary, inhibition of host protein synthesis, especially the translation of virus-induced transcripts which are accumulated at very high concentration at this stage, would dramatically reduce the production of protein products from these genes. As most of these products are proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, synthesis and secretion of these products would cause inflammatory response, sensitize the neighboring cells as well as causing cell death. The most direct consequence of these cell/tissue responses would be the limitation and elimination of viral infection. This study therefore reveals a novel viral mechanism that controls the cellular anti-viral response. In fact, infection of cells stably expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f with IBV showed reduced virus production, compared with cells without expression of the protein. It supports that inhibition of the translation of virus-induced transcripts is beneficial to the virus. At present, we could not rule out the possibility that stable expression of the Flag-tagged eIF3f may affect the general translation of host cells, although the cells appear to be normal.",

However, regions with high similarity in the amino acid sequences between the two S proteins were found. For example, the region from amino acids 207\u2013264 of the IBV S protein shares 58.62% amino acid similarity with the region from amino acids 264\u2013321 in the SARS-CoV S protein.

The N-terminal part of the protein is normally not exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membranous compartments of the cell. On the other hand, eIF3f is presumably a protein located mainly in the cytosol and nucleus [35]\u2013[36]. This would prevent or at least reduce the contact between the two proteins. However, immunofluorescent staining of cells expressing the two proteins clearly showed that the SARS-CoV S protein could interact with eIF3f and sequester the later to the site of S protein. It is likely that eIF3f could gain access to the luminal side of the membranous compartments and interact with the S protein. An alternative explanation may lie on the fact that multiple N-terminally truncated forms of the S protein can be detected in cells either infected with SARS-CoV and IBV or transfected with S protein constructs from both viruses (data not shown). As no transmembrane domain in this region, these N-terminally truncated S species may be localized mainly in the cytoplasm and interact with eIF3f.",

Similar observations were also reported in studies of other coronavirus S proteins [37]\u2013[39]. Fusion of the neighboring cells would provide additional fresh eIF3f, which in turn enhances the expression of virus-induced transcripts pre-existed in the originally infected cells. It is therefore likely that inhibition of S protein-mediated fusion may, in addition to the inhibition of virus entry, alleviate the production of pathological cytokines and chemokines, leading to the reduction of cell damage caused by these products during the course of coronavirus infection.

Western blot analysis of the total cell lysates with anti-actin antibodies was included as a loading control (lanes 11 and 12).",
