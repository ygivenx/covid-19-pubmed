            "text": "Vaccines are pharmacological formulations that incorporate the disease-causing agent or an antigen derived from this agent, which are capable of inducing an immune response once administered to a healthy individual, without causing the disease itself. Licensed vaccines can be divided into viral and bacterial vaccines, and viral vaccines can be further classified into four categories: live attenuated viruses, inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, and virus-like particles. For the production of the first two categories, large amounts of viral particles are needed, and most of these viral vaccines are produced by infecting susceptible cell lines. Since there is no standard cell line that can be used for the replication of every virus, a whole panel of different cell lines has been used for vaccine production processes throughout the years. Cell lines that have historically often been used for the production of viral vaccines are MRC-5 and WI-38 [1, 2]. These two cell lines are human diploid cell lines derived from fetuses, and these cells were used for the manufacture of a number of vaccines, for example, hepatitis A, polio, and rubella [3\u20135]. Diploid cell lines have a finite lifespan and in these cell lines the chromosomes are paired. Often these cells retain many characteristics of the cell types from which they originate. The disadvantage of diploid cell lines lies in the fact that the cells can only be cultured for a limited number of passages before the cells die of senescence. In general, diploid cells grow as adherent cells and require serum-containing growth media to grow efficiently. The major benefit of diploid cells is the fact that the cells are nontumorigenic and therefore are considered safe to use for the production of vaccines (reviewed by Hayflick et al. [6]). Given the high demand of vaccines and the restrictions associated with the use of diploid cell lines, in the last decades, continuous cell lines were introduced in vaccine production processes. From a vaccine production point of view, the characteristic of continuous growth is beneficial, since such cells have the potential for an infinite lifespan, and characterized and approved master and working cell banks can be established. A thorough understanding of the cell substrates with respect to identity, stability, purity, tumorigenicity, and the presence of adventitious and endogenous agents is, however, essential for the production of quality assured vaccines [7]. The first continuous cell line approved for the production of vaccines was the Vero cell line, originating from African green monkeys and developed at the Chiba University in Japan. The mechanism of immortalization of Vero cells is unknown. It has been described that Vero cells at passages 140 to 165 are not tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice [8\u201310] and at those passages Vero cells are currently used for the manufacturing of viral vaccines. A recent paper, however, concluded that the transition from nontumorigenic to a tumorigenic phenotype of Vero cells did not occur until passage 185 [11]. Vero cells have, over the years, proven to be safe, since millions of vaccine doses produced on Vero cells have been given to healthy individuals. A major advantage of Vero cells is that the cells are sensitive to infection with many different viruses [12], meaning that Vero cells can be used for the production of a number of different vaccines [13\u201316]. This wide infectivity may be the result of a defective antiviral interferon response of susceptible cells, which was demonstrated in general for cells that are permissive for poliovirus replication [17]. However, not all viruses are capable of replicating on Vero cells and the consensus is that the current repertoire of cell substrates is inadequate for the manufacture of certain types of (new) vaccines. To address this limitation, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee Meeting (VRBPAC) recognized in 2012 that (human) tumor-derived cell lines could be an important addition to the repertoire of cell substrates for the production of viral vaccines (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/BloodVaccinesandOtherBiologics/VaccinesandRelatedBiologicalProductsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM319573.pdf). In some cases, even the only susceptible cell available to propagate specific viruses for which vaccines are needed could be tumor cells. Therefore, currently several tumor cells lines are being explored for their capacity to propagate viral vectors, like the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line [18], HeLa cell line [19, 20], and the PER.C6 cell line of which the latter was immortalized by transfection with adenoviral E1 proteins [21]. At the present time though only a limited number of vaccines that were produced in tumorigenic cell lines have entered clinical trials or were registered [22\u201326].",

This is most likely also due to the development of techniques that can detect adventitious viruses or host cell DNA in vaccines with a very high sensitivity [27]. In the future, a potential use of human tumor cell lines for the production of viral vaccines can be foreseen.",

            "text": "A characteristic of viruses is that viruses evolve, and due to mutations in their genetic material or recombination with other viruses, outbreaks of dangerous and potential lethal new viruses can occur. In these cases, fast development of vaccines is essential for global health. It would be of great importance if cell lines that are needed for the production of such vaccines could be selected upfront, at the start of a viral outbreak, based on scientific understanding instead of trial and error. In this study, we have made a start with the characterization of human tumor cell lines and their capacity to support viral replication. Five human cell lines, capable of growing in suspension and often used in research, but not currently qualified for vaccine production purposes, were selected, HL60, K562, KG1, THP-1, and U937 [28\u201332]. These cell lines are all cancer cell lines and originally derive from patients with leukemia or lymphoma. All different cell lines originate from blood cells that were abrogated in their development at different promonocytic stages. Depending on the mix of cytokines and/or growth factors added to the cells, the cells can differentiate towards several end-stages. Since the stage of differentiation of a cell can have an effect on susceptibility of the cell for replication of specific viruses, this could be an interesting feature of the selected cell lines [33\u201335]. Possibly, the cells can become infected as progenitor cells, whereas infection is not possible when the cells are differentiated or vice versa. Interestingly, K562 cells are currently used as a vaccine for patients with lung cancer. Irradiated K562 cells, transfected with the gene encoding GM-CSF and CD40 ligand, were mixed with allogeneic tumor cells and this vaccine was tested in a phase II trial in lung cancer patients [36].",

After lysis and centrifugation of the cells, half of the supernatant was used for the reinfection of new cells. This procedure was repeated for 4 more times, and virus derived from passage 5 was used for additional experiments. In the samples derived from all 5 passages, the virus titer (CCID50/mL) was determined by a virus titration assay. As shown in Figure 1(a), replication was efficient in the control cell line Vero, grown in serum-free medium, yielding high titers of more than 1 \u00d7 107 CCID50/mL in all 5 passages. In CHO cells, Sabin poliovirus type 1 could only be detected in the first passage, and this is most likely due to the fact that cells were not washed after primary infection, suggesting that the virus titer is the result of virus that remained present in the culture medium, which was unable to infect the cells. In samples from passages 2\u20135 of Sabin poliovirus type 1 added to CHO cells, as expected no virus could be detected. A comparable pattern was observed after infection of THP-1 and HL60 cells with Sabin poliovirus type 1, suggesting that these two cell lines were refractory for the virus. The K562 and U937 cell lines were highly permissive for Sabin poliovirus type 1, resulting in high virus titers in all 5 viral passages. KG1 cells were also fully permissive for Sabin poliovirus type 1, but the amount of virus obtained after infection of KG1 cells was slightly lower compared to Sabin poliovirus type 1 that replicated in the other permissive cell lines. Microscopically it was observed that U937 cells infected with virus from passages 0\u20132 did not show clear cytopathic effects (cpe) after 6 days of culture, whereas cells infected with virus from passages 3, 4, and 5 were harvested after 3 days because full cpe was observed. A photographic overview of cells infected with virus from passage 4 is shown in Figure 1(b). Also, in K562 cells, clear cpe was visible at day 6 after infection. The amount of virus produced after replication of Sabin poliovirus type 1 in K562 cells did seem to increase after the first passage, suggesting that replication of the passaged virus is more efficient than replication of the parental virus.",

Sabin poliovirus type 1 from the original stock (passage 0) was compared with the passaged virus (passage 5). In Figure 3 it can be seen that the titers in the supernatant are comparable between the parental and the passaged viruses in Vero, U937 and K562 cells, whereas in KG1 cells the passaged virus induced higher titers at days 1 and 2 after infection while the original virus needed 4 days to achieve comparable titers in the supernatant. This suggests that the virus passaged in the KG1 cells had an enhanced replication speed. In Vero, K562, and U937 cells a trend is observed that the virus titer in the supernatant at day 1 is slightly higher if cells are infected with the passaged virus compared to control virus, although the differences are not significant.

            "text": "High vaccination rates have helped to prevent many infectious diseases and resulted in less sickness and millions of lives saved (reviewed by Rappuoli et al.) [38]. Among the greatest success stories are the eradication of smallpox virus, rinderpest, and the polio eradication program, where poliovirus type 2 was already eradicated in 1999 [39\u201341]. Complete eradication of poliovirus is, however, more difficult than what has been initially anticipated, because of persistence of wild type poliovirus transmission and recurring outbreaks in polio-free countries (reviewed by Wassilak et al.) [42]. The capacity to develop vaccines that induce efficient immune responses in a short period of time, together with a large global immunization rate, is thus essential to prevent viral outbreaks or further spread of viruses. In the last decades, many different cell lines have been used in vaccine production processes, and new cell lines are still being developed. Since regulatory views are changing with respect to the risks and benefits of cell lines (reviewed by Hess et al.) [7], it is important to compare different cell lines for their capacity to propagate specific viruses. With such an approach, using viruses that belong to different viral groups, it might be possible in the future to select producer cell lines based upon scientific understanding instead of trial and error, and timelines needed to produce viral vaccines might be shortened. In this study, we performed a first step for such a comparison, with a focus on human suspension cell lines. These cell lines have an infinite lifespan and this, together with the fact that these cells grow in suspension, could facilitate vaccine production processes. All cell lines described in this study have been used extensively in experimental research. The disadvantage of these cell lines, obviously, is that these cell lines consist of tumor cells that are grown in serum-containing medium and are currently thus not qualified as suitable vaccine substrates. However, with changing regulatory opinions, it is foreseen that continuous cell lines will be accepted for the production of viral vaccines in the (near) future. Until then, studies, like this, can be used to gain knowledge about the interaction of cell lines with viruses and/or the development of new producer cell lines that are approved for the production of viral vaccines.",

K562, KG1, and U937 cell lines appeared to be capable of supporting replication of Sabin poliovirus type 1, whereas HL60 and THP-1 were not. All five cell lines did express CD155, the receptor for poliovirus entry. This means that receptor expression does not predict the capacity of a virus to replicate in a cell. Possible explanations for the lack of replication in the CD155 expressing HL60 and THP-1 cells could be that (i) CD155 expressed on these cell lines is nonfunctional, (ii) the nonsusceptible cell lines lack the expression of a coreceptor on the cellular membrane, or (iii) HL60 and THP-1 express an intracellular viral restriction factor. Since the tested cell lines have the capacity to differentiate towards several end-stages and it has been shown for other viruses that the differentiation stage of a cell can affect the susceptibility for a virus [33\u201335], it would also be interesting to determine permissiveness of HL60 and THP-1 for Sabin type 1 after differentiation of the cells towards different end-stages.",

Compared to HeLa cells, poliovirus replicated less efficiently in both K562 and U937 cells yielding a 20-fold and a 50-fold reduced virus output. Finally, a study by Benton et al. showed differences between K562 clones in their response to poliovirus infection, because two out of four K562 cell lines were killed by the poliovirus, whereas in the two other cell lines persistent infections were established [48]. In our study, we did not observe a persistent infection of K562 cells, nor that the poliovirus replicated less efficiently in U937 cells or the less-differentiated K562 cells. The discrepancies between the observed replication characteristics in these studies with our study could possibly be explained by the fact that in our study the replication characteristics of passaged Sabin type 1 were studied, meaning that the virus has had 5 passages to adapt to the new cell line. We did, however, observe already after the first passage of Sabin type 1 in K562 or U937 cells a high virus titer. This was the amount of virus present in culture medium together with the virus in the cellular lysates, so the majority of the detected virus could have still been present in the cellular fraction, whereas the other studies determined the amount of virus present in the culture medium only. Another difference between these studies was that Benton et al. and Lopez-Guerrera et al. used Mahoney strain of type 1 poliovirus, and in our study attenuated Sabin poliovirus type 1 was used.",

            "text": "In two more recent papers, the replication capacity of Sabin types 1, 2, and 3 or wild type polioviruses was studied on a panel of different suspension cell lines, deriving from humans, avians, or canines. In both studies the virus was not adapted to the new cell lines, but experiments were directly performed with virus produced on Vero cells. Vlecken et al. compared a number of adherent and suspension cell lines for the capacity to replicate Sabin poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3. Of the 5 cell lines tested (BHK-21, CHO-K1, CAP, sMDCK, and AGE1.CR.HS), only the CAP cell line was capable of propagating Sabin type polioviruses, whereas all the other suspension cell lines were not capable of supporting viral replication [49]. In the second study, published by Sanders et al., the capacity of PER.C6 to support replication of Brunenders, MEF-1, and Saukett poliovirus was determined in comparison to Vero cells [50]. PER.C6 is an immortalized human cell line capable of supporting the replication of a number of viruses, like influenza virus and West Nile virus [51, 52]. The poliovirus was capable of replicating efficiently in the PER.C6 cell line, resulting in a high virus yield, which can be attributed to the fact that PER.C6 cells can be cultured under optimized conditions to very high cell densities. Altogether, these two studies suggest that, for efficient replication of poliovirus, human or primate cells are needed, since, also in the adherent cell lines tested by Vlecken et al., viral replication was not observed in cell lines with another origin [49]. This observation underscores the need of a wider panel of human/primate cell lines for the production of viral vaccines for human diseases. In our study, we have identified three additional cell lines that are susceptible for infection and replication of poliovirus that can also be grown at a larger scale in a disposable bioreactor system (only tested for K562 cells). It is important to realize that, by passaging a virus on a new cell line, the virus can adapt to this new cell line to optimize its replication cycle. This can also be accompanied by changes in antigenicity or virulence of the adapted virus. A new combination of cell line and virus should thus always be analyzed thoroughly, before the new cell line can be used for the production of viral vaccines. In this study, we did observe a difference in replication speed between original virus and virus passaged on KG1 cells, but sequencing is needed to determine whether the virus truly adapted to the cell line.",

All five human hematopoietic cell lines expressed CD155, which thus did not explain susceptibility to viral replication, although we did not study the functionality of CD155. Furthermore, we have shown that in KG1 cells the passaged Sabin poliovirus type 1 replicated more rapidly than the control virus. Infection of K562, KG1, and U937 at an MOI of 0.01 resulted in a high viral titer in the culture medium after 4 days. Also, K562 cells grown and infected with adapted Sabin poliovirus type 1 in a disposable bioreactor system yielded high viral titers in the culture medium. Altogether, it is concluded that K562, KG1, and U937 cell lines can be used for the propagation of poliovirus and in follow-up studies the capacity of other (entero)viruses to replicate in these cell lines will be determined.",
