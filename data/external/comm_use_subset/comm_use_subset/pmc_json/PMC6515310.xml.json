Within industrialized nations there is a challenge of increasing demand, typically arising from an aging population, rising costs and decreasing resources. Within Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) there is an enormous lack of resources. Here disruptive innovations may have the potential to improve health outcomes, lower costs and improve access.

The need for POCT for the early identification and management of sepsis is particularly important since this is difficult to diagnose and the mortality increases by an average of 8% for every undiagnosed hour [3]. In the hospital setting, various tests and investigations are undertaken when suspecting sepsis in both adults and children: these include vital signs checks (observations of temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry oxygen saturation, heart rate and responsiveness). A full set of routine blood tests can include blood count, a chemistry profile including urea and electrolytes, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and glucose, and a coagulation screen. More than 170 biomarkers have been reported in the literature for the diagnosis of sepsis. However, only the most common biomarkers, such as CRP or procalcitonine, can typically be analysed within centralised hospital laboratories. The testing of the other biomarkers typically requires more specialised laboratories. Other tests can include arterial or venous blood gas samples, urine output recorded and urine sample dipstick test and microbiological culture, aerobic and anaerobic microbiological blood cultures, swab of suspected wound or respiratory tract/gynaecological swabs, chest radiograph.",

Results may be published to patient\u2019s electronic records as soon as possible. Some of the requested tests may be marked urgent or routine, as necessary. Bedside glucose tests, vital signs temperature probe, pulse oximetry or electronic blood pressure cuffs will often provide immediate results. Arterial or venous blood gas samples can be difficult to acquire if there is difficulty with gaining vessel access (sometimes alternative sampling techniques including femoral stab, or ultrasound-guided sampling is necessary). The local availability of analysers can, however, lead to results within minutes, including true oxygen and carbon dioxide saturations, pH, lactate and Electrolyte levels. Similarly urine samples may be tested with a dipstick for common abnormalities (protein, leukocytes, blood, glucose, nitrates), or urine test for pregnancy, prior to being sent for full investigation in the laboratory. Blood or swab cultures taken will require 5\u201310 days incubation; growth of any organisms and their sensitivities/resistance to various antibiotics will guide management and assist in identifying appropriate treatment(s). Currently, certain patients found to be positive with or exposed to certain microorganisms (\u2019superbugs\u2019) may need more treatments by nursing staff to improve sanitation or nursing in isolation; examples include patients positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), among others.",

Although STIs are not normally fatal they do represent a significant burden of diseases and they can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. STIs can increase infectiousness of a susceptibility to HIV and in pregnancy they can cause fetal or neonatal death. Chlamydia is globally the most common bacterial STI and causes reproductive complications in women. The LMICs and LDCs have the majority of global incidents of STIs, but the health systems are less well resourced to manage these. POCT could play an important role in supporting the management of conditions for individual patients and also provide wider control of STIs within developed countries, LMICs and LDCs.",

This can have a transformative role in the treatments administered, constituting one step further in the path of personalised medicine.

Also, it would be beneficial to determine whether a pneumonia was Community-acquired or Hospital-acquired (there are cases where this is still unclear): this can have a large impact on treatment regimen. If Hospital-acquired, then treatment with intravenous antibiotics initially is more beneficial. RTIs are the most common infections encountered within primary care and there is evidence that people presenting with acute uncomplicated RTIs will commonly receive antibiotics despite most RTIs being viral [8]. There is therefore a clear need for POCT that can differentiate RTIs within primary care and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing as part of AMR stewardship.",

The key cancer and cardiac biomarkers, as well as their normal values in blood, are given in Table 1. PSA is the most common tumour marker for prostate cancer. IL-6, an interleukin, is overexpressed in several different cancers including prostate cancer, as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The interleukins are part of the cytokine family and more generally play an important role in the inflammatory response of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The MMP family are part of the zinc-dependent endopeptidases, where MMP-2 is key in tumour growth, invasion and metastasis and MMP-3 is used to diagnose and monitor diseases such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and adrenal tumours. The alpha-fetoprotein, an oncofetal glycoprotein, is the most important for liver cancer tumour marker. CEA, a glycoprotein, is raised with inflammation or tumours in any endodermal tissue, including the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, pancreas and breast, and can be used for diagnosis of lung cancer, ovarian carcinoma and breast cancer.

More recent developments are focused toward automating and miniaturizing the traditional biochemical assays, such as enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to increase their applicability and accessibility [11].",

The 96-well plate (well volume 530 \u03bcL) is fairly ubiquitous and the 384-well plate (well volume 149 \u03bcL) is common. There is a trend towards higher-density, lower-volume well plates (with the 1536 well plates having a volume of 10 \u03bcL). The smaller volumes are crucial because they allow a lower volume of sample, solvents and reagents which greatly reduces the cost of the assay. The most commonly used immuno-assay format is the ELISA, which typically captures an analyte (antigen) between two antibodies and upon which, one antibody is labelled with an enzyme. The enzyme enables a signal enhancement by a factor of 100,000 by converting a substrate into a detectable signal. For signal generation, the substrate can be converted either into an absorbing dye (detected by absorption of transmitted light), into a fluorescent dye (detected via a fluorescence reader) or into a light emitting reaction (detected as luminescence). Fluorescence and luminescence are more sensitive as compared with absorbance but are also more expensive and can involve more complex protocols. The choice of approach for signal generation and detection is therefore generally dependent on the sensitivity and cost requirements.",

The demand for portable diagnostics is, however, that they should be fast, reproducible and are able to be operated by untrained users. Lateral flow assays are widely used as a robust, simple and low cost analytical assay. They are most commonly used for simple Yes/No answers such as testing pregnancy or drug abuse in a qualitative or semi-quantitative manner. There is now greater effort in the development of quantitative lateral flow assays. Lateral flow assays typically use antibody coated microparticles, which bind the analyte directly from the sample and are then enriched via binding against a second antibody in a target zone. This obviates the need for complex and costly enzymatic signal enhancement used within microplate ELISA.",

            "text": "After the lateral-flow assays, simple electrochemical enzymatic assays are the most commonly used for quantification of small molecules, which can be detected quantitatively in redox-reactions. The most widely used application for these has been blood glucose monitoring for diabetes with a glucose oxidase enzyme acting as a catalyst for the conversion of a glucose substrate to a gluconolactone product and with amperometric detection [12,13]. More recently, there has been increasing interest in the use of impedimetric sensing as a label-free approach for monitoring ligand receptor binding [14,15]. Use of a label on a biomolecule has the drawback of altering the binding properties of the biomolecule. A label can allow higher sensitivity and or selectivity but this is typically at the expense of additional cost, time and sample handling. Impedimetric sensing is intermediate between equilibrium and dynamic electrochemical methods. In an equilibrium method such as potentiometry, there is no current flow and the cell potential is related to the concentration of the analyte. In a dynamic method such as voltammetry, the potential is controlled and the current is measured as a function of the potential. In impedimetric analysis, a small ac potential is applied, superimposed on a preset or offset voltage and, the time dependent current is measured which allows calculation of the impedance. In dynamic methods, a current is allowed to flow and so there is a change in the sample constituents, which is not the case for equilibrium measurements. In impedimetric measurements a small current is allowed to flow, but this is then quickly reversed so that there are no significant changes in the sample. Impedance sensing is typically carried out using interdigitated electrodes where the electrode width and separation determines the penetration depth of the electric field. When a ligand binds to a receptor, the change in the electric properties leads to a change in the impedance which provides a direct electrical signal for the binding event. A key advantage is that the electrode configuration can be designed such that the electrodes scan just above the electrode surface to the depth of the bound ligand-receptor, which would then minimise any interferences from the bulk of the solution [16]. Impedimetric sensing is also attractive since micro and nanofabrication techniques would allow development of the miniaturised transducers in a convenient manner. The potential of fabricating an impedimetric array in a polymer microfluidic cartridge has been demonstrated as a potential aid for diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE) and towards low cost point-of-care diagnostics [17] An impedimetric array within a microfluidic cartridge could allow multiple measurements of a single biomarker or alternatively measurements of multiple biomarkers within the same microfluidic cartridge.",

In CEAS, high sensitivity is achieved through increasing the pathlength by locating the sample between two highly reflective dielectric mirrors. The light reflects between the two mirrors to form an optical cavity which magnifies the optical absorption effect. A very small amount of light exits from the mirror and this is measured to give the CEAS signal [28,29]. The CEAS technique has the potential to approach the sensitivity of fluorescence based detection but with the advantages of lower reader cost, due to fewer optical elements\u2014and being label-free. Overall, CEAS offers the potential for higher sensitivity; wider applicability; less complex assay protocols with the associated lower assay costs; and potentially no interference of the native ligand receptor binding arising from a label. Early studies using a low cost visible light-emitting diode (LED) as a light source and a 2-mm cuvette using a range of samples at visible wavelengths showed a 50-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to conventional single pass uv-visible spectroscopy [30]. Subsequent work demonstrated that CEAS could be used as a detector for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measurements. This involved placing a HPLC flow cell (70 microlitre) into an optical cavity. A 50\u201370-fold improved sensitivity was demonstrated over a conventional HPLC instrument [31]. A 39-fold increase in sensitivity has been demonstrated for a 96 well microtiter plate commercially available osteocalcin ELISA and a 115-fold increase in sensitivity for a commonly used ELISA colorimetric reaction of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (STREP-HRP) with Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) [32].

Similarly, a method has been reported to use the reduction of silver ions onto gold nanoparticles to amplify the signal originating from immunosandwich for the simultaneous and rapid diagnosis of HIV and syphilis [34]. This technique was able to measure very low concentrations, as low as 1 Ag/mL. Photonic crystal gratings are proposed as a new sensor for biosensing applications [37]. The resonance characteristic of photonic crystal gratings is sensitive to small changes in dielectric permittivity caused by biomarker bindings (Figure 1). Combining the photonic crystal grating with an immunoassay, C-reactive protein, which is produced in the presence of inflammation, can be detected at a detection limit of 12.24 pg/mL [38]. Multiplexed sensors can diagnose more than one infectious disease by detecting various biomarkers. An electrophotonic sensor was able to profile biomarkers by combining electrochemical and photonic characterization [39]. Using the selective chemical functionalization, the electrophotonic sensor array can identify different binding events. A barcoded paper-based analytical device was used to show a multiplexed detection of eight antigen types using lateral flow [40].",

With the advent of the measurement/sensing technologies that provided the ability of detecting trace substances in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid in vitro Diagnostics (IVD) have become a cornerstone of clinical practice. Solid phase immuno-assays such as ELISA [41] have long been established and are used extensively for diagnosis. The vast majority of sensing technologies used for molecular diagnostics are ensemble measurements, in other words they are analog. These immuno-assays have sensitivities in the picomolar range [42]. However, the serum concentrations of most protein biomarkers in the early stages of infection [43] are in the femtomolar range. To achieve the desired 3-order-of-magnitude improvement, a new class of biological sensing technologies have emerged relying on single molecule counting or digital detection, an approach that provides resolution and sensitivity not obtainable with ensemble measurements. Digital detection is a disruptive technology that can provide the necessary improvement in sensitivity. Furthermore, it is much easier to measure the presence or absence of signal than to detect the absolute amount of signal as it has long been recognized in communications and data recording. The advent of digital audio recording simplified the requirements of readout and allowed for reproduction of highest quality music without the expensive Hi-Fi equipment. Similarly, digital detection may lead to the most advanced disease diagnostic tools to become available at a low cost and at the point-of-need.",

Among these sample compartmentalization techniques, the most notable one is digital PCR [45]. Solid phase and microarray-based techniques have the promise of low-cost and point-of-need operation. DNA and protein microarrays are high-throughput and allow the simultaneous quantification of tens of thousands of different biomolecules. Their sensitivity, however, is often insufficient as a reliable diagnostic tool. This practical limit is not imposed by the microarray format itself, but rather the sensitivity of conventional methods involving fluorophores as labels and fluorescence readers. Recent advances with Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensors (IRIS) [46] show their ability to detect single nanoscale particles by enhancing the elastic optical scattering signatures in a wide-field optical imaging format [47]. In single-particle modality of IRIS (SP-IRIS), the interference of light reflected from the sensor surface is modified by the presence of particles producing a distinct signal that reveals the size of the particle. Identification of virus particles in complex samples in multiplexed format have been demonstrated [48]. Size discrimination of the imaged nanoparticles (virions) allows differentiation between modified viruses with different genome lengths and, facilitates a reduction in the counting of non-specifically bound particles. This technique has been adapted to a closed-system to allow real-time particle detection in complex mixtures [49]. For this application to detect viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, biosafety was achieved by having a sealable sample addition port. The platform demonstrated capability of identifying virus binding in a 20-min experiment. Sensitivity for this rapid test was comparable to laboratory-based assays such as ELISA and plaque assay. These results demonstrate a digital detection platform that has promise for rapid, multiplexed, sample-to-answer diagnostic technology.",

SP-IRIS can detect Au nanoparticles as small as 20 nm, which is only about twice the hydrodynamic diameter of an antibody, allowing this information to serve as an identifier of the biomolecule attached to the nanoparticle. Using this approach, the detection of protein biomarker, \u03b2-lactoglobulin, has been demonstrated in unprocessed serum and human whole blood with detection limits of respectively 60 aM and 500 aM. Direct detection of protein biomarkers with attomolar sensitivity without the need for sample preparation can allow performing diagnostic tests at the point of care. Quantitation of allergen-specific IgE from unprocessed finger-prick volume of human blood has also been shown [51]. More recently, development of a digital microarray has been reported using functionalized gold nanorods as single-molecule labels and an interferometric scanner, which can rapidly enumerate individual nanorods by imaging them with a 10\u00d7 objective lens [52]. By combining single-nanoparticle enumeration and ensemble measurements of spots when the particles are very dense, this system achieves a dynamic range of about 6 order-of-magnitude directly from a single scan. As a proof-of-concept a digital protein microarray assay has been demonstrated for detection of hepatitis B virus surface antigen in buffer with a limit of detection of 3.2 pg/mL. More broadly, the technique\u2019s simplicity and high-throughput nature make digital microarrays a flexible platform technology with a wide-range of potential applications in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics [52].",

Despite the potential for very high sensitivity demonstrated by SP-IRIS in a simple and inexpensive microarray format, the robustness of the image acquisition and particle-counting software has been a major challenge. Key challenges in translating SP-IRIS (from a laboratory instrument requiring manual operation by a skilled operator to an automated tool for diagnostic applications) includes stringent calibration and characterization requirements. As a first step, it is crucial to develop a robust image acquisition and analysis technique. It has been discovered that the change in intensity varies for the signature of a nanoparticle over the focal plane, or differential intensity is considerably more predictable than its specific appearance in any single image. Thus, the nanoparticle response generated by the calculation of differential intensity collapses into a consistent profile, enabling the use of simple template matching methods. As illustrated in Figure 3, an algorithm has been developed for the robust measurement of the concentration of surface-bound nanoparticle populations, regardless of heterogeneity in size and axial offset [53].",

Infrared cameras operate using the same mechanism as visible light cameras, with the key difference being that the photo-sensors are made sensitive to infrared light (longer wavelength).

In MEMS microphones, a suspended micro-structure deflects as a function of the amplitude and frequency (pitch) of incoming acoustic pressure waves. This deflection is then converted to an electric signal using either capacitive or piezoelectric transduction. The airflow into and out of the respiratory system generates acoustic waves that can be detected by mobile phone microphones making the respiratory track a test subject for this class of point-of-care systems. An example of such a system correlates the spectrum of respiration sound to flow rate of air, which can then be used for diagnosis of respiratory conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis [61]. Quality of measurement is heavily reliant on signal processing techniques to reduce the effects of environmental noise and dependence on microphone distance. Goel et al. (2016) [62] improved the accuracy of air flow rate measurement using a whistle that changes in pitch as a function of flow rate in combination with a mobile phone microphone. Improved mobile phone communication technology and infrastructure has made it possible for fast, reliable, secure, accessible data transfer between mobile phone-based point-of-care systems and the network. At its most basic form, communication between mobile phone-based point-of-care systems and the network, enables transmission of the findings. However, given the reality of current 4G and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and next generation 5G connectivity, mobile phone-based point-of-care systems are no longer limited to the in-built mobile phone data processing and storage capabilities. They have near real-time access to the significantly larger computational and data storage capacity of remote servers. In addition to the above functionalities, mobile phones offer researchers a sophisticated and accessible hardware platform for software implementation, user interaction and an energy source for low power point-of-care systems.",

Once amplification is completed, blue LEDs excite the samples and the resulting fluorescent emission signals are measured using a mobile phone camera.

The detection of serum ferritin (a biomarker for Iron deficiency) has been demonstrated by placing a drop of blood on a disposable AuNP labeled LFA and feeding this into a phone accessory. This was possible by suppression of ambient light, uniform illumination from LEDs, focused images of the test, and capturing of images which are then processed via mobile application [73]. Human trial results of this configuration has demonstrated that the approach is consistent with the laboratory standards for detection of serum ferritin. A smartphone integrated instrument for performing transmission, reflection, and intensity spectroscopy has been demonstrated for detection of biomarkers related to pre-term birth in pregnant women and phenylketonuria [74]. This approach uses: two light sources (white from phone LED and green from a laser diode) for illuminating liquid samples; fiber optics and mirrors for guiding optical beams; and a diffraction grating coupled with the phone camera for generating spectra from recorded images and videos, all of which are mounted on a 3D printed cradle and costing approximately $550. Different samples are placed into liquid compartments of a microfluidic cartridge and the cartridge is swiped through an opening in the cradle while the spectra of each sample are measured through processing the recorded video from a smartphone camera. The developed system demonstrated comparable results to that of a clinic grade instrument and it offers the possibility of multiple and rapid measurement of a wide array of samples.",

This degree of complexity creates challenges for patients, physicians, and researchers that cannot be adequately tackled by the traditional usage of paper records and archives.

These standards can be broadly categorized into medical standardization and technical standardization. Medical standardization is the employment of universally accepted medical terms, abbreviations, writing format, etc. Standardization of medical concepts and procedures enables improved performance of medical professionals in transfer, referral, and supportive care of patients [82]. A major effort in creating a standard definition of medical concepts and procedures was conducted by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and resulted in the creation of the System of Concepts to Support Continuity of Care, commonly referred to as ContSys (EN ISO 13940n). In a more targeted approach, the World Health Organization (WHO) has created a medical classification list that assigns codes to diseases, signs and symptoms, etc. The latest edition, ICD-10, contains more than 14,400 unique codes. This coding system is primarily intended to facilitate statistical international health surveys [82]. Technical standardization is the employment of software and hardware protocols and practices which enable the easy cross-system transfer and access of medical data. Transfer of data between medical facilities that may or may not be part of the same EHR system requires the establishment of standard protocols for communication, messaging, data structures, privacy, and security [82]. To meet these needs, various organizations have proposed different hardware and software standards for EHR systems. The international Organization for Standardization (ISO) has proposed the adoption of ISO/TS 18308 for EHR systems. Key features include interoperability with other EHR systems, storage of both structured and unstructured data, cross-software and hardware platform compatibility, storage of both administrative and clinical data, possibility of translation of stored information to different languages, and reliability data storage. In addition, ISO/TS 18308 mandates recording the chronology of actions by users as means of accountability and requires measures to ensure security and privacy by mandating user identification and different levels of access among other measures.",

Practical decision-making tasks in the context of point-of-care diagnostics can be supported by recent AI/machine learning techniques. In particular, supervised machine learning provides statistical decision models for classification problems, i.e., identifying to which set of known categories (classes) a new observation belongs. The decision model is learned by using training data that are labeled a priori with the true class membership. In the following paragraphs, we give a brief introduction to machine learning techniques. Concrete application scenarios and case studies will be discussed in the next subsections. Formally, patterns (objects) to be classified are typically represented by vectors of features. Given the feature space \u211cd (i.e., d features), the classifier is defined as a mapping function h:\u211cd\u2192C, where C={C1,C2,\u2026,CK} is the set of K pre-specified classes. Machine learning methods use a training set {(x1,y1),(x2,y2),\u2026,(xn,yn)} to automatically learn a classification model h, where each training sample xi\u2208\u211cd is associated with a class label yi\u2208C,i=1,2,\u2026,n. Machine learning has a long history and remains a vivid research field, providing a vast number of powerful classification methods [83,84]. The standard pipeline for pattern classification is to represent patterns in terms of features and then apply a suitable classification method. The most popular classification methods include the simple k\u2013nearest-neighbor rule, linear discriminant function, Bayes classification, decision tree, support vector machine, and the family of deep learning (neural networks).",

Generally, each classification method has its advantages and disadvantages for a particular use case. Therefore, combining multiple classification methods can help to compensate the erroneous decisions of one classifier by other classifiers. Practically, such ensemble methods turn out to be an effective means of improving the classification performance in many applications [86,87]. A prominent representative of ensemble classification is the random forest approach [88], which uses a decision tree as the base classifier and has demonstrated superior performance in many fields, in particular in computer vision [89]. For instance, the highly successful system for real-time human pose recognition built in Microsoft\u2019s Xbox [90] is based on this approach.",

The recent development of deep learning [91,92,93] is currently very promising on automatic feature learning. In fact, a hierarchy of features can be learned to build representations of patterns with multiple levels of abstraction. For understanding images, for instance, the first layer typically learns low-level features like edges in the image. The second layer detects middle-level motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges. Then, the next layer may assemble motifs into larger combinations that correspond to object parts, and subsequent layers would detect objects as combinations of these parts. Importantly, these layers of features are not designed by engineers, but learned instead from data using a learning procedure. In essence, deep learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation.",

One important further development is to augment these networks with an explicit memory, e.g., by means of the long short-term memory (LSTM) [97] that uses special hidden units, the natural behaviour of which is to remember inputs for a long time.

One example is the issue with meager amounts of data, where automatic approaches suffer with insufficient training samples. When dealing with rare events (e.g., rare diseases [114]) we are confronted with the problem of class imbalance [115]. In that case, one class represents a circumscribed concept, while the other class represents its counterpart. Consequently, samples from the counterpart class heavily outnumber samples from the positive class. This is, inherently, the case in data sets regarding rare diseases, because there is a large number of patients who do not have that disease [116]. In addition, automatic \u201cblack-box\u201d approaches are lacking explicit declarative knowledge representation. Therefore, they have difficulty in generating the required underlying explanatory structures, which are needed for the interpretation of the machine learning results [117]. The absence of explanatory capabilities\u2014particularly in deep learning neural networks\u2014limits the full potential of such systems [118,119].

Under the hypothesis that machine learning techniques can contribute to identify genetic variations in rapidly evolving pathogens, Holman and Gabuzda [126] developed an machine learning pipeline that uses amino acid signatures in the HIV viral envelop together with a C4.5 decision tree and the PART rule-learning engine to analyze the genetics of rapidly evolving pathogens.

Rapidly deployable, mobile labs [134] and handheld sensor units can provide rapid pathogen identification and confirmation. Connecting results from a wide array of these tests with geospatial information could enable more rapid outbreak detection and a more effective public health response. Such a network of sensors could complement developing national biosurveillance systems [135] and provide a platform for coordinated international response to emerging biothreats. Miniaturised sensing systems that use or connect to a smartphone are of particular interest, as they may be widely deployed and be more broadly integrated into disease-monitoring networks [68]. Analytical techniques that may be integrated with a smartphone analyzer include nucleotide-based detection strategies (PCR, LAMP) [136,137,138] and antibody-based detection (lateral flow, acoustic wave, or other immunoassay approaches) [2,139,140,141]. While these approaches generally require prior knowledge of the pathogen of interest, assay multiplexing is becoming increasingly feasible [140]. Additionally, portable mass spectrometry and miniaturized sequencing strategies may soon enable portable, novel pathogen detection. In addition to providing pathogen identification or confirmation, portable analytical strategies have recently been combined with rapid incubation or culture methods to provide antibiotic resistance information in as few as 30 min [142]. Rapid detection of developing antibiotic resistance though networked sensors could help ensure proper initial treatment and containment in an epidemic.",

Panel (b) shows that the authors initially established the genomic surveillance laboratory in Donka Hospital, Conakry. Panel (c) is used to indicate that they later moved the laboratory to a dedicated sequencing laboratory in Coyah prefecture. Panel (d) shows an image of the room inside this laboratory where they separated the sequencing instruments (left side) from the PCR bench (right side). Power to the thermocycler was provided by an un-interruptable power supply, which can be observed in the middle of the room. (Photos were taken by Josh Quick and Sophie Duraffour.)
