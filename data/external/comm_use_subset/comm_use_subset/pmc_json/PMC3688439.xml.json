Only 5 pts had received influenza vaccination. 29 cases were community-acquired (85%) while 5 were hospital-acquired (15%) (symptoms occurring >3 days [d] after admission). No ICU-acquired influenza was detected. 9 pts (26%) had a documented co-infection with: S. pneumonia (n=5), S. pyogenes (n=2), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (n=1) and Coronavirus (n=1). 27 pts (79%) were treated with oseltamivir, with a median delay after onset of symptoms of 5 d (IQR: 3-7). 27 pts (79%) needed ventilatory support: invasive ventilation (n=17 [50%] for a median duration of 6 d [IQR: 2-13]) or non-invasive ventilation (n=15 [44%] for a median duration of 2 d [IQR: 2-3]). The median length of ICU and hospital stay were 5 (IQR: 3-9) and 11 d (IQR: 7-23), respectively. 5 pts (19%) died of influenza-related complications, including 1 case of nosocomial superinfection.",
