            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease dependent on multiple interacting environmental and genetic factors, making it difficult to understand its pathogenesis and thereby to find effective therapies. The therapy of RA is mainly based on methotrexate (MTX) and biological agents that directly target molecules involved in the pathogenesis of RA\u2014e.g., the human soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor etanercept (Enbrel). However, cytokines targeted with such biological agents also play a general role in the immune defence, and the risk of infections increases with use of these agents [1]. Therefore, a continued search for successful therapies for RA is extremely important.",

            "text": "Disease-causing mechanisms underlying RA that can be targeted with a preventive or therapeutic treatment have been difficult to identify [2]. In addition, the search for genes predisposing for autoimmunity has so far had limited success [3\u20136]. Recently, neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (Ncf1) was identified by positional cloning as a gene controlling arthritis severity in rats [7]. Ncf1 (alias p47phox) is an important subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex responsible for the one-electron reduction of oxygen that ultimately yields reactive oxygen species (ROS) [8,9]. This oxidative burst process is used by phagocytes primarily to kill invading pathogens [10]. The surprising finding with the Ncf1 polymorphism in the susceptible Dark Agouti (DA) rat was that increased susceptibility to arthritis was associated with low oxidative burst capacity [7], contradicting the hypothesis in current use that high levels of free radicals promotes inflammation [11]. This finding led us to propose that substances that increase the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex could ameliorate and possibly prevent severe arthritis. In this study we used rats as an experimental model of RA to identify compounds that increase oxidative burst capacity in vivo and investigate whether these substances thereby could have a therapeutic effect on arthritis.",

We had already seen that certain oils with an alkane structure, such as phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol) and pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane), had an oxidative burst-inducing capacity in vitro. Additionally, despite structural similarity, pristane induced arthritis, whereas phytol protected against it [7]. To examine the structure/function relationship we screened a number of short saturated alkanes (C8\u2013C17) using an isoluminol-based oxidative burst assay [14] on human promyelocytes (HL-60) differentiated to granulocytes in the presence of DMSO. Alkanes 11\u201313 carbons long were the most potent in activating the NADPH oxidase complex (Figure 1A). To investigate their arthritogenic potential, we injected the alkanes into arthritis-susceptible DA rats carrying the DA Ncf1 allele (Ncf1\nDA). Alkanes with 15 carbons or more, such as pristane, induced arthritis, whereas shorter alkanes did not (Figure 1B). We therefore concluded that the arthritis-inducing effect of these oils is independent of their oxidative burst-inducing capacity.",

Also after PMA stimulation, phytol-primed granulocytes had a higher response capacity (Figure 3A), whereas T cells showed only a barely detectable increase in ROS production (Figure 3B). Compared to the level of oxidative burst in granulocytes, T cells are minor producers of ROS (Figure 3C). T cells were also stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3, but this did not further increase the ROS production (Figure S1). The increase in T cell oxidative burst could be a reflection of contaminating ROS from granulocytes. B/T cell ratio was altered after phytol injection (Figure 3D), presumably through an increase of B cell number, because a tendency towards higher levels of IgG and IgM was also seen (Figure 3E). The same tendency was seen after phytol treatment in PIA (unpublished data). Alternatively, the increased B/T ratio could have resulted from decreased T cell numbers. Phytol did not significantly alter T cell distribution, as no effect on the ratio of CD4/CD8 was seen (unpublished data). To investigate whether the change in cell distribution was due to phytol toxicity we analyzed the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic T cells ex vivo 5 d after injection. Levels of dead T cells did not increase (Figure 3F), suggesting that the increased B/T ratio or the disease-preventing effect is not mediated via increased depletion of T cells.",

A significant decrease in arthritis severity comparable to the effect on PIA was observed after preventive administration of phytol also in CIA (Figure 4A). Importantly, phytol suppressed the autoimmune response, as plasma levels of CII specific antibodies on day 27 after immunization were reduced (Figure 4B). Levels of anti-CII of all isotypes were decreased after phytol treatment; also IgM response was lower (Figure 4B), suggesting no shift in T cell response. However, total IgG and IgM levels were not affected (Figure 4C), arguing for a specific effect of phytol on CII-reactive cells. As IgG anti-CII response is T cell-dependent, these data indicate a lower activity of CII autoreactive T helper cells.",

Phytol injection markedly decreased arthritis severity (Figure 5A). A decrease in circulating COMP\u2014a measurement of ongoing cartilage destruction [19]\u2014occurred after treatment (Figure 5B). To determine the therapeutic efficiency in the chronic phase of PIA, phytol was injected two times with 3 d between injections starting when the disease has passed the first phase and relapses were observed (around day 70). The chronic phase is quite different from the acute phase and is controlled by a different set of genes [25]. Importantly, a significant decrease in arthritis severity in treated rats was observed (Figure 5C). Our results clearly show that phytol not only has preventive effects but is therapeutic all along the disease course. Histopathologic analysis of paws from rats treated either before or during the acute phase of PIA revealed an effect on both inflammation and joint destruction (Figure 5D). In sections taken from rats treated in the acute phase of disease a mild inflammation could be seen together with remnants of earlier, more severe inflammation. Rats treated before onset showed no signs of inflammation.",

When donor splenocytes were analyzed for oxidative burst on day 10, rats given phytol up to 3 d before sacrifice had a higher level of intrinsic oxidative burst (without PMA stimulation in vitro) (Figure 7D). No difference in oxidative burst was seen after PMA stimulation, possibly due to the proximity to arthritis onset (unpublished data). Interestingly, none of the rats receiving cells from phytol-treated donors developed arthritis, even if the phytol treatment was given as late as 3 h before sacrifice (Figure 7E). Together with the observation that no increase in oxidative burst capacity occurred in spleen cells from these rats, this argues that ROS-producing cells affect the arthritogenic T cells in vitro, or that the NADPH oxidase activation is transferred to the recipient. However, when oxidative burst was measured in recipients 2 d after transfer, no differences were seen (unpublished data) and when the recipient rats were reimmunized with pristane, all groups developed arthritis (unpublished data) excluding transfer of regulatory T cells.",

Apoptosis did not increase after phytol, in agreement with data from 5 d after treatment.

This new therapeutic approach is based on reversing a phenotype caused by a genetic polymorphism responsible for increased severity of arthritis in both rats and mice [7,32], increasing the possibility that it also operates similarly in humans. The ROS-inducing compound phytol showed comparable or better therapeutic effects in comparison with two of the major drugs used for RA today, i.e., etanercept and MTX, further confirming its possible therapeutic efficacy. Phytol successfully ameliorated arthritis not only in rats with low ROS production but also in rats with normal oxidative burst response, in rats with a different genetic background, and in different models such as PIA, CIA, NOCIA, and adoptive transfer models. Taken together these data suggest that several subtypes of the heterogeneous disease RA could be treated using this approach.",

Patients with chronic granulomatous disease suffer not only from a granulomatous inflammatory disease but also from increased susceptibility to infections. The observed increased arthritis severity in low burst-responding rats could be influenced by increased infection susceptibility. We believe that this is not the case, as we did not observe any pathogenic infections in the rats. Also preliminary data suggest that mice with an Ncf1 mutation showed similar arthritis susceptibility in both conventional and SPF conditions (unpublished data).

            "text": "Recently ROS has been thought not only to act on invading pathogens but also to play an important regulatory role in the immune system. Although granulocytes are the main ROS-producing cell type, a preventive effect on arthritogenic T cells could clearly be seen after treatment. This preventive effect could be mediated at several different stages. It has been shown that coincubation of T cells with ROS-producing granulocytes inhibits cytokine production [34]. Also, T cell expansion [35] and apoptosis [36] are affected by altered levels of oxygen radicals. The increased ROS production seen after phytol treatment could in addition change the general oxidation status of T cells and thereby mediate suppression. Oxidation of proteins on cell surfaces has been shown to be crucial for function, e.g., the protein LAT (linker for activation of T cells) is highly sensitive to redox alterations, resulting in lower T cell receptor signalling after oxidation [37]. A reducing environment has also been shown to be important for T cell proliferation [38]. T cells have themselves been proposed to express the components of the NADPH oxidase complex and to produce ROS [39]. We measured an increased oxidative burst in T cells after phytol treatment, but to a dramatically lower level than that of granulocytes. This increased ROS could be a result of ROS leaking from surrounding granulocytes or produced by other oxidative burst mechanisms independent of Ncf1. We could not exclude, however, the possibility that the T cell oxidative burst has an effect on autoimmunity by itself. T cells are likely to be regulated by ROS produced extracellularly from other cells, such as the Ncf1-dependent activities of antigen-presenting cells and granulocytes, as well as by internal mitochondrial activities. For example, protein tyrosine phosphatases, regulators of a wide array of cellular signalling pathways, can be inactivated by oxidation [40], which is interesting because a polymorphism in PTPN22 has been shown to be associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases, including RA [41]. This mutation leads to a more potent negative effect on T cell receptor signalling akin to what can be envisioned by a reduced cysteine in the combining site of the protein tyrosine phosphatases.",

Ultimately, phytol affected development of arthritogenic T cells very rapidly. As early as 3 h after phytol injection it was no longer possible to transfer disease from pristane-injected rats. The arthritis-preventive effect in adoptive transfer probably operates through down-regulation of arthritogenic T cells and is not mediated by ROS-producing cells in vitro or in the recipient, since the mix of treated and untreated cells transferred arthritis, and no alterations of oxidative burst occurred in the recipient after transfer. The early preventive effect seen after phytol is likely not mediated via induction of oxidative burst in T cells, since the effect is lost in phytol-primed T cells cultured together with arthritogenic T cells.

(B) Phytol ameliorates arthritis also when injected in recipient DA.Ncf1\nDA rats after disease onset.

(C) Phytol inhibits arthritogenic T cells when injected in the donor DA.Ncf1\nDA rat. Spleen cells from phytol treated (500 \u03bcl SC day \u22125) rats were taken day 10 after pristane injection, transferred into na\u00efve DA.Ncf1\nDA rats and the effect of phytol on the development of arthritogenic T cells were followed (n = 8). (D, E) Phytol has a rapid inhibitory effect on arthritogenic T cells. The time-point for the effect of phytol was titrated by administration of phytol (500 \u03bcl SC) on different days after pristane injection (day 0). Day 10 after pristane, donor spleens (DA.Ncf1\nDA) were taken and analyzed for oxidative burst of granulocytes (n = 3) (D) and the cells transferred into na\u00efve DA.Ncf1\nDA recipient rats. The rats were then monitored for arthritis symptoms (E). Cells from rats treated day 0 and control rats were also mixed (50:50) to investigate a possible dominating effect of phytol treatment (control [Cnt], n = 6; phytol, n = 5; and mix, n = 3).
