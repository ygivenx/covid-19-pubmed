To this end, immature mo-DCs were cultured in the presence or absence of Pam3CSK4 or LPS and FhTE, and the production of different cytokines were evaluated in the culture medium. Although FhTE alone did not induce the expression of cytokines by mo-DCs, when cultured together with a maturation stimulus, it enhanced the production of IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs (Fig. 1A and B). Interestingly, this enhanced production of IL-10 was abrogated when FhTE glycans were oxidized with meta-periodate (FhmPox), a common method used to evaluate the biological activity of glycans (Fig. 1C)32. These results indicate that F. hepatica glycoconjugates mediate the enhanced production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs.",

Furthermore, FhTE-uptake to mo-DCs was inhibited with MR- and DC-SIGN-specific antibodies, while it was not modified when using anti-DCIR and anti-MGL antibodies (Fig. 2B). Finally, we evaluated the capacity of MR and DC-SIGN to recognize coated-FhTE using MR- and DC-SIGN-Fc constructions, confirming their participation in the recognition of glycans present in FhTE, which was inhibited with the chelating agent EGTA (Fig. 2C).",

Interestingly, after 15 minutes of incubation, co-localization of FhTE with both DC-SIGN and EEA1 was observed (shown by white arrows in Fig. 4A), but not with LAMP-1.

The interaction between DC-SIGN-Fc and coated-FhTE was inhibited with incubation with EGTA, mannan and the DC-SIGN-specific blocking antibody, while no inhibition was detected with GalNAc or the isotype antibody control (Fig. 4D). Considering that DC-SIGN can recognize both mannosylated and fucosylated glycans, we further evaluated its binding to FhTE when treated with mannosidase, fucosidase, or both enzymes. Treatment of FhTE with any of these glycosidases inhibited DC-SIGN binding (40% inhibition), while treatment of FhTE with both fucosidase and mannosidase resulted in a 70% inhibition rate (Fig. 4D), indicating that DC-SIGN interacts with both fucosylated and mannosylated parasite glycans. GalNAc-ase treatment of FhTE was used as control, revealing no changes in DC-SIGN binding to FhTE as expected due to the lack of MGL binding observed in Fig. 2D.",

To determine the mannosylated and fucosylated N-glycan moietes present in FhTE that may act as DC-SIGN ligands, we characterized and quantified the parasite N-glycans by glycan nanoprofiling3637. Our analyses showed that the N-glycans present in FhTE contained mainly high mannose structures, with only few hybrid and complex glycans with terminal GlcNAc (Supplementary Fig. S1). These mannosylated structures constitute potential ligands for DC-SIGN. Alpha-1,6-fucosylated paucimannose glycans were also detected. However, since fucosylation was only identified in the common core structure unit (Supplementary Fig. S1), these structures would not represent potential ligands of DC-SIGN because it recognizes glycans that are terminally fucosylated such as LDNF, Lex and pseudo-Ley 3538.",

Interestingly, the induction of anergic or regulatory T cells by FhTE-stimulated mo-DCs was mediated by DC-SIGN, since the incubation with the DC-SIGN-specific blocking antibody restored the T cell proliferation (Fig. 6D).

            "text": "This study provides evidence that F. hepatica glycans modulate human DCs through DC-SIGN, favoring the induction of Tregs or cell anergy. In particular, we show that oligomannose glycans present on FhTE preparation enhance the TLR-induced production of IL-10 and IL-27p28. Although F. hepatica glycoconjugates were both recognized and internalized by MR and DC-SIGN on DCs, the observed immunomodulation of TLR-matured DCs was mediated only by DC-SIGN and not by MR, DCIR or MGL, suggesting a main role of this receptor in the DC-immunoregulatory properties induced by this helminth. DC-SIGN interacts with a wide range of pathogens of major impact on public health, including viruses456, bacteria830 and parasites11121314 via both fucose (for instance in Lewis and sulfo-Lewis structures) and high-mannose glycans in a Ca-dependent manner39. However, until now, DC-SIGN interaction with helminths was reported only via fucosylated glycans and not high-mannose structures1440. Oligomannose and paucimannose N-glycans present in FhTE could constitute ligands for DC-SIGN through mannose. Our results demonstrate the capacity of DC-SIGN to recognize mannosylated glycoconjugates on F. hepatica components, since the binding of DC-SIGN to FhTE was partially abolished after mannosidase treatment. In addition, we also confirm that DCs interact with helminth fucosylated-glycans via DC-SIGN. Considering that we did not identify potential fucosylated N-glycans that could serve as ligands for DC-SIGN, and together with the fact that defucosylation of FhTE reduces DC-SIGN recognition for parasite components, we propose that DC-SIGN fucosylated ligands are present in O-glycans or glycolipids. Of note, since FhTE is a total parasite lysate, it contains both external and internal glycoconjugates. Thus, to establish the role of DC-SIGN during F. hepatica infection, in vivo studies are necessary.",

            "text": "F. hepatica evades host immunity by different mechanisms, including immunomodulation of DC maturation and function273032, resulting in. altered Th2 polarization and inducing tolerogenic/regulatory properties28. We have previously reported the expression of IL-10 by semi-matured DCs from F. hepatica infected animals32, indicating that the parasite is able to immune-regulate DCs during infection. We now demonstrate that F. hepatica glycans can immunomodulate TLR-induced maturation of human DCs in a DC-SIGN-dependent process. Thus, DC-SIGN interacts with F. hepatica glycans and mediates the increased production of IL-10 and IL-27p28 by TLR-matured DCs. IL-10 is a key immune-regulatory cytokine that can impair the proliferation, cytokine production and migratory capacities of effector T cells41 or induce T cell anergy42. On the other hand, IL-27 can both exert immuno-stimulatory or suppressive effects. Interestingly, IL-27 can induce IL-10 production and induce the differentiation of the IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells43. In agreement with our results, fucose-induced triggering of DC-SIGN resulted in the induction of IL-27p28 expression and secretion by DCs, driving subsequent follicullar T helper polarization7. Furthermore, this type of phenotype on DCs is induced by other helminths, such as S. mansoni1444, suggesting that fucosylated glycans present on FhTE would trigger DC-SIGN-signaling. In addition, our results indicate that DC-SIGN recognizes next to fucosylated glycans also mannosylated glycans, which can both be present in parasites, that may have a different functional consequence increasing IL-10 and T regs. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether both glycan moieties in F. hepatica glycans trigger different DC-SIGN signaling pathways.",

            "text": "CLR-triggering has been correlated with regulatory T cell differentiation in different pathological contexts44. In particular, DC-SIGN can favor Th1/Th17, Th2, follicular T helper or regulatory T cell polarization44. To further understand whether F. hepatica-triggering of DC-SIGN on DCs can alter T cell activation, we evaluated whether TLR-matured DC conditioned with parasite components were able to limit T cell proliferation. Our results indicate that human DC-SIGN promotes a tolerogenic/regulatory state on DCs since F. hepatica-conditioned DCs induced regulatory mo-DCs via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation by the induction of induction of T-cell tolerance. On the other hand, the interaction of myelin oligodendrocyte glycprotein (MOG) with DC-SIGN in the context of simultaneous TLR4 activation resulted in enhanced IL-10 secretion and decreased T cell proliferation21. Furthermore, H. pylori glycans that interact with DC-SIGN induced tolerogenic DCs that failed to induce T cell effector functions but induced regulatory T cells45. In the context of F. hepatica immunoregulatory properties, other CLRs can also participate in the induction of T cell anergy as has been recently proposed for the MR on bone marrow-derived DCs induced anergic-like T cells via DCs, although only a small reduction of T cell anergy was found when using DCs from knock-out mice, suggesting that other CLRs can participate in this process33. Furthermore, this process did not seem to be mediated by recognition of parasite glycoconjugates by the MR on BMDCs but the MR interacting with CD4+ T cells33. Thus, our work provides an additional mechanism of induction of T cell anergy induced by F. hepatica-conditioned DCs.",

The purification of glycan structures was performed using PGC SPE columns of porous activated charcoal and the remaining detergent was removed by incubation with detergent out beads. Purified N-glycans were derivatized with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) via reductive amination in the reducing end.

Glycan species were quantified based on fluorescence and structures were identified base on the information obtained from the MS/MS fragmentation pattern. Subsequently WAX bound charged species were eluted with 500 mM ammonium formate and trapped onto the C18 trap column and analyzed as mentioned above.",
