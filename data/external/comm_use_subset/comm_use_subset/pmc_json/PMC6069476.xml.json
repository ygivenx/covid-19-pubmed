            "text": "Marine oil spill disasters are one of the major concerns in the ocean environment [1]. Oil spills can be caused by people making mistakes, equipment breaking down, natural disasters, etc. The 2010 Gulf oil spill and the 2011 Bohai bay oil spill are well-known large marine oil spill events [2,3,4,5]. Oil rapidly spreads out on the water\u2019s surface, and it forms a thin oil slick. As the oil continues spreading, the oil slick gets thinner, and consequently the slick becomes a very thin sheen. The oil spills can be very harmful to birds, turtles, fishes and shellfish. Thus, it has a negative effect on both economy and ecosystem. The economic damage is caused by the destruction of the ecosystem, and then the oil spill pollution causes, not only immediate damage, but also persistent problems [6]. In order to minimize the damage, it is most important to monitor the oil spill and establish proper measures according to the monitoring results.",

            "text": "It is well-known that oil-covered pixels appear dark in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images because oil spills on the ocean surface dampen Bragg scattering [7,8,9]. Based on the characteristics, various studies have focused on the detection of oil spills. The most commonly used method for oil spill detection is to divide the image into two parts by applying the threshold value which is determined in a bimodal histogram created by oil-free surface and oil-covered surface. Since it is simple and accurate, many studies have proposed an oil spill detection algorithm based on the simple or adaptive thresholding techniques [10,11,12,13]. Further improved oil spill detection algorithms, which are based on the intensity difference between the target and background pixels, have been proposed by exploiting (i) the texture information of sea surface cover types [14,15,16,17]; (ii) the statistical value of oil spills [17,18,19] or (iii) the edge detection between oil spill and the oil-free surface [20,21,22,23]. However, the methods suffer from a false detection problem due to look-alikes that produce a similar signal with oil spill; for example, low-wind zones (wind speed < 3 m/s), internal wave, ship wake and biogenic films [24,25]. To overcome this issue, morphological features of oil spills (i.e., perimeter, area, and complexity) or wind data have been used for oil spill detection [13,26]. However, it can be difficult (i) to define standard shapes for oil spills owing to the high fluidity or (ii) to distinguish the shape of oil spills from that of look-alikes (e.g., ship wake and biogenic films).",

In most studies, an artificial neural network (ANN) of object-based algorithm is usually applied to detect oil spills, the first reason is to use the morphological features as input neurons. The second is that the machine learning method is highly dependent on the input layer, especially, there is a problem that false detection and non-detection due to the noise of the input data is greatly increased when using the pixel-based ANN algorithm. Thus, most studies have adopted an object-based algorithm. However, the object-based algorithm has problems that the dark spot detection accuracy is considerably low, and it is furthermore difficult to automate the algorithm. Moreover, in the case of massive outflow accidents (e.g., the sinking of an oil tanker), it is almost impossible to apply the algorithm because oil forms one big object and normal morphological characteristics can be significantly altered.",

Four polarized images (HH, HV, VV, and VH) can be obtained from SAR sensors according to the transmitting and receiving modes of the radar signal. Among them, co-polarization (HH or VV) occurs when transmit and receive polarizations are identical. The phase difference between VV- and HH-polarized images can be represented by the co-polarized phase difference (CPD), and CPD has a higher correlation with oil spill than it does with look-alikes, which have a weak-damping effect [32]. In addition, the coherence between VV- and HH-polarized images are very low in oil spill areas, whereas it is very high in oil-free areas, which is close to 1. The coherence denotes the degree of correlation between two complex signals. For more optimal solution of oil spill detection using the co-polarized information, we need to focus on the creation process of optimal input neurons for the ANN algorithm from co-polarized SAR imagery, because the creation of optimal input neurons is very important in the ANN technique [33].",

For this, we focus on (i) the oil spill enhancement from the intensity and phase information of the co-polarized TerraSAR-X imagery and (ii) the precise identification of oil-covered surface from the oil spill-enhanced images via the ANN approach. Four maps were extracted from the HH and VV single-look complex (SLC) images, which include the intensity, texture, coherence and phase texture maps, and then oil-covered areas in the maps were emphasized through multi-looking and the non-local (NL) means and median filtering. The ANN approach is used to generate an oil spill probability map from the four emphasized maps, and then oil-covered areas are identified from the probability map. The oil spill detection performance is validated by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In addition, we compare between the results from the presence and absence of the phase information, because most SAR images are acquired from the single-polarization. The proposed method has the advantage that it can estimate the oil spill probability at the pixel unit, and hence it would be effectively used for large-scale oil spill accidents. Moreover, the proposed method enables us (i) to reduce false detection associated with look-alike as well as (ii) to improve the detection performance of oil spill areas.",

Table 1 summarizes the imaging characteristics of the test image used for this study. As seen in Figure 1a, it is very clear that oil-covered surface is very dark in the TerraSAR-X image even when compared with sea surface. The characteristics of the SAR image enable us to detect oil spill areas easily. Nevertheless, false detection problems due to speckle noise and look-alikes are present, as aforementioned. The 30-m shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) was used to mask land area in order to remove false alarms from the land area.",

The oil impacted on both the Taman and Crimean peninsulas depending on wind and ocean currents [35].

The ocean currents in the Kerch Strait during the period of 11\u201316 November were exclusively directed from the Black to the Azov Sea with branches from the Kerch Strait to the Taman Bay [34]. More details of the wind condition and ocean currents can be found in [34,35]. The location of sunk of Volganefti-139 is shown in Figure 1a.

The speckle noise can make a pixel value extremely high or low compared with surrounding pixels, and hence it causes un-detection or false detection.

An adoptive filter can be applied to reduce the speckle noise, but most filters have a trade-off relationship between the spatial resolution and noise removal. Recently the NL-means filter was designed to reduce image noise while minimizing resolution loss. More details can be found in [36]. The NL-mean filtered intensity map is generated by three steps as follows:(i)sigma-naught image is generated from the SLC VV image,(ii)multi-looked image is created from the sigma-naught image, and(iii)NL-means filtered intensity map is created from the multi-looked image.",

Further noise reduction is performed by the NL-means filter. Since the HH polarization has a high dependency on incidence angle, so as the angle increases, the intensity value of the sea decreases accordingly. This phenomenon makes the distinction between sea and oil spill more difficult in HH images [37]. For this reason, the VV-polarized image is used for generating the intensity map.",

This map has a high correlation with the oil spill and a low value in the look-alike region having the weak-damping effect. In look-alike region, this map contained no bright pixels. Therefore, if using the phase texture image which have been removed ship, it is possible that oil spill is accurately detected without false detection caused by look-alike and ship.

Both results seem to have properly detected the oil spill area. The Figure 9c,d shows the histogram of each probability to compare the distribution of the values. In Process 1, a peak is observed around a probability of 0.1, which is formed by pixels corresponding to the oil-free surface. The frequency of other probabilities except the probability due to the oil-free surface is not much different. In other words, it is difficult to determine the threshold value for distinguishing between oil spill and oil-free because the peak due to oil spill is not observed clearly. On the other hand, in Figure 8d, peaks are observed at a probability of about 0.1 and one peak is additionally observed at around 0.9, which is a pixel representing oil spilled on the ocean. It can be seen that it is easier to determine the threshold between the two covers in probability because the two distributions have distinct peaks. That is, when all four input neurons are used, it means that the oil spill area can be detected more accurately.

For the probability map calculated using all layers, the highest probability value of a look-alike was less than ~0.36 (Figure 5c). This reflects the ability of the phase texture map to distinguish biogenic film and oil spills.

In oil region, mean value decreased by 0.04 and standard deviation of 0.03. This difference is due to the coherence and phase texture maps. Both images showed a distinct contrast value between oil spill and oil-free ocean surface pixels. Coherence values were closer to 1 in ocean areas, but considerably smaller in the oil region. In contrast, for the phase texture map high pixel values were seen in the oil spill area, whereas low values were seen for ocean surface areas.

In this study, specificity relates to non-oil spill pixels judged to be oil-free pixels, whereas sensitivity relates to oil spill pixels classified as oil-covered pixels. The area under the curve (AUC) is the calculated value of the bottom area of the ROC curve. AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, and those closer to 1 (100%) represent more meaningful models. Values less than 0.5 are considered to be worthless [40]. According to [41], AUC is divided into five levels: excellent (0.9\u20131.0), good (0.8\u20130.9), fair (0.7\u20130.8), poor (0.6\u20130.7), and fail (0.5\u20130.6).

Verification of the two results showed 95.03% and 95.19% high accuracy, respectively, as shown in Figure 12. This reflects the fact that both results detected almost all of the oil spill areas and the numbers of biogenic film pixels were relatively low in comparison. The results confirm that using the proposed algorithm, the ocean surface is less likely to be classified as oil and the removal effect of biogenic film is improved. However, the results would not be enough to present the robustness of the proposed method. To overcome this limitation, further validation process should be performed by using several oil spill accidents including different wind situations and look-alikes.",

To solve this problem, research has been carried out to consider morphological features using object-based ANN.

In this study, an oil spill probability map was constructed by applying ANN with input neurons, including an NL-means filtered intensity map, a normalized texture map of intensity, and a coherence and phase texture map. The proposed algorithm shows improved results and its accuracy of about 95.19% is validated by using an ROC curve. The results of comparing the two probability maps according to the presence or absence of phase information, it can be seen that the probability of oil spill detection is increased when the phase information is used. Although it is slight, the probability of the oil-free surface being classified as an oil spill is entirely reduced. That is, the phase information enhances the accuracy of the classification by strengthening the contrast between the pixel in which the oil exists and the pixel that does not exist. It is also confirmed that by using the phase information together, it reduces the probability of about 0.3 in the look-alike with weak damping effect.",
