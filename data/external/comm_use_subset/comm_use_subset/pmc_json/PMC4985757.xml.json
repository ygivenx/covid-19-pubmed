On the mobile phone of each volunteer, a PEARL client was installed to scan nearby PEARL clients via Bluetooth technique every 5 minutes. The detected Bluetooth addresses and scan time were recorded. Thus, in every 5 minutes, the CPI data was obtained among the individuals, from which a basic network was reconstructed with every node representing an individual, and every edge representing a 5-minute CPI among two individuals. The summation of all 288 (24 \u00d7 60/5 = 288) basic networks in a certain day formed a daily aggregation of CPI networks, where edge weights denote the aggregate CPI duration in the entire day.

For fair comparison, un-weighted version of real CPI networks should be employed. A straightforward strategy to achieve this objective is to simply ignore the duration of real CPIs, no matter how strong or weak they are. However, this strategy might lead to deviation in calculation of network statistics, as CPIs greatly vary in durations (Figs 1 and S2). In fact, the CPI durations can be perfectly fitted by the mixture of a Poisson distribution and a truncated Gaussian distribution (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S3). These two distributions were used to describe transient CPIs formed by purely random interactions, and regular CPIs representing meaningful interactions among students, respectively. Based on the intersection point of these two distributions, a threshold to separate transient and regular CPIs can be reasonably determined as 30 minutes, i.e., CPIs with duration no more than 30 minutes were treated as transient. Here, only regular CPIs were considered in calculations of network statistics, and idealized networks were generated with same size to the real CPI networks with transient CPIs removed.",

            "text": "The analysis of network statistics are described as below.Degree distribution: In a CPI network, the degree of an individual refers to the number of partners that have interactions with this individual. It is well known that a uniformly random network approximates a Poisson degree distribution, and that a scale-free network is featured by its power-law degree distribution; thus, degree distribution is commonly used as a criterion to judge whether a network is scale-free or uniformly random20.As shown in Fig. 2, the SCAU1031 network has a degree distribution that is significantly different from both the Poisson distribution and power-law distribution. Thus, the CPI networks acquired on weekdays are neither uniformly random nor scale-free. However, SCAU1105, a CPI network acquired on a weekend, exhibits a typical power-law degree distribution. This observation is consistent with the viewpoint that on weekends, CPI networks are mainly determined by friendship among students10, and friendship networks usually exhibit a power-law degree distribution21. Similar observations were made from other real CPI networks in SCAU (shown in Supplementary Fig. S4).CC and efficiency: These two features are commonly used to quantify the small-world behavior of networks. Specifically, CC describes the extent to which nodes in a network tend to cluster, and efficiency measures the speed at which bacteria or viruses spread across a human contact network. In general, a small-world network has a high CC but low efficiency; thus, CC and efficiency are commonly used as criteria to judge whether a network is small-world or not20.\nAs shown in Fig. 3A, our SCAU networks on weekdays from October 31 to November 4, 2011 have a CC of ~0.70 while the CC of the counterpart small-world networks has a maximum of 0.55. Furthermore, the CC of SCAU networks on the weekends (November 5 and 6, 2011) are at least 0.60, which are substantially higher than that of the counterpart small-world networks (less than 0.1). However, the efficiency of SCAU networks were found to be lower than that of the corresponding small-world networks, especially those on weekends. Together, these statistics demonstrated that SCAU networks are not small-world networks.\nOur SCAU networks also exhibited higher CC than that in the US and French schools. The SCAU CPI networks displayed a lower efficiency than that studied in the US schools, but higher than that observed in the French school. Interestingly, the USTB networks exhibited a similar pattern to that of SCAU networks except for the larger deviations of CC as well as efficiency.Modularity: As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, the network SCAU1031 consists of a set of tightly interacting modules. This observation was confirmed by quantitative analysis of modularity, which measures the degree that a network can be separated into disconnected communities. There, the SCAU networks possess an average modularity of ~0.82, which is considerably higher than that of the counterpart small-world (0.62), scale-free (0.23), and uniformly-random networks (0.25). Supplementary Fig. S5 also reveals the complicated dynamics of communities, including community merging and diversification. Therefore, it is not sufficient to understand CPI patterns merely based on the CPI network acquired on a single day.\nIn addition to the comparison with idealized networks, SCAU networks were also compared with real CPI networks acquired in the US and French schools. As shown in Table 1, the SCAU CPI networks exhibit an average modularity (0.78) that is significantly higher than USD (0.49) and USHS (0.43) networks.Periodicity: A strong periodicity of CPI networks was expected according to the weekly school schedule of college students. However, similarity analysis of the daily CPI networks from October 31 to November 27, 2011 shows that this periodicity is weak (Supplementary Fig. S6), highlighting the necessity of investigating long-term real CPI data.",

First, the CPI networks in the two representative Chinese colleges are different from the CPI networks acquired from the US as well as French schools. One explanation is that Chinese college students commonly have highly organized lifestyle, such as living in neighboring dormitories on the same campus, having meals in large-capacity canteens altogether, and being organized into classes for taking identical courses. This highly organized lifestyle is reflected in the formation of a set of small but tightly-interacting communities. Second, the SCAU CPI networks acquired on weekdays are neither scale-free, small-world, nor uniformly random. This challenges the basic assumption of idealized CPI networks adopted in traditional approaches to epidemic research5678. Such assumption might result in a large deviation in disease dynamics, which has been confirmed by the difference in epidemic dynamics across real CPI networks with that across idealized CPI networks (shown below).",

Surprisingly, idealized CPI networks substantially differ from the real SCAU CPI networks in simulating spreading of influenza as well as infectious diseases that transmit relatively slowly (Fig. 5). Specifically, in the simulation of influenza spreading using idealized small-world networks, almost all individuals were found to be infected, and the basic reproductive number R0 was estimated to be as high as 9.5. In contrast, the percentage of individuals infected is only 55%, and R0 is only 3.8 when real SCAU CPI networks were used for simulation (Fig. 5A,B). Furthermore, the epidemic dynamics of infectious diseases that transmit relatively slowly was simulated by setting relatively small parameter \u03b20 \u2264 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 sec\u22121. As shown in Fig. 5A, all individuals are infected in the simulations using idealized CPI networks; however, the percentage of infected individuals is less than 35% in the simulations using real SCAU CPI networks. In addition, the disease spreading across real SCAU CPI networks shows early peak epidemic time but short epidemic duration (Fig. 5C,D).

First, in both the simulations of influenza and the simulations of the diseases that transmit relatively slowly, the percentages of total individuals infected in SCAU and FRPS are less than half of those of the US schools. Second, the simulations across SCAU and FRPS networks show a R0 of less than 3, which is substantially smaller than that in USD and USHS CPI networks (USD: 6.5, USHS: 9.4). This small R0 implies a relatively slow transmission in SCAU and FRPS. Third, for the diseases that transmit relatively slowly, a delayed peak epidemic time is observed in US schools compared to those in SCAU and FRPS. Similar observations were also obtained when the SCAU networks are replaced with the USTB networks, implying that these observations are general to Chinese colleges (Supplementary Fig. S8).",

Due to the lack of long-term CPI data, previous studies were required to construct a sequence of CPI networks whereby a CPI network acquired on a particular day was simply repeated. In contrast, we gathered 28-day real CPI data in two representative Chinese colleges, allowing an examination of the previously-used network construction strategies. Our experimental results reveal that the previously-used strategy of network construction results in a substantial deviation from the 28-day CPI real networks in epidemic simulation (Supplementary Fig. S9). One underlying reason for this observation is related to the fact that by simply repeating a single day\u2019s CPI network, the community dynamics, such as merging, vanishing or expansion of network communities during the evolving process of long-term CPI networks, cannot be captured (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, a CPI network acquired on any single day may not be representative of the entire CPI network sequence. Our study also reveals that the CPI network data obtained in seven consecutive days yielded simulation results close to that of the entire 28-day CPI networks, indicating the CPI data obtained for seven days can be used for epidemic research of disease spreading in schools (Supplementary Fig. S9).",

In addition, epidemic simulations across the acquired CPI networks are in good agreement with real influenza outbreak records (Fig. 4).
