The virus has a wide host range and causes a transient viremia in many wild, domesticated and laboratory mammals [1, 4, 5]. Humans usually acquire infection by tick bite or through unprotected contact with body fluids of infected animals or humans; additionally, several nosocomial outbreaks have been reported [1, 2]. In contrast to humans, adult immuno-competent mammals have not yet been reported to develop signs of disease [1, 2, 6]. This has impaired animal model development and hampered the testing of medical countermeasures against CCHF. CCHFV is an interferon-sensitive virus and its replication is highly reduced by treatment with interferon in interferon-signaling competent cells [7\u20139]. These observations led to the discovery that adult mice with gene knockouts in interferon signaling pathways, such as the signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1-/-) and the interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR-/-) mouse strains, are highly susceptible to CCHFV infection mimicking some hallmarks of human disease [10\u201312].",

Over the past 20 years, CCHF has emerged or re-emerged in several countries often with dramatically increased case numbers. Furthermore, there has been a marked increase of imported cases of CCHF in European and South Asian countries [13\u201317]. The root causes of the increased CCHF incidence rates are not fully understood, but factors such as shifts in climate patterns, animal and human migratory patterns, population increase in livestock and wildlife accompanied by changes in agricultural practices and increased land use may be responsible [18, 19]. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against this significant emerging zoonosis.",

            "text": "Over the past few years several vaccine candidates have been evaluated for protective efficacy in pre-clinical studies. Among those were vaccines based on DNA, viral subunits, whole inactivated virus, virus-like particle (VLP) and viral vectors such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) [20\u201325]. Full protection against lethal CCHFV challenge in a mouse model was achieved with DNA plasmids expressing GPC subunits and N, as well as a MVA vector expressing the GPC open reading frame. Partial protection was observed with whole inactivated virus preparations, a DNA plasmid expressing GPC, VLPs (consisting of N, GPC and L), and a combined plasmid DNA (GPC subunits and N)/VLP vaccination approach [23\u201325]. No protection was achieved with a soluble glycoprotein subunit vaccine and MVA expressing CCHFV N. Overall, these studies implicate immune responses to the glycoproteins as most important for protection, however the glycoprotein subunit platform has not shown any protection despite inducing a significant antibody response [22]. Due to the high genetic diversity of the surface glycoproteins (69\u201399% amino acid identity between CCHFV strains), a broadly efficacious vaccine may need an additional, more genetically conserved CCHFV antigen such as N (91\u201399% amino acid identity between CCHFV strains) [26, 27].",

The mouse strains include the interferon signaling deficient IFNAR-/- and STAT1-/- mouse strains and the humanized Hu-NSG-SGM3 mice [10\u201312, 29]. The Hu-NSG-SGM3 express certain human cytokines and human leukocytes, however the disease progression is somewhat atypical as the disease is primarily neurological [29]. Both the STAT1-/- and IFNAR-/- mice possess complete sets of murine immune systems, but their cells either have altered response to interferon signaling or do not respond to type I interferon signaling, respectively, leading to rapid disease more reminiscent of human hemorrhagic fever [10\u201312]. IFNAR-/- mice are highly susceptible to severe disease caused by several viral agents [11, 12, 30\u201331] due to lower and/or altered immune responses to infections compared with wild type mice [32\u201335]. The IFNAR-/- mice frequently do not respond as quickly to infection as wild type mice and, furthermore, CCHFV replicates to higher levels than in wild type mice [12]. The increased difficulty in protecting IFNAR-/- mice from infection seems associated with insufficient immune responses due to inadequate cross-priming of antigen presenting cells [32]. Thus, efficacy testing of vaccines in this model can be difficult as protective vaccines must elicit proper immune responses by circumventing IFNAR-/- dampened antigen priming, and must stimulate an effective adaptive immune response that can compensate for the lack of antiviral state activation and reduction of CCHFV replication normally mediated by type I interferon signaling. Therefore, IFNAR-/- mice should be considered a \u201chigher bar\u201d for efficacy testing of vaccines than fully immunocompetent rodent models.",

The MVA, plasmid DNA and VLP vaccine platforms have had success in protecting mice from lethal CCHFV challenge, and the protection afforded was dependent on both humoral and cell-mediated immunity [20, 21, 24, 25, 36]. In addition, all the platforms strongly suggests that immune responses directed against the GPC, whether antibody or T cell driven, are essential for protection in rodents [20\u201325, 36]. While vaccination regimens that focus on a single antigen have been successful, an ideal vaccination candidate would facilitate immune response against multiple antigens and achieve protection with as few doses as possible.",

            "text": "Ad vectors are known to elicit strong humoral and cell mediated immune responses in IFNAR-/- mice [37]. Therefore, an Ad-based platform was utilized here to address whether IFNAR-/- mice can be protected from lethal CCHFV infection using only the more conserved CCHFV N as the antigen. In this study, IFNAR-/- mice vaccinated with Ad-N developed IgG responses to CCHFV N (S1 Fig) and were partially protected from CCHFV challenge (Figs 1\u20133; S2 Fig). Due to a lack of GPC antigen in the vaccine preparations protection is unlikely to be mediated by neutralizing antibodies but rather due to priming of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and/or non-neutralizing antibody responses as has been previously reported for the Ad platform in other IFNAR-/- vaccine studies [38]. Additional experiments are required to demonstrate which of the CD4+, CD8+ T cell and/or antibody responses after vaccination/infection are responsible for protection. Several studies have evaluated correlates of protection in IFNAR-/- mice to CCHFV infection. The role of adaptive immune responses following MVA immunization was evaluated using the transfer of antibodies and/or T-cells to na\u00efve IFNAR-/- mice [36], while vaccine studies employing DNA and VLP vaccination were evaluated using circulating cytokine profiling [24] and/or IgG subtype ratios [24, 25]. These or alternate experiments, such as selective depletion of B- and T-cell populations following vaccination, could also determine the importance of each of the two arms of the adaptive immune system in response to Ad vaccination. However, it is important to caution that despite their utility and appropriateness for early stage vaccine testing, IFNAR-/- mice are severely immuno-compromised, inbred mice and therefore may generate different protective immune responses than immuno-competent outbred populations of humans and/or animals [12].",
