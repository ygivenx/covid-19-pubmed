            "text": "Ureaplasma species are among the most common isolates from the human urogenital tract [1,2]. Although ureaplasmas can be isolated from healthy individuals, epidemiologic studies have shown a strong association between Ureaplasmas and various diseases including non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), bacterial vaginosis, infertility, prostatitis, epididymitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), nephrolithiasis, postpartum endometritis, chorioamnionitis, spontaneous abortion, premature birth, stillbirth and neonatal pneumonia [1-4]. Animal studies have demonstrated the ability of ureaplasmas to induce pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and struvite uroliths (urinary tract stones primarily composed of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate) [5-10]. The most common host immune response to Ureaplasma during disease states involves elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1, accompanied by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages at sites of infection [1,10-12]. However, little work has been done to characterize the immune response during uncomplicated infections. Therefore, the complex interactions between Ureaplasma and the host that lead to simple colonization versus inflammation and disease are largely unknown. In a recent study, we showed that the inbred rat strain Fischer 344 (F344) is susceptible to UTI induced by a rat adapted strain of Ureaplasma parvum isolated from the urine of a patient with recurrent UTI [13]. As part of that study, we found that 60% of infected F344 rats developed struvite uroliths, which were associated with an exaggerated inflammatory response that is similar to what has been reported in other disease states caused by Ureaplasma infection [1,5,6,11,12]. Interestingly, the other 40% of F344 rats developed uncomplicated UTI that was characterized by low concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in urine as well as mild to moderate lesions in the lower urinary tract. Since F344 rats are an inbred strain, this particular infection model would be useful for identifying the host/Ureaplasma interactions that confer disease or asymptomatic infection without confounding variables that would be introduced by genetic variability.",

All animals within the Struvite group had bladder stones, which were composed of 89 to 95% magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite), 1 to 5% calcium phosphate (carbonate apatite) and 3 to 10% protein and blood. No animal had macroscopic evidence of kidney stones at time of necropsy. Although not statistically significant (P \u2264 0.11), animals inoculated with 107 or greater CFU tended to have the highest frequency of struvite uroliths.",

Mast cells could be found within the submucosa regardless of clinical profile (data not shown). Uroepithelial changes ranged from spongiosis of epithelial cells with some necrosis, exfoliation of uroepithelium, or hyperplasia (see Figure 1, panels B, C, and D). Animals with struvite uroliths had the most extensive lesions and the highest lesion scores (Figure 2). In these animals, inflammation extended into the submucosa and muscularis layers, and was occasionally accompanied by venous congestion and edema with a fibrinous reaction (Figure 1, panel B). Neutrophilic infiltrates were present in all of the animals within the Struvite group. In contrast, infiltrates in animals within the Negative and UTI groups were predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages (Figure 2, panel B). Animals with uroliths also had the most extensive uroepithelial hyperplasia as shown in Figure 1, panel C. Animals within the Negative and UTI groups had the mildest inflammatory changes (Figure 2). However, somewhat surprisingly, more animals within the Negative group had a higher degree of both inflammation and epithelial change than did animals within the UTI group.

In addition, the severity of disease for most mycoplasmal infections depends on the host immune response. Therefore, experimental infections in genetically defined animal models will be critical to unraveling the key interactions in the host/parasite relationship that contribute to disease severity. By using a combined approach involving histopathology and cytokine profiling, we were able to further characterize the immune response associated with asymptomatic UTI and UTI complicated with struvite formation.",

In this study, we showed that varying the inoculum dose of U. parvum significantly affected the frequency of animals that remained colonized two weeks after inoculation. Therefore, the initial microbial load is important in establishing infection. However, once infected, the proportion of animals that developed complicated UTI in response to varying inocula of U. parvum did not show a definitive dose response effect. More importantly, the immune response to infection in this group of animals with complicated UTI was consistent, regardless of initial inoculating dose. For example, the cytokine profile and urinary tract pathology of a struvite positive animal that was inoculated with 101 CFU was indistinguishable from a struvite positive animal that was inoculated with 109 CFU. This suggests that the initial microbial load of U. parvum is not a critical factor in the development of complicated UTI in this rat strain.

By profiling the entire cytokine milieu, we were able to identify a significant predominance of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-18, and MCP-1 in the UTI group that work synergistically to regulate monocyte/macrophage activation [16-18]. An intriguing finding was the significant emphasis of IFN-\u03b3 in the urine of animals with asymptomatic UTI, since this cytokine is a potent priming agent for macrophages [19]. This cytokine profile also coincides with the cellular immune response in these animals that consisted of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, which resembles a profile that may be seen during the healing or resolution phase of infection. We cannot rule out that these animals could be displaying a pre-resolution phase to infection, but there are indicators suggesting that these animals have compromised immune defense. For example, the immune profile of these animals was obtained while they were actively colonized with U. parvum, and 65% exhibited an ascending infection into the kidneys. Further, the microbial load of U. parvum in animals with asymptomatic UTI was equivalent to animals in the Struvite group. Another intriguing feature in animals with asymptomatic UTI was the overall lack of uroepithelial proliferation that was present in varying degrees in the Negative group as well as the Struvite group. A primary defense mechanism of uroepithelium exposed to bacteria involves desquamation, necrosis or apoptosis followed by proliferation [20]. Therefore, the overall lack of this response in animals with asymptomatic UTI also implies that uroepithelial defense mechanisms may be perturbed by U. parvum.",

            "text": "F344 rats with struvite uroliths had a similar clinical profile to what we have previously described [13]. Specifically, these animals had the greatest concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines in their urine (GRO/KC \u2013 the rat analog of human IL-8, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and the most extensive inflammatory changes in bladder tissue. Since IL-1\u03b2 is a known inducer of IL-8 and GRO chemokines in human and murine epithelial cells [21-23], it is not an unexpected finding that these cytokines are closely linked in their expression. Cytokine pattern analysis showed this cytokine cluster is unique to animals with struvites. Moreover, there is a significant positive correlation between IL-1\u03b2, GRO/KC and the degree of histopathologic change, which suggests that IL-1\u03b2 and GRO/KC are critical elements in a pro-inflammatory loop that leads to chronic active inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia and struvite formation as seen in struvite positive F344 rats. Most of the animals within the struvite group had uroepithelial hyperplasia or erosion with hemorrhage and inflammation within the kidneys, yet none of these animals had uroliths in the renal pelvis that could account for these lesions. Therefore, although mechanical irritation by the urolith itself may partially contribute to epithelial erosion or hyperplasia in the bladder, it cannot entirely account for the lesions that were present in the urinary tract of these animals.",

            "text": "The immune response of animals within the negative group was highly variable and most likely comprises a mixed population of rats, including animals that never became colonized as well as animals that cleared the infection at various time points post-inoculation. Therefore, interpretation of data from this group of animals is difficult and is done with caution. In spite of this limitation, profiling urine cytokine data and bladder lesion scores by inoculum dose was informative. The threshold dose for successful colonization appears to be between log 5 and log 7 CFU, since 64% and 43% of rats respectively were culture negative 2 weeks post-inoculation. The animals within the log 5 and log 7 CFU inoculation groups also had the greatest flux in both pro-inflammatory (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and GRO/KC) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, and IL-10) cytokines. Interestingly, pattern analysis of urine cytokine data showed two distinct clusters. The first cluster identified in the negative group included IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1; these cytokines were notable as they were not part of the cytokine cluster groupings of U. parvum infected animals. Therefore, these cytokines may be critical in directing a more efficient immune response that leads to bacterial clearance with minimal tissue damage. The second cytokine cluster in the negative group included IFN-\u03b3 and GRO/KC, which are significant cytokines in the UTI and Struvite groups, respectively. Except for animals that were inoculated with log 9 CFU of U. parvum, the expression pattern of IFN-\u03b3 and GRO/KC was not inversely related as they were in culture positive animals. This may be reflecting a more balanced immune response than what is seen in U. parvum positive animals, and we suggest that this balanced response may be critical to resolution of infection and prevention of severe disease.",

            "text": "The variable clinical outcome to experimental inoculation with U. parvum in the F344 rat is an interesting phenomenon since this is an inbred strain. In this study, both genetic and environmental influences on disease were minimized to the extent possible. All of the animals in this study originated from the same colony. Further, rats were housed under the same barrier maintained conditions in order to minimize environmental variability. Despite our efforts, it was common to find that a rat that developed asymptomatic UTI had co-habited the same cage with a rat that developed struvites or was culture negative at time of necropsy. Therefore, external environment could not account for the varying clinical outcome in our study. However, our experimental inoculation procedure may be a critical source of variability. Although attempts were made to reduce mechanical trauma caused by catherization, it is possible that the trauma may have been sufficient to shift the immune response towards a pro-inflammatory profile in a subset of animals. Once this occurred, the pro-inflammatory cycle progressed until infection was resolved (Negative group) or the study was terminated (Struvite group). Another possible explanation for our findings may involve the actual placement of ureaplasmas within the urinary tract at time of inoculation. For example, if the catheter disrupted the uroepithelial barrier so that a sufficient number of ureaplasmas were deposited into the submucosa instead of the mucosal surface, this could elicit a different inflammatory response cascade than what would normally occur if the microorganisms were only present on the mucosal surface of the bladder. The results of this study were similar to what we have previously reported, thus showing the consistency and reproducibility of this model of infection. Moreover, the clinical outcome to ureaplasmal infection in the F344 rat is similar to what occurs in humans. The complex interactions between most mucosal pathogens and the host that lead to uncomplicated colonization versus inflammation and disease are largely unknown. Therefore, this model may be particularly useful for identifying the molecular events that confer asymptomatic infection, complicated infection as well as resolution of infection with an opportunistic pathogen of the urogenital tract.",

We characterized the F344 rat immune response in the urinary tract to varying inoculum concentrations of U. parvum. Establishment of UTI was influenced by microbial load, but the host immune response was independent of microbial load. Two distinct innate immune profiles were identified with two different clinical outcomes: asymptomatic UTI and complicated UTI with struvite formation. Asymptomatic UTI was characterized by a minimal immune response that was predominantly monocytic and lymphocytic and was accompanied by a significantly high rate of kidney infection. UTI complicated with struvite formation was characterized by an exaggerated immune response that was predominantly neutrophilic and was accompanied by uroepithelial hyperplasia and extensive tissue damage.",
