            "text": "Coronaviruses, positive strand non-segmented RNA viruses with the largest RNA genomes known, infect a wide range of hosts, including many mammalian species, and cause a range of diseases, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and neurological diseases [1]. Viruses of zoonotic potential are found within the coronaviruses, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in Southern China in 2003 [2], and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [3]. In both cases the infection of humans is thought to have arisen by contact with an intermediate host which in turn acquired the virus from the original reservoir, presumed to be bats [4,5]. The basis of cross-species infection lies primarily in the ability of the virus major surface spike protein, S, to bind to cell surface receptors and initiate infection. Coronaviruses use a variety of receptors ranging from sugars to extended cell surface proteins (reviewed in [6]) and the entry receptor for MERS infection has been identified as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), found on a variety of cell types including epithelial cells of the respiratory tract [7,8]. More recently, sialic acid has been shown to be an additional low-affinity attachment receptor whose binding might precede that of DPP4, suggesting that its distribution may also contribute to virus tropism [9].",

            "text": "Receptor binding by the S protein occurs via the N-terminal S1 domain [10] while the conformational change that follows is driven by the S2 domain, leading to the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm [11]. Separation of the S1 and S2 domains is mediated by host cell proteases including members of the cathepsin family and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [12]. The S2 protein comprises the fusion peptide, two conserved heptad repeats (HR) (distant in the primary amino acid sequence but adjacent in the post-fusion conformation), a transmembrane domain and a short intracellular tail [11]. The structural features of S, including the fusion peptide, are essential for spike function and have been suggested as targets for therapeutic intervention [13]. Fusion peptides have been generally described as sequences of 15\u201325 apolar amino acids which locate to and order membranes on binding to enable the fusion process to begin [14]. The boundaries of coronavirus fusion peptides have yet to be precisely mapped, but the consensus is that the S fusion peptide lies in the N-terminus of the S2 domain, just downstream of the S1/S2 boundary [15]. For SARS-CoV S, mutagenesis, structural and lipid mixing studies have suggested a motif SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGF which is conserved across the coronavirus family and within which the core sequence IEDLLF demonstrates only infrequent and conservative replacements [16,17]. Most recently, this putative SARS fusion peptide has been shown to induce Ca2+-dependent membrane ordering consistent with its role during virus\u2013host membrane fusion [18].",

To visualize the GUVs, 0.5 mol% of naphtha [2,3-alpha] pyrene (Tokyo Chemical Industry UK Ltd., Oxford, UK) was added. Lipids were mixed in an amber vial to a final total lipid concentration of 9 mM before preparation by electroformation. Briefly, 20 \u00b5L of lipid stock was spread on the conductive side of an indium tin oxide slide (ITO slide). After the evaporation of the solvent, the slide was put into a vacuum desiccator for 1 h to remove any remaining trace of the solvent. A 28 mm O-ring was coated on one side with silicon grease and placed around the dried lipid film to prevent leakage of the rehydration solution. The lipid film was hydrated with 750 \u00b5L of 0.1 mM sucrose solution in deionized water. Then the second ITO slide was placed on top of the O-ring with the conductive sides facing each other. A tension of 3 V peak to peak and a frequency of 5 Hz was applied to the ITO slides over a period of 2 h at 50 \u00b0C [19].

The identified sequence, which is related to the SARS-CoV putative fusion peptide [18] is not located at the N-terminus of HR1 as suggested in some S protein cleavage maps (e.g., [13]), but immediately follows the second (S2\u2032) cleavage site originally mapped in SARS-CoV S and later in MERS-CoV S [22,23]. Given its high degree of conservation and its location at a critical biologically relevant junction, the 15 residue wild type peptide was synthesized for in vitro activity assessment along with five variants in which selected hydrophobic residues previously implicated in the SARS fusion peptide were exchanged for alanine to probe those positions that were essential for activity (Table 1).",

GUVs, composed of 5 mM DPPC, 4 mM egg SM and 0.5 mol% cholesterol, were reconstituted with the peptides at concentrations of 10, 1 and 0.1 \u00b5M. All samples also contained 0.5% naphthopyrene to allow observation by fluorescence microscopy. Their shape was measured as the ratio between the longest and shortest radii while the relative size of the GUVs was estimated by Ramanujan\u2019s first approximation, taking an average of 40 GUVs per experiment for three separate experiments, with vesicles only and the M2-Influenza peptide acting as controls (Figure 2). The WT peptide was shown to change the shape and size of the GUV membrane, leading to extensive deformation at 10 \u00b5M. At the lower peptide concentration of 1 \u00b5M, the absolute size and shape did not vary despite a change in GUV appearance with time. Meanwhile, at 0.1 \u00b5M the putative fusion peptide caused membrane permeability due to pore formation observed as loss of fluorescence, leading to a cuplike shape, as described elsewhere [24]. Control GUVs treated with buffer only showed no deformation, while the M2-Influenza peptide at 10 \u00b5M concentration led to GUVs budding and forming large luminal vesicles, as described in [20], thus validating the assay.",

            "text": "To confirm a role for the putative fusion peptide in a biological system, a syncytium assay based on the expression of complete S protein was established, similar to that described for the avian coronavirus IBV [25]. The S coding region was expressed from the CAG promoter present in vector pTriEx1.1 following the transfection of Lenti-X 293T cells and was detected with a monoclonal antibody specific for S. The presence of the receptor DPP4 was confirmed by staining with a DPP4 monoclonal antibody (Figure 4C). When transfected cells were cultured in the presence of trypsin, to ensure the maturation of the spike protein when endogenous cleavage is inefficient [23], and subject to an acid pulse followed by a period of recovery, profuse syncytia characterized by merged cells (indicated) with diffuse S staining extending into non-transfected adjacent cells and very few individual cells were observed, consistent with S-mediated fusion (Figure 4A). To assess the role of the residues identified in the peptide\u2013GUV binding assays in syncytium formation, each mutation was introduced into the S sequence and the assays repeated with syncytium forming ability screened by acid pulse as before. In all cases, while the expression of MERS-CoV S with mutations at I890A, L893A, L894A and F895A did not alter the expression of the protein as judged by the intensity of S antibody staining, cell-to-cell fusion was not apparent following the post-transfection treatment. Fields typically contained single cells with S staining in the cytosol and at the cell periphery but not extending into non-transfected adjacent cells (Figure 4B). These data are correlated with the membrane deformation activity of peptides that included the same mutations and confirm the I890L893F895 core identified by GUV binding as essential for activity as well as critical for cell fusion.",

In addition, S is a target for therapeutic intervention via peptides that compete with the fusion reaction or the cleavage between S1 and S2 [13]. Here, alignments of the spike protein of MERS with several other coronavirus spike proteins revealed a conserved sequence just downstream of the S2\u2032 cleavage site with homology to a sequence previously reported to contain the fusion peptide of SARS S. Studies with the relevant peptide showed that it increased the size and deformed the shape of GUVs, consistent with the partition of the peptide into the external leaflet of the lipid membrane, as has been reported for peptides derived from other amphipathic membrane-inserting proteins such as Melittin [24] or Sar1p [29].",
