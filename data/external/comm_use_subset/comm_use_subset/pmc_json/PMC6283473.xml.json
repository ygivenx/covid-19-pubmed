This change provides an avenue to assess the impact of this policy.",

In Singapore, HFMD is endemic with year-round transmission and is legally notifiable by physicians and childcare teachers, as well as actively screened for in preschool-aged children. These policies provide data that enable us to obtain three sources of information on the effect of school closure: 1) the reduction in the numbers of cases after a public holiday, when childcare centers and schools close; 2) the reduction during school vacations; and 3) the impact within childcare centers of school closure in response to an ongoing outbreak. Singapore\u2019s school closure policy for HFMD, which has been implemented for over a decade, in tandem with a comprehensive HFMD surveillance system, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to assess the impact of this important method of outbreak control.",

Because time points not immediately preceding or following a public holiday contribute little information to the effect of the public holiday, rather than considering a time series model, we developed a Bayesian model of the time points surrounding public holidays. The number of cases in the week before the holiday i is modeled as xi\u223cPoisson(\u03b1i\u00d77\u03bc), and the number the week after as yi\u223cPoisson(\u03b1i\u00d7[6\u03bc+\u03b8\u03bc]), or yi\u223cPoisson(\u03b1i\u00d7[5\u03bc+2\u03b8\u03bc]) for two-day-long holidays. Here, \u03bc represents the average number of cases on a typical day; estimates of \u03b8 and a 95% credible interval provide a measure of the public holiday effect (i.e., 1\u2212\u03b8 is the reduction in the number of infections on a public holiday compared with that on a normal day); and \u03b1i\u223c\u0393(a,a) is an individual week effect which has an expected value of 1 and allows for autocorrelation in the time series. The window length of 1 week was selected to ensure balance in the number of weekdays in each window and to correspond roughly to the assumed incubation period of HFMD of around 3\u20137 days.2 This model assumes that the difference between the number of cases prior or after the public holidays is purely because of the difference in the number of infections happening on the public holiday, which is unobservable but indirectly represented by the change in the number of symptomatic cases in the following weeks.",

A negative binomial distribution is used to allow more flexibility to capture the observed variability in the data than that obtained using the Poisson model originally considered. A constant b that does not vary with time was used because Singapore has very little seasonality that would add forcing to the timing of epidemics of HFMD,28 and because it would hamper identifiability of the vacation effect. The adequacy of using a constant b was assessed and confirmed by examining the distribution of the residual of 1-week-ahead model forecasts. The model was fit using Bayesian methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo) with non-informative prior distributions, as described in the Supplemental File.",

In all, 9,903 outbreaks including 100 closures were included in our model: 177 schools without accurate enrolment sizes were removed and four schools with closure falling beyond 50 days after the first day of outbreak were categorized as no closure (detailed in Supplemental File 1). The Bayesian Poisson model shows that the expected number of new cases decreases to 26% (95% CI: 21\u201332%) if a school was closed on that day compared with a normal school day, after adjusting for size and duration of the outbreak. One-day-ahead predictions based on the previous day\u2019s observed number of cases, shown in Figure 2 for arbitrarily selected outbreaks (more outbreaks are presented in Supplemental File 2), both with and without short-term school closure, demonstrate that the fitted model adequately captures the observed outbreak patterns.

Relatively little such evidence is available, though some studies in Japan, France and the United States have assessed school closures in response to influenza outbreaks.18,32 In light of this, the evidence on the effect of closure from Singapore\u2019s long-standing routine school closures to control HFMD may prove valuable.",

A similar reduction in the number of infections during school vacations was also estimated (also about 7%). This may be an underestimate of the actual effect size because many preschool-aged children still attend preschools during school holidays. This hypothesis is supported by the slightly accentuated effect in children who have started formal schooling, with a reduction in risk around 10% for children aged 6 years and older.

This led to a decrease in the number of school closures in the later periods of the study (Table 3). Although not randomized, this change allowed some overlap in the exposure (closure) and response (outbreak growth). The analysis showed that as with holidays and public holidays, school closure during an outbreak had the intended effect of mitigating transmission, but the effect was relatively small, and we estimated that only \u223c1,200 cases were averted over the 6 years analyzed. The high asymptomatic rate33,34 and seroprevalence of the main causative viruses35 may mean that a substantial fraction of children are no longer susceptible by the time of closures in response to large outbreaks, which is currently triggered when more than 16 cases or 23% of children are symptomatic. The fraction of cases prevented by outbreak-induced closure was modeled to be small in general, but larger for the larger preschools, which we attribute to the structure of the thresholds for closure: this is effected when either the fraction or the number of children in the school is notified, meaning that closure of larger schools occurs when the threshold for the number of cases is hit but the fraction is still low. Given the disruptions to parents/families from unplanned closures,11,36 outbreak-driven closures may, therefore, cause more problems than closure because of holidays. In light of the limited effect, it is not clear that this policy should be continued to be used routinely for HFMD outbreaks, but the effect of closures because of holidays suggests that a school closure policy may still be valuable for pandemic preparedness plans and needs to be carried out when there are serious outbreaks or when the outbreak is due to novel pathogens of unknown severity.",

Several assumptions were made in the modeling process: the public holiday effect analysis assumed that the observed difference in the number of cases before and after the public holiday was solely attributable to the public holiday.

Although we found that school closure in response to outbreaks does have a positive effect in reducing transmission, the effect is small, and given the high incidence and the fact that most of the cases of HFMD are mild and self-limiting, the evidence from this study suggests that policy-makers in Singapore should evaluate whether routine use of school closure outside of public health emergencies justifies the impact on families.",
