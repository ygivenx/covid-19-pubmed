Likewise, in this study, the detection limits of 20 of the 22 RAD tests evaluated varied up to 125\u2010fold and two did not detect EIV in undiluted stock virus of 107\u00b77EID50/ml. Only four RAD tests (ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan, Quick chaser Flu A, B and ESPLINE Influenza A&B\u2010N) commercially available were able to detect EIV at 104\u00b79EID50/ml. This indicates the importance of selecting a suitable RAD test when screening for EI, a finding supported by the results of the experimental infection study summarized in Table 2. In that study, a fivefold difference in detection limits between Prorast Flu and the other four RAD tests, ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan, Quick chaser Flu A, B and ESPLINE Influenza A&B\u2010N, resulted in false\u2010negative results with Prorast Flu and a failure to detect EI in the majority of positive nasopharyngeal samples especially on Days 4 and 5. ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan, Quick chaser Flu A, B and ESPLINE Influenza A&B\u2010N performed well, indicating the usefulness of these RADs in the diagnosis of EI in immunologically na\u00efve horses. They typically missed the detection of virus on the first day when all three horses were positive by the molecular tests and virus isolation. However, at this point in time, the horses were showing no clinical signs; therefore if testing due to suspicion of EI, samples would not have been collected on that day. The first day of clinical signs (Day 2) was associated with all four RAD tests successfully detecting virus in all horses. Day 6 was the last day of RAD test positivity, and samples were also culture negative after Day 6. If a RAD test was used to confirm a clinical diagnosis in such horses, it is likely that the traditional guideline of 1 week of complete rest for every day of increased temperature5 would be followed and the horses isolated from other horses. In such a case, the fact that the RAD tests were less sensitive than the rRT\u2010PCR which detected virus up to Day 8 would not have a major practical implication. Furthermore, there was no difference in specificity between the four RAD tests, indicating the low risk of false\u2010positive results.",

These large differences in the sensitivity between the RAD tests and the molecular tests indicate that the latter are the most appropriate tests for EI diagnosis. However, ESPLINE Influenza A&B\u2010N and BD Directigen Flu A (or A+B) were used for the screening of horses in quarantine stations and the identification of infected horses during EI outbreaks.10, 11, 12, 17 Sensitive RAD tests may serve as an adjunct to molecular tests, and positive results are instructive as the specificities of the tests. They are a rapid and easy way to carry out preliminary screening if EI is suspected but are best used in a population of horses rather than in individual cases. Negative test results need to be verified by a molecular test; thus, the RAD tests are unsuitable for testing for freedom of infection prior to movement.",

            "text": "Over the decades, the rapid international movement of horses by air has increased the risk of virus incursions into susceptible population.28, 29 Therefore, the detection of EIV\u2010positive horses in quarantine facilities is an important control measure and the tests need to be of optimum sensitivity. The majority of horses are immunized between 21 and 90 days before shipment either with a primary course or with a booster. Thus, they are likely to shed far less virus than the horses in the experimental study discussed above and may show few or no clinical signs. Furthermore, quarantine periods vary depending on the importing country, the purpose of movement and the status of the exporting country. Thus, the window of opportunity for the detection of EI may be quite short and the nasal swabs may be collected prior to or after virus shedding has peaked. Our results suggest that the molecular diagnosis for EIV is more likely to protect susceptible local populations from the intrusion of EIV than a reliance on RAD tests which are less sensitive. Of the molecular tests used in this study, rRT\u2010PCR appeared to be the most sensitive assay with a detection limit of 102\u00b71EID50/ml, which can be converted to approx. 10\u22120\u00b76EID50/2 \u03bcl/reaction, assuming that the efficiency of RNA extraction is 100%. The RAD tests enable veterinarians and others responsible for the health of horses to perform the rapid diagnosis of EI without special equipment and technical expertise. However, the usage of even the most sensitive RAD tests is best limited to population screening and all negative samples from suspect cases should be submitted to a laboratory for further testing.",

            "text": "In summary, the results of this study indicate that the sensitivities of the 22 RAD tests commercially available in Japan in the detection of EIV vary hugely. Moreover, this study showed that only three of 22 RAD tests, namely ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan and Quick chaser Flu A, B, were substantially fit for diagnosing EI. As the viral nucleoprotein is highly conserved for the last three decades (>98% amino acid homology, data not shown) in EIV (H3N8), sequence diversity should not affect the sensitivity of these RAD tests. However, because these tests are frequently modified and their availability varies from country to country, re\u2010evaluations of their performances may be periodically required in each country. RAD tests are not necessarily performed by equine healthcare professionals, and it is essential that those responsible for screening horses are made aware that the majority of such tests are unsuitable for the detection of EI\u2010infected horses. It is imperative to select an appropriate RAD and to submit negative samples from suspect cases to a laboratory for confirmatory testing.",
