Instead, influenza B obtains its genetic variation mainly through genetic drift, including nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions, which explains the slower molecular evolutionary rate and smaller capacity to cause seasonal ARI outbreaks compared to influenza A.13, 14 Genetic reassortment of influenza B genetic components was previously documented15; however, its frequency is not as high as that of influenza A due to its limited animal reservoir.",

The median age in influenza B ARI group was older than non\u2010influenza B ARIs, and influenza B group presented the higher proportion of family smoking, which is known to be one of the major risk factors for influenza morbidity and mortality.38, 39 Passive smoking from family member might have an effect on suppression of humoral\u2010 and cell\u2010mediated immunity, which makes children more susceptible to influenza infections. However, the mechanism is not fully understood. Passive smoking in general may put children at the risk of ARI hospitalization due to viral infection; however, there is not yet clear evidence regarding the absolute effect of passive smoking on ARI hospitalization in different viral pathogens. The slightly older age of infection by influenza B compared to non\u2010influenza B (22.9 months vs 16.5 months, P < 0.001) may explain an increased susceptibility by passive smoking in older age group. In the future study, we need to follow up children with positive passive smoking status in order to understand the effect of passive smoking on virus\u2010related ARI hospitalization in each virus respectively. Regarding clinical manifestation, influenza B ARI group was less severe than non\u2010influenza B, which might be due to the fact that influenza B ARI cases were relatively older. Also, the higher blood WBC titre in non\u2010influenza B ARI group was most likely due to a certain proportion of bacteria\u2010associated ARIs counted in non\u2010influenza B ARI group.

One possible explanation is the distinct amino acid composition within HA gene of Victoria lineage Groups may possess Group\u2010specific binding preference to sialic acid (SA)\u2010galactose linkage, \u03b12,3 or \u03b12,6. It was previously described that few amino acid substitutions in HA glycoprotein could affect receptor binding specificity.51 For example, Asp\u2010225\u2010Gly substitution of A/H1N1pdm09 strain resulted in increased binding affinity to \u03b12,3\u2010SA linkage, which enhanced disease severity.52, 53, 54 It is important to investigate the clinical role of two amino acid substitutions within major antigenic regions between Victoria lineage Group 1 and 5. Therefore, the pathological and clinical importance of Victoria lineage Group\u2010specific amino acid composition within HA glycoprotein antigenic regions needs to be further investigated.",

Since the presence of an underlying medical condition was described to be one of the major risk factors for developing severe influenza B\u2010related ARI infection,46 our primary clinical finding of the association of Victoria lineage Group 1 with clinical severity, should be carefully interpreted as its severity could have been effected by the higher prevalence of an underlying medical condition in Group 1. Co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses should be taken into account in future analysis as the frequency of co\u2010infection with other respiratory pathogens were relatively high in both WHO Group 1 and 5, rate of which was comparable to previous studies.55, 56 Some previous studies have described the importance of viral co\u2010infection on clinical outcome.57, 58 Bacterial co\u2010infection among influenza ARIs is also known to be the risk factor for developing severe clinical manifestation.59 However, we did not conduct bacteria detection in the current study. Nevertheless, WBC count did not differ among Groups. In future studies, it would be important to elucidate the biological role of bacterial co\u2010infection on influenza B infections. Lastly, we did not obtain clinical data from those who did not require hospitalization, which made it difficult to estimate the clinical importance of influenza B as well as viral transmissibility. In the future study, we would collect data from mild ARIs and healthy children in the target community to gain a better understanding of the clinical role of influenza B.",
