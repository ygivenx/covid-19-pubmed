            "text": "The human astrovirus (HAstV), a member of the Astroviridae family, is a small (28\u201330 nm) non-enveloped virus with a 6.8-kb, positive-sense RNA genome bound at the 5\u2032 end with the viral protein Vpg and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end [1,2]. Human astroviruses cause gastroenteritis and are a leading cause of viral diarrhea in young children. HAstV type 1 (HAstV1) is the most prevalent of the eight known HAstV serotypes in patients with gastroenteritis. The viral genome of HAstV1 encodes two non-structural proteins, nsp1a and nsp1ab, and a structural protein, the viral capsid protein. The nsp1a protein is encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1a, whereas the nsp1ab is produced by a translational frameshifting mechanism that begins by translating ORF1a, and then skips ORF1a\u2019s stop codon by shifting to the overlapping ORF1b [3,4]. The nsp1a and nsp1ab polyproteins catalyze their own proteolytic processing to produce functional viral proteins, including Vpg and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [5]. These viral proteins are believed to concertedly modulate cellular function to facilitate viral propagation and directly participate in viral RNA replication [2]. The viral capsid protein, encoded by ORF2, is translated as an 87-kDa protein that undergoes maturational processing by cellular enzymes and trypsin to become the functional viral capsid [6,7]. The progeny virions produced in the host cell can be released without cell lysis, which appears to be linked to processing of the viral capsid protein by cellular caspases and may involve cellular apoptotic events [8-10].",

PI3K is activated when the Src homology domain of its regulatory subunit, p85, binds to auto-phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptors, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, or some viral proteins in the cytoplasm [14]. The catalytic subunit of the activated PI3K, p110, then converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into the lipid messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates the downstream targets of PI3K. A primary target is Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase that modulates diverse signaling pathways, such as cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis [15]. The binding of PIP3 allows Akt to form a complex with PDK-1, which phosphorylates and activates Akt [15]. Another important target of PI3K is Rac1, a small G-protein involved in cytoskeletal remodeling during lamellipodium formation, cell-to-cell contact, and cell migration [16,17]. PIP3 activates Rac1 by mediating the activation of Rac1-specific guanine exchange factors, such as T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis actor 1 (Tiam1) or Vav1 [16,17].",

A study by Moser and Schultz-Cherry [19] found that ERK1/2 are activated during the initial contact of HAstV with host cells and are important for establishing HAstV infection. In this study, we sought to identify additional signaling pathways that play important roles in HAstV1 infection. Our approach was to use a panel of kinase inhibitors to test whether the specific inhibition of individual signaling pathways interferes with HAstV1 infection. We found that inhibitors of PI3K activation blocked HAstV1 infection, despite the fact that ERK activation was not inhibited. This PI3K activation occurred at an early phase of the infection, and apparently did not involve PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. Thus, our results reveal a previously unknown role of PI3K in HAstV1 infection.",

Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 in the presence or absence of each kinase inhibitor, and the presence of the inhibitor was maintained until 24 hours post-infection (hpi), when the cells were detected for viral capsid protein by immunofluorescence. While DMSO, the solvent for the inhibitors, did not interfere with viral gene expression (Figure 1A, panels A and a), 4 \u03bcM staurosporine (Figure 1A, B and b), a general kinase inhibitor, or 10 \u03bcM genistein (Figure 1A, C and c), a general inhibitor for tyrosine kinases, blocked viral gene expression. We noted that staurosporine treatment caused modest cellular toxicity, evident by nuclear staining with DAPI (Figure 1A, b) and by colorimetric assay for cell viability (Figure 1C). However, the almost complete absence of cells positive for viral antigen suggests that the drug was effective in blocking infection in the cells that survived drug treatment. Consistent with the previously reported requirement for ERK1/2 signaling in HAstV1 infection [19], U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor that blocks ERK1/2 phosphorylation, also blocked viral gene expression (Figure 1A, D and d). Other members of the MAPK family that we tested did not appear to be involved in establishing HAstV1 infection because neither 50 \u03bcM SB 203580, which blocks p38 activation (Figure 1A, E and e), nor 50 \u03bcM JNK inhibitor II, which selectively inhibits JNK (Figure 1A, F and f), had a significant effect on viral capsid gene expression.",

The phosphorylation level of various kinases was examined at different times post-infection by Western blotting for both phosphorylated and phosphorylation-independent epitopes of each kinase (Figure 2A). The signal intensity of each band relative to that of each mock-infected sample at 0.25 hpi is presented in Figure 2C. Compared with that of the mock-infected sample, the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 were noticeably elevated at the early time points (0.25 hpi and 0.5 hpi) (Figure 2A, \u201cpERK\u201d and Figure 2C, \u201cERK\u201d). Similarly, the p38 phosphorylation level appeared to be elevated at 0.25 hpi (Figure 2A, \u201cpp38\u201d and Figure 2C, \u201cp38\u201d). A marginal increase in the phosphorylation level of JNK was observed in the infected cells throughout the time points examined (Figure 2A, \u201cpJNK\u201d and Figure 2C, \u201cJNK\u201d). However, only the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and not that of p38 and JNK, was necessary for infection, judged from the results of the capsid protein expression assay performed with inhibitors specific to these kinases (Figure 1A). We noted that the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased at 8 hpi (Figure 2A, right \u201cpERK\u201d), an observation not reported earlier [19]. This is unlikely to be related to any infection event because phosphorylated ERK1/2 was similarly elevated at this time point in the mock-infected sample (left \u201cpERK\u201d panel).",

To evaluate this possibility, the phosphorylation level of ERK in the presence or the absence of a PI3K blocker was analyzed by Western blotting (Figure 2B). We found that, unlike U0126, which abolished post-infection ERK phosphorylation (Figure 2B, \u201cpERK\u201d panel in the \u201cU0126\u201d group), LY294002 did not affect their phosphorylation (Figure 2B, \u201cpERK\u201d panel of the \u201cLY294002\u201d group).

However, the PKA inhibitor H89 showed some inhibitory effect on extracellular viral RNA accumulation, suggesting that PKA may play a role during virus release from the cell.",

Although the phosphorylation of Akt did not appear to be essential for viral infection, the early time frame of PI3K activation indicated that PI3K was activated during an early phase of infection, perhaps at the step of viral entry. Similarly, ERK activation has been shown to be important early in HAstV1 infection [19].

We also noted that triciribine treatment slightly enhanced cell viability (Figure 1C). Overall, the treatment appeared to have a positive effect on viral propagation in our experiments, rather than an inhibitory effect. Similarly, treatment with NSC23766 or Y27632 increased the extent of viral RNA replication. Interestingly, a marked increase in the phosphorylated Akt level was observed in cells treated with each drug (Additional file 1). Akt activation is known to involve a feedback loop activating Rac1, led by ROCK inhibition using Y27632 [24]. Because Rho-family signaling events are known to involve balanced regulation [24], inhibition of another member of the Rho-family, Rac1, by NSC23766 could also have activated such a feedback loop. The activated Akt possibly caused an increase in protein synthesis, which could enhance viral RNA replication [14].",

The observation that specific, selective PI3K kinase inhibitors did not block ERK phosphorylation, yet exhibited inhibitory effect on infection, indicates that the PI3K-mediated cascade acts independent or downstream of that mediated by ERK (Figure 2B). The involvement of ERK activation is not uncommon in signaling during viral infection. ERK signaling has been shown to be important in the mobilization of receptors for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [28]; in viral gene expression for respiratory syncytial virus [29], human cytomegalovirus [30], and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) [31]; in viral genome replication for the influenza virus [32] and mouse hepatitis virus [33]; in viral assembly for HCV [34]; and in viral release from host cells for Borna disease virus [35]. Similarly, PI3K-Akt activation is needed for viral entry for the influenza virus [36], avian leucosis retrovirus [37], and vaccinia virus [38], all of which are also functionally dependent on Akt activation, unlike the case with HAstV1 infection. An integration of multiple signaling cascades has been shown for KSHV infection, in which the FAK-Src-PI3K-PKC-MEK-ERK cascade is involved in viral early gene expression [39], and the PI3K-Akt-RhoA cascade, but not ERK activation, is important for viral entry [40]. An integration of the PI3K and ERK pathways was not observed in HAstV1 infection; rather, the signaling pathways appeared to be separate. Because such a pattern of kinase activation during infection has not been found for other viruses, our study has uncovered a unique signal transduction strategy of HAstV1 for establishing infection in host cells.",

Note that, due to large differences, the scale of the vertical bar representing \u201cAkt\u201d differs from that of others. (D)Effects of inhibitors on capsid protein expression. Caco-2 cells were infected and examined by immunofluorescence analysis as in Figure 1, except that solvent alone or inhibitors were added at indicated time points and maintained until fixing at 24 hpi. For each time point, the proportions of cells positive for capsid protein expression were examined statistically as described in Methods. (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.001).",

Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 in the absence (Mock) or presence of various kinase inhibitors and examined for the following. (A)Effects on viral RNA replication. Viral RNA replication in the infected cells was analyzed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. For each drug treatment, the quantified amount of viral RNA, normalized to the amount of total RNA, was converted to a value relative to that of mock treatment. The mean relative value from four independent experiments, with the standard deviation indicated as error bar, is presented. (B)Effects on presence of viral RNA in culture supernatant. The level of viral RNA in the post-infection culture supernatant was analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. For each drug treatment, the quantified amount of viral RNA was converted to a value relative to that of mock treatment. The mean relative value from three experiments, with the standard deviation indicated as error bar, is presented. (C)Effects on presence of viral capsid protein in culture supernatant. The level of viral capsid antigen in the post-infection culture supernatant was measured using ELISA. The supernatant samples were prepared in triplicate, and the mean capsid antigen level for each drug treatment was further converted to a value relative to mock treatment. Statistically significant differences, determined as in Figure 2D, are indicated on the graphs.",
