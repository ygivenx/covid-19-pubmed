            "text": "Human coronaviruses are common cold viruses that are frequently found to be associated with acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) [1]. According to the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) belong to the betacoronavirus genus, a member of the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses contain the largest RNA genomes and have been established as one of the rapidly evolving viruses [2]. In addition to the high nucleotide substitution rates across the genome [3], the coronavirus genome is subjected to homologous recombination during viral replication, which is caused by RNA template switching mediated by the copy-choice mechanism [4, 5]. The genetic recombination of coronaviruses had possibly led to the emergence of lethal pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused up to 50 % mortality in infected individuals [6\u20139]. Recombination events in the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) within the 1a gene of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 leading to the emergence of unique recombinant genotypes have been reported [10, 11].",

In humans, acute upper respiratory symptoms such as nasal congestion and rhinorrhea are relatively common in HCoV infections while sore throat and hoarseness of voice are less common, with cough usually associated with HCoV-OC43 infection [14]. In tropical countries, annual shift in the predominant genotype has been documented, with more cases of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections reported during the early months of the year [15]. Despite the clinical importance and socioeconomic impact of HCoV infections [16, 17], the prevalence, seasonality, clinical and phylogenetic characteristics of HCoVs remain largely unreported in the tropical region of Southeast Asia. Based on the S, N and 1a genes of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 isolated from Malaysia and also globally, we attempted to delineate the genetic history and the phylodynamic profiles of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 using a suite of Bayesian phylogenetic tools. We also reported the emergence of two novel HCoV-OC43 lineages, in a cross-sectional study of patients presented with acute URTI in Malaysia.",

The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run was set at 3 \u00d7 106 steps long sampled every 10,000 state. The trees were annotated using Tree Annotator program included in the BEAST package, after a 10 % burn-in, and visualized in FigureTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/Figuretree/). Neighbor joining (NJ) trees for the partial S (S1 domain), complete N and partial 1a (nsp3) genes were also reconstructed, using Kimura 2-parameter model in MEGA 5.1 [35]. The reliability of the branching order was evaluated by bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates. In addition, to explore the genetic relatedness between HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 genotypes, the pairwise genetic distances among sequences of the S gene were estimated. Inter- and intra-genotype nucleotide distances were estimated by the bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates using MEGA 5.1. Such analysis has not been done for the N and the 1a genes because those regions were highly conserved across genotypes [10, 11, 32]. To test for the presence of recombination in HCoV-OC43, the S gene was subjected to pairwise distance-based bootscanning analysis using SimPlot version 3.5 [10, 36]. Established reference genomes for HCoV-OC43 genotype A (ATCC VR-759), B (87309 Belgium 2003), and C (HK04-01) were used as putative parental lineages, with a sliding window and step size of 160 bp and 20 bp, respectively. In addition, MaxChi recombination test [37] was performed in the Recombination Detection Program (RDP) version 4.0 [38]. In RDP the highest acceptable p value (the probability that sequences could share high identities in potentially recombinant regions by chance alone) was set at 0.05, with the standard multiple comparisons corrected using the sequential Bonferroni method with 1,000 permutations [39].",

Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the S gene, one subject (1/23, 4.3 %) was grouped with HCoV-OC43 genotype B reference sequences while another subject (1/23, 4.3 %) was grouped with HCoV-OC43 genotype D sequences. The remaining 21 isolates formed two phylogenetically discrete clades that were distinct from other previously established genotypes A, B, C, D (genotype D is a recombinant lineage that is not readily distinguished from genotype C in the S and N phylogenetic trees) and E [11, 32] (Fig. 2 and Additional file 1: Figure S1). Of the 21 isolates, ten isolates have formed a cluster with other recently reported isolates from Japan, Thailand and China [31, 32] supported by the posterior probability value of 1.0 and bootstrap value of 36 % at the internal tree node of the MCC and NJ trees, respectively with intra-group pairwise genetic distance of 0.003 \u00b1 0.001. These isolates were provisionally designated as novel lineage 1. Spatial structure was observed within novel lineage 1, with an isolate from China sampled in year 2008 located at the base of the phylogeny. Moreover, another eleven HCoV-OC43 isolates have formed a second distinct cluster supported by significant posterior probability and bootstrap values at the internal tree node (1.0 and 98 %, respectively) and intra-group pairwise genetic distance of 0.004 \u00b1 0.001. The cluster contained Malaysian and Chinese isolates [32] only, and was denoted as novel lineage 2. Based on the phylogenetic inference of the conserved N gene, only one subject was grouped with the genotype B reference in concordance with the S gene (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Unlike the phylogenetic inference of the S gene, the remaining 22 isolates were seen intermingled with each other forming a single cluster together with isolates indicated as novel lineages 1 and 2 in the S gene, in addition to one genotype D strain. It is however important to note that the tree resolution was poor, due primarily to the lack of the N gene reference sequences in the public database. On the other hand, phylogenetic analysis of the 1a (nsp3) gene (Additional file 3: Figure S3) revealed that all except genotype A could not be differentiated clearly within this region, due mainly to the low genetic diversity between genotypes. The limited number of 1a reference sequences available in the public database could have also resulted in a poor 1a tree topology. In addition, phylogenetic trees of previously described complete and partial S gene sequences as well as partial 1a (nsp3) and complete RdRp gene sequences were reconstructed to further confirm the reliability of the partial S1 and nsp3 for identification of HCoV-OC43 genotypes (Additional file 4: Figure S4 and Additional file 5: Figure S5).",

Divergence time of genotype A was dated back to early 1960s, followed by genotype B around 1990s. Interestingly, genotypes C, D, E, and novel lineages 1 and 2 were all traced back to the 2000s (Fig. 2). Moreover, the common ancestor of HCoV-HKU1 was traced back to early 1950s, as estimated from the S gene. Subsequently, HCoV-HKU1 continued to diverge further into distinctive genotypes (A-C). Genotype A was dated to the late 1990 and genotypes B and C were both traced back to early 2000s (Fig. 3). Bayes factor analysis showed insignificant differences (Bayes factor <3.0) between the constant and exponential coalescent models of demographic analysis. Divergence times generated using the exponential tree model were slightly (but not significantly) different from those estimated using the constant coalescent model (Table 4). Of note, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 genotype assignments were less distinctive within the N and 1a genes (as compared to the S gene); these regions were therefore deemed unsuitable for divergence time estimations in this study.",

These estimates corroborate with the previously reported average incidence of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 at 0.2\u20134.3 % and 0.3\u20134.4 %, respectively [12, 15, 40\u201345]. Although HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are not as common as other respiratory viruses, several studies have reported an elevated incidence of HCoV-OC43 (up to 67 %) due to sporadic outbreaks with fatality rate up to 8 % [46, 47]. This 12-month study showed that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections were frequently detected during March 2012 to September 2012 and decreased thereafter, in line with findings reported from other tropical Southeast Asian country [15]. However, such patterns differ from that in temperate areas where the prevalence peaks during winter seasons, but few or no detections in the summer [43]. It is also important to note that the study was performed in a relatively short duration, therefore limiting the epidemiological and disease trend comparison with reports from other countries.",

Inter-genotype genetic distances between HCoV-OC43 genotypes further supported that the novel lineages 1 and 2 are distinct from the previously described genotypes [11, 17, 32] in which the genetic distances between each of these two genotypes and the others were notably high (up to 3.2 %) (Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that novel lineage 1 includes isolates from Malaysia, Thailand, China and Japan while novel lineage 2 isolates are all from Malaysia and China. Spatiotemporal characteristic observed within the novel lineage 1 phylogeny (Fig. 2) may suggest the origin of this lineage in China, before it spread to other regions in the East and Southeast Asia. In order to clearly define the genetic characteristic of the putative novel lineages 1 and 2 (and also any other isolates with discordant phylogenetic patterns), complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis need to be carried out.",

Furthermore, the divergence times of HCoV-OC43 genotypes predicted in this study are comparable to those described in previous studies [11, 27]. Phylogenetic, recombination and molecular clock analysis suggest the emergence of novel lineages 1 and 2 around the mid-2000s and late 2000s, respectively, probably by natural recombination events involving genotypes B and C (for lineage 1) and genotypes A and B (for lineage 2).",
