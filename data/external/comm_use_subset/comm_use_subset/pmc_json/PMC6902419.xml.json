In addition, the data generated through the surveillance system were considered key to potentially inform and promote prevention interventions. The ISSS was coordinated and implemented by three institutions, namely: the Kinshasa School of Public Health (KSPH), the Direction de la Lutte contre les Maladies (DLM) and the Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB).

At each sentinel site trained staff (i.e., doctors, nurses or laboratory technicians) would: (i) screen, identify and enroll patients, (ii) compile individual-level screening and enrollment logbooks for patients meeting the SARI and ILI case definitions, (iii) collect upper respiratory tract (URT) samples from enrolled ILI and SARI cases, (vi) complete the individual case investigation form (CIF) for enrolled ILI and SARI cases, (v) store, package and ship URT samples, (vi) collect weekly and monthly aggregated data on the total number of any, respiratory (including those that met the ILI and SARI case definitions), gastrointestinal and malaria outpatient consultations and hospitalizations; and (vii) liaise with the national influenza surveillance focal points on all matters related to influenza surveillance implemented at the sentinel sites, including requests for surveillance material. No monetary incentive was provided to the influenza focal points. Airtime was provided for communication between sentinel sites and national focal points.

For qualitative indicators a score was assigned based on the same scale using expert consensus. Thereafter the scores assigned to each indicator were averaged for all indicators evaluated within each attribute to provide an overall score for each surveillance attribute assessed in this study. An overall score for the surveillance system was obtained by averaging the eight mean attribute scores.

Whereas the surveillance system was implemented in five of six target provinces, six of 11 provinces of the country were not covered. Adding additional surveillance sites could improve representativeness; however, this would also increase costs and logistical difficulties. Given that the existing system met the surveillance objectives (especially those related to seasonal influenza), adding surveillance sites in other provinces is not recommended. The identification of avian influenza viruses\u2019 infection in humans (one of the objectives of the surveillance system) through facility-based sentinel surveillance remains challenging due to the limited number of surveillance sites that can be supported with limited resources. Close collaboration with the animal health authorities and the joint investigation of animal and human populations during identified avian influenza outbreaks in birds would represent a more cost-effective strategy to identify potential zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses.",

The stability of most surveillance systems in the African region is related to human and financial resources. The stability of the ISSS in DRC is probably reliant on its simplicity that resulted in the acceptability of surveillance activities by surveillance staff. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the system may have affected the extent of information collected. Not all minimum data collection requirements suggested by WHO for influenza sentinel surveillance [1] were met. The collection of additional data about underlying medical conditions may allow, for instance, the identification of more vulnerable populations for severe influenza-associated illness that in return could guide targeted prevention measures such as annual influenza immunization [16, 17]. Nevertheless, the introduction of more intense data gathering should be weighed against its impact on acceptability. Whereas the system overall was stable, logistical constrains in terms of power supply and transport of samples were identified. The simplicity and acceptability of the system as well as the periodic supervision of the sentinel sites may also have contributed to the observed good quality and completeness of the data. Nonetheless, the ISSS in DRC is largely reliant on external funds (> 90%) and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds should be evaluated and/or contemplated as lack of external funds could impact the stability of the system.",
