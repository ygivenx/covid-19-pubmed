Since then, 2100 confirmed cases and 730 deaths have been reported, with an estimated mortality rate of ~36% (http://www.who.int/csr/don/10-november-2017-mers-oman/en/). Currently, MERS-CoV remains a public health threat, as new infections continue to occur and no approved vaccines or antivirals are available. Furthermore, MERS-CoV is endemic in camels, making it likely that the virus will be an ongoing concern. Evidence from a number of studies has demonstrated that MERS-CoV strongly inhibits IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production [1\u20133], although our knowledge on how the virus interferes with the host antiviral response is still limited. The contribution of viral proteins to the inhibition of the innate antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses has been mainly addressed in cells overexpressing individual viral proteins, not in the context of virus infection.",

            "text": "The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) family of proteins are critical regulators of both innate and adaptive immunity [4]. In na\u00efve cells, NF-\u03baB proteins are present in the cytoplasm in association with inhibitory proteins (I\u03baBs). Cellular stimuli, including pathogens and stress, induce I\u03baB phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, releasing NF-\u03baB proteins and allowing their nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, NF-\u03baB proteins promote the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, stress-response proteins, and anti-apoptotic proteins. NF-\u03baB activity is essential for lymphocyte survival and activation, and for initiating and propagating optimal immune responses. By contrast, the constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway is often associated with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Exacerbated NF-\u03baB activity has been demonstrated to be important for the inflammatory immunopathology induced by respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [5, 6] and influenza A virus [7]. Here, we found that nuclear MERS-CoV 4b protein contributes to the inhibition of the host NF-\u03baB-mediated pro-inflammatory response by preventing the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, we identified karyopherin-\u03b14 (importin-\u03b13), which is responsible for the nuclear import of NF-\u03baB, as a 4b binding protein. We found that 4b binding to karyopherin-\u03b14 inhibited its interaction with NF-\u03baB-p65 subunit, thus preventing NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and, as a consequence, expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection. The ability of 4b to block NF-\u03baB is likely to be relevant for MERS-CoV-induced in vivo pathology and virulence.",

Viruses deleted in the accessory proteins, like the parental virus [3], were unable to induce IFN (S1 Fig) in contrast to the effective induction of IFN-\u03b2 by poly(I:C) transfection, implying that additional proteins expressed by the virus act as IFN antagonists [9]. Interestingly, dual deletion of genes 4a and 4b led to a significant increase in the expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 as compared to the wild-type infection (S1 Fig). Since the transcription of these genes depends on NF-\u03baB [4], these results suggested that one or both proteins repressed NF-\u03baB activation during MERS-CoV infection.",

The 4a and 4b genes have overlapping coding sequences and are expressed from the same subgenomic mRNA, and thus 4b is likely expressed by either internal ribosomal entry or \u201cleaky scanning\u201d of ribosomes [10]. The 4a deletion preserved the transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) preceding 4a gene, which comprise the conserved sequence (CS), and 26 nt downstream of the CS, including the first 22 nt of ORF 4a. In addition, the 3\u2019 101 nt of the 4a gene preceding ORF 4b were maintained in order to preserve translation of 4b protein, as suggested for other CoV ORFs that are translated by similar mechanisms [11]. In the case of MERS-CoV-\u03944b the 4b gene was almost entirely deleted excluding the 4a/4b overlapping sequences and the 3\u2019 most 53 nt, in order to maintain the TRS for transcription of gene 5 (Fig 1A). MERS-CoV-\u03944a and MERS-CoV-\u03944b were recovered from plasmids pBAC-MERSFL-\u03944a and pBAC-MERSFL-\u03944b, respectively, in Huh-7 cells with titers similar to those of wild-type virus. After two passages in cell culture, the recombinant viruses were sequenced to confirm their stability. The replication kinetics of these singly mutated viruses in Huh-7 cells was not significantly different from that of the wild-type virus (Fig 1B), with only a slight decrease in titers at some time points. These results confirm that proteins 4a and 4b were not required for virus replication in cell culture [8]. The presence or absence of 4b and 4a proteins in Huh-7 cells infected with the recombinant viruses MERS-CoV-\u03944a, MERS-CoV-\u03944b and MERS-CoV-\u03944ab was confirmed by Western-blot and immunofluorescence assays. The expression levels of 4a and 4b proteins (A in S2 Fig) and their subcellular distribution (B and C in S2 Fig) were similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that 4a and 4b gene expression was not affected in the deletion mutants. While 4a protein showed a cytoplasmic distribution [9, 12, 13] partially colocalizing with viral dsRNA, 4b protein localized to the nucleus of infected cells, as previously described [10].",

A recombinant MERS-CoV-DUP cDNA with a 189 nt duplication including the 4a/4b overlapping sequences (88 bp) and 4a preceding sequences (101 bp), likely required for 4b translation, was generated as a control (DUP, Fig 2A). Two mutant MERS-CoV cDNAs including the 4a/4b duplication were then engineered either containing alanine mutations of NLS-S1 (RKR\u2192AAA, MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1), or both the intermediate Lys residues and NLS-S2 (KK\u2192AA and KRR\u2192AAA, MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S2). Recombinant viruses were rescued from infectious cDNAs in Huh-7 cells and the expression of 4a and 4b proteins was characterized. No significant differences in the expression levels of 4a and 4b proteins in Huh-7 cells were observed by Western-blot analysis, as compared to the wild-type virus (A in S3 Fig), confirming that genome engineering of 4b NLS mutants did not affect virus gene expression. Accordingly, the cytoplasmic distribution of 4a protein observed in MERS-CoV-wild-type-infected cells was not affected in the NLS mutants (B in S3 Fig). Analysis by confocal microscopy of 4b subcellular localization (Fig 2B) confirmed that 4b protein was mostly detected in the nucleus in MERS-CoV-DUP-infected cells, as observed in cells infected with wild-type virus. In contrast, mutation of 4b NLS-S1 in MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1 prevented the nuclear localization of 4b, which was mainly restricted to the cytoplasm. Mutation of NLS-S2 in MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S2 only partially prevented the nuclear import of 4b, with protein detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These results demonstrated that in the context of infection, 4b NLS-S1 was essential for nuclear localization, while NLS-S2 had only a partial effect on 4b nuclear import, as described in 4b overexpression experiments [10]. The growth kinetics of MERS-CoV NLS mutants in Huh-7 and Calu-3 (a bronchial epithelial cell line) cells (Fig 2C and C in S3 Fig) confirmed that neither the duplication of 4a-4b sequences nor the mutation of 4b NLS-S1 or NLS-S2 affected viral replication as compared to the wild-type virus. This indicates that the nuclear localization of 4b protein during infection did not have a significant impact on virus replication in cell culture.",

Mutation of NLS-S2, leading to a partially nuclear 4b protein, increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines to intermediate levels as compared to the NLS-S1 mutation. These results indicated that nuclear translocation of 4b was required to inhibit the expression of NF-\u03baB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines both in Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells, suggesting that this effect might be relevant in the natural infection.

No differences in p65 levels were observed among MERS-CoV mutants regardless of the NF-\u03baB-mediated response (Fig 3D). Since activation of NF-\u03baB requires the degradation of the inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1, levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 were analyzed by Western-blot in cells infected with 4b-mutant MERS-CoVs (A in S4 Fig). It was difficult to detect I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in the context of viral infection, most likely indicating that activation of the pathway was not complete. Alternatively, activated NF-\u03baB has been reported to rapidly induce expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 to restore NF-\u03baB inhibition [15]. To examine the impact of viral infection on I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, we further treated infected cells with TNF-\u03b1 for different time periods at 14 hours post-infection, which is expected to induce a sustained reduction in I\u03baB\u03b1 levels. At this time point, significant levels of 4b had accumulated (B in S4 Fig), providing a scenario where we could evaluate potential inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation by 4b. Degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in infected cells treated with TNF-\u03b1 was associated with induction of pro-inflammatory mRNAs, thus confirming that TNF-\u03b1 activated the NF-\u03baB pathway (C in S4 Fig). Furthermore, 4b protein significantly reduced the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by TNF-\u03b1 in infected cells as compared to infection with \u03944b virus, reinforcing the potential of 4b protein to repress the NF-\u03baB response (C in S4 Fig). However, no differences in I\u03baB\u03b1 levels were observed in infections with \u03944b and 4b NLS-mutant MERS-CoVs after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, suggesting that the 4b protein did not inhibit the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig 3E and A in S4 Fig). Together, these results indicated that inhibition of the NF-\u03baB response by the 4b protein did not occur at steps prior to the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB.",

The latter interacts with nucleoporins to promote nuclear import [16]. Since MERS-CoV 4b protein includes a bipartite NLS and localizes to the nucleus during infection, we tested whether the bipartite NLS sequences of 4b were required for KPNA4 binding. The basic amino acids in NLS-S1 or NLS-S2 were replaced with alanine in plasmids (4b-mNLS-S1\u2013FLAG or 4b-mNLS-S2\u2013FLAG) and subsequently transfected into Huh-7 cells.

Endogenous KPNA4 did not co-immunoprecipitate with 4b proteins mutated either in NLS-S1 or NLS-S2, in contrast to wild-type 4b protein. This indicates that MERS-CoV 4b protein requires both NLS-S1 and NLS-S2 for efficient interaction with KPNA4.

In our screen, 4b protein only pulled down importin-\u03b12 subfamily members (S5 Fig), which are known to bind NF-\u03baB. To directly test whether 4b preferentially interacted with importin-\u03b12 subfamily proteins, we analyzed the ability of 4b protein to interact with \u03b1-karyopherins of each subfamily. KPNA1 (importin-\u03b13 subfamily), KPNA2 (importin-\u03b11 subfamily), and KPNA3 and KPNA4 (importin-\u03b12 subfamily) were expressed as KPNA-FLAG fusion proteins in Huh-7 cells along with HA-tagged 4b protein. Cells were collected 48 hours post-transfection and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The presence of KPNA and 4b protein was detected by Western-blot with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies, respectively (Fig 5A). Quantification of relative binding to each karyopherin (Fig 5B) showed that 4b protein preferentially bound to KPNA4, and to a lesser extent, KPNA3. Binding of 4b protein to karyopherin-\u03b1 family members during infection was assayed in a similar fashion. Huh-7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing KPNA-FLAG fusion proteins and infected 48 hours later with wild-type MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. Cells were collected at 20 hpi and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed with anti-4b and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig 5C). In the context of infection, MERS-CoV 4b protein also preferentially bound to KPNA4 over all other karyopherins, including KPNA3 (Fig 5C and 5D). However, 4b could at least minimally bind to other KPNAs, possibly explaining the ability of 4b-mNLS-S2 to partially access the nucleus. The favorable interaction between 4b and KPNA4 is consistent with the idea that 4b prevented the nuclear import of NF-\u03baB by binding to KPNA4 [18].",

Additionally, during MERS-CoV infection, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was inhibited in the presence of wild-type nuclear 4b protein, in contrast to 4b cytoplasmic mutants. Therefore, we hypothesized that in infected cells, wild type 4b protein would interfere with NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. To test this possibility, we analyzed the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of 4b and the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit at 24 hpi in Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells infected at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell either with wild-type MERS-CoV or with MERS-CoV recombinant viruses expressing cytoplasmic 4b-NLS mutant proteins. Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and confocal microscopy analysis showed that during infection with the control viruses, MERS-CoV-wild-type or DUP, 4b protein mainly localized to the nucleus while most of the p65 protein was detected in the cytoplasm (Fig 6A\u20136C and S6 Fig). In contrast, in infections either with MERS-CoV-\u03944b or MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1, p65 was detected both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S2 infection, the dual distribution of 4b protein between the nucleus and the cytoplasm was associated with the presence of p65 in both cellular compartments. This observation suggested that partial access to the nucleus of 4b-mNLS-S2 was enough to allow a significant increase in p65 nuclear import as compared to that observed in the presence of nuclear wild-type 4b protein. Together, these results indicated that 4b protein with an intact NLS prevented nuclear import of NF-\u03baB in Huh-7 cells and in the physiologically relevant Calu-3 cells, suggesting that this mechanism might also be critical in a natural lung infection.",

To address this question, co-IP experiments with FLAG antibodies in Huh-7 cells transfected with a KPNA4-FLAG plasmid and infected with MERS-CoVs expressing 4b-NLS mutant proteins were performed. These results confirmed that binding of KPNA4 to 4b protein was also NLS-dependent in the context of infection (Fig 7). Interestingly, in wild-type MERS-CoV-infected cells, immunoprecipitation of KPNA4 did not pull-down p65 while it did it in \u03944b and 4b NLS mutant virus infected cells.

To date, all studies involving MERS-CoV proteins and their interactions with the innate immune response have been done with viral proteins expressed in isolation [10, 12, 13, 19, 20]. These studies can give a glimpse into the mechanisms used by the virus to block interferon and other innate immune factors. However, proteins expressed in isolation may not function as they do in the context of an infection, due to excessive protein production, improper localization, or the presence/absence of specific cellular or viral proteins [21]. Previous reports indicated that when expressed in isolation, 4b blocked IFN expression induced by Sendai virus (SeV) or by overexpression of cellular factors that function in the IFN-induction pathways [20]. Inhibition of IRF-3 or IRF-7-induced IFN production required the NLS sequences of 4b, whereas deletion of 4b NLS did not affect IFN expression induced by other factors such as MDA5, MAVS, IKK\u03b5 and TBK-1. These results suggested that 4b could inhibit the induction of IFN-\u03b2 in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here, we show that MERS-CoV-\u03944b infection did not induce IFN in Huh-7 cells, while a limited IFN response was observed in Calu-3 cells, suggesting that additional mechanisms independent of 4b expression are used by MERS-CoV to inhibit IFN production [3, 22, 23].",

We found that 4b was required to prevent a robust NF-\u03baB dependent response during infection of both Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells (S1 Fig and Fig 1C). This function required the NLS sequences of 4b, as opposed to a previous report [10], in which overexpressed 4b proteins lacking the NLS were still able to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 induction and to a lesser extent NF-\u03baB signaling. Importantly, we found that the nuclear localization of 4b was associated with the cytoplasmic retention of NF-\u03baB (Fig 6) and consequently, with the repression of NF-\u03baB-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig 3A and 3C). We also found that both in isolation and during infection, 4b interacted with \u03b1-karyopherin proteins in an NLS-dependent manner. Interestingly, 4b had a strong preference for binding karyopherin-\u03b14, which is also known to translocate the NF-\u03baB protein into the nucleus [18]. Interestingly, 4b binding to KPNA4 during infection inhibited its interaction with NF-\u03baB-p65 subunit (Fig 7). Thereby we propose a model where 4b outcompetes NF-\u03baB for KPNA4 binding and translocation into the nucleus (Fig 8). Alternatively, other functions of 4b or additional MERS-CoV proteins might also contribute to the NF-\u03baB antagonism, as described for other coronaviruses, which include multiple proteins that antagonize the host IFN and NF-\u03baB responses [22, 27].",

RNase L is an effector of the IFN-induced antiviral response and cleaves viral and host single-stranded RNA, leading to cell death and preventing viral replication and spread. Nuclear localization of 4b is exceptional among the other known viral PDEs, found in the cytoplasm. However, in the context of MHV infection, minor expression levels of MERS-CoV 4b in the cytoplasm are sufficient to prevent RNase L activation and, in fact, removal of the NLS did not improve RNase L antagonism. The relevance of 4b PDE activity to promote MERS-CoV replication requires further confirmation in appropriate cell types. Our results here and this previous study [28] suggest that 4b protein would provide MERS-CoV with multiple mechanisms for evasion of innate immunity, such as the repression of the NF-\u03baB-mediated response and the inhibition of RNase L activation.",

Some CoV genus-specific proteins, such as MERS-CoV 4b and SARS-CoV 3b, localize to the nucleus [10, 12, 20, 30], although their precise effect on host nuclear processes is still unknown. The nucleocapsid (N) and nsp1 proteins have also been detected in the nucleus, although this is not a conserved property in all CoVs. N protein nuclear localization has been related to cell cycle arrest and recruitment to the cytoplasm of nuclear proteins involved in viral RNA synthesis [29, 31]. The presence in the nucleus of MERS-CoV nsp1 has been involved in the selective inhibition of nuclear-transcribed mRNA expression [32], while porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp1 mediates the degradation of CREB-binding protein in the nucleus, thus suppressing IFN I production [33]. CoV nsp1 and SARS-CoV ORF 3b proteins are sufficiently small to diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complex [30, 32]. In contrast, nuclear import of larger proteins such as N and MERS-CoV 4b require host transporters and is mediated by NLS sequences [34].",

Viruses have evolved different mechanisms to subvert nucleo-cytoplasmic transport by targeting soluble transport receptors such as karyopherins as well as components of the nuclear pore complexes (NPC).

Herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein interacts with the nucleoporin Nup62, an structural component of the NPC, leading to the inhibition of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport pathways mediated by transportin or importins [36]. Similarly, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BGLF4 kinase interacts with the nucleoporins Nup62 and Nup153 inhibiting canonical NLS-mediated nuclear import while promoting the nuclear import of non-NLS-containing EBV lytic proteins [37].",

A similar mechanism of inhibition has also been described for Ebola virus VP24 [41]. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection suppresses IFN responses by inhibiting STAT1/2 nuclear transport through the induction of caspase-3-dependent degradation of KPNA1 [42]. Poliovirus and rhinovirus infection induce proteolysis of the NPC components Nup153 and p62, leading to a general inhibition of nuclear import [43, 44]. The association of viral proteins with the host nuclear import pathway confirms its relevance in virus-host interactions, regulating innate immunity and cellular responses to infection.",

Japanese encephalitis virus NS5 competitively inhibits NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation by binding to KPNA2, 3 and 4, presumably through two NLSs within NS5, which surprisingly does not accumulate in the nucleus [46].

Dual regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling during HCoV-229E infection has been described, consisting in the simultaneous induction of the NF-\u03baB pathway, which has a pro-viral effect, and the restriction of the NF-\u03baB response to limit transcription of pro-inflammatory and other potentially antiviral host cell genes [48].

Cells were collected 48 hours later and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described above. Viral protein 4a and cell proteins actin and GAPDH have been used as controls for non-specific binding to KPNA4-FLAG or to FLAG-antibody coated beads.
