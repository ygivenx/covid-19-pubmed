To investigate the role of HCMV in oncogenesis, non-transformed human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with a GFP-tagged laboratory strain of wild-type HCMV (WT-HCMV), AD169 (MOI 5). On second day post infection (dpi), virus infection was observed by GFP fluorescence (Figure 1a). On sixth dpi, infected cells showed a characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) and also change in growth media color (red to yellow) (Figure 1b). The color change owing at least in part to release of marker GFP from infected cells but also may indicate enhanced metabolic activity during infection. To evaluate the possibility more directly, we performed an MTT assay comparing infected cells with uninfected. A fourfold higher metabolic activity was observed for WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells (Figure 1c). In addition, an enhanced level of RNA and protein of MKi67, a cell proliferation marker gene, was observed in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs compared with uninfected HFFs (Figures 1d and e), consistent with the result of MTT assay. This led us to further investigate the cell cycle stages of HCMV-infected cells by flowcytometry, which showed a detectable skewing pattern toward G2-phase in infected cells than in uninfected cells (Figure 1f).",

The cell death is triggered through activation of apoptotic pathways, however, HCMV infection increased cell survival via significantly enhancing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl2, birc3 and prkce, compared with mock infection (Figure 1g), indicating that HCMV infection protects cells from apoptosis and promotes cell survival. During cancer progression, expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic genes is modulated to support cancer progression. Most often increase in expression of anti-apoptotic genes and decrease in expression of pro-apoptotic genes favor cancer progression.

We hypothesized that HCMV-DUB may also have such a role. To test this, we used a previously reported HCMV mutant virus that encodes an inactive DUB.19 After infecting HFFs with equal amount of WT and DUB-mutant (\u0394DUB) GFP-tagged HCMV, an equal amount of virus infection (GFP Fluorescence) was observed on second dpi (Figure 2a). On sixth dpi, \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected cells showed much less-metabolic activity than WT-HCMV-infected cells, however, comparable to mock infected cells (Figure 2b). To confirm the differential responses of WT- and \u0394DUB-HCMV, MTT assay and MKi67 transcript and protein analysis were performed for cell metabolic activity and cell proliferation, respectively, which indicated that \u0394DUB-HCMV reduced cell metabolic activity and proliferation compared with WT-HCMV (Figures 2c\u2013e). Furthermore, HFF cell counting and cell cycle analysis after three dpi with HCMV, revealed that WT-HCMV infection causes enhanced cell proliferation (Figure 2f) and more cell accumulation in the G2-phase compared with mock or \u0394DUB-HCMV infection (Figure 2g).",

The IMR32 cells, stably expressing WT-UL48N showed rapid proliferation than those stably expressing either \u0394DUB-UL48N or Vec (Figure 2h). This was further confirmed by cell cycle analysis of IMR32 cells, which showed an enhanced accumulation of UL48N expressing IMR32 cells in S- and G2-phases compared with Vec and UL48N\u0394DUB (Figure 2i).

To understand whether HCMV-DUB modulates pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic gene expressions during infection, WT-HCMV and \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs were first analyzed for the expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic genes through qPCR, on 6th dpi. Transcription of anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl2, birc3, prkce, survivin and xiap was significantly increased by many folds, in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs, however the transcript level remained either unchanged or reduced in \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs compared with mock (Figure 3a). Furthermore, protein-expression analysis of anti-apoptotic genes\u2013bcl2, birc3 and survivin\u2013showed an increased expression in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs than in mock or \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs (Figure 3c). Expression level of few other anti-apoptotic genes such as ciap1, cflip and mcl-1 decreased in case of both, WT and \u0394DUB-HCMV infection compared with mock infection (Supplementary Figures S1a\u2013S1c), which suggests HCMV-DUB has no specific role in regulating these anti-apoptotic genes. Surprisingly, transcript level of bcl-xl anti-apoptotic gene was reduced owing to WT-HCMV infection, whereas remained unchanged upon \u0394DUB-HCMV infection (Supplementary Figure S1d). Similarly, transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as trail, Rb, p53, fadd and tnf\u03b1, remained either unchanged, less induced or reduced in WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with mock, whereas expression of these pro-apoptotic genes was higher in the \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected cells (Figure 3b). The p53 protein was induced upon infection with both WT- and \u0394DUB-HCMV, however induction was comparatively less in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs (Figure 3c). Transcription of few other pro-apoptotic genes such as bad and bax was decreased upon infection with both, WT- and \u0394DUB-HCMV, suggesting no specific role of HCMV-DUB in regulating bad and bax, whereas transcription of caspase-8, and p21 was reduced only in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs, and remained unchanged in \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs (Supplementary Figures S1f\u2013S1i). Furthermore, protein analysis of p21 and caspase-3 showed a decreased expression in WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with mock (Figure 3c). The expression of several other anti- and pro-apoptotic genes was tested, with no evidence of differences between WT- and \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected cells compared with mock (Supplementary Figures S1e, S1j\u2013S1l) suggesting no involvement of HCMV infection to regulation of these genes. Differential expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic genes during WT-HCMV- and \u0394DUB-HCMV infection indicates that HCMV-pUL48 DUB activity interferes with the induction of apoptosis and may thus induce oncogenic properties. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that the ability of anti-cancer drug etoposide to promote apoptosis, was reduced by WT-HCMV infection but not by \u0394DUB-HCMV infection (Figure 3d).",

Moreover, overexpression of UL48N, increased the cell migration (Figure 3f) and tissue invasion (Figure 3g) of IMR32 cells (tested by wound-healing and matrigel invasion assay, respectively), whereas UL48N\u0394DUB did not induce any of these characteristics of cancer. These data suggest that HCMV-DUB could promote several oncogenic properties and possibly initiate or promote cancer.",

HFFs deficient in either myd88 or sting were mocked or infected with WT-HCMV for analysis of I-IFN synthesis. WT-HCMV induced the synthesis of IFN\u03b2 in control HFFs whereas reduced the synthesis in mydd88 or sting knocked down HFFs (Figures 4c and d). This observation suggests that in absence of either MyD88 or STING, induction of I-IFN synthesis is compromised during HCMV infection, which further confirms a dependency on MyD88 and STING for I-IFN synthesis, during HCMV infection. To understand the role of HCMV-DUB (UL48N) in I-IFN synthesis, genes for MyD88 or STING were paired with UL48N and co-expressed in HEK293 cells together with the luciferase reporter gene regulated either by the IFN\u03b14, IFN\u03b16 or IFN\u03b2 promoter. All I-IFN promoters increased luciferase production when co-expressed with either the MyD88 or STING gene, however, in all cases the increase was inhibited upon co-expression of UL48N. (Figures 4e\u2013g and Supplementary Figure S2c). UL48N overexpression also inhibited CpG (TLR9-Ligand)-stimulated transcription of I-IFN and IP10 in HeLa cells (Figures 4h and i). Furthermore, we tested the efficacy of HCMV-DUB in affecting the I-IFN-dependent anti-viral immunity by transfecting IMR32 cells with UL48N or UL48N\u0394DUB constructs, followed by infecting the cells with New Castle Disease Virus (NDV), 24 h post transfection (hpt). Testing for NDV-replication by quantitative (q)-PCR, showed marked increase in NDV-replication in cells transfected with UL48N but not with UL48N\u0394DUB (Figure 4j). This finding suggests that UL48N suppressed cellular anti-viral responses, which was further proved by analyzing the replication status of both WT and \u0394DUB-HCMV in HFFs wherein replication of WT-HCMV was gradually increased with time compared with \u0394DUB-HCMV (Supplementary Figure S2d).",

An MTT assay, done 3 days after rIFN\u03b2 treatment, showed antagonization of rIFN\u03b2-mediated cell death by WT-HCMV-infected HFFs (Figure 4k). To further analyze I-IFN-antagonizing ability of UL48N for oncogenesis, IMR32 cells were transfected with different amounts of plasmid encoding UL48N or UL48N\u0394DUB and wound was created 24 hpt. Cell monolayer with wounds were treated with rIFN\u03b2 and observed after 72 h for wound healing. The UL48N-transfected IMR32 cells showed dose-dependent wound-healing compared with cells transfected with UL48N\u0394DUB or Vec, and cells treated with rIFN\u03b2 only (Figure 4l). Amount of FLAG-tagged UL48N and UL48N\u0394DUB was measured by immunoblotting (Figure 4l). Finally, to investigate a correlation of I-IFN inhibition with induction of oncogenic properties, receptor for I-IFNs (IFNAR) on HFFs was blocked using anti-IFNAR2 antibody to ultimately inhibit positive feedback signaling. Following blockade of IFNAR, HFFs were infected with WT- or \u0394DUB-HCMV and 3 dpi, transcript status of IFN\u03b2 was analyzed that showed an inhibition upon IFNAR blockade (Figure 4m). The cell proliferation and viability status were analyzed with same cells by doing MKi67 transcript quantification and MTT assay, respectively. Cells treated with anti-IFNAR2 antibody showed enhanced proliferation (Figure 4n) and viability (Figure 4o) compared with antibody-untreated cells that inversely correlated with IFN\u03b2 expression in same cells (Figures 4m and o). This suggests that induction of oncogenic properties upon WT-HCMV infection is owing to inhibition of I-IFNs. In addition, to understand the reason behind enhanced G2-phase entry of WT-HCMV-infected cells, cyclin-D1 transcript level was measured in HCMV-infected HFFs after 2 dpi, as I-IFN inhibits cyclin-D1 expression to block cell cycle at G1-phase.36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 Interestingly, cyclin-D1 (ccnd1) expression was upregulated upon WT-HCMV infection compared with mock or \u0394DUB-HCMV infection to HFFs (Supplementary Figure S2e), which inversely correlated with the I-IFN results observed in Figures 4a and b. These data collectively suggest that HCMV-DUB could inhibit I-IFN synthesis and I-IFN-mediated death of infected cells and thus promote oncogenic properties.",

To test this, NLS-mutant of UL48N was created as described previously46 and named as UL48N\u0394NLS (Figure 5a), which was unable to enter the nucleus (Figure 5b) and was equally efficient DUB as UL48N (Figure 5c). To analyze the function of UL48N (cytoplasmic or nuclear function) in I-IFN synthesis pathways, I-IFN promoter activity was measured with overexpression of UL48N and UL48N\u0394NLS. To this end, IFN\u03b14 and IFN\u03b2 promoter was activated by co-expression of MyD88 or STING, which are the key molecules of TLR9 or CDS signaling pathways, respectively. UL48N and UL48N\u0394NLS, both inhibited MyD88 or STING-mediated IFN\u03b14 or IFN\u03b2 promoter activity, respectively (Figures 5d and e). We hypothesized that UL48N deubiquitinates the cytoplasmic (not the nuclear) signaling molecules activated by PRRs, whose ubiquitination is necessary for induction of I-IFNs. We also compared UL48N\u0394NLS with UL48N in a wound-healing assay and found that wounds of IMR32-monolayers expressing either of the constructs, closed with equal efficiency after 48 h, (Figure 5f), despite a modest difference in I-IFN inhibiting property. This indicates that NLS of pUL48 is dispensable for the HCMV-DUB induced cell migration observed above (e.g., Figure 3f). These results show that nuclear localization of UL48N is not required to show inhibitory effect on I-IFN synthesis and cellular migratory activities.",

As K63 ubiquitination of cytoplasmic molecules is an important event during innate immune signaling, our next approach was to find out the cytoplasmic target molecule whose deubiquitination is facilitated by UL48N and is necessary for inhibition of I-IFN synthesis. To this end, various signaling molecules of the TLR and CDS pathways, undergoing K63 ubiquitination for induction of I-IFNs synthesis, were co-expressed with UL48N or UL48N\u0394DUB in HEK293 cells and were tested for IFN\u03b2 promoter activity by the Luciferase assay. Co-expression of UL48N with TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 or STING, inhibited IFN\u03b2 promoter activity whereas UL48N\u0394DUB completely rescued the inhibition in case of TRAF3 and IRAK1, and partially rescued in case of TRAF6, IRF7 and STING (Figure 6b). We concluded that UL48N is able to deubiquitinate multiple signaling molecules to inhibit I-IFN production. Finally, the K63-deubiquitination activity of UL48N was tested by immunoblot analysis using various constructs such as myc-tagged TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 or STING and FLAG-tagged UL48N and UL48N\u0394DUB as indicated in Figure 6c. The result showed that UL48N hugely deubiquitinates TRAF6, TRAF3 and STING (Figure 6d) and slightly deubiquitinates IRAK1 (Supplementary Figure S3a) and IRF7 (Supplementary Figure S3b). Collectively, these results suggest that HCMV-DUB targets various key molecules of the signaling cascade to suppress I-IFN and to induce oncogenesis.",

Studies showed indirect roles of HCMV immediate-early proteins (IE1 and IE2) in oncogenesis,47, 48, 49 however, lacked the information on underlying molecular mechanism in oncogenesis. Our study suggests that as a consequence of overcoming anti-viral innate immune response, HCMV infection and enzymatic activity of the HCMV-DUB, in particular, may initiate early steps in oncogenesis (Figure 7). This conclusion is based on the findings stemming from HCMV-infected cells and extended to transfection experiments done with the HCMV-DUB and specific cellular anti-viral response molecules. We showed that WT-HCMV infection to non-transformed HFFs, increased cell metabolic activity, cell proliferation, promoted rapid entry into G2-phase of cell cycle, resistance to apoptotic stimuli, enhanced anti-apoptotic gene expression (bcl2, birc3, prkce, survivin, xiap), and reduced expression of several pro-apoptotic gene (fadd, caspase-8, p21, tnf\u03b1) compared with \u0394DUB-HCMV infection. The expression level of several other anti-apoptotic genes (ciap1, cflip, bcl-xl, mcl-1 and hif1\u03b1) was either reduced in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs or was comparable to \u0394DUB-HCMV infection. Similarly, we observed that expression level of several other pro-apoptotic genes (bad and bax, bak, noxa, puma) was either reduced or remained unchanged due to infection with both, WT- and \u0394DUB-HCMV in HFFs. These observations suggest that differential expression-pattern of anti- or pro-apoptotic genes might be associated with stimuli, stimuli-duration or/and cell type. In addition, it may be possible that in other cell type various other anti- or pro-apoptotic genes might also be involved in the cell survival signaling upon HCMV infection. Collectively, we observed majority of anti- and pro-apoptotic genes are affected due to HCMV infection in HFFs to protect cells from apoptosis as well as to bring about oncogenesis via overall promoting cell survival and carcinogenic properties.",

We have also shown that UL48-DUB inhibits I-IFN synthesis induced through different PRRs-mediated signaling pathways wherein UL48-DUB deubiquitnates signaling mediators such as TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 and STING. Interestingly, in case of TRAF6, IRF7 and STING-mediated induction of I-IFN, N\u0394DUB-UL48 showed a partial repression, which also suggests a DUB-independent role of UL48N in oncogenesis. As HCMV inhibits I-IFN to counteract host innate immunity,54, 55 inhibition of I-IFN synthesis by HCMV indicates its potential to establish a pro-cancer microenvironment. In addition, studies suggest that people having a particular SNP in TLR9 (2848GA) are more susceptible to HCMV infection and cancer development.29, 56 Here, we have found evidence for hypothetical dual role for HCMV-DUB, in defeating host anti-viral responses and also promoting an oncogenic state.",

Collectively, our study suggests that HCMV could be a factor leading to development of cancer through UL48-DUB in immunocompromised or immune-declined aged individuals and HCMV-DUB could be a potential therapeutic target to manage HCMV-associated cancers.",
