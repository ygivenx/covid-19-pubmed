EBOV infection causes dysregulation of these antigen-presenting cells, increasing production and release of pro-inflammatory proteins, vasoactive molecules, and coagulation factors [5\u20137]. Pro-inflammatory molecules recruit other target cells to the site of infection, providing additional cells for virus infection and increasing circulation of inflammatory cells and proteins. This uncontrolled amplification of infection and cytokine production results in dysregulation of the inflammatory response, leading to the systemic spread of the virus, excessive cytokine accumulation and circulatory collapse observed in cases of fatal EBOV hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates [3, 4, 6, 8]. Contributing to this amplifying dysregulation, EBOV sustains replication in macrophages and DCs by counteracting early innate immune responses, thereby decreasing effective host responses to the virus [5, 9]. These events in combination with decreased T cell numbers observed in EBOV-infected individuals [10] are thought to lead to poor adaptive immune responses to infection.",

One approach to controlling virus replication in macrophages is to elicit early innate immune responses. If these responses could be triggered prior to virus-mediated inhibition of these responses, systemic control of EBOV replication should be possible. Previous studies have investigated the ability of type I interferons (IFNs) to decrease EBOV morbidity and mortality with mixed results [11\u201313]. Jahrling et al. demonstrated that administration of IFN-alpha2b by itself did not significantly alter the course of EBOV in cynomolgus macaques, but more recently IFN-\u03b2 was shown to prolong survival in rhesus macaques [11, 12]. Additionally, the combination of type I IFN with three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against EBOV glycoprotein (GP) provided robust protection against lethal challenge, while neither the IFN nor mAbs alone was highly efficacious [13].",

Macrophages treated with IFN\u03b3 alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) are activated towards a M1 phenotype that is characteristically proinflammatory and antiviral, enhancing host defenses [14\u201316]. As IFN\u03b3 directly stimulates the expression of a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) having antiviral activity [17, 18], IFN\u03b3 treatment would be predicted to generate macrophages that are resistant to EBOV infection. Since it is thought that EBOV infection of macrophages is responsible for dysregulated cytokine production, reducing infection would likely reduce aberrant cytokine production concomitantly. Finally, as IFN\u03b3 potently activates T cell responses through enhancement of phagocytosis and antigen presentation [19], such stimulation of antigen presentation would be predicted to enhance adaptive immune responses to in vivo infection.",

We also identified novel IFN\u03b3-stimulated genes that inhibit EBOV infection, defining new downstream mechanisms through which this FDA-approved drug functions. During these studies, we evaluated IFN\u03b3 inhibition of a BSL2 model virus of EBOV, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV), in interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knock out (IFNAR-/-) mice. IFN\u03b3 was highly effective at inhibiting infection by this recombinant virus. Comparative use of this recombinant BSL2 virus in parallel with EBOV and wild-type VSV permitted us to evaluate the mechanism of IFN\u03b3 inhibition in greater detail. These latter findings suggest that IFN\u03b3 may have efficacy not only against EBOV, but also a broader range of Mononegavirales.",

M-CSF-treated cells were consistently more permissive for EBOV infection than GM-CSF-treated cells. Consequently, M-CSF-treated macrophages were primarily investigated in these studies. We observed that M-CSF-treated peritoneal macrophages cultures that were also pretreated with a combination of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 were highly resistant to EBOV infection (Fig 1A). The addition of cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 to macrophages has been shown to generate a proinflammatory M1 phenotype [14, 15]. Evidence that the combination of these cytokines or IFN\u03b3 alone elicited an M1 phenotype of our isolated macrophages included significant increases in expression of proinflammatory genes such as IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and CXCL10 in our cells in the presence or absence of EBOV infection (S1 Fig).",

Therefore, to narrow down which step(s) within the life cycle is affected by IFN\u03b3, we compared the ability of IFN\u03b3 and CHX to inhibit viral RNA production and determined if the combination of these two drugs inhibited viral RNA levels to a greater extent. BALB/c IFNAR-/- peritoneal macrophages were treated with M-CSF in the presence or absence of IFN\u03b3 for 24 hours. At the initiation of EBOV infection under BSL4 conditions, CHX was added and viral RNA levels were assessed at 6 and 14 hours of infection. CHX or IFN\u03b3 suppressed EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase (L) RNA levels equally and the combination of inhibitors did not further reduce EBOV RNA production (Fig 2B). Similar results were observed with EBOV GP/rVSV infections harvested at 6 hours (S4 Fig). In total, these findings indicate that IFN\u03b3 treatment interferes with RNA synthesis that is dependent upon protein synthesis and suggests that virus replication is blocked.",

To determine the impact of IFN\u03b3 stimulation on gene expression in our macrophage cultures, we performed microarray analyses. We identified 268 genes with at least two-fold increased or decreased expression in IFN\u03b3-treated six-day-M-CSF-matured hMDM (Fig 3A and S1 Table).

Forty-one of the significantly altered genes were identified in both arrays (Fig 3B and S6A Fig).

IRF1 siRNA or scrambled control siRNA was delivered to peritoneal macrophages by exosomes since direct siRNA transfection of macrophages is highly inefficient. To validate this siRNA delivery method, we initially demonstrated that exosomes are efficiently engulfed by murine peritoneal macrophages (S7 Fig). In the context of EBOV GP/rVSV infection, delivery of IRF1 siRNA containing exosomes knocked down IRF1 mRNA levels by approximately 50% in both M-CSF- and M-CSF/IFN\u03b3-treated macrophages (Fig 4D). With IRF1 knock down, a significant increase in EBOV GP/rVSV RNA was observed 24 hours following infection, consistent with the importance of IRF1 expression in controlling virus infection by IFN\u03b3.",

For these studies, BALB/c IFNAR-/- mice were used as little to no pathogenesis is observed with EBOV GP/rVSV infections of wild-type mice, but significant morbidity and mortality occurs in IFNAR-/- mice. Initial IFN\u03b3 dose response studies demonstrated that both 3.3 and 10 \u03bcg of IFN\u03b3 protected IFNAR-/- mice against lethal EBOV GP/rVSV challenge (S8A Fig). Further, neither dose of IFN\u03b3 had any detectable consequence on the weight or health of the mice. Therefore, subsequent studies were performed with both dosages. IFN\u03b3 administered by i.p. injection 24 hours prior to, 2 or 6 hours after a lethal dose of EBOV GP/rVSV protected mice against challenge, with treated mice demonstrating significantly reduced mortality, weight loss and clinical sickness scores compared to untreated, virus-infected animals (Figs 5A and S8B\u2013S8D). At the 10 \u03bcg IFN\u03b3 dose, we also assessed survival of mice when IFN\u03b3 was given at 12 and 48 hours after challenge. While only 75% of the mice survived challenge in the 12-hour post challenge group, the protection offered by this treatment was not statistically different than that conferred at time points more proximal to the challenge (Fig 5A).

As a consequence, in these studies we used 102 infectious units of VSV as our challenge virus, the lowest concentration of VSV that resulted in predictable death. IFNAR-/- mice challenged with VSV were given 3.3 \u03bcg of IFN\u03b3 either 24 hours prior or 2 hours after challenge. While the 24-hour pre-treated mice had significant protection, 40% mortality was still observed. Surprisingly, the survival of the 2-hour IFN\u03b3 post-treatment mice was not significantly different from the PBS-treated, VSV infected mice (S8B Fig). This finding stands in contrast to the robust protection IFN\u03b3 conferred at 2, 6 and 12 hours following EBOV GP/rVSV challenge.

Since antiviral efficacy required the presence of IFN\u03b3 receptor, but not the type I receptor, IFN\u03b3 control of EBOV infection occurs independently of type I IFN responses. Thus, we sought to identify specific IFN\u03b3-stimulated genes involved in its antiviral effect. In addition to previously characterized ISGs, we identified three novel IFN\u03b3-stimulated factors, GBP5, RARRES3 and VAMP5. To date, GBP5, RARRES3 or VAMP5 has not been shown to control negative strand RNA virus infection. Finally, we demonstrated that the recombinant BSL2-level virus, EBOV GP/rVSV, recapitulates our findings with EBOV, arguing that studies with this BSL2 model virus may serve as a safer and cost effective alternative for initial evaluations of novel anti-filoviral agents.",

However, the timing of IFN\u03b3 protection against wild-type EBOV and wild-type VSV differed. IFN\u03b3 treatment protected against VSV only when given prior to infection, whereas post-challenge treatment appeared somewhat more efficacious against EBOV than pre-challenge treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that some ISGs are solely synthesized during the first few hours following IFN stimulation, whereas others are expressed for longer periods of time [50]. The difference in timing of IFN\u03b3 protection against VSV versus EBOV suggests that ISGs responsible for protection may differ. Future studies are needed to explore this possibility. Since mice challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV were protected by IFN\u03b3 treatment at post challenge time points in a manner similar to EBOV, the difference in timing of protection may be related to the cell populations targeted by the two wild-type viruses.",

Studies with type I IFNs have shown that a subset of ISGs preferentially target negative strand RNA viruses [51] and this may be the case with IFN\u03b3-stimulated ISGs as well. Not surprisingly, expression of IFN\u03b3-activated transcription factor IRF1 inhibited EBOV infection and this ISG served as a positive control in these experiments [18, 40, 52]. Other downstream ISGs were selected for study based on the enhancement of their expression elicited by IFN\u03b3 in our gene array studies and availability of expression constructs. The ability of GBP5, RARRES3 and VAMP5 to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses has been poorly studied and the mechanisms driving inhibition of virus replication remain to be elucidated. Each of these ISGs reduced EBOV infection; however, as has been shown with other viruses, combinations of ISGs are likely to provide additive or even synergistic inhibition if the ISGs are targeting independent modulatory pathways [40].",
