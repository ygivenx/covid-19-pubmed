The criteria for inclusion in the SARSID were radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, fever \u226538\u00b0C or history of such at any time in the past 2 days, and at least two of the following: a) history of chills in the past 2 days; b) cough (new or increased cough) or breathing difficulty; c) general malaise or myalgia; and d) known history of exposure. However, patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain their illness. Moreover, each case classified as confirmed SARS was verified by the Hong Kong Department of Health according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on case definitions (WHO 2003). Eighty-two percent of the 1,755 cases listed as confirmed SARS had either reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction results positive for SARS-CoV or a 4-fold increase in IgG antibodies in paired sera (at admission and 21 or 28 days after symptom onset). Two questionnaires (case questionnaire and case-contact survey) were administered, mostly through telephone interviews, to all SARS cases confirmed by the Department of Health, initially by four regional field offices and later by a central interviewing team of nurses, to record symptoms at presentation to the hospital and to identify contacts and events of probable significance to transmission.",

Point by point is the simplest form of mapping disease occurrences without accounting for the magnitude at each location, but the sheer number and spread of points could have impeded effective reading of the event. A map of cumulative counts collapses the numerous observations into circles of varying sizes to signify differences in the magnitude of disease occurrences in the community. The circles are proportionally sized to reflect the number of occurrences at the sites, and geographic clustering of disease infection can then be clearly identified.",

The R scale assumes that events will be randomly spaced unless something influences the distribution. Three different patterns are possible: clustered (0 \u2264R < 0.8), distributed randomly (0.8 \u2264R < 1.8), or with uniform spacing (1.8 \u2264R \u22642.149).

A 5-day incubation period, consistent with a previous gamma distribution parameter estimation exercise (Leung et al., in press), was used to restructure the data for a time-series study. A statistical surface was created by the kernel method (Bailey and Gatrell 1995) for each day to reveal daily changes of disease hot spots. A kernel size of 300 \u00d7 300 m2 was used to reconstruct the territory of Hong Kong into a gridded surface of 208 columns and 151 rows. The kernel size was 300 \u00d7 300 m2, and disease occurrences within a bandwidth of 600 m from the kernel were summarized to yield density measures in terms of number of SARS cases per square meter. Each grid was then designated either as urban or suburban based upon land use classification, and its associated density measure was adjusted for the underlying variation in population density (i.e., kernel density \u00d7 population density \u00d7 grid cell size/1,000) to yield infection rates per 1,000 population. We adopted the approach by Kafadar (1996) but modified it to account for variation between urban or suburban population densities within a given district in Hong Kong (Table 1). Each urban or suburban grid was considered a homogeneous unit wherein its population density was apportioned according to the proportion of residents in the employed labor force.",

The infection rates, which span across a wide range, were collapsed into 15 classes to reduce the complexity of map representation. Each of the 15 classes was assigned a shade in proportion to the magnitudes, with darker shades representing higher densities of infection. Two kinds of indexes were employed to assess the extent of disease clustering: R scale and Moran\u2019s I coefficient for more highly connected grids of the queen\u2019s case that considers a neighborhood of eight cells in a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix. Moran\u2019s I coefficient ranges between \u22121 and 1 and is interpreted as regionalized or juxtaposition of similar values (0.6 \u2264I \u22641 indicating positive spatial autocorrelation), lack of autocorrelation, or the actual arrangement of values as one that we would expect from a random distribution (\u22120.6 < I < 0.6 indicating no spatial correlation), and either contrasting or tendency for dissimilar values to cluster (\u22121 \u2264I \u2264\u22120.6 indicating negative spatial correlation). Although R scale is a global measure for the spread or dispersion of disease incidence for point data based on nearest neighbor distance (Eck and Weisburd 1995; Krebs 1989; Taylor 1977), Moran\u2019s coefficient measures local spatial autocorrelation for area data (Getis and Ord 1992; Sawada 2001).

Lines were drawn to connect an origin location where the flow started (e.g., index source of infection) with related destinations where the flow ended (e.g., residences of secondary contacts). The OD plots are an established methodology employed by transport professionals and human geographers to examine the extent of spatial interaction and human settlement, as well as the modeling of commodity flows (Batten and Boyce 1986). The flow data themselves can be people, goods, telecommunications, and so on. The lines help to delimit the spatial coverage revealing the extent or degree of spread. SD ellipses centered on the geometric mean of all locations were drawn to provide a summary trend of the dispersion and to examine whether a distribution has a directional bias.

Each kernel map shows the density of SARS patients adjusted for underlying population density (i.e., SARS infection rate per 1,000 population) on a prototypical day over 16 weeks, with darker zones emphasizing disease hot spots [see also daily animated series by Lai and Chan (2004)]. A few disease hot spots were shown to be developing in the Kowloon peninsula and southeast New Territories (i.e., Ma On Shan and Shatin) by 10 March, which was followed later by a heavy concentration at the AMOY by 28 March. By early April, the AMOY case load began to dissipate and a new hot spot emerged in Tai Po (northeast New Territories). There is clear evidence of varying degrees of clustering as the epidemic progressed over time based on the low R values. The low R values signify substantial degrees of clustering (significant at 99% confidence level), with higher degrees of clustering occurring around the peak of the infection and relatively small divergences from random distribution at the beginning of the outbreak. High Moran\u2019s I coefficients of \u22650.6 indicate that similar values tend to cluster together, which confirms the geospatial clustering and thus infectious nature of the disease, based on rates that were adjusted for the underlying population density. Figure 3 summarizes SARS hot spots in Hong Kong considering cumulative disease occurrences from February through June 2003. The map shows that the urban population was at higher risk of contracting SARS (Moran\u2019s I = 0.78, p < 0.001), having already accounted for variation in population density.",

Figure 5 is a logarithmic plot of the mean and SD of the infection rates of the 12 prototypical days representing different stages of the epidemic; values for individual days are presented in Table 3. Pairwise comparisons between each of the prototypical days and day 1 (or the day of indifference) of the epidemic demonstrated no detectable difference between the mean infection rates throughout the epidemic. However, there were statistically significant differences, by the F-test at a 0.01 significance level, in the SDs of the middle 10 prototypical days compared to day 1, suggesting unequal population variances during much of the outbreak. Higher F-values indicate more unequal variance. Given that the SD is a measure of geographic dispersion, we can infer that a larger SD signifies a wider spread of the disease over the territory. The crossover points of the mean and SD curves in Figure 5 indicate, on the one end, the beginning of substantial disease spread across the territory, and on the other end, the subsidence of the epidemic. Therefore, the time from day 1 (18 February) through day 16 (6 March) was the prodrome of the epidemic, whereas days 86 (15 May) through 106 (4 June) marked the declining phase of the outbreak.",

The SD ellipses of the PWH cluster (Figure 6D) reveal a northwest\u2013southeast directional trend of disease spread that extends over most of Hong Kong. The AMOY cluster was comparatively more localized, and the map had to be be enlarged to show the standard ellipses that exhibit an almost east\u2013west directional trend of disease transmission (Figure 6B).

When applied in real time during the onset and evolution of an epidemic, it can monitor and enhance understanding of the transmission dynamics of an infectious agent, thereby facilitating the design, implementation, and evaluation of potential intervention strategies. GIS can offer quantitative and statistical measures along with visualization tools to examine patterns of disease spread with respect to disease clusters. Disease mapping is a first step toward understanding spatial aspects of health-related problems, as particular kinds of information are highlighted in maps. Various cartographic symbolizations (as points, lines, or areal patterns) can show the distribution of diseases. Disease clusters and other associations can then be deduced statistically and visually after examining the disease maps.

In fact, such geospatial intelligence gathered from examining statistical surfaces and disease clusters provided the basis for the formulation of our transmission dynamics model (Riley et al. 2003). More specifically, choice of a suitable framework was not straightforward in constructing the transmission dynamics model where a variety of approaches were possible, ranging from a simple deterministic compartmental approach to a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation. Given the data available for Hong Kong, we based our analyses on a stochastic metapopulation compartmental model.

The daily animated series of kernel maps clearly shows that SARS was a highly localized disease; thus, its route of transmission was unlikely to be through casual contact, as it is for influenza and measles, but more compatible with close contact via heavy respiratory droplets and fomites. This confirms that SARS is only a moderately transmissible condition with a basic reproduction number of about 3 (Riley et al. 2003), in contrast to measles and influenza, which have basic reproduction numbers of about 13 and 5, respectively (Anderson and May 1991; Ferguson et al. 2003). An alternative interpretation of the observed high degree of geospatial clustering would be that SARS was due to an environmental point source outbreak. Indeed, faulty sewage systems and the \u201cchimney effect\u201d is the leading hypothesis explaining the AMOY SSE (especially block E), although some have suggested roof rats as a vector (Ng 2004). Although it is difficult to gauge retrospectively, had the GIS system we implemented in this report been available for near real-time analysis, it would likely have detected the highly unusual clustering of cases in SSEs such as the PWH and AMOY outbreaks much sooner, as they evolved. This in turn could have resulted in more rapid contact tracing and public health intervention, thus perhaps mitigating the extent of spread substantially in the case of person-to-person transmission events and preventing further large-scale environmental point source outbreaks in residential apartment blocks (although it would not have made a difference to AMOY itself given the temporally abrupt and short-lived environmental release of viral particles).",

Data consistency and, in particular, the nonstandardization of patient address formats is one such example. Field epidemiologists often relegate certain personal particulars such as residential and work addresses to a lower priority in their data collection procedures, or at least enter the information in a haphazard fashion, rendering GIS analysis very difficult by diminishing the proportion of usable cases for analyses. Similar generic problems that plague the establishment of all information systems must be resolved to enable real-time disease monitoring and surveillance. They include lack of standardization for data capture documents, procedures and protocols for information management, delays in transferring and updating information, and a lack of rapid analysis and audit of databases. The SARS epidemic is a clear signal that Hong Kong needs much greater and sustained investment in health informatics, that is, public health information systems, the skills to use them, and networks to share them.",
