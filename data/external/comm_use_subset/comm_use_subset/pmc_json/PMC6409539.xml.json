Both live and killed vaccines are administered to poultry, and live vaccines are commonly used for a variety of pathogens because they are effective when mass applied and are relatively economical [1]. In general, live vaccines induce local and cell-mediated immunity and provide a broader protective response than killed vaccines, whereas killed vaccines primarily induce humoral immunity and tend to be antigen-specific. The duration of immunity achieved following live vaccine administration depends on the age and type of bird, levels of maternal immunity, disease targeted by the vaccine, immunogenicity of the vaccine, method of vaccine application, number of and interval between boosters, virulence and similarity of the field challenge virus, interval between vaccination and challenge, and immunocompetency of the host [1,2,3].",

The virus initially replicates in the upper respiratory tract, followed by systemic replication in the reproductive tract and some strains can cause lesions in the kidney [4]. Infected birds may exhibit nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, and tracheal rales [4]. The disease is prevented by vaccination, and live vaccines are commonly used to induce local immunity and protection. Live vaccines are generally administered to young birds to achieve early protection, and layers and breeders are also boosted with either live or inactivated vaccines, which vary based on their similarity to the circulating field viruses [2].",

Depending on the strain of the virus, clinical signs of ND infection may be absent or may involve depression, inappetence, respiratory signs (nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing), reduced egg production and egg quality, and neurological signs (torticollis, circling, paralysis) [3]. Strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are characterized as lentogenic, mesogenic, and velogenic, according to their mean death time in embryos [6]. Lentogenic strains are of low pathogenicity causing mild respiratory or enteric infections, followed by mesogenic strains, while velogenic isolates are highly pathogenic often causing neurological signs and mortality [3]. Vaccination regimes against NDV vary and may utilize a combination of live, inactivated, and virus-vectored vaccines [7]. In the United States, the most widely used traditional vaccine strains comprise lentogenic B1 (or virus clones of the B1 strain) and LaSota strains [3].",

Sample vaccination regimes in different poultry sectors are reviewed in the Merck Veterinary Manual (www.merckvetmanual.com), in which the interval between vaccinations is often only a matter of weeks. However, there is little information showing that the intervals between vaccinations are sufficient for the birds to develop adequate immune protection against challenge for each virus. The literature shows that sequential viral infections may result in viral interference, in which one virus blocks the subsequent infection and/or replication of another virus in the host [9,10], but until now it is unknown whether this phenomenon results in reduced protection from serially administered attenuated live vaccines in chickens. Interestingly, it has been reported that simultaneous administration of viruses to chickens or turkeys does not result in viral interference [11]. In this study, we investigate how a typical commercial vaccination schedule consisting of a combination of serially administered, live attenuated viral respiratory disease vaccines affects the development and longevity of immunity and protection against homologous challenge.",

The vaccine was diluted according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The challenge virus used was IBV GA98/CWL0474/98 and was prepared at a median embryo infectious dose (EID50) of 103.19. Virus titers were calculated by the Reed and Muench method [12]. A commercial NDV vaccine B1 (NEWHATCH-C2, Merck Animal Health, Summit, NJ, USA) was used for both vaccination and challenge and was reconstituted following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Since mesogenic and velogenic strains of NDV require a biosafety level above BSL2, which is not available in our laboratory, our experimental model for protection against NDV involves significantly reduced virus titers or sterile immunity against a second exposure (challenge) with the vaccine virus. An ILTV commercial CEO vaccine (Trachivax\u00ae Merck Animal Health, Summit, NJ, USA) and pathogenic ILTV Georgia broiler strain 63140 [13] were used for vaccination and challenge, respectively. Strain 63140 was propagated in chicken kidney cells obtained from 3- to 4-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens [14]. The CEO vaccine was prepared following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. After inoculation, the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was confirmed by titration of both viruses in chicken kidney cells as previously described [14].",

Chicks were placed on fresh pine shavings in colony houses and pens. Chicks were vaccinated with the manufacturers recommended dose in 100 \u00b5L via the oculonasal route according to the following schedule; IBV at 1 DOA, NDV at 2 weeks of age (WOA), IBV at 4 WOA, ILTV at 8 WOA, NDV at 12 WOA, and ILTV at 16 WOA. In addition, a control group was not vaccinated. Homologous challenges were conducted at 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 WOA, and necropsies were performed five days post-challenge (dpc). At challenge, birds received one of four treatments: IBV GA98, NDV B1, ILTV 63140, or no challenge. The treatment groups for each challenge virus per time point were as follows: non-vaccinated, non-challenged (n = 9\u201310); vaccinated, non-challenged (n = 9\u201310); vaccinated, challenged (n = 17\u201319); non-vaccinated, challenged (n = 9\u201310). All IBV-challenged birds received an EID50 of 1 \u00d7 103.2 per bird in 100 \u00b5L intranasally. All NDV-challenged birds received the NDV B1 vaccine in 100 \u00b5L intranasally, reconstituted according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All ILTV-challenged birds received the 63140 pathogenic strain at a dose of 1 \u00d7 103.5 TCID50 per bird in 100 \u00b5L split equally between eyedrop and intranasal routes. For IBV and NDV challenges, birds were observed at 5 dpc for respiratory signs, as previously described [15]: 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe. For ILTV challenges, birds were observed at 3 and 5 dpc for dyspnea, conjunctivitis, depression, and mortality, as described previously [16]. The choanal cleft (IBV- and NDV-challenged and control birds at 5 dpc) or trachea (ILTV-challenged and control birds at 3 and 5 dpc) was swabbed for virus detection, and swabs were stored in PBS at \u221280 \u00b0C. At 28, 32, and 36 WOA, 50 \u00b5L of tears was collected by adding granulated NaCl to the eye. Blood was collected by wing or cardiac puncture and added to a microcentrifuge tube to collect serum for antibody detection. Birds were humanely euthanized, and the eyelid, Harderian gland (HG), thymus, liver, spleen, cecal tonsils, and bursa of Fabricius were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for virus detection and in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The trachea was removed, and one section was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and the remaining portion of the trachea was submerged in tissue culture media for the ciliostasis test described below. The procedures were approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP #: A2015 05-001-R2).",

With the knowledge that live vaccine viruses can persist in flocks, it has been unclear, until now whether the immunity induced by a live vaccines could be compromised because of viral interference, a phenomenon in which one replicating virus blocks the infection and/or replication of another virus [9,10]. Although the vaccines in the present study were administered at intervals of 2 or 4 weeks, it is feasible that virus from a previous immunization was still present at the time of the subsequent vaccination. IBV vaccines have been detected in the respiratory tract up to 28 days post-vaccination [27], and IBV was isolated from tracheal and cloacal swabs collected at the point of lay and 19 weeks of age in hens that had been virus-negative for several weeks following recovery from inoculation at one day of age [4]. Fentie, et al. [28] reported that chickens vaccinated with NDV B1 shed vaccine virus 14 days post-inoculation. In addition, a study by Hughes, et al. [29] demonstrated intermittent shedding in the trachea from ILTV-immunized chickens between 7 and 14 weeks post-vaccination. ",

In a subsequent study [11], the same group found that low pathogenic avian influenza virus given 3 days after a lentogenic strain of NDV did show viral interference whereas viral interference was not observed when the viruses were given simultaneously. We did not measure vaccine virus replication in the present study and, therefore, could not determine whether one vaccine virus compromised the infection and replication of a subsequent vaccine virus. However, our goal was to determine if chickens sequentially vaccinated with all three viruses were protected from viral replication and clinical signs following homologous challenge. Thus, regardless of viral interference, our data shows that immunity to individual vaccine viruses was not compromised following sequential administration of multiple live attenuated vaccines targeting different viral respiratory tract pathogens.",

Since we used a lentogenic strain of NDV as challenge virus in our experimental design, protection was primarily based on significantly reduced or no virus detection at 5 days after challenge, which is a measure of local immunity preventing virus infection and/or replication. Presumably a bird protected from infection with a lentogenic strain of NDV would also show some level of protection from exposure to mesogenic or velogenic strains. Vaccinated birds at each sampling time had significantly lower or no challenge virus RNA compared to positive control groups, indicating that the vaccinated birds developed a local immune response and were indeed protected whereas the non-vaccinated positive controls were not. Because lentogenic NDV only causes a mild respiratory or enteric infection [3], it was not surprising that respiratory signs and histological changes were mild or absent despite the presence of viral RNA. We observed clinical signs of NDV infection only at 20 WOA in positive controls, while only a few birds showed mild clinical signs at 24 and 28 WOA, and no clinical signs of disease were observed at later challenge times. This observation is consistent with existing knowledge that ND tends to be more severe in younger birds [39].",

In addition, the proximity of the conjunctiva to the inoculation site (eyedrop and intranasal) might explain why the local immune response was not able to completely block viral replication in the conjunctiva but successfully cleared the virus before it could replicate in HG and trachea.",

In addition, Gerganov and Surtmadzhiev [45] also demonstrated ciliostasis in ILTV-infected tracheal organ cultures at 7\u20138 days post-infection. Therefore, our results combined with previous studies indicate that measuring ciliostasis may not be a reliable marker of protection from ILTV infection and that ciliostasis in ILTV infection studies may need to be evaluated at later times post-inoculation.",
