Each QIAstat RP cartridge contains a full process Internal Control (IC), which is a MS2 bacteriophage that is included in dried format and gets automatically rehydrated upon sample loading. The IC verifies all steps of the analysis process during testing, including sample resuspension/homogenization, lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, and PCR. The cartridge has two distinct loading ports and can be inoculated directly with a dry swab or with transport medium. In brief, samples were homogenized by vigorous inversion of the vial and 300 \u03bcL UTM was transferred into the assay cartridge using the provided transfer pipette. The inoculated cartridge was placed on the instrument. The test started automatically and ran for 69 minutes. Upon completing the test and ejecting the cartridge, the analyzer interpreted results and displayed a test summary. The analyzer will also report errors that may occur during processing. Amplification curves and cycle threshold (Ct) values can be viewed for detected pathogens and for the IC. A report can be printed or exported to an external USB storage device.

The test cartridge ID and patient/sample ID is entered by on-board scanner and the total assay time is approximately 69 minutes. The QIAstat Dx DiagCORE analyzer offers a small footprint, traceable internal inhibition controls (by amplification curve as well as Ct value), low maintenance requirements and low failure rate as well as seamless connectivity and integration with hospital and laboratory information systems. In addition, the QIAstat Dx DiagCORE analyzer offers access to amplification curves and Ct values of all detected pathogen targets. The QIAstat RP assay cartridge has on-board wet and dry reagents, build-in amplification inhibition controls, detects 21 pathogens in a total of 8 separate reaction chambers, offers a direct dry swab testing option via a separate cartridge input port and stores at room temperature. The QIAstat RP is CE IVD marked and FDA approval is pending.",

            "text": "The syndromic diagnostic approach for ARTI may provide multiple benefits for the institution (e.g. prudent use of side room isolation facilities, reduced prescription of antimicrobials, targeted use of antivirals) The benefits have been partly described in previous publications. Trabattoni et al reported a significant reduction in Emergency Department (ED) length of stay as well as a significant reduction in hospitalization rate for patients tested by the Alere i influenza assay in the ED [22], and Hansen et al reported a positive impact on admittance rate as well as total cost by Roche Liat influenza testing in the ED setting [14]. Brendish et al reported on encouraging findings of PoC testing of respiratory viruses, as their studies showed that this testing was associated with a reduced length of hospital stay, resulted in more single doses or brief courses of antibiotics as well as in an improved influenza detection and antiviral use [15]. However, understanding of the full impact on patient management by the syndromic testing approach for ARTI as well as the cost-benefit will require more prospective outcome studies. Such studies would also provide information regarding which patient population(s) will benefit the most from respiratory tract syndromic testing and what the added benefits of syndromic testing compared to selected target testing (e.g. influenza A/B virus, human orthopneumovirus, hMPV, Bordetella pertussis or combinations hereof).",
