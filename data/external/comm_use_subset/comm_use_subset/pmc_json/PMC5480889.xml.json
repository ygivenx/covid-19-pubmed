            "text": "Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a viral hemorrhagic disease that prior to 2013 was implicated in sporadic outbreaks in Equatorial Africa; the 2013\u201316 outbreak spread outside of Western Africa, and greatly heightened the lay press coverage of the disease. At the time, EVD treatment options were strictly supportive, leaving health officials with contact tracing, isolation, and behavior modification approaches to curtailing the outbreak [1]. The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model for media reporting on public health emergencies was established in 2005 [2] and has subsequently been used to analyze media reporting on outbreaks of influenza [3, 4], measles [5], second hand smoke hazards [6], and medication adherence [7]. However, analysis has not been applied to the Western African outbreak of EVD despite the notable volume of media coverage and contemporaneous political debate. The need for accurate reporting and advising is paramount when attempting to tackle outbreaks through behavior change. However, today\u2019s media environment carries the reputation of one more interested in speed to publication than accuracy of information\u2013leading to the general public reporting a general lack of trust in the media [8] and creating the potential for the dissemination of dangerous misinformation. Completeness and accuracy are difficult to define in the fast moving world of scientific knowledge; sources viewed as correct reflections of a complete story one day may be viewed as half-truths the next. However, while it is beyond the scope of this project to attempt to provide the definitive story of EVD, it is possible to contrast the consensus information of the time with the contemporaneous reporting. This study aimed to provide novel insights into the completeness and accuracy of media reporting by applying the established CERC coding model to the 2013\u20132016 EVD outbreak across various levels of the written media\u2013academic journals, news magazines, newspapers, Wikipedia, blogs, and alternative media outlets.",

Based on their abstract, coded academic articles were limited to review articles that aimed to provide an overview of the entire topic (such as \u201cA primer on Ebola for clinicians\u201d [9]) as compared to those reviewing a specific sub-topic (\u201cTransmission dynamics and control of Ebola virus disease (EVD): a review\u201d [10]; Fig 1). This search was repeated for articles dated from 2010-December 2013 to compare those written just prior to the 2013 outbreak.

The top magazines, newspapers, and online blogs (as determined by subscription/traffic by The Alliance for Audited Media [110]) were searched using the same parameters as for the academic press. Top sources were: magazines (AARP magazine, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, National Geographic, Time); newspapers (LA Times, Washington Post, New York Post, New York Times, USA Today, and Wall Street Journal); blogs (CBS, ABC/Yahoo!, NBC, CNN, Huffington Post). Newspapers and magazines were indexed from LexisNexis Academic at Himmelfarb Library at the George Washington University Milken School of Public Health. Only one New York Post article was scored since the remaining were behind a prohibitive pay-wall. Blog sites may have differing algorithms for their internal searches, all blog posts were thus collected by using the Google function of \u201csite:blog name.com ebola[title]\u201d. Alternative sites (InfoWars, VeteransToday, Beforeitsnews, NewsBusters, and NoDisinfo) were selected after having been identified as the top five sites of social influence by recent media assessments [111]. Top pages from blogs and alternative sites were selected based on Google\u2019s relevance assessment. Lay press search yielded 38 magazine, 219 newspaper, and 29,850 blog posts. Time and resources precluded scoring of all blog posts and thus, only the top 30 for each group were read. After eliminating duplicates (for example when ABC/Yahoo! carried a Huffington Post article) a total of 133 were scored as a representative sample (S1 Appendix). Wikipedia articles were collected by downloading the EVD page on the same date that blog and newspaper searchers were performed. Prior versions were accessed within the Wikipedia site and the page status immediately prior to the December 2013 outbreak was taken as a pre-outbreak comparator. Potential covariates were documented such as date of publication, copy length, author\u2019s nation of origin, total pages, impact factor, readership, number of authors, and citations.",

Inter-reader variation was calculated by taking the total number of topics and subtopics scored for agreement (110, plus additional error scores if more than one error of each type was found), subtracting the number of discordant topic points (topics that primary reader gave credit but the secondary reader did not or vice versa), then dividing by the total possible points.

Overt errors were statements that were simply untrue, such as claims that the outbreak began in March of 2014 instead of December 2013 [86] (which would not have been erroneous if stated in the early stages of the outbreak, but this information was established by the time of the article\u2019s publication). Caveated inaccuracies were those presenting inaccurate statements as uncertainty (such as \u201cAirborne spread is rare or absent\u201d [14] when only \u201cabsent\u201d is correct) or to place an unnecessary qualifier in front of accurate statements that has the potential to cast doubt (such as \u201cfrom what we know of the science, Ebola is not an airborne disease\u201d)(Huffington Post 11)). Such qualifiers placed in front of discussion of airborne transmission, but not in front of any other statement could suggest doubt (for example, no article stated \u2018from what we know, EVD is a viral disease\u2019).

The nations most impacted were Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, but disease also spread to Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali. Unlike prior outbreaks, EVD affected nations outside of the African continent: the US, UK, Italy, Germany, and Spain all had citizens either infected or treated on their soil.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Department of Transportation were in charge of assuring safe transport and testing of patients, blood samples, and contaminated supplies within the US. When the death toll in Liberia threatened to enter exponential growth, President Obama called for military aide through the Department of Defense to bolster the diagnostic support being provided by USAMRIID (US Army Medical Research Institute in Infectious Disease); the Defense Department built an EVD treatment unit (ETU) in Liberia while members of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the uniformed service under the Surgeon General and the Department of Health and Human Services staffed this ETU.

While EVD is one of the hemorrhagic fevers (along with disease caused by Marburg virus and others), in contrast to pop-culture imagery less than half [117] of the patients stricken with EVD manifest bleeding complications. Bleeding is a negative prognostic indicator and, when present, indicates late stage disease. Therefore its absence should not deter from the diagnosis, especially when the patient may be early in the disease course. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also common and include abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Additional potential symptoms include headache, muscle and joint aches, sore throat, confusion, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and occasionally a maculopapular rash. Hiccups are an established symptom; while not universal, they may help to distinguish EVD and Marburg infection [118] from those disorders with similar presentations such as malaria and Dengue.",

Ebola virus is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC) like macrophages and dendritic cells, which then migrate to the lymph nodes where they would normally help amplify the normal immune response. However in EVD, the APC die and spread the virus into the lymphatic system and eventually the spleen. As immune cells become infected, they release inflammatory proteins called cytokines, which attract other immune cells to the infected area that are then also infected. This process amplifies upon itself, cells become infected, die, produce cytokines, bringing in more cells, which become infected, die, etc. This creates an uncontrolled cascade of inflammation known as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d which can damage the patient\u2019s own tissues and organs. Furthermore, as Ebola virus kills immune cells, the body is left susceptible to other forms of infection. In fatal cases, infection and tissue damage cause death through shock and multisystem organ failure.",

Rather standard public health measures were able to curtail the outbreak such as rapid identification and isolation of confirmed cases followed by tracing all their contacts and daily monitoring and/or quarantining them for the recommended 21-days. While the CDC and WHO supported screening travelers for fever departing from Western African nations and upon final arrival, a blanket travel ban was not advised. Travel bans have been counter-productive in past pandemics, as they blocked needed resources from entering and leaving afflicted nations. While recommendations for handling samples in a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility was not fully achievable in the Western African environment, strict and frequent decontamination of sample processing and patient care areas with bleach containing solutions was widely practiced.",

Some confusion may have arisen given that \u201cdroplet spread\u201d can occur by sneezing, which does transmit \u2018through air\u2019. However, airborne spread is defined by far greater distances of spread and often a far greater infectivity as measured by an R0 (R-naught) number. The R0 for EVD (1.9\u20134.1) is much closer to other fluid-borne diseases like HIV (4) than airborne disease like measles (>18). Effectively, if you are not within close proximity (approximately two meters, or six feet) [119] of a person who has had active signs of EVD, you do not have to fear catching the disease. This rule was somewhat shaken when it was discovered that female sexual partners of male EVD survivors could contract the disease due to viral persistence in semen for several months. Confusing word choice may be to blame for some of the misconceptions surrounding when a person is contagious. Some outlets stated that you could not contract EVD from a person unless they were symptomatic. This was communicated to assure the public of the fact that travelers that passed fever screenings upon entering the US would not be contagious to any of their fellow passengers. A better phrasing may be that a person is not contagious until they manifest symptoms; this phrasing would capture the potential for survivors to spread the virus via semen after active symptoms had resolved. However, these semantics would not impact the consensus that patients manifesting symptoms of EVD are routinely too sick to perform activities of daily living like shopping, driving, or riding public transportation.",

Many in the Western African regions, especially during the early portion of the outbreak, refused to alert officials to potential EVD cases in their families. Years of mistrust in government and foreigners led to initial conflict between the population and the care providing institutions. Additional population risk factors that made Western Africa susceptible for an EVD outbreak included densely populated cities, porous borders, and the profound poverty and under resourced health care systems of the region. A few sources postulated that food insecurity due to climate-change is also theorized to have spurred the outbreak as it increased the need for reliance on the consumption of \u2018bush meat\u2019 that could have come from infected animals [26, 68]. These authors also implicated deforestation as a possible contributor to the outbreak by increasing the interaction of humans with the newly displaced animal population, particularly bats, which are presumed to be the animal vectors for EVD [26, 68].

Authors of the pre-outbreak general review articles were either from the United States (two articles), Tanzania, or Gabon. Post-outbreak saw a great geographic expansion to include Canada, India, Uganda, the United Kingdom, China, France, Gambia, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Turkey, Poland, and the United States.",

Review articles were far more likely to discuss elements needed for treatment and containment after the outbreak. For example, mentioning of contact tracing and isolation, detailing the recommended PPE, and the treatment recommendations were all more likely to appear after 2013. It is worth noting that the treatment and containment topics did not contain new information; this information garnered increased focus but did not differ from pre-2013 manuscripts as to reflect \u2018lessons learned\u2019 during the outbreak. Topics that did appear de novo after 2013 included the increased risk of spontaneous abortion for pregnant females and the established finding that hiccups may be a manifestation of EVD, which was overlooked by the review articles selected. The hiccup finding is not a trivial one; it was reported that MSF received early reports of patients with viral syndromes accompanied by hiccups [17]. While this is not a pathognomonic finding, a clustering of suspicious deaths, which included the presence of hiccups alerted MSF officials that the outbreak potentially represented a serious outbreak of hemorrhagic fever. This was the basis for their early appeals to the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide a rapid response to the first EVD outbreak in a densely populated area [17].",

The purpose of this study was to assess the potential for Ebola virus to be employed as a weapon of biologic warfare. The findings indicate that EVD could be spread by an intentional release within an area of poor ventilation such as a subway car or plane. However, these findings do not indicate that EVD is \u2018airborne\u2019 under natural conditions.

However, Ebola virions can survive on surfaces for several days to weeks and thus spread is theoretically possible [125]. However, evaluation of clinical environments showed that no viable Ebola virus could be found on any surfaces that were not visually contaminated with blood [126], indicating that EVD transmission through routine daily exposures does not occur. Evidence against natural airborne spread is even more extensive. There have been no cases of EVD suspected of aerosolized transmission. Individuals cohabitating with EVD patients, even in tight quarters, do not contract the disease without contacting blood or body fluid [1, 18, 23, 45, 78, 83, 92]. Furthermore, the R0 (R-naught) number for EVD is markedly below that of influenza or other diseases known to have an aerosolized potential for spread [1]. Therefore, the only correct way to discuss airborne spread for EVD is to definitively state that such spread does not occur under natural conditions. Statements of airborne transmission within a context of biological warfare were not present in the literature reviewed, but would not have been scored as erroneous. Statements made within a context of a human outbreak that suggest airborne spread \u2018cannot be excluded\u2019 or \u2018may be possible\u2019 are not consistent with the factual conclusions from the totality of the literature.",

However, Wikipedia revealed one of the top scores with 77.6% after the outbreak and scored a 56.2% before the outbreak. The academic journals were typically over 8 pages while lay press articles were often less than two. Therefore, adjusted for page length there was only slightly and non-significantly higher for academic press (7% of total topics covered per page) compared to Wikipedia (5.5%), magazines (4.7%), newspapers (6.8%), blogs (6.9%), and alternative sites (4.3%). The lower score for magazines was, in part, due to greater presence of large pictures. As a somewhat unexpected finding however was that academic journals carried a higher error rate than magazines, newspapers, and blogs, but not alternative media (Fig 3B). Although there was one academic paper with 30 different erroneous statements [68], if this outlier were excluded the difference with alternative media would become significant but it would not change the significance for other lay press sources. Of note, errors in newspaper writings were associated with anonymous authorship and being a letter to the editor or editorial.",

For example, rather than debate the academic nuances of a recent publication on heart disease, a newspaper may focus on communicating which, if any, life style modifications a reader should make when the new study is viewed in the context of the established review article recommendations. To some extent our findings support a potential synergistic dynamic of academia and the lay press. Had our results supported our initial hypothesis and indicated that comprehensive review articles could serve as a collective source of accurate information, the subsequent recommendations would have been to encourage lay press authors to access these journals for background understanding.

As another example, a debate over the potential for EVD to be contracted from a bowling ball may never be settled in academia. Even with a dedicated study looking at bowling balls as EVD fomites, no researcher could test for all possible variables such as ambient temperature, porousness of the bowling ball, length on contact, skin integrity of the bowler, starting inoculum, etc. Communications to the public should stress that any actionable policy trying to curtail airborne EVD would waste resources and that no one should cancel their bowling plans.

No pathogen in the history of known biology has even mutated to change its mechanism of transmission [136, 137]; therefore there are more publications supporting the position that the universe is a hologram [138\u2013140] than blood borne viruses spontaneously becoming airborne transmittable. Such modeling would be difficult, but could include the average viral load of EVD patients (roughly 10 million) [141] multiplied by the total documented cases in history (31,079) [142] to get an estimate of the total interactions between an Ebola virion and the human host. This may support the estimate that historically, roughly 300 billion virion-host interactions have occurred without any reported airborne transmission. It is not our intention to proffer this 1 in 300 billion estimate as the definitive pre-test odds calculation, and any post-test assertions would have to account for viral turnover, predictions of undocumented cases, animal carriage, and other factors. While a more Bayesian approach [143, 144] would itself generate debate within the scientific community, a reporter attempting to make a last minute deadline would find more than just the terms \u201cpossible\u201d or \u201ccannot be excluded\u201d as stand ins for every probability between impossible and almost certain.

At minimum, academicians must be mindful of the context within which they present scientific uncertainty. Data related to aerosolization of Ebola virus within a context of bio-warfare preparation present a different risk of misinterpretation when the context of the discussion shifts to that of outbreak response; efforts must therefore be made to present the actionable implications of the data within the new context. This clear communication is especially vital during the height of an epidemic when state-enforced measures can worsen local social insecurity [120] whilst the truly \u201cviral\u201d spread of public attention creates a susceptibility to a fear contagion [149].",

This could indicate that public health officials and academicians may find a willing partner in some written press sources; those from which most Americans get their news appear to aide in fostering an accurate understanding of serious medical topics. These finding may also represent a potentially useful addition to news sourcing algorithms, such as those used by Facebook [150], to preference media outlets with objective track records of accuracy and completeness. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between new and old media for the most popular news outlets. It would be intriguing to hypothesize if popularity of these sources is a reflection of their apparent dedication to accuracy that begets selective advantage in the marketplace, or if their built-brands afford them enough cover to avoid stereotypical \u2018click-bait\u2019 or sordid sensationalism.",

Of the 27 errors made in the newspaper media, 19 (70%) were within the categories of letters or editorials. Furthermore, the quality of the errors within the letters and editorials were also far more misleading. While the standard news pieces mostly erred in not specifically stating that bleeding is not a universal symptom of EVD, the letters and editorials misled by stating travel bans would be a net benefit, airborne spread is an actionable concern, and patients were contagious before being symptomatic (S2 Table). While the alternative media articles used more apocalyptic verbiage, the basic themes of their errors did not differ from newspaper op-ed and letters. While it is understandable that newspapers would want to solicit input from a diverse sampling of sources, perhaps they should hold these authors the same standard of factuality that they hold their staff writers to, or consider editor annotation to point out misinformed or misleading statements.",

It was not feasible with the resources at hand to collect all media coverage, including television and less popular magazines, newspapers, and blogs. Even within the media outlets selected, many of the lay press outlets do not have an objective means of collecting all relevant publication; as such, only a sampling of lay press articles could be included in this analysis. However, the ease of accessibility of the media included did not predict the content or accuracy; newspaper articles covered in the New York Times did not differ significantly from the completely accessible Wall Street Journal except that the later contained editorials that carried an increased risk of erroneous statements. Furthermore, this study\u2019s use of objective mechanisms of collecting the lay press sources excluded some that are specialized for scientific information (such as Science News or Scientific American). An interesting follow up study could be to assess if these science-focused outlets were equal or superior to the outlets collected in this investigation. While this would not be conclusive, it does suggest that the large sample examined, while incomplete, was reflective of the whole. An additional major limitation is the inability to combine both qualitative and quantitate analysis in an objective manner. The binary scoring of the CERC system meant that articles that simply mentioned \u201ccommunity outreach\u201d were given an equal score as those that detailed the types and benefits of such practices. It could be valuable to perform subsequent analysis re-scoring papers based on depth of each major topic, if this could be done in an objective fashion.",

It is unknown if any reporters, politicians, or pundits made inaccurate statements due directly to the lack of clarity in the academic reviews. However, this work may still achieve its goal of comparing the contemporaneous academic reviews available to reporters and policy makers at the time of their background research.

While this study in no suggests that the lay press was superior to academic works, the crux of our conclusions is that modern media access to academia makes it far more likely that a given academic author will be misunderstood. Writing within academia affords the ability to focus on novel findings and forego discussion of background knowledge that the author can safely assume the reader possesses. However, seclusion from the populace also carries a disadvantage of needing to rely upon the lay press to translate one\u2019s findings into that which is fit for consumption in the public sphere. Given the erosion of the barriers siloing an academia increasingly pressured to produce publications, combined with the demands of today\u2019s fast-paced media environment, contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the traditional paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions.",
