In fact, only 26 cases were reported in the US from 1975 to 2005 [3]. Around 2010, epidemics of EV-D68 coincident with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) were reported worldwide [4]. EV-D68 was also detected in patients with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)/acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in the US, Norway, and France from 2012 to 2014 [5\u20139].",

In addition, 310 respiratory specimens were collected from hospitals and clinics from April to December 2015 for cooperative research. Surveillance in Osaka City was part of a national surveillance program for viral infectious diseases in Japan based on the Infectious Diseases Control Law. Specimens, collected as part of a passive surveillance, were residues after clinical use in hospitals and clinics. Specimens were anonymized before testing in our public health laboratory. Sample collection, detection of pathogens, and analysis of detected pathogens were approved by domestic law without additional permissions. Specifically, informed consent is considered unnecessary by domestic law and according to ethical guidelines for epidemiological research. However, sample collection for the cooperative research, which was not considered virus surveillance, required both informed consent and ethics committee review. Therefore, written consent was obtained from parents and guardians of the children whose specimens were included in the study. This part of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan (no. 532).",

Earlier reports describing receptor binding activity of EV-D68 strains in all genetic clades showed that distinct genetic clades have different antigenicities [28]. Therefore, differences in the prevalent genetic clade of EV-D68 each year in Osaka City might have contributed to its re-emergence in this limited geographic area. There were high similarities in VP1 nucleotide and amino acid sequences of Osaka strains detected in 2010, 2013, and 2015. However, lower similarities were observed for strains detected in 2010 vs. 2013, 2013 vs. 2015, and 2010 vs. 2015. This low similarity might be associated with differences in EV-D68 antigenicity. Lower herd immunity against strains in specific genetic clades of EV-D68 might have facilitated the rapid spread of a clade of EV-D68 that was not reported to be prevalent in the limited geographic area. Intriguingly, co-circulation of all three clades of EV-D68 was observed in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, in the 2010 epidemic [12]. Based on these results, EV-D68 dynamics might differ in the same period in different parts of the country. One might infer that herd immunity against different clades of EV-D68 is associated with their prevalences in a limited geographic area.",

Some characteristic partial deletions, relative to the prototype Fermon strain, were observed in the 5\u2032 UTRs of EV-D68 strains in three clades. However, we did not analyze functional differences or the physiological importance of the deletion on EV-D68. To date, there has been no published report on the function of the EV-D68 5\u2032 UTR. The 5\u2032 UTR of an enterovirus contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that is associated with translational efficiency and virulence [29\u201331]. Deletions in EV-D68 strains appeared to be in the region between the IRES and the open reading frame. Analysis of this deletion may yield important information about EV-D68. The 5\u2032 UTR of EV-D68 strain CA/AFP/11-1767 in clade B showed a deletion similar to that of strains in Clade A. Du et al. analyzed 2014 North American EV-D68 outbreak using VP1, which revealed that CA/AFP/11-1767 strain was phylogenetically distant from other subclade B1 strains [32]. Their findings might partially explain one amino acid substitution (T650) in the BC loop of VP1 in strain CA/AFP/11-1767. However, the reason for the Clade A-like nucleotide deletion in the 5\u2032UTR of strain CA/AFP/11-1767 remains unknown.",

To analyze EV-D68 further, near-complete genome sequences of earlier reported strains from cases of ARI, AFM, encephalitis, central nervous system disorders, and other diseases must be determined. Recently, a novel genetic lineage of Subclade B3 was identified that now includes 2015 Osaka strains. Based on our phylogenetic analysis of VP1 (Fig 2), there are some strains (2013-0720-6-CHN, 2011-21186-CHN, CA/AFP/v12T00346-USA-2013, CU171-THA-2011, CU134-THA-2011) that do not clearly cluster in the currently recognized genetic subgroups in Clade B.
