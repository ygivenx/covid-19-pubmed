            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly virulent coronavirus that causes severe enteric disease in pigs (1). PEDV infection manifests itself as watery diarrhea and vomiting and leads to dangerous dehydration that is often fatal, particularly in neonatal piglets (2, 3). PEDV was first isolated in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, where it was initially believed to be a new strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (4). PEDV outbreaks since 2010 in China, the United States, and Canada are estimated to have caused over $1 billion in agricultural damage, which has led to renewed interest in the development of antiviral therapeutics (5, 6). Reports of protection against PEDV reinfection and passive transfer of lactogenic immunity to suckling piglets suggest that vaccination would be an effective means of preventing future outbreaks, although there is currently no such approved vaccine in the United States or Europe (7). Recent efforts in Asia have produced both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, but their efficacies have yet to be thoroughly evaluated (8).",

            "text": "PEDV is an alphacoronavirus with a 28-kbp positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome that contains at least seven open reading frames (ORF) (9). ORF 2 encodes the fusion glycoprotein spike (PEDV S), which acts as both the major determinant of host cell tropism and the mediator of viral entry into host cells (10). PEDV S is a homotrimeric class I fusion protein that is processed into S1 and S2 subunits by trypsin-like host cell proteases (11). For most coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit attaches to cellular carbohydrates and the C-terminal domain of S1 (S1-CTD) binds to a cellular protein receptor (12\u201316). Carbohydrate binding by the S1 N-terminal domain is thought to keep the virus in close proximity to the host cell surface, whereas engagement of specific protein receptors by the S1-CTD is thought to initiate a series of conformational changes in the spike that ultimately result in membrane fusion and delivery of the viral genome to the cytosol. The S2 subunit mediates the membrane fusion event and exhibits the characteristics that define class I fusion proteins. These include a hydrophobic fusion peptide that is directly C terminal to a protease cleavage site, as well as a series of \u03b1-helices in the prefusion conformation that rearrange to form a thermostable, elongated six-helix bundle in the postfusion conformation (17, 18).",

PEDV S D\u2205 has been shown to preferentially bind to sialic acid, which is thought to heavily influence the host cell tropism of PEDV. This interaction has been characterized through both high-throughput glycan arrays and hemagglutination assays (20, 21). Although a precise, quantitative analysis of the affinity of this interaction has yet to be reported, it is generally thought to be a relatively low-affinity interaction that is facilitated by the avidity effect of having numerous copies of trimeric spikes present on the viral surface (22). Despite the importance of this carbohydrate-binding interaction in facilitating cellular attachment, the isolation of D\u2205-deletion variants in vivo and in vitro suggests that sialic acid binding is not strictly required for cell entry (23, 24). However, inoculation with D\u2205-deletion variants results in attenuated disease compared to strains that contain D\u2205 (25).",

It has been suggested that PEDV makes use of porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as a receptor; however, pAPN-knockout swine testis cells are still susceptible to PEDV infection, and this putative interaction has yet to be recapitulated with purified, recombinant components (12, 29). Regardless of the identity of its functional receptor, PEDV has been shown to infect and replicate in porcine, simian, and human cells, indicating that the virus likely makes use of receptors that share a high degree of homology among these species (21).",

In one of these conformations, the S1-CTDs pack tightly against the S2 subunit, making the receptor-binding motifs inaccessible to host cell receptors and neutralizing antibodies. In the alternative conformation, the S1-CTD hinges away from the spike, such that it no longer associates with S2 and the receptor-binding motifs are no longer occluded (30\u201332). It has been proposed that sequential receptor binding events trap this transient, receptor-accessible conformation and gradually destabilize S, leading to dissociation of S1, refolding of S2, and membrane fusion (32, 33). However, in the only alphacoronavirus S structure reported to date, no such S1-CTD dynamics were reported and all three S1-CTDs were in a compact, receptor-inaccessible conformation (34). Although it is possible that the alphacoronaviruses make use of a triggering mechanism different from that used by the closely related betacoronaviruses, it seems more likely that this transient conformation simply has yet to be observed.",

The structure revealed a D\u2205 conformation that was distinct from that observed in the previously determined NL63 S structure. Additionally, particles of dissociated S1 rings with S1-CTDs in two different conformations were also observed, suggesting that alphacoronavirus spike-mediated fusion is initiated similarly to what has been proposed for betacoronaviruses.",

This construct was designed to be truncated just after heptad repeat 2 (HR2) such that the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), transmembrane domain (TM), and intravirion tail (IV) were excluded. To these residues we appended a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, an 8\u00d7 His tag, and a Twin-Strep-tag. Affinity purification from a 500-ml transfection volume yielded approximately 0.5 mg of protein, which was then further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SDS-PAGE revealed a single band between 160 and 220 kDa, corresponding to the molecular weight of a glycosylated monomer that showed no evidence of cleavage by endogenous proteases. The SEC chromatogram revealed a single, symmetrical peak with an elution volume corresponding to a molecular weight of roughly 600 kDa, suggesting a heavily glycosylated homotrimer. The purified protein was then used to prepare cryo-EM grids. Initially, CF-1.2/1.3 grids were used, but the PEDV S proteins were occluded from the thin ice and exhibited a tendency to cluster around the edge of the holes rather than being uniformly embedded throughout the vitreous ice layer. To mitigate these effects, CF-2/2 grids were prepared using optimized blotting conditions, which allowed collection of full fields of view that contained PEDV S proteins throughout.",

The 269,838 Warp-extracted particles were then imported into cryoSPARC v2 for further processing (36). Two-dimensional (2D) classification removed 122,440 \u201cjunk\u201d particles, and the remaining 147,398 particles were used to generate three ab initio volumes without imposition of any symmetry restraints. These three volumes were then used as templates to sort all 147,398 particles by 3D classification. This more stringent classification method sorted 34,743 particles into two classes which did not resemble biological macromolecules. The remaining 112,655 particles were sorted into a third class in which secondary structural elements were clearly visible. This final set of 112,655 particles was used to perform nonuniform homogeneous 3D refinement. These data were initially processed without imposing symmetry, resulting in a 3.3-\u00c5 map with obvious C3 symmetry. After C3 symmetry was imposed, the resolution improved to 3.1 \u00c5 (Fig. 1; see also Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). This map was then sharpened using LocalDeBlur before being used for model building and refinement (37).",

Similarly, the density began to fade after Tyr1242 and the flexible HR2 domain at the C terminus of S could not be resolved.

We observed density for and built corresponding glycan molecules at 18 of the 21 sites. For the majority of these sites, we built only a single N-acetylglucosamine, whereas larger glycan chains could be built at 5 sites (Fig. S4D). The PEDV S1 subunit is almost entirely composed of \u03b2-sheets, whereas the S2 subunit is made up of a series of discontinuous \u03b1-helices that are characteristic of a class I fusion protein in the prefusion conformation (Fig. S3A).",

The NTD is densely glycosylated, with seven N-linked glycosylation sites, all of which could be resolved and six of which contained corresponding glycan density. The density at Asn261 was particularly prominent and allowed us to build a branched, high-mannose glycan that was packed between the NTD and the \u03b1-helices of the S2 fusion machinery.

Although a majority of the S1-CTD is organized into \u03b2-sheets, these secondary structural elements are thought to function as a scaffold for key aromatic residues based on the interactions between closely related alphacoronaviruses and their respective host cell receptors (15, 27). These aromatic residues are packed tightly against the NTD of the same protomer in the prefusion conformation, suggesting that the S1-CTD must undergo a conformational rearrangement in order to productively engage a host cell receptor. Subdomain 1 (SD-1) and subdomain 2 (SD-2) (Gln472 to Ser503 and Val638 to Tyr761, respectively) are composed of 14 \u03b2-strands and 5 N-linked glycosylation sites, 4 of which had observable glycan density. The putative S1/S2 cleavage site, between Lys755 and Ser756, is located in a small loop between the final two \u03b2-strands of SD-2 (Fig. S4A and B) (11). This cleavage site is positioned at the side of PEDV S, roughly equidistant between the viral membrane and the apex of the spike. Although this site is readily accessible to host trypsin-like proteases and can be cleaved by the addition of exogenous trypsin, our reconstruction showed continuous density for the peptide backbone throughout this region, supporting our SDS-PAGE data that indicated that the spike used in these studies had not been proteolytically processed at the S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig. 2). These data are also consistent with previous reports that PEDV S remains uncleaved during viral packaging and becomes proteolytically activated upon exposure to lysosomal proteases in the host cell (39).",

One such strain, PEDV PC177, was recently used to inoculate piglets in a PEDV challenge model, and it was shown that not only was the primary infection with PEDV PC177 significantly attenuated compared to infection with PEDV CV777, but also the piglets inoculated with the D\u2205-deletion variant were significantly more susceptible to subsequent reinfection with PEDV CV777 than those that were originally inoculated with PEDV CV777 (25). In an attempt to discover a structural explanation for these observations, we expressed and purified residues 1 to 1125 of PEDV PC177 S using the same C-terminal T4 fibritin motif and affinity tags that were used to express and purify PEDV CV777 S. Excluding the D\u2205 deletion at the N terminus of the spike, this variant shares 100% sequence identity with PEDV CV777 S. Because of this deletion, we were able to detect a slight but measurable shift of the PEDV PC177 S SEC elution volume relative to the elution volume of PEDV CV777 S (Fig. 5A). The purified PEDV PC177 S was then observed by negative-stain EM (Fig. 5B). The final 3D reconstruction of this S variant has a resolution of \u223c20 \u00c5, which was sufficient to show that, other than the absence of D\u2205, the structure of PC177 S does not dramatically differ from that of CV777 S (Fig. 5C). Because the previously reported differences in susceptibility to reinfection cannot be ascribed to any large-scale conformational differences between the spikes, these data suggest that the enhanced protection against reinfection in piglets inoculated with PEDV CV777 is due to a porcine immune response against D\u2205.",

Although these loops are present at the apex of the trimer (Fig. 6, top panel; see also Fig. S5), it is unlikely that they would be able to engage a host cell protein receptor without the receptor sterically clashing with both the NTD of the same protomer and the S1-CTD of the neighboring protomer (Fig. 6, bottom panel). For the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, this clash is avoided when the S1-CTDs undergo a hinge-like movement that repositions the domains above the rest of S1 (31, 32). This conformational change is thought to allow the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to mask their determinants of receptor binding from antibodies in one conformation while making them readily accessible for host cell receptor engagement in another conformation. However, after extensive 3D classification of our PEDV CV777 data set, we were unable to observe any such conformational dynamism of the PEDV S1-CTDs in the intact PEDV S trimer. Despite this, the inaccessibility of the putative receptor-binding loops in their observed conformation suggests that there is likely to be an equivalent phenomenon in the alphacoronaviruses.",

The presence of these dissociated rings suggests that some small proportion of the purified spike was processed by endogenous trypsin-like proteases, even though SDS-PAGE analysis revealed only a single band corresponding to uncleaved S (Fig. 2). Similar dissociated S1 rings have been reported during cryo-EM analysis of MERS-CoV S (31). Despite the relatively few dissociated PEDV S1 caps that were observed, a 3D reconstruction generated from these particles resulted in a 9.4-\u00c5 map that showed evidence of the conformational rearrangement for two of the three S1-CTDs (Fig. 7B and C). These domains appear to have rotated \u223c30\u00b0 away from the 3-fold axis of symmetry, presumably undergoing a hinge-like motion similar to what has been observed in the betacoronaviruses (Fig. 7D). The two S1-CTDs that are observed in the \u201cout\u201d conformation are stacked directly on their respective SD-1s such that their receptor-binding loops are now pointed away from the NTD and are presumably readily accessible to engage with a putative host cell receptor without forming any steric clashes. Although further experimentation will be required to obtain high-resolution structures of these transient conformations, these observations provide some of the first insights into the process of alphacoronavirus receptor engagement and triggering.",

Although poor connectivity and a relatively low level of local resolution in this region of our map prevented us from reliably assigning atomic coordinates to the entirety of D\u2205, the map clearly reveals that this domain is located at the apex of the trimer, \u223c40 \u00c5 away from the D\u2205 conformation in NL63 S. One possible explanation for this novel conformation is that we are merely resolving one of several alternative conformations that D\u2205 can sample. However, because we observed only a single, discrete conformation of D\u2205 in our data set, this explanation seems unlikely. It is also possible that this conformational discrepancy can be explained by the differences in the expression platforms that were used to produce the S proteins. Coronavirus S proteins are densely glycosylated, and differences in N-linked glycan addition and maturation in mammalian cells (used to produce PEDV S) and in insect cells (used to produce NL63 S) could lead to electrostatic differences or steric hindrances that may result in the conformational change. A third possibility is that D\u2205 of PEDV S genuinely adopts a stable, alternative conformation from that of the NL63 S D\u2205.",

Here, for the first time in alphacoronaviruses, we report similarly dissociated PEDV S1 rings among our intact S trimers. Yuan et al. (31) were able to generate a relatively low-resolution 3D reconstruction from their dissociated MERS-CoV S1 rings, which seemed to suggest that the MERS-CoV S1-CTD was flipped into the receptor-accessible \u201cout\u201d conformation. The 3D reconstruction generated from dissociated PEDV S1 trimers reveals a similar phenomenon, such that two of the S1-CTDs have rotated to a receptor-accessible \u201cout\u201d conformation. These data provide the first evidence for conformational dynamism of the S1-CTDs in alphacoronaviruses. It is currently not known why these distinct conformational states have not been observed for intact alphacoronavirus spikes, but it is possible that without a receptor or receptor mimic such as an S1-CTD-directed antibody to trap this receptor-binding domain (RBD)-accessible conformation, the transient exposure of the S1-CTD is a very rare event (33).
