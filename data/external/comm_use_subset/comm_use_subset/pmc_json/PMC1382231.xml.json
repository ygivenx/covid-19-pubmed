A factor that is important in the effective control of an epidemic involves the early identification and isolation of infected individuals [3]. We have previously reported the development of a diagnostic test based on the detection of the SARS-CoV RNA in serum/plasma by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [4,5]. Eighty percent of infected individuals were shown to be positive by the test on the first day of hospital admission with no false-positive results [4,5]. The serum SARS-CoV RNA concentration detected upon admission has also been shown to be predictive of the requirement for subsequent intensive care [4]. The approach has been demonstrated to be useful for serial monitoring of treatment efficacy [6].",

The main differences between the two kits lie in the starting sample volume and whether an external lysis protocol is available. The former kit processes 200 \u03bcL of serum and is compatible with the use of an external lysis protocol preinstalled in the accompanying software (MagNA Pure LC Software v.3.0, Roche Applied Science) of the MagNA Pure LC instrument. The latter kit, however, processes 1000 \u03bcL of serum and no external lysis protocol had been predefined. External lysis is a processing step whereby lysis buffer can be added to clinical specimens manually prior to the transfer of the sample and buffer mixture to the automated instrument for further downstream processing. External lysis is a desirable step for the processing of potentially infectious specimens whereby the specimens could be processed according to the recommended biosafety precautions until the pathogens are lysed and the specimen rendered safe for further processing by the MagNA Pure LC instrument.",

Therefore, we evaluated an in-house modification of the manufacturer's protocol for the \"large volume\" kit with the addition of an external lysis step. To minimise the infectious risk to the laboratory personnel, all analyses were performed using aliquots of a SARS-CoV culture isolate that had been inactivated by procedures previously described [8]. Inactivated SARS-CoV was spiked into transport medium so that the resultant mixture contained 108 copies/mL of the virus. Viral RNA was extracted from aliquots of this mixture in triplicate both according to the standard as well as modified protocols for the large volume kit. For the standard protocol, laboratory personnel were only involved with the initial transfer of 1000 \u03bcL of each specimen to individual sample cartridges placed inside the instrument after which proteinase K and buffers, including 450 \u03bcL of lysis buffer, were added by the instrument in a sequential and automated fashion. For the modified protocol, 310 \u03bcL of lysis buffer was first added to 690 \u03bcL of specimen in a biosafety cabinet to make up a final volume of 1000 \u03bcL. After vortexing, the mixture was transferred in ice to the sample cartridges on the MagNA Pure LC instrument. The instrument was then activated to run as per the standard protocol. The externally-added lysis buffer (310 \u03bcL) when mixed with the volume of lysis buffer pre-loaded on the MagNA Pure LC instrument (450 \u03bcL) amounts to a total of 860 \u03bcL of lysis buffer for 690 \u03bcL of specimen and thus contributes to a lysis buffer:sample ratio which largely resembles that adopted in the external lysis protocol of the total nucleic acid isolation kit. All viral RNA preparations extracted in this study were quantified using a real time quantitative one-step RT-PCR assay targeting the Nucleocapsid-gene of the SARS-CoV as previously described [4]. Briefly, the assay involves the use of the EZ rTth RNA PCR reagent set (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) on an Applied Biosystems 7700 Sequence Detector. 12 \u03bcL of extracted viral RNA was used for amplification in a reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL.",

Furthermore, when the sample contained 10 copies/mL SARS-CoV, the large volume kit yielded positive detection in four replicates, while viral RNA extractions from the total nucleic acid kit was only positive in one replicate. These data suggest that the modified protocol of the large volume kit has comparable performance with the total nucleic acid kit for the extraction of samples containing high SARS-CoV concentration, but enabled more sensitive detection when samples containing low levels of SARS-CoV were extracted. By aligning samples positive and negative for SARS-CoV in an alternating manner for extraction by the modified protocol of the large volume kit, there was no evidence of carry-over contamination. All the negative samples were indeed tested negative regardless of the magnitude of the SARS-CoV concentrations (ranging from 102 to 107 copies/mL) in the adjacent wells.

Results for this part of the study are summarized in Table 1. For serum SARS-CoV concentration at 103 copies/mL, the overall assay coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean \u00d7 100%) was 45.3% and 76.9% when RNA extractions from the manual and automated methods were quantified, respectively. For serum SARS-CoV concentration at 105 copies/mL, the assay coefficient of variation was 47.4% for the manual RNA extraction and 51.0% when automated RNA extraction was used.",

Reagent kits suitable for the extraction of viral RNA from serum and plasma as recommended by the instrument manufacturer were evaluated. As the extraction procedure should conform to the biosafety practices recommended by the World Health Organization [10], a modified protocol which incorporates an external lysis processing step for the MagNA Pure LC total nucleic acid large volume kit (Roche Diagnostics) was developed. The World Health Organization recommends that nucleic acid extraction procedures for SARS-CoV involving untreated specimens should first be performed under biosafety level 2 facilities with additional level 3 work practices [10]. After the viral particles had been lysed or inactivated, the specimens could be handled according to standard level 2 practices. We showed that the use of the large volume kit resulted in better analytical sensitivity when compared with the total nucleic acid kit as evident by the higher rates of positive detection among samples containing low concentrations of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the MagNA Pure LC system was shown to be free from problems of carry-over contamination.",

Viral RNA extracted from the automated method led to SARS-CoV concentrations that were consistently lower than that extracted by the manual method across a wide range of SARS-CoV concentrations in both transport medium and serum. Furthermore, better detection rates were observed for serum containing low concentrations of SARS-CoV when extracted by the manual method in comparison with the automated method. The manual method also contributed to better overall analytical precision as evident by the lower coefficients of variation.",

Albeit the convenience and potential improvement in throughput offered by an automated protocol, our evaluation revealed that the automated viral RNA extraction protocol is less sensitive, less precise and produced quantitative results that were consistently lower than those of the column-based manual extraction method. Though the reasons for the observed differences in kit performance is not known at present, we recommend the use of the column-based manual RNA extraction method as the diagnostic performance of the serum SARS-CoV RNA quantitative RT-PCR test [4,5] is critically associated with the analytical sensitivity contributed both by the RNA extraction and RT-PCR components of the test,. Furthermore, as it has been previously shown that the serum SARS-CoV concentration has prognostic implications [4] and serial assessment is useful for the monitoring of patient progress [5,6], the superior quantitative performance and precision of the column-based extraction method are additional features that favour its use over the automated protocol.",
