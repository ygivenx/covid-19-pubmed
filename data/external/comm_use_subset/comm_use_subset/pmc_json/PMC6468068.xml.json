MENA\u2010ISN works as a think tank to share evidence\u2010based information, experience and best practices in order to address challenges in control and prevention of influenza, and to increase partnership and networking between countries and international organizations. The main objectives of MENA\u2010ISN are the following:\nImprove awareness and knowledge of influenza burden through effective communication, education and training;Strengthen evidence base through surveillance and research;Reduce the incidence of infection through effective prevention measures;Increase influenza vaccine uptake and introduction into the national immunization programmes;Develop the economic case for sustainable investment of National Plans.\n",

Maternal immunization can reduce the risk of post\u2010natal infections in the infants.5 Currently, two studies among pregnant women are ongoing in Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. One aims at using antibodies in the umbilical cord of women who received vaccination during pregnancy as a marker of response to influenza virus vaccination in pregnant women. Two other studies on the critical window of vaccination during pregnancy and a prospective observational cohort study to determine the burden of influenza disease in pregnant women and in the newborns in the MENA region are under examination by the expert group.",

For example, frailty has been studied in influenza surveillance in Canada, where a frailty index based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment has been found to impact estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness and outcomes of hospitalization with influenza illness.9 Given that frailty can be measured in different ways, work is ongoing to identify and validate brief measures of frailty such as the Clinical Frailty Scale which may be more readily implemented in resource\u2010diverse settings.11\n",

            "text": "Currently, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is the main vaccine in use in the majority of MENA countries. Considering different vaccine products, which could be targeted to different high\u2010risk groups (eg young children, immunosuppressed or elderly people) in MENA region, has the potential to provide greater effectiveness that would also help in combating the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. Introduction of quadrivalent vaccine covering both influenza B lineages could be beneficial since both lineages have been detected in MENA countries. Given that elderly people tend to have diminished immune responses compared with younger adults,14 increasing vaccination rates to protect elderly people, potentially using vaccine products which lead to more vigorous immune response, is also fundamental. Recently, several influenza vaccines that could have a better action have been tested in elderly people. The use of adjuvanted sub\u2010unit vaccine (MF59) has been proven to be effective in reducing several influenza\u2010related outcomes among the elderly, especially hospitalizations due to influenza\u2010related complications.15 Compared with standard\u2010dose influenza vaccine, high\u2010dose vaccine was also found to reduce hospital admission with respiratory illness16, 17, 18 and to be cost\u2010saving.19, 20 Finally, a recombinant influenza vaccine has been shown to provide a better protection in older adults than the standard quadrivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine.21 At present, the availability of these newer vaccine products is limited in many settings, and where available, they may be cost\u2010prohibitive. With this in mind, implementing a realistic vaccination strategy with available product in order to improve influenza vaccine coverage should be considered as the first\u2010line strategy with whatever influenza vaccine available in a given country.",

Key challenges for the future are sustainability, good quality data and more private\u2010academic collaborations under a common scientific umbrella. A unified group of committed national experts, that is MENA\u2010ISN with joint multisectoral and multidisciplinary efforts, will help to get further than individual efforts. The network can be the active advocate for acceptance of vaccination by HCPs and the public, by bringing key local stockholders together, explaining benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination and addressing misinformation. Dissemination of surveillance and disease burden data through publications and effective communication tools will help to push health authorities in favour of official recommendations for influenza vaccination.",
