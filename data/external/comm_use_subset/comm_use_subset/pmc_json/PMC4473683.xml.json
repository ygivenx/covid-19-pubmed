Importantly, the prevalence of a specific G272S replacement (that also occurred in combination with S223N) increased over time. Interestingly, these aa substitutions are highly specific for Egyptian H5N1 viruses and not conserved or very rare in the HA proteins of viruses isolated in other parts of Africa or in Europe and America. To obtain further evidence for a potentially increased pandemic risk associated with H5N1 HPAIV carrying these mutations, we characterized the respective mutations in the structural context of an HA of an IAV strain from another geographical region. To this end, we introduced 10 mutations (alone and/or in combination) into the HA coding sequence of the prototype Asian strain A/Thailand/KAN-1/2004 (KAN-1, H5N1) and determined the A(0.236)/A(0.076) amplitude ratios (Supplementary Table S2). Among all the mutations tested, K153D, S223(N,I) and G272S were found to increase the amplitude at the frequency F(0.236) most profoundly, the latter representing the frequency determined for human-adapted IAV strains (Fig. 1). The amplitude increase at F(0.236) was linked to an amplitude reduction at F(0.076), indicating an improved interaction with the avian receptor. The A(0.236)/A(0.076) ratio was found to be increased from 0.77 to 1.26, suggesting an increased pandemic potential for viruses carrying these mutations (see above). As indicated above, the prevalence of the G272S mutation in H5N1-HA sequences isolated from virus strains circulating in Egypt has strongly increased since 2009, particularly in viruses isolated from humans (from 5.6% in 2009 to 95.7% in 2011, see Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, the (only) two HA sequences determined in 2012 for Egyptian isolates of human HAPIV were shown to carry the double mutation G272S/S223N.",

Confluent cell monolayers were infected with parental or mutant viruses at an MOI of 0.001 FFU/cell and maintained in trypsin-containing cell culture medium. Virus titers in supernatants collected at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h p.i. were determined as FFU/ml on MDCK-II cells40. In MDCK-SIAT1 cells (Fig. 7a), the titersof all mutants were approximately 0.5 log10 FFU/ml higher than that of the KAN-1 (Wt-LP) at 24\u201336 h p.i. However, at 48 h p.i., the M-III virus showed a significant increase in titer of about 1.0 log10 FFU/ml compared to both the parental KAN-1 (Wt-LP) and the other two mutants (Fig. 7a). Conversely, in QT6 (Fig. 7b) and A549 (Fig. 7c) cells, the parental KAN-1 (Wt-LP) and M-III viruses replicated to similar titers with no apparent differences in infectious particle number. In contrast, M-I and -II virus titers were significantly reduced by 0.5\u20131.0 log10 FFU/ml compared to the parental KAN-1 (Wt-LP) virus at 24\u201348 h p.i (Fig. 7b,c). Taken together, these results suggest that the triple mutation in HA (K153D/S223N/G272S; Mut-III) enhances viral replication in cells that overexpress \u03b12,6-SA (MDCK-SIAT1), while there was no such difference in A549 and QT6 cells, which express low(er) amounts of \u03b12,6-SA (compared to MDCK-SIAT1). The double mutants, S223N/G272S and K153D/S223N (Mut-I, Mut-II), also replicated more efficiently in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. However, in this case, the increase was much less profound compared to the triple mutant. In A549 and QT6 cells, the double mutants replicated to lower titers compared to both the parental virus and the triple mutant, possibly indicating that the binding to \u03b12,3-SA was reduced in these mutants.",

Importantly, S223N and, particularly, G272S have also been detected in H5N1 HPAIVs circulating in Egypt and the number of viruses carrying these mutations has significantly increased since 2008 (Supplementary Table S1), correlating with an increasing number of human H5N1 infections in this country. The fact that the number of human cases in Egypt did not increase more dramatically in recent years might reflect a need for further adaptive requirements, for example in the receptor binding domain. Interestingly, S223N substitutions were only detected in human samples and combinations of the two aa substitutions were detected in both human H5N1 HPAIV HA sequences reported in 2012, further supporting the significance of these aa substitutions in viral adaptation to human hosts and suggesting an increased pandemic potential for H5N1 HPAIV strains currently circulating in Egypt (Supplementary Table S1).",

Amino acid mutations K153R and S223N/G were shown to alter the antigenic properties and/or receptor specificity34464748. However, it is currently not clear if the recently reported adaptive substitution G272S in the H5-HA protein of Egyptian isolates has similar effects on the receptor specificity20. In a recent attempt to establish a model that predicts the evolution of the viral population, the analysis of 3,944 HA sequences from H3N2 IAV revealed that adaptive mutations, which influence biological and immunological properties of these viruses, occur with highest probability within the epitopes A\u2013D49. The alterations at the three selected positions (153, 223, 272) investigated here are also located within epitopes A, B and C, suggesting that with high probability such variations can be expected to occur also in H5-type HA of HPAIV as a consequence of natural viral adaptation.",

Notably, ISM analyses of double and triple mutations consistently showed a decrease in amplitude at the frequency for avian receptor usage (0.076) accompanied by an increase at the frequency for human receptor usage (0.236). This was more pronounced for the triple mutation (Supplementary Table S2). Even though the triple mutations substantially decreased the amplitude of the avian frequency compared to wildtype (Supplementary Table S2), the results shown in Fig. 7B indicate no decrease of viral replication in QT6 cells. We think that combinations of mutations do not only affect long-range interaction properties of HA1 but may also affect its 3D structure. For this reason, the triple mutation (even though it increases the calculated efficacy of recognition and targeting between HA1 and the human receptor) might not necessarily disturb the chemical binding to the avian receptor.",

The data show that mutants containing combined S223N and G272S replacements produce larger foci in mammalian MDCK cells (Fig. 6).

Previously, studies into the pandemic potential for humans were largely focused on HPAIV of the H5N1 and H7N3/H7N7 subtypes. While H5N1 HPAIV are known to cause severe disease in humans and many birds, the H7-type is generally associated with mild disease in humans but causes fatal disease in a wide range of birds including economically relevant species (chicken, turkeys, etc.)5253. However, recent work shows that also specific H7-type HPAIV strains have the potential to replicate in mammalian species4054. These observations have led to more extensive research and monitoring efforts to better understand the specific pathogenic and epidemiological characteristics of these HPAIV. Additionally, the large group of LPAIV and the recently documented H7N9, H10N8 and H6N1 LPAIV cases in humans extend the list of subtypes potentially causing human disease and thus deserve further studies5556. The increasing number of cases with IAV subtypes not considered previously to cause disease in humans highlights the need to develop new tools (including in silico methods) that are suitable to closely monitor the biological properties (tropism, pathogenic potential in specific species, etc.) of circulating IAV strains and identify mutations indicative of CPIV. These tools might help the health authorities, healthcare systems, and vaccine manufacturers to plan ahead and respond earlier to newly emerging IAVs with pandemic potential. The bioinformatic method used in the present study to define mutations in H5N1 IAV that indicate viral adaptation to humans and thus increase the pandemic potential of these viruses may be a suitable tool to identify CPIV among circulating influenza viruses in different populations.",
