During the 2012\u20132013 influenza season in the United States, influenza virus caused an estimated 633,001 hospitalizations including 27,810 deaths [1]. Due to the potential severity of this disease and the fast mutation rate of the virus, a large global surveillance network is required to monitor circulating strains in order to characterize variants and select regional vaccines. In 2014, over 300,000 influenza samples were collected in 124 countries [2] and global surveillance efforts deposited over 80,000 gene segments in GenBank and GISAID. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, over 6500 influenza gene segments were sequenced in 2014. About 1 out of every 4 of these segments was generated using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. In 2015, almost all gene segments were sequenced using NGS (93 % of 23,000 generated). Next generation sequencing of influenza viruses, compared to traditional methods (such as Sanger sequencing), increases sample multiplexing by up to 48 fold and coverage depths by up to 1000 fold. These benefits allow for greater overall throughput and increased accuracy in studying sub-populations within viral samples; however, keeping up with the NGS data deluge is challenging, particularly for influenza viruses.",

These genes segments code for hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (M1), ion-channel protein (M2), nucleoprotein (NP), non-structural protein (NS) and three polymerase proteins (P1, PB1, and PB2). The polymerase complex typically generates one spontaneous mutation during each replication cycle [3], thereby accounting for a mean substitution rate of 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year [3]. Moreover, a single host that has been simultaneously infected with two or more different virus strains can serve as a mixing vessel in which novel virions are formed. This process, known as virus reassortment, can cause outbreaks of infection, with potentially dire consequences, if the new virus is both pathogenic and readily transmitted.",

Antigenic drift and shift events create virus strains that may not be efficiently captured in host immune responses generated by current vaccines and it is therefore important to track changes in all gene segments during surveillance of circulating influenza virus strains. Until recently, only HA, NA and M gene segment changes of circulating human seasonal influenza virus strains were routinely tracked, but the emergence and detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza strains caused a rapid expansion in surveillance efforts for zoonotic viruses to the extent that sequencing of all gene segments of avian and swine viruses is now typical and routine. Likewise, using NGS technologies, it is now not only feasible but also routine to sequence all gene segments of the comparatively large number of sampled seasonal human influenza viruses.",

Typical reference-based NGS assembly programs were written for eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms with non-segmented genomes [5\u20138] that undergo slower mutation rates than RNA viruses. These programs discard read sequences from assembly that have too many mismatches or insertions/deletions (indels) versus a defined reference sequence within some configurable scoring threshold. Read sequences containing variants are more frequently discarded from reference-based assemblies due to an overall mismatch to the reference and it is possible, therefore, for thousands of acceptable reads to be excluded, thereby minimizing overall coverage and preventing complete assembly. Because RNA viruses may contain phased minor variants at almost any frequency or position, a unique approach is required to efficiently assemble NGS virus reads while maximizing overall coverage, even when high coverage depths are achieved.",

While previous solutions have addressed specific challenges such as quality control [5], variant calling [6, 7], phasing [8], and assembly [9], IRMA provides a comprehensive solution to address each aspect of NGS assembly, as it applies to RNA virus evolution, in a flexible and robust manner and has been used successfully to identify low frequency indel variants in ebolavirus populations [10].",

IRMA automates quality control, such as the removal of short, low quality, and chimeric reads, and gives options for reference elongation to discover novel untranslated regions (UTRs). In order to handle the ever growing demand for high volume sequence assembly and analysis, IRMA parallelizes tasks at almost every stage\u2014by single multi-core computer or by grid\u2014and integrates different tools and options to let the user determine the appropriate burden of compute time versus accuracy. Named configuration files are used to adapt assembly options to the strengths of particular deep sequencing platforms while ensuring ease of use and consistency.

Figure 2a shows that host groups (human, swine, or other) are, on average, 16, 32, or 33 mutations apart (per 150 nucleotides) while variation within a host group is quite appreciable (2, 7, or 24 mutations respectively).

We selected BLAT, Bowtie2, and MOSAIK as representatives of local alignment strategies, used YARA and Bowtie2 (end-to-end mode) as an example of semi-global alignment, and LABEL for machine learning and statistical approaches (see section Random subsequence datasets (Fig. 3 & Additional file 1)). Figure 3a illustrates that a 10 % difference from the assembly reference (15/150nts) is enough to start losing sensitivity for local aligners, and by design, for semi-global aligners. LABEL (used to sort reads into segment bins in the IRMA pipeline) uses profile hidden Markov models along with a support vector machine for classification of reads instead of capturing them based on overall match to a reference set [11]. Capturing reads using a statistical model is expected to be more sensitive to actual influenza diversity. On the other hand, using a reference sequence is much more computationally expedient. Figure 3b shows how read misclassification (matching to influenza, but the wrong subtype or gene segment) can also occur for more sensitive approaches. This is consistent with the well-known [14] trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that can hamper the accuracy of more permissive classifiers. For example, our attempts to increase BLAT\u2019s sensitivity by relaxing read matching criteria (Fig. 3c) provided diminishing returns (0.12 % more matches from 80 to 60 % minimum identity) while increasing the rate of flu read misclassification.",

One can attempt to do so using accurate estimates of sequencer error, as discussed in later sections. However, the disconcerting issue is that genetic variability is compounded with the variability introduced by sequencing error, making the capture of distant reads even more difficult for RNA virus assembly. Given the reality of sequencing error and LABEL\u2019s use of genetic diversity to train its algorithm, we reassessed the four best method\u2019s sensitivity and classification accuracy on influenza data with artificially mutated sample subsequences from a set of references at various fixed distances (see section Influenza A(H3N2) genetic diversity, (Fig. 2)). Additional file 1 shows that sensitivity begins to drop after a 7 to 17 % difference from the reference set (depending on method). LABEL sensitivity is lower for artificial variation than for genetic variation (Fig. 3), due to its reliance on a training set of actual influenza sequences. Misclassification appears at 25 nucleotide differences (of 150nts) for most methods, except for YARA, which has a maximum edit distance. As an alternative LABEL strategy, the LABEL \u201ctrio\u201d set of modules succeeds in reducing misclassification by focusing on classifying HA, NA and the internal gene segments separately (see section Influenza A(H3N2) genetic diversity, (Fig. 2) as well as Additional file 2). We therefore have chosen to use the LABEL \u201ctrio\u201d module set in IRMA\u2019s sorting step (Fig. 1b, step 4) to balance sensitivity & accuracy.",

IRMA accomplishes this task by sorting reads (Fig. 1b, step 4) using LABEL, an accurate (Fig. 3, Additional file 1) machine learning approach that rejects non-flu-like reads (Additional file 2). Moreover, by performing an all reference versus all read match step (Fig. 1b, step 3) prior to determining the best match, IRMA can utilize sub-optimal matches to identify and filter out chimeric reads, reducing assembly noise. IRMA\u2019s read gathering phase (Fig. 1b, steps 1\u20135) aids variant calling by increasing coverage depth and breadth. Read mapping is optimized by Smith-Waterman (Fig. 1b, step 6) in order to increase assembly accuracy.
