In January 2010, the project case definition for SARI was modified to encompass all patients \u226531 days of age meeting the CDC International Emerging Infection Program (IEIP) pneumonia case definition [10]. In January 2012, the project SARI case definition was changed to the revised WHO SARI case definition (2011), which applied to all cases of any age [11]. While changes in case definitions were designed to enhance their clarity and ease of use, case definitions adopted in January 2010 and January 2012 were broader, increasing sensitivity (Table 1). SARI cases testing positive for influenza virus were considered influenza-associated hospitalizations.",

The season was then defined as from the start of the month with the lowest average number of cases to the end of the previous month in the next year (July 1 to June 30).

Isolation of influenza virus from a patient meeting the SARI case definition does not prove causality as influenza has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals in several studies [22]. Although the SARI case definition broadened over the course of the study, it likely does not fully capture all cases that might be hospitalized with respiratory illness due to influenza [11]. Moreover, it is likely that the broadening of the case definition resulted in increases in the number of patients enrolled and influenza cases detected. There may also have been limitations in the performance of surveillance. All participating hospitals provided care across the age spectrum, but SARI cases were predominately under five years of age and there were few deaths among the elderly. It is possible that the SARI case definition is less sensitive for elderly patients than for pediatric cases, that there was less surveillance among medical wards with elderly patients, or that healthcare seeking behavior of the elderly differs from that of children with a greater tendency for health seeking in young children. While efforts were made to regularly train staff in active case finding, no audits were done to assess how well or how completely the case definitions were applied. Consequently, there is the potential that differential effort was made in capturing pediatric versus adult cases for enrollment and testing.",
