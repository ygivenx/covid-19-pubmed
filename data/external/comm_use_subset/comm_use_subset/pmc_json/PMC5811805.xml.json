The Institutional Review Boards of the hospital sites (Daklak, Dong Thap, Hue, and Khanh Hoa) submitted the official document approvals to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) local ethics committee. The HTD then gave ethical approval (approval no. CS/ND/13/28). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or from parents/legal guardians if the patient was a child prior to enrolment into the study. In and outpatients with a clinical diagnosis of ARI were recruited from four provincial hospitals (in Cao Lanh, Dong Thap; Buon Me Thuot, Dak Lak; Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa; and Hue). The study inclusion criteria consisted of fever or history of fever of less than 7 days and respiratory symptoms as the chief complaint. On the day of enrollment, nose and throat swabs were collected from each patient in separate tubes containing 1ml of sterile viral transport medium (VTM, including MEM Hanks: 500ml, gelatin 5%: 50ml and antibiotics (antbiotics: penicillin 100UI/mlVTM + streptomycin 100mg/ml VTM : 5ml and Amphotericin B 250ug/ml: 3ml). Samples were stored at -80\u00b0C and transported in batches on dry ice to the laboratory of Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, where the nose and throat swabs were pooled for subsequent analysis as per study protocols. Four hundred forty-two samples were simultaneously tested with the Luminex assay and reference assays.",
