            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a poultry disease caused by Coronavirus of Nidovirales order [1]. Coronavirus is enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, and RNA\u2019s positive sense, comprises approximately 27\u201332 Kb in size [2]. All Coronaviruses have four structural proteins, glycoprotein spike, matrix, nucleoprotein, and envelope consist of lipid bilayer and three glycoprotein M, S, and HE [3]. The S protein has two glycopolypeptide components which are S1 and S2. The spike protein S1 undergoes inhibitor of agglutination and induces neutralizing antibody [2]. S1 protein functioned as differentiating factor among IB virus (IBV) strains and as a main target of genotype characterization. It also plays an important role in attachment and virus entries into cells through cyanic acid receptor [4]. Amino acid variation in glycoprotein S1 took important place to tissue tropism and IB virulence [5].",

Outbreaks were also occurred at vaccinated flocks, indicating vaccination failure; however, vaccination is the only practical means of controlling IB. Problem in vaccination is that it is only partially successful due to the continual emergence of antigenic variants. IBV strains within a geographic region are unique, even many countries share same antigenic types, so the selection of an appropriate antigenic type for the region is important, given the existence of wide antigenic variation [7]. The variants of IBV have not been well-documented in Indonesia since the lack of the characterization of this virus [8]. Understanding epidemiological condition and virus changes are important in designing IB vaccination strategies, to provide greater protection against enzootic strains, and the vaccination must be commonly practiced based on the field needs [9].",

These viruses belonged to four serotypes group: One group close to IBV Mass, another close to IBV Conn, and the other two groups close to IBV from Australia [10]. The emergence of IBV variants in Indonesia was first detected by Dharmayanti et al. [16], and later on, the study of IBV variants was conducted by Dharmayanti and Indriani [8] which detected IBV variants close to Taiwan and China strain. IBV has a high capacity for genetic change through mutation, and these genetic mechanisms might lead to emergence of new IBV serotypes and variants and evolution of IBV also influenced by application of multiple vaccine strain [17-19]. Therefore, updating epidemiological status of IBV through genetic characterization is important for designing appropriate vaccination program in a certain region.",

Determinant region for IB serotyping was located in the first 395 amino acid of S1 gene. Amino acid epitopes play an important role in virus critical antigenic were located at position 296 (amino acid Glutamine, Threonine and Alanine replaced by Histidine, Threonine and Alanine or Serine, Threonine and Alanine) and position 378 (amino acid Proline, Arginine and Glycine replaced by Proline Arginine Leucine, these substitutions cause decreasing of vaccine protection and produced new IBV strain.
