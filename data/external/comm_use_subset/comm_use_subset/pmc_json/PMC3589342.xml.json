            "text": "The 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza pandemic [1], the SARS epidemic in 2003 [2], and the recent emergence of a novel coronavirus [3] are recent reminders of the global health threat posed by zoonotic viruses. Prior to widespread emergence in human populations, such pathogens can cause occasional infections in sub-populations that have been exposed to reservoir species (common reservoir species include for example bats, birds, swine, non-human primates). Whilst viruses causing such \u201cspill-over\u201d infections are usually poorly adapted for sustained human-to-human transmission, they are under strong selection pressure to increase transmissibility once in humans [4]. If the reproduction number R (i.e., the average number of persons infected by a case) evolves to exceed 1, a large scale epidemic in humans may result. Over the last decade, particular concerns were raised regarding highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, due to the high mortality rate seen in humans and the virus's rapid spread in avian populations. However, as the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza pandemic demonstrated, H5N1 is not the only influenza virus that may pose a pandemic risk. Recently, a swine-origin triple reassortant influenza A(H3N2) variant virus has emerged in the United States, carrying the matrix gene (M) from the H1N1pdm09 virus (H3N2v-M) [2]\u2013[4]. Studies in animal models have suggested that the presence of the H1N1pdm09 M gene may increase transmissibility of the virus [5],[6]. From January 2012 to September 2012, 307 laboratory-confirmed H3N2v-M human infections were reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5] as opposed to 12 throughout 2011 [6]. The majority of cases have been associated with agricultural fairs but there are documented events of human-to-human transmission [7]. The surge in cases observed in summer 2012 raised public health concerns [8]. Threats from zoonoses are not limited to influenza: more than half of all recent emerging infectious disease events were zoonotic [9].",

One approach to such risk assessment is by monitoring the reproduction number R of zoonoses in humans, with an alarm being raised if R increases or approaches 1 [9]\u2013[11]. However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters [10],[11] and suffered from three important limitations: (1) the resources, access, and expertise needed to conduct investigations is not always available; (2) the proportion of cases that are missed during outbreak investigations may vary by setting and be difficult to assess; (3) even if the study is complete, the data collection process can be affected by a selection bias whereby larger outbreaks are more likely to be detected so that estimates of transmissibility may be biased upward. Consider for example a scenario where R = 0.7, where each case has the same detection probability \u03c1 = 1%, and assume that once a cluster is detected, detailed outbreak investigation ensures that all cases in the cluster are detected. With an average size of 18.3 and a 21% probability of 1-case cluster, clusters that are detected are substantially larger than normal ones (average size: 3.3; 65% probability of 1-case cluster) (Figure 1A). As expected, this selection bias leads to R being overestimated as illustrated for methods that use the distribution of detected cluster sizes (Figure 1B) [10].",

When the case detection rate \u03c1 is relatively low, at levels similar to those seen in sentinel systems like the US influenza virological surveillance network, the straight line dependence shown in Figure 2 illustrates that R can be estimated as R = 1\u2212F (see Methods and Text S1). We find that it takes relatively high levels of case detection (\u03c1) or case-to-case variation in infectiousness (k) to cause substantial deviations from this linear relationship, and even then, such deviation only occurs for values of R close to 1 (Figure 2). We also find that the relationship is only weakly sensitive to having multiple chains of transmission per cluster of human cases (Figure S1; Text S1).",

However, assume that \u03c1 is unknown and that we plan to use estimator 1\u2212F, which is unbiased so long as \u03c1 is small. As the detection rate \u03c1 increases, so does the bias of estimator 1\u2212F. However, for a fixed number of clusters occurring in the study population, larger detection rates increase precision through larger sample sizes. There is therefore a trade-off between the bias and precision of the estimator 1\u2212F. This is illustrated in Figure 4A, for a scenario with reproduction number R = 0.5, overdispersion parameter k = 0.5 and where a total of 10,000 clusters occur. In this scenario, the optimum (i.e., minimizing the root mean square error) trade-off in bias versus precision is obtained for a detection rate of \u03c1 = 1.5%. We find that the optimum detection rate for estimator 1\u2212F is a decreasing function of the reproduction number R and the total number of clusters n, but an increasing function of overdispersion parameter k (Figure 4B). We also find that the absolute bias at the optimum detection rate remains relatively small (<0.06) (Figure 4C). In Figure S5 and Text S1, we show that thinning the data may eliminate the bias of the 1\u2212F estimator, though combining information from F and G (see below) is a simpler and more convenient approach to the same goal.",

Nipah virus is primarily clinically characterized by fever and encephalitis and was first discovered in a large outbreak in Malaysia in 1998\u20131999 [17],[18]. During this outbreak (where sick pigs were believed to be the natural reservoir), Parashar et al. [19] conducted a case-control study of the risk factors for infection. They recruited patients who were hospitalized with encephalitis from January through April 1999. Candidate encephalitis patients whose serum specimen tested positive for Nipah antibody were included as cases. Other cases were detected through targeted investigations; but if we restrict analyses to the subset of patients detected through hospital surveillance, this situation resembles surveillance scenario 1 above, where the probability of being detected is independent of cluster allocation. Here, we can therefore estimate the reproduction number as R = 1\u2212G. Probability G can be approximated using the data of Parashar et al. [19] by the proportion of cases who (1) either lived or worked in a farm (G\n1) or (2) handled a pig, or came within 1 m of a pig and came into contact with pig urine or faeces (G\n2). Parashar et al. [19] only give estimates for the pooled set of cases (i.e., hospital surveillance+targeted investigations) for which G\n1 = 95% and G\n2 = 92%; however, it should be straightforward to derive these statistics for the subset of cases detected through hospital surveillance alone.

Luby et al. identified 23 introductions of Nipah virus into human populations in central and northwestern Bangladesh from 2001 to 2007 [21]. They classified 60 of the 122 identified Nipah virus cases as reservoir-to-human infections (G = 49%). Using the simple estimator R = 1\u2212G, we obtain R = 0.51. This is consistent with more detailed contact tracing data that estimated R = 0.48 [21]. However, both these estimators may be biased upwards as the Bengali situation corresponds to surveillance scenario 2 (i.e., detection of a case may trigger an outbreak investigation), which may lead to the selection bias discussed earlier. In such a context, we recommend running our analysis on the subset of first detected cases in each of the 23 introductions and estimating proportion F. Again, it should be possible to derive F from data collected at the time. Since the case detection rate is unknown, we expect 1\u2212F to act as a lower bound for R (Figure 5). From the estimates of G and F, we should therefore be able to derive simple bounds on R:\n.",

Second, the statistical treatment of the data is extremely simple, making it possible for anyone to interpret raw surveillance statistics about the source of infection of cases (statistics G or F) in terms of human-to-human transmissibility (reproduction number R). Third, the method is robust to selection bias (i.e., the fact that larger clusters are more likely to be detected) and under-ascertainment (i.e., ability to detect all cases in a cluster once a cluster is identified).",

In the US H3N2v-M context, where most individuals have no contact with swine, it is usually relatively easy to rule out the natural reservoir as a source of infection. Determining the source of infection might however be harder in situations where a large part of the population has regular contacts with the natural reservoir (e.g., backyard poultry in rural areas). In this case, an in-depth epidemiological investigation of the potential sources of infection is required. Clearly our approach cannot be used if the zoonotic source has not been identified yet. That being said, the examples we have presented show that proxy measures for the source of transmission (e.g., contacts with the natural reservoir) are often available. Although imperfect, these proxy measures are often already used by the scientific and public health community. For example, the World Health Organization fact sheet on Nipah virus states that \u201cin Bangladesh, half of reported cases between 2001 and 2008 were due to human-to-human transmission\u201d [23]. Our methods improve this existing practice in at least three ways: (1) it adds an essential layer of interpretation by providing estimates of the reproduction number, R, which allows assessment of how far transmission is from being sustained (R\u22651); (2) it clarifies sources of potential biases; and (3) it provides simple guidelines to reduce these biases (see summary in Box 1).",

If human-to-human cases are prone to be classified as reservoir-to-human transmission, R may be underestimated. If the source of infection is uncertain, the analysis of detailed outbreak data [11],[24] might allow estimation of the probability that the case was infected by the reservoir, which could then be used to estimate F and R using our methods. Phylogenetic analysis might also help resolve uncertainties about the source of infection. Clearly, our approach will start to break down if the proportion of cases with missing data becomes too large or if the classification of cases is too unreliable.
