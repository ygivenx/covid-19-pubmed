In Asia Pacific (East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania), recent ISAAC (International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) surveys revealed varying trends in childhood asthma across this economically and culturally diverse region [2,3]. Studies in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Japan, and Singapore, among others, have shown declining trends in asthma mortality and hospitalization, and these trends have also been examined in relation to changing patterns of asthma drug use [4-7]. However, most studies did not focus on the pediatric age group and less developed countries in this region.",

Extracting absolute asthma deaths was possible only in less than 5 countries studied that adopted the ICD-10 coding system, in which deaths due to asthma were separately classified. Because Anderson et al [19] found that in 5- to 14-year-olds asthma constitutes 89.8% of deaths under the B323 category and a temporal trend in deaths coded B323 reflected mainly that of asthma, asthma mortality rates of the same age group in each country were calculated using the total number of asthma deaths, by proxy of deaths coded ICD-9 B323 or its equivalent in ICD-10 (J40-43, J45-46), divided by the total population to maintain consistency.

Drug utilization patterns in terms of the ratio of corticosteroids to bronchodilators (C:B) have been demonstrated to be a reliable indicator of quality of asthma prescribing in primary care, and it is also associated with asthma outcomes [20,21]. In this study, drug utilization patterns were examined through a modified C:B, where we defined controller-to-reliever ratio (C:R) as the ratio of the total number of units of controllers (ICS and its combinations) to the total number of units of relievers (SABA) sold in each selected country. C:R was chosen in consideration of the Global Initiative for Asthma program guidelines in asthma prescribing, which recommend as needed SABA with the option of adding a controller to achieve asthma control [22]. In addition, expressing drug utilization patterns as C:R circumvents the problem of missing population data from the WHO mortality database for some countries.",

The higher rates of current wheeze in these countries have been attributed to higher degrees of urbanization and westernization [1,25]. These countries are also more affluent, and it is plausible that the quality of and access to health care is better. Further, the higher prevalence of asthma could have encouraged local health authorities or health care institutions to place a greater emphasis on management of asthma. In Australia, where asthma prevalence is one of the highest in the world,[24,25] organizations like the National Asthma Council Australia [26] and Asthma Foundations Australia [27] have been set up to improve the quality of life of asthma sufferers. Similarly, the Singapore National Asthma Program (SNAP) was implemented in 2001, with the goal to ease asthma burden by encouraging the use of controllers and reducing the reliance on relievers, among other initiatives [28].",

There was a sharp decline in asthma hospitalization rates following the SARS outbreak. This observation further suggests that hospital admissions for asthma in developed countries may be affected by extraneous factors. One of the reasons for the drop in asthma hospitalizations could be due to changes in hospital policies that resulted in the prohibition of nebulizer use. In its replacement, metered-dose inhalers with spacers, which were also more readily available in households, were used. This practice could also explain the sharp decline in C:R. The total number of units of relievers sold in 2004 (924,700 units) more than doubled that in 2003 (409,400 units). Similar changes were not observed in other countries affected by SARS. The low asthma hospitalization rates and C:R were sustained in the years after SARS in Hong Kong SAR. Although difficult to verify, the practice of health-seeking behaviors like frequent hand washing, adherence to doctors' advice, regular exercise, and frequent use of masks when having symptoms of influenza post-SARS as described by Lau et al [30] may have reduced respiratory viral infections and, therefore, viral-triggered wheezing. Hospitals in Hong Kong SAR also continued to abide by the policy introduced during SARS, prohibiting use of nebulizers, which possibly explains the sustained high reliever sales.",

Thus, it is prudent to note that medication is only 1 aspect of asthma management, reflected by the opposing mortality and hospitalization trends observed in different countries.
