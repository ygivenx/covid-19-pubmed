Using Bioinformatics and data-mining analysis of published P. falciparum transcriptomes and proteomes [24, 25], we identified PfSRA to be reminiscent of a surface protein, defined by the presence of a signal peptide and a predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment signal [28, 29]. Indeed, PfSRA has been shown to have PfSUB-1 cleavage sites that were assigned using the Prediction of Protease Specificity analysis platform [25]. The presence of these proteolytic cleavage sites in PfSRA may allude to processing events occurring prior to invasion of erythrocytes. Besides, proteolytic processing in the malaria parasite has been shown to be relevant for cascades of interaction occurring at the parasite\u2013host cell interface [21, 30]. Furthermore, because orthologs are good candidates for multispecies vaccines, we generated sequence alignments with other PfSRA orthologs, which showed that the C-terminus of PfSRA has 5 positionally conserved cysteine residues across the different species orthologs. Our attempt to express the recombinant PfSRA that possesses 67% unstructured regions was unsuccessful. Similarly, others have attempted the expression of the mature recombinant PfSRA in HEK293E cells using a codon-optimized gene (Geneart) and have also been unsuccessful [28]. Considering that PfSRA is an asparagine-rich protein with numerous potential N-linked glycosylation sites, we did not attempt expression in insect cells because the system produces proteins with more complex N-linked glycosylation [31] that may not present the relevant sugar epitopes of native glycosylation [32]. Therefore, the challenges associated with the expression of recombinant PfSRA necessitated the design of chemically synthetized peptides for an epitope-based vaccine strategy.",

Interestingly, these domains have been evaluated as potential targets for peptide-based vaccines [38\u201340]. The 3 PfSRA peptide antibodies from rabbits specifically detected breakdown products of native PfSRA in ring-stage invasion supernatant or parasite culture supernatant and schizont lysates. This indicated that PfSRA synthetic peptides are antigenic mimics of the native parasite protein. Our data showed that PfSRA is postsynthetically processed by cleavage into parasite culture supernatant, and this is consistent with the PfSUB-1 cleavage sites it harbors. The merozoite surface is remodeled by a series of proteolytic processing events; the physiological relevance of these events in the malaria parasite remains poorly described. However, there are reports suggesting that proteolytic processing may result in activation, structural rearrangement, or acquisition of other new functional properties of native parasite proteins [41].",

Interestingly, all 3 rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies showed circumferential association on the merozoite surface at the timing of schizont rupture and merozoite release. Similarly, we performed colabeling in IFAs with gametocytes (stage II\u2013V) using all 3 rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies with the gametocyte surface marker Pfs48/45. A clear, punctate rim-fluorescence pattern was observed for all 3 rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies that appeared to colocalize with Pfs48/45 in a stage-dependent manner based on the colocalization coefficient. Therefore, the consistency in the staining patterns of all 3 rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies in both asexual and gametocyte stages suggested that proteolytic processing of PfSRA does not cause changes in the subcellular localization of the protein. Although the distribution of proteins in male or female gametocytes could be linked to functional divergence between the sexes [45], we observed the expression of PfSRA in both male and female gametocytes. Consistent with this observation is an existing report on Plasmodium berghei gametocyte egress and sporozoite traversal protein (PbGEST) expression in both sexes [46].",

Our serological screens, buttressed by immuno-dot blot assays, with plasma samples from malaria-infected children residing at different endemic sites showed differences in total IgG recognition frequencies for PfSRA peptides. This could be linked to varying transmission intensity rates as reported for samples collected from different endemic sites in previous studies [33, 47]. In most cases, the reactivity of all 3 PfSRA synthetic peptides was low, and the likely explanation for this could be the hindered accessibility of PfSRA in the native context. However, our data from IFAs showed that the immuno-affinity purified, human \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies labeled native PfSRA, which suggests that malaria-infected populations have naturally acquired antibodies against PfSRA.",

We have shown that the 32-kDa\u2013processed fragment of native PfSRA binds normal human erythrocytes, but the molecular identity of the receptor remains unknown. However, we have classified the putative receptor for PfSRA as sialic acid\u2013dependent on the basis of its binding specificity, which is sensitive to treatments with both neuraminidase and trypsin but resistant to chymotrypsin, a binding phenotype that fits the description of the receptor glycophorin C. The enzyme sensitivity profile of PfSRA binding to erythrocytes is similar to that observed for PfEBA-140 (region II), the parasite ligand for glycophorin C [49]. Additional investigations are required to determine whether PfSRA also interacts with glycophorin C, possibly via a different binding site.",

The reactivity of the 4 synthetic peptides, R1-peptide that blocks PfAMA 1-PfRON4 complex (A), PfSRA P1 (B), PfSRA P2 (C), and PfSRA P3 (D) with plasma samples from children with malaria residing in different transmission zones in Ghana (Kintampo, Navrongo, and Accra) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Naive plasma was used as control. Shown are immunoglobulin G levels in the respective plasma samples at 1:100 dilution, and reactivity was expressed as optical density at 462 nm. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v.6.01 and presented as scatter dot plots summarized as mean and standard error of the mean. Site-to-site comparisons (12 samples per site) were performed using the Krukal\u2013Wallis H test with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test. The significance of the differences between respective peptide reactivities with plasma samples across the sites was based on the adjusted P values (.05).
