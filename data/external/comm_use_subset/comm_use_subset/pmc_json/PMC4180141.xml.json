            "text": "While the recent swine flu pandemic was luckily less severe than initially thought, there remains a constant threat of mutated or reassorted influenza strains that give rise to new outbreaks that could range from small local clusters [1] to seasonal epidemics [2] or even global pandemics [3, 4]. Similarly, history has also shown us that previously unknown pathogens such as the SARS coronavirus could emerge and cause serious outbreaks [5]. Just in 2012 and 2013, there were 2 new outbreaks of different viruses with pandemic potential, MERS-CoV [6] and H7N9 [7], triggering increased surveillance alerts. Respiratory diseases often manifest themselves through similar flu-like symptoms and early detection of new outbreaks is of central importance in order to delay or prevent their escalation and wider spread. However, classical surveillance systems are mostly relying on time-delayed and costly virological tests requiring hospital or physician visits [8\u201310].",

Under this context, we make a first attempt on the recognition of typical flu-like symptoms: sneeze and cough actions, and propose a novel discriminative approach which is further evaluated on a new Sneeze-Cough action dataset.",

A series of experiments are conducted with performance analysis that reveals some of the characteristics of this dataset. Our second contribution is two novel types of Action Matching Kernels (AMKs) that are shown to perform competitively comparing to the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we show that Pyramid Match Kernel [11] and Spatial Pyramid Matching [12] are both special cases of the proposed kernels. The kernels are also closely connected to the recent developments in Hough transform [13, 14].",

Very recently a web-based surveillance tool has been developed by Google [17], which is made possible through search engines by taking advantage of the social health-seeking behavior of patients. There are nonetheless concerns that there sometimes exists non-negligible bias in the detection results driven by disease publicity rather than the disease itself. The work presented in this paper, to our best knowledge, is the first to examine this problem with the help of vision-based surveillance and analysis.",

A local feature typically comes with two aspects: a descriptor vector and its space-time location. As the number and locations of the local features are usually not fixed, often a bag-of-words (BoW) method is utilized to map the feature descriptors to a histogram vector in the space spanned by codewords, as in [11, 24, 26], or hierarchical codewords as described in the Pyramid Match Kernel [11]. The BoW representation has demonstrated impressive performance on image and action analysis tasks. Nevertheless it does not retain information regarding space-time layout of the local features.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the spatial (or space-time) layout of local features has long been regarded as an important cue to infer the existence of a global object from local features. The elegant Hough transform [27] is originally devised to detect lines and circles. An important generalization is developed by Ballard [28] to detect objects of arbitrary shapes. Leibe et al. in their seminal work [13] consider a probabilistic variant of the Hough transform, where the BoW model is integrated into the voting space by means of conditional and posteriori probabilities. This is further followed by [14] where a dedicated max-margin learning method is developed. Throughout these methods, a crucial step is the construction of a voting space, where all local features are made to vote for the existence and if so, the location of the global object they belong to. An interesting observation is that this voting space is employed by [14] in an implicit manner. As clearly revealed from Equations (12) and (13) of [14], the model or the parameter vector W is implicitly related to the voting space: W is interpreted as weights for the activations of codewords, where influence from the voting space is implicitly carried out via the activations. A latent variant has also been used for object detection [29].",

Naively this leads to a vector of length K\u00d7K\u00d7S, by accumulating the quantized distance of each feature pair with S possible outcomes. In practice it is further summarized into a more compact vector representation: For a fixed distance, (a) a K-dim vector is extracted from the diagonal elements. (b) a K-dim vector is obtained by summing over all the off-diagonal elements row-wise. For both cases the output vectors are normalized to sum to 1.

A gallery of sample frames are displayed in Figure 3. The data acquisition process is carried out in an indoor environment with semi-controlled lighting condition (sun lights through windows are present in some of the videos), and the camera is mounted on a tripod mimicking the relative height of a typical surveillance camera. Each clip contains one specific action performed by one subject in a particular view and pose. Video shots are normalized at 480 \u00d7 290 resolution, with stream rate of 5 frame per second, each lasts for around 15 seconds. In addition to the two flu-like behaviors, namely sneeze and cough, six common background action types are also included: drinking, phone calling, scratching head, stretching arms, wiping glasses and waving hands. Note we deliberately cover a spectrum of possible background action types that are relatively close to our actions of interest. In addition, each human subject performs each action six times under 2 different poses (standing and walking) and 3 different views (roughly frontal/left/right). We also perform horizontal flip on each video to produce an additional video set of reflective views, which results in a final set of 1920 videos.",

For binary classification, this becomes 2, which however is problematic for datasets with imbalanced class distributions such as Sneeze-Cough: As 3/4 of the Sneeze-Cough examples belongs to background actions category, and using the standard accuracy measure, a rate of 75% is reached when a classifier is biased towards blindly assigning every example to background actions. This leads to the utilization of precision and recall, which are computed by  and , respectively.

First, the actions in this dataset, except for hand-waving, are usually of short time-span, in contrast to actions such as walk or boxing that usually consist of a good number of repetitive action cycles. Second, there exist large variations within the sneeze and cough actions over e.g. different genders, ages, and views. This is further complicated by the fact that the background actions commonly seen in public areas (such as phone calling, scratching head) are often very similar in appearance to flu-like symptoms. Meanwhile these 6 background actions by themselves are highly complex and exhibit large variations as well, as indicated in the sample frames of Figure 3.",

On average, we can see that this dataset is rather challenging. The best method merely reach an accuracy of around 44.4%, which can be partially explained by the large variations within cough/sneeze over various genders/ages/views, as well as their similar space-time appearances to those of the background actions. For both cuboid and HOGHOF local features, we see significant improvement in accuracy by using specific AMKs compared to baseline methods. Take cuboid feature for example, we observe that using the AMK type I kernel with Ub and S=27 leads to an increase of accuracy by 12.5 points. Interestingly, although the best results (i.e., 43.4% vs. 44.4%) are similar for both local features, they are in fact obtained from different type of AMK kernels.",
