The disease was first identified as the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in Central and Northeast China in 2008 [2]. SFTS has an average 12% case fatality rate and even 30% in some areas. Reports that have referred to clinical symptoms of SFTSV infection are either case reports or brief reports, and the detailed clinical features of cases with SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection have not been well described. Several studies have described the factors associated with death in SFTSV patients. However, previously published works assessed risk factors for death by univariate analysis, and the risk factors for severity among SFTS patients and fatality among severe SFTS patients remain to be determined.",

Patients with clinical features of SFTS presented with more serious complications than those of other diseases caused by bunyaviruses (sandfly fever, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, Rift Valley fever and Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever) [4\u20137]. Patients with SFTSV infection in Northeast China are mainly distributed in Liaoning Province.

Suspected encephalitis is defined as people who developed fever with at least 6 hours of altered mental status, or at least 1 hour of unconsciousness, or seizures, or focal neurologic signs. Encephalitis is defined as the presence of decreased consciousness or seizures or altered mental status or focal neurologic signs, plus at least 2 of the following: (a) fever (>38\u00b0C); (b) abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination (pleocytosis >5 white blood cells /mL and/or increased protein content >40 mg/dL) (c) abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) findings compatible with encephalitis (e.g. diffuse or focal slow activity, or periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges); and (d) abnormal results of neuroimaging studies, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [12,13].

For multivariate analysis, only variables with a p value <0.05 were entered into a Cox proportional hazards model and selected using a stepwise selection procedure.

Most of these cases were living in hill areas, and ticks were commonly found in most patients\u2019 home and work environments [22]. It has been confirmed that SFTSV can be transmitted to humans by tick bites, contact with blood from SFTS patients, and personal contact [23,24]. In endemic areas, SFTS occurs most frequently in the summer and autumn seasons, which are suitable for tick activity and consistent with the increasing outdoor activities that increase the risk for exposure to ticks [25]. To date, the true incubation period of the virus has not been established definitively. It has been reported that the incubation period for transmission through tick bite in most SFTS patients ranges from 5 days to 2 weeks [23]. In the present study, the median incubation period for transmission through tick bite in the 7 patients who had a definite history of tick bite was 5 days. However, the delay between the tick bite and the onset of symptoms in 3 of these 7 patients ranged from 2 to 3 weeks, which suggests that the incubation for transmission through tick bite of SFTSV infection may be longer. There were no family cluster or person-to-person transmission of infections by SFTSV reported in this study, so we know little about the incubation of SFTSV infection through person-to-person transmission.",

The elevated markers of liver damage, such as ALT, AST and LDH were observed in majority of the 115 patients, with AST levels typically higher than ALT levels, and were especially pronounced among patients with severe disease. We found that markers of liver damage, such as ALT and AST, were associated with poor prognosis, which is similar to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) [27,28]. In this study, AST levels were disproportionately higher than ALT levels in SFTS patients, which were dramatically higher (2\u20136.2 times higher) in fatal than in non-fatal cases. Some of patients with elevated markers of liver damage had complications, such as pancreatitis, renal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis [18], sepsis and shock. This suggests that elevated AST/ALT ratio is not only associated with liver damage, but also with damage to other tissues, such as muscle, kidney, and pancreas, which could be a direct result of virus infection (and injury) and/or an indirect consequence of cell necrosis [29].",

Abnormal findings of MRI images in the 4 patients with encephalitis were consistent with acute inflammation, and CSF features were also more consistent with acute viral encephalitis. Marked elevation of CK level was observed in patients with limb tremor. The only patient with acute kidney failure and limb tremor was associated with rhabdomyolysis.

Xu et al. have found that elderly patients and those with underlying diseases, neurological manifestations, coagulopathy, or hyponatremia tend to have a poor outcome [20]. In another study, we found that the severity and clinical outcome in patients with novel bunyavirus infection are associated host immune responses [30]. SFTSV also has played a direct role in these fatalities [19,31]. However, these results were assessed by univariate analysis. To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported the risk factors associated with severity in SFTS patients. With a multivariate logistic regression model to control confounding and estimate the direct effects of several possible causal risk factors, we found that hypoalbuminemia, prolonged APTT, hyponatremia, and presence of neurological manifestations were significantly associated with severity in SFTS patients. Among patients with severe SFTS, high serum AST levels, pronounced coagulation disturbances, similar to the previous study, were also associated with fatality, but Cox proportional hazards model showed that the presence of ALI/ARDS and DIC were independent predictors of fatality among patients with severe SFTS.",

Hyponatremia is considered the most prominent change in serum electrolytes in Hantavirus infection, but is rarely serious [33,34]. Acute or symptomatic hyponatremia can lead to significant rates of morbidity and mortality [35,36]. We found that moderate hyponatremia was an independent risk factor for severity in SFTS patients. It has been reported that extremely low (<0.8 mmol/l) concentration of calcium ions is an independent predictor of mortality in critical illness [37]. Hypocalcemia was more serious in fatal than non-fatal cases. In this study, the corrected total serum calcium, not ionized calcium, was investigated. Total serum calcium levels are not reliable, therefore, we can\u2019t assess the association between prognosis and serum calcium. Seven of 11 patients with changes in consciousness had a normal CSF cell count, which suggested other causes, such as electrolyte or other metabolic disturbance may be associated with neurological manifestations.",

Supportive therapy, including intensive monitoring to guide volume is the most essential part of case management. Ribavirin is reported to be effective for treating CCHF infections and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [7,38]. In this study, ribavirin had no influence on clinical outcome in SFTS patients. Due to the retrospective nature of our study, the efficacy of ribavirin in the treatment of SFTS is not clear. Adverse effect associated with ribavirin was also observed. Corticosteroids increase the risk of developing critical disease from viral infections. The use of corticosteroids for the treatment is controversial in SFTS patients with ALI/ARDS. Host immune responses play an important role in determining the severity and clinical outcome in patients with infection by SFTSV [3,30]. Corticosteroids can suppress the cytokine storm. We hoped that the progression of pulmonary disease would be stopped by corticosteroids, which was proved in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [39]. There was no control group, so we can\u2019t determine whether SFTS patients with ALI/ARDS can benefit for administration with corticosteroids. A prospective case-control study is required to evaluate the efficacy of ribavirin and corticosteroid treatment.",

The group may not be representative of hospitalized patients who may not have been tested for SFTSV in 2010. Because there are currently no data on how long SFTSV IgM antibody can persist, the case definition couldn\u2019t exclude patients with positive results for SFTSV IgM who may have had other reasons for disease and have been incidentally found to have IgM.

Due to infection with a novel bunyavirus, the patients may sufferer multiple organ injury and die of multiple organ failure. There are no pathognomonic cluster of signs and symptoms that indicate SFTSV infection, but surely after reviewing the manifestations of these patients, a more helpful conclusion about the possible manifestations of SFTSV infection in hospitalized patients can be achieved. This would be a useful contribution for clinicians who might suspect, test, report SFTSV infection and assess SFTSV infection in future cases. In the clinical assessment of any case of SFTS, findings relating to prognosis, including hypoalbuminemia, prolonged APTT, hyponatremia and presence of neurological manifestations, DIC and ALI/ARDS, need to be taken into account by clinicians.
