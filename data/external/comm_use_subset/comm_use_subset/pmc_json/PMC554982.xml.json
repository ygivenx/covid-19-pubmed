            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous beta-herpesvirus that affects 60\u201380% of the human population [1]. The lytic replication cycle of HCMV is a temporally regulated cascade of events that is initiated when the virus binds to host cell receptors. Upon entry into the cell, the viral DNA translocates to the nucleus, where expression of viral immediate early (IE), early and late genes occurs in a stepwise fashion [2]. While generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, primary HCMV infection may cause infectious mononucleosis and has been associated with atherosclerosis and coronary restenosis [3,4]. Furthermore, HCMV is the leading contributor of congenital viral infections in the United States and Europe, causing cytomegalic inclusion disease, pneumonia and severe neurological anomalies in infected neonates [5-7].",

Cellular immune responses (MHC class I-restricted T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells) appear to be an important factor in both the control of acute infections and the establishment and maintenance of viral latency in the host [9-14]; however, the mechanisms by which T-cells affect HCMV replication are currently undefined. While cytotoxic T-cell activity has been shown to correlate with recovery from HCMV infection in patients [15,16], recent studies suggest that immune cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferons (IFNs) may have direct inhibitory effects on HCMV replication [17,18]. In particular, the involvement of IFNs as a means of curtailing viral replication without cellular elimination is consistent with the hypothesis that cytokines produced by activated immune cells play a direct role in the control of viral infections [19-21].",

            "text": "Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) are important components of the host immune response to viral infections. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 are produced by most cells as a direct response to viral infection [22-24], while IFN-\u03b3 is synthesized almost exclusively by activated NK cells and activated T-cells in response to virus-infected cells [25]. Both types of IFNs achieve their antiviral effects by binding to their respective receptors (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 receptors), resulting in the activation of distinct but related Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathways. The result is the transcriptional activation of IFN target genes and the synthesis of a number of proteins that interfere with viral replication (reviewed in [26]). Although IFNs are effective inhibitors of viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus [26], almost all RNA and DNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert the host IFN response [21,26,27]. For example, HCMV inhibits IFN-stimulated antiviral and immunoregulatory responses at multiple steps [24,28-32]. Likewise, the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) protein ICP34.5 [33], the influenza A virus NS1 protein [34], the simian virus-5 V protein [35], the Sendai virus C protein [36], the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A and E2 proteins [37] and the Ebola virus VP35 protein [38] have all been shown to block IFN-mediated responses in infected cells. However, several studies have shown that viruses normally resistant to the effects of type I or type II IFNs separately, are susceptible to IFNs when used in combination. For example, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically inhibit the replication of HSV-1 both in vitro and in vivo [20]. In addition, recent reports have indicated that IFNs used in combination have a synergistic antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [39], HCV [40] and Lassa virus [41].",

Viral plaque formation was reduced by 9-, 37- or 29-fold in fibroblasts treated with 100 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3, respectively (Table 1). To test the effects of combination IFN-treatments on viral plaque formation, HFFs were pre-treated with 100 IU/ml each of (1) IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, (2) IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 or (3) IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. As expected, the level of inhibition achieved with both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 was not greater than the level of inhibition achieved by both IFNs separately. In contrast, pre-treatment with both type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2) and type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) reduced HCMV plaquing efficiency by 164- and 662-fold, respectively (Table 1). To eliminate the possibility that this effect was merely a result of doubling the total amount of IFNs per culture, we tested the inhibitory effects of 200 IU/ml of each IFN separately. Two-hundred IU/ml of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 reduced HCMV plaque formation by only 11-, 37- or 30-fold, respectively (Table 1). The level of inhibition was not significantly greater than the level of inhibition achieved by each IFN at concentrations of 100 IU/ml (P > 0.05), suggesting that the degree of inhibition observed can be attributed to the presence of two distinct types of IFNs.",

In contrast, combination IFN treatments achieved levels of inhibition 2\u201318 times greater than the sum of each individual IFN treatment. To determine if the enhanced inhibition of HCMV observed in HFFs treated with both type I and type II IFNs was synergistic, we employed the synergistic analysis for the determination of the interaction of two drugs [42,43]. Interaction indexes were initially calculated from the data generated in the dose response experiments (Figure 2A) to assess the synergistic potential of type I and type II IFN treatment. An interaction index of 0.05 \u00b1 0.03 for IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 combined and 0.04 \u00b1 0.01 for IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 combined indicated a high degree of synergy (Table 2). Additionally, synergy was confirmed by generating isobolograms in which concave isoboles are indicative of synergy while convex isoboles are indicative of an antagonistic effect (Figure 2B). Inhibitory concentrations were determined from dose response experiments, and IC95 isoboles were generated for HFFs treated with both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 2C, concave plot) and HFFs treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 2D, concave plot). Consistent with the interaction indexes determined (Table 2), concave isoboles shown in Figures 1C and 1D indicate a synergistic relationship between type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3), suggesting action via distinct antiviral pathways.",

In cultures treated with IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3, viral replication was undetectable or below the lower limit of detection at 1 and 2 days (d) post-infection (p.i.). At 3 d p.i., however, HCMV replicated to average titers of 8350, 1050 or 985 PFU/ml in IFN-\u03b1-, IFN-\u03b2- or IFN-\u03b3-treated cultures, respectively (Figure 3). While vehicle-treated cells replicated to average titers of 3.2 \u00d7 104 PFU/ml, viral titers recovered from cells treated with IFNs separately were reduced by 6-, 23- or 25-fold, respectively. Moreover, at 4 d p.i., viral titers in cells treated with IFNs separately were equal to viral titers recovered from vehicle-treated cultures. Consistent with our plaque reduction assays, we observed a similar enhanced inhibitory effect when HFFs were treated with a combination of type I and type II IFNs. In cultures treated with 100 IU/ml each of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, HCMV replication was detectable beginning at 3 d p.i. yielding titers at or below the lower limit of detection of the assay. Compared to HCMV titers of 1 \u00d7 105 PFU/ml at 4 d p.i. in vehicle-treated HFFs, treatment with IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 inhibited HCMV replication in HFFs by an average of 3125- or 5000-fold, respectively. When compared to ganciclovir (GCV)-treated cells, a known DNA synthesis inhibitor of HCMV, the level of inhibition achieved in GCV-treated cultures was comparable to that in IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3- or IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3-treated cultures at 3 and 4 d p.i.

To investigate the mechanism(s) by which IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically inhibit HCMV replication, we first examined the effect of IFNs on HCMV entry into HFFs. Cells were treated with vehicle or IFNs for 12 hours (h) prior to infection with HCMV. Two h after viral adsorption, DNA was isolated from the HCMV-infected cells and PCR was used to amplify a 373 bp fragment of the HCMV IE gene (Figure 4). For each treatment group, the PCR product yield increased as a function of viral multiplicity of infection (MOI). At all MOIs tested, the amount of PCR product amplified from HFFs treated with IFNs (Figure 4B\u2013F) was comparable to that of vehicle-treated HFFs (Figure 4A). Co-amplification of a GAPDH 239 bp PCR product served as an internal loading control for normalization of PCR product between treatment groups (data not shown). The amplification of similar levels of PCR products from HFFs suggests that the synergistic inhibitory effect of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 does not occur at the level of viral entry.",

Although limited studies have examined the effect of IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 treatment on HCMV IE mRNA expression, the conclusions of these studies are conflicting, most likely due to differences in both IFN and cell type [45,46]. To assess the effect of IFN treatment on IE gene expression, real-time PCR analyses of IE1 and IE2 mRNA levels in IFN-treated cells were performed. Figure 5 summarizes the fold-repression in IE1 and IE2 mRNA levels in IFN-treated cultures as compared to vehicle-treated controls. At 6 h p.i., IE mRNA levels in HFFs treated individually with either IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 were inhibited by < 2-fold, whereas in cells treated with both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, IE1 or IE2 mRNA expression was inhibited by 6- or 5-fold, respectively. A more enhanced inhibitory effect was observed in HFFs treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. In these cultures, IE1 or IE2 mRNA expression was repressed by 11- or 8-fold, respectively. Interestingly, the degree of IE mRNA inhibition observed in HFFs treated with IFN-\u03b2 alone was greater than that observed in cultures treated with IFN-\u03b1 alone, suggesting that type I IFN-mediated inhibition of IE mRNA expression is better facilitated by treatment with IFN-\u03b2 rather than IFN-\u03b1.",

To address this question, IE protein expression was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence over a 5-day period. For all treatment groups, IE protein expression was detected as early as 1 h p.i.; however, as viral replication progressed IE protein expression among IFN-treated groups varied (data not shown). Notably, by day 5 p.i., nearly 100% of the cells treated with vehicle, IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 alone stained positive for IE72/86, and approximately 87% of the cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 alone were expressing the IE proteins (Figure 6B\u20136E). In contrast, the percentage of cells expressing IE proteins was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) in the treatment groups that received combination IFNs, with only 46% of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3-treated HFFs and 21% of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3-treated HFFs positive for IE72/86 (Figure 6F, 6G). The observed differences suggest that in cells treated with both type I and type II IFNs, IE expression is (1) differentially regulated and/or (2) viral spread is severely hindered.",

            "text": "The immune response to viral infection is responsible for preventing viral dissemination and uncontrolled replication within the host. Following viral infection, type I IFNs are secreted by infected cells and function to induce an antiviral state in neighboring uninfected cells. Infiltrating immune cells, such as NK cells and macrophages, secrete numerous chemokines and cytokines that contribute to the overall antiviral response. Upon activation of the adaptive immune response, T-cells can further add to the milieu of immune cytokines present at the site of viral infection by secreting additional cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3. Although several studies have examined the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on HCMV replication in vitro, these studies are limited as they only examine the effect of one type of cytokine on viral replication rather than examining cytokines in combination. In support of the latter, recent studies have shown that type I and type II IFNs function, in synergy, to inhibit both RNA and DNA viruses, including HCV [41], SARS-CoV [39], Lassa virus [40] and HSV-1 [20]. These studies may more accurately represent the in vivo inflammatory response that results after viral infection. The results presented herein are consistent with this hypothesis and establish that type I (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and type II (IFN-\u03b3) IFNs synergistically inhibit the replication of HCMV.",

The inhibitory effect by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 was synergistic in nature (Table 2, Figure 2C, 2D) and the degree of inhibition was not matched by increasing the concentrations of each individual IFN (Table 1, Figure 2A). These results indicate that the observed IFN-induced antiviral effects are a direct result of the presence of two distinct types of IFNs. Moreover, inhibition of HCMV replication in cells treated with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 was observed in both HFF and embryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC5) (data not shown) infected with either Towne-GFP (see Methods) or another laboratory strain, AD169 (data not shown). The mechanism(s) by which HCMV replication is inhibited remains unclear. Type I and type II IFNs may synergize by acting on one or more different stages of the HCMV lytic cycle such as (1) viral attachment, (2) viral entry, (3) IE gene expression, (4) early gene expression, (5) DNA replication, (6) late gene expression, (7) virus assembly or (8) viral egress and maturation. To address the question of attachment and entry, PCR was used to amplify viral DNA from IFN-treated and vehicle-treated cultures shortly after infection. As previously observed [20,46], IFN treatment did not prevent viral entry into cells as indicated by equal PCR product yield from all treatment groups (Figure 4). These data indicate that IFNs exert their inhibitory effects at a step after viral attachment and entry.",

            "text": "Previously, Yamamoto, et al. (1987) demonstrated that treatment of cells with both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 potently inhibits HCMV replication; however, this study neither determined whether the effect was synergistic nor identified the mechanism of inhibition. However, the authors suggested that IFN-mediated inhibition of HCMV might occur at or prior to early gene expression [48]. Similarly, over the course of our experiments utilizing the Towne-GFP strain, it was noticed that very few cells expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) when treated with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 together (data not shown). In this recombinant Towne strain, GFP expression is driven by the early promoter UL127. The lack of GFP-positive cells in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3-treated groups suggested to us that the synergistic antiviral activities mediated by type I and type II IFNs occurred at a stage prior to early gene expression. Previous, studies have shown that type I or type II IFN treatment can inhibit HCMV IE mRNA expression [46] and/or HCMV IE protein expression [45,46]. Using real-time PCR, we showed that while IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 treatment inhibited IE mRNA expression by 2\u20136 fold at 6 h p.i., combination IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 treatment inhibited IE mRNA expression by 6\u201311 fold. Of note, this inhibitory effect was abolished by 24 h p.i. (data not shown), suggesting that IE mRNA expression is delayed by IFN treatment. The observed decrease in viral IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as viral IE protein expression was reduced in HFFs treated with both type I and type II IFNs (Figure 6A). Furthermore, immunofluorescent microscopy of IE protein expression revealed that nearly 100% of vehicle- and individual IFN-treated cells expressed IE72/86 5 d p.i., as compared to 46% or 21% of cells treated with IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, respectively (Figure 6B\u20136G). It appears that although individual IFN treatment results in a marginal inhibition in IE expression early in infection, the effect is not maintained as demonstrated by high viral titers at 4 d p.i. (Figure 3) and increased IE protein expression at 5 d p.i. (Figure 6A\u20136E). Additionally, HCMV cytopathic effect, characterized by enlarged cells containing intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, increased over time in vehicle- and individual IFN-treated groups, while morphology was unchanged in cells treated with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that the synergistic inhibition of HCMV replication by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 may involve, at least in part, the regulation of IE gene expression. The significance of an inhibitory block at this level is evident when the phenotype of IE1 mutant viruses is considered. Greaves and colleagues have demonstrated that HCMV IE1 mutants exhibit a diminished replication efficiency and a reduced ability to form plaques, as well as defective early gene expression [47,49,50]. Interestingly, in the presence of both type I and type II IFNs, HCMV shows similar replication and gene expression defects. Although our data suggest that IE gene regulation contributes to the synergistic inhibition of HCMV replication by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, other mechanisms may also affect this dramatic response. Accordingly, the decrease in IE protein levels exceeds that in IE mRNA levels in response to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, suggesting that additional regulation at the level of translation, post-translational processing and/or protein stability may be involved. Delineating the other putative regulatory mechanisms that contribute to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistic inhibition of HCMV replication is the focus of ongoing studies.",

In particular, IFN-\u03b2 stimulation induces twice as many genes as compared to IFN-\u03b1. This differential regulation of IFN-induced genes may explain in part the fact that the level of inhibition observed in HFFs treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 was consistently greater than that observed in cells treated with both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, although both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 bind to the same receptor. Similarly, when compared individually, IFN-\u03b2 consistently inhibited HCMV replication and IE gene expression to levels greater than IFN-\u03b1. Therefore, to better understand the cellular factors involved in the synergistic inhibition of HCMV, the profile of IFN-stimulated genes present in cells treated with both type I and type II IFNs should be further examined.",

Isobolograms were also generated to geometrically assess the degree of antiviral interaction between type I and type II IFNs, as previously described [43].
