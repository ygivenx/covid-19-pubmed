In this sense, Mhf seems to be the most pathogenic of the three main feline hemoplasmas. The clinical presentation can vary depending not only on the pathogenicity of the haemoplasma species, but also on host factors, such as the presence of concurrent disease. Younger cats are more susceptible to clinical haemoplasmosis [19]. Other factors such as infecting organisms\u2019 dose or route of infection may also impact on outcome [1].",

The overall prevalence of hemoplasma infection in cats in the Madrid area determined in the current study (10.6%; 63/594) is comparable to the results of a previous study carried out in Barcelona, Spain [20], where 12% of a population of 191 cats with and without outdoor access was analysed. This hemotropic mycoplasma prevalence is also similar to those described in other studies performed in Denmark [23], Germany [24, 25], Italy [26] and Switzerland [10] and lower than the rates reported by others in Greece [27], Italy [28, 29] and Portugal [6, 30]. These differences in prevalence can be due to several factors: the cat population sampled (which could present several risk factors simultaneously), geographical variations and/or differences in the diagnostic technique used in these studies (from microscopic to molecular detection among others). Our study was performed employing conventional PCR that has been highly employed previously and with good sensitivity, but it should be considered that a higher sensitivity could be achieved with a combination of real-time and conventional PCR analyses [5, 31, 32].",

This seasonal influence on prevalence has been previously described when comparing summer with autumn in one study performed in Italy [28], suggesting vector transmission. However, it has not been proven for natural infection and other studies have not found any association between prevalence rate and season of the year [6, 28, 33, 34]. In fact, in the client-owned cat group of this study, history of previous ectoparasites infestation (ticks/fleas) was not found associated with hemoplasma infection, similarly to previous descriptions [6, 33]. However, this information must be carefully assessed considering the natural behaviour of grooming in the cat, that could have facilitated the fact that arthropod infestation went unnoticed for the owner/person in charge of the cat [28]. In addition, other means of transmission must exist, considering their detection in areas where there is absence of the possible vectors [1]. In this sense, it has been described that male cats are more likely to engage in roaming and fighting behaviour, which may increase their chance of contracting the disease if a direct mode of transmission exists [7, 11, 20, 26, 33, 35\u201341]. Our own study supports a higher risk for male animals and for stray cats or client-owned cats that had outdoor access. All these factors may favour contact with other cats, although it should be considered that stray or client-owned cats with outdoor access are supposed to be more exposed not only to contact with other cats, but also to ectoparasites. In addition, it is important to consider the results of the logistic regression study carried out, that showed a stronger relationship of mycoplasma infection with the variable FIV status, which could mean that gender variable could be a confounding factor due to the relationship between positive FIV status and male sex.",

In our study, being an adult cat (> one year-old) was statistically associated with hemoplasma infection. This association could be explained because older animals have been more exposed to blood-sucking arthropods and to more aggressive interactions with other cats.

Concurrent diseases or previous infections, hemoplasma species involved (CMhm, Mhf, CMt or even co-infections), and the stage (acuteness or chronicity) of hemoplasma infection could considerably change these findings. While the most frequently described clinical signs in cats with hemoplasmosis are related to the occurrence of anaemia, lethargy, or pale mucous membranes [1] among others, the current study showed statistical associations between the infection by CMhm and musculoskeletal and renal signs. These results should be interpreted with caution, considering that other diseases could be responsible for the clinical signs detected in the cats in the current study, as it was observed in the cat co-infected with FIP, CMhm and Mhf, that showed musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal signs. Sykes et al. [41] suggested a relation between renal signs and hemoplasma infection, but also considered that the infected population represented by old cats probably has a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease.",

This and other studies [27] have detected hemoplasma infection both in cats suffering anaemia and in cats with red blood cells counts within reference values. Mhf is considered the most pathogenic feline hemoplasma species, causing extravascular erythrophagocytosis especially during the acute phase. However, an interesting finding to highlight is the association between the existence of anaemia not only in Mhf, but also in CMhm infected cats. It has been previously described that experimental CMhm infection generally does not induce anaemia and significant clinical signs, so geographical differences in the pathogenicity of the strain of this species should be considered. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the cats of the study could have been exposed to other pathogens previously described in central Spain [43, 44] or could be affected by other diseases associated with the development of anaemia.",
