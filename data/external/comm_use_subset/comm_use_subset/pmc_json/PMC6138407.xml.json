Commercial losses are mainly due to decreased weight gain and egg production, and a poor egg quality [1]. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the causative agent of IB, belongs to the genus gamma coronavirus, and the order Nidovirales [2]. In addition to causing respiratory disease and reproductive system defects in chickens, some nephropathogenic IBV strains also affect the renal system and cause nephritis [3]. Infection with IBV is complicated when an opportunistic pathogen like E. coli is present [4].",

However, limitations of live attenuated IBV vaccines include; reversion to virulence, tissue damage which can lead to secondary bacterial infections. In addition, the potential interference of maternal antibody on vaccine efficacy should also be taken into consideration [5]. Moreover, there is a possibility of recombination between virulent strains and vaccine strains, which may lead to the development of new pathogenic variants of IBV [6\u20138]. On the other hand, inactivated vaccines require priming with live attenuated vaccines, large doses of adjuvants, multiple vaccinations due to the shorter duration of the immune responses [9, 10]. These elevate the costs of vaccine production and limit its application [11]. Although DNA vaccines offer a novel method of immunization and can induce a cytotoxic T cell response, the low efficiency of these vaccines limit their application in the field [12]. Synthetic peptide vaccines alone are not immunogenic enough and require co-administration of adjuvants [13]. Therefore, there is demand for safe and more effective vaccines to control IB.",

            "text": "Lately, there has been an increasing interest directed towards the use of nanoparticles as vaccines against infectious pathogens [14\u201321]. These vaccines mimic various properties of viral pathogens, including size, and molecular configuration and the ability to induce both cellular and humoral immunity [22]. Our Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticles (SAPNs) represent a novel vaccine platform composed of protein monomers that are capable of self-assembling into structures that mimic the size and shape of small viruses [14,16,18,19,21]. In recent years, we demonstrated the potential of SAPNs as a platform for vaccines, and successfully developed potent vaccine prototypes for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [15], HIV [18], toxoplasmosis [19, 23], malaria[17,24] and influenza [16, 21]. SAPNs have many advantages in vaccine delivery over traditional methods. They can repetitively display epitopes on their surface when they are genetically fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the protein chain. Most importantly, the presentation is conformation-specific [14, 16, 21]. The sequence of antigens can be rapidly modified on response to the particular circulating pathogen and manufacturing can easily be scaled-up. Additionally, the incorporation of immunostimulatory molecule flagellin, a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), into the SAPN can generate a self-adjuvanted nanoparticle vaccine [21, 25].",

IBV has a positive, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA genome 27 kb in length, coding for four structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein (S), the membrane protein (M), the envelope protein (E) and the nucleocapsid protein (N) [26]. The spike protein plays an essential role in attachment, virus-cell membrane fusion and host specificity during IBV infection. The IBV spike protein is a class I fusion protein which is characterized by formation of an \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure [27]. It consists of the two subunits S1 and S2, which are in the outer membrane and anchored in the viral membrane. The S1 subunit is hypervariable whereas the S2 subunit is relatively conserved [28]. S1 induces neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies, which lack cross-protective capacity amongst different strains [29] The S2 subunit contains two heptad repeat areas that contribute to the fusion process [30]. Because the S proteins on IBV are the most significant antigenic elements to induce neutralizing antibody, vaccine studies have focused on this protein [31\u201333].",

However, a challenge remains because currently available live attenuated or killed vaccines are not effective to combat rapidly emerging variant strains generated from point mutation or recombination events. In addition, live attenuated vaccines are still the predominant vaccines in use, and their use raises the concern of safety [36, 37] as they contribute to the emergence of new pathogenic IBV variants [6]. In a study of live vaccine efficacy, about 10% of the chickens did not show any immune response when exposed to IBV even when raised in the same environmental conditions [38]. These differences are dependent on chicken genetics and are highly variable [39]. Killed vaccines are another currently commercialized option for IBV protection. These vaccines do not appear to elicit much protection for the respiratory tract as less than 59% of chickens in a study displayed tracheal immunity [1]. Peptide subunit vaccines may be safer, but are usually poorly immunogenic when used alone [13]. Nanoparticle technologies have been demonstrated as a promising delivery system to improve drug efficacy. Nevertheless, there are still some issues challenging the development of nanoparticles as vaccine delivery systems. On one hand, cytotoxicity of some nanoparticles like titanium oxide, gold, or cationic lipids [40\u201343] is a major problem. On the other hand, maintaining antigen stability and correctly displaying antigens in their native conformation on the surfaces of some nanoparticles may be challenging [44].",

Therefore, this otherwise unrelated malaria protein included into the design of the IB vaccines is beneficial. This vaccine also contains the bioactive domains of flagellin to self-adjuvant the vaccine and renders it more immunogenic. We successfully applied this system for influenza, malaria and toxoplasmosis, achieving a significant improvement on the immunogenicity as tested in terms of antibody response against these diseases [16, 21, 23, 25].

            "text": "Spike protein subunits of different viruses have been used in vaccination studies with success. Newcastle disease virus, for instance, has been modified to express the S subunit and was found to provide protection comparable to commercial vaccines after two vaccinations ([45]. Similar observations have been found using baculovirus [46]and fowl adenovirus [47]vectors. The IBV coronavirus S protein is considered the main virus attachment protein containing critical neutralizing epitopes, thus making it ideal as a vaccine component to induce protection against coronaviruses [29, 48, 49]. Indeed, several studies suggested that the S protein could serve as major target for vaccine design against coronaviruses [33, 50\u201354]. The S2 protein subunit, which is expressed on the surface of IBV, is a promising immunogen and can provide increased cross-protection against various serotypes [55, 56] since it is a highly conserved region [57]. The HR region of coronavirus S2 protein is an \u03b1-helical trimeric coiled-coil [58]. Therefore, a vaccine that displays HR in its native trimeric coiled-coil conformation would perform well in chicken. Our previous research showed that a SAPN that repetitively displays a SARS coronavirus B-cell epitope from the C-terminal HR of the virus\u2019 spike protein was able to neutralize SARS-coronavirus infectivity [15]. Based on homologies between the SARS-coronavirus and IBV S proteins we hypothesized that the equivalent region of IBV S2 would have similar vaccine potential. In the present study, SAPNs that repetitively display HR2 of IBV S2 protein induced noticeably high level of antibody responses. This initial result demonstrated that the prototype of our IBV-Flagellin-SAPN nanoparticle vaccine was able to induce strong humoral immune responses in vaccinated chickens. Repetitive display of B cells epitopes is essential to enhance humoral immune responses [2, 59]. The results of our study support that appropriate HR2 epitopes were repetitively displayed likely in their native trimeric conformation by the SAPN vaccines as evidenced by the relatively strong antibody response elicited in chickens. Furthermore, our IBV-Flagellin-SAPN vaccine significantly stimulated cellular immunity and generated a memory pool as demonstrated by the response of PBMCs from vaccinated chickens to recall antigen stimulation.",

Also the viral RNA loads in tracheas were significantly lower as compared to control groups four days after challenge. This was consistent with significantly lesser tracheal lesion scores four days after challenge in chickens vaccinated with IBV-Flagellin-SAPN than Flagellin- SAPN and buffer groups. Microscopic evaluation revealed that, there were no major pathologic changes in the tracheas of IBV-Flagellin SAPN vaccinated chicken and the histology was comparable to that non-vaccinated/non-challenged control group. This is a clear indication of vaccine induced protection. Our results are consistent to those reported previously in chickens vaccinated with a recombinant S-ectodomain protein vaccine which elicited protection against IBV challenge and suggested that, S2 domain has a crucial role in persuading protective immunity (Eldemery et al., 2017)",

However, it has to be kept in mind that this is an experimental vaccine and no previous data exist with the use of the same platform with this particular IBV antigen as to make comparisons. Therefore, this work conducted here provides proof of principle where vaccine immunogenicity was demonstrated as shown by measurable antibody and cellular responses and a level of protection were clearly demonstrated in vaccinated chickens.",

Flagellin has been extensively explored for the use as an adjuvant in various kinds of vaccine formulations, including soluble mixture with proteins, co-expressed with epitopes or encoded in DNA vaccines [60\u201362]. It is interesting that the Flagellin-SAPN is able to significantly reduce viral shedding in trachea of inoculated chickens after challenge with IBV (Fig 4). Chickens inoculated with Flagellin-SAPN also had significantly lesser lesion scores in tracheal tissues than chickens inoculated with buffer (Fig 5E). The protective effect of Flagellin-SAPN may be attributed to the non-specific activation of natural killer cells and macrophages, and to the recruitment of heterophiles, which lead to the limited and restricted virus replication. These observations are in accordance with the fact that flagellin can induce pro-inflammatory cytokines accounting for an antiviral effect. These data support an intrinsic quality of the vaccine backbone which is a significant asset. The level of protection with the IBV-Flagellin-SAPN vaccine was still significantly higher than that of Flagellin-SAPN based on both parameters. These data suggested that we have successfully implemented a self-adjuvanted SAPN for the use as a vaccine backbone against IBV.",
