These enveloped filamentous, negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses belong to the family Filoviridae. The African EBOV species, including Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Cote d\u2019Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) have been associated with disease of varying morbidity and mortality in humans. So far ZEBOV has had the highest case fatality rate ranging from 60 to 90% [1]. The only EBOV species found outside of Africa is Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) [2]. Though REBOV can infect humans, it has never been associated with clinical disease in people [1]. However, it can cause disease and mortality in cynomolgus macaques [3].",

            "text": "Until recently, NHPs were considered the only animal species susceptible to REBOV. In 2008, REBOV was detected in pigs co-infected with porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) in the Philippines. Antibodies to REBOV were also detected in humans that had been in close contact with the infected pigs, suggesting pig to human transmission [4]. Since these pigs were co-infected with PRRSV, it was not clear whether the observed clinical signs were due to REBOV or the co infecting virus. Subsequent experimental challenge suggested that REBOV infection in pigs may be asymptomatic despite replication of the virus in the lungs and shedding in nasopharyngeal secretions [5]. Nevertheless, the emergence of REBOV in pigs had prompted our group to investigate whether the African EBOV species could also infect pigs [6]. Using experimental challenge with the highly pathogenic ZEBOV, we observed clinical disease in pigs in the form of fever, severe respiratory distress characterized by rapid abdominal breathing; inappetence and lethargy [6]. In addition, the infected pigs could transmit virus to contact animals. Gross pathological lesions included pulmonary consolidation, enlarged and sometimes haemorrhagic lung associated lymph nodes. Histopathology lesions consisted of alveolitis characterized by haemorrhage, presence of fibrin, neutrophils and macrophages in alveoli as well as inflammatory cells in thickened alveolar walls. Viral antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and in inflammatory exudates in trachea. Apparently, experimental ZEBOV and REBOV in pigs seem to target the respiratory system but only the former induces overt clinical disease [5], [6].",

Cellular changes included the infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes into alveoli, with macrophages being the only leukocyte subset in the lungs that stained positive for ZEBOV. The aim of the current report was to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the cellular infiltration into the lungs, by using a porcine microarray to analyze changes in mRNA transcription for a range of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins in porcine lungs. In addition, we aimed to characterize the cellular infiltrates into the lungs using cell type-specific surface markers, also permitting the definitive identification of the cells harbouring ZEBOV antigen. Furthermore, we attempted to evaluated changes in PBMC subsets and serum cytokines.",

These pigs were negative for PRRSV and porcine circovirus -2 (PCV-2). Six pigs were given inhalation anaesthesia and then inoculated with 106 PFU of ZEBOV in sterile PBS per pig via the intranasal, intraocular and oral routes [6]. Two control pigs were mock inoculated with PBS and housed separately. Two ZEBOV-infected pigs were euthanized at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (DPI) respectively and tissues collected.

Quality of samples was analyzed in R Version 2.10.0 using the ArrayQualityMetrics package version 2.4.3 and data imported into GeneSpring GX version 11.0.1 (Agilent) for further analysis. Data was transformed to log base 2 prior to statistical analysis. First, an expression filter was applied such that probes with at least 1 out of 16 samples having values between 20 and 100 percentile in the raw data were retained for further analysis. One-way ANOVA was performed among the groups and Benjamini and Hochberg FDR method was used for multiple testing correction. Data with corrected p<0.05 and any pair (infected lungs vs control) with fold changes > 2 were considered significant. The complete data set is found in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database in NCBI under series record GSE44565.",

Approximately 80% of the inflammatory cells in the lungs showed positive immunostaining using Clone Mac387 macrophage and neutrophil marker (Figure 1B) and could be identified as primarily neutrophils with slightly lesser numbers of macrophages based on morphology (Figure 1C). Viral antigen was detected extensively in alveolar and septal macrophages using double immunostaining (Fig. 1D). A previously unreported feature was the presence of numerous multinucleated cells within alveoli which show positive immunostaining for Ebola virus antigen using IHC (Fig. 1E). Viral antigen was widely distributed, often observed in a peribronchiolar pattern and could be detected within inflammatory cells, type II pneumocytes, endothelial cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Immunostaining for CD3 showed that the presence of T lymphocytes was limited to bronchiolar submucosa and peribronchiolar areas and represented only a small proportion of the inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs (Figure 1F).

However, to the best of our knowledge, the presence of multinucleated cells within alveoli in the current report is a first in EBOV infection of any species. These cells could have possibly been in the lungs prior to ZEBOV infection since these pigs were not specific pathogen free. Nevertheless, the fact that the cells were positive for ZEBOV antigen would suggest that these giant cells could be a consequence of ZEBOV infection. Similar giant cells believed to be of macrophage lineage, were present in human lungs in fatal cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome but absent in ante-mortem samples [15], [16].

            "text": "We have revealed the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in lungs of ZEBOV-infected pigs. A network of cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins possibly interacted in the lungs of these pigs culminating in severe inflammation as suggested in our model in Figure 2. This inflammatory process possibly occurred in a cyclical fashion, with an initial induction of cytokines in resident alveolar cells, followed by the attraction of more cells into the lungs and then further amplification of the inflammatory process. For example, human neutrophils exposed to EBOV in vitro, though not infected, rapidly activate triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) [17] which results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that in turn attract more cells to the site via induction of vasodilation and increased vascular permeability [14]. Specifically, IL-8 is a strong attractant for neutrophils [18] while IL-5 is known to recruit and activate eosinopils at sites of inflammation [19]. Meanwhile, IL-22 activates IL-6 secretion and both cytokines are potent inducers of acute phase proteins which are also chemoattractants for inflammatory cells [20], [21]. In addition, alveolar macrophage-derived chemotactic factor (AMCF-II) acts as a chemoactractant for neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils to the lungs [18], [22]. Other chemokines and chemokine ligands, most of which are induced by proinflammatory cytokines, also act as chemoattractants for these cells [23]. Furthermore, selectins enable cell adhesion and extravasation, thereby facilitating cell migration to sites of inflammation [24]. Moreover, the high and rapid upregulation of palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated (PLUNC) gene, a marker of airway inflammation [25], conforms to the degree of inflammation observed in the lungs of ZEBOV-infected pigs. In addition, the increase in transcripts of markers (CD14 and CD163) and PRRs expressed on macrophages appears to correlate with the increased presence of these cells within the lungs. Similar proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses leading to infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages and other leukocytes into the lungs were linked to respiratory distress in pigs infected with highly pathogenic PRRSV [26], hence the clinical picture observed in pigs co-infected with PRRSV and REBOV in the Philippines in 2008 [4].",

However, a major difference between ZEBOV in pigs and humans/NHPs is the site of the cytokine response. In pigs the response is more localized in the lungs with very mild systemic involvement while in humans/NHPs it is predominantly systemic. In addition, the high induction of tissue specific chemoactractants such as PLUNC [25] and AMCF-II [22] seems to further favour a severe pulmonary involvement in pigs. Nevertheless, difficult and rapid breathing have been observed in ZEBOV-infected human patients but were associated to underlying metabolic defects rather than pulmonary pathology [29], [30]. Furthermore, a chimpanzee naturally infected with CIEBOV had no gross pathological lesions and only few antigen positive alveolar macrophages in the lungs [31]. However, when rhesus monkeys were aerosol exposed to ZEBOV, they developed what was described as a bronchocentric pattern of interstitial pneumonia. Additionally, there was an increase in number of leukocytes including antigen-positive alveolar macrophages [32]. However, as opposed to what we have observed in pigs, the leukocytosis in monkeys was diffuse [32]. Indeed, we also noticed that although alveolar macrophages were the only leukocyte subset positive for ZEBOV in both NHPs and pigs, there was a significant difference between the 2 species in the type and numbers of cells infiltrating the lungs [33]. Macrophages were the main cells in NHP lungs as opposed to pigs that had a high density of both macrophages and neutrophils in their lungs. The underlying mechanisms for these differences are the subject of further investigation. Differences in type and range of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced in the lungs might be a factor. Note that NHPs challenged with EBOV by both parenteral or aerosol routes develop systemic disease involving numerous organs [32]. This is clearly different in pigs in which induction of proinflammatory molecules and disease is mainly in the lungs, with less pronounced systemic involvement.",

The mechanism for this depletion is not entirely clear. As in human/NHP, the direct infection of monocytes by EBOV could lead to cell death [34], [35]. Similar to the reports in humans/NHPs, porcine B and T lymphocytes are not infected by ZEBOV. The apparent decline in B cells and no effect on T cells in peripheral blood of infected swine is contrary to observations in humans/NHPs. Depletion of T cells and not B cells as a consequence of bystander apoptosis is seen in human/NHPs [1]. The B cell depletion in infected pigs might also be due to bystander apoptosis; however additional mechanisms such as migration into spleen and lymph nodes could be involved.",
