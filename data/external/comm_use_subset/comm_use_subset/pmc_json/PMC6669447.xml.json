Likewise, aquatic animal viruses can also infect and cause disease in a wide range of aquatic animals [3,4]. Specifically, the interspecies infection was reported following ranavirus infection [5,6]. However, the basis for the broad ranavirus host range is not clear [7,8]. Ranaviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses within the family Iridoviridae [9]. Ranaviruses target aquatic animals globally and have been isolated from reptiles [10,11], amphibians [12,13,14,15], and bony fish [16,17]. Among them, several isolates represent great threats to the development of the aquaculture industry and wild animal populations [18]. Aside from infecting several species within a given taxonomic class (e.g., frog virus 3 infects diverse amphibian species), ranaviruses may also infect members of different classes (e.g., frog virus 3-like agents have been isolated from both amphibians and fish) [19].",

The complete genomes of the two viruses have been sequenced, and several functional proteins have been characterized [38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45]. For example, RGV-53R, a homolog of ADRV-58L, was identified as an envelope protein [38]. Decreased expression of RGV-53R, or its frog virus 3 (FV3) homolog FV3-53R impaired virus replication in cultured cells [45,46]. In this report, we examine the role of HS in ranavirus entry. Furthermore, since ranavirus viral envelope proteins [38,39,40,45,46,47,48] are likely involved in the initial interaction between virus and host, we examined the ability of RGV-53R and its ADRV homolog, ADVR-58L, to bind heparin-Sepharose beads.",

Both purified virions, isolated following separation on a sucrose step gradient, and a crude viral suspension, obtained by lysis of cells infected by the virus, were used in these assays. GSTC cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h prior to infection. Heparin was diluted in medium and mixed with the viral suspension or purified virions for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, and then 100 \u03bcL of the mixture containing approximately 1000 PFU of the indicated virus was added to cells for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C, as described above. The inoculum was removed after incubation. The cells, washed twice with fresh medium, were collected by centrifugation, and DNA was extracted with the TakaRa MiniBEST Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (TakaRa, Tokyo, Japan). Bound viral genomes, based on detection of the relative numbers of major capsid protein gene (MCP), were detected by qPCR, which was conducted using a StepOne Real-Time PCR system (The Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each qPCR mixture contained 1 \u03bcL of DNA, 12.5 \u03bcL of SYBR Premix (2\u00d7), 0.5 \u03bcL of forward and reversed primers (for each primer, 5\u2032-CACCTCCATCCCAGTCAGCA-3\u2032/5\u2032-AATCCCATCGAGCCGTTCA-3\u2032), and 10.5 \u03bcL of ultrapure water. The qPCR conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min; and a melt curve analysis at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 60 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 95 \u00b0C for 15 s. The \u03b2-actin gene, used in a previous study [52], was used as a loading control. qPCR efficiency was evaluated with a standard curve, based on serially diluted DNA samples using the \u03b2-actin gene primers, which showed that there were no obvious differences on the qPCR efficiencies among samples treated with different concentrations of heparin. For the MCP detection, MCP levels were normalized to \u03b2-actin levels in each sample. The level of bound virus (MCP level) in the treated group versus that in the control group (no heparin) was calculated by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method [53].",

            "text": "Considering the pivotal roles that viral envelope proteins play in virus attachment and entry, we determined whether viral envelope proteins interacted with HS by monitored the binding of purified recombinant proteins to heparin-Sepharose beads as described by Chung et al. [22]. Previous studies demonstrated that RGV-53R is 522 amino acid (aa) envelope protein with two predicted transmembrane (TM) domains (aa 193\u2013211 and aa 218\u2013237) [38]. ADRV-58L is the ADRV homolog of RGV-53R. The aa sequence identity between ADRV-58L and RGV-53R is 99.2% [13]. In the present assay, TM helices and topology of the two proteins were predicted with the online tools HMMTOP (http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/html/submit.html) and TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/) that presented on ExPASy. The primers 5\u2032-GTAGAATTCATGGGAGCAGCGGAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GATAAGCTTTTATGTGGTGGGGTCCAGGCC-3\u2032 were used for amplifying DNA sequences encoding the N-terminal region (1\u2013192) of 58L and the N-terminal region (1\u2013192) of 53R, respectively. The other pair of primers (5\u2032-GGCGAATTCCCCAGGCCCGTCAAGA-3\u2032/5\u2032-CTATAAGCTTTTAACCCCTGTGGGC-3\u2032) was used for amplifying the DNA sequences for the C-terminal region (238\u2013522) of 58L. Because the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal regions of ADRV-58L and RGV-53R are identical, only the C-terminal region of ADRV-58L was expressed in the present study. The resulting fragments were digested using EcoR I and Hind III, and ligated into pET32a or pET28a vectors that had been digested with the same enzymes. Successful cloning was validated by DNA sequencing.",

For ADRV, infectivity was reduced by approximately 70% by pre-exposure to heparin at 0.1 \u03bcg/mL and by more than 80% at 5 \u03bcg/mL. A similar phenomenon was observed in RGV-infected cells, which exhibited a 57% inhibition at 0.1 \u03bcg/mL and more than 75% at 5 \u03bcg/mL. Moreover, inhibition was detected regardless of the cell line used. The results indicate that heparin-like GAGs were involved in ADRV and RGV binding.",

Here we examine the role that viral envelope proteins play in this process by monitoring the interaction of purified recombinant viral envelope protein with heparin-Sepharose beads. To accomplish this, the amino terminal 192 amino acids of ADRV-58L and RGV-53R and the C-terminal region of ADRV-58L (amino acids 238\u2013522) were cloned into pET32a and pET28a and expressed in E. coli (Figure 5a). Because the amino acid sequences of the C-terminal regions of ADRV-58L and RGV-53R are identical, only the C-terminal region of ADRV-58L was expressed. Note the recombinant proteins were increased in size, due to a 17 kDa Trx-His-S tag in pET32a, and a 4 kDa His-T7 tag in pET28a. As shown in Figure 5b,c, recombinant proteins of the expected sizes were generated using the two expression systems. Subsequently, purified recombinant proteins were isolated and incubated with heparin-Sepharose beads or control beads lacking heparin. The three recombinant proteins (r58L-N, r53R-N, and r58L-C), expressed using either pET32a or pET28a, bound heparin-sepharose beads and were eluted in the presence of a high salt wash. In contrast, all three recombinant proteins failed to bind sepharose beads lacking heparin, and, as a result, were present in the unbound supernatant (S) fraction (Figure 5d). When considered together, these results support the view that HS is a cellular receptor for both ADRV and RGV and the binding fashion may be similar to the interaction between 53R/58L and heparin that occurred in vitro.",

Binding to cell surface GAGs, including HS, has proved to be the initial event in the entry of several mammalian viruses [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. Because GAGs are linked to proteins and usually exist as proteoglycans in vivo [26], viral envelope proteins may bind to cell surface heparan sulfate-linked proteins and facilitate attachment between the virus and potential host cells. Our results suggest that binding of cell surface HS is required for initiation of productive infection by ranaviruses. However, since competition by increasing concentrations of heparin or HS, or treatment with heparinase did not completely inhibit plaque formation, it appears that HS is not the sole cellular receptor for ranaviruses. A similar phenomenon has been observed in the binding of the vaccinia virus, which uses cell surface GAGs and cellular matrix laminin as receptors [22,23,24,25]. A recent study showed that class A scavenger receptors are utilized by frog virus 3, the type species of the genus Ranavirus [54]. Additional ranavirus binding factors and specific cellular protein receptors may be involved in viral attachment and entry. In addition, although the host range of ranaviruses could be determined by binding to other cellular proteins, binding to cell surface GAGs likely plays an important role in the initial interaction between virus and host cell.",

(a) Schematic diagram of the recombinant proteins: The N-terminal domain of ADRV-58L (r58L-N), the N-terminal domain of RGV-53R (r53R-N), and the C-terminal domain of ADRV-58L (r58L-C) were expressed using pET32a or pET28a. The predicted transmembrane region is shown in the grey box. (b) Expression and purification of the three proteins (r58L-N, r53R-N, and r58L-C) with pET32a vector. M: protein marker; 1, 4, 8: Bacteria without induction; 2, 5, 9: Bacteria with induction; 3, 6, 10: Purified proteins. The recombinant proteins are indicated with asterisks, and their predicted molecular weights are shown on the right. (c) Expression and purification of the three proteins using pET28a. M: Protein marker; 1, 5, 10: Cacteria without induction; 2, 6, 11: Cacteria with induction; 3, 4, 7, 8, 12: Purified proteins. The recombinant proteins are indicated with asterisks, and their predicted molecular weights are shown on the right. (d) Binding of recombinant proteins and heparin-Sepharose beads. Recombinant proteins were incubated with heparin-Sepharose or Sepharose beads. The fractions of input (Input), supernatant after incubation (S), the fifth wash solution (W5), and the eluate (Eluate) were detected by Western blot with the anti-His antibody. Recombinant proteins expressed with pET32a or pET28a vectors were used. Recombinant proteins were observed in the Input and Elute fractions from heparin-Sepharose beads and S fraction from control beads.",
