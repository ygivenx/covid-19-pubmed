            "text": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of the apicomplexan phylum, and it is capable of infecting a wide range of mammals, including humans (1). The life cycle includes multiple invasive forms (i.e., tachyzoites, bradyzoites, merozoite, and sporozoites), each of which successfully invades and replicates inside its host cell (2). The parasite avoids phagocytosis and instead actively invades its host cell and thereafter resides in a stable parasitophorous vacuole (PV), where it replicates (3, 4). The PV exhibits several notable features that help explain the survival of T. gondii within hostile cells such as macrophages. First, entry into human macrophages occurs without eliciting a classical respiratory burst (5). Second, the lumen of the vacuole fails to acidify, owing to an absence of delivery of proton pumps to the membrane (6). Third, the vacuole fails to fuse with lysosomes, thus protecting it from their hydrolytic contents (7). The molecular mechanism by which the PV avoids eliciting host cellular responses remains undefined but may stem from active invasion and the formation of the PV membrane by invagination of the plasma membrane (8) and extensive remodeling of its contents to mask identity (9, 10).",

            "text": "In North America and Europe, the population structure of T. gondii is dominated by three clonal lineages known as types I, II, and III (11). Although type I strains are highly studied due to their acute virulence in laboratory mice (12), they are not the major types found in natural infection. Rather, type II strains, which exhibit intermediate levels of virulence in laboratory mice, predominate among animal and human infections in North America and Europe (13\u201315). Type II strains exhibit intermediate virulence in mice and yet are capable of causing significant disease in humans (13\u201315). Type III strains are also common in animals, and yet they are extremely rare in humans (13\u201315), suggesting that they either do not cause infection or at least rarely cause disease. The major differences in mouse virulence among these strain types have been mapped to a polymorphic family of rhoptry kinases including ROP18 and ROP5 (16). These determinants have been shown to play a major role in combating host defense in gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3)-activated cells, where the acute virulence is attributed to their composite genotypes (17).",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b3 is the major resistance determinant that is required to control T. gondii infection in mice (18), and signaling evoked by this cytokine is essential in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells (19). At the cellular level, IFN-\u03b3 exerts its anti-Toxoplasma effect by upregulating a variety of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including those for immunity-related GTPases (IRGs), guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), nitric oxide, or autophagy-related clearance, which in turn either control growth or damage the parasite directly (20\u201323). IFN-\u03b3-induced Irgs disrupt and damage the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), leading to parasite killing in mouse macrophages, and this pathway is avoided by virulent type I strains (24, 25). Type I parasites employ ROP18 to phosphorylate Irgs and thus inhibit their recruitment to their vacuole, thereby preventing their damage and clearance in mouse macrophages (26, 27). However, type III parasites lack expression of ROP18 and therefore are rapidly cleared from IFN-\u03b3-activated macrophages, a defect that is restored by complementation with ROP18 (26, 27). Mouse GBPs are also known to target the PVM in IFN-\u03b3-activated cells (28), leading to degradation of the parasite (29). Deletion of the GBP cluster of chromosome 3 makes mice more susceptible to T. gondii infection (30), as does loss of Gbp1 (31) or Gbp2 (32). ROP18 has also been shown to participate in defense against Gbps (31), although the mechanism responsible for this activity is unknown.",

In addition, Gbp2 has been shown to function in activation of the AIM2-dependent inflammasome in response to Francisella novicida (34). Inflammasomes are cytosolic oligomeric protein complexes that often consist of Asc, caspase-1, and an NLR or ALR sensor protein formed in response to cellular danger or pathogen-associated signals. Upon activation, the inflammasome leads to autoproteolysis of procaspase-1 to proteolytically active caspase-1 that in turn cleaves cytosolic prointerleukin-1\u03b2 (pro-IL-1\u03b2) and pro-IL-18 to secretory IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, respectively. These cytokines then drive downstream signaling to promote antimicrobial function of macrophages and Th1 adaptive immune responses (35, 36). Inflammasome activation has been implicated in controlling T. gondii infection in vivo, where mice lacking NLRP1B (37) or NLRP3 or caspase-1 (38) are more susceptible to type II parasite infection.",

NADPH oxidases (Nox) are multimeric enzyme complexes that generate superoxide free radicals upon activation (40). Although the Nox complex is expressed in almost every mammalian tissue, its function of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in host defense against pathogens is more pronounced in phagocytes, where the Nox2 isoform predominates (41). Upon activation, gp91phox (Nox2) and p22phox subunits that reside in the plasma membrane recruit other cytosolic subunits of the complex (i.e., p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox) to convert NADPH to NADP+ and hence generate superoxide radicals (41). When activated, Nox rapidly generates elevated production of ROS (defined as respiratory burst) in response to pattern recognition receptors of invading pathogens (42). ROS production is dependent on expression of Nox1 and Nox2 isoforms in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) that cross-regulate differentiation profiles of macrophages (43). Mutation in genes involved in NADPH oxidase functioning or assembly causes chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in humans that typically results in frequent bacterial or fungal infections (44).",

We demonstrate that in naive macrophages with avirulent type III T. gondii, parasites induced Nox-dependent ROS production and Gbp5 expression. Both of these factors are involved in clearance of type III parasites from naive macrophages independent of prior activation with IFN-\u03b3 and independent of classical inflammasome activation that can be primed by LPS (33).

The cells were fixed at 30 min and 20 h postinfection, and the percentage of infected cells was calculated by automated plate-based imaging to acquire data from many independent microscopic fields (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The percentage of CTG-infected RAW 264.7 macrophages was significantly reduced by >50% at 20 h compared to 30 min postinfection, whereas the percentage of GT1-infected macrophages was unaffected (Fig. 1A). We observed a similar enhanced clearance of the CTG strain in naive bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), while GT1 survived significantly better (Fig. 1B). This finding is somewhat surprising, as T. gondii is generally regarded as a pathogen that survives in naive macrophages, owing to its ability to actively invade the host cell and avoid phagocytic responses (4).",

Hence, we considered that a similar pathway might be triggered in naive macrophages infected with CTG. However, ubiquitination of the vacuole membrane as detected by the antibody FK2, which recognizes mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins, and recruitment of the LC3 adapter p62 were very low on both parasite strains in naive BMDMs (Fig. 1D). Additionally, the autophagy-associated marker LAMP2 was not elevated on CTG-containing vacuoles in naive BMDMs (Fig. 1D).

As such, the kinetics of clearance differs substantially from previously characterized pathways. We also examined the morphology of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, as previous studies in IFN-\u03b3-activated cells have described a prominent scalloped appearance of the membrane, prior to rupture, in a process that is medicated by IRGs and GBPs (24, 26, 31, 46). A majority of parasitophorous vacuoles at early time points revealed normal cellular architecture of both the vacuole membrane and the parasite residing within (Fig. 2B). Over time, there was an accumulation of parasites that showed damage, including loss of the parasitophorous vacuole envelope (Fig. 2C), blebbing of parasite surface membranes (Fig. 2C), rupture of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane with the host cytosol filling the space (Fig. 2D), and swelling of internal parasite membranes such as the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2D).

Naive BMDMs lacking nitric oxide production (Nos2\u2212/\u2212), Irg-mediated defense (IrgM3\u2212/\u2212), or autophagy protein Atg5 (Atg5f/f LysMCre) failed to reverse the clearance of CTG strain parasites (Fig. 3). These findings indicate that nitric oxide production, Irg-mediated defenses, and Atg-related pathways are unlikely to explain the increased susceptibility of CTG in naive mouse macrophages. However, BMDMs lacking gp91 (Nox2\u2212/\u2212; NADPH oxidase) showed significant loss of CTG clearance compared to wild-type cells (Fig. 3). The rescue of CTG parasites in Nox2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages suggested that their clearance in naive macrophages is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction.",

Although invasion of human macrophages by T. gondii proceeds without a ROS burst (5), infection of mouse macrophages with T. gondii has been shown to produce early ROS (48). Therefore, we tested whether CTG versus GT1 infection resulted in elevated ROS production in naive macrophages using luminol-based chemiluminescence. As expected, neither CTG nor GT1 produced ROS as defined by classical respiratory burst in naive RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 4A) or BMDMs (Fig. S2). In contrast, incubation of macrophages with zymosan A (ZymA; 50 \u00b5g/ml), which acts as a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist, produced the expected ROS burst within a few minutes of incubation (Fig. 4A and S2). Treatment of macrophages with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI; 10 \u00b5M), which acts as an inhibitor of Nox assembly, abrogated the increase observed with ZymA treatment (Fig. 4A and S2), indicating that the observed ROS burst was Nox dependent. These results demonstrate that T. gondii does not trigger activation of the Nox complex in naive mouse macrophages during the initial stages of invasion.",

To confirm this model, we were interested in testing whether the reversal of CTG clearance in Nox2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages as shown in Fig. 3 was due to a decrease in ROS production. First, we established that ROS production upon CTG infection was also evident in wild-type BMDMs at 9 h postinfection and that it was reversed in NAC-pretreated macrophages (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the above-described model, ROS levels produced in CTG-infected Nox1\u2212/\u2212 and Nox2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages were significantly lower than what was observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 5B). This finding suggested that both Nox isoforms are involved in ROS production in BMDMs infected with CTG. Consistent with this finding, CTG infection was significantly rescued in NAC-pretreated wild-type macrophages (Fig. 5C). Moreover, clearance of CTG was also significantly decreased in both Nox1\u2212/\u2212 and Nox2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages compared to wild-type cells (Fig. 5C). Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that CTG infection of naive macrophages leads to increased intracellular ROS that depends on both Nox1 and Nox2 isoforms that contribute to parasite clearance.",

To examine this possibility, wild-type C57BL/6, Nox1\u2212/\u2212, and Nox2\u2212/\u2212 mice were challenged by intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection and monitored over time. Infection in Gr1+-F4/80+ cells, which represent inflammatory macrophages recruited during the early phase of infection (49), was monitored by flow cytometry. There was a significant increase of 3- to 7-fold in the percentage of CTG-infected Gr1+-F4/80+ cells in Nox1\u2212/\u2212 and Nox2\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild type (Fig. 5D), consistent with these mutants being less able to control early infection. In contrast, there was a higher percentage of GT1-infected Gr1+-F4/80+ cells, consistent with the intrinsic virulence of this strain (26), and this decreased only slightly in mutant mice compared to wild type, likely due to a higher influx of macrophages. The increased expansion of CTG in inflammatory macrophages from Nox-deficient mice at early time points also led to different outcomes of infection. Notably, Nox1\u2212/\u2212 and Nox2\u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly more susceptible than the wild-type mice to i.p. infection with CTG as shown by decreased survival (Fig. 5E).

As such, we sought other explanations for the enhanced susceptibility of CTG in naive macrophages. Induction of Gbp1 (31) and Gbp2 (32) during T. gondii infection is associated with their recruitment onto the PVM and parasite damage, albeit best characterized in IFN-\u03b3-activated macrophages. However, some Gbps, including Gbp3 and Gbp5, can be expressed in macrophages to a significant level independent of IFN-\u03b3 (32). Therefore, we tested whether any of these factors are induced upon T. gondii infection of macrophages independent of IFN-\u03b3. To our surprise, BMDMs infected with either CTG or GT1 showed significant increase in expression of Gbp2, Gbp5, and Gbp7 mRNA at 20 h postinfection compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 6A). In particular, Gbp5 mRNA increased up to ~40-fold upon T. gondii infection, whereas Gbp2 and Gbp7 mRNA showed an ~10-fold increase (Fig. 6A). Gbp5 protein levels were also increased upon CTG or GT1 infection of naive macrophages, although to a lesser extent than IFN-\u03b3 treatment in wild-type BMDMs (Fig. 6B). The specificity of the ~65-kDa band of Gbp5 was confirmed by its absence in cell lysates of Gbp5\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Fig. 6C).",

            "text": "Previous studies have implicated Gbp5 in promoting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and control of intracellular bacteria (33). ROS production has also been implicated in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation (50), although the NADPH oxidase complex is not required for inflammasome activation in response to strong agonists like nigericin or ATP (51). Therefore, we tested whether inflammasome activation occurs upon T. gondii infection of naive macrophages. Initially, we monitored IL-1\u03b2 transcripts and found that infection with T. gondii only slightly altered their levels, while treatment with LPS greatly increased mRNA levels (Fig. S3A). We then measured IL-1\u03b2 release to the supernatant as a marker of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. There was no significant increase in IL-1\u03b2 secretion of either CTG- or GT1-infected naive macrophages (Fig. S3B). In contrast, LPS-primed macrophages did show significant secretion of IL-1\u03b2 upon infection with either CTG or GT1 parasites by 20 h postinfection (Fig. S3B). Release of IL-1\u03b2 was dependent on both LPS pretreatment and infection, consistent with the two-step hypothesis for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (52). The increase was significantly reduced upon NAC pretreatment of wild-type macrophages or in Gbp5\u2212/\u2212 and Nox2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Fig. S3B). Caspase-1 activation and its release into the supernatant are another marker for inflammasome activation. However, we also did not observe activated caspase-1 (cleaved 20-kDa caspase-1 fragment) in the supernatant of CTG- or GT1-infected naive or LPS-primed macrophages (Fig. S4). As expected, treatment with nigericin was able to elicit caspase-1 release in LPS-activated macrophages, and this effect was partially abrogated in Gbp5\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Fig. S4). Collectively, these findings indicate that infection with T. gondii alone is not sufficient to induce inflammasome activation because priming signals are needed for IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression, but when combined with LPS, it provides a signal that drives IL-1\u03b2 release. Although this pathway is partially dependent on Gbp5 and ROS, it did not lead to cell death (Fig. S5).",

Despite evidence that Gbp5 contributes to clearance, we observed only modest evidence for its recruitment to parasitophorous vacuoles containing CTG (3.1% \u00b1 2.4% [mean \u00b1 standard deviation {SD}, n = 4] at 9 h postinfection) in naive macrophages (Fig. 6E).

Surprisingly, we found that highly avirulent type III strains are rapidly cleared in naive macrophages, even in the absence of interferon activation. Clearance was associated with gradual disruption of the PV and damage to the parasites in a process that did not involve lysosome fusion, recruitment of autophagy adapters, or vesiculation mechanisms that have been described previously. Additionally, there was no effect on parasite clearance in the absence of different host factors like Atg5, Nos2, or Irgs that are involved in IFN-\u03b3-mediated growth restriction and killing of T. gondii in murine macrophages. Instead, naive macrophages cleared avirulent type III T. gondii parasites via induction of cellular ROS. Disruption of the NADPH oxidase complex in Nox1- or Nox2-deficient cells partially reversed the clearance defect. Nox1- and Nox2-deficient mice were also more susceptible to infection, indicating that this mechanism partially accounts for avirulence of type III strains in vivo. In addition, infection of macrophages leads to upregulation of GBPs, and the clearance of type III parasites was partially reversed in Gbp5\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Although both NADPH oxidase and Gbp5 have previously been implicated in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, infected cells did not undergo caspase-1 cleavage or pyroptosis. These findings highlight new roles for the NAPH oxidase and GBPs in control of intracellular pathogens via pathways intrinsic to naive cells that do not require prior activation by interferons.",

            "text": "Invasion of T. gondii into macrophages results in formation of a parasitophorous vacuole that fails to acquire markers of endosomes and also does not fuse with lysosomes (45). This outcome can be modulated by adding antibody to opsonize the parasite for internalization via Fc receptors (3). Interestingly, the machinery to drive lysosome fusion is also found in nonphagocytic cells as shown by expression of Fc receptors, which is sufficient to drive opsonized T. gondii to lysosomes (53). The ability of T. gondii to avoid lysosome fusion was not responsible for the defect in type III strain survival and is likely universal to all strains. Additionally, we did not observe an increase in ubiquitination or recruitment of autophagy adapters that have been linked to control of intracellular bacterial by a process termed xenophagy (54\u201356). Instead, the PV formed normally but then underwent gradual disruption characterized by loss of integrity of the vacuolar membrane, damage to parasite membrane, and degradation of internal membrane structures. These features are very different from the scalloped appearance of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane that accompanies clearance in IFN-\u03b3-activated cells, a process linked to recruitment of Irgs (26). The recruitment of Irgs to the PVM is dependent on a noncanonical autophagy pathway and is disrupted in Atg5\u2212/\u2212 cells and other components of the core pathway (46, 57). Consistent with a lack of evidence for PVM vesiculation, the enhanced clearance of type III parasites was unaltered in Atg5\u2212/\u2212, IrgM3\u2212/\u2212, or Nos2\u2212/\u2212 cells. Although the precise reason for loss of type III parasites is uncertain, it may involve damage from ROS and/or transient association with Gbp5, as discussed below. Regardless of the precise mechanism of membrane damage, this outcome differs morphologically and kinetically from previously described pathways for clearance of T. gondii in macrophages.",

Reversal of CTG clearance in Nox1\u2212/\u2212 or Nox2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages suggests that the parasites are cleared by induction of NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS in naive macrophages. However, we did not observe a classical respiratory burst, which typically is evoked very rapidly and reaches high levels, as seen with zymosan stimulation. Rather, ROS production following T. gondii infection was muted in its extent and delayed, with maximum levels detected at ~9 h postinfection. It remains possible that the role described here for NADPH oxidase could also be due to mitochondrial production of ROS, since previous studies have shown that these pathways work cooperatively in host defense against intracellular bacteria (59). Regardless of the exact mechanism of ROS production, the role of NADPH oxidase was also seen in vivo where both Nox1\u2212/\u2212 and Nox2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed increased infection of inflammatory macrophages during early infection with CTG, leading to increased susceptibility compared with wild-type mice. The reason for the enhanced induction of ROS by type III strains is uncertain, but numerous genetic differences occur between type I and III strains, including the polymorphic T. gondii protein GRA7 (17, 60), which has been shown to elicit Nox2-dependent ROS in BMDMs (61). Prior studies have also suggested a role for NADPH oxidase during acute infection of mice with type I parasites that elicited ROS production by infected myeloid inflammatory cells during 3 to 4 days postinfection (62). Additionally, preexposure to ATP can increase ROS upon type I T. gondii infection of macrophages (63). Collectively, these findings suggest that ROS production can lead to control of T. gondii under certain circumstances. Our findings indicate that type III strains induce significantly higher levels of ROS and that this contributes to their clearance in naive macrophages.",

We therefore examined the expression of other innate effectors that have been implicated in control of T. gondii, including IRGs and GBPs (64). Expression of Gbp5 was strongly induced upon infection with T. gondii, while Gbp2 and Gbp7 were induced at lower levels, and no substantial change was seen in Gbp1 or Irga6. Gbp5 is normally expressed in unstimulated mouse macrophages, and like other GBPs, it is also induced by interferon treatment (32). Induction of GBPs upon T. gondii infection occurred independently of addition of interferon, although the basis for this increased expression is uncertain. Unlike Gbp1 and Gbp2, Gbp5 has not previously been associated with increased recruitment to T. gondii-containing vacuoles in interferon-activated cells (28). Consistent with this observation, Gbp5 was detected on only a minority of CTG-containing vacuoles (i.e., ~3%) in naive macrophages, albeit at higher levels than seen in GT1-infected cells. Despite its not being strongly recruited to the vacuole, loss of Gbp5 in the knockout led to the increased survival of CTG parasites in naive macrophages. Hence, it is possible that Gbp5 plays a role in parasite restriction that is independent of stable association with the parasite vacuole. A similar finding has previously been reported for GBP1 in human cells, where parasite control occurs independently of recruitment to the vacuole in A549 cells (65). Alternatively, it is possible that recruitment of Gbp5 to T. gondii-containing vacuoles is transient or that the demise of the compartment is sufficiently rapid that it does not remain stably associated with the membrane. Consistent with the idea that Gbp5 acts proximal to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, expression of ROP18 in the type III CTG strain reversed the enhanced clearance seen in naive macrophages. ROP18 has previously been shown to mediate resistance to Gbp1 in interferon-activated macrophages, and this protective effect is thought to occur at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (31). Similarly, expression of ROP18 in CTG parasites may block the action of Gbp5, or an associated factor, on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, thus protecting the parasite from damage. Distinguishing between these two mechanisms will require further study to define the molecular partners of Gbp5 and to ascertain whether ROP18 acts directly or indirectly to block this host effector.",

Our findings are only partially consistent with activation of the inflammasome pathway, which normally requires separate priming and activation steps (52).

However, infection with type I (GT1) or type III (CTG) strain parasites was able to induce IL-1\u03b2 release from LPS-treated cells, indicating that infection can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in cells that have previously been primed (52). However, we did not detect cleavage and release of caspase-1 or activation of pyroptosis in T. gondii-infected cells even following LPS priming, suggesting that infection with these strains does not result in classical inflammasome activation. Interestingly, in the present study both Nox2 and Gbp5 were required for optimal IL-1\u03b2 release in LPS-primed and infected cells, consistent with previous findings that these processes regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome (33, 50). Thus, one model to explain the roles for NADPH oxidase and Gbp5 in restricting survival of type III strains of T. gondii is that they collectively activate an inflammasome-like process, albeit not one that leads to cell death. This observation agrees with several previous studies that used type II strain parasites to infect BMDMs in vitro and found that IL-1\u03b2 gets secreted from primed cells without inducing pyroptosis (37, 38). Although engagement of the inflammasome complex does not appear to induce cell death in the murine system, it nonetheless has been shown to promote parasite control in vivo, an effect that may relate to processing of cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2 (37) and IL-18 (38). Thus, the enhanced susceptibility of type III strains in vivo may stem from both the increased susceptibility to clearance in naive macrophage and downstream mediators that influence immunity.",

IRGs (66, 67) and GBPs (64) are strongly induced following exposure to IFN-\u03b3, and they provide the major mechanism of resistance in the mouse following activation of the immune response. Collectively, the susceptibility of type III strains to clearance in naive cells, as reported here, and in IFN-\u03b3-activated cells, as reported previously, contributes to their profound avirulence in the murine system. Type II strains, which have intermediate virulence in mice, were not susceptible to clearance in naive cells (S. K. Matta, unpublished data), although we have not examined the consequence of loss of ROP18 in this genetic background. Type III strains may also be susceptible to ROS in human cells, although infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages with type I strains of T. gondii has been reported to not trigger a strong respiratory burst (5). Moreover, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients, who lack a functional PHOX oxidase complex, are not known to be more susceptible to toxoplasmosis (68), suggesting that there are other intrinsic mechanisms for control of this parasite in human cells. Defining the roles of various pathways in human cells, including the role of additional GBPs, in the control of T. gondii remains an important goal for future studies.",

Rather, type III strains are readily cleared from naive macrophages, a property that may underlie their avirulence in mice, and possibly the rarity of infections caused in humans. We have identified Nox-mediated ROS generation and Gbp5 as novel factors involved in regulating intracellular survival of avirulent type III parasites within macrophages. These factors may be linked by a common involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome, although restriction of parasite survival does not rely on activating pyroptosis. Together, these factors act independently of interferon activation, suggesting that they provide an autonomous system for cell-intrinsic control of intracellular infection.",
