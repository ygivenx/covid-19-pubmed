The atypical bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are common causes of pneumonia in children older than 5 years4. The identification of the causal agent is pivotal, especially in children who require hospital admission, as it guides the choice of appropriate treatment. However, the microbial diagnosis of CAP in children is not easy to establish without invasive procedures, which are only rarely performed in this age group2,5. Pneumonia can be a life-threatening disease if left untreated6. Initially, antibiotic therapy is empirical and influenced by epidemiological, clinical and radiographic findings. Slovenian guidelines recommend a penicillin-based antibiotic as a first-line therapy for non-complicated bacterial CAP in the paediatric population. Macrolide antibiotics should be used for the presumed atypical bacterial CAP7. Children with non-complicated viral CAP need only supportive treatment6.",

Although CXR is not considered a \u201cgold standard\u201d, it has a high negative predictive value for CAP in children11. However, CXR cannot reliably establish the microbial diagnosis of CAP2, and the interpretation of radiographic images varies significantly among the observers12. Nevertheless, there are some radiographic characteristics that are more often associated with the specific microbial aetiology of CAP. Alveolar infiltrate in the form of lobar, segmental or round consolidation is relatively specific for bacterial pneumonia but lacks sensitivity13. Viral pneumonia often presents with bilateral interstitial infiltrates on CXR14. A similar form of infiltrates can be observed in atypical bacterial CAP15. However, infection with M. pneumoniae often radiologically mimics classic bacterial CAP, presenting with alveolar infiltrate or even small pleural effusion6,16.",

The advantages of LUS are as follows: no ionizing radiation, lower cost, the possibility of follow-up examination, the ability to monitor the effect of therapy, and better patient cooperation21,22. Furthermore, this diagnostic technique is accessible, portable, fast, easy to learn, and can be used immediately as a point-of-care method. LUS has good diagnostic accuracy even when performed by non-experts18,20. By using LUS, it is possible to observe many pathological lung patterns associated with pneumonia, such as consolidation, pleural effusion, and interstitial syndrome. Consolidation, as seen on LUS, is hypoechoic or isoechoic, has a tissue-like structure and represents a loss of lung aeration. Branching, hyperechoic and dynamic air bronchograms detected within the area of consolidation, is the hallmark of pneumonia17,23.",

By analogy to the CXR characteristics of different types of CAP, we hypothesize that the aetiologically different types of CAP (bacterial, viral, atypical bacterial) differ in their LUS characteristics. More specifically, the consolidations in bacterial CAP are more likely to be solitary, larger and unilateral than those in the viral and atypical bacterial CAPs, where we expect to find multiple consolidations that are smaller and more often bilateral.",

The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 16 years. Initially we enrolled all (188) children who were hospitalized in the aforementioned period for CAP and had pneumonic consolidation(s) detected with LUS. LUS was performed in all patients with at least two of the following signs and symptoms: fever (>38 \u00b0C), cough, dyspnoea, abnormal auscultatory findings, chest or abdominal pain. LUS was also performed in children with a fever without a localizing signs and leucocytosis (>15 \u00d7 109/L). All the studied children were previously healthy and were not born premature. We excluded patients with immune deficiency, neurological impairment, chronic lung (except asthma) or heart disease or any other chronic condition that can predispose individuals to pneumonia. In addition, we excluded patients with severe CAP who required management in the paediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Some patients were excluded only after the completion of treatment, when alternative diagnoses were established or when we were unable to determine the aetiology of CAP. Final number of included patients for subsequent analysis was 147 (Fig. 1). We did not exclude patients who were already treated with antibiotics before admission. There were 12 (9.3%) such patients, 7 (8.2%) of whom were in the bacterial CAP group. The diagnosis of CAP was confirmed according to the British Thoracic Society (BTS) criteria at discharge from the hospital by two senior paediatric pulmonologists2.",

This algorithm did not differentiate between the different microbial aetiologies of pneumonia and was later further upgraded for the purpose of differentiating between the viral LRTI and bacterial superinfection in children during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In this study, a bacterial superinfection was considered in all patients in whom lung consolidation with an air bronchogram was detected using LUS. Small subpleural consolidations or confluent B-lines were considered as characteristics of viral pneumonia. Similarly, patients with an alveolar infiltrate on CXR were classified as having bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia was assumed when interstitial infiltrates were detected on CXR26. In this way, a high correlation between LUS and CXR was determined. However, the potential of CXR for the microbial diagnosis of CAP is limited2, as more than half of patients with interstitial infiltrates on CXR were supposed to have bacterial CAP13. Therefore, we have not considered CXR as the \u201cgold standard\u201d, nor have we focused on the comparison between LUS and CXR. Our patients were stratified mainly according to the microbiological results. We considered bacterial co-infection or superinfection only in those patients with proven viral infection who had alveolar infiltrates on CXR and leucocytosis and an increased serum PCT value as described in the Methods section and shown in Fig. 1.",

In this study, a correlation between the size of the LUS-detected pneumonic consolidation and the neutrophil count was observed, although they did not distinguish between the different aetiologies of CAP19. We confirmed a correlation between WBC count and the size of the consolidation and observed a negative correlation between the WBC count and the number of consolidations, which both indicate the association of bacterial aetiology with large and solitary consolidations. Biagi et al. studied the usefulness of LUS for diagnosing bacterial superinfection in children (up to 2 years old) with acute bronchiolitis and found that bacterial superinfection is very likely when consolidations larger than 1 cm are detected27. According to our results, this threshold is relatively low, as we found that the median size of the (largest) consolidations in viral CAP was 15 mm. ROC curve analysis has shown that a cut-off of 21 mm consolidation size, as detected with LUS, yielded an optimal sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 75% for differentiating between the viral and bacterial CAP in the present study. We also included 12 (8.2%) patients who were treated with antibiotics before admission. This treatment could cause some regression of consolidations in the bacterial CAP group even before the first LUS was performed24. We assume that the differences in the size of the consolidations between the different types of CAP would be even more significant without those patients.",

In our study, multiple consolidations were detected in only 17.3% of patients with bacterial CAP and were significantly more common (65.4%) in patients with viral CAP. Although Caiulo et al. did not consider the microbial aetiology of CAP, the high percentage of multiple consolidations indicates that they included a substantial proportion of children with viral aetiology. The mean size of the consolidations measured in the study performed by Caiulo et al. was 18 mm, which also supports this presumption, as the value is very close to our results regarding the size of the consolidations in viral CAP. None of the abovementioned studies analysed the position of the consolidations (unilateral vs. bilateral). In our study, LUS-detected, bilateral consolidations were significantly more common in viral CAP (51.9%) than in bacterial CAP (8.0%). These results are in concordance with some of the previous studies using CXR, where bilateral infiltrates were associated with viral pneumonia14. The relatively low proportion of bilateral and/or multiple consolidation in bacterial CAP in our study may result from the exclusion of patients with severe cases of bacterial CAP, who are treated in the ICU. In such cases, multiple consolidations are expected to be more common6. Therefore, we suggest that LUS findings should always be interpreted in light of other clinical and laboratory findings. In our study, we detected bilateral consolidations with LUS in 28.6% of all patients, compared to 18.5% detected with CXR, which also indicates a higher sensitivity of LUS, although we observed a significant agreement between both imaging diagnostics regarding this issue.",

In our study, a regression of consolidations was observed in 96.6% of patients with bacterial CAP and in 33.3% of patients with viral aetiology. We detected no consolidations (complete resolution) at follow-up in 27.6% of patients with bacterial CAP and in only 2.6% of patients with viral CAP. In bacterial CAP, the median size of the consolidation diminished at follow-up LUS to 14.5 mm (from 30 mm) and in viral CAP to 12 mm (from 15 mm). Caiulo et al. followed patients for more than 14 days and observed a regression in 91.6% of patients36. Urbankowska et al. found a complete regression of pneumonic consolidations at follow-up between the 5th and 7th day in 44.0% of patients, and the median size of the (largest) consolidation diminished from 30 mm to 21 mm in that time interval19. The direct comparison of both studies with our results is difficult because we performed the follow-up LUS much earlier in the disease course. The observed proportion (and magnitude) of the regression of consolidations in both studies cited above is somewhere in between our results regarding the regression of bacterial and viral CAP and probably reflects the inclusion of patients with non-bacterial CAP19,36. A faster resolution of bacterial CAP in our study can be attributed to the effect of antibiotic treatment. Musolino et al. also performed follow-up LUS after 2 days of antibiotic treatment and found that pleural effusion disappeared in half of the cases24. LUS has proven to be useful tool for monitoring the effect of treatment on bacterial CAP. We observed a much faster regression of LUS-detected consolidations than previous studies that monitored the resolution of pneumonia with CXR. Radiographic resolution of pneumonia falls well behind the clinical cure assessed by physicians and was observed in only 30.8% of patients after 10 days39. Our results confirm that LUS is the preferred imaging method for the follow-up of CAP, as it almost parallels the clinical course. However, compared to the other analysed LUS characteristics (the size, number and position of consolidations), the findings regarding the course of pneumonic consolidations were of minor importance, as we aimed to improve the initial treatment decisions in patients with CAP.",

According to our results, LUS findings in atypical bacterial pneumonia are similar to those in viral CAP. We observed that the consolidations in atypical bacterial CAP were more likely to be smaller, bilateral and multiple than those in bacterial CAP. With LUS, we detected multiple consolidations in 65.0% and bilateral consolidations in 45.0% of patients with atypical bacterial CAP. Our findings support the results of a study performed by Hsieh et al., where 50% of children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia presented with interstitial and bilateral infiltrates on CXR15. Considering the detection of bilateral infiltrates in atypical bacterial pneumonia, we found LUS to be superior to CXR for differentiating between atypical and bacterial CAP. Bilateral infiltrates were detected with CXR in only 25.0% of our patients with atypical bacterial CAP, which was not significantly more common than in classic bacterial CAP. We observed a slower regression of consolidations in patients with atypical bacterial CAP than in those with classic bacterial CAP. At follow-up, the regression of consolidations as determined by LUS was observed in only 50% of patients and complete resolution was observed in 14.3%, which is similar to that found in viral CAP and significantly less than we observed in classic bacterial CAP. In contrast to our results, a study performed by Bruns et al. with CXR in adults has shown the fastest resolution in atypical bacterial pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae, followed by psittacosis and pneumococcal pneumonia39. However, a comparison of both imaging methods for this purpose is inappropriate because we performed follow-up examinations after a much shorter time period (two to three days) than the interval of a few weeks for CXR-based follow-up performed by Bruns et al.39. Regarding the differentiation of atypical from viral CAP with LUS, we found that the only difference was the larger size of the (largest) consolidation in patients with atypical bacterial CAP (median 20 mm). However, the patients with atypical bacterial CAP were significantly older (median 7 years) than those with viral CAP (median 2.2 years). According to our results, the combination of school age, the presence of crackles on auscultation, moderately increased WBC count and ultrasonic detection of multiple and/or bilateral consolidations of medium-size indicate an infection with atypical bacteria. The differentiation between the viral and atypical bacterial CAP is less important than the identification of classic bacterial CAP. Infection with M. pneumoniae is usually mild and self-limited in otherwise healthy children and can be treated similar to viral LRTI in outpatient settings40. As we included only 20 patients with atypical bacterial CAP, larger samples are warranted to ascertain the LUS characteristics of atypical bacterial CAP.",

We confirmed that laboratory results are probably more accurate in the aetiological diagnosis of CAP, but unlike the clinical characteristics, they are useful only when the diagnosis of CAP is already established. LUS in the hands of an experienced clinician can simultaneously detect CAP and add useful information regarding the aetiological diagnosis. However, the usefulness of LUS is enhanced when used in combination with epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data.",

There is no \u201cgold standard\u201d for the diagnosis of CAP in children, and the differentiation between viral bronchitis/bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia is somehow arbitrary35. Moreover, the microbial diagnosis of pneumonia in children is not easy to determine because we usually do not take specimens from the lower airways. The detection of respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria in the upper airways is not a direct proof of lower respiratory tract infection because prolonged viral shedding or asymptomatic colonization is common in children5. Furthermore, bacterial CAP often follows viral LRTI, and the viruses are still detectable at that time45. Methods to detect bacteria in CAP in children are even less sensitive or specific. Blood culture is positive in less than 10% of children with uncomplicated bacterial CAP46,47. Sputum is seldom obtained from preschool children, and the results are not specific48. In addition, even with the cooperation of another paediatric pulmonologist and the paediatric radiologist in the analysis of LUS cine loops, the problem of interobserver variability in LUS remains a potential confounder. By limiting the study to patients admitted to the hospital, we improved the diagnostic accuracy regarding the correct diagnosis of CAP and the determination of the aetiology. However, the exclusion of milder forms of CAP could represent a selection bias.",

LUS itself is not enough for establishing the microbial diagnosis of CAP but can replace CXR for that purpose in most cases. LUS is especially useful when used in combination with epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data. LUS is harmless, easy to perform and widely available for bedside investigation. In comparison with the results of microbiological investigations, LUS results are immediately available to the clinician, who must decide about the initial empirical treatment. We predict that LUS will be established as the first-line imaging method in children with CAP and that it will replace CXR for that purpose in most patients. The inclusion of lung ultrasound in the guidelines for CAP management is already warranted. However, better standardization of the investigation is required in the future to diminish the large intra- and interobserver variability of the results.",
