            "text": "Session 1 focused on the recent trends of viral infections in Asia and the Pacific Rim. This session aimed to review some of the important new, long-time, and re-emerging infectious viral threats in Asia, and to consider the research and public health response needed for addressing them. Information was provided about newly recognized viral infections (e.g., Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV)) and previously under-appreciated epidemiology of well-known viral infections (e.g., hepatitis viruses), as well as highlights of serious virus outbreaks currently in the public eye (e.g., dengue and Zika).\nAvian influenza: The first presentation focused on the threat of avian influenza A H7N9 virus, which currently causes zoonotic infections that are mostly acquired in live bird markets. One rest day (closure) in poultry markets has a significant impact in reducing virus persistence and transmission of the virus through aerosols in poultry handling and de-feathering areas. The reported cases of H7N9 influenza underestimates the extent of human infection, and the effect of vaccination needs to be further studied.Hepatitis: Another talk reported on the endemic prevalence of hepatitis viruses in Mongolia, which has the highest rate of liver cancer mortality in the world that is about 12 times the global average. The high prevalence is mostly health-system driven, with the use of dirty needles and improper sterilization of dental equipment, but injection drug abuse also contributes. Sixty percent of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected Mongols are co-infected with hepatitis delta virus (HDV). The government of Mongolia adopted a plan that includes screening every citizen for hepatitis virus infection to prevent, control, and eventually eliminate hepatitis in Mongolia.Dengue: An overview of dengue, a public health priority in the region, was presented. The distribution of dengue is widespread and inflicts a high medical and cost burden. The pathogenesis of dengue virus infection remains unclear, and there are pitfalls in diagnosis and management of the disease. There has been a shift in the epidemiology, with infections and disease moving to rural areas.Zika: A presentation of the current state of Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemiology was provided. ZIKV is amplified much more frequently than other viruses through Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitos. Particularly in Africa, strains were seen to be transmitted much more efficiently by Aedes aegypti and there is no evidence that primates are intermediates of transmission. Several different topics were discussed about ZIKV including the association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome, when and how ZIKV arrived in the Americas, and whether chikungunya and dengue virus infections can provide insight into ZIKV infection in the Americas. Several studies have failed to provide evidence of immune enhancement, although the question remains if dengue virus immunity affects ZIKV infection or vice versa. The evolution of urban transmission was also considered, with the emergence of different virus strains.Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF): The expansion of CCHF to Asia was reviewed. CCHFV is an orthonairovirus transmitted by the bite of the tick, Hyalomma marginatum. The incubation period of the infection is 2\u20137 days, and death occurs in 7\u20139 days. The re-assortment of genes among the CCHF viruses can lead to new strains and new diseases, with many countries reporting increased numbers of cases. This may be due to more infected ticks, amplification, migratory birds, or the live animal trade. Increased tick activity has been observed during the Eid festival, which coincides with backyard slaughter of animals, and an increase in human infection.",

            "text": "Session 2 focused on the pathogenesis of emerging viral infections affecting Southeast Asian countries and their divergent mechanisms.\nHepatitis C: The first talk in this session compared the level of immune markers, such as PD-1 and CD91, before and after antiviral treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and found that those levels were lower after treatment.Coronavirus: The next presentation shared how in coronaviruses, exoribonuclease (ExoN) plays a key role in maintaining a low mutational rate for the virus, and exon deletion increases the mutation rate as well as the attenuation of pathogenesis.Enterovirus 71 (EV71): Then a talk focused on the EV71 carrying VP1-145E variants, which are mainly responsible for the development of viremia and neuropathogenesis in a non-human primate model. This further suggested the involvement of amino acid polymorphism at VP1-145 in cell-specific viral replication, in vivo fitness, and pathogenesis in EV71-infected individuals.HIV-1: One talk presented that HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a key target of newly developed anti-retroviral drugs. High-resolution cryo-EM analysis demonstrated that IN assembles into a multimeric structure, up to 16 monomers in size, to form the intasome structure that mediates chromosomal integration. The resolution of the active site revealed the strand transfer inhibitor drug target, as well as potential new structural targets for next-generation IN inhibitors. Another talk reported that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B57 and HLA-B27 haplotypes are associated with the control of HIV-1 viremia and disease progression in Caucasian and African populations, but are poorly represented in people of Japanese descent. The research team found that HLA-B52:01 and HLA-C12:02, found in approximately 20% of Japanese individuals, is associated with significantly lower HIV-1 viral loads and increased CD4 cell counts. In addition, the natural killer (NK) cell receptor, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 2DL2, may also contribute to the control of HIV-1 in Japanese individuals, suggesting both cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and NK responses play an important role in controlling HIV disease progression.Reovirus: A talk featured the reovirus reverse genetic system, which was established by transfecting the cell via plasmids, each coding a segment of reovirus genome. This is a major development for the reovirus field.Hepatitis B (HBV): The host Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) protein, found to be an essential component for HBV infection in the liver, was discussed. The Ser267Phe (S267F) variant of NTCP is inversely associated with HBV pathogenesis and cirrhosis. The NTCP sequence is also a determinant for host range.Zika: A talk showed that dengue 2 antibody levels appear to determine susceptibility to ZIKV infection with high dengue 2 titers being protective, while lower titers enhance infection.",

Through an extensive clinical network of patients in China, randomized clinical trials are being conducted to study new treatment strategies for chronic HBV infection involving nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors and peginterferon. An ongoing effort to prevent mother\u2013child transmission of HBV through a short-term antiviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate during late pregnancy, reported a significantly lower HBV transmission rate compared to the control group. This session also included a discussion of host factors related to hepatitis virus infection using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A genetic analysis using GWAS, identified host factors for various human multifactorial diseases, as well as interferon (IFN) lambda for drug response, and HLA II genes for susceptibility to chronic HBV infection (CHB). Frequencies of HLA-DP risk alleles are high in Asian populations, whereas frequencies of HLA-DP protective alleles are high in European populations. These findings could explain the high incidence of CHB in Asian countries and suggest that host genetic factors are important to viral infections. Another talk outlined the genomic and epigenomic associations in HBV-related liver cancer using data obtained from whole genome bisulfate sequencing and whole genome sequencing. Clonal HBV integrations preferentially occurred in inactive chromatin regions; massive rearrangements were detected in the integrated HBV genome, and a negative correlation exists between HBV rearrangement number and total somatic mutation number. These observations could be useful for understanding the progression of HBV-related liver cancer. It was noted that liver cancer, including HCC and cholangiocarcinoma, is the second leading cause of cancer death (about 9.1% of total cancer deaths) with a significant burden in low- and middle-income countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Etiological factors associated with HCC include infection with HBV and exposure to high levels of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the diet. HCV-associated HCC is becoming the most rapidly rising solid tumor in the United States and Japan. The development of highly effective drugs that cure HCV infection is a major advance that, hopefully, will diminish the role of HCV in liver cancer. Ongoing clinical investigations are defining the utility of GPC3, a cell surface proteoglycan differentially expressed in HCC, and other promising antibody therapeutics to treat liver cancer.",

An ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil was also discussed.Zika: An overview of a promising experimental single-dose live-attenuated Zika vaccine that was evaluated in non-human primates was presented. This was found to prevent infection and achieve protective immunity within 14 days post-vaccination.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: The global disease burden of RSV and the need for more than one RSV vaccine to target different age populations were described. Also an overview of the RSV vaccines currently in clinical development: vaccine-like particle, live-attenuated, and vector-based vaccines, were further discussed.HIV/AIDS: A talk summarized the findings from a cohort study of individuals identified with acute HIV infection in Bangkok, Thailand.Influenza: A detailed description of a universal influenza virus vaccine strategy based on the conserved stalk domain of hemagglutinin was presented.Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD): The epidemiological baseline of HFMD caused by multiple serotypes of enterovirus in China and the implications for vaccine development were discussed.Chikungunya: A presentation described the versatility and advantages of a measles vector vaccine platform and the Phase 2 clinical safety and immunogenicity of a measles-vectored chikungunya vaccine.",

A new protein delivery system was also introduced, which may potentially become a component of a needleless vaccine candidate.ZIKV: The structural biology of ZIKV proteins suggests potential drug targets in the non-structural 1 (NS1) and non-structural 5 (NS5) viral proteins. The NS1 structure could provide information on host interaction and protective antibody recognition, as well as potential drug target sites. Structural analysis needs to be confirmed with functional data to demonstrate further if drug candidates, such as those against dengue virus, would be effective for ZIKV infection.",

Session 3 on \u201cHIV, Host Cell, and Microbiome Interactions\u201d included presentations about host cell factors that impact HIV assembly, entry and immune responses, as well as a potential new source of latently infected cells in infected individuals. The final session titled \u201cMucosal Immunology and Vaccine Responses\u201d included discussions of mucosal immunology, the intestinal virome, and immune control of herpesviruses. Other talks on viral diseases highlighted the commonality of viruses that, like HIV, target mucosal sites for transmission and replication and emphasized the importance of cross-disciplinary studies in viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. Discussions also focused on T-cell and NK cell responses to HIV and on strategies to perturb the lymphoid tissue architecture to flush out residual, latently infected T cells from follicular sanctuary sites. Partnering with the immunology board was particularly appreciated, as the focus on mucosal and intestinal immunology in other virologic diseases is highly relevant to HIV. Dr. Hiroshi Kiyono (University of Tokyo, Japan) from the immunology board concluded the panel meeting with a remembrance and a moment of silence to commemorate Dr. Bonnie Mathieson, who passed away on January 8th, 2018. Dr. Mathieson was a program official at NIAID and the OAR for over 40 years, touching the lives of countless research scientists around the globe.",

Keigo Shibayama (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan) and Florian Krammer (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, U.S.A.), with secretariat Dr. Kristina T. Lu (NIAID, U.S.A.). The meeting sessions focused on 1) viral respiratory diseases, 2) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 3) Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 4) coronavirus antiviral therapeutics, 5) transmission, pathogenesis, and immunity of influenza, and 6) influenza virus vaccines and inhibitors. The main objectives of the ARI panel meeting were to discuss recent research advances in viral acute respiratory infections and to establish collaborations and share resources amongst panel members and colleagues. The ARI panel meeting featured outstanding presentations of mostly novel, unpublished data followed by very active, constructive discussions and was deemed a huge success to be continued in 2019 for bacterial acute respiratory infections. Robust discussions and interactions occurred between the panel members and the audience, and several collaborations were further developed.",

The keynote lecture by Dr. Raymond Chung (Massachusetts General Hospital, U.S.A.) kicked off the two-day meeting with a discussion on the current understanding of a cure for chronic hepatitis B and the challenges for the complete elimination of HBV because of the stable and self-perpetuating replication intermediate of HBV DNA. The panel meeting included four sessions: 1) Chronic hepatitis B in Asia\u2014scope of the problem and exploring new treatments; 2) markers of a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B; 3) preclinical animal models for testing HBV curative therapies; and 4) regulation of HBV replication and new targets for HBV therapy. In addition to the panelist presentations, posters were presented by early-stage investigators. The hepatitis panel meeting featured exceptional presentations, collaborative discussions, successful outcomes, and will be reconvened in 2020.",

The 1.5-day panel meeting focused on the following session topics: 1) hemorrhagic viruses including Ebola, Lassa, and Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a highly pathogenic and recently emerged virus in Asian countries including Japan, Korea, and China; 2) enteric viruses including norovirus, rotavirus, poliovirus, and EV71, a virus causing hand and foot and mouth disease in Southeast Asian countries; 3) arboviruses including dengue, SFTSV, and chikungunya viruses; and 4) rabies virus and included aspects such as epidemiology, pathogenesis, structural biology, animal models, vaccines and antiviral developments, and human challenge models for dengue virus. There were significant presentations by junior/early-stage career scientists and discussions during the meeting were robust due to active participation and engaging discussions. Notable presentations from early-stage investigators selected from abstract submissions included a talk on a clinical trial of an investigational vaccine, called AGS-v, against mosquito saliva peptide. If proven effective, this vaccine can protect against mosquito-borne viral infections. Another presentation was on a broad-spectrum antiviral peptide that is shown to be active against Zika virus given post infection in an animal model. The viral diseases panel will reconvene in 2020.",
