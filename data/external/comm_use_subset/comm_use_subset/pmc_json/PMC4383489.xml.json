Improvements in case diagnosis and management will be central to achieving this aim. Significant loss of intravascular plasma volume leading to hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome (DSS)), usually between the 4th-6th day of illness, is the commonest life-threatening complication of dengue [1, 4]. It\u2019s widely held that the case-incidence of DSS can be reduced via careful monitoring and the judicious use of parenteral fluids to maintain an adequate intravascular volume [1]. Ideally, this case management approach is enabled because the attending physician had made an early diagnosis and thus alerted clinicians, nurses and family caregivers to the signs and symptoms suggestive of clinical worsening. Additional benefits of an early diagnosis include support to community level public health interventions and improvements in the sensitivity of case surveillance systems and disease burden estimates. Furthermore, it is likely that the therapeutic window of opportunity for a dengue antiviral drug lies in the first 48\u201372 hours of illness [5]. Thus, programmatic use of therapeutic interventions in the future will likely go hand in hand with strategies for early diagnosis.",

            "text": "Yet there are numerous challenges for busy primary care clinicians in making a diagnosis of dengue in the first few days of illness. Rapid lateral flow tests, based on the detection of the viral NS1 antigen, are available in some settings and can provide a confirmatory diagnosis [6\u20138]. The diagnostic performance of the WHO dengue case definition, which relies on non-specific signs and symptoms that overlap with other infectious diseases, is unknown in the first few days of illness [1]. Potts et al concluded that more prospective studies were needed to construct a valid and generalizable algorithm to guide the differential diagnosis of dengue in endemic countries [9]. To this end, several prospective studies have described the creation of classifiers for the diagnosis of dengue [10\u201312]. However none of these studies have exclusively focused on pediatric fever cases presenting to primary care facilities with short illness histories, a very common scenario in dengue endemic settings. Against this backdrop, the purpose of the current study was to prospectively derive a dengue diagnostic algorithm from routinely collected clinical and laboratory findings in pediatric patients with <72 hours of illness history and compare this approach against the diagnostic performance of a leading NS1 rapid test (BioRad NS1 Ag STRIP) in the same patients. The results provide pragmatic methods to enhance the early diagnosis of dengue in primary care settings.",

The most parsimonious model, derived from stability selection, used the patient\u2019s age, white cell count and platelet count at the time of enrolment to classify dengue from non-dengue cases (Table 3). Alternative approaches to feature selection yielded models with only slightly higher performance but relied on many more (more than ten) variables (S4 Table). The most parsimonious model, herein called the Early Dengue Classifier (EDC), had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0\u201376.8%), specificity of 76.3% (95%CI: 75.2\u201377.6%), positive predictive value of 57.1% (95%CI: 56.2\u201359.0%), and negative predictive value of 87.8% (95%CI: 86.8\u201388.5%) for correctly classifying dengue cases in the entire dataset at the pre-defined cut-off of 33.3%. Of note, this pre-defined cut-off reflecting clinical priorities was very close to the cut-off corresponding to the point on the ROC curve closest to the upper left corner (perfect model), which was 34.2% (Fig 1A). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.829 (Fig 1B) and the predicted risk of dengue agreed well with the observed risk (Fig 1C). The EDC had sensitivity of 72.9% (95% CI: 69.6\u201376.6%) for DENV1, 74.7% (95%CI: 71.0\u201379.7%) for DENV2, 68.4% (95%CI: 59.2\u201374.5%) for DENV3 and 78.2% (95%CI: 75.5\u201383.3%) for DENV4 infection. The overall performance characteristics of the EDC under temporal, leave-one-site-out validation or seasonality (rainy versus dry season), are summarized in S5 Table.

This current study extends that literature in several ways. First, by virtue of the large sample size we demonstrate with high precision the differential sensitivity of the NS1 Ag STRIP for different DENV serotypes. This test was sensitive (between 75\u201385%) for DENV-1, -3 and -4 infections, but poorly sensitive in DENV-2 infections (46.4%). Lower sensitivity was partially attributable to the great majority of DENV-2 infections being associated with secondary serological responses, although we note sensitivity was also low in primary DENV-2 infections. This suggests that there are particular virological (e.g. lower viral burdens in vivo) or intrinsic aspects of the NS1 test, that limit DENV-2 NS1 detection. [23\u201326]. Second, we make the novel observation that 5\u201310 fold enrichment of proteins with molecular weight >100kDa in plasma specimens (the NS1 hexamer has predicted molecular weight of 310kDa [27]) did not lead to improved NS1 detection rates. These data suggest that dengue patients who return negative NS1 rapid test results in the first 3 days of illness have free plasma NS1 concentrations substantially below the limit of sensitivity of existing assays and that 2nd generation tests might need to be at least an order of magnitude more sensitive. Nonetheless, better NS1 rapid diagnostic tests are needed if they are going to be widely adopted by clinical services in primary care settings. In malaria, HRP2 rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum infection are an example of how improvements to assay performance can lead to recognition as a diagnostic standard of care [28]. Finally, although serum NS1 concentrations have been proposed to have prognostic value in a small study, this is yet to be independently validated and is likely to be difficult given that blood NS1 concentrations vary widely according to the infecting DENV serotype, serological response and day of illness [8, 24, 29, 30].",

What is striking in the literature is that only three prospective studies have considered dengue diagnostic algorithms exclusively in children and of these the largest contained 1227 patients, of who 614 had dengue [11, 38, 39]. More generally, most diagnostic studies failed to report positive and negative predictive values for their diagnostic algorithms, thus making it difficult to assess their utility in routine practice. Against this backdrop, a strength of the current study is the large sample size, the presence of all four DENV serotypes, robust statistical validation techniques and transparent performance characteristics. The clinical signs and symptoms that make up the WHO case definition for dengue were not used in the final, parsimonious diagnostic EDC classifier. Instead, we found that only three variables\u2014patient age, white blood cell count and platelet count, provided similar discriminatory information as alternative models that relied upon a much larger set of clinical data.",

We concur with Potts et al in the belief that diagnostic rules for dengue are not a replacement for good clinical acumen and management [9]. Nonetheless, the EDC described here offers an evidence-based guide that can likely improve the prevailing diagnostic accuracy of most Vietnamese physicians working in primary care who do not possess extensive experience in dengue diagnosis and management. In particular, in settings where NS1 rapid tests are not routinely available or affordable, or where DENV-2 is the most prevalent virus in circulation, the EDC could help guide clinicians in making their differential diagnosis. An early diagnosis of dengue can assist in patient triage and management by directing clinical/caregiver attention to clinical warning signs and/or the appearance of capillary permeability, for which supportive oral and/or parenteral fluid therapy is recommended in order to prevent circulatory compromise. Additionally, in the first days of illness many dengue cases are infectious to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and hence an early diagnosis could support measures to prevent further transmission, e.g. by use of topical repellents and local mosquito control [40].",

The EDC relies on routine hematology findings that are commonly accessible in primary care settings in Vietnam but might not be available everywhere. By design, our study focused on patients with <72 hours of illness and hence our results might not be applicable to patients who present to medical care at later time-points. By using the age of the patient as a component of the EDC, it\u2019s likely that the EDC would not perform well in settings where the burden of dengue falls on age-groups different from that in southern Vietnam. Nonetheless, this study has delivered the largest population-based and quantitative framework to guide early diagnosis of pediatric dengue. Further prospective validation in Vietnam and other endemic countries with similar epidemiology will be needed to establish the clinical utility of the EDC.",
