South China is comprised of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces, Central China is comprised of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang provinces, and North China is comprised of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning provinces, as well as Beijing and Tianjin (municipal cities). As shown in Table 1, the H5N1 influenza infection cases mainly occurred in South, Central, and Northwest China, with the most (eight cases) in Hunan Province.

As shown in Table 2, the p-values for RHU.mean, PRS.mean, and WIN.mean were <0.05. These results imply that there were significant differences between H7N9 and H5N1 infections in terms of humidity, pressure, and wind speed. H5N1 infections occurred with the highest frequency in a humidity range of 60\u201370%, while H7N9 infections occurred in the 70\u201380% rage (Fig. 1B). In terms of atmospheric pressure, the cases of H5N1 were concentrated at 990\u20131020 kPa, while the occurrences of H7N9 infection were found at 1000\u20131030 kPa (Fig. 1C). In addition, as the composition of meteorological factors, the wind speed during H5N1 cases was concentrated at 1\u20132 m/s, while the occurrences of H7N9 infection were found at 2\u20133 m/s wind speed (Fig. 1F). Temperature and specific humidity were the best individual influence factors for influenza infection. According to null hypothesis 1, both the mean value of the air temperature and the mean value of the ground surface temperature displayed no significant difference comparing H5N1 and H7N9 infections. H5N1 influenza occurred with the highest frequency in a temperature range of 5\u201310 \u00b0C, with a second peak in the range of 15\u201320 \u00b0C. H7N9 influenza occurred with the highest frequency in a temperature range of 10\u201315 \u00b0C, with a second peak in the interval of 5\u201310 \u00b0C. Consistent with the TEM value, the H5N1 influenza infection cases were relatively more prevalent when the ground surface temperature was 5\u201310 \u00b0C, with a second peak at 15\u201320 \u00b0C; H7N9 influenza infection cases peaked at 10\u201315 \u00b0C and 5\u201310 \u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 1A,D).",

The Chi-squared test was used to test this hypothesis. As shown in Table 3, we found that the p-value for all of climate is <0.05. These results demonstrate that there were significant relationships between climate factors and H5/H7 influenza infection. To further understand the relationships among these factors with H5/H7 infection, we conducted principal component analysis (PCA) for all climate factors employed in our study. As shown in Table 4, Fig. 2A and Supplementary Video S2, the results from the H7N9 influenza cases indicate that the first principle component, whose dominant contributors are temperature variables (i.e., TEM.mean, TEM.high, TEM.low, and GST.mean) explain 49.11% of the total variance; the second principle component, which is dominated by relative humidity variables (i.e., RHU.mean and RHU.low), explains 24.20% of the total variance. The third principle component was dominated by wind speed (WIN.mean) and other variables and only explains 14.77% of the total variance. The total contribution of these three sets of climatic variables accounted for 88.04% of the total contribution.",

In contrast to H7N9, the second principle component of H5N1 was dominated by pressure (i.e., PRS.mean), which explains 17.69% of the total variance, and the third principle component included humidity and other variables, explaining 16.17% of the total variance. The total contribution of these three sets of climatic variables accounted for 80.78% of the total contribution.

However, we found that the most adaptive meteorological conditions for the occurrence of the human cases of these two AIV subtypes are different. For example, most H5N1 cases appeared when the atmospheric humidity was 60\u201370%, whereas H7N9 cases predominantly occurred when the humidity was between 70\u201380%. In addition, differential atmosphere pressure and wind speed favor the occurrence of H7N9 and H5N1 cases, respectively. However, what underlies these differences is unknown and deserves further investigation. Several lines of evidence indicate that the high incidence of the featured seasonal pattern of H5N1 virus infection in poultry in China2223, consistent with the human cases of H5N1 influenza virus in our study. Furthering the understanding of the correlation between the survival ability of the viruses relative to climatic factors should be considered.",

Temperature factors and relative humidity are the dominant variables for PC1 and PC2 (respectively) for H7N9, while temperature and pressure are the key factors for H5N1 cases. These results suggest the possibility of using temperature and relative humidity to approximate the effects that the climate factors have upon human H7N9 infection. Just as compared with highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV), the H5N1 virus shows differential environmental factors. Although climatic factors exhibit a strong correlation with H7N9 or H5N1 infection, other crucial factors doubtlessly include the density of the pathogen virus, human behavior, and population density.",

The risk areas for human H5N1 infection were more concentrated in South and Central China in our analysis. HPAIV viruses are generally thought to arise in poultry after domestic birds become infected by LPAI H5 and H7 viruses from the wild-bird reservoir31. The probable long co-existence of multiple viruses in multiple hosts provides the driving force for the virus to adapt to infect humans. Furthermore, it is difficult to identify humans, birds, or pigs infected with subclinical H7N9/H5N1 viruses from clinical signs, and it is extremely difficult to conduct large-scale surveillance to identify virus infections in humans, birds, or pigs for an extended period. Therefore, we must pay more attention to overlap areas.",

Consequently, permanently closing LPMs would likely prove unpopular, and therefore, their periodic closure may represent a more viable compromise.
