In an analysis of published articles and those posted on preprint servers, the authors found that preprint posting increased during the 2015\u201317 outbreak of Zika in the Americas relative to the 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and that preprints, while still used for only a small proportion of papers, provided much earlier access to scientific findings [1].",

For the most part, posting of preprints has been occasional, undertaken on the initiative of authors without the journal\u2019s involvement. In the coming months, PLOS journals that handle research in more basic biological fields will begin facilitating preprint posts of journal submissions, with author approval, on the bioRxiv preprint server operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory [6]. PLOS Medicine will not initially be offering transfer of submitted manuscripts to bioRxiv as preprints. Because the journal\u2019s scope encompasses clinical and policy-related research, we believe it is important now to establish appropriate standards for the early sharing of research that has potential implications for human health but has not been peer reviewed. As preprint servers for clinically focused research become more widely available and preprint posting becomes more routine and more closely integrated with journal publishing, editors of medical journals should join the conversation about best practices for preprint sharing in medical research.",

In medical research, competing interests have been shown to be associated with reported outcomes [7], and editors and peer reviewers persuade authors to tone down overstated conclusions prior to publication as a matter of course. At the same time, the press and other media networks are expected to disseminate the latest available information, and even readers with an urgent interest in a given health-related topic may be hard pressed to assess the validity of research methodology. As publication practices evolve, what is the best way for the medical research community to fulfill the Hippocratic imperative to do no harm while avoiding undue delays that may result in harm?",

For clinical trials, preprints should include reference to the trial\u2019s registration in a WHO-approved database [8] and should follow the widely accepted CONSORT reporting guideline for clinical trials [9]. For observational and epidemiological studies, preprints should indicate whether analyses were prospectively determined (in which case the prespecified analysis plan should be included) or exploratory in nature. Ensuring that practices to promote transparency, which should already be part of manuscript preparation, translate to preprints will support their legitimacy and usefulness as a form of scientific communication.",

Sound judgment by authors, journal editors (when involved in screening or facilitating preprint posts), and preprint services must inform the decision to post a preprint.
