In August 2014, two American health-care workers infected with Ebola were treated with Zmapp\u2122, an experimental drug containing three mAbs against Ebola.9 Unfortunately, the drug supply was only sufficient to treat seven patients and efforts had to be made to increase production before clinical evaluation could take place.10 Efficacy trials in Ebola infected patients in West Africa were completed in January 2016. However, due to the waning epidemic, the trial could only enroll 72 patients out of the planned 200. The outcomes showed that out of the 36 patients who received Zmapp\u2122, eight died, which was less than in the group receiving only standard care (13 of 35 patients died). However, the trial sample size was too low to draw any conclusions.11 Despite this setback, anti-Ebola mAb development \u2013 which has been ongoing for several years and the first neutralizing mAb reported in 199912 \u2013 continues towards the goal of licensure under alternative pathways to standard randomized controlled clinical trials.",

The small number of patients, the unpredictable outbreaks and epidemiology and the high fatality associated with the ethical challenges of conducting randomized clinical trials, are obstacles when evaluating mAbs as a treatment for such diseases. Therefore, alternative regulatory pathways for product licensure are needed. However, many countries do not have mechanisms in place for such pathways and there is no framework in place for testing, licensure and use of mAbs. In addition, consensus on acceptable clinical endpoints and definition of conditions under which mAbs would be used, are lacking.
