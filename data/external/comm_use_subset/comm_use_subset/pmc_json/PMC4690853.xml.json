Moreover, precise mechanisms remain to be resolved as reports on the involvement of p53-independent [3,4] as well as p53-dependent mechanisms [5] during RV-induced cell death are conflicting. Additionally, prolonged survival of RV-infected cells is ensured by the induction of the phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K)/AKT survival pathway [6] and by anti-apoptotic activities of the viral C protein [7,8]. These viral infection-promoting activities of the C protein involve its localization to mitochondria and its interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) and the mitochondrial matrix protein p32 (gC1qR), [7,9]. The p32 protein is required for viral replication [10] and for transport of mitochondria to viral replication complexes [11]. In addition to its interaction with mitochondrial proteins, RV infection has an impact on mitochondrial bioenergetic function [11,12].",

            "text": "Due to the interdependency of apoptotic and metabolic pathways [13], the mitochondria-based signaling platform might contribute to RV-associated programmed cell death. The intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway can be induced by cytotoxic stress during ongoing viral replication and is usually accompanied by permeabilization of the inner (IMM) and/or outer (OMM) mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial permeabilization is characterized by formation of \u201cdeath decision pores\u201d, such as ceramide lipid pores; the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC) formed in response to OMM permeabilization (MOMP); and the relatively large mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which originates at the IMM [14]. MOMP and subsequently MAC formation can result from oligomerization of Bcl-2 family members such as Bax and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (Bak). Through the formation of these death decision pores, mitochondrial function is lost and the apoptotic cascade is further fueled, as metabolites, small ions and apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c (Cytc), Smac/Diablo, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and/or endonuclease G (Endo G) are released. The coordination of these processes involves the tumor-suppressor protein p53, which executes its function through both a transcription-dependent (nuclear) and transcription-independent (mitochondrial) pathway. The former influences the mRNA level of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors and the latter involves direct regulation of protein functions at mitochondria, e.g., activation of the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins [15]. Additionally, p53 might also interact directly with mitochondria and induce MOMP by itself [16].",

The multifunctional cyclophilins as proteins of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family are highly conserved molecular chaperons that support protein folding and isomerization and thus participate in the cellular stress response [17]. To study the contribution of apoptosis-promoting parameters to RV-associated cellular aberrations, selected pharmacological compounds were applied to RV-infected cells. Presented data point to a contribution of mitochondrial translocation of p53, partial opening of the mPTP and nuclear shuttling of AIF and cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40) to RV-induced apoptosis, which occurs at least partly in a strain-specific manner.",

The pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk as an already-described inhibitor of RV-induced apoptosis [7,18] was applied as a positive control to assess the effectiveness of N-methyl-4-isoleucine cyclosporine (NIM811) and pifithrin (PFT) \u03bc. The cyclosporine A analog NIM811 is a non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitor. PFT\u03bc is an inhibitor of the mitochondrial translocation of p53, which reduces the binding affinity of p53 to B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) and acts upstream of Bax [19]. Time course experiments were performed to determine the optimal time point for addition of the respective inhibitor. As an indicator for RV-induced cell death, the number of detached cells (the floaters) in the supernatant can be determined [18]. Hence compound effectiveness was assessed at 72 h post-infection (hpi) through harvesting and counting the number of floaters. Figure 1A shows the effect of z-VAD-fmk at 12.5 and 25 \u03bcM, PFT\u03bc at 12.5 \u03bcM and NIM811 at 2 \u03bcM (applied at 2, 24 and 48 hpi) on the floater population. In comparison to the respective solvent control (SC, set at 100%), the number of floaters was significantly reduced by all three compounds (Figure 1A), but at varying degrees, which was also dependent on the application time point. NIM811 was the least effective compound, while the effectiveness of PFT\u03bc was comparable to z-VAD-fmk. The greatest level of reduction in the floater population was reached after application of PFT\u03bc (27% \u00b1 2% of the SC) and z-VAD-fmk (30% \u00b1 3% and 28% \u00b1 3% of the SC for 12.5 \u03bcM and 25 \u03bcM, respectively) at 24 hpi.",

PFT\u03b1 was thus applied to RV-infected Vero cells to test the second branch of p53 activity, which is based on its function as a transcription factor. However, in contrast to PFT\u03bc, PFT\u03b1 had a noticeable negative effect on viral progeny generation (Figure 1B), hence it was excluded from subsequent experiments.",

Upon RV infection, AIF-TagRFP can be found in mitochondria, as expected, and as it was oberserved in mock-infected cells (Figure 3A). However, in contrast to the mock infection, AIF-TagRFP can also be found in the nucleus and especially in areas of condensed chromatin (Figure 3Aa\u2013d). In some cases, nuclear counterstaining with Hoechst bisbenzamide was hardly traceable (Figure 3Ad). However, Western blot analysis with anti-AIF antibody revealed no detectable change in AIF concentration in the mitochondria-enriched fraction derived at 3 dpi from RV-infected Vero cells as compared to the one obtained from mock-infected cells (Figure 3B).

In the case of RV-infected Vero cells (3 dpi), a minor but distinct portion of cells appear to have lost CytC from their mitochondria (Figure 4A). To further validate this observation, selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with digitonin was performed. First, the lowest possible concentration of digitonin was determined, which gives a detectable fluorescence signal for a cytoplasmic protein, in this case alpha-tubulin. As a positive control, Figure 4B,C illustrate the signal for the cytoplasmic protein alpha-tubulin and the mitochondrial protein CytC after 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation and permeabilization with methanol. Figure 4B highlights that permeabilization with digitonin at 25 \u03bcg/mL after 2% (w/v) PFA fixation gives a sufficient signal for alpha-tubulin after application of its respective antibody. However, a remarkable signal loss occurs after application of digitonin at 1 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 4B). Hence, digitonin was applied at 25 \u03bcg/mL to verify CytC localization outside of mitochondria. As shown in Figure 4C, no CytC signal can be detected in mock-treated cells. However, overnight incubation with 0.003% H2O2 produces a distinct CytC signal in the cytoplasm, which was also detectable for RV-infected cells (3 dpi).

Subsequently immunofluorescence analysis of the intracellular distribution of p53 and the mitochondria-associated viral C protein revealed punctate staining of p53 outside of the nucleus, close to C protein-positive areas (Figure 5E). These areas overlap with an area of clustered mitochondria typical for RV-infected Vero cells, which have a highly intense MitoTracker DeepRed CMX Ros staining (Figure 5E, shown in white). In summary, RV induces mitochondrial and nuclear translocation of p53. Whereas the former decreased after application of 12.5 \u03bcM PFT\u03bc, the latter increased.",

Figure 7A highlights that after permeabilization with Tween 20, hardly any differences between mock- and RV-infected Vero cells and Vero cells after overnight incubation with 0.003% hydrogen peroxide are noticeable. This is in contrast to permeabilization with Triton X-100, which shows a clear shift of CypA from a cytoplasmic to a nuclear localization (Figure 7B(12)). However, as compared to the mock-infected control, only a slight shift of CypA to the nucleus can be speculated after infection with RV (Figure 7B(4,8)).

This suggests that during cell-culture adaptation RV strains have evolved mechanisms to counteract or to avoid nuclear localization of p53. The application of PFT\u03bc appears to support the previously published anti-apoptotic activity of Therien, which is also reflected by the association of its C protein with Bax [7]. The present paper ties in with this reported involvement of a mitochondrial signaling pathway in RV-infected A549 cells and subsequently viral strategies to counteract cellular death mechanisms. Additionally, application of PFT\u03bc to RV-infected Vero cells increases p53 nuclear expression during RV infection, highlighting that blocking one branch of p53 activity favors the other. However, Therien appears not to be affected by the PFT\u03bc-associated increase in nuclear p53 localization, as PFT\u03bc reduces CPE.",

Nevertheless, there are also cases in which cyclophilins restrict viral replication [24]. No cellular functions that are vital for RV replication were affected by the application of NIM811 as reflected by the maintained virus production rate. It is important to note that RV specifically affects the expression pattern of the ubiquitous protein Cyp40 that acts as co-chaperone of the Hsp90/Hsp70 complex and guides its interaction with other proteins, including those involved in antiviral host response [30]. Cyp40 is occasionally referred to as CypD, which contributes to some unresolved issues in its physiological functions. Its participation in protein maturation pathways [17], especially its nuclear localization after stress induction by UVA treatment [31], heat stress [32], or RV infection as shown here, certainly warrants further exploration and points to a multitude of physiological functions. Especially heat stress parallels some of the effects exerted by RV on its host cell, including Cyp40 nuclear redistribution and an increase in the Cyp40 mRNA level [32]. Noteworthy in this context is that Hsp90-binding cyclophilins such as Cyp40 are involved in protein trafficking to the nucleus, including p53 [33].",

Data presented in this paper highlight mPTP opening and mitochondrial-nuclear translocation of AIF in a minor portion of cells under RV infection. Being released from mitochondria, AIF is a potent apoptosis-promoting factor [34]. Its nuclear translocation is followed by chromatinolysis and DNA fragmentation. However, the contribution of AIF and cyclophilins to RV-associated cell death appears to be negligible as indicated by the minor effect exerted by NIM811 on RV floater population or on selected markers for apoptosis. The observed release of CytC could help to explain the reported reduction of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV activity during RV infection [12].",

Hence, in RV-infected Vero cells, its apoptosis regulation and protein-folding functions appear to be separated. This notion also applies to the interaction of CypD with some of its protein partners, including hexokinase II [35] and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) [36]. Additionally, a modulation of mPTP independent from its enzymatic activity was reported [37]. It was just published that mPTP is a regulatory component of vascular function [38], which should be viewed in the light of the perturbance of angiogenic processes seen with patients suffering from congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) [39].",

However, the use of just one cell line for most of the results shown in this study limits the conclusions that can be drawn for RV-induced apoptosis. In future studies, the observed apoptotic effects induced by RV strains in Vero cells, which are of simian origin, need to be further addressed in relevant human cell lines such as fetal fibroblasts and the A549 cell line.

Already minor changes can evoke alterations of cellular antiviral activities, as shown in this paper by the increase in p53 nuclear expression after inhibiting mitochondrial shuttling of p53 with PFT\u03bc. CPE induction after RV infection is only observed after infection of susceptible cell lines such as Vero and RK13 [2]. It is especially noteworthy that RV-induced apoptosis is detectable in human primary differentiated, nonproliferative cells, but not in proliferative fetal cells [43]. This strengthens the cellular context dependency of RV-associated apoptotic processes, which might be due to differences in cellular signaling pathways or to differences in the anti-viral response provoked by RV in these cell lines. The identification of cellular factors specific for RV-induced cell death as outlined in this study will help to address and delineate this cell line-dependency as identified factors can be specifically examined in their cellular context. Clinical isolates can be regarded as a tool for identification of viral and cellular components that contribute to RV cell-culture adaptation. Future experiments will be aimed at elucidating the interplay of RV strains with nuclear and extranuclear p53 pools and how a virus coordinates cellular functions to its own advantage.",

Vero cells are negative for the type I interferon response [44], which allows the separation of RV-induced effects on mitochondria-based pathways from effects that are triggered through generation of type I interferons [45].

Each sample was charged with 6 \u03bcL 5 M NaCl and incubated under shaking conditions for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. Finally, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatant was collected as nuclear fraction. Mitochondria-enriched fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation as published [11]. Mitochondrial (30 to 120 \u03bcg/lane) and nuclear (20 \u03bcg/lane) fractions were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane for detection with primary (anti-VDAC antibody was diluted 1:2000, all other antibodies 1:200) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies as described [11]. Equivalent protein loading in the mitochondrial and nuclear fraction was monitored with VDAC and histone 2B (H2B), respectively.",

The release of pro-apoptotic CytC promotes the formation of the so-called apoptosome consisting of apoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf-1), pro-caspase 9 and CytC. Effector caspases can be inhibited by the pan-caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Application of NIM811 can inhibit cyclophilins such as CypD and Cyp40 as examined in this study.
