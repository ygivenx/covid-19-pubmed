            "text": "In tandemly repeated gene families, in which all members share a common function, there is a tendency for concerted evolution that is characterised by homogenisation of gene sequences [1]. Classical examples include the histone and ribosomal RNA genes. In such cases the expansion of gene families is driven by selection for high expression [2]. Concerted evolution is generally maintained by unequal crossover, intergenic gene conversion or other illegitimate recombination mechanisms [1,2]. Conversely, there are multigene families whose members encode diverse functions e.g. genes encoding immunoglobulin (Ig), T cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins [1]. Such diversity occurs when there is less homogenisation than mutation, due to the evolution of specific programmed mutational mechanisms [3]. In addition, more complex modes exist; for example, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (VH) genes encode proteins with identical functions, but exhibit little concerted evolution [4]. Instead, their evolution is governed by divergence and a birth-and-death process of gene duplication and dysfunctioning mutations [2].",

            "text": "Similar to other families of highly expressed trophoblast-specific genes such as the pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) [5], the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins, which are the most abundant foetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream during human late pregnancy, are encoded by multiple tandemly arrayed genes [6,7]. The PSG family of glycoproteins, with the related CEA-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) proteins, are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily [8]. The Ig domain structure of the human and mouse PSGs differs, as follows: Human PSGs contain one V-like Ig domain (N), C2-like Ig domains (A and B) and relatively hydrophilic tails (C), with domain arrangements classified as type I (N-A1-A2-B2-C), type IIa (N-A1-B2-C), type IIb (N-A2-B2-C), type III (N-B2-C) and type IV (A1-B2-C) [9]. In contrast, mouse PSGs typically have three or more N domains followed by a single A domain [7,10]. The common ancestor of rodent and primate PSGs and CEACAMs was probably similar to CEACAM1, which is the only CEA family member with an identical gene structure in the human, rat and mouse that encodes all types of extracellular domains present in CEACAM and PSG proteins. The time of initial gene duplication is estimated at 90 Myr [11], approximately the time of rodent-primate divergence. The independent expansion of human and mouse PSG gene families occurred through further gene duplication and exon shuffling events [7,12,13].",

            "text": "The independent expansion of PSG gene families in rodents and primates indicates convergent evolution, implying that PSG function is conserved. These events can be interpreted in the context of evolutionary theories of parent-offspring and inter-sibling conflicts that promote transcriptional 'arms races' leading to high expression of trophoblast-specific genes that influence maternal investment in offspring [14,15]. In one scenario, duplicated PSG genes are selected because they increase effective PSG dosage, thereby enhancing an effect on maternal investment in offspring. In this context, it is noteworthy that human PSG N domains contain putative integrin-binding 'RGD' motifs that are proposed to mediate cell interactions with the extracellular matrix [16,17] and immune cells [18]. Such PSG-mediated functions could potentially influence trophoblast invasion or maternal immune cell function. However, not all human, and none of the mouse, PSGs contain an RGD motif [7], suggesting that, if human RGD motifs are functionally significant, there has been diversification of function of some human, and all mouse, PSGs, relative to a putative RGD-containing ancestor. In the context of parent-offspring conflict, such divergence might reflect co-evolution of PSGs and their receptors, similar to the co-evolution of ligand / receptor pairs observed in host-pathogen interactions [19,20].",

The only type of domain found in all rodent and primate PSGs is the N domain located at the amino terminus. Indeed, this domain is shared by all members of the extended CEA family, suggesting that it may contain important functional motifs. We sought to test this hypothesis with respect to PSG function, by analysing both full-length PSG sequences and selected domains of possible functional importance. Alignments of full-length 4-domain human and mouse PSG protein sequences were generated with ClustalX, followed by pairwise comparisons of all mouse sequences with all human sequences. Mean Dayhoff PAM250 log scores were calculated for each alignment position and grouped by domain. The scores within each of the four domains were then visualised using box and whisker plots (which show the median value, upper and lower quartiles plus range) (Fig. 1). The N domains exhibited significantly higher scores (p < 0.001) than the other three domains, with positive scores indicating conservation. There was no evidence of interspecies conservation of the other domains, which is unsurprising given the known lack of orthology between human A1 / mouse N2, human A2 / mouse N3, and human B2 / mouse A domain pairs.",

Split decomposition analysis identifies contradictory relationships within alignment data; for example, there may be a pattern grouping PSGX and PSGY together, and another pattern grouping PSGY and PSGZ together [23]. This information is normally approximated when drawing evolutionary trees, however split decomposition is a non-approximation method that permits the building of trees with support indicated for relationships based on all patterns in the data. Such analysis can therefore predict to a limited extent the occurrence of sequence homogenisation e.g. by gene conversion or positive selection.",

For a more complete analysis of N1 domains we also performed the analysis using rat N1 domain exons, all known human N1 domain exons and all known baboon N1 domain exons (Fig. 3). We detected no conflicting signals for mouse Psg N1 domain exons (Fig. 2A), in contrast to the human N domain exons (Fig. 2B). However, our results for human N1 domains (Fig. 3B) differ from those obtained by McLenachan et al. [22] because we observed only two contradictions: i. regarding the relationship of PSG4 and PSG9 to each other, and to their nearest neighbours PSG3 and the common ancestor of PSG6 and PSG10 and, ii. between 'the relationship of PSG2 to PSG1 and PSG11'. This discrepancy is probably due to our inclusion of four extra PSG N1 domain sequences, and the fact that the PSG11 sequence (GenBank: M69025) used by McLenachan et al. [22] has been updated.",

In order to compare the relationship between rodent and primate amino-terminal N domain exon coding sequences, an NJ tree was produced (Fig. 4). The tree was generated from ClustalX alignments of nucleotide sequences, with bootstrapping 1000 times to test the reliability of branches. The human and baboon N sequences formed one distinct cluster, the mouse and rat N1 sequences formed a second, the mouse N2 domains formed a third and the mouse N3 domains formed a fourth. Of particular interest was the split between the ancestral N-type domain and the common ancestor of the N2 and N3 domains. The confidence of this split was 93% and demonstrates that the mouse N1 domains are more closely related to primate N domains than to the mouse N2 and N3 domains. A similar comparison of the entire set of mouse and human PSG domains confirmed that the interspecific N domain clustering is unique because the human PSG A1 and A2 domains segregated into distinct branches (sharing a common ancestor with the mouse A domains) and the B2 domains cluster on a distinct branch (Fig. 5).",

Comparison of the mouse PSG N1 domains identifies the predicted \u03b2-sheet-forming CFG \u03b2-strands as the most variable regions of the N domains (Fig. 7A). The CFG face of CEACAM N domains has been shown to interact with pathogens and mammalian proteins (Fig. 7B). Within Box 1 and Box 2, there is considerable variation between mouse N1 domains, which is illustrated quantitatively using Dayhoff charts (Figs. 8 \u2013 10). Positive Dayhoff scores and generally low standard deviations indicate good conservation of mouse PSG N1 domains (Fig. 8), and even stronger conservation of human PSG N domains (Fig. 9). The latter may be explained by homogenisation of human PSG gene sequences [22]. Dayhoff score analysis using comparisons of all mouse N1 domain versus all human N domain ClustalX aligned sequences gives an indication, at the amino acid level, of the general pattern of evolution of these domains since the rodent / primate divergence (Fig. 10). Again, the majority of residues exhibit good conservation, and relatively little variability is observed between pair-wise comparisons particularly with regard to residues that are involved in protein folding. The reduction in size of Box 2 in Fig. 8 and Fig. 10 is explained by deletions of mouse DNA sequences, requiring exclusion of the corresponding amino acids from the analysis.",

The majority of data points derived from individual comparisons lie under the 45\u00b0 line of equivalence where dn = ds, and most variation in the comparisons lies within the values of ds (Fig. 11A). When the data are presented as box and whisker plots, the values are indicative of conservation, with median values ranging from 0.48 \u2013 0.70 (Fig. 11B).

Nucleotide sequence alignments were generated using all mouse Psg N1 domain exons (based on protein alignments), and the nucleotides present in the three sections comprising the CFG face (Boxes 1, 2 & 3; Fig. 7A) were separated from those comprising the ABED face. The two new sets of data were analysed individually to determine mean dn and ds values from pairwise comparisons of all sequences within each dataset (Fig. 12). A plot of dn vs ds for the ABED face of the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains (Fig. 12A) demonstrates a distribution of pairwise-alignment data points which overwhelmingly lie below the line of equivalence. However, a similar plot generated from analysis of the CFG face has data points distributed approximately equally on both sides of the line of equivalence (Fig. 12B). This is due predominately to a higher number of non-synonymous substitutions. The values of dn/ds obtained for the CFG face in the N1, N2 and N3 domains of the mouse and the N1 domain of the rat are all significantly greater than the values obtained for the ABED face (p < 0.0001, Fig. 12C). The dn/ds values obtained for the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domain CFG faces equal or exceed 1.0, with the highest median value of 1.1 observed in the N1 domain. The rat N1 domains are more conserved, with dn/ds values derived from both the CFG and ABED faces under 1.0 on average.",

The number of most commonly represented tri-groups at each position was expressed as a percentage of the number of aligned sequences, and the mean and standard deviation was determined to indicate the mean maximal tri-group representation for the 50 random alignment positions.

In the former comparison (mouse N1 vs N2 and N3 domains) the most commonly represented tri-group is 4-2-5, with 27% representation. This tri-group is not RGD-like and its representation is lower than the mean maximal tri-group representation of 49.8 \u00b1 22.7% determined for fifty random alignment positions.

Our similar analysis of an expanded set of human PSG sequences revealed a detectable, but less marked, degree of homogenisation. Analysis of mouse N and A domain exons showed that, in general, there is less evidence of purifying selection compared to the human, although there are examples of gene conversions as described previously for the closely related Psg21 and Psg23 genes [12].

However, inspection of mouse PSG N1 domain alignments, and scrutiny of corresponding Dayhoff scores, revealed regions of apparently poor conservation. These regions correspond to the CFG face within the N1 domain of CEACAM1. In the CEACAM family, the CFG face interacts with pathogens and mammalian proteins. Comparisons of dn/ds values obtained from the CFG and ABED faces of mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains confirmed that the CFG face has evolved more rapidly than the ABED face in all three domains. The greatest effect was observed in the N1 domain exon with a doubling of the dn/ds ratio in the CFG face compared with the ABED face. The dn/ds ratio of 1.1 suggests weak positive selection on the CFG face of the N1 domain. The increase in the dn/ds ratio appears to be mainly due to an increase in the dn value, indicative of diversification. The high dn/ds values for the CFG face in the N2 and N3 domains, which are not known to interact with ligands, could be due to a low contribution of these sequences to the structural integrity of the IgV-like domain.",

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that further rat PSG genes may yet be identified because there may be under-representation in the WGS database [26]. Notwithstanding this possibility, there has clearly been ongoing turnover of the PSG gene family in all of the lineages analysed, as there are no known human orthologues of rat and mouse PSGs, and only four potential orthologous relationships between known rat and mouse PSGs.",

Divergence of PSG function is also suggested by differences in the level and developmental timing of expression of different mouse PSGs [7,12], expansion of N domain number in PSG24, PSG30 and PSG31 [7], and loss of secretory signals in PSG32 and in the brain-specific splice variant of PSG16.",

However, a peptide containing the RGD motif from the human PSG9 N domain binds to a receptor on a promonocytic cell line suggesting that some human PSGs may effect their functions through an integrin-type receptor [18]. In this context, the high frequency of the RGD motif on an exposed loop in primate PSG N domains (seven of ten in human and five of fifteen in baboon) may be significant. Rodent PSG N1 domains do not have an RGD motif, but have a high frequency of the RGD-like motifs RGE, HGE and HAE on the CFG face. Under the null hypothesis that these motifs are unlikely to underpin structural integrity of the N1 domain and are therefore free of constraint, our analysis reveals evidence of unexpected conservation of RGD-like motifs in the N1 domain, which have been lost in the N2 and N3 domains. Given the high transition and transversion rates in the N1 domain and the fact that the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains share a common ancestor after the divergence of the rodent / primate lineages, the conservation of RGD-like motifs exclusively in the N1 domain may have functional significance. We note that the RGE motif in the context of the POEM protein induced apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro [29]. We speculate that certain RGE or RGE-like motifs may elicit weak cell attachment, followed by apoptosis \u2013 a combination of properties, reminiscent of snake venom disintegrins [30,31], that could have important functional implications in the context of the extensive tissue remodelling that occurs during placentation [32].",

[41], rat PSG sequences were obtained as described above, human PSG sequences were obtained by name searches at the NCBI Entrez (nucleotide or protein options) database [42] and baboon N1 domain sequences were obtained as described [43]. To generate protein alignments for examination by eye, a Web based ClustalW utility was used [44], otherwise protein sequences were aligned with the ClustalX using the default parameters. Nucleotide alignments were generated based on ClustalX protein alignments, such that where a single dash was placed in the amino acid alignment, three dashes were placed in the equivalent codon position in the nucleotide alignment. The nucleotide alignments were then analysed using SplitsTree version 4b [24] and software and NJ trees were generated from the data (with bootstrapping 1000 times to test the reliability of branches). Individual domains of the mouse PSGs were also analysed by the split decomposition method using the same software. During NJ or Splitstree tree-building, the Jukes-Cantor [45] correction for multiple hits was applied and positions with gaps were ignored.",
