In the first year of life, approximately 15\u201320% of children with RSV will seek medical attention.8 The majority of these children (95%) are treated as outpatients, in primary care physician offices or the emergency department.8 Young age and co-morbidities such as prematurity, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disease, and immunodeficiency are important risk factors for hospitalization,9,10 but determining the severity of disease can be still difficult in young infants and methods often differ among institutions.11 Bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis and currently no standardized methods exist to aid the physician in determining the disposition of a patient. Clinicians commonly rely on parental history, clinical findings and the presence or absence of hypoxemia. Molecular diagnostics have improved our understanding of the viral etiology of bronchiolitis and the common occurrence of viral co-infections,12 but there remains a clinical need for predictive biomarkers that can aid clinicians in the management and disposition of their patients with bronchiolitis.",

Children were enrolled at Texas Children's Hospital from October 2010\u2013April 2011, coinciding with the bronchiolitis season in Houston, TX. Infants with clinical bronchiolitis (wheezing and/or rales with a history of preceding upper airway illness), <24 months of age, and without significant co-morbidities were included.

Samples were stabilized with viral transport media (Iscove media with 15% glycerol) in a 1:1 dilution and refrigerated at 4 degrees before being transported to the Respiratory Virus Diagnostic Laboratory (CLIA ID 45D0919666) at Baylor College of Medicine. At the laboratory, specimens were divided into six aliquots of 0\u00b75\u20131 cc and snap-frozen in an alcohol-dry ice bath and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. NPAs were generally processed within 24 hours of collection. Mucus presence in NPA specimens was evaluated weekly during enrollment by testing for the presence of secretory IgA (sIgA), a major immunoglobulin in mucosal defense, by a captured ELISA method using commercially available reagents 17,18. Only five NPA samples from the enrolled children demonstrated inadequate sIgA levels; these subjects were not resampled.",

The children were either discharged to home or after < 24-hour observation (home), admitted to an acute care unit (ACU), or admitted to a pediatric or neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). Demographic, clinical, virologic, and biomarkers were analyzed with respect to outcome. Ages of participants were categorized into four groups: 0\u20133 , 4\u20136 , 7\u201311 , and 12\u201323 months. Duration of illness prior to presentation was classified into three groups: 0\u20132, 3\u20135 and >5 days. Viral results were categorized as RSV, RV, RSV and RV co-infection, and all other viruses. Virus infection patterns were single viral infection, co- viral infection, and no virus identified. For descriptive statistics, continuous variables were represented as mean (or median), and standard deviation; categorical variables were represented as frequencies or percentages. Demographic characteristics among the groups were compared using chi- square test or Fisher's exact test. Analysis of the laboratory data for the continuous variables NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio compared with demographic data (including disposition) was performed using analysis of variance (anova), Student's t- test, or Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney tests as appropriate. Given the range of values, the log10-transformed values for NW-LDH and NW-caspase 3/7 activity were used for statistical analysis. Correlations were calculated using Pearson's or Spearman's coefficient. For the identification of independent factors that may influence disposition, multivariable logistic regression analyses (polytomous responses) were performed to calculate odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. To identify independent factors that influenced NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7 and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio, multiple linear regression models were developed with two-way interaction effects while controlling for age, gender, race, duration of illness, exposure to cigarette smoke, disposition of patients, virus infection pattern, and the relevant biomarkers.

As an intracellular enzyme released upon cell injury, NW-LDH can be a marker of necrosis or apoptosis. Similar to our prior study,13 RSV infection was associated with higher NW-LDH, and NW-LDH significantly correlated with NW-caspase 3/7. Unlike our prior studies where children with values in the upper quartile had a decreased risk of hospitalization,13,14 in this study an increasing concentration of NW-LDH was associated with an increasing likelihood of hospitalization to either the ACU or ICU. Children admitted to an ICU had significantly higher NW-LDH than children who were sent home or admitted to the ACU. These differences in predicting outcome are not readily explained; however, a higher proportion of this cohort required ICU care, (20\u00b76% versus 6\u00b71%) and none of the children had major co-morbidities compared with 25\u00b72% in Laham et al. study.13 It is possible that our current cohort of children had more severe bronchiolitis, resulting in greater cellular injury to the airway epithelium. Thus, understanding the mechanisms (apoptosis versus necrosis) underlying the release of LDH might improve the prediction of outcomes, with the implication that NW-LDH from cells undergoing dysregulated inflammatory and necrotic processes results in more severe disease while NW-LDH originating from controlled apoptotic antiviral processes results in less severe disease.",

Caspases 3 and 7 are effector caspases that break down intracellular proteins and trigger the apoptotic pathway. We reasoned that children with greater NW-caspase 3/7 activity were more likely to have controlled antiviral pro-inflammatory responses with less severe illness. Previous studies have shown a role for both granulocyte and respiratory epithelial cell apoptosis in antiviral immunity.19 Further, some investigation has shown that incubating RSV with granulocytes inhibits apoptosis in vitro, while a study of RSV positive infants has shown increased granulocyte apoptosis in vivo.20,21 Other studies have highlighted that epithelial cell apoptosis is rare in early disease,22 but predominates in later phases of illness.23 These results suggest appropriate regulation of the apoptotic response is a complex process and influences the severity of disease. In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, we observed that a one-unit increase in NW-caspase 3/7 activity (log10, U/l) was associated with a decreased likelihood to be admitted to the ACU (OR: 0\u00b733, 95% CI: 0\u00b711\u20130\u00b796). This was supported with the NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio: children going home from the ER had significantly lower NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratios compared with hospitalized children (mean \u00b1 SD: 1\u00b701 \u00b1 0\u00b739 versus 1\u00b715 \u00b1 0\u00b748 P = 0\u00b703), possibly reflecting a more balanced innate immune response to the viral pathogen. The relationship between NW-LDH and NW-caspase 3/7 is a crucial finding and suggests that NW-LDH or NW-caspase 3/7 alone may not be sufficient markers, but together can help predict severity of bronchiolitis.",

Our univariate models showed that higher NW-LDH and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio were strongly linked to more severe illness and hospitalization to the ICU and ACU. Interestingly, when multiple linear models were used for the analyses, the age of the subjects in different levels of disposition also greatly impacted the changes of biomarkers. Those children 4\u201312 months of age who were hospitalized to the ACU actually had a lower NW-LDH than those sent home whose ages were greater than 12 months, which had the same trend as the results in our previous studies.13,14 Thus, the demographic interactions should be considered in conjunction with biomarker data when determining severity of illness. Although this study was not aimed toward explaining these underlying associations, a single variable alone may not be sufficient enough to explain what drives the changes of NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio.",

However, this report included a group of children who were older, healthier at baseline, presenting with more varied degree of illness, and had a greater proportion requiring a high level of care. Also, our samples were processed after only one freeze\u2013thaw cycle; samples used for the earlier study underwent multiple freeze\u2013thaw cycles, which may have adversely affected stability of the LDH isoenzymes and or quality of the samples. In our current study, we ensured the quality of our samples by providing feedback in real time on the detection of sIgA in the nasal wash fluid and using nasal wash samples thawed only once for determining LDH and caspase 3/7 activity. Also, in our previous reports, data on NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio was not performed, which we believe helps to explain the dominant cellular pathway (necrosis versus apoptosis) from which LDH derives in respiratory tract fluid. As previously stated, our multiple linear models showed the same inverse relationship between NW-LDH (or NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio) and the severity of bronchiolitis for the children who were admitted to ACU compared with those sent home when taking into account the age of the patients. Overall, our observations over time support the concept that biomarkers such as NW-LDH and NW-caspase 3/7 reflect a complex pathway for control of respiratory viral infections and bronchiolitis disease severity.",

In addition, subjects were recruited as part of two originally separate studies; those subjects recruited from the ICU were sampled within the first 24 hours of admission, but all other patients were enrolled and sampled at the time of presentation to the ER. This may have impacted on NW-LDH activity with higher concentrations detected later into the acute phase of the illness.

Understanding the underlying relationship between LDH, caspase, and the innate immune response to respiratory viral pathogens will likely strengthen this predictive ability. Demographic variables and their interaction effects must also be considered when explaining the biomarkers of interest with respect to outcomes and disposition. The ratio of NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 reflects the innate immune balance between necrosis and apoptosis in controlling disease severity in children presenting with bronchiolitis. Our observations support the hypothesis that during the early immune response to control acute viral respiratory tract infection, an excess of necrosis of epithelial cells from either direct viral replication or a secondary inflammatory response is detrimental to the host versus a regulated apoptotic, antiviral pro-inflammatory pathway of epithelial cells designed to inhibit viral replication and progression of airway injury. Biomarkers like NW-LDH and NW-caspase 3/7 that can help elucidate the pathogenesis of virally induced airway disease will likely serve as good predictive biomarkers in the clinical setting. Further study of LDH, caspase and other biomarkers may reveal novel targets for diagnostic tools that would aid clinicians in management and disposition of children with bronchiolitis.",
