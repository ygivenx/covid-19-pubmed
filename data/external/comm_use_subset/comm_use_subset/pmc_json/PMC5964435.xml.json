Interactions among individuals can aid super-spreading of infectious diseases in humans or animals, and it is usually highest among individuals in close proximity with one another. MERS-CoV was first reported in a 60-year-old man in Bisha area of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 [1]. It has now spread across 27 countries in 4 continents. The most index case-patients have either resided in or have travelled to areas neighbouring the Arabian Peninsula [2]. From the intermittent transmission that had occurred in animal-to-human [1, 3], many human-to-human cases have also been documented within families and healthcare facilities [3\u20137].",

In other words, the source of infection may be the direct or indirect connection [8]. In network analysis, the aim is to identify the most crucial infected patients (also called nodes), who are important in the super-spreading and to use the location of the node in the network to predict which patients (nodes) are likely to be infected [9]. These important patients are influential in that they infect disproportionately large numbers of secondary contacts [10, 11].",

The node \u201cdegree centrality\u201d was used to reveal the most active nodes in the network and how well a node is connected with its neighbours\u2014a node degree is the number of edge incidents on a node. The \u201cbetweenness centrality\u201d was used to measure how many pairs of nodes a node can be connected to through a shortest path, while the \u201ccloseness centrality\u201d was used to measure how contagious an infected patient (a node) is to others [9, 17, 24, 25]. Similarly, \u201c2-reach centrality\u201d was used to explore the proportion of nodes that can reach a given node in 2 steps or less while \u201ceigenvector centrality\u201d was used to measure the importance of a node depending on the importance of its neighbours. Figures 2(a)\u20132(d) provide an illustration of different network centrality metrics.",

High connectivity among healthcare workers and their proximity to MERS cases is not surprising because of the nature of their job. In general, healthcare workers across Saudi Arabia have negative attitude toward MERS infection [34, 35]. Although infectious disease epidemiological plans were put in place in some hospitals, outbreaks of MERS still occurred due to the failure to adhere to the infection control measures [33]. A high proportion of healthcare workers felt at risk of contracting the disease but obliged to care for MERS patients [33, 34]. Similarly, a high percentage of healthcare workers do not feel safe at work using standard precautions [34].",

The most influential node is patient 1664 based on degree centrality. Most of the secondary cases connected to patient 1664 were either attended to by the same healthcare worker(s) or are themselves healthcare workers that attended to patient 1664. Patients who are strongly tied in a network are more likely to be similar to each other than different. Patient 1664 was a 47-year-old female admitted to the hospital with unrelated symptoms [36], and she was associated with 14 healthcare worker cases and 3 household cases because many healthcare staff treated her at the initial stage during her hospitalization in a vascular surgery ward and initially in an open ward, stressing the importance of limiting access to other patients and quarantines.",

Nodes 1522, 1521, 897, 895, and 910 were identified as critical in the spread of MERS to other cases using the betweenness metric. These patients acted as a bridge connecting other smaller secondary cases and thus the spread of MERS infection by further connecting with other secondary cases who also connect other important cases. It was found that the individuals who connect 2 or more separate contacts have an increased likelihood to connect to multiple contacts [37]. Patient 1522 is a 26-year-old female with no comorbidities was linked to three secondary cases and five other indirect offspring.",

The analysis is based on retrospective data rather than prospective data collected from multiple sources which are publicly available. The accuracy of some of the information provided by the patient may not be verifiable especially during the early outbreaks; however, the reporting has been improved upon over the years with coordination between Saudi Ministry of Health and regional WHO office. Similarly, while it is acknowledged that most reported clusters occurred in the hospital as a result of contact tracing, this is not surprising because of adequate monitoring and data collection in the hospital that revealed large secondary cases in the healthcare facilities. Lastly, as in the case of publicly available data, these study data are characterized by missing data. While the problems associated with inference-drawn, publicly available epidemiological data are acknowledged, the results are meaningful and suggest that structure and characteristics of contact network can indeed have significant effect on the rate of transmission of MERS disease.",

They show that real-time network analysis can provide insight into the structure of transmission of infectivity to identify important players for isolation and selective treatment. Moreover, the results present rational estimate of the size of outbreak and the underlying structural characteristics of the group [37]. Patients with high degree of centrality played a powerful role as epidemic attenuators. Patients with high degree of centrality played a powerful role as epidemic attenuators as they are linked to many secondary cases that did not produce any further secondary cases of their own. While patients with high betweenness are epidemic amplifiers, they are a pathway to infect other patients. This study has shown that most important nodes are those within the hospital, and healthcare workers are more prone to the infection. Pathogenic droplets are easily transmitted within the confined areas of hospitals, and control efforts should be put in place at different layers of hospitals. Reducing contact formation especially within the hospital by restricting hospital visitation for MERS patient families and reducing the number of healthcare workers with access to MERS patients will certainly have significant effect on the spread of MERS disease. Saudi Arabia is said to be facing continuous risk of MERS outbreaks [26]. If control measures are not put in place to curtail the number of hospital visitors and movements of nonessential staff within healthcare facility, with their connectivity to people within the community, the disease will speed up further national/international outbreaks. Future research should focus on epidemiological analysis exploring the role of a healthcare facility in the spread MERS disease.",
