            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is mainly transmitted to humans via infected mosquitoes, though other transmission routes, such as through placenta and sexual intercourse, can also occur [1,2]. Recently, the considerable increase in ZIKV infection rates has raised urgent global urgent concerns, especially after the outbreaks in Yap Islands (2007) [3,4], French Polynesia (2013) [5,6], Easter Island (2014) [7], and Brazil (2015) [8,9]. These ZIKV outbreaks were associated with a sharp increase in cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease featured by weakening and paralysis of the limbs and face. In 2015, Zika virus infection spread out to South and Central America, infecting thousands of people in Brazil and Colombia, where it was associated with an increase in GBS rates, as well as a significant increase in severe fetal abnormalities, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, hydranencephaly/hydrops fetalis, and placental insufficiency [10,11,12,13,14]. ZIKV is a small, enveloped positive-strand RNA virus [15]. The genomic RNA of this mosquito-borne flavivirus contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein [16,17]. This polyprotein undergoes co- and post-translational processing to produce three structural proteins, which are capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), and envelope (E), in addition to seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [17,18]. Of the three structural proteins, E is the major surface glycoprotein, containing three domains (I, II, III) and two transmembrane helices [17,18,19]. The majority of flavivirus E proteins upon post-translational modification are modified by N-glycans at amino acid 153/154 within a highly conserved glycosylation motif of N-X-T/S at positions 154\u2013156 (where X is any amino acid except proline) [16]. This is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies and is required for virus entry [20]. ",

            "text": "Previously, it was demonstrated that the N-linked glycosylation sites on the E protein of flaviviruses are highly conserved, playing a vital role in both infectivity and assembly [16,21,22,23]. Loss of N-glycosylation motif on domain I of E protein (N154) results in impaired expression and secretion of E ectodomain from mammalian cells [24,25]. Furthermore, studies in mice have shown that ZIKVs lacking the N-glycans of the ZIKV E were severely compromised for their ability to cause mortality and neuroinvasion, suggesting a vital role for these glycans of the E protein in ZIKV pathogenesis [22,26]. In this study, we utilized mass spectrometry (MS) and a lectin microarray to analyze the structures and composition of glycans on ZIKV E protein from different strains and on the surface of the virus-producing cells, as well as to explore mosquito\u2013human mode of ZIKV transmission and its association to neurological disorders. Importantly, our functional studies show that these N-glycans of the ZIKV envelope glycoprotein are important in viral infection of cells. Our findings might have implications in understanding the roles for these glycan patterns on ZIKV E in virus\u2013host interaction and pathogenic potential. ",

This analysis was performed to better understand the variations in sequences and number of N-Glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where X is any amino acid except proline) between Asian strains (PRVABC59 and FLR isolates), African strains (MR766 and IbH isolates), and a Brazilian isolate from 2016 (SJRP) (Figure 1). Taken together, these analyses indicate that the number and conservation of glycosylation sites vary across different strains. Asian strains (PRVABC59 and FLR isolates) and the Brazilian isolate (BR_SJRP1840) contain five potential N-linked glycosylation sites, whereas the African strain MR766 isolate contains four and IbH isolate contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites. However, phylogenetic tree analysis clearly indicates that the Brazilian isolate (BR_SJRP1840) clusters distinctly from Asian and African strains, denoting differences in the envelope proteins sequences.",

            "text": "Following the production and purification of the different ZIKV strains from various cell lines, the matured virions were pelleted from culture supernatants. The lysed cells and debris were removed by using a brief centrifugation followed by filtering through a 0.45 \u00b5m syringe filter to remove unprocessed viruses. The culture supernatants were further purified, and the pellets were lysed and resolved in 12% bis-tris protein gels and stained with Coomassie Blue (Figure S1). The bands corresponding to the ZIKV E were excised for further identification of E protein-associated N-linked glycan structures using mass spectrometry. The molecular ions in MALDI spectra of envelope protein (E) obtained from purified mature ZIKV virions produced from cell lines of different origin and the predicted glycan structures with the corresponding sizes are shown in Figure 2 (see also Table S1 in the Supplementary Material). The relative abundances of these N-glycans are presented as a heatmap in Figure 3. Although distinct N-glycosylation patterns emerged, the two ZIKV E proteins from African lineage strains, MR766 and IbH, displayed similar N-glycan profiles across the six cell lines that were tested (Figure 2A,B). We observed differential glycosylation patterns between viruses produced from different cell lines. When produced in C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cells, these N-glycan profiles were heavily dominated by sialylated glycans. For these four cell lines, bi- and tri-sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3241.8 m/z and 3603.0 m/z) were the most abundant found on ZIKV E, followed by bi-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary (3964.2 m/z) N-glycans (Figure 2A,B). ZIKV E produced in SNB19 cells was also found to be decorated with Man5 (1579.9 m/z), agalactosylated bisected (1907.1 m/z), core-fucosylated non-sialylated bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z), and core-fucosylated mono-sialylated bi-antennary (2605.5 m/z) N-glycans (Figure 2A,B). When expressed in the LLC-MK2 and JEG-9 cell lines, the N-glycan profiles of MR766 and IbH strains of E were markedly different. When produced in LLC-MK2 cells, bi-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) and core-fucosylated agalactosylated (1836.0 m/z) N-glycans were by far the two most abundant glycan species (Figure 2A,B). More complex N-glycans, with three or more sialic acids and additional lactosamine repeats, were not identified in ZIKV E expressed in LLC-MK2 cells. Finally, the ZIKV E produced in JEG-3 cells revealed a different N-glycosylation pattern between MR766 and IbH strains. While the di- and tri-sialylated N-glycans (2792.5, 3241.8, and 3603.0 m/z) were the most abundant for the MR766 ZIKV E produced in JEG-3, the variety of N-glycans identified in JEG-3 cells was greater, notably including Man5GlcNAc2 (1579.9 m/z), Man6GlcNAc2 (1784.0 m/z), Man7GlcNAc2 (1988.1 m/z), Man8GlcNAc2 (2192.2 m/z), asialo bi-antennary (2070.2 m/z), and core-fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-glycans (Figure 2A). In contrast, the IbH strain produced in the JEG-3 cells displayed a more restricted N-glycan profile, with the notable absence of sialylated N-glycans and with the core-fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-glycan being the most complex N-glycan identified (Figure 2B).",

These data revealed that different cell lines harbor differential cell surface glycosylation (Figure 4). For example, JEG-3 cells exhibit higher levels of sialic acid (measured as binding to MALI, SNA, SSA, TJAI, and ACG lectins) and GlcNac (measured as binding to DSA, LEL, PHAL, and WGA lectins) when compared to other cell lines, especially C6/36 cells.

We employed 3T3/NIH cells (which were originally established from the mouse embryonic fibroblast cells) expressing DC-SIGN (DC-SIGN/3T3 cells) and L-SIGN (L-SIGN/3T3 cells) receptors, along with only 3T3/NIH cells as a control. Cells were infected with ZIKV at a MOI of 1, and the percent infection was determined after 24 h through the use of an immunofluorescence analysis and a high-throughput Operetta imager. As presented in Figure 6, the percentage (%) of infected cells increased in DC-SIGN- and L-SIGN-expressing cells compared to control 3T3/NIH cells, indicating that DC-SIGN- and L-SIGN-expressing 3T3 cells are susceptible to ZIKV infection (Figure 6A). To further confirm the role of high-mannose-type glycans, we performed experiments in the presence of inhibitor/blocker mannan and EDTA. EDTA blocks DC-SIGN by extracting the bound calcium, while Mannan competes with insect-derived high-mannose-type glycans and both inactivate DC-SIGN [31]. Both mannan and EDTA inhibited ZIKV replication efficiently (Figure 6B,C). These results suggest that ZIKV infection efficiency is dependent upon high-mannose-type glycans, and the entry is mediated through DC-SIGN/L-SIGN cell surface expression. Taken together, DC-SIGN/L-SIGN receptors are essential for optimal entry and infection of various strains of ZIKV.",

It is equally important to understand the effect of glycosylation on the biological properties and pathogenesis of the virus, which can be used for designing glycomimetic compounds as potential antiviral agents [32]. In this study, we used MS to characterize the E protein N-glycans of ZIKV derived from insect cells and mammalian cells. We showed for the first time that ZIKV E glycoproteins, which are required for host cell receptor binding, are differentially glycosylated when produced from different cell lines. The N-glycosylation pattern on ZIKV E is thought to be involved in viral infectivity, morphogenesis, protein folding, virus entry, and tissue tropism, among other functions [24,25]. This has also been described for other viruses, including influenza virus [33], HIV-1, West Nile Virus, JEV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Nipah virus, EBOV, and sever acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [34].

Contrasting the four African and Asian lineage viruses, the Brazilian ZIKV isolate SJRP revealed only partial similarities in N-glycosylation. It is believed that the N-linked oligosaccharides in insects cell lines have terminal mannose residues, unlike the N-linked oligosaccharides processed in mammalian cells, because mammalian cells have enzymes that can further process to produce complex N-linked oligosaccharides with terminal sialic acid, glucose, galactose, and other sugars, but, not terminal residue as mannose [36,37]. As DC-SIGN preferentially binds to terminal mannose residues [27,28], one would predict that viruses grown in insect cells would bind to this receptor and infect DCs better than viruses grown in mammalian cells. Despite those differences in N-linked glycan structures, it has been previously shown DENVs derived from both cell lines can efficiently infect DCs because of the presence of unprocessed, high-mannose glycans on the E protein [38,39,40,41]. In our study, SJRP was decorated only with non-sialylated N-glycans when generated in both C6/36 and Vero cell lines; however, mostly with sialylated N-glycans in THP-1, SNB-19, and JEG-3 cells (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4), suggesting that decoration of ZIKV E with sialylated N-glycans may correlate with diverse tissue tropism of the virus. Taken together, these findings lead us to assume that the \u201cN-glycotype\u201d of the recently emergent Asian strains would offer benefit of viral fitness, and would enhance the new neuropathogenic potential of ZIKV infection and also their increased infectivity in mosquitoes.

The N-glycan on DENV E protein that is produced by mammalian cells is a mixture of high-mannose glycan and complex glycan [23,38]. Mosquito cells, by contrast, provide a mix of high-mannose glycan and paucimannose glycan [38]. It has been shown that ZIKV replication in macaques also restores the missing N-glycosylation site (150 loop of the E protein) in MR766 strain [42], suggesting that the passage history (host animal and cell line types) affects the E protein glycosylation pattern of ZIKV strains.

The variation in N-glycans found on ZIKV E ranged from high- (or oligo-) mannose, notably Man5GlcNAc2, to highly sialylated (up to four sialic acids) complex-type N-glycans, and with very few hybrid types. However, both African and Asian lineage strains revealed very similar N-glycosylation patterns of ZIKV E. Di- and tri-sialylated bi- and tri-antennary were the most relatively abundant N-glycans found on ZIKV E when viruses were produced in C6/36 insect cells and LLC-MK2, Vero, THP-1, SNB19, and JEG-3 mammalian cells. High-mannose, asialo-, and agalacto N-glycans were also identified, though in lesser fraction overall relative abundance. The presence of high-mannose and complex-type N-glycans on mammalian cell-derived virus is not only limited to ZIKV, as has been reported earlier for DENV serotypes [38,43], but is the most abundant type of N-glycan found on HIV gp120 glycoprotein [44]. On the other hand, any ZIKV strain when produced in various cell lines showed different N-glycan patterns. Indeed, from a cell line perspective, LLC-MK2 cells produced the same unique N-glycosylation pattern for all five ZIKV E, which were mostly decorated with bi-antennary di-sialylated and core-fucosylated agalactosylated N-glycans (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4; also see Table S1 in the Supplementary Material). Collectively, these findings indicate that not only virus characteristics, e.g., strain or lineage, but also host cell physiology has an impact on the glycosylation pattern of ZIKV E, which may affect viral pathogenesis of ZIKV strains.

These data suggest that the different contexts of specific host cells could significantly affect the N-glycosylation profile of the ZIKV E of different ZIKV strains. The cell culture media, culture conditions, and sequence of a protein may also significantly influence the quality and relative abundance of N-glycans observed on the cell-produced glycoproteins [45,46]. The results of our study also revealed a high heterogeneity in the N-glycans linked to ZIKV E among different ZIKV strains that are produced by the same host cell. For example, Vero cells produced ZIKV E linked to various N-glycans among ZIKV strains, including FRL, IbH, PRVABC59, and MR766. Unlike other flaviviruses, ZIKV E contains a conserved sequence of ~10 amino acids (150 loop of the E protein) that surround the N154 glycosylation site. This conserved sequence may affect the glycosylation process, carbohydrate moiety, and receptor binding site of the ZIKV to host cells [18]. The number and location of glycosylation motifs in the E vary considerably, both between and within flaviviruses [47], altering the pathogenicity of these viruses and the severity of their diseases [22]. The African lineage of ZIKV isolates lack the N-glycosylation site (150 loop of the E protein), while ZIKV isolates from recent outbreaks in South and Central American regions, that originated from the epidemy of Asian lineage ZIKV PF-2013 in French Polynesia in 2013, contain the glycosylation site within the viral envelope [22]. Indeed, in a previous study, the recombinant ZIKV strains that lack the glycosylation site were unable to induce mortality in a mouse model [22]. However, recent studies have revealed that residues surrounding the ZIKV E protein glycan regulate virus antigenicity, irrespective of the presence of a glycan [48]. The glycosylation of ZIKV E protein does not affect antibody binding to a nearby epitope or its capacity to serve as a neutralization target [49]. Collectively, these findings suggest that ZIKV pathogenicity, but not immunogenicity, might be influenced by the glycosylation of the E protein, which occurs post-translationally in ER of the host cell. This host cell-dependent glycosylation process of ZIKV E could thus have wide implications on pathogenicity and infectivity of the virus. However, future research is required to evaluate the full extent of this circumstance. ",

            "text": "In regard to virus\u2013host cell infection, in this study, we explored ZIKV interactions with cellular lectins that bind specific types of glycans we identified on the virus. DC-SIGN is a lectin-like molecule, expressed in dendritic cells and moncocytes that can facilitate virus entry through its binding affinity with the glycans on the E protein of flaviviruses [50]. Similar to most flaviviruses, N154 glycosylation was found to play a role in ZIKV infection of mammalian cells through this entry factor DC-SIGN [51,52] For DENV, DC-SIGN interacts directly with the additional N67-glycan (which is absent in other flaviviruses) on viral E protein. Indeed, the glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) of C-type lectins, including DC-SIGN, have a binding affinity as an attachment factor for host cell entry of ZIKV similar to other pathogenic flaviviruses [53]. We also observed a significant decrease in ZIKV infection in DC-SIGN- and L-SIGN-expressing cells in the presence of competitive inhibitors rich in mannose. As a result, the presence of monoclonal antibodies to various C-type lectins, the competitive inhibitors rich in mannose, or antiviral gene therapy may be able to reduce ZIKV replication by impairing the binding between viral N-glycan of E protein and GAGs of DC-SIGN. Recent studies suggest that the cells expressing DC-SIGN, such as human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells, are permissive to the most recent ZIKV isolates [54]. Taken together, our results may partially explain the alterations in the mechanisms of pathogenesis and tissue tropism of these recent ZIKV strains. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of host glycosylation variability on ZIKV pathogenesis and infectivity in vivo. ",

To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive mapping on the glycome of ZIKV E in different physiologically relevant cell lines. Our study shows that the N-glycans linked to ZIKV E produced by both insect and various mammalian cells are highly heterogeneous in structure and composition. Both African and Asian lineage strains showed very similar N-glycosylation patterns of ZIKV E. We also noticed that the N-glycan pattern of the ZIKV E depends on not only virus strain characteristics, but also on cell line type. We showed that ZIKV infection in DC-SIGN- and L-SIGN-expressing cells was significantly decreased in the presence of competitive inhibitors rich in mannose, suggesting an important role for these lectin-like molecules as cell entry factors in pathogenesis, potentially emerging new strains of ZIKV and alternative targets for therapeutic development. The results of this study may be important in efforts to design therapeutically active antibodies against ZIKV replication and glycomimetic compound-based antivirals.",
