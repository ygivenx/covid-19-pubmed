Currently, the two commercially available prophylactic vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, based upon virus-like particles (VLP) derived from the major capsid protein L1 effectively protect against infection by the two most common HPV types found in cervical cancer (for review see [1]). The minor capsid antigen L2 also shows promise for preventive vaccination in animal models, although it is less immunogenic than L1 VLP. However, neither L1 VLP nor L2-based vaccines generate therapeutic effects against established HPV infection [2]. Therefore, given the significant burden of HPV-associated lesions worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic HPV vaccines for the control of existing HPV infection and associated malignancies. Quite different from preventive vaccines which target the viral capsid proteins L1 and/or L2, therapeutic HPV vaccines focus on targeting the HPV E6 and E7, since only these oncoproteins are consistently expressed in HPV-associated cancers and are responsible for the malignant transformation.",

Naked DNA is relatively safe, stable, and easy to produce and transport (for review see [3]). Furthermore, DNA vaccines are capable of sustained cellular gene expression, promote MHC class I antigen presentation, and have the capacity for repeated administration since they do not lead to the generation of neutralizing antibodies. However, an important limitation of DNA vaccines is limited potency since they lack the intrinsic ability to amplify and spread in vivo. Therefore, it is important to consider strategies to improve DNA vaccine potency strategies (for review, see [4, 5]).",

This phenomenon likely reflects the efficient recognition of calreticulin by dendritic cells and improved targeting to the MHCI pathway by targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum [6].",

Although the fusion of E7 with CRT enables such DNA vaccines to elicit significant E7-specific CD8 T cell immunity in the absence of CD4 T cell help [12], approaches to boost CD4+ T cell help are likely to enhance DNA vaccine potency. Indeed, CD4+ T cells play a significant role in priming effector CD8+ T cells, thus augmenting the CD8+ T cell responses, as well as generation of memory T cell populations (for review see [13]). CD4+ T cells help to differentiate na\u00efve CD8+ T cells into effector cells by providing activation signals to dendritic cells (DCs), most notably IL-2, thus promoting CD8+ T cell proliferation. Thus, strategies to induce CD4+ T helper cells at sites of CD8+ T cell priming can potentially enhance CTL immune responses.",

            "text": "In the current study, we aim to combine intracellular targeting strategies using CRT with a strategy to enhance CD4+ T help for the development of a therapeutic HPV DNA vaccine. Since papillomavirus L1 or L2 antigens likely contain CD4+ T cell epitopes [14\u201318], we reasoned that co-administration of vectors containing codon-optimized bovine papillomavirus (BPV) L1 and L2 may provide CD4+ T cell help and enhance the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by DNA vaccines. An additional potential benefit would be the induction of neutralizing antibody and protective immunity [19, 20]. We showed that co-administration of vectors containing BPV L1 or L2 DNA in combination with DNA vaccines could elicit enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ in both CRT/E7 and ovalbumin (OVA) antigenic systems. We also demonstrated that co-administration of vectors containing BPV1 L1 \u00b1 L2 DNA with CRT/E7 DNA led to the generation of L1/L2-specific CD4+ T cell immune responses as well as L1-specific neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we showed that co-administration with BPV1 L1 significantly enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. In addition, the observed enhancement of CD8+ T cell immune responses by DNA encoding L1 and L2 was also found to extend to HPV-16 L1/L2 system. Overall, our data suggest that co-administration of DNA encoding papillomavirus L1 or L2 can be used to enhance antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination for the control of HPV infection and HPV-associated tumors. Furthermore, our approach can also generate neutralizing antibodies against papillomavirus for potential prevention against infection. This strategy also provides the opportunity to combine preventive and therapeutic approaches. Our strategy may potentially be extended to other antigenic systems for the control of infection and/or cancer.",

To further promote clinical translation, subsequent investigations focusing on directly characterizing the antitumor effects of co-administrating HPV16 L1 with CRT/E7, and whether reversing the sequence of HPV16 L1 abolishes the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response enhancement should be conducted. In addition, since our vaccination regimen achieved complete tumor suppression, the frequency of vaccination may be modified and further studied to determine the optimal vaccination regimen.

Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that papillomavirus VLPs can directly activate dendritic cells and thereby increase expression of costimulatory markers and MHC class I and II molecules [26\u201328]. Thus, the co-administration of L1 DNA may lead to the local activation of DCs, resulting in further enhancement of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by DNA vaccination.

            "text": "The BPV1 L1, L2 and HPV L1, L2 pseudovirions with encapsulated secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) were generated by co-transfection of 293TT cells with plasmids encoding BPV1 L1, L2 or HPV L1 and L2 and a SEAP reporter plasmid as described previously [33]. Cells collected after transfection were treated overnight with Brij 58 (0.5 %), Benzonase (0.5 %) and purified by centrifugation on an Optiprep step gradient (27, 33, and 39 %) at 40,000 rpm for 4.5 h. Pseudovirus neutralization assays were carried out as outlined previously [34]. Briefly, the pseudovirus and the pooled mouse immune sera were incubated for 1 h and the mixture was used to infect 293TT cells. 68\u201372 h post-infection, the supernatants were collected and SEAP activity in the supernatants was measured by colorimetric assay. Serum neutralization titers were defined as the highest dilution that caused at least a 50 % reduction in SEAP activity, compared to control pre-immune serum samples.",
