If systematic monitoring is in place, key parameters such as R0, the basic reproductive number [1], can be estimated directly, as in the case of the foot and mouth disease outbreak among British cattle in 2001 [3] and the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia in 2002 and 2003 [4]. Genetic analysis provides a window into the epidemic history of a pathogen that can complement epidemiological analysis, as in the case of the H1N1 influenza A pandemic in 2009 [5,6], or take its place in the absence of reliable surveillance data. The ability to sequence pathogen genomes in real time, for example during the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti [7], foretells of the increasingly important role for genetic analysis during outbreak response.",

It commonly involves the post hoc interpretation of an evolutionary tree constructed from genetic sequences. Relationships between isolates may reveal the order of transmission events [10,11], whereas the shape of the tree is informative about overarching dynamics [12]. However, more powerful approaches explicitly integrate genetic and epidemiological models. For example, coalescent methods\u2014which can be used to infer historical changes in population size [13\u201315]\u2014have been applied to pathogen populations to infer historical changes in prevalence. By modelling changes in prevalence using the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013susceptible (SIS) model, epidemiological parameters such as the intrinsic growth rate of the epidemic have been estimated directly [16].",

HCV is a major cause of liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Estimated to infect 160 million people around the world [17], it is implicated in 350 000 deaths per year [18]. Sharing contaminated needles and transfusion of infected blood products are thought to be the main routes of transmission [19]. HCV is an enormously diverse RNA virus, comprising six major types with varying geographical distributions [20,21]. Coalescent inference has been used to date the origin of HCV in different countries [16,22\u201328], providing a historical context for the emergence of epidemics and providing quantitative support for the roles of iatrogenic transmission [22] and drug use [29].",

However, theoretical work has shown that although the central assumption of coalescent approaches\u2014that effective population size is proportional to prevalence\u2014is valid at dynamic equilibrium [31], it does not hold more generally [32,33]. In this study, we derive a new framework for population genetic inference of epidemiological dynamics based on a metapopulation model of pathogen populations. Using coalescent results for metapopulations [34,35], we expose the assumptions implicit to coalescent approaches and explore the limits of genetic inference. We implement SI, SIS and SIR models in BEAST [36], and conduct a meta-analysis investigating the epidemiological processes that underlie differences in genetic diversity between HCV epidemics.",

Migration to a colonized deme corresponds to secondary infection of an infected host. To make a concrete population genetics model, additional assumptions are required [34,35,41], principally that (i) upon primary infection the infecting genotypes come from a single host, and (ii) the carrying capacity is immediately attained within the newly infected host.",

In a series of papers, Wakeley [44\u201346] developed coalescent approximations for structured populations, including metapopulations [34,35], based on the assumption that the number of colonized demes is large. The main result from his work is that under disparate, complex models of population structure, the genealogy of individuals sampled from different demes is well approximated by a standard coalescent process whose effective population size is a function of the demographic parameters. This puts inference for metapopulations on a practical footing [36], and the assumption that the number of infected hosts is large is consistent with the deterministic compartmental models commonly used in epidemiology.",

This is known as strong proportionate mixing [1]. In the SIS model, infected individuals clear infection and return to the susceptible class at rate \u03b3. In the SIR model, individuals that recover from infection instead become immune. These three models have different dynamics, with the SIR model producing the classical epidemic expansion and burn out (figure 1).",

During this exponential phase, the transmission rate per infection is \u03b21, but it slows as susceptible hosts are exhausted. The clearance rate \u03b3 corresponds to the inverse of the average duration of infection. An important quantity is the basic reproductive number R0, defined as the total number of infections caused by an index case in a totally susceptible population [1].

Although this is important for the metapopulation model, our treatment of secondary infection does not change the dynamics of the epidemiological models. As noted, the use of deterministic differential equations to model epidemic dynamics implies the number of infected hosts is large. Although this cannot hold in the early stages of the epidemic, experience suggests these models are nevertheless useful for epidemiological inference [3\u20135].",

However, the growth curves describing changes in Ne are simpler than the underlying growth curves that describe changes in prevalence, and have one fewer parameter. Consequently, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the coalescent parameters and the epidemiological parameters, meaning that the epidemiological parameters cannot be fully identified from genetic analysis alone. An independent estimate of one of the epidemiological parameters (e.g. rate of clearance of infection or present-day prevalence) is required to reconstruct historical changes in prevalence. In this respect, our results differ from Pybus et al. [16], but we agree with their key result that the intrinsic growth rate (r0) in an SIS model can be estimated by modelling changes in Ne using a logistic growth curve. We also agree that to estimate the basic reproductive number R0, an independent estimate of one of the epidemiological parameters is needed.",

However, we excluded those with small sample size (fewer than 20 sequences) and evidence of recombination (see the electronic supplementary material, table S2).

We found that the strongest predictor of diversity was the age of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), followed by population density and subtype (figure 3). Table 1 shows the regression coefficients and p-values, although the latter must be viewed with a degree of caution owing to pseudo-replication within subtypes. The overall predictive power of the regression was very high (R2 = 98.9%). Epidemics with older TMRCA had substantially higher diversity as would be expected, whereas increased population density predicted a reduction in diversity. Of the subtypes represented by multiple datasets, 1b had highest diversity and 6a had lowest diversity after correcting for the effects of TMRCA and population density. Surprisingly, there was no significant relationship between diversity and intrinsic growth rate, r0, after taking into account other factors. This would be explained by rapid epidemic growth across the datasets, resulting in star-shaped genealogies.\n\n",

We obtained similar estimates of R0 in the three epidemics (1.2\u20131.4), although there was substantial uncertainty. This value is considerably lower than previous estimates, largely because the duration of the infectious period that we estimated (1.2\u20131.6 years) was substantially shorter than the 10\u201330 years that have previously been supposed [16]. Estimating short infectious periods for hepatitis C is surprising in view of the nature of the disease, which is chronic in 80 per cent of people and has lifelong infectivity [17,18].

The Argentinean and Hong Kong epidemics appear to have been introduced originally by migration [54,61], while both the Hong Kong and Thai epidemics emerged relatively recently. Dynamical modelling shows that the number of infectious individuals falls when the number of susceptible individuals becomes exhausted. Why this should occur more quickly in these epidemics than the global subtype 1a and 1b outbreaks is unclear, but may depend on mode of transmission, the behaviour of risk groups, local competition between subtypes and virological differences.",

Another of our assumptions, that co-infection is absent, is likely to prove more difficult to overcome. When there is co-infection, recombination can occur.

When there is no more than a single pathogen sequence per host, as we assumed here, longitudinal sampling is straightforward to account for using the standard technique [70] as implemented in BEAST, with no adjustments necessary to the model. When there are multiple pathogen sequences per host, the genealogy of the metapopulation is conceptually divided into the scattering and collecting phases [34], which correspond informally to within- and between-host evolution, respectively.

One of the benefits of implementing our approach in BEAST is that this complexity can be readily incorporated in future analyses. There has been considerable variation in the estimates of the molecular clock rate in HCV [72]. We assumed a clock rate of 0.58 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year, which was estimated for the NS5B gene [73], and was previously applied to a number of the datasets we analysed. However, there is evidence to suggest that the rate may be closer to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 per site per year [26,72]. The effect of underestimating the clock rate would be to systematically overestimate the dates of events during the epidemic history, while overlooking uncertainty and heterogeneity in the clock rate will cause the credible intervals for some of our parameters and dates to be anti-conservative.",

The SI, SIS and SIR models may be caricatures of true epidemiological dynamics, but they capture key features of epidemic processes, including exponential, plateau and burn-out phases. In this study, we directly compared the goodness-of-fit of endemic, SI, SIS and SIR models. In practice, a useful approach might be to include the non-parametric Bayesian skyline plot [74] in the model comparison [72]. This would allow rejection of the parametric models if none adequately described the population history of the sample.

In stochastic models, \u03b21 and \u03b3 and therefore R0 can, in principle, be deconfounded, but if deterministic models are any guide, precise estimates cannot be expected unless additional information is available concerning, for example, the rate of clearance or prevalence. Fortunately, r0 will often be a convenient proxy for R0 because it exhibits the same threshold behaviour: when r0 \u2265 0 (equivalently, R0 \u2265 1), the infection persists in the population and when r0 < 0 (equivalently, R0 < 1), the epidemic dies out.

We used a simple permutation test based on the correlation between physical distance and three measures of linkage disequilibrium (r2, |D\u2032| and G4), implemented as part of omegaMap [75]. We excluded a dataset if the null hypothesis of no recombination was rejected at the 5 per cent level by any of the three tests. This is not unduly conservative because of the similarity between the measures of linkage disequilibrium. Details of all 28 datasets are available in the electronic supplementary material, text S2. We performed multiple sequence alignment using the Geneious alignment tool [76] to produce a global alignment of all sequences and where an alignment was not available between sequences within the same dataset.

In all three models, the proportion of infected hosts is assumed to increase at rate \u03b21SI, where \u03b21 is the primary transmission coefficient. In the SIS model, hosts clear infection and return to the susceptible class at rate \u03b3. In the SIR model, hosts that clear infection recover and are no longer susceptible.
