In temperate countries, predictable winter epidemics occur, but transmission dynamics in tropical settings are more irregular. For many decades, influenza was thought not to be a disease of importance in tropical countries. This has changed considerably in the last 10 years.3 Research efforts are ongoing to increase knowledge and understanding of how tropical transmission influences global influenza transmission. Vietnam, as one of the most populous countries in the tropics, is a potentially globally important site for influenza dynamics, both for its possible contribution to global virus evolution4, 5 and as a high\u2010risk environment for the emergence of potentially pandemic strains such as highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1.",

As national surveillance programmes 6, 7 have focused largely on hospital sites, estimates from these studies are likely to underestimate true clinical burden and attack rates in the community. Seasonal influenza vaccine is not currently provided through public health services in Vietnam and there is minimal, although increasing, use in the private sector.13 The optimal vaccination strategy for seasonal influenza in Vietnam is still to be established.14\n",

This was consistent with previous national hospital\u2010based surveillance which demonstrated asynchronous peaks and co\u2010circulation of different strains.6, 8 Our surveillance results were also consistent with data showing that the northern subtropical regions of Vietnam have a more predictable seasonality than the tropical central and southern regions.23 Heterogeneity in transmission patterns within tropical region is increasingly being recognised.24 Vietnam has one the longest and lowest \u201cpeaks\u201d when considered nationally, and the results of this study suggest that much of this is driven by the transmission dynamics in the south of the country. This study reports higher rates of influenza positivity in ILI than are generally described globally and fewer periods where no influenza was detected.24, 25, 26 Attack rates measured through clinical settings are vulnerable to differences in healthcare seeking behaviour.27 Influenza B is typically considered to cause less severe symptoms than influenza A H3N228 meaning that people are admitted less frequently and not detected through inpatient surveillance systems. This could give an impression of smaller outbreak size despite considerable community transmission.29, 30, 31 Influenza B was found to occur in a similar number of weeks to influenza A H3N2 but almost 100 fewer cases were detected.",

There is no public provision for influenza vaccination in Vietnam, and prior to 2009, the use in the general public was very rare with less than 1% of the population reporting previous vaccination.13 In the present study, 5% of individuals who presented to private clinics reported receiving vaccination compared to only 1.2% those who attended the hospital outpatient clinic. However, only a single individual who reported having received vaccination had a recommended indication. The increase in vaccination rates detected through this study confirms the importance of defining the appropriate vaccination strategy for tropical Vietnam.38 Antibiotic use prior to enrolment was high in all groups. Antibiotics can easily be purchased in pharmacies across Vietnam without prescription.39 Most ILI have a viral aetiology and given the short time before presentation in this study, it is unlikely that individuals have developed a secondary bacterial infection; ILI may be a major cause of inappropriate antibiotic use in this setting. Antibiotic resistance in Vietnam is an issue, as it is globally, education of medical professionals, pharmacists and the public about the appropriate use of antibiotics is urgently required.40\n",
