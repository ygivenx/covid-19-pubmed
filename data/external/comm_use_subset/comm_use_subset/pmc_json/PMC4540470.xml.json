            "text": "Schistosomiasis is one of the most serious parasitic diseases and affects more than 200 million people globally, based on conservative estimates [1,2]. Schistosomiasis is caused mainly by three Schistosoma species: Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni, and Schistosoma haematobium. S. japonicum is endemic in Asia, principally China and the Philippines, whereas S. mansoni and S. haematobium are distributed in Africa and the Middle East. S. mansoni is also prevalent in South America [3]. Schistosomes have a complex developmental life cycle and exhibit sexual dimorphism. The life cycle comprises seven morphologically discrete stages (i.e., egg, miracidium, mother sporocyst, daughter sporocyst, cercaria, juvenile schistosomulum, and adult worm), complicating the control and prevention of schistosomiasis [4]. In contrast to the other two Schistosoma species known to infect humans, S. japonicum is a true zoonotic parasite that utilizes a wide range of mammalians as definitive hosts, including bovines, mice, rabbits, goats, pigs, and dogs [5,6].",

Schistosomes derived from different mammalian hosts also exhibit visible changes in morphology, such as the length and width of worms, tegument, sucker and gynoecophorus [7,8]. In the last decade, a number of gene expression profiling studies of schistosomes have been conducted using various analytical approaches, and the findings have tremendously facilitated improved understanding of the molecular basis of schistosome developmental biology, host-parasite interactions and the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis (see more in reviews [9\u201311]). The majority of schistosomes used in those studies were isolated from laboratory animals such as BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, and New Zealand white rabbits.",

            "text": "Recently, numerous differentially expressed genes that may influence parasite survival and development were identified by comparative proteomic analyses [12] and microarray analysis [13] of schistosomula from susceptible BALB/c mice, less susceptible Wistar rats and resistant reed voles. Yang et al. comparatively analyzed the gene expression profiles of S. japonicum derived from natural reservoir host yellow cattle, goats and water buffaloes using microarrays, and suggested that the gene expression patterns of some genes in schistosomes in natural hosts and laboratory animals may be diverse [7,8]. Data obtained using laboratory animals may not be completely transferable to natural hosts. A comparison of the gene expression profile of S. japonicum in its natural reservoir hosts and laboratory animals will undoubtedly facilitate our understanding of parasite biology. Previous epidemiological studies have revealed that bovines, particularly water buffaloes, are the major natural reservoir of S. japonicum and play a vital role in schistosomiasis transmission in China [14\u201317]. Therefore, we performed comparative analyses of the gene expression profiles of S. japonicum from the natural reservoir host, water buffalo, with those from laboratory animal mice and rabbits using a genome-wide microarray approach. Our results will be of significance for the screening of anti-schistosome targets and vaccine candidates using laboratory animals to further facilitate the control of schistosomiasis in natural reservoir hosts in endemic areas.",

The design and construction of the microarray and the methods used in microarray hybridization and feature extraction have been previously reported [19\u201321]. The full details of this schistosome microarray design have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus public database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under platform accession number GPL18617. Briefly, a total of 21,861 target sequences (20,194 sequences derived from S. japonicum and 1667 sequences derived from S. mansoni) were provided to Roche NimbleGen for array design. For each sequence, 3 or 4 60-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed. Probes with random sequences were printed as negative control (background signal) and eight spike-RNA probes from the intergenic sequence of yeast as hybridization controls. The microarray was manufactured by Roche NimbleGen. Microarrays were printed in a 12\u00d7135 K feature format. cDNA was labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy3-dCTP) using cRNA Amplification and Labeling Kit (CapitalBio, Beijing, China). Hybridization was performed using three biological replicates for all samples at CapitalBio. Procedures of array hybridization, washing, scanning, and data acquisition were carried out according to the NimbleGen Arrays user\u2019s guide. The arrays were scanned using MS200 scanner (NimbleGen Systems) with 2 \u03bcm resolution, and NimbleScan software (NimbleGen) was used to extract fluorescent intensity raw data from the scanned images. The normalized expression data of genes was generated using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm [22\u201324], which consisted of three steps: a background adjustment, quantile normalization and final summarization. The outlier probes were identified and the contribution of outlier probes was reduced in the reported gene expression level, which has been demonstrated to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of microarray results. Then, the expression value of a gene is a weighted average of all probes when both background correction and quantile normalization were performed. Raw data and normalized gene level data from the arrays have been deposited at the public database Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE65327. Genes were considered differentially expressed by expression fold-change (FC) \u22652 between any two compared worm samples and p<0.05 (Student\u2019s t-test). The stably and abundantly expressed genes among the adult worms from the four mammalian hosts were extracted using coefficient of variation (CV) \u22640.1 and fluorescence intensity \u226510,000 on the basis of retrieval of a panel of well characterized Schistosoma genes of which the intensity values were greater than 10,000. Hierarchical clustering analysis of selected genes was performed to generate heat maps using the software Cluster 3.0 [25] and Heatmap Builder 1.0 [26].",

CD-HIT v4.5.4 software (http://www.bioinformatics.org/cd-hit/) was then used to eliminate redundant protein sequences from the obtained putative SjVALs using the criteria of 95% identity and 80% coverage between two sequences. Finally, all remaining protein sequences were confirmed by the presence of SCP/TAPS-representative protein domains (IPR014044) using InterProScan [31]. A phylogenetic relationship tree was built using the full-length amino acid sequences of Schistosoma VALs in the following steps. First, sequences were aligned using ClustalX [36] and then refined manually, and a phylogenetic tree was finally generated using MEGA 5.0 software [37] by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method (the bootstrap test was performed with 1000 replicates).",

Similar results were obtained by correlation analyses of biological replicates for the global expression profiles of schistosomes from water buffaloes, yellow cattle and goats [7,8]. We then investigated the transcriptional profile correlation between worm samples from different hosts using an average of three biological replicates.

            "text": "Comparative genomics analysis of well characterized signaling pathways between schistosome and mammalian host indicates that schistosome genome encodes various growth factors, receptors and other critical components to regulate numerous cellular processes during tissue development and organogenesis. These components share high sequence similarity with mammalian orthologues, implying that schistosomes may utilize host components as developmental signals besides their own pathways [33]. The KEGG pathway analysis showed that many of these differentially expressed genes were involved in signaling transduction pathways, such as calcium signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway (Table 3). Previous studies has also found that genes involved in ErbB signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway were differentially expressed in worms from buffaloes and goats [8]. Moreover, the S. japonicum genome reveals that schistosomes are not able to de novo synthesize fatty acids, sterols, purines, essential amino acids, which must be acquired from their hosts. Analysis of the KEGG pathways assigned to metabolic process indicated that these differentially expressed genes mainly participated in amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism (Table 3), which is consistent with the findings of Yang et al. [7]. All the results above further prove that schistosomes can exploit host nutrients and signaling pathways for growth and development, and host environments can affect the survival and development of the parasites. For instance, human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which acts as a plasma Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, is an anti-coagulation protein that plays an important role in the regulation of the blood coagulation cascade [38]. Interestingly, the S. japonicum TFPI gene (CAX69506.1) was significantly up-regulated in the intra-mammalian stage of the parasite life cycle and variously expressed in schistosomes from different hosts (S1 Fig). It will be engrossing to investigate the function of the TFPI gene in schistosomes in connection with the blood parasitic environment. Notably, one trematode eggshell synthesis protein gene (TES, pfam08034), AAW25913.1, was significantly up-regulated in worms from C57BL/6 mice, buffaloes and rabbits comparing with those from BALB/c mice. The trematode eggshell synthesis protein genes have been identified in several trematode parasites, which are crucial for eggshell synthesis, a key step for determining the quality and quantity of eggs laid [39]. Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins, and members of this family have been identified in major eukaryotic phyla [40]. In humans, annexins interact with various cell-membrane components by forming networks on the membrane surface that are involved in the regulation of membrane organization, cell differentiation and migration, intracellular signaling by enzyme modulation and ion fluxes [40\u201342]. Although annexins lack signal peptides for secretion, some extracellular members have been identified that act as receptors for serum proteases on the endothelium as well as inhibitors of neutrophil migration and blood coagulation [40]. In addition, some human annexin isoforms are involved in immunoregulatory functions such as the resolution of inflammation [43]. In S. mansoni, three annexin genes (Smp_074140, Smp_074150 and Smp_077720) have been identified by proteomic analysis as the membrane-associated constituents of the tegument surface [44]. Of the annexins, Smp_077720 is significantly up-regulated in the transition from free-living cercaria to parasitic schistosomulum and adult worm and binds to the tegument surface membranes in a calcium-dependent manner [45]. We identified three annexin domain-containing protein genes (AAX26603.2, CAX70178.1 and AAP06415.1) that were differentially expressed in schistosomes from the four different mammalian hosts. AAX26603.2 and CAX70178.1 were significantly up-regulated in worms from BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice compared with worms from buffaloes and rabbits, but the opposite expression pattern was observed for AAP06415.1 (Fig 3). This result indicates that these genes are either under different regulatory mechanisms or that the encoded proteins are functionally different. In addition, a gene coding for a putative endoribonuclease (AAX27316.2) containing the conserved endoribonuclease XendoU domain was significantly up-regulated in schistosomes from mice compared with those from buffaloes and rabbits. XendoU, which was first identified in Xenopus laevis, is a U-specific, metal ion-dependent endoribonuclease and is involved in the processing of intron-encoded small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) [46\u201348]. Schwarz et al. recently determined that the calcium-dependent endoribonuclease XendoU promotes endoplasmic reticulum network formation through local RNA degradation [49].",

Sequence alignment analysis revealed that these genes shared no sequence similarity to any sequence present in the non-redundant protein sequence (nr) databases of NCBI at a cut-off E value of 10\u22125 (except for Schistosoma species). Thus these Schistosoma-specific genes are likely specialised for parasitism by schistosomes, although their functions are unknown. Here, we identified a panel of four Schistosoma-specific genes (AAW25097.1, AAW27175.1, AAW24713.1 and CAX69761.1) that encoded a putative signal peptide and were overexpressed in worms from mice compared with those from buffaloes and rabbits. These four genes also exhibited a similar expression pattern among different developmental stages: significant down-regulation in the transition from free-living cercaria to parasitic schistosomulum and adult worm, and no expression in the egg stage (worms isolated from rabbits) (Fig 6). The intriguing expression patterns of these Schistosoma-specific genes spark interests in further characterization of their function and their potential contribution to successful parasitism.",

A list of selected genes with various functions is presented in Fig 7. The gene annotation results revealed that many of these stably and abundantly expressed genes are conventional housekeeping genes, some of which have been proved to be constitutively expressed across the schistosome lifecycle, such as eukaryotic translation factors, ribosomal proteins, histone proteins, tubulins, proteasome subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase subunits [19, 50]. The genes encoding S. japonicum 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 4 (PSMD4) and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2) have been extensively used as references for real-time PCR analysis [19,20,51,52]. Comparative genomics analysis indicated that a substantial proportion of these schistosome genes share various sequence identity with their homologous counterparts in H. sapiens. Importantly, crystal structures of some of the human proteins are available, providing a foundation for the future screening of compounds that specifically target schistosome proteins based on structural disparity (S5 Table). Some of the genes identified in the present study have been previously characterized as important functional genes for schistosome and potential anti-schistosome targets, although some of these genes were developmentally regulated during the lifecycle. For example, some genes encoding schistosome proteases (legumain, cathepsin B, C, D and L) that were up-regulated from cercariae to adult worms play key roles in obtaining nutrients from the host [20,53]. The schistosome tegumental aquaporin gene, which is important for parasite osmotic regulation, is most highly expressed during the intravascular life stages [54], and the schistosome thioredoxin glutathione reductase gene has been validated as a potential drug target for schistosomiasis chemotherapy [55,56].",

The most promising schistosome vaccine candidates are proteins located on the surface of the worms, such as the tegument proteins TSP-2 (tetraspanin protein) and Sm29 [58\u201360]. In S. mansoni, TSP-2, which plays a prominent part in the parasite tegument development and maturation, seems to be an effective vaccine antigen against the blood fluke [61,62]. A set of 107 genes with putative signal peptides and 276 genes with putative transmembrane helices were identified by sequence interrogation with SignalP 4.1 and TMHMM 2.0. These proteins may be secreted or surface-exposed and thus capable of interacting with the external environment. More importantly, we determined that a significant number of these stably expressed genes in adults were peculiar to Schistosoma species or the phylum Platyhelminthes and have no identity to genes in other organisms. Encouragingly, one of these Schistosoma- or phylum Platyhelminthes-specific genes (SjSP-13) has been identified as a novel biomarker for immunodiagnosis of S. japonicum infection exhibiting extremely high sensitivity (90.4%) and specificity (98.9%), with nearly no cross-reactivity with other fluke infections [63]. Therefore, Schistosoma- or phylum Platyhelminthes-specific genes, particularly secreted and transmembrane proteins, may be regarded as novel potential anti-parasite drug targets or vaccine candidates for future studies.",

            "text": "Structurally related members of the sperm-coating protein/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7 (SCP/TAPS; Pfam: PF00188) family have been characterized in a wide range of eukaryotes, including parasites [64]. Parasitic helminth SCP/TAPS proteins have been proposed to play important biological roles in the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage during the invasion of the mammalian host [64,65]. In S. mansoni, this family is termed venom-allergen-like proteins (SmVALs) and comprises at least 28 members [32]. SmVALs can be divided into two groups and exhibit various gene expression patterns throughout the entire life-cycle, including genes exclusively expressed in stages involved in intermediate host invasion or definitive host invasion and ubiquitously expressed genes [32]. Because of their potential functional classification, expression patterns and localization, SmVALs have been proposed as potential drug targets and vaccine candidates, and some members have been well characterized recently [66\u201368]. For instance, Farias et al. have demonstrated that SmVAL4 and SmVAL26 stimulate differential allergic responses in a murine model of airway inflammation [66]; and in a recent study, egg-derived SmVAL9 was found to carry an N-linked glycan containing a schistosome-specific difucosyl element and function as an immunogenic target during chronic murine schistosomiasis [68]. In our study, 20 non-redundant S. japonicum venom-allergen-like protein (SjVAL) genes were identified in the genome. In order to illuminate the phylogenetic relationships of VALs in the two Schistosoma species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using all the full-length protein sequences, except SmVAL23 of which conserved domain was incomplete. The result revealed that all the Schistosoma VALs could also be divided into two groups: sequences in group one contain the SCP_euk conserved domain (cd05380) and only a partial sequence had homologous counterparts between the two Schistosoma species; sequences in group two contain the SCP_GAPR-1_like conserved domain(s) (cd05382) and the majority had homologous counterparts (Fig 8A). Microarray analysis revealed that ten SjVAL genes were transcribed in adult worms, including four genes (AAW25717.1, AAW27353.1, CAX74321.1 and Sjp_0038950) that were differentially transcribed in worms from the four hosts and six genes (AAP06001.1, Sjp_0038960, AAW25247.1, AAW25499.1, AAW25007.1 and CAX74107.1) that were stably expressed in worms from the four hosts (Fig 8B). All four differentially expressed SjVAL genes belonged to group one, and three encoded proteins with a putative signal peptide, which may be excreted/secreted proteins and interact with their immediate environment. Moreover, further expression analysis, based on our recently released S. japonicum microarray data for cercaria, schistosomulum, adult worm and egg (GEO accession number: GSE57143) [20] indicated that these ten genes exhibited diverse expression patterns in the four developmental stages (Fig 8C). It suggests that the majority of Schistosoma VALs, if not all, may be susceptible to the environment in the life cycle implying a role in function of host adaptation. In S. mansoni, six SmVAL genes were demonstrated to be highly expressed in the cercaria by microarray analysis of larval stages associated with infection of the mammalian host, implying that the functions of these enigmatic genes are mostly associated with entry into the mammalian host [69]. Specifically, the transcription of gene Sjp_0038960 is restricted to the schistosomulum and adult stages, suggesting that this gene is important for schistosome parasitism in the mammalian host. Notably, only one gene, AAW25499.1, was constantly expressed among the four developmental stages, indicating that this gene may play a fundamental role in the schistosome life cycle. Indeed, AAW25499.1 was also stably expresses in worms from different mammalian hosts.",

The global transcriptional profiles of schistosomes from the four different hosts were generally coincident with each other. Meanwhile, a panel of differentially expressed genes was identified, which mainly involved in signal transduction and metabolism processes. A set of Schistosoma- or phylum Platyhelminthes-specific genes were differentially or stably expressed in schistosomes from the four different hosts and should be targeted in future hypothesis-driven functional studies. The findings of this study provide a rational basis for schistosomiasis research in different laboratory animals and natural mammalian host at the transcriptional level and a valuable resource for the screening of anti-schistosomal intervention targets.",
