Such framework describes how health communication functions within the context of risks and crisis. As the name reflects, CERC seeks to merge the traditions and best practices of risk communication into crisis communication. It positions communication centrally throughout the risk and crisis communication process, and it emphasizes the role of communication, primarily as a management tool from centralized authorities to the public through mass media channels. In this case report, we focus on the role of ERC as a crisis management tool during the MERS outbreak in Qatar by describing the delivery of information by central public health authorities and its reporting through a major media channel.",

In Qatar, narratives across the local newspapers are largely the same, particularly in publishing official press releases. Al-Raya newspaper was leading daily in terms of readership compared to the other four Arabic dailies in Qatar based on circulation statistics.

We believe that the acknowledgment of uncertainty since the beginning of the response allowed the SCH to increase public attention and situational awareness among responding agencies; and, that close consultation with international institutions of reference (i.e., WHO) contributed to the image of a competent governance and a unified communication strategy. By doing so, the authorities not only acknowledged the situation but also reported actions undertaken (e.g., investigations and epidemiological studies) and worked to achieve credibility by initiating a quick response to rumors and misperceptions.",
