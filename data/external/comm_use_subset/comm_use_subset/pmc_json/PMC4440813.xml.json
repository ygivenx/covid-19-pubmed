FMD is one of the major constraints to international trade in animal products due to its extreme contagiousness and broad spectrum of host species that includes wild and domesticated ruminants and suids. Control and regional eradication of FMDV is complicated by the existence of seven serotypes and several subtypes, transmissibility by air, and occurrence of a prolonged asymptomatic carrier state in a large proportion of infected ruminants. Although the role of persistently infected ruminants in disease transmission remains unclear, the international standards on FMD from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) indicate that in order to regain FMD-free status countries must demonstrate freedom of FMD virus infection [2]. Thus asymptomatic FMDV carrier animals are perceived as a threat and the existence of the carrier state complicates regaining FMD-free status. On this basis, FMD-free countries generally will maintain trade barriers for animals and animal products from countries that have not demonstrated absence of FMDV including absence of carrier animals.

FMDV carrier animals were subsequently defined as \u2018any animal from which FMDV can be recovered in oropharyngeal scrapings using a probang sampling cup during periods greater than 28 days post infection (dpi)\u2019 [8]. FMDV persistence has been demonstrated to occur in cattle, sheep, goats, Asian buffalo, and various wildlife species [9] most notably the African buffalo [10]. Persistence occurs with variable incidence regardless of FMDV vaccination status, clinical outcome of infection, challenge strain and dose, and host factors including sex and age (reviewed by Salt [5]). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inability of some animals to clear the virus including variations in the kinetics of the host response to FMDV infection [11], viral mutation leading to antigenic variation [12], or differences in the innate immune response [13]. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and resolution of the carrier state remain undetermined.",

Similarly, several investigators have confirmed that collection of oropharyngeal sputum with a probang device was an effective manner of recovery of FMDV from carriers [6,7,14,18]. However, this technique is incapable of indicating the identity of the specific tissues or cells within which the virus persists. Burrows was first to perform tissue-specific isolation of virus on FMDV carriers to identify the dorsal soft palate (i.e. floor of nasopharynx) as the site with greatest frequency of virus recovery and highest mean infectivity [14]. Furthermore, cell cultures derived from the pharynx of persistently infected cattle have been shown to remain FMDV-positive [19,20]. Persistence can also be established in pharyngeal primary cell cultures from uninfected animals by FMDV infection ex vivo [21].",

Additionally, FMDV RNA and antigens have been detected in lymphoid germinal centers in pharyngeal MALT tissues and lymph nodes of cattle at 38 days after challenge without concurrent detection in pharyngeal epithelia [15]. In a more recent study, Stenfeldt et al described the detection of low levels of FMDV RNA in biopsy samples of pharyngeal epithelia during persistent phases of infection. The lower FMDV RNA content compared to probang samples led to the conclusion that the targeted biopsy area within the DSP does not consistently harbor FMDV replication during persistent infection [22].",

This occurs through inhibitory effects on cytokine-driven pathways resulting in impaired function of antigen presenting cells and their precursors (reviewed by Grubman et al [24]). This ultimately could lead to suboptimal immune function favoring viral replication and delaying onset of specific adaptive T-cell response. Interferon (IFN) types I, II, and III have been demonstrated to impair FMDV replication in vitro and in vivo [25]. In order to successfully replicate, FMDV blocks expression of IFN and other IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [25]. However, in vivo replication will induce synthesis of substantial levels of INF I/III [26\u201329]. Other cytokines including IP-10, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 have been shown to affect FMDV replication through dendritic cells (DC) activation and maturation and NK cell recruitment, proliferation and activation (as reviewed by Toka et al [30]). Additionally, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 [31] and RANTES [32] have also been associated with playing a role in controlling FMDV replication and spread.",

In all cases, epithelia were consistently intact with no evidence of erosion, ulceration or microvesiculation. Lymph nodes and MALT were populated by appropriate quantity of cells with normal tissue architecture. FMDV antigen was microscopically localized within a subset of analyzed tissues. Within nasopharyngeal epithelia, FMDV structural and non-structural proteins were identified by immunohistochemistry as scarce individual cells or as small clusters of up to10 immunopositive cells within basal and/or superficial layers of epithelium (Figs 3 and 4). Epithelial segments containing FMDV antigen were typically closely associated with MALT follicles and were often lining the opening or lumens of crypts. Additionally, rare single cells containing FMDV protein were localized to subepithelial lymphoid regions. Simultaneous immunostaining for host cell antigens indicated that FMDV-positive cells were morphologically and phenotypically consistent with epithelial cells (cytokeratin+/MHCII-/CD11c-; Fig 4).

Earlier studies have reported that the epithelial cells of pharyngeal tissues [16,17,44] and/or retropharyngeal and submandibular lymph nodes [15,44] are the predilection site for FMDV persistence in cattle. This consensus is challenged by a recent study that suggests that the DSP and the submandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes cannot be definitively concluded to be the principal sites for persistence of FMDV due to inconsistent detection of FMDV RNA in these tissues [22]. The extent to which these differences across studies reflect variation in experimental designs, utilization of different FMDV strains, different treatments before inoculation, as well as different inoculation routes remains undetermined.",

This was accomplished through examination of up to 28 distinct tissues per animal from 21carrier cattle infected with one of three serotypes of FMDV. Specifically, dorsal nasopharynx, dorsal soft palate, and epiglottis had the greatest proportional detection of FMDV and FMDV RNA across all viruses. Interestingly, the tissues with the highest prevalence were located with tridimensional contiguity, forming the floor and roof of the nasopharynx. This anatomical region within Waldeyer\u2019s ring [45] has been reported to include primary sites of FMDV infection in cattle [22,26,35,36,46\u201350]. Thus, these pharyngeal tissues have unique structural and/or functional properties that facilitate permissiveness to FMDV infection and maintenance during early and persistent phases of FMD. FMDV and FMDV RNA were also detected within ventral soft palate, ventral larynx, regional lymph nodes (retropharyngeal and submandibular) and tonsils (palatine and nasopharyngeal) at lower prevalence. These findings are consistent with previous studies [14,51] and suggest that these tissues also may be involved in FMDV persistence, but with less consistency than the pharyngeal epithelia (MALT).",

This suggests that the interaction of virus and host in the nasopharynx during the carrier state is quite different from what occurs during acute infection. The characteristic vesicles of feet and mouth, for which FMD is named, have classical microscopic lesions consisting of acantholytic degeneration of keratinocytes, epithelial spongiosis, and sloughing of affected regions with resultant erosions [41,52]. Primary infection of the nasopharyngeal epithelium of cattle induces a less severe extent of an apparently similar process resulting in keratinocyte degeneration and ultimately cell loss (erosion) [36]. By contrast, the nasopharyngeal epithelium of carriers was consistently found to be intact with no evidence of erosion even in areas in which FMDV antigen was localized. This lack of evidence of cellular degeneration of FMDV-infected cells in carriers suggests a distinct mechanism in which infected cells survive and remain within the carrier\u2019s epithelium. These findings are consistent with previously published suggestion that in the carrier state, FMDV employs a distinct, non-cytolytic infection process which may be driven by alterations in cytokine signaling cascades and/or tissue specific decreased cell death mechanisms [3,53].",

In regions where antigen was found, it was localized to foci of individual, or small clusters of, immunopositive cells. This contrasts previous reports that have demonstrated regionally diffuse localization of FMDV RNA by in situ hybridization in the pharynx of carrier cattle [16,17]. The reason for this difference in localization is unclear, but may further support the concept of a limited virus replication cycle in carriers whereby only a subset of FMDV RNA-containing cells progress to producing viral antigens. The phenotypic profile of intra-epithelial cells containing FMDV antigens was uniformly cytokeratin (+)/ CD11c(-)/MHCII(-). This suggests that replication of FMDV in the pharyngeal epithelium of carrier cattle occurs in epithelial cells rather than intra-epithelial dendritic (Langerhans-like) cells.",

Recent reports from our laboratory describing the acute phase of FMD in cattle demonstrated modest induction of some of the same cytokine genes at these same tissues [26] and tissue-specific induction of IFN signaling pathways [53]. In the acute phase of infection, FMDV is largely similar to several other viral infections that generally induce proinflammatory and antiviral innate immune responses [13,26,28,53\u201356]. By contrast, there are examples wherein the persistent phase of FMDV and other viral infections have been shown to be associated with suppression or modulation the host immune response [13,57,58]. Thus, our demonstration of relative suppression of transcription of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and RANTES has some similarity to the suppressing expression of proinflammatory cytokines observed in herpes simplex virus type 1 during persistence [59]. However, no conclusive reports of immune system gene suppression have been published associated with FMDV persistent infection. Indeed, two studies have demonstrated upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 in tissues of cattle persistently infected with FMDV [13,34]. Additionally, decreased detection of IFN-\u03b2 and lower IFN signaling capacity have been demonstrated during the acute phase of FMDV infection of cattle [13,53].",

However, the mechanism whereby FMDV evades the host response is still unclear. Considering the current transcriptome data in the context of previously published works allows some novel insights into the mechanisms that contributed to this process. It is well established that FMDV is highly sensitive to IFNs type I, II, and III [61\u201367] and several studies have documented IFN production by cattle as part of the acute response to FMDV infection [13,26,68]. Thus, the decreased relative expression of mRNAs for IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3 in pharyngeal tissues of the FMDV carriers described herein suggests an association between transcription suppression of these genes and the FMDV carrier state. Specifically, our findings of a 3 to 4-fold suppression of IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression amongst carriers suggests immunomodulation that may benefit the persistence of FMDV as has been suggested by other investigators [13,34]. However, the causality of this association remains undermined; specifically, one might consider whether 1) FMDV dysregulated the expression of these genes thus enabling the carrier state or 2) a subset of cattle are intrinsically poor producers of IFN and it is these animals that ultimately become carriers. Previous work describing gene expression in tissues with different FMDV tropism from non-infected cattle suggested that pharyngeal tissues are intrinsically poor type I and III IFN inducers and responders, and this might explain their susceptibility to both primary and persistent infection (Zhu et al 2013). The results of the current study are consistent with those findings.",

IFN-\u03b3 induces the production of interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), which together with IL-4 is involved in epidermal DC activation, maturation and function [69,70]. Mature DC are able to produce IL-2, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 and these cytokines are involved in NK cell recruitment, proliferation and activation that would ultimately eliminate FMDV infected cells (as reviewed by Toka et al [71]). In the current report, we have documented more than 2-fold suppression of IP-10 and IL-4, as well as IL-2 and IL-12, up to 2-fold suppression for IL-18, and no substantial effect on IL-15 in the persistently infected tissues of carriers.

Trimodal detection of infectious FMDV, FMDV RNA, and viral antigen has confirmed the importance of the nasopharyngeal mucosal surfaces as sites of FMDV persistence. Although it is well-established that FMDV has immunomodulatory effects at various tissues at various stages of infection, precise understanding of these processes remains elusive. Through comparison of cytokine transcription levels in persistently infected tissues of FMDV-carrier cattle compared to controls, we have demonstrated a general trend of suppression of transcription of most genes examined including type I and II IFN and various interleukins. Although the effects were not statistically significant, there was an undeniable lack of immunostimulation which is often an expected result of a pathogen infection and has been previously reported for FMDV [26\u201329]. Further elucidation of viral modulation of host factors associated with the carrier state will reveal mechanisms that may be targeted in order to prevent or cure FMDV persistence. Such efforts are currently underway in our laboratory.",
