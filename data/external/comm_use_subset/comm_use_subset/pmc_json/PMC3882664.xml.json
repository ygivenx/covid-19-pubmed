A primary objective in systems biology is to understand the structure and connection between the diverse biological elements composing the living system, and how they dynamically change and interact in response to biologically important events, such as the host response to infection (Forst, 2006).",

A range of integration techniques have been suggested including machine learning methods (Lanckriet et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006; Daemen et al., 2008), probabilistic networks (Hartemink et al., 2002; Troyanskaya et al., 2003; Gat-Viks et al., 2006; Vaske et al., 2009), correlation networks (Adourian et al., 2008), statistical models (Nie et al., 2006; Fagan et al., 2007; L\u00ea Cao et al., 2008; Torres-Garc\u00eda et al., 2009), clustering techniques (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Waters et al., 2012) and applications of spectral theory (Berger et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012). To produce integrated network signatures, however, methods must be applied across extremely heterogeneous sources, which has proven difficult because of the extreme differences between data types. In particular, the integration of the transcriptome and proteome is a current challenge in omics research due to differences in dynamic range of measurements, incomplete annotation, isoform differences, and temporal effects, as several examples (Cox et al., 2005; Waters et al., 2006a,b; Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012).",

This work uses publically available data from an NIAID systems biology consortium study involving infection of SARS-CoV in mice. We have developed an approach to produce integrated network signatures of disease by leveraging earlier work on co-expression transcriptome networks (Zhang and Horvath, 2005; Yip and Horvath, 2007; Mason et al., 2009; Langfelder et al., 2008, 2011; Langfelder and Horvath, 2012) and our own work in proteomic co-expression networks (Gibbs et al., 2013). The signature consisted of a bipartite module graph, connecting co-expression modules obtained from transcriptomic and proteomic data, that is constructed using significant module member overlap, correlation of eigenvector summaries, and common phenotypic associations with outcomes of interest. The functional enrichment of module sub-graphs was overlapping across data types, further offering evidence of the underlying biological network structure. This work provides a framework for multi-omic prioritization of module members for biomarker studies as well as perturbation and validation experiments (see Figure 1).",

By that definition, ten out of 84 possible significant module overlaps were observed, forming three distinct sub-graphs, initializing the bipartite module graph. Overlaps were quantified by taking |Intersection(A,B)|/ min[size(A), size(B)]. Transcript module 1 overlapped with peptide modules 1, 4, and 8 (overlap amounts of 0.33, 0.39, and 0.42 with FDRs 0.0, 0.08, and 0.016 respectively).

We briefly describe an algorithm to prioritize module sub-graphs, given a set of phenotypes: initialize an n by m matrix where n is the number of transcript modules and m is the number of peptide modules. For each phenotype, the maximum and minimum (i.e., negative correlation) correlating modules from each data type are found. For each pair of modules in the matrix, and for each phenotype, if a pair of modules is maximum, +1 is added to the matrix element corresponding to this pair, and if the module pair has the minimum correlation, a \u22121 is added to the matrix position corresponding to the pair (see Figure 2 and Supplementary_Network_Results). In some cases, a module could arrive at a final summed score of 0 by alternatively winning both negative and positive correlations. Therefore, it might be necessary to keep scores strictly positive. This would return the maximum score by magnitude, without regard to direction, as an alternative prioritization procedure. After the prioritization routine, the set of biologically relevant multi-omic modules is ranked, providing a clear path toward targeted, downstream, analysis.",

These parameters can be separately tuned in order to produce optimal independent networks on data types, which can be used to produce integrated module graphs. Generating well-formed, independent networks should improve the odds of successful integration since they each more accurately reflect the underlying biology.

Additionally, there are peptides and transcripts, which are both correlated to phenotype, but are anti-correlated across data types. The apparent disconnect between data types makes interpretation difficult. The na\u00efve ranked list is expected to be less ordered compared to within-module rankings. This is seen in the fact that for NCP, the na\u00efve method returned no significant enrichment results, while the module level results did show significance. Compared to the na\u00efve ranking approach, the module level analysis avoided the problem of uncorrelated peptides and transcripts, by connecting modules using a set of metrics, rather than simple Entrez ID mapping. Additionally, the module organization returned considerably more significant enrichment results, and also showed more functional overlap across data types.",
