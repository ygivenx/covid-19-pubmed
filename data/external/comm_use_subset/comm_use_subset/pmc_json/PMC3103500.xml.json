The SARS-CoV genome consists of approximately 29,700 nucleotides encoding 28 putative proteins [6], [7]. Just like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome also contains several small open reading frames (ORFs) in addition to those encoding for structural proteins [6]\u2013[9].

Just like the internal (I) gene of other group II coronaviruses, the ORF-9b of SARS-CoV overlaps with its nucleocapsid ORF [8], [10]\u2013[12]. However, there is no homology between the SARS-CoV 9b and I protein of other coronaviruses. The 9b protein has been shown to get expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells and antibodies against it have been found in the sera of SARS infected patients, demonstrating that the protein is produced during infection [13]\u2013[16], but its actual function is not yet determined. Studies on 9b-structure by Meier et al., (2006) revealed a 2-fold symmetric dimer having a lipid binding cavity and proposed its role in virus assembly [17]. Cellular localization of 9b has been previously reported to be predominantly cytoplasmic and membranous. Also, a nuclear export signal (NES) present in its 46-LRLGSQLSL-54 amino acid region has been suggested to be responsible for its nucleocytoplasmic export [18].",

This entry of 9b into the nucleus was independent of cell cycle progression. Further, we showed that 9b which lacks the nuclear localization signal (NLS) continued to enter the nucleus passively and was able to exit the nucleus due to its functional NES. Also, nuclear export was found to be Crm-1 dependent and blocking NES based export resulted in an increased half-life of 9b, which accumulated in the nucleus. Finally, our studies revealed that when 9b remained within the nucleus, it triggered caspase 3 mediated apoptosis in transiently transfected mammalian cells. The requirement for caspase 3 in apoptosis induction was further confirmed using the cell permeant caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-FMK (general caspase inhibitor) and Z-DEVD-FMK (caspase 3 inhibitor). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the nuclear localization of 9b, its passive diffusion into and active Crm-1 dependent transport out of the nucleus. Also, this is the first report associating 9b with nucleocytoplasmic export linked apoptosis.",

By 18 h post-infection, many discrete cytoplasmic foci were observed, and by 24 h post-infection, small foci of nuclear staining appeared, while control uninfected cells showed no staining (Fig. 1b). Typical infected cells showed numerous nuclear foci of 9b protein by 36 h post-infection, as well as extensive, larger areas of cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 1a and 1b). By 48 h post-infection, many nuclei were seen to be changing their appearance and undergoing apoptosis, and majority of the cells at this time point contained fewer foci of the 9b protein (Fig. 1b, 48 h time point, second panel). Stacks of confocal images were used to generate three-dimensional projections, with merged data from the alexa fluor and DAPI channels (Fig. 1b). When viewed from the side and from the top, as well as sections through the volume projections, it was observed that the antibody staining (in green) was within the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm. These foci of fluorescence first appeared in the nucleus at 24 h post infection to reach a maximum at about 36 hr. p.i., and are somewhat reduced in numbers at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 1b). After the observation that some proportion of the 9b protein enters into the nucleus, we planned to check its localization in 9b transfected cells. Vero cells were transfected with the plasmid constructs pEYFPN1-9b (having 9b sequence fused to a yellow fluorescent protein coding sequence at the C-terminus region). Analysis of 9b-YFP localization showed that in addition to the extra-nuclear region, some amount of 9b was also present within the nucleus similar to the SARS-CoV infected cells (Fig. S1, panel (i), (ii) and (iii)). In a parallel experiment, only pEYFPN1 vector was transfected in order to rule out any effect due to the vector itself (Fig. S1, panel (iv), (v) and (vi)). Only cells showing clear nuclear localization of 9b were scored positive. Similar results were also obtained with HEK-293T and COS-7 cells (data not shown).",

To investigate the mode of nuclear transport of 9b, an in-vitro transport assay was performed. Initially, the 9b-YFP fusion protein was expressed in Vero cells separately and then their lysate was added to digitonin permeabilized cells. The cells were supplied with all necessary components needed for in-vitro transport as detailed in materials and methods. Results showed that both H5N1-NP (a positive control in the assay) and 9b-YFP were able to enter the nucleus in digitonin permeabilized cells (Fig. 4, panel (i) and (ii), respectively). On the contrary, the 3a-GFP protein (negative control) was not able to get into the nucleus (Fig. 4, panel (iii)). A protein sorting signal analysis of the 9b sequence (using PSORT program, http://psort.org/) predicted absence of NLS in it and suggested its nuclear import to be passive [30]. Further, in order to rule out the possibility that the 9b protein uses an active transport mode to enter the nucleus, we used wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin known to inhibit NLS dependent active nuclear transport [31]. When WGA was added to the cells, H5N1-NP (known to undergo NLS dependent nuclear import) was found to get restricted to cytoplasm indicating that WGA was able to inhibit the active transport of H5N1-NP protein through the nuclear membrane (Fig. 4, panel (iv)). However, SARS-CoV 9b showed similar nuclear localization even in the presence of WGA (Fig. 4, panel (v)). Thus, our data clearly shows that although the SARS-CoV 9b protein lacks a NLS, it enters the nucleus by passive transport. As expected, the negative control, SARS-3a remained cytoplasmic (Fig. 4, panel (vi)).",

            "text": "The nuclear export signal (NES) has been reported to be present in the C-terminal region of the 9b protein [18]. To confirm the involvement of the NES in 9b export, we mutated the essential amino-acids of the NES region (46-LRLGSQLSL-54 to 46-ARAGSQASA-54) and cloned it into the pEGFPN1 vector (now onwards called as mu-NES-9b). Cells were transfected with this mutant and were analyzed 36 hrs after transfection. Microscopic analysis clearly revealed that most of the fluorescence accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 5a, panel i-iii). Further, in order to check the role of NES in nuclear export of 9b, we treated the 9b-EYFPN1 transfected cells with Leptomycin-B (LMB); a drug known to inhibit active NES based export [32], [33]. We found that most of the 9b protein accumulated within the nucleus upon LMB treatment, confirming the role of NES in its nuclear export (Fig. 5b, panel iv\u2013vi). In order to reduce the cytoplasmic staining resulting from the newly synthesized 9b protein, transfected cells were treated with cyclohexamide and processed for microscopy. The reduction in cytoplasmic fluorescence in lower panels of Figure 5A and 5B confirms the effect of cyclohexamide treatment (Fig. 5a, panel iv\u2013vi and Fig. 5b, panel vii\u2013ix). The data obtained was confirmed by performing biochemical analysis of the fractionated lysates of transfected cells. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 36 hrs post-transfection and were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE gel followed by a western blot using anti-9b polyclonal antibody. Purity of the extracts was checked as described before. Results confirmed our previous observations (Fig. 5c). Taken together, all these results proved that 9b follows a NES dependent, active nuclear export. In order to confirm the localization pattern of 9b in the presence or absence of LMB, SARS-CoV infected cells were processed for western blotting at two different time points, 24 hrs and 48 hrs. Calnexin was used as purity control for nuclear and cytoplasmic extract preparation. The 9b protein was seen in both nucleus as well as cytoplasm at both 24 hrs and 48 hrs (lane 2 and 5, Fig. 5d, upper panel). This shows that 9b localizes both in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm in both transfection and infection conditions. Further, the effect of LMB was checked and the proportion of 9b in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts was compared in reference to total protein using densitometric analysis (Fig. 5d, lower panel). As shown in Figure 5d, total 9b in LBM treated cells seem slightly lower compared to untreated cells. This is most probably due to more cells in apoptotic phase. However, densitometry graphs clearly show that the percentage of nuclear 9b gets increased on LMB treatment which further supports our transfection data. The effect seems more pronounced at the 48 hrs time point. The only difference we observed between transfection and infection conditions was that even without LMB, a lot of 9b was seen in the nucleus 48 hrs post infection. This may be attributed to the impact of other SARS-CoV proteins (expressed during infection) on 9b localization.",

Our data has already indicated that 9b behaves like a shuttle protein, going into the nucleus passively and coming out using the NES. Keeping these facts in mind, we designed experiments to investigate whether nuclear export influences the intracellular stability of 9b protein. Vero cells transiently expressing 9b-EYFPN1 or mu-NES-9b were metabolically pulse-labeled followed by a chase period for 0, 30 and 60 min. Compared to 9b, we observed a significantly prolonged half-life for mu-NES-9b, indicating that nuclear export is continuously supplying substrate for the degradation machinery. Similar results were observed for 9b-EYFPN1 transfected cells treated with a nuclear export inhibitor, LMB (Fig. 6). The experiment was performed in triplicates and the significance of the data was calculated using \u201cGraphpad\u201d software. The differences between 9b, mu-NES-9b and 9b+LMB for time point of 30 min and 60 min were significant as the p value ranged from p = 0.0004 to p = 0.0013.",

For quantification of the apoptotic cells, TUNEL assay was performed (Fig. 7a, left panel). The number was significantly higher for LMB treated 9b transfected cells as compared to untreated cells. Similar results were observed for mu-NES-9b (Fig. 7a, right panel). These results indicated that blocking 9b nuclear export may induce cell death by apoptosis. Similar results were obtained when we checked the cell viability in SARS-CoV infected cells by MTT assay. Maximum viability of SARS-CoV infected cells was lost on LMB treatment suggesting that 9b nuclear export may be important for cell survival (Fig. 7b). However, the role of other viral proteins in this process can not be ignored. Saponin was used as control. To check the pathway thus involved in induction of apoptosis, we determined the levels of various cleaved caspases (caspase 3, 7 and 9) in transiently transfected cells. Western blot results show that 9b-EYFP induce apoptosis (only if its nuclear export is blocked) by increasing the cellular levels of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 7c, lanes1\u20134). As expected, mu-NES-9b induced apoptosis even in the absence of LMB. To confirm that the apoptosis is caspase dependant, Z-FA-fmk, Z-VAD-fmk and Z-DEVD-fmk (200 \u00b5M each) were added to cells 16 hrs post-transfection, and then every 4 hrs thereafter, for a total of four doses. The lysates were checked for the levels of cleaved caspase-3. Results confirmed that apoptosis induced by 9b (blocked in the nucleus) was caspase dependent (Fig. 7c, lanes 5\u20138). All these results collectively showed that the export deficient 9b protein lead to caspase-3 dependent apoptosis of the host cells. Therefore, an NES based nuclear export of 9b appears to be very significant for host survival and may play a vital role in supporting the SARS-CoV life cycle.",

In this study, we characterized the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the 9b protein and found that 9b enters the nucleus by a passive mode of transport whereas its export is active and NES-Crm1 interaction dependent. Further, in transfection experiments, we showed that this localization pattern of 9b was independent of cell-cycle stages. A time course study of 9b revealed that the pattern of its cellular localization remained unchanged irrespective of post-transfection time (data not shown). Disruption of 9b-Crm1 binding after mutating the critical residues within the NES, and nuclear accumulation of 9b on treatment with LMB, a Crm1 antagonist, reconfirmed our hypothesis.",

This import is not active and is NLS independent as 9b is able to enter into the nucleus even in the presence of WGA. WGA is known to bind to the nuclear pore complex and inhibit the nuclear localization signal (NLS)-dependent intracellular transport [8], [36]. Proteins below 50 kDa have been reported to get into the nucleus passively [37], [38]. SARS-CoV 9b is a small protein of about 13 kDa, thus there is a fair possibility of passive diffusion of 9b even as a dimer. However, the possibilities of exposure of a hidden NLS after conformational changes cannot be ignored. Our preliminary data suggests that 9b interacts with many nuclear proteins (Fig. S2A\u2013C). These interactions may also provide a possible reason for the presence of 9b in the nucleus.",

Nocodazole is an anticancer drug that interferes with the structure and function of microtubules during interphase and blocks cell-cycle progression at the G2-M phase [41].

Proteins like MAPK and survivin are reported to localize in both cytoplasm as well as the nucleus [43], [44]. Similar to 9b protein, survivin protein does not have NLS but contains NES. Survivin also enters passively into the nucleus. However, blocking nuclear export of survivin enhances its half-life [44]. Our results show that the 9b behaves similar to the survivin protein. We found that the half-life of 9b protein in cells is about 20 minutes and an active nuclear export is mandatory for proper degradation of the 9b protein. Our pulse-chase analysis clearly shows an approximate two-fold increase in the half-life of 9b protein, when its export from nucleus is blocked. The dependence of 9b degradation on NES is also supported by increased half-life of both; mutant (lacking essential amino acids of its NES region) as well as 9b treated with LMB. The NES based nuclear export has been shown to promote degradation of shuttle proteins like nuclear factor kappa B or inhibitory kappa B by the proteasome or ubiquitin pathway [35]. Similar to 9b, the degradation of many shuttle proteins has been reported to get delayed if their export is inhibited [44].",

There are certain proteins which function as transcription factor and on activation (by stress or infection) move into the nucleus [45], [46]. Nuclear localization of such proteins further regulates the genes that play a role in apoptosis and cell-cycle progression. We propose that the NES of 9b may remain unexposed until it binds to the nuclear proteins. Our preliminary results show that 9b binds with the nuclear proteins (Fig. S2). These interactions may be exposing the NES of 9b leading to the export of \u2018X\u2019 proteins along with 9b using the Crm1 dependent pathway.

The in-vitro transport assay performed in presence of 50 \u00b5g/ml WGA shows a passive mode of import for SARS-CoV 9b protein. Panel (iv) shows that the nucleocapsid protein of influenza was unable to enter the nucleus in presence of WGA showing that WGA was able to block the NLS dependent active transport into the nucleus. As shown in panel (vi), the SARS-3a protein was unable to get into the nucleus in WGA treated, digitonin permeablized cells. As shown in panel (v), the SARS-CoV 9b protein was able to enter the nucleus even in the presence of WGA showing that its entry is independent of active transport pathway. Arrows in various panels show the localization of protein.",

The localization of SARS-CoV 9b mutant (having alanine at place of leucine) show that in presence of mutated NES, the protein gets concentrated in nucleus. Panel (i), (ii) and (iii) shows mu-NES-9b, DAPI and a merge image respectively. In order to reduce the background resulting from newly synthesized 9b protein, transfected cells were treated with cyclohexamide for two hours and were processed for microscopy. Panel (iv), (v) and (vi) shows the protein localization in cyclohexamide treated cells. Arrow shows nuclear accumulation of 9b. B. The localization pattern of SARS-CoV 9b protein in the presence of LMB. Synchronized pEYFPN1-9b transfected Vero cells were treated with 25nM LMB. Results show that in presence of the drug used, most of the 9b protein gets blocked in the nucleus. Yellow color of 9b was converted into green. Panel (i), (ii) and (iii) shows 9b, DAPI and a merge image respectively. Panel (iv), (v) and (vi) shows the protein localization in LMB treated cells. Panel (vii), (viii) and (ix) shows the effect of cyclohexamide (CHX) on LMB treated cells. Arrow shows the localization of 9b. C. Biochemical analysis of the localization pattern of either mutated SARS-CoV 9b protein or wild type SARS-CoV 9b protein in the presence of LMB. Synchronized cells were transfected with the appropriate constructs. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 36 hrs post 9b transfection and were ran on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel followed by a western blot using anti-9b polyclonal antibody. Left panel shows purity of extracts. Results in right panel show that both mu-NES-9b as well as LMB treated 9b have increased nuclear localization of 9b. C and N represent cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts respectively. D. Biochemical analysis of the localization pattern of 9b protein in SARS-CoV infected cells. Synchronized cells were infected with the virus. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 24 and 48 hrs post infection and were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE gel followed by western blotting using appropriate antibody. The upper panel shows that 9b is present in both nuclear as well as cytoplasmic extracts. Calnexin was used to check the purity of extracts. Lower panel shows the densitometric comparison of nuclear and cytoplasmic 9b using Image J program. Results show that LMB treatment (50 nM) leads to an increased nuclear localization of 9b as compared to untreated cells. E. The SARS-CoV 9b protein interacts with Crm-1. Synchronized cells were transfected with the appropriate constructs and the lysate was immunoprecipitated using the mentioned antibodies. Next, western blotting was performed using either anti-9b or anti-Crm1 antibodies as per the case. Lane 2 in the lowermost panel clearly shows that 9b is able to pull out the endogenous Crm-1 protein. However, mutated NES clearly shows inhibition of binding of 9b with Crm-1 further confirming the presence of NES in 46\u201354 amino acid region. Lane 1 represents pEYFP-N1 vector which has been used as a negative control. Uppermost and central panel shows the expression level of Crm-1 and 9b respectively in the transfected cells. IP represents immunoprecipitation; W represents western blotting.",

Band intensities from three independent experiments were quantified using a phosphoimager and graphed with standard errors for 9b-EYFPN1, LMB treatment as well as mu-9b NES. The p value for differences between 9b, mu-NES-9b and 9b+LMB was calculated using \u201cGraphpad\u201d software and ranged from p = 0.0004 to p = 0.0013.",

The SARS-CoV 9b protein induces apoptosis, if blocked in the nucleus. A TUNEL assay was conducted in order to quantify the apoptotic cells. TUNEL-positive cells were counted from a total sample size of 200 cells in each set of experiments. Standard deviation was calculated from three independent experiments. The graph shows percentage of apoptotic cells. Arrows in left panel shows TUNEL positive cells. B. MTT assay was performed to check the effect of LMB (50 nM) on cell viability in SARS-CoV infected cells. Saponin was used as control. Maximum viability was lost when SARS CoV infected cells were treated with LMB. C. Apoptosis induced by the nuclear blocked SARS-CoV 9b protein is caspase 3 dependent. Cell lysate was used to measure cleaved caspases by Western blotting. Among all, only cleaved caspase 3 was picked up demonstrating the role of caspase 3 mediated apoptosis in cells having export deficient 9b protein. Lane 2 and 3 clearly shows that the cleaved caspase 3 is present only in LMB treated 9b protein or NES mutant of 9b respectively. Lane 1 and lane 4 shows the controls used in the assay. A faint band for cleaved caspase 3 was also seen in lane 4 which is attributed to the effect of drug treatment. To confirm that the apoptosis is caspase dependant, caspase inhibitors like Z-VAD-fmk and Z-DEVD-fmk (200 \u00b5M each) were added to cells 16 hr post transfection, and then every 4 h thereafter for a total of four doses. The cells were lyzed 36 hrs post transfection and the lysates were checked for the levels of cleaved caspase-3. Both Z-DEVD-fmk and Z-VAD-fmk were able to inhibit apoptosis (lane 5 and lane 6). The negative control inhibitor (Z-FA-fmk) had no inhibitory effect on apoptosis (lane 7). Results confirm that apoptosis induced by 9b (if blocked in the nucleus) is caspase dependent.",

Nuclear localization of such proteins further regulates the genes that play a role in apoptosis and cell cycle progression. We propose that NES of 9b may remain unexposed until it binds to the nuclear proteins (represented as \u2018nuclear protein\u2019 = \u2018X\u2019). Our preliminary data shows that 9b binds with the nuclear proteins (Fig. S2). This interaction may be exposing NES of 9b leading to the export of \u2018X\u2019 proteins along with 9b using Crm1 dependent pathway. This event may stop host cell response against stress caused by the viral infection.",
