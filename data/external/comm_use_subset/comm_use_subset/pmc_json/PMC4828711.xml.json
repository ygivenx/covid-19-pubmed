            "text": "The horses were immunized with eVLP produced from the infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-VP40-GP. The filamentous eVLP were observed under an electron microscope (Supplementary Figure 1) and confirmed to be morphologically similar to EBOV. Immunoblotting of rBV-VP40-GP infected Sf9 cell lysates demonstrated that the eVLP contained EBOV GP and VP40 (Supplementary Figure 2). Three horses were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with 7 injections of eVLP over 11 weeks and the hyperimmune sera were collected from each animal at specified timepoints (Fig. 1A) to determine the serum titers by neutralization assay against a recombinant HIV-1 virus pseudotyped with EBOV GP. A pseudotyped-virus was used for these studies to confirm the in vitro efficacy of the antisera preparations under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, before subsequent studies in the BSL-4 laboratory. Neutralizing serum titers were detectable after the 5th immunization at week 6, and increased until the 7th immunization at week 11 (Fig. 1B). The serum neutralizing antibody titers of two horses were 1:40,960 after seven immunizations, and was 1:20,480 for the third animal. The equine antisera (purified by ammonium sulphate-based precipitation) was then digested with pepsin at a concentration of 5\u201310 U/ml for 45 to 90 min and purified to generate F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. The purity of the antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 preparations, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by thin layer chromatography, was determined to be 95% and 83%, respectively (Fig. 2). Approximately 2000 mL of purified antisera could be obtained from each horse during each collection, with the stock concentration between 20\u201325 mg/mL. Up to 3\u20135 collections can be performed on each horse, therefore each hyperimmunized horse yields between 120 to 250 g of purified antisera.",

Moreover, the neutralization activities of both the equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 were complete at a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcg/mL, indicating that the two products were indistinguishable from each other in terms of neutralization at high concentrations. EBOV-specific IgG in the equine antisera preparations were also determined by ELISA. Serial 2-fold dilutions of stock antisera with a concentration of 18\u201320 mg/mL were assayed in triplicate over three independent experiments, and the titer was determined to be between 10,240 and 20,480 endpoint dilutions.",

The protective efficacy of equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 were assessed over three experiments in BALB/c mice. The first experiment was to compare the efficacy of antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 treatments side-by-side. Groups of 8 mice were given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of F(ab\u2032)2 at 200 \u03bcg per dose, twice daily for 3 days (b.i.d. \u00d7 3d), starting at either 1 or 2 days post-infection (dpi) with a uniformly lethal dose of MA-EBOV. For comparison, groups of 8 mice were administered an IP injection of equine IgG at 200 \u03bcg per dose (q.d. \u00d7 1d), at either 1 or 2 dpi. Control mice were given an equal volume of PBS in place of the treatment (q.d. \u00d7 1d) at 1 dpi. PBS was used instead of non-specific immunoglobulin or F(ab\u2032)2, because previous studies involving passive transfer of non-specific antisera in mice and NHPs did not result in protection1415, and thus survival due to the non-specific effects of serum proteins is considered unlikely. Control mice lost approximately 23% of its body weight over the course of the experiment and none survived, with a mean time to death (MTD) of 6.4 \u00b1 0.5 dpi. Five of eight mice given F(ab\u2032)2 starting at 1 dpi survived (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 18.7% and a MTD of 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 dpi; however, none of the mice given F(ab\u2032)2 starting at 2 dpi survived the challenge (p-value = 0.9777, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 19.0% and a MTD of 5.8 \u00b1 1.8 dpi (Fig. 4A,B). Five of eight mice given antisera at 1 dpi survived (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 14.6% and a MTD of 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 dpi (Fig. 4C). Three of eight mice given antisera at 2 dpi survived (p-value = 0.0446, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 12.3% and a MTD of 6.6 \u00b1 0.6 dpi (Fig. 4D). Comparing groups with equal treatment times, there was no statistical difference between F(ab\u2032)2 at 1 or 2 dpi (p-value 1.0000 and 0.0613, respectively). However, given that multiple administrations of F(ab\u2032)2 were required to achieve similar protection levels demonstrated by a single injection of antisera, the results suggest that equine antisera is a superior product to F(ab\u2032)2 in terms of efficacy, possibly due to a longer in vivo half-life of equine antiseras.",

Towards the end of the 1995 EBOV outbreak in Kikwit, Za\u00efre (presently Democratic Republic of the Congo), the passive transfer of whole blood from EBOV survivors to patients resulted in the survival of seven out of eight recipients18. However, safety concerns with blood transfusions, such as the spreading of blood-borne diseases, allergic reactions and concerns of inefficacy19 mean that this approach is controversial and will likely not be used unless a better alternative was unavailable. In the 1990s, Russian investigators had prepared hyperimmunized antisera from horses vaccinated with inactivated EBOV, which were shown to be effective when administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg to baboons, with 100% survival (2 survivors out of 2) when given 2 hours before challenge, and 67% (2 survivors out of 3) when given immediately after challenge20, although baboons are known to be more resistant to EBOV infection compared to other NHP species21. The survival benefits of the equine antisera were limited to a delay in the onset of viremia clinical symptoms when tested in cynomolgus macaques immediately after challenge, at a dose of 60 mg for an animal weighing between 5\u20136 kg22. Comparing to successful passive immunotherapy studies with purified IgG from NHPs (80 mg/kg), as well as ZMapp and MIL-77 (50 mg/kg), the dosage for the cynomolgus macaque experiment was likely too low at the time. Use of equine antisera as an emergency post-exposure treatment against EBOV has been approved in Russia, and several investigators that had been accidentally exposed to the virus have been administered this treatment, although it is not clear if they had actually been infected23.",

F(ab\u2032)2 was developed in this study due to past documented issues with antisera administrations, in which equine botulinum toxin and anti-snake venom antisera was shown to produce serum sickness at high doses24. However, mice that were given a single dose of antisera demonstrated more complete protection over a greater period of time compared to multiple injections of F(ab\u2032)2. This suggests that F(ab\u2032)2 has a shorter half-life compared to IgG (which has been confirmed in this study), and/or that virus neutralization plays a partial role in survival from EBOV. The observation that administering F(ab\u2032)2 at 1 dpi is more efficacious than when the same treatment was given at 30 minutes post-exposure (Fig. 5A) was also observed in past studies with therapeutic EBOV GP-specific monoclonal antibodies2526, and suggests that virus neutralization may play a bigger role in protection at a later timepoint after EBOV challenge. With regards to neutralization, past reports have shown that while elevated antisera levels in NHPs vaccinated against EBOV correlated with survival, levels of specific neutralizing antibodies did not27. It is a possible explanation as to why mAb KZ52, which was originally selected for its ability to neutralize EBOV28, failed to protect NHPs when given at a dose of 50 mg/kg starting 1 day before challenge29, and suggests that in the future, the screening of potentially efficacious antibodies against EBOV should not be based solely on the ability of the antibody to neutralize virus.",
