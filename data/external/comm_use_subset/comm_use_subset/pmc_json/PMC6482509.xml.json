            "text": "Equine rotavirus A (ERVA) has been identified as the leading cause of diarrhea in neonatal foals < 3 months of age and is responsible for 20 to 77% of foal diarrhea cases, causing significant economic losses to the equine breeding enterprises [1\u20137]. Rotaviruses are icosahedral, non-enveloped viruses with a double-stranded, segmented RNA genome (dsRNA) that belong to the family Reoviridae (genus Rotavirus) [8, 9]. The ERVA genome consists of 11 double-stranded RNA segments that encode for six structural proteins (VP1\u20134, 6 and 7) and six non-structural proteins (NSP1\u20136). Segment 11 encodes for two non-structural proteins (NSP5 and NSP6) [1, 10]. The rotavirus particle consists of a triple capsid, including an outer capsid composed of VP7 and VP4, an intermediate layer integrated by VP6 and an inner capsid formed by VP1, VP2 and VP3 [11\u201313]. The two outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, are the most variable and immunogenic proteins of the virus, which independently elicit neutralizing antibodies following infection [1, 14]. Based on VP6 identity, rotaviruses are classified into eight groups (A-H), from which group A rotaviruses (RVA) are the leading cause of diarrhea in humans and several animal species, including horses [15]. Group A rotaviruses are further classified into G-types and P-types according to the nucleotide sequence of the two outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, encoded by segments 9 and 4 of the genome, respectively [16]. Currently, 27 G-types and 35 P-types of RVA have been recognized in several species including humans [9]. Thus far, seven G-types (G3, G5, G6, G8, G10, G13 and G14) and six P-types (P[1], P[3], P[7], P[11], P[12] and P[18]) have been identified among the RVA affecting horses, with G3P[12] and G14P[12] being the most prevalent and epidemiologically relevant genotypes [1, 2, 17\u201319]. Other genomic arrangements involving G- and P-types different from G3/G14 and P[12] have been infrequently described as infecting horses [1].",

            "text": "Group A rotaviruses are transmitted through the fecal-oral route and infection in young foals is associated with life-threatening watery diarrhea induced by a combination of malabsorptive, osmotic and secretory mechanisms [1, 20]. Control of ERVA infection in young foals is achieved by the routine vaccination of pregnant mares with an inactivated vaccine and strict husbandry/hygienic practices to reduce the viral burden in the environment [1, 7, 21\u201323]. ERVA vaccines have been shown to aid in the reduction of the incidence and severity of diarrhea and also in the intensity and duration of viral shedding, however they do not guarantee full protection [1, 21, 22]. In addition, previous studies have shown that there is significant antigenic variation among ERVA genotypes, which leads to emergence of viruses that are not neutralized by antibodies elicited by the current vaccines [24\u201329]. Moreover, temporal and spatial variations in the prevalence and distribution of ERVA genotypes has been previously reported [2, 29, 30]. Therefore, it is important to perform genotypic characterization of ERVA strains in order to understand the molecular epidemiology of ERVA, identify novel viral reassortants and potential interspecies transmission, and assess vaccine performance in the field. Currently, sequencing of VP7, VP4 and other genome segments are required for genotyping circulating rotavirus strains. Conventional sequencing methodologies are generally labor intensive, low throughput and costly. Real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays, particularly TaqMan\u00ae assays, offer a wide spectrum of advantages compared to conventional RT-PCR and sequencing. Some of these advantages include high throughput sample processing, increased sensitivity and specificity, faster turnaround time, and ability to multiplex. Even though several singleplex and multiplex RT-qPCR assays have been developed for the genotyping of human RVA genotypes [31\u201335], none have been developed for the genotyping of animal rotaviruses thus far, including ERVA. Here, we developed and evaluated the performance of a one-step multiplex RT-qPCR assay that allows the rapid detection of ERVA and the genotyping of the most frequent G-types affecting horses (G3 and G14) in fecal specimens. Overall, the one-step multiplex RT-qPCR assay developed in this study can simultaneously detect and genotype G3 and G14 ERVA strains with a performance equivalent to that of conventional VP7-specific RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing.",

Cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off values were determined as the average Ct + 3 standard deviations of nine replicates of the endpoint dilution [42]. Precision (within-run and between-run imprecision) of the ERVA multiplex RT-qPCR assay was determined by performing 9 replicates of IVT RNA containing 105, 104 and 103 RNA copies/\u03bcl on the same run (within-run imprecision) or three replicates of IVT RNA containing 105, 104 and 103 RNA copies/\u03bcl tested on two different operational days. The coefficient of variation (%) was determined for each target concentration (G3 VP7, G14 VP7, and NSP3). The performance of the ERVA multiplex RT-qPCR assay was evaluated in fecal specimens and compared to the VP7-specific RT-PCR and G-typing by Sanger sequencing. Contingency tables (2 \u00d7 2) were generated to determine the sensitivity, specificity and agreement (kappa statistic) of each target within the multiplex RT-qPCR assay.",

Only three ERVA G3 positive samples were unable to be genotyped by the multiplex assay, however these were correctly genotyped by the G3-specific singleplex RT-qPCR assay. Overall, the G3 VP7 assay presented a 92.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity when compared to the VP7-specific standard RT-PCR assay, and a high agreement (98.31% [kappa = 0.951]). Finally, the G14 VP7 assay was able to correctly identify 44/44 ERVA G14-positive samples and did not amplify 132/133 ERVA G14 negative samples (Table 6c). Consequently, the G14 VP7 assay presented a 100% sensitivity and 99.2% specificity when compared to the VP7-specific standard RT-PCR assay. The agreement between assays was high (99.44% [kappa = 0.985]). Regarding the presumed false positive sample, although this sample was determined to be an ERVA G3P[12] by Sanger sequencing, it yielded a concurrent positive amplification by the G3 and G14-specific RT-qPCR assays in both their singleplex and multiplex formats, suggesting a possible co-infection with both genotypes of ERVA.",

Even though seven G-types and six P-types of ERVA have been identified in horses, the G3P[12] and G14P[12] constitute the most epidemiologically relevant genotypes [1, 2, 17\u201319]. Spatial as well as temporal fluctuations between these predominant G-types (G3 and G14) of ERVA circulating in equine populations have been reported around the world [2, 30]. Interestingly, the emergent pattern of G14 ERVA and the temporal shift in the prevalent genotype has been observed in association with the implementation of widespread vaccination programs in Argentina, Japan and Ireland [2, 30, 45, 46], which rely on the use of inactivated vaccines containing only the H2 or HO-5 (G3P [12]) strains of ERVA. The difficulties faced to date in establishing cell-culture adapted G14P[12] or other strains of ERVA has precluded their inclusion into vaccine formulations. However, we have recently isolated and cell-culture adapted, three G14P[12] ERVA strains with the potential to be used as reference G14P[12] strains to study the molecular biology of this genotype and perform vaccine efficacy studies following heterologous challenge in the future [29].",

Since genomic arrangements of ERVA other than G3P[12] and G14P[12] are rare and the outer capsid protein VP7 contains the major neutralizing epitopes, we developed a one-step multiplex TaqMan\u00ae real-time RT-PCR for the rapid detection and G-typing of the most prevalent genotypes of ERVA (G3 and G14) in fecal specimens. Compared to the conventional methods for ERVA genotyping (RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing), the multiplex RT-qPCR assay has a significantly faster turnaround time, is high-throughput, less labor-intensive and exhibits a high sensitivity, specificity and agreement as demonstrated in this study. While multiplexing did not have an impact on the detection limit of the NSP3-target, the G3 and G14 targets demonstrated a 100-fold difference in their analytical sensitivity under multiplex conditions. However, this difference in analytical sensitivity did not have a significant impact on their clinical performance on fecal specimens and only three G3 ERVA-positive samples were unable to be typed by the multiplex RT-qPCR assay (false negatives). Interestingly, these samples were correctly G-typed when the G3 VP7-specific assay was performed under singleplex conditions. Such differences are probably due to a combination of low target nucleic acid in these fecal specimens along with the 100-fold higher analytical sensitivity of the singleplex compared to the multiplex assay. Despite the low number of false negative samples (n = 3), all three targets (G3 VP7, G14 VP7 and NSP3) showed a high sensitivity and specificity (> 90%) along with a high level of agreement (> 98%) in the clinical specimens tested under multiplex conditions.",

Although confirmation would require RT-PCR using genotype-specific primers or next generation sequencing, due to the fact that both G3 and G14 ERVA strains were identified to be co-circulating in the same farm during the same time period, these results suggest that this dual-positive fecal specimen most likely derived from a foal that was co-infected with both G3 and G14 ERVA strains. Consequently, this may indicate that the multiplex RT-qPCR assay developed can be advantageous for the diagnosis of co-infections with G3 and G14 strains of ERVA that are currently challenging to identify. Further assessment using spiked specimens is required in order to analyze this multiplex RT-qPCR assay\u2019s capability to identify co-infected animals. Due to the lack of reference strains and uncommon occurrence of other ERVA G-types, these were not included in this study. Therefore, it is imperative to perform Sanger sequencing on those samples that test positive for ERVA by amplification of NSP3 but are not genotyped as G3 or G14 by the current assay. In this regard, the genotyping assay developed here will facilitate rapid genotyping of circulating strains and identify rare G-types that can then be incorporated into this assay depending on their epidemiological relevance.",

This assay demonstrated to have a high sensitivity, specificity and agreement compared to conventional RT-PCR and sequencing, providing rapid and reliable G-typing of ERVA strains. Therefore, this assay is highly suitable for routine diagnostics as well as to aid current surveillance programs of ERVA by rapidly characterizing circulating strains. Finally, the number of specific targets included in this assay can be updated and expanded as other genomic arrangements of ERVA emerge and become prevalent in equine populations.",
