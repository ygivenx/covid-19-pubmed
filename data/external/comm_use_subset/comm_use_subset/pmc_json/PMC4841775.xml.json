            "text": "Because of increasing global population and worldwide exchanges, infections by RNA viruses are expanding with a huge impact on public health. New infections are emerging almost every year (pandemic flu, West Nile encephalitis, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, chikungunya, Ebola), tropical fevers are expanding (dengue, zika) and even previously controlled diseases are re-emerging (measles, poliomyelitis). Although several efficient vaccines against RNA viruses are used in human medicine, we still lack potent therapeutic treatments for the majority of viral infections as well as rational strategies to create efficient new vaccines. Recent progress in our understanding of cellular pathways controlling viral replication suggests that modulating host cell functions early upon viral infection could inhibit a large panel of RNA viruses (Cheng et al., 2011; Shirey et al., 2011; Es-Saad et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2012; Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013). The RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) appear to be located at the frontline of the evolutionary race between viruses and the host immune system (Vasseur et al., 2011). These are cellular proteins that detect invasion of viral nucleic acid species inside the cytoplasm and initiate innate immune responses against viral infections that limit virus replication and trigger an adequate adaptive immune response (Errett and Gale, 2015). RLR signalling operates ubiquitously. Hence, RLRs represent attractive strategies for antiviral therapy and vaccine development.",

            "text": "The RLR family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a group of cytosolic RNA helicases that can identify viral RNA as non-self via binding to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs. To date three RLR members have been identified: RIG-I (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene-I), MDA5 (Melanoma-Differentiation-Associated gene 5), and LGP2 (Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2) (reviewed in [Loo and Gale, 2011; Dixit and Kagan, 2013]). They share a number of structural similarities including their organization into three distinct domains (Figure 1A): i) an N-terminal region consisting of tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD), ii) a central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain with the capacity to hydrolyze ATP and to bind RNA, and iii) a repressor domain (RD) embedded within the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). These RNA helicases interact with particular signatures of viral RNA, most of which are still unknown. Upon ligand recognition, RLRs bearing the CARD domain (MDA5 and RIG-I), undergo a conformational change that permits the CARD domain to be recruited and to oligomerize with MAVS either in the peroxisome or the mitochondrion. This activates signalling pathways leading to translocation of the transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kB into the nucleus to initiate expression and secretion of type I IFNs and other proinflamatory cytokines. Secreted type I IFNs bind to their receptors and activate the JAK/STAT signalling pathway inducing the expression of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) bearing IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) (de Veer et al., 2001). If the virus has no means for subverting the interferon pathway, the infected tissue turns into an antiviral state leading to i) apoptosis of the infected cells, ii) limited propagation of the virus by the expression of ISGs in neighbouring cells and iii) generation of a cytokine storm that triggers the specific adaptive immune response as well as favouring immune cell infiltration from the cardiovascular system.",

RIG-I confers recognition of hepaciviruses and of members of the Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae families. For example, 5\u2019copy-back defective-interfering (DI) genomes produced by numerous negative-sense RNA viruses specifically associate with RIG-I and activate IFN induction (Strahle et al., 2006; Baum et al., 2010; Komarova et al., 2013; Runge et al., 2014). MDA5 detects members of the Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae. Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, and Arenaviridae are detected by both MDA5 and RIG-I. LGP2 can act both positively or negatively upon activation by different viruses (Moresco and Beutler, 2010; Deddouche et al., 2014). Several DNA viruses have also been reported to activate the RLR pathway, including Herpes simplex virus-1, Adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Vaccinia virus and Hepatitis B virus (Choi et al., 2009; Sato et al., 2014). In the case of DNA viruses, poly dA:dT DNA sequences trigger IFN responses after RNA polymerase III transcription and detection by RIG-I (Ablasser et al., 2009; Chiu et al., 2009). Surprisingly, intracellular bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri also activate type I IFN responses through RIG-I signalling and Plasmodium RNAs are sensed by MDA5 during malaria infection (Chiu et al., 2009; Monroe et al., 2009; Liehl et al., 2013; Patel and Garcia-Sastre, 2014).",

One-STrEP tag provides a reliable, rapid and efficient protocol for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and protein complexes purification (Komarova et al., 2011; 2013). We tagged the RLRs N-terminally since previous studies have shown that adding N-terminal tags to RLRs had no negative effect on functional interactions with their RNA ligands (Pichlmair et al., 2009; Rehwinkel et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013a; Deddouche et al., 2014). These cell lines were assigned ST-RLR cells (ST-LGP2, ST-MDA5 and ST-RIG-I, respectively). In addition, a stable cell line (assigned ST-CH) expressing the Cherry protein instead of tagged RLRs was generated as a negative control to allow subtraction of non-specific RNA binding. Using RT-qPCR analysis and affinity purification followed by western blot analysis we validated the expression of tagged RLRs by each stable cell line (Figure 1B\u2013F). We then analysed the functional profiles of the ST-RLR cell lines upon transfection with RIG-I and MDA5 agonists by using a classical IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity assay (Figure 1G). We observed that transfection of ST-MDA5 and ST-LGP2 cells with MDA5 agonist poly(I:C) elicited an increased IFN-I response. In contrast, transfection of ST-LGP2 cells with the RIG-I agonist 5\u2019triphosphate-RNA (5\u20193P) masked the IFN-I response (Figure 1G). These observations are in accordance with previous studies showing that over-expression of MDA5 or simultaneous co-expression of MDA5 and LGP2 synergize type I IFN response upon activation with MDA-specific agonists or upon infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (Bruns et al., 2013). LGP2 over-expression has also been previously found to inhibit RIG-I signalling (Moresco and Beutler, 2010). Altogether this demonstrates that the three stable cell-lines that we established express tagged RLRs that are functional and can be purified by affinity chromatography.",

To assess CHIKV replication kinetics in tagged RLR cell lines we used a molecular clone of CHIKV (CHIKV-Rluc) at different MOI: 0.05, 1, 2.5. In this virus the reporter Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene is expressed as an integrated part of the non-structural polyprotein of CHIKV. The CHIKV-Rluc allows monitoring the early stage of viral replication (Henrik Gad et al., 2012). CHIKV-Rluc replicated in the 4 cell lines as detected by strong Rluc expression and classical growth kinetics for this virus (Figure 3A). However, similarly to MV we observed that CHIKV replication was reduced at low MOI in ST-RIG-I cells.

We observed that RNA ligands purified from LGP2 and RIG-I receptors in the presence of MV or CHIKV infections had an increased immunostimulatory activity in comparison with MDA5-specific RNA ligands (Figure 4A and B). As expected, RNAs purified from negative control CH provided poor immunostimulatory activity in the same experimental setup as well as RNA purified from RLR complexes in the absence of a viral infection (Figure 4). These results demonstrate that RNA ligands bound to ST-RLRs are specifically enriched for immunoactive RNA molecules, and that our experimental strategy is sensitive enough for the isolation of RLR-specific RNA ligands for both negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses within infected cells.",

To distinguish between RLR-associated RNA molecules and non-specific binding to the beads, co-affinity purification experiments were performed in parallel on ST-CH cells. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Approximately, 16 million reads of 51 nucleotides in length were obtained from each sequencing sample and were mapped to the viral genome. This gave MV genome coverage ranging from 274X to 2433X. We also performed NGS analysis of total RNA samples. Total RNA results provided a classical example of the transcription gradient, which is the characteristic of the order Mononegavirales. Indeed, MV transcription is initiated from a single promoter at the 3\u2019 end of the genome and at each gene junction the virus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase either falloff or continue the transcription of the downstream gene (Cattaneo et al., 1987; Plumet et al., 2005). Due to this gradient of transcription, MV promoter-proximal genes are expressed more efficiently than promoter-distal genes.

LGP2 associated RNA sequences represented only a short part of the N coding region and were also enriched in L gene-derived RNAs with both positive and negative polarities (Figure 6B). Surprisingly, we failed to detect any RIG-I specific reads aligning to the MV genome (not shown). This was unexpected since in the above-presented silencing experiment, RIG-I was the only important of the three RLRs sensor for innate immunity activation upon MV infection (Figure 5B).

Therefore, we looked for the presence of DI RNA molecules in ST-RIG-I cells infected with MV by using universal 5\u2019 copy-back DI genome specific primers. RT-PCR analysis failed to detect any 5\u2019 copy-back DI RNA in infected ST-RIG-I cells (Figure 7A). Interestingly, when the same cells were infected with MV\u25b3V virus deficient in V protein, two DNA fragments of approximately 1 and 4 kb were amplified from total RNA samples using 5\u2019 copy-back DI genome specific primers (Figure 7A). Furthermore, sequencing analysis revealed that the 1 kb RT-PCR amplicon contained all the 5\u2019 copy-back DI-RNA features. Indeed, this 1236 nucleotide-long DI genome included genomic 'trailer' (Tr) and the reverse complement of the Tr sequences at the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 extremities and the exact complementary of the extremities of 201 nucleotides able to hybridize to form a stem-loop structure (Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1). Sequencing analysis of the 4-kb amplicon suggested that it could correspond to a mosaic type of MV DI genome (Marriott and Dimmock, 2010). Further, the immunostimulatory activity of RIG-I/RNA purified from MV\u25b3V infected cells demonstrated a significant increase in ISRE stimulation compared to RIG-I/RNA purified from MV infected cells (Figure 7B). Interestingly, the immunostimulatory activity of total RNA purified from MV and MV\u25b3V infected ST-RIG-I cells was similar (Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2).",

As expected, when normalized read counts were represented along MV genome, a vast majority of reads aligned to the 5\u2019-end of the genome with sequences of both positive and negative polarities (Figure 7C).

This qPCR analysis used three different probes aligning at the beginning and the end of the MV-N mRNA (Figure 10A) and validated that MDA5-associated RNAs most likely represent transcripts coding for the MV-N protein (Figure 10B). As negative control three other MV mRNAs coding for M, P and H proteins were looked for and not found to be enriched in MDA5/RNA samples (Figure 10B).

            "text": "RLRs are located at the frontline of the evolutionary race between viruses and the host immune system. These cytoplasmic proteins detect invasion of viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells and trigger innate immunity. The inflammatory response is necessary for limiting viral replication and initiating a specific adaptive immune response. Most of the studies on RLR specific viral RNA ligands are performed in the absence of a productive virus infection (for review see [Yoneyama et al., 2015]). These studies are based on transfection within cells of RNAs coming from infected cells, expression of viral-coding sequences from plasmids, or transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA or synthetic RLR agonists such as poly(I:C). Recently, to characterize RNA ligands of RLRs in the presence of active viral infections (Sendai and Influenza viruses, then MV and EMCV), NGS has been applied on RNAs isolated from infected cells by co-IP. In these studies the methodological approach was based on either Photo Activable-Ribonucleoside-enhanced CrossLinking and co-IP (PAR-CLIP) or simple co-IP followed by NGS. Using these approaches for Sendai and Influenza viruses only RIG-I specific RNA partners were analysed (Baum et al., 2010), for EMCV only LGP2-specific RNA partners were sequenced (Deddouche et al., 2014), and for MV RIG-I and MDA5 specific RNA partners were studied simultaneously (Runge et al., 2014). The disadvantages of RNA-protein isolation by co-IP approaches are that (i) they rely on the availability of high-affinity antibodies against the protein of interest and (ii) they often lack an appropriate negative control. Negative control antibodies with different affinities and directed against proteins that are absent from the cells can easily underestimate the background noise generated by co-IP followed by NGS. Also, for the PAR-CLIP methodology, the incorporation of the nucleoside analogue 4-thiouridine (4SU) within RNA during the active cycle of viral replication could change the molecular properties of viral and cellular RNAs, thus creating an artificial environment.",

Consistent with previous studies we observed that RIG-I/RNAs provided a stronger immunostimulatory activity in comparison to MDA5/RNA molecules (Ikegame et al., 2010; Runge et al., 2014). In the same experimental set-up we showed that LGP2-specific RNA had a similar immunostimulatory activity to RIG-I/RNAs (Figure 4). Thus, for the two infections more immunoactive RNA ligands were purified with LGP2 and RIG-I than with MDA5.",

The inflammatory response in non-hematopoietic cells is known to be dependent on MAVS, the adaptor molecule necessary for both RIG-I and MDA5, however which of the two receptors is involved in sensing CHIKV is still unknown (Schilte et al., 2010). We found that RIG-I specifically interacts with the 3\u2019-UTR of CHIKV genome. Despite the higher coverage of the CHIKV genome compared to MV genome in our NGS data, we failed to observe specific enrichment in CHIKV reads on LGP2 and MDA5 receptors. The observation that RIG-I specifically interacts with CHIKV 3\u2019-UTR is very promising (Figure 9). Indeed, the 3\u2019-UTR of positive-sense RNA viruses has already been shown to be particularly immunoactive (Saito et al., 2008; Schnell et al., 2012; Kell et al., 2015). CHIKV 3\u2019-UTR contains multiple 21 nucleotide-long repeated sequence elements forming dsRNA structures, which are possible targets for RIG-I (Zhang et al., 2013b). Interestingly, the 3\u2019-UTR has recently been described as a region particularly sensitive to the evolutionary pressure exerted by mosquito vectors (Chen et al., 2013). Thus, we observed that in the mammalian host RIG-I targets the same viral region. To our knowledge this is the first time that RIG-I affinity for the 3\u2019-end of a positive-sense RNA virus is demonstrated in physiological conditions.",

However, we observed several discrepancies. We found that MDA5 and not RIG-I specifically interacted with MV-N coding sequences. RIG-I specific positive- and negative-sense reads only represented 5\u2019 copy-back DI-genome and were equally distributed along the 5\u2019-end of the MV genome (Figure 7C). Similar NGS profile of the 5\u2019 copy-back DI genome on RIG-I was previously observed in the context of Sendai virus infection (Baum et al., 2010). In this study only a single population of 546 nts-long 5\u2019 copy-back DI RNA genome has been specifically enriched on RIG-I. Thus, the concordance of our results for RIG-I with Baum et al. study nicely confirms the relevance of our strategy.",

We propose that self-RNA molecules processed by the action of the antiviral endoribonuclease RNaseL on cellular RNA could be specific RNA ligands that bind RIG-I and induce IFN-\u03b2 expression. Indeed, RNaseL induces type I IFN via production of short-length RNA molecules of viral and cellular origins by the mechanism that includes interaction with MDA5 and RIG-I (Malathi et al., 2007; 2010). In the current experimental setup we used a sample multiplexing that allowed an appropriate analysis of relatively long viral-derived RNA and not cellular RNA molecules. Alternatively, it is possible that MV RIG-I-specific RNA ligands are short length and thus not compatible with the classical Illumina NGS protocol applied in this study. In the future this protocol will be adapted to study small size RLR partners and to study RLR-specific cellular partners.",

Using NGS, they mapped this RNA on the L region of the EMCV genome. Numerous functional assays were performed to validate that the L region is a key determinant of the MDA5 stimulatory activity (Deddouche et al., 2014). This work supported previous studies showing that in an infected cell, MDA5 and LGP2 positively cooperate with each other (Venkataraman et al., 2007; Satoh et al., 2010; Bruns and Horvath, 2012; Childs et al., 2013). In vitro studies of MDA5 suggested that MDA5 hypothetically recognizes long dsRNA molecules like poly(I:C) (Kato et al., 2008). MDA5 binds dsRNA from the stem of the molecule and starts forming filaments towards its extremities (Peisley et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013). Recent studies of autoimmune disorders have proposed that MDA5 detects aberrant secondary structures formed by self mRNAs (Liddicoat et al., 2015). All these are evidences that most certainly MDA5 natural ligands are RNA stem structures embedded within different RNAs. In concordance with this, our results show that MDA5 recognizes the integrity of the MV-N mRNA, certainly through the recognition of stem loop structures. Further, our in silico (Mfold) prediction of RNA secondary structures within the different parts of the MV genome suggested that MV-N mRNA had a potential to form stem loop structures (Figure 8D).",

            "text": "In summary, using One-STrEP-RLRs affinity chromatography purification and NGS we provide the first simultaneous visualisation of specific RNA ligands for RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 in living cells and in the presence of different RNA viruses. Our results show that each of these cytosolic sensors has its individual RNA profile upon infection with different RNA viruses (Figures 6, 7 and 9). Previous studies demonstrated RIG-I specific binding to the AU- and polyU/UC-rich regions of viral genomes (Saito et al., 2008; Schnell et al., 2012; Runge et al., 2014; Kell et al., 2015). In our results RLR-specific binding cannot simply be explained by primary RNA composition or AU/GC content of RNA ligands. Indeed, we found RIG-I preferential binding to the AU-rich sequences (Figure 8C), but this binding was observed only when a dsRNA-containing DI genome was produced by the recombinant MV\u25b3V. These results suggest that RIG-I recognizes specific RNA secondary structures. MDA5 and LGP2 specificity to AU-rich RNAs was less pronounced (Figure 8A and B). Additional studies should be performed to obtain a clearer view on the similarities and the differences of RNA structures recognized by each of the three RLRs. For this, we are currently applying our One-STrEP-RLR approach to three other RNA viruses as well as to an intracellular bacterium. As a consequence, this work offers new strategies for immune and antiviral therapies by targeting the RLR pathway for the therapeutic control of viral infections, enhancing the immune response for vaccines, and conceiving strategies for immune suppression to control inflammation or specific autoimmune diseases.",

The corresponding DNA fragments were cloned by in vitro recombination into pDONR207 entry vector (BP reaction, Gateway, Invitrogen). RLR genes (MDA5: AF095844; LGP2: AAH14949 RIG-I: CCDS6526.1) were finally recombined from pDONR207 to One-STrEP-tag pEXPR-IBA105GW by in vitro recombination (LR reaction). These new plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells using JetPrime reagent (#114\u201315, Polyplus Transfection, Strasbourg, France). Two days later, culture medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium containing G418 at 500 \u00b5g/ml (#G8168, SIGMA, St. Louis, Missouri). Transfected cells were amplified and subsequently cloned by serial limit dilution. At least 5 clones were screened for each RLR to detect the tagged protein expression by qPCR and Western Blot.",

CHIKV strain 06\u201349 was titrated on VERO cell by TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose). Recombinant CHIKV-Rluc which contains the Rluc reporter gene inserted between the non-structural nsP3 and nsP4 proteins has already been described (Henrik Gad et al., 2012). Attenuated MV Schwarz vaccine strain (MV) and recombinant MV Schwarz expressing Fluc (rMV2-Fluc) from an additional transcription unit derived from MV have been previously described (Combredet et al., 2003; Komarova et al., 2011). To prevent V protein expression from MV, a two-step PCR strategy was used to generate MV\u0394V virus. Two PCR fragments were amplified using MV2313 (5\u2019-ATCTGCTCCCATCTCTATGG) and MV2504 (5\u2019-TCTGTGCCCTTCTTAATGGG) for the first fragment and MV2485 (5\u2019-CCCATTAAGAAGGGCACAGA) and MV3385 (5\u2019-AGGTTGTACTAGTTGGGTCG) for the second fragment. These PCRs introduced a mutation interfering with RNA editing (UUAAAAAGGGCACAGA native sequence was mutated to UUAAgAAGGGCACAGA). The two PCR products were combined in a second PCR reaction using MV2313 and MV3385 primers. The produced mutated HindIII-SpeI MV fragment was moved into the pTM-MVSchwarz plasmid after digestion with the corresponding restriction enzymes. Recombinant virus was rescued as previously described (Combredet et al., 2003) and named MV\u25b3V. Immunoblot analysis was performed to validate the lack of MV-V expression by MV\u0394V (data not shown). Virus stocks were produced on VERO cells, and titrated by TCID50.",
