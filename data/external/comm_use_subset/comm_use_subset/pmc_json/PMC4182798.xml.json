            "text": "Oral cancer represents the sixth most prevalent cancer in the world. Among the different types of oral cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) arising from the oral mucosa accounts for more than 90% of these malignancies. Thus, OSCC is the most common malignancy affecting the head and neck region. Notably, there are nearly 300,000 new cases of oral cancer reported annually [1], [2], and it was estimated that approximately 128,000 oral cancer patients died worldwide in 2008 [3]. Therefore, despite recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical therapy) the survival rate of OSCC patients has remained less than 60% [4], [5]. A fundamental barrier in improving the survival of OSCC patients is the fact that these malignancies often remain undetected until the later stages. In this regard, it was reported that a several-month delay in diagnosis could reduce the chance of survival from 80% to 40% [6]. Thus, in order to prevent the high OSCC-related mortality rate, recent attention has been focused on identifying potential diagnostic molecular markers (e.g., cell cycle regulators) that might represent biological predictors of oral cancer [7]. Moreover, OSCC has been linked to several risk factors, including various bacterial pathogens [8], which might be useful for detecting OSCC.",

            "text": "Recent studies have indicated that early diagnosis, lifestyle modification, and effective treatment can prevent more than two-thirds of OSCC-related mortalities. However, currently available diagnostic methods do not allow for the detection of oral cancer in the early stages. To visualize malignant lesions in the oral cavity, different microscopic methods are available, which make use of various techniques, including autofluorescence, chemiluminescence, or dye-based tissue staining. However, due to the low sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic strategies, clinicians generally use biopsies to detect OSCC [9]. Nevertheless, successful diagnosis through tissue biopsy is highly dependent on acquiring whole and complete tissue samples from patients for examination. In this regard, biopsies harvested from oral cancer patients are often associated with the soft tissues that surround the cancer tissue. In addition, oral cancer frequently involves the development of multiple primary tumors. Indeed, the occurrence of a second primary tumor is 3\u20137% higher per year in oral cancer when compared to other malignancies [10]. Therefore, the identification of suitable and reliable OSCC biomarkers is essential for achieving early detection and treatment, which can reduce mortality rates in OSCC patients. In this respect, antibody-based diagnostic tests that recognize specific tumor-associated antigens in cancer sera might represent a valid methodology [11].",

However, through this approach, numerous post-translational forms of protein regulation, including regulating enzymes and low abundance proteins may remain undetected. Thus, in the present investigation, we employed an immunoproteomic approach and pooled human antibodies to detect host-specific response proteins in OSCC patients. Specifically, we used a well-characterized analytical platform combining two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to identify biomarkers in unfractionated sera from OSCC patients and normal controls. This immunoproteomics approach can be used to identify antigens targeted by the immune system in sera during disease progression. In addition, the immune responses are known to be involved in the mechanism of carcinogenesis [13]. Therefore, our comparative analyses revealed distinct OSCC biomarkers that might promote the development of specific diagnostic tests for early detection of oral cancer.",

Furthermore, MS analysis revealed complement C3c (C3) as additional host-specific protein, which found to be immunoreactive and also five non-host factors (A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5), which corresponded to antigens from Acinetobacter lwoffii, Burkholderia multivorans, Myxococcus xanthus, Laribacter hongkongensis, and Streptococcus salivarius. In total, we identified 13 host and non-host specific protein spots, which were subsequently subjected to MS analysis (MALDI-TOF/TOF). Data regarding the identification (ID), MASCOT accession number, isoelectric point (pI), and molecular mass (Mr) for each protein are presented in Table 2 and 3.",

However, although many researchers have reported increased CLU expression during tumorigenesis, we have observed significantly down-regulated CLU levels in sera from OSCC patients. Nevertheless, other reports have also described a similar loss of CLU expression in various tumors, including prostate cancer [34], pancreatic cancer [32], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [35] and neuroblastoma [36]. Notably, these discrepancies may stem from the fact that there are differentially expressed CLU isoforms in human tissues and fluids that may exhibit distinct functions in tumors [14], [37]. Even though it has been suggested that CLU down regulation could be associated with disease progression [32], [38], this may depend on the type of cancer [39], [40]. Notably, the true function of CLU has remained elusive despite extensive investigation. So far, CLU has been proposed to participate in the immediate cellular response to stress, which regulates cell growth and survival [41]. In this regard, its function appears isoform dependent, with both proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic forms [34].",

Although our detection of these factors could have resulted from nosocomial infections [60], [61], heightened risk of malignancy has been linked to viruses, bacteria, and schistosomes [62], [63]. In fact, the relationship between bacterial infections and cancer has been discussed for decades [64], [65]. In this regard, there are several possible mechanisms by which bacteria could be oncogenic. For example, altered host responses during bacterial infection (e.g., chronic inflammation, antigen-driven lymphoproliferation, and hormone induction that promotes epithelial cell proliferation) have been suggested to influence oncogenesis [66]. Also, bacterial infection can lead to the production of toxin and/or carcinogenic metabolites that enhance oncogenesis [67]. In contrast, bacterial infections have also been suggested to play a protective role by altering host physiology and reducing cancer risk [68].",

Similarly, Chlamydophila pneumoniae has been associated with malignant lymphoma and lung cancer in males [74], [75], whereas Candida albicans and Streptococcus anginosus have been linked to oral carcinoma [70]\u2013[76].

In fact, autoantibodies against specific cancer antigens have been identified for several types of tumors, including colon, breast, lung, ovary, prostate, and head and neck. These antibodies have been found to recognize several overexpressed (e.g., Her2), mutated (e.g., p53), or tissue-restricted (e.g., testis-cancer antigens) proteins, which are produced by cancer cells and elicit immune responses [6]. Therefore, detection of such autoantibodies in patient sera could be exploited as a means of cancer diagnosis.

Activation of the coagulation cascade during cancer highlights how altered homeostasis can contribute to tumorigenesis.

Our data indicate that immunoproteomics approach could be a promising application for biomarker discovery and disease progression. Our study could be used as a landmark in a more comprehensive study and can be applied to individual patient serums or to a larger sample size.
