            "text": "The interferon (IFN) system is an integral component of innate immunity and constitutes the first line of defense against viral infection. The antiviral effect of the IFN response is due to the IFN-induced expression of approximately 400 genes, many of which encode proteins that exert antiviral activity [1, 2]. The IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) was identified in a screen for host cell factors modulating influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection [3] and inhibits host cell entry of FLUAV and several other viral pathogens [3\u20135]. Inhibition of viral entry is believed to occur at the stage of hemifusion or fusion pore formation and may entail alterations of the biophysical properties of membranes [6, 7], which in turn may require IFITM/IFITM interactions [8]. Importantly, intact IFITM3 is essential for defense against severe influenza [9, 10], indicating the protein exerts potent antiviral activity in the infected host.",

            "text": "Several lines of evidence suggest that IFITM3 might impact HIV/SIV infection. IFITM3 was shown to inhibit host cell entry of HIV and SIV [11, 12] and to be incorporated into viral particles, which reduces viral infectivity [13\u201315]. Moreover, evidence has been provided that IFITM3 can interfere with the processing of the viral envelope protein (Env) by host cell proteases, which is essential for viral infectivity [16]. Finally, it has been demonstrated that transmitter-founder viruses, which successfully trespass the mucosal barrier and establish HIV infection upon sexual transmission, are highly resistant against inhibition by IFITM3 [17]. The same study also showed that IFITM3 is important for IFN-induced inhibition of HIV infection of cultured primary cells [17]. Collectively, these results indicate that IFITM3 might pose a barrier against sexual transmission of HIV/SIV and might modulate viral spread in the infected host. However, direct proof of a role of IFITM3 in HIV/SIV amplification in the host and in disease progression is still lacking.",

However, none of the 16 polymorphisms significantly modulated peak viral load or disease progression in macaque cohorts experimentally infected with SIV [18]. In the course of our studies, we also identified a rhIFITM3 homologue, termed rhIFITM3(2). The rhIFITM3(2) and rhIFITM3 genes are both located on chromosome 14 and encoded proteins share 91% sequence identity (Fig 1). However, rhIFITM3(2) exhibits two amino acid differences in the highly conserved central part that are also found in huIFITM2, and the protein may thus differ from rhIFITM3 in antiviral activity (Fig 1). Whether rhIFITM3(2) inhibits SIV infection is presently unknown.",

Medium was changed after 6 h and supernatants harvested at 48 h post transfection, passed through 0.45 \u03bcm filters, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. MLV reporter particles pseudotyped with different viral Env proteins for analysis of entry inhibition by IFITM proteins were produced in the same way, using 6 \u03bcg MLV-luc, 3 \u03bcg MLV-gag-pol and 3 \u03bcg of the respective envelope-encoding plasmid. For particles bearing FLUAV surface proteins, 2 \u03bcg of each plasmid, HA and NA, was used. The MLV luc plasmid contains a HCMV enhancer/promoter MLV-LTR (R-U5) control region followed by a VL30 \u2018\u2018gag-less\u201d packaging signal and a full 3\u2019-LTR (U3-R-U5). The LTR elements were derived from Friend murine leukemia virus FB29. The firefly luciferase cDNA under control of the HCMV enhancer/promoter was inserted between packaging signal and 3\u2019LTR.",

Primers for amplification were based upon the Macaca mulatta chromosome 14 scaffold (Mmul_051212) [34], which had been used successfully before in the amplification of cDNAs of rhIFITM3 genes [27]. Amplification of rhIFITM3(2) (LOC697564) was performed with primers mamuIFITM3gen5-1forA (5-TTTGTTCCGCCCTCATCTGG-3) and MamuIFITM3(2)gen3 (5- CTAAGGCAAGAACCTTTGGCG-3). Specific amplification of rhIFITM3(2) sequences by this primer pair was confirmed by sequence anlaysis. Since the forward primer was identical to that used for amplification of the rhIFITM3 gene, we also tested a different forward primer, mamuIFITM3(2)gen5-1for (5-CTGGCCCCGGCCAACTCTGC-3), which contains several mismatches to the rhIFITM3 gene, as forward primer. However, sequencing results of mamuIFITM3(2)gen5-1for/MamuIFITM3(2)gen3 showed no difference to the mamuIFITM3gen5-1forA/MamuIFITM3(2)gen3 amplification, indicating high specificity. Reaction mixtures contained 100 ng genomic DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 100 \u03bcM dNTP mix, 10% betain, 1x HF synthesis buffer and 1 U Phusion DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher). PCR cycling started with 5 min denaturation followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 95\u00b0C), annealing (30 s at 68\u00b0C) and elongation (1 min 40 s at 72\u00b0C) and concluded with 10 min elongation at 72\u00b0C and cooling to 12\u00b0C.

To this end, we incubated four rhesus macaque cell lines, sMAGI, MaMuK/8639, TeloRF and LLC-MK2 with pan-IFN\u03b1 and measured expression of huIFITM3, rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) by qRT-PCR. We found that pan-IFN\u03b1 treatment markedly stimulated expression of two known IFN-stimulated genes, MX1 and ISG56, by at least 100-fold (Fig 2A). Expression of rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) was also increased upon IFN treatment but induction of expression ranged from 3-fold (rhIFITM3) to 10-fold (rhIFITM3(2)). Thus, expression of rhIFITM3(2) is IFN-inducible and might contribute to control of virus infection. Therefore, we next studied whether rhIFITM3(2) can interfere with host cell entry driven by the SIV-Env protein. We transfected 293T cells to express the SIV receptor CD4 and the coreceptor CCR5 and then transduced the cells with vectors encoding human or rhesus macaque IFITM proteins. Subsequently, we transduced the cells with luciferase-encoding murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles bearing SIV-Env. In parallel, we examined particles harboring the Env protein of MLV or the hemagglutinin (HA) of FLUAV, because it is well known that MLV Env-driven entry is largely resistant to inhibition by IFITM3 while FLUAV-HA-mediated entry is highly sensitive [3, 4].",

Why rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) exhibited a slightly different gel migration is presently unknown but might reflect differential posttanslational processing. Expression of huIFITM3 had no impact on transduction mediated by MLV-Env but markedly reduced transduction driven by HA of FLUAV strain A/WSN/33 (Fig 2C), as expected [3]. Moreover, huIFITM3 reduced transduction mediated by the Env proteins of SIVmac239 and its macrophage tropic variant SIVmac316 by about 30%, in agreement with previous studies [12\u201314, 16, 18] (Fig 2C). RhIFITM3 also diminished SIV-Env and FLUAV-HA-driven entry, although with reduced efficiency compared to huIFTIM3, in keeping with our previous findings [18]. Finally, rhIFITM3(2) showed lower but detectable inhibitory activity compared to rhIFITM3 (Fig 2C), potentially due to the reduced expression of the former (Fig 2B).

The rhIFITM3(2) gene is localized on chromosome 14 and contains two exons that give rise to a predicted mRNA of 641 nts (Genbank entry XM_001085331). For the analysis of the rhIFITM3(2) sequence, a PCR strategy was followed that amplified 1360 bp covering the whole transcribed region. Subsequently, PCR products were directly subjected to sequence analysis, which identified 19 polymorphisms (Fig 3). Two of the polymorphisms were located in the coding region of exon 1, three were present in the non-coding region of exon 2 and the remaining polymorphisms were intronic (Fig 3). Most of the polymorphisms located in the non-coding regions were single nucleotide substitutions but insertion and deletion of single bases and, in one instance, five bases were also observed (Table 2). One of the two polymorphisms located in the coding region resulted in an amino acid substitution, T70S. It affected one of the two positions within the conserved central part of IFITMs where rhIFITM3(2) is identical to huIFITM2 but differs from huIFITM3 (which codes for proline at this position). Heterozygosity and major allele frequency were usually both between 0.25 and 0.75, respectively (Table 2). Only one polymorphism (g.1062 T>C) had a low heterozygosity (<10%) and three had a major allele frequency of > 0.90, including c.208 A>T that causes the T70S amino acid exchange.",

We also assessed whether polymorphism 208 A<T, resulting T70S, altered antiviral activity of rhIFITM3(2) in cell culture. However, both rhIFITM3(2)-wt and rhIFITM3(2)-T70S were comparably expressed (Fig 2B) and inhibited MLV-Env, FLUAV-HA and SIV-Env-driven host cell entry with similar efficiency (Fig 2C), although blockade of SIVmac239-316Env-driven entry by rhIFITM3(2)-T70S was somewhat more efficient than that measured for rhIFITM3(2). Thus, T70S may not have an appreciable impact on antiviral activity.

They were also found to progress faster towards AIDS [37]. These findings, although not undisputed (see [38\u201343] for examples), indicates that polymorphisms in huIFITM3 can impact the course of viral infections. This notion has recently been reinforced by the finding that a polymorphism in the huIFITM3 promoter that reduces IFITM3 expression increases the risk for severe influenza [44, 45]. Here, we investigated whether rhIFITM3(2) has antiviral activity and whether polymorphisms in rhIFITM3(2) impact the course of SIV infection. We showed that rhIFITM3(2) inhibits SIV Env-driven entry in cell culture, although not to the same extent as huIFITM3 and rhIFITM3, and that the rhIFITM3 gene is polymorphic. Finally, we provided evidence that polymorphisms in rhIFITM3(2) do not strongly impact the course of SIV infection.",

Similar results were obtained for rhIFITM3(2) but inhibition efficiency was lower than with rhIFITM3. Moreover, blockade of SIV Env-driven entry by rhIFITM3(2) was less efficient than that by rhIFITM3. These differences in antiviral activity could be due to reduced expression of rhIFITM3(2) compared to rhIFITM3 However, it should be noted that an IFITM2 specific antibody was used to detect the proteins analyzed here and it is conceivable that amino acid exchanges present in rhIFITM3(2) altered the antibody epitope. In fact, previous analyses conducted with IFITM3 proteins harboring antigenic tags revealed that rhIFITM3(2) is more efficiently expressed than rhIFITM3[27]. Nevertheless, rhIFITM3(2) was less efficient at inhibiting Ebola virus glycoprotein-driven entry than rhIFITM3 [27].

In the more recently described scaffold Mmul_8.0.1 [46] sequences are switched between rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) in exon 2 and downstream, which we did not observe in our analyses. However, we noted several polymorphisms within the intron sequences that appear to be present in both rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2). As a result, intron sequences from calculated haplotypes of both genes form mixed trees, whereas exon sequences cluster with their respective reference gene. We regard it as unlikely that this mixing is due to PCR artifacts, because additional gene-specific polymorphisms are interspersed between, or close to, these shared polymorphisms.",

They reported the following gene order for the IFITM locus on chromosome 14: IFITM5, IFITM3A, IFITM1, IFITM3 and IFITM3- pseudogene. This order agrees with work by Compton and colleagues [13] and with our own findings [18]. In addition, we noted that IFITM3A and rhIFITM3(2) exhibit a similar genomic localization. However, at the DNA sequence level, the 3\u2019 part (including exon 2) of rhIFITM3(2) (based upon MmuI_051212) and IFITM3A (based upon MmuI_8.0.1, used by Sharma et al) differ by 12 nucleotides within exon 2 (all distinct from the polymorphisms described here). Sequence alignments indicate that in MmuI_8.0.1 the 3\u2019 part of rhIFITM3(2) (based upon MmuI_051212) has been exchanged with rhIFITM3 (based on MmuI_051212). However, our 3\u2019-primer MamuIFITM3(2)gen3 would not be able to bind to this sequence (<65% sequence identity).

In our previous report, we documented conditions for the specific amplification of rhIFITM3 that relied upon high annealing temperature (68\u00b0C) and the exclusion of pseudogenes with a different size than rhIFITM3. These conditions served as a basis for the establishment of the rhIFITM3(2) specific PCR used here, of which the 3\u2019 primer, and for some reactions also the 5\u2019 primer, were adjusted to the rhIFITM3(2) sequence. A side by side comparison of our rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) PCRs confirmed our previously reported rhIFITM3 sequences. Moreover, the sequences amplified by our rhIFITM3(2)-specific PCR were different from those obtained with the rhIFITM3 specific PCR and matched those documented for rhIFITM3(2), confirming that our PCRs were gene-specific.",

Some 16 of the 19 sites were highly polymorphic with a major allele frequency (MAF) of \u2264 75% and homozygous carriers of both alleles were detected. Thus, rhIFITM3(2) is more polymorphic than rhIFITM3, for which 16 polymorphisms were identified of which only six had a MAF \u2264 75%. On the other hand, many polymorphisms of rhIFITM3(2) co-segregate, thereby yielding identical results in the survival and virus load analyses. Of the 19 polymorphisms identified in rhIFITM3(2), 14 were intronic and may thus not affect gene expression. However, an impact of these polymorphisms on RNA stability and pre-mRNA splicing cannot be excluded [48]. In this context, it is noteworthy that none of the polymorphisms altered a splice donor or acceptor sites or a branch point. Five polymorphisms were exonic and two were located in the coding region. One was silent but could nevertheless impact the efficiency of translation and protein folding [49]. The other polymorphism, c.208 A>T, resulted in an amino acid substitution, T70S, and had a MAF of 90%. The T70S exchange is located close to the intramembrane domain 1, the integrity of which has been found to be important for the anti-FLUAV activity of huIFITM3 [8]. However, substitution T70S did not impact expression and antiviral activity of rhIFITM3(2), at least not in transfected cells.",

Analysis of these samples revealed that none of the polymorphisms in rhIFITM3(2) identified in the present study was significantly associated with time to AIDS development or viral load. We cannot exclude that the analysis of a much larger sample size would reveal such associations. However, the impact of the respective polymorphisms on SIV infection is likely to be low and does not appear to appreciably alter the outcome of experimental SIV infection of macaques. In this context it should be noted that all our analyses were conducted with SIV from macaques (SIVmac), which is highly adapted to macaques. It is still possible that non-macaque-adapted SIVsm (SIV from sooty mangabeys, the precursor of SIVmac) is highly sensitive to rhIFITM3 and/or rhIFITM3(2) and that these factors limit cross-species transmission\u2013a scenario that has been described before for TRIM5\u03b1 [50] and that warrants investigation in the case of the IFITM proteins as well. Collectively, this and previous studies suggest that changes in the sequences of rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) are rare and, if they occur at all, do not interfere strongly with antiviral activity, in keeping with the concept that IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes in non-human primates underwent purifying selection [51].",
