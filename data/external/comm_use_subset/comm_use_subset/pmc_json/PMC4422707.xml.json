The causative agent of FMD is the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which is a non-enveloped virus with icosahedral symmetry. The FMDV belongs to the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. It has a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genome that consists of approximately 8,500 bases. The genome is divided into 3 regions, a 5\u2019 non-coding region, a protein-coding region, and a 3\u2019 non-coding region [2]. The protein-coding region can be further divided into the P1, P2, and P3 regions. The P1 region encodes four capsid proteins, and the P2 and P3 regions encode non-structural proteins, including the 2B protein. The research on FMDV non-structural proteins has increased over the last few years, but additional efforts are needed to obtain more information, especially on the 2B protein, which may act as a viroporin.",

In recent years, a growing number of viral proteins have been added to the viroporin family and have garnered significant interest because of their central role in the viral life cycle. Viroporins can oligomerize in host cell membranes to form hydrophilic pores that disrupt the physiological properties of host cells. Viroporins are typically composed of 60\u2013120 amino acids and contain one or two highly hydrophobic domains that can form an amphipathic \u03b1-helix after insertion into the phospholipid bilayer. In addition to their common architecture, viroporins share common functions, such as modifying membrane permeability, disturbing the Ca2+ balance in host cells, and inducing autophagy and apoptosis after expression in cells [3\u20137].",

Regarding the Picornavirus family of viruses, only the 2B proteins of poliovirus and coxsackie virus have been extensively studied. The 2B proteins of poliovirus and coxsackie virus contain two hydrophobic regions, and they can insert themselves into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the Golgi apparatus to modify cellular membrane permeability once they are expressed in host cells [10\u201312]. Additionally, these 2B proteins can disrupt the Ca2+ balance in host cells, inducing apoptosis [13, 14]. However, few reports are available on the 2B protein of FMDV, which belongs to the Picornavirus family.",

The results of this analysis indicated that the 2B protein of FMDV contains two hydrophobic regions and inserts itself into the membrane of the ER with its N- and C-termini oriented towards the cytosol. During expression in host cells, the 2B protein increases the membrane permeability of bacterial and mammalian cells and can increase the Ca2+ content in host cells, thereby inducing autophagy. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the FMDV 2B protein has the same properties as other viroporins, suggesting that the 2B proteins of picornaviruses may play the same role in virus infection.",

Further studies have revealed that the 2B proteins of poliovirus and coxsackie virus are located in the ER or the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, Moffat et al. studied the effects of FMDV 2BC and 3A on the early secretion pathway in infected cells and found that they block the delivery of proteins to the cell surface by interacting with the ER [17]. They also proposed that 2B is associated with the ER in Vero cells. To determine the subcellular localization of the FMDV 2B protein in BHK-21 cells, the recombinant plasmid pEGFPN1-2B, which expresses the GFP-2B fusion protein, was constructed, and the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFPN1 was used as a negative control. ER-Tracker Red, a red fluorescent probe, was used to stain the ER with a specific fluorescence in viable cells. As shown in Fig 2A, the green and red fluorescence did not co-localize in the cells that expressed GFP. However, in the cells that expressed GFP-2B, the green fluorescent GFP protein co-localized with the red fluorescence of the ER, as shown in Fig 2B. This finding suggests that the FMDV 2B protein was mainly located in the ER of cells that overexpressed the protein. Our results are consistent with the findings reported by Moffat et al.",

            "text": "Based on previous studies [16, 18] and the prediction of the transmembrane domain in this study, plasmids were constructed to confirm the topology of the FMDV 2B protein. These plasmids included pXJ-FLAG-2B, which expresses the 2B protein with a FLAG tag fused to the N-terminus; pXJ-2B-HA, which expresses the 2B protein with an HA tag fused to the C-terminus; and pXJ-2B\u0394(aa 110\u2013111), in which a FLAG tag was inserted between aa 110\u2013111. After cells were transfected with these plasmids and subjected to different permeabilization treatments, the tags were detected via IFA using specific antibodies. As shown in Fig 3, no green fluorescence was observed in the untreated cells transfected with the different plasmids, suggesting that these specific antibodies could not pass through the intact plasma membrane into the cells (Fig 3A). After Triton X-100 treatment [19\u201321], green fluorescence was observed in the cells transfected with pXJ-FLAG-2B, pXJ-2B-HA, or pXJ-2B\u0394(aa 110\u2013111), suggesting that Triton X-100 completely permeated the plasma membrane and that the antibodies specifically detected the overexpressed 2B proteins with the corresponding tags (Fig 3B). However, after digitonin treatment [16, 22], green fluorescence was still observed in the cells transfected with pXJ-FLAG-2B or pXJ-2B-HA, but not in the cells transfected with pXJ-2B\u0394(aa110-111) (Fig 3C). This finding suggests that the antibodies could not penetrate the ER membrane after treatment with 0.01 mg/mL digitonin to detect the FLAG tag between the two transmembrane domains. Furthermore, this finding also revealed that the FLAG tag inserted between the two transmembrane domains was located inside the ER membrane with a lumen orientation. These results confirmed that the FMDV 2B protein contains two transmembrane domains, with a cytosolic orientation of the N- and C-termini, as shown in Fig 3D. Therefore, the FMDV 2B protein may be a member of the class IIB viroporins according to its transmembrane topology.",

To confirm the cytotoxicity of the FMDV 2B protein, two bacterial strains, BL21(DE3)pLysS and C43(DE3)pLysS, were used. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS is a widely used impressionable strain; therefore, this strain was used to express the 2B protein as a control. The Escherichia coli C43(DE3)pLysS strain can improve the stability of plasmids during the expression of toxic recombinant proteins [25, 26]. After transformation of the two Escherichia coli strains with the pSUMO and pSUMO-2B plasmids, the expression of the 2B protein was induced using IPTG at different time points. As shown in Fig 4A, both the BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and the C43(DE3)pLysS cells that were transformed with the pSUMO plasmid grew well and demonstrated similar growth tendencies according to the obtained OD600 values. However, a dramatic decrease in cell density occurred in the BL21(DE3)pLysS cells that expressed the 2B protein. In contrast, the density of the C43(DE3)pLysS cells continued to increase. A comparison of the data between pSUMO(BL21) and pSUMO-2B(BL21) and between pSUMO(C43) and pSUMO-2B(C43), showed that there was a significant difference between pSUMO(BL21) and pSUMO-2B(BL21) (p = 0.000, p<0.01) and between pSUMO(C43) and pSUMO-2B(C43) (p = 0.000, p<0.01). Additionally, it also showed that there was a significant difference between pSUMO-2B(BL21) and pSUMO-2B(C43) (p = 0.000, p<0.01). However, there was no difference between pSUMO(BL21) and pSUMO(C43) (p = 0.502, p>0.05). These results suggest that the FMDV 2B protein, but not SUMO, is lytic in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells.",

As previously demonstrated, viroporins can promote the release of virions. To investigate the possible mechanism of virion release, the effects of amantadine on FMDV replication were evaluated [31]. BHK-21 cells were treated with or without amantadine for 30 minutes after infection with FMDV. The supernatant was collected at 4 hours post-infection, diluted from 10-1 to 10-9, and then added to fresh BHK-21 cells. The virus titer (TCID50) was determined after culturing the cells for 72 hours.

The 2B protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli C43(DE3)pLysS strain and purified from the supernatant of bacterial lysates. Then, glutaraldehyde, a widely used cross-linking agent [37], was used to cross-link the 2B oligomers. Fig 6A shows that the His-SUMO protein, which was used as a control, did not oligomerize in the presence of different concentrations of glutaraldehyde (left side). In contrast, the His-SUMO-2B protein oligomerized, and dimer, tetramer and hexamer bands appeared as the glutaraldehyde concentration increased (right side). This result suggests that the purified FMDV 2B protein can oligomerize to form a homomultimer.",

Therefore, the concentration of Ca2+ in BHK-21 cells that express the 2B protein was measured using Fluo-3 AM [40], a fluorescence indicator of intracellular Ca2+. Simultaneously, PI was used to detect changes in membrane integrity [16, 40]. In Fig 7, the Q1 quadrant represents the fluorescence intensity of PI, which indirectly indicates the amount of membrane damage. The Q4 quadrant represents the fluorescence intensity of Fluo-3, which indirectly indicates the concentration of Ca2+. The fluorescence intensity in the Q1 quadrant increased from 0.2% (Fig 7A) to 32.5% (Fig 7B), and the fluorescence intensity in the Q4 quadrant increased from 0.1% (Fig 7A) to 5.2% (Fig 7B). These results suggest host 2B protein expression disrupts membrane integrity and increases the Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm. The data from the Q1 and Q4 quadrants shown in both Fig 7A and 7B are also shown in a histogram for a better comparison of the changes in the Ca2+ content (Fig 7C).",

A study on the NSP4 protein further suggested that autophagy is associated with changes in the Ca2+ content [6]. As our results demonstrated that the FMDV 2B protein increases the Ca2+ content in cells, it would be interesting to determine whether 2B protein expression in host cells induces autophagy by detecting the lipidation of LC3-I to produce LC3-II and the punta formation of LC3 in cells [47]. Cells that were not treated or that were transfected with the pXJ vector were used as a negative control. Cells treated with rapamycin were used as a positive control. All of the cells were collected at 12 hours post-transfection to determine the LC3-I and LC3-II levels by Western blot analysis. Fig 8A shows that the LC3-II band obtained from the cells transfected with pXJ-2B-HA was thick, similar to the band corresponding to the treatment with rapamycin, which is an inducer of autophagy.",

Viroporins are classified into two major groups, class I and class II, depending on whether they contain one or two transmembrane domains [5]. Class I viroporins contain only one transmembrane domain and can be further divided into two subgroups: class IA viroporins, with N-termini that face the organelle lumen and C-termini that face the cytoplasmic matrix, and class IB viroporins, with N-termini that face the cytoplasmic matrix and C-termini that face the organelle lumen. Class II viroporins contain two transmembrane domains and are further divided into two subgroups: class IIA viroporins, with both the N-terminus and C-terminus extending into the organelle lumen, and class IIB viroporins, with both the N-terminus and C-terminus extending into the cytoplasmic matrix. In this study, the FMDV 2B protein was predicted to have two hydrophobic regions and was located in the ER. Additionally, this protein exhibited a transmembrane topology similar to that of class IIB viroporins. These results suggest that this protein shares characteristics with viroporins. However, a definitive identification of the domains and function of the two transmembrane regions requires further study.",

However, it is difficult to express the FMDV 2B protein in a prokaryote because of the high hydrophobicity of the protein. Fortunately, SUMO fusion technology overcomes this obstacle [52].

It is well established that FMDV infection is highly sensitive to weak bases that increase endosomal pH. Treatment with amantadine may result in alkalinization of endosomes where FMDV pH-mediated uncoating takes place, thus inhibiting infection. To avoid the pH increase caused by amantadine, we used 1-amantadine hydrochloride instead of amantadine to maintain a weakly acidic pH. Because amantadine inhibited the replication of FMDV, we speculated that amantadine abolished the pore-forming activity of the 2B protein. To verify this proposal, the interactions between 2B protein monomers were analyzed in cells and in vitro. Monomer interactions, which may contribute to the pore-forming property of this protein, were detected. In the previous experiment, 2B protein was detected at 2\u20132.5 h post-infection by immunofluorescence staining. However, no 2B protein expression was detected at different times post-transfection with plasmid pRSV-2B, neither by Western blotting nor by immunofluorescence. This difference may due to cell toxicity. The detection of transient 2B expression has been reported using a modified 2B that included a tag motif [57]. The results were consistent with our findings. We found that the 2B protein changed the cell morphology from fusiform to round and that the cells subsequently died (data not shown), most likely due to the pore-forming activity of the protein. A TEM assay may be needed to further evaluate the ion channel formed by the 2B protein [58].",

Autophagy is a necessary balancing process, which degrades and reuses intracellular components in response to nutritional deficiencies and other stresses, including viral infection [60, 61]. This study demonstrated that autophagy was upregulated in cells that expressed the FMDV 2B protein at high levels. The disrupted Ca2+ levels may have contributed to the increase in autophagy. Adenosine 5\u2019-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical protein kinase that induces autophagy, and the phosphorylation of AMPK is regulated by Ca2+. An increased Ca2+concentration first activates Ca2+/calmodulin dependency kinase kinase beta (CaMKK-\u03b2), an upstream regulator of AMPK. Then, CaMKK-\u03b2 induces AMPK phosphorylation, and autophagy occurs [62, 63]. The role of the FMDV 2B protein in this process should be further investigated. In summary, the findings of this study suggest that the FMDV 2B protein exhibits viroporin-like properties and may play an important role in FMDV infection. Additional studies using novel technologies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of the FMDV 2B protein.",
