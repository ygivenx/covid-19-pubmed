Rapid transmission, high infectivity and unpredictable\nclinical progression with a fatality ratio of approximately 9.6% made SARS a\nglobal threat in 2003. However, the pathogenesis of this infectious agent is still\nnot fully understood. Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV infections, which\nrepresent more than 10% of all SARS-CoV infections, have been reported in\nmany places, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Guangdong Province of China, and\nSingapore[4]\u2013[8]. Clinical and laboratory\ninvestigations have shown that the host genetic background is an important factor\nthat determines the susceptibility to and pathogenicity of SARS infection. We have\ndemonstrated that genetic haplotypes associated with low serum mannose-binding\nlectin (MBL) are also associated with SARS, and our findings were\nconfirmed by other independent studies [9], [10]. Other susceptible genes, including\nchemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) [11], interferon gamma (IFN\n\u03b3) [12], 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase 1\n(OAS) and myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) [13], have also been\nreported. The involvement of the major histocompatibility complex class I gene\n(HLA) [14]\u2013[16] and the L-SIGN gene (CLEC4M) [17]\u2013[19] are still\ndisputed.",

Finally, we chose to genotype rs2248690 (5\u2032-flanking region),\nrs2077119 (5\u2032-flanking region), rs4917 (exon 6), rs2593813 (intron 1) and\nrs4918 (exon 7) in the AHSG gene. The genotyping and statistical results are\npresented in Table S1 and Table\nS2 under the dominant and additive models, respectively.\nThe genotyping and statistical analyses of the Guangzhou non-HCW population\nrevealed that two tag SNPs were associated with SARS.

Because the Beijing and\nGuangzhou sample groups had homogenous demographic and genetic parameters (Han\nChinese), a joint analysis was performed. The combined analysis of the two\nstudies under the dominant model is presented in Table\nS3. After combining data from the two cohorts, the\nTT/AT genotype of rs2248690 had a frequency of 27.5%\nin the control population and a significantly higher frequency of 39.1%\nin the SARS patients (OR = 1.70; 95% CI,\n1.37\u20132.09; \nTable\n2\n\n and Table S3).

Because rs4917 and\nrs2248690 are in high linkage disequilibrium (0.62), the association between\nrs4917 and SARS can be easily understood. A logistic regression analysis was\napplied to adjust the linkage between rs4917 and rs2248690. The result showed\nthat rs2248690 was associated with SARS development\n(OR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16\u20132.17;\np = 0.004), while rs4917 was not\nassociated with SARS (p = 0.54).

Though the\nP-value is higher than 0.05, the distribution of different\ngenotypes between the HCW cases and HCW controls is similar to the distribution\nbetween the non-HCW cases and non-HCW controls with a difference of\napproximately 10%. The statistical analysis of the rs2248690 genotype\ndata from all cases and HCW controls confirmed this finding\n(OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.38\u20132.06; \nTable 4\n).

The current literature suggests that the availability of\nAHSG to macrophages is critical in regulating the innate immune response in tissue\ninjury and infection because AHSG is required for macrophage deactivation by\nendogenous cations [37]. Decreased levels of human fetuin have been observed in\npatients with acute lymphocytic Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas,\nrheumatoid arthritis, acute alcoholic hepatitis and trauma [28], [38]\u2013[41]. Under conditions where\nmacrophage-associated fetuin levels are decreased, macrophage deactivation by\nendogenous counter-regulators may be impaired, leading to the uncontrolled\noverproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [29], [38]. A recent work showed that\nmice deficient in AHSG are hypersensitive to LPS-induced inflammation [27]. Because the\ndevelopment of SARS is always associated with a severe inflammatory reaction, low\nAHSG serum levels could result in severe symptoms after a SARS-CoV infection.\nConsidering that there might be many asymptomatic SARS-CoV infections in the control\ngroup, it is plausible that relatively higher serum concentrations of AHSG can\norchestrate an unimpaired counter-regulation between macrophage deactivation and\nendogenous pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, viruses can be cleared without\nsevere inflammation and obvious symptoms. However, we observed that AHSG interacts\nwith the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (\nFigure 1\n), which may induce massive pro-inflammatory\ncytokine production upon infection [21]. AHSG may neutralize the pro-inflammatory effect of the\nSARS nucleocapsid protein because AHSG is so abundant in the serum (0.2\u20130.55\nmg/ml). Considering that AHSG is a circulating glycoprotein synthesized in human\nliver tissue and the nucleocapsid protein is \u201cwrapped\u201d by membrane\nproteins in the SARS-CoV virion, interactions between AHSG and the nucleocapsid\nprotein are less likely to affect the viral infectivity and replication of the\nSARS-CoV.",
