Importantly, in naturally infected humans, the presence of DVGs correlates with enhanced antiviral immune responses during RSV infection [6] and reduced disease severity in influenza virus infection [8]. Significant effort is currently invested in harnessing DVGs as antivirals due to their strong immunostimulatory activity and ability to interfere with the replication of the standard virus. However, despite over 50 years of appreciating their critical functions in multiple aspects of viral infections, the molecular mechanisms that drive DVG generation remain largely unknown. This lack of understanding hampers our ability to effectively harness DVGs for therapeutic purposes and limits our capacity to generate tools to elucidate their mechanism of action and impact during specific viral infections.",

            "text": "There are two major types of DVGs: deletion and copy-back (cb) [10]. Both types are unable to complete a full replication cycle without the help of a co-infecting full-length virus [11, 12] and can be packaged to become part of the viral population [13]. Deletion DVGs, common in influenza virus and positive strand RNA viruses, retain the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ends of the viral genomes but carry an internal deletion [14\u201316]. These types of DVGs are believed to arise from recombination events [17, 18] and can strongly interfere with the standard virus [19]. cbDVGs are common products of non-segmented negative sense (nns) RNA virus replication, including Sendai virus (SeV), measles virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and are the primary stimulators of the innate immune response during nnsRNA virus infection [6, 7, 20, 21]. cbDVGs arise when the viral polymerase detaches from its template at a \u201cbreak point\u201d and resumes elongation at a downstream \u201crejoin point\u201d by copying the 5\u2019 end of the nascent daughter strand [12, 22]. This process results in the formation of a new junction sequence and a truncated genome flanked by reverse complementary ends [23]. cbDVGs have long been thought to result from errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during replication due to a combination of lack of proofreading activity and the presence of a polymerase with lower replication fidelity [12]. No pattern or specific sequences for the break and rejoin points of cbDVGs have been reported so far.",

Upon identification of cbDVG populations generated during infection, we show that specific viral sequences within the viral genome are preferred sites for cbDVG generation and that these sequences are conserved across viral strains. Utilizing this knowledge, we generated a recombinant virus that produced a restricted set of cbDVGs, serving as strong evidence that specific sequences dictate where cbDVGs are generated. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that common cbDVGs are generated independently in natural infections in humans, further supporting an orchestrated origin for cbDVGs.",

The principle of this Viral Opensource DVG Key Algorithm (VODKA) is illustrated in Fig 1A. In brief, the break point (T\u2019) and the rejoin point (W) are far apart in the parental viral genome, but in cbDVGs they become continuous and form the new cbDVG junction sequence when the viral polymerase (Vp) is released from the template and rejoins in the nascent strand. Since cbDVG junction sequences are absent in the full-length viral genome, VODKA identifies the sequence reads that capture junction sequences and then filters out false-positives reads that fully align to the reference genome.",

By aligning cbDVG junction reads to the SeV full-length antisense genome, we determined the location of the major break and rejoin regions (blue peaks in the upper panel of Fig 1C). Each read that aligned to a break or rejoin region contained two portions, one of which fully aligned to the reference genome. The aligned reads in the break region (pink box, Fig 1C) and in the rejoin region (gray box, Fig 1C) corresponded to the DVG-546 sequence before the break point and after the rejoin point, respectively. The breakpoint for DVG-546 predicted by VODKA (14932\u00b11_15292\u00b11) exactly matched the one identified by Sanger sequencing (\u2191 in Fig 1C), thereby establishing the efficiency and accuracy of VODKA in identifying cbDVG-specific sequences.",

RSV is a virus known to generate immunostimulatory cbDVGs in infected patients [6], and thus a subject of interest in our laboratory. We analyzed pooled RNA-seq datasets from six RSV-infected cell cultures. These cultures were infected with RSV generated from the same parental stock (strain A2) that was first depleted of DVGs and then passaged independently in different cell lines to generate six different stocks enriched for DVGs. The presence of cbDVGs in these infections was confirmed using a specific RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. By aligning VODKA-identified cbDVG junctions to the RSV A2 reference antigenome, we observed 4 major break hotspots spanning over 1300 nucleotides (red down-facing arrows in Fig 1D). In contrast, only 2 major rejoin hotspots were observed within a narrower region of 223 nucleotides in length at the 3\u2019end of the viral genome (black down-facing arrows in Fig 1D). Remarkably, the rejoin area with the highest peak included counts present in all six virus stocks. We then compared these break and rejoin hotspots to those generated in infections with a different stock of RSV enriched in cbDVGs (stock7) from which the major cbDVGs were identified upon Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons. We observed that the cbDVG rejoin points from stock7 were located within the strongest rejoin hotspot, whereas its four break points were distributed more broadly across the genome (Fig 1D). These results reveal strong hotspots for the polymerase to rejoin during cbDVG formation and suggest a large degree of conservation of the RSV cbDVGs rejoin positions.",

We constructed an RSV minigenome backbone (BKB) that included the reporter gene mKate2 for flow cytometry quantification of transcripts produced by the viral polymerase. In addition, the minigenome BKB included restriction enzyme sites to insert the selected Break1 and/or Rejoin1 regions (Fig 2A). The goal was to use this system to establish whether sequences in the candidate break and rejoin regions altered the polymerase elongation capacity, eventually leading to the generation of cbDVGs. The strategy used for detection of cbDVGs is illustrated in S1 Fig. As illustrated in Fig 2B, in this system mKate2 expression should only occur if the viral polymerase replicates the entire minigenome sequence from the trailer to the leader. Co-transfection of the minigenome construct with the four helper plasmids expressing the polymerase proteins (L, P, NP, and M2-1), resulted in mKate2 expression in 8\u201317% of the cells, whereas no mKate2 expression was detected in control transfections that lacked the viral polymerase (Fig 2C; -Vp). Constructs containing only the Rejoin1 sequence led to similar mKate2 expression as the BKB construct, whereas constructs containing Break1 caused a ~30% reduction in mKate2 expression (Fig 2D and 2E). We verified that the difference in mKate2 expression among transfections with different constructs was not due to variable transfection efficiency (S2A\u2013S2C Fig), or cell death (S2D Fig). These results are consistent with the concept that during cbDVG generation, the viral polymerase falls off the template at the break region leading to a reduced amount of newly synthetized template available for mKate2 transcription.",

We also observed two major amplicons (white arrowheads in Fig 3C), both of which were absent in cells transfected with the construct bearing Break1 alone. These two amplicons contained cbDVGs that were confirmed by conventional Sanger sequencing (S3A Fig). The individual break and rejoin points of these minigenome-generated cbDVGs are indicated in Fig 3D. Interestingly, the rejoin points clustered in close proximity to the rejoin points that we identified from in vitro infected cells.

To avoid affecting the L \u201cgene end\u201d signal and the genome trailer region, we chose to mutate six nucleotides at the beginning of this rejoin region (nucleotide positions 191\u2013186 from the 3\u2019 end of antigenome) to either all Us (named GC>Us) or all GCs (named AU>GCs). We then used RT-PCR (DI-1/DI-R primer set) to detect cbDVG-like fragments formed in the cells co-transfected with all U\u2019s or all GCs mutant constructs and polymerase-expressing plasmids, as described earlier. Mutant GC>Us generated a dominant amplicon (lane2, Fig 4B) that was absent in cells transfected with mutant AU>GCs (lane4, Fig 4B). From sequencing PCR products within the areas marked by asterisks in Fig 4B, we identified five distinct rejoin points from mutant AU>GCs and three from mutant GC>Us (\u2191 in Fig 4C). Compared to WT Pair1, mutant GC>Us did not generate rejoin points proximal to the mutated region (grey area in Fig 4C), whereas mutant AU>GCs still produced cbDVG-like fragments at the mutated area.",

Transfections with mutant GC>Us resulted in one strong amplicon while no predominant amplicon was observed in transfections with mutant AU>GCs (Fig 4D), agreeing with results obtained using the DI-F1 primer set. Sequencing confirmed that the strong amplicons produced by all three different primer sets in transfections with mutant GC>Us were analogous cbDVG-like fragments and shared their break and rejoin points (sequence in S3 Fig, DVG 303bp). To examine if the observed lack of a predominant product resulting from mutant AU>GCs was due to a general reduction of replication ability of the viral polymerase induced by mutations, we introduced the same mutations in the construct with Rejoin1 alone and examined mKate2 expression by flow cytometry. We found no significant differences between Rejoin1 and the two mutants, Rejoin1-GC>Us and Rejoin1-AU>GCs. Neither of these constructs reduced mKate2 expression compared to BKB (S4 Fig), suggesting that the function of the RSV minigenome system remained intact despite of the mutations.

Transfection of the C186U, but not the C188U construct, resulted in one major DVG amplicon (indicated with an asterisk in Fig 4E; sequences in S3 Fig). The C186U construct rejoin points skipped the mutation area and concentrated in the early trailer region, similar to GC>Us. This was confirmed by the two other primer sets. A strong band shown in lane C188U at a high molecular weight (indicated with an arrowhead in Fig 3E) was determined to not correspond to a cbDVG by Sanger sequencing.

As shown in Fig 5A, cells infected with gRSV-FR-GC>Us expressed the same level of mKate2 protein as cells infected with the WT reporter virus (gRSV-FR-WT) at 72 h post infection. Both viruses began to generate cbDVGs at passage 3 (P3) and the pattern of cbDVGs was maintained, and became stronger, by P5 (Fig 5B). We verified that P5 gRSV-FR-GC>Us still carried the mutations we introduced (Fig 5C). Interestingly, gRSV-FR-WT produced 4 major DVGs, whereas gRSV-FR-GC>Us only generated one dominant cbDVG (asterisks in Fig 5B, confirmed sequence in S3G and S3H Fig), which is consistent with results from the minigenome system. The dominant cbDVG generated in cells infected with gRSV-FR-GC>Us rejoined at the early trailer region and skipped the mutation site, similar to what was observed in the minigenome system. Cells infected with gRSV-FR-WT produced one cbDVG that rejoined within the mutation site and three other cbDVGs that rejoined at the same region of the mutant virus (Fig 4D). A population of cbDVGs lacking generation at the mutation site can be repeatedly observed upon independent passages of the mutant virus, albeit the specific species of DVGs varied in different lineages (S5 Fig).

Alignment of both sequences revealed one natural mutation in RSV Line 19 that introduced three GCs right at the beginning of the trailer sequence, which are not present in RSV A2 (sequence indicated with a red horizontal line in Fig 5D). The increased GC content in this position in Line 19 likely explains why gRSV-FR-WT generates more cbDVGs at this location than RSV A2 stocks1-7. Regardless of this natural preference for rejoining in the early trailer, gRSV-FR-GC>Us diminished the rejoin signal at the mutation site as no cbDVGs rejoin points were found at this location resulting in less diversity of cbDVG generation compared to the WT virus. Overall, these data confirm that the common rejoin region sequence tested in the minigenome system determines cbDVG rejoining during RSV infection and that the content of C nucleotides, and possibly G nucleotides, in this region critically determines the site of cbDVG rejoin.",

A total of 10 clinical specimens were sequenced; 4 were classified as DVG-low and 6 as DVG-high based on semi-quantification following cbDVG PCR. VODKA outputs were aligned to the reference genome of an RSV strain A isolate (Reference genome NCBIKJ672447, 2012) and showed that, consistent with previous cbDVG-RT-PCR results, samples from DVG-low patients (upper panel in Fig 6A) contained ~8 fold less cbDVG junction reads than DVG-high patients (lower panel in Fig 6A). In addition, coverage mapping showed the presence of multiple break and rejoin regions. Some of them were a mix of both break points and rejoin points (Fig 6A, read and black arrows). The rejoin points were particularly noteworthy because the majority of them clustered within one narrow AU-rich \u201cRejoin1+ Trailer\u201d region (red ticks in Fig 6B) similar to that identified in in vitro infections (blue ticks in Fig 6B). According to the frequency of different cbDVG junction positions, we illustrated the top 6 major cbDVGs (one of them is a snap-back) in Fig 6C (details summarized in Table 1, Break Rejoin position shown as T\u2019_W). All of them were found in multiple patients (Fig 6C and Table 1). The most abundant cbDVG again had the rejoin point within the \u201cRejoin1+Trailer\u201d region, despite of a higher diversity of rejoin points compared to in vitro infection. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a conserved rejoin region drives the generation of most cbDVGs during RSV infection in vitro and in vivo and that identical RSV cbDVGs are generated in different naturally infected individuals.",

Historically, DVGs were thought to result from random errors introduced by the viral polymerase during replication. However, mounting evidence indicates that the generation of cbDVGs is not totally stochastic. Specifically, we show that during RSV infection discrete hotspots in the viral genome mark sites for the viral polymerase to release and rejoin during cbDVG formation, both in vitro and during natural RSV infections in humans. Moreover, we show that the content of C nucleotides, and possibly G nucleotides, within the major rejoin hotspot critically impacts the generation of cbDVGs at that position. We also identified specific nucleotides that, when mutated, altered the ability of recombinant viruses to generate diverse species of DVGs. The identification of a specific sequence involved in cbDVG formation opens the unprecedented possibility of genetically manipulating the content of cbDVGs during infection. This possibility may significantly impact our ability to generate tools to further understand the role of these viral products in virus pathogenesis, as well as potentially manipulate the cbDVG content with antiviral and/or therapeutic purposes.",

VODKA outputs were consistent with previous results obtained using classic DVG-RT-PCR and demonstrated a higher sensitivity in the detection of cbDVGs both in vitro and in clinical samples. False-positive DVG junction reads were ruled out by screening all reads aligned to the host (reads from human transcriptome) using VODKA. This test resulted in a minimal number of hits compared to viral samples, adding to the evidence reported throughout this manuscript to support the specificity of cbDVG detection by VODKA. VODKA can successfully identify cbDVGs in a number of viruses, including SeV (Fig 1), offering a powerful tool for cbDVG detection in clinical samples. Furthermore, since cbDVGs, compared to other types DVGs, have the most potent immunostimulatory function, VODKA can be used to identify candidates for development of novel cbDVG-based adjuvants.",

One C nucleotide substitution alone can influence the location of the DVG rejoin point implying that a strong rejoin signal likely needs an optimal number of C, and possibly G nucleotides, in specific locations. However, the total amount of cbDVGs produced and their immunostimulatory activity are not necessarily altered by the single C substitution in one rejoin hotspot, suggesting the redundancy of rejoin hotspots in cbDVG generation. More research needs to be done to investigate whether mutations in other rejoin hotspots or in combination will alter the overall amount of cbDVGs and their function. Interestingly, the same differential distribution of cbDVG rejoin points was observed when we compared cbDVG generation from infections with RSV A2 and Line19, which differ in their GC content at the beginning of the trailer region. This observation also implies that the preference of usage among different hotspots as cbDVG rejoin points may vary among different RSV subtypes. In addition, our data suggest that rejoin sequences influence the function of break signals when inserted as pairs in the construct. Our data is in agreement with data from in vitro infections with measles virus lacking the C protein, where break points of cbDVGs were widely distributed along the genome, whereas the rejoin points were clustered in a narrow region close to 5\u2019 end of the genome [25].",

A lower density of nucleocapsid proteins (NPs) at certain genomic locations has been shown to result in increased cbDVG formation in SeV infection [26]. However, the mutations described to be responsible for low NP density were absent in our SeV stocks, suggesting that alternative mechanisms are likely involved. The usage of C nucleotides as a signal closely resembles the recognition of \u201cgene end\u201d or \u201cgene start\u201d by the viral polymerase when working on transcription [27, 28] and it would be intriguing to evaluate if the mechanisms of cbDVG generation and viral RNA transcription are related. Another factor influencing DVG accumulation is their length, which is tightly related to the spatial structure of the viral RNPs. In paramyxoviruses, although it is thought that \u201conly genomes with hexametric or heptametric lengths are efficiently replicated\u201d [29, 30], some cbDVGs generated in vitro do not obey this rule [25, 31, 32]. For RSV, we observed that a number of cbDVGs do not follow the rule of six or seven. Nonetheless, cbDVGs with certain length may have increased replication efficiency and thus an enhanced fitness advantage. Interestingly, in our minigenome system, although cbDVGs from Pair1 contained the expected rejoin point positions, break points frequently fell into a region further ahead of Break1, suggesting that the distance between the Break and Rejoin points may also play a role in determining where the break position is.",

Mutations in non-structural protein 2 of influenza have also been shown to increase the de novo generation of DVGs by altering the fidelity of viral polymerase [34]. Host factors may be essential contributors to DVG generation as well [10]. For example, vesicular stomatitis virus produces a large amount of snap-back DVGs in most cell lines, except human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, and this cellular attribute was mapped to human chromosome 16 [35]. Similarly, infection with measles virus did not show de novo generation of defective interfering particles (DIPs) in human WI-38 cells and SeV did not produce cbDVGs in chicken embryo lung cells [36, 37]. Despite the potential importance of these additional factors on DVG generation, the current work represents a major paradigm shift with the identification of sequences that regulate cbDVG formation.",

Detailed information of the constructs can be found in reference [40]. The backbone plasmid of the RSV minigenome used for testing various DVG junction regions was constructed by cloning two regions of sequences amplified from pSynkRSV-line19F into the pSl1180 vector. The first region included a T7 promoter, a hammerhead ribozyme, RSV leader sequence, and genes encoding monomeric Katushka 2 (mKate2), while the second region included the RSV trailer sequence, a Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and a T7 terminator. These regions were sequentially cloned into psl1180 vector using restriction enzyme pairs SpeI/SandI and SandI/EcoRI, respectively. The potential cbDVG break and/or rejoin regions (positions in S1 Table) were then inserted between those two regions using restriction enzyme pairs NotI/SandI and SandI/SpaI, respectively. A detailed scheme of the construct can be seen in Fig 2A. Pair1 and Rejoin1 mutations were introduced using the site-directed mutagenesis commercial kit QuickChange II XL (Agilent, CA) according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol.

Therefore, starting with the last 3kb of a reference viral genome, we built an index of potential DVG sequences by taking all possible combinations of two non-overlapping segments of L bases, where L is the read length. The segments are linked by reverse complementing the second segment (C-D) and adding the first segment (A-B) to it (S6 Fig). Sequenced reads are aligned to the potential DVGs using bowtie2 [44], and subsequently undergo two filtering steps. First, reads are removed unless they map across a breakpoint (A_C) with at least 15bp of mapped segment on each side. Second, the reads that map cleanly to the reference genome are filtered out. This pipeline gives the output read counts for each breakpoint (A_C). To be consistent with the structure of copy-back DVGs in Fig 1A, A is equivalent to break point T\u2019 and C is equivalent to rejoin point W. VODKA output reads were further aligned to reference viral genomes (RSV A2: NCBI accession number KT992094.1; RSV 2012 clinical isolate: NCBI accession number KJ672447) or known SeV DVG-546 to identify the potential DVG junction regions using the Geneious 7.0 software.",

All constructs were generated in a pSl1180 vector and included three restriction enzyme sites that were used for ligating Break1 and Rejoin1 as indicated. The length of all minigenome constructs after T7 promoter and before T7 terminator obeyed the rule of six. Red arrows indicate the primers that were used for detecting cbDVGs by PCR. One primer was within the viral trailer and the other primer was designed against the 3\u2019 end of the break region. (B) Workflow of the RSV minigenome system. BSR-T7 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding the polymerase genes M2-1, L, NP, P, and the minigenome construct to be tested. The minigenome was then transcribed by the T7 polymerase generating a template for amplification by the viral polymerase. If the paired junction region was not functional, the viral polymerase continued to elongate from 3\u2019 TrC to the 5\u2019 LeC, exposing the promoter in Le for transcription leading to mKate2 expression. If break and rejoin sequences were functional, the viral polymerase recognized those signals resulting in dropping off from the template, generation of cbDVG-like fragments, and reduction of mKate2 expression. Since DVG junctions are split into two non-continuous regions (break and rejoin) in the minigenome plasmid, detection of the end-to-end DVG junction regions via DI-RT-PCR is a second indication of a productive junction region.

All seq reads that passed the quality threshold were analyzed by VODKA to screen for cbDVG junctions. DVG junction reads were then aligned to the RSV reference genome NCBI KJ672447. Blue histogram shows a synopsis of total coverage at any given position of the RSV reference genome (illustrated by the y-axis). The number on the right side of the graph represents the total reads at the position with highest coverage. (B) AU-content (top, purple) within nucleotides 14700\u201315109 of the RSV strain A isolate KJ642247 (human samples) is plotted centered on a 40 base-pair sliding window in both plots. Grey box indicated the position of Rejoin1 and Trailer. Individual rejoin points identified by DVG junction reads from pediatric samples within this region are represented by red ticks underneath the graph. The rejoin points from in vitro infection of RSV stocks 1\u20136 are plotted using blue ticks. The darker color represented increased rejoin frequency at a given position. (C) Top 6 major DVGs identified from clinical samples are depicted by dashed lines that join their break points (red arrows) and rejoin points (black arrows).
