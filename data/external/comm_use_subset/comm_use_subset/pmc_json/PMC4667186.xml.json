However, along with contrasting results in the strength of DC subset depletion202122232425, it was recently reported that CD11c-DTR mice showed side effect such as systemic neutrophilia after DT injection to deplete CD11c+ DCs2223. Because the majority of published literatures used 8\u201311 ng/g DT to deplete CD11c+ DCs202122232425, the injection doses of DT were carefully titrated to achieve selective depletion of CD11chi DCs. While the injection of low DT dose (2 ng/g) provided selective depletion of CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs with slightly increased CD11cintPDCA-1hi pDC frequency and number, the injection of higher DT dose (10 and 25 ng/g) depleted CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs as well as CD11cintPDCA-1hi pDCs (Fig. S1A-B). To better understand the depletion of CD11chi DCs, we analyzed the frequency and total number of DC subsets (CD11chiCD8\u03b1+, CD11chiCD11b+, CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo, and CD11cintPDCA-1hi pDC) after DT injection (2 ng/g). Our data revealed that subpopulations of CD11chi DCs, but not CD11cintPDCA-1hi pDCs, were selectively depleted by DT (2 ng/g) injection (Fig. S1C-D). Also, the major populations of other lymphoid and myeloid cells in spleen, blood, and bone marrow (BM), including B (CD3\u2212CD19+), NK (CD3\u2212NK1.1+) cells, and CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes, were not affected by DT (2 ng/g) injection (Fig. S2A\u2013C). Furthermore, a repetitive systemic injection of such titrated DT (2 ng/g) did not cause systemic neutrophilia2223 as well as any apparent changes in body weight, signs of illness, or long-term defects during monitoring periods that ranged from 7 to 10 days (Fig. S3A\u2013C).",

            "text": "Using this selective depletion model of CD11chi DCs, we evaluated the impact of CD11chi DCs on JE progression (Fig. 1A). CD11chi DC-depleted mice succumbed to JE with 100% mortality, whereas vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed around 50% mortality. Also, CD11chi DC-depleted mice showed more rapid development of neurological disorder (paralysis) started from 3\u20134 dpi by up to 100% rate (Fig. 1B), and severely reduced body weight (Fig. 1C), as compared to vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice. Although any side effects such as neutrophilia, changes of body weight, and signs of illness were not shown by DT (2 ng/g) injection, we also used B6 recipients reconstituted by BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR mice to rule out residual side effect2425. Consistently, CD11c-DTR BM recipients showed 100% mortality, faster neurological signs, and marked reduction of body weight following depletion of CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs by DT (2 ng/g) injection (Fig. S4A\u2013C). Additionally, we determined viral RNA levels in lymphoid (spleen) and inflammatory CNS tissues (brain and spinal cord) (Fig. 1D). CD11chi DC ablation provided increased viral burden in lymphoid and CNS tissues. Of note, the inflammatory CNS tissues (brain and spinal cord) of CD11chi DC-depleted mice contained viral burden with 100- to 1,000-fold increased levels 4 and 5 dpi, but not 2 and 3 dpi. These results indicate that selective ablation of CD11chi DCs provides enhanced susceptibility to JE and facilitates the increase of viral burden in CNS tissues.",

The infiltrated populations of granulocytes (CD11b+Ly-6Ghi) were comparable between vehicle- and DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice in frequency and absolute number following JEV infection (Fig. 1E,F). In contrast, CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes were prominently infiltrated in the CNS of DC-ablated mice with a 10-fold increase over vehicle-treated mice. Notably, the absolute number of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes increased 3- to 4-fold in DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, based on the CNS myeloid cell classification of Ford et al.26, we enumerated resting microglia (CD11bintCD45int) and activated microglia/macrophages (CD11bhiCD45hi) in the CNS at 3 dpi. The proportions (Fig. 1G) and absolute numbers (Fig. 1H) of resting microglia and activated microglia/macrophages were increased in CD11chi DC-depleted mice. Of note, activated microglia/macrophages (CD11bhiCD45hi) were detected at a 10-fold increased level in CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DC-depleted mice. Also, CD11b+CD45\u2212 leukocytes containing many Ly-6C+Ly-6G\u2212F4/80int cells were detected in the brain of CD11chi DC-ablated mice with increased levels, compared to vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice.",

Significantly, CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DC-depleted mice had early recruitment of inflammatory cells into the brain, compared to vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice after JEV infection (Fig. 2A\u2013F). The majority of infected cells were observed to be neuron cells, since prominent costaining was observed between neuronal marker MAP-2 and the JEV antigen (Fig. 2G). Of note, a higher frequency of JEV antigen was detected in the brains of DC-ablated mice. In contrast, no costaining was detected between GFAP+ astrocytes and JEV antigen, indicating that astrocytes were not infected with JEV (Fig. 2H). Finally, a small subset of CD11b+ myeloid cells costained positively with JEV antigen, and enhanced frequencies of JEV-infected CD11b+ cells were observed in CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DC-depleted mice (Fig. 2I). Taken together, these results indicate that CD11chi DCs are essential for the control of neuroinflammatory progression in immune-privileged CNS following JEV infection.",

Therefore, we examined the expression of cytokines and chemokines in inflammatory tissues. We found that the ablation of CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs provided greatly enhanced expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in the spleen and in the CNS, including brain and spinal cord (Fig. 2J). Of note, increases in the expression levels of CC chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5) in the immune-privileged CNS of DC-ablated mice preceded the increases in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CXC chemokines, suggesting that early expression of CC chemokines may induce infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS of DC-ablated mice. We also measured the levels of systemic IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the serum of JEV-infected mice at 3 dpi. Trends toward increased levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were observed in the serum of CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DC-depleted mice (Fig. 2K). Collectively, these results indicate that CD11chi DC ablation exacerbates neuroinflammation along with greater expression of CC chemokines to provide early CNS-infiltration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes.",

            "text": "The debatable contribution of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes to immunopathology in the immune-privileged CNS has not been clearly defined56789101112. The present finding implies that early infiltration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes could be associated with severe neuroinflammatory reactions in immune-privileged CNS of CD11chi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, since DC and monocytes share a common lineage during differentiation from HSCs1415, it is presumable that CD11chi DC ablation affects the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes during JE. To address this issue, we explored the impact of CD11chi DCs on the function and differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes during JE progression. Splenic CD11b+Ly-6Ghi neutrophils showed comparable levels in the presence or absence of CD11chi DCs, on evaluation of the expression levels of several molecules related to antigen presentation (CD40, CD62L, CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II), chemokine receptors (CCR2, CXCR2), and other differentiation markers (Ly-6C, Gr-1, F4/80). However, the expression levels of CD40, CD62L, CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II, and F4/80 in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes were decreased by CD11chi DC ablation (Fig. S5A). Notably, down-regulation of CD40, CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II, and F4/80 in CD11b+Ly-6Chigh monocytes of DC-ablated mice was more apparent after JEV infection, compared to those of JEV-infected CD11c-DTR mice that were not injected with DT. In line with this result, the expression levels of CD40, CD62L, CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II, and F4/80 in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes infiltrated into immune-privileged CNS were markedly decreased in DC-ablated mice (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the expression levels of chemokine receptors CXCR2 in Ly-6Chi monocytes and Ly-6Ghi granulocytes were not significantly changed by CD11chi DC-depletion, whereas increased expression of CCR2 molecule was observed in CNS-infiltrated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes of CD11chi DC-depleted mice (MFI 440 \u00b1 51 vs 387 \u00b1 77) (Fig. 3B). The down-regulation of activation and differentiation markers in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes of CD11chi DC-ablated mice was also confirmed using recipient mice reconstituted by BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR mice, in order to assure the residual effect of DT (Fig. S6). Additionally, it was revealed that the expression levels of differentiation markers in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes and CD11b+Ly-6Ghi neutrophils of BM cells were not affected by the depletion of CD11chi DCs (Fig. S5B), which indicates that the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in the spleen and brain, but not BM, is affected by CD11chi DC ablation.",

As expected, a small fraction of splenic CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocyte expressing CD11c molecule was moderately reduced by DT injection (Fig. S7A). However, the frequency and number of CD11c-expressing CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes infiltrated into the CNS were not significantly altered by DT injection, due to higher CNS-infiltration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in CD11chi DC-ablated mice (Fig. S7B). Therefore, it was thought that CD11c-expressing monocytes might affect the expression of MHC II and costimulatory molecules in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes, due to highly dominant population of CD11c-negative Ly-6Chi monocytes. It is believed that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes develop in BM and arise from cMoP derived from MDP1314. Therefore, to further examine the impact of CD11chi DCs on the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes, we examined the frequency and number of monocyte progenitors, MDP and cMoP, in BM of CD11c-DTR mice during JE (Fig. S7C). CD11chi DC ablation provided slightly increased frequency, but not number, of MDP in BM before infection, while cMoP was accumulated in BM only during JE. Of note, CD11chi DC-ablated mice contained moderately decreased number of cMoP in BM compared to vehicle-treated mice, which implies that the differentiation process of MDP into cMoP could be affected by CD11chi DC ablation. To further characterize the regulation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocyte differentiation by CD11chi DCs, we next examined their morphologies (Fig. 3C). Based on morphological examinations of monocytes described by Goasguen et al.30, the morphology of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in DC-ablated mice come near to immature monocytes, compared to CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice. CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in DC-ablated mice showed a monotonous shape for the cell membrane and a round/oval nuclear shape, whereas CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed irregular shape of cell membrane and lobulated/indented nuclear shape which is the typical morphology of a mature monocyte and/or macrophage-like morphology. This immature morphology for the CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in DC-ablated mice was also supported by FSC and SSC results of flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results suggest that CD11chi DCs play a certain role in regulating the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes during JE, thereby affecting the outcome of JE progression.",

There was no significant difference in viral burdens of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes derived from CD11c-DTR mice that CD11chi DCs were depleted or not. However, infiltrated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in the CNS of DC-ablated mice showed higher expression of some inflammatory cytokines than those of CD11c-DTR mice in which CD11chi DCs were not depleted. Notably, the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and CCL2, which showed prominent increases in the CNS during JE progression, were significantly increased in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes infiltrated into the immune-privileged CNS of DC-ablated mice, compared to those of vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 3D). Also, in general, CD11chi DC number was gradually restored within 3\u20134 days after stopping injection of DT (Fig. 4A). Thus, we were interested in whether the restoration of CD11chi DCs after stopping DT injection could induce the phenotypic recovery of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4B). After stopping DT injection, the expression levels of differentiation markers in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes were gradually recovered until reaching the levels found in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, depending on restoration of CD11chi DCs. Of note, the phenotypic recovery of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes was faster if CD11c-DTR mice were infected with JEV. Furthermore, to confirm the phenotypic recovery of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes by CD11chi DC restoration, we tested if down-regulated phenotype of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in CD11chi DC-ablated mice could be recovered by injection of sorted CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs during JE (Fig. 4C,D). As expected, our results revealed that the injection of sorted CD11chi DCs provided the recovered phenotypes of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in the spleen and CNS of DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice. Ultimately, these results suggest that CD11chi DCs play a role in maintaining phenotypic homeostasis of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes, and thereby affect neuroinflammation after their infiltration in the immune-privileged CNS.",

            "text": "A previous study showed that mice with conditional DC depletion develop myeloproliferative disorder (MDP), as indicated by a massive increase in CD11b+ cell number with elevated serum levels of Flt3-L31. In the current study, we also found elevated Flt3-L levels in sera and spleen of CD11chi DC-depleted mice, while changes in GM-CSF, CCL2, and CXCL1 were not observed (Fig. 5A,B). However, such levels of Flt3-L in serum and spleen were dramatically enhanced in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice following JEV infection, rather than in CD11chi DC-depleted mice. Interestingly, however, the GM-CSF level in serum, but not the spleen, was significantly enhanced in CD11chi DC-depleted mice following JEV infection. Because inadequate differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in DC-ablated mice was more apparent after JEV infection along with alteration of Flt3-L and GM-CSF production and the proliferation and phenotypes of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes were not significantly altered by incubation with sera derived from uninfected CD11c-DTR mice that received DT injection (Fig. S8), we were focused on the roles of serum Flt3-L and GM-CSF in modulating the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes using sera obtained from JEV-infected CD11c-DTR mice that were previously treated with vehicle or DT. Our results revealed that moderately elevated proliferation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes was achieved by incubating the splenocytes of DC-ablated mice with sera of vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 5C), while decreased expression of surface markers CD40, CD62L, and MHC class II in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes was observed in sera obtained from CD11chi DC-depleted mice (Fig. 5D). In addition, in order to examine whether Flt3-L and GM-CSF were involved in such down-regulation of CD40, CD62L, and MHC class II, the splenocytes of CD11chi DC-depleted mice were incubated with sera in the presence of neutralizing Abs against Flt3-L and GM-CSF. The neutralization of Flt3-L and/or GM-CSF induced significantly recovered expression levels of CD40, CD62L, and MHC class II in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes incubated with sera derived from CD11chi DC-depleted mice (Fig. 5E). This finding indicates that Flt3-L and GM-CSF could modulate the down-regulation of differentiation markers in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes derived from CD11chi DC-depleted mice. Also, we examined the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes incubated with sera derived from JEV-infected CD11c-DTR mice that received vehicle or DT. CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes incubated with sera of CD11chi DC-depleted mice showed higher expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, CCL2, and CXCL2, compared to monocytes incubated with sera of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5F). Such increased expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes incubated with sera of DC-ablated mice were significantly reduced by blocking GM-CSF, whereas lower expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes incubated with sera of vehicle-treated mice were reversed or moderately enhanced with treatment of anti-Flt3-L neutralizing antibody. Of note, CCL2 expression in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes incubated with sera of vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice was significantly enhanced by blocking Flt3-L and/or GM-CSF. Collectively, these results imply that down-regulation of differentiation markers and enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes derived from DC-ablated mice could be mediated by Flt3-L and GM-CSF with their differential trends following JEV infection.",

            "text": "It is still unclear whether infiltration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in immune-privileged CNS plays a deleterious or beneficial role in neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic viruses such as WNV56789101112. Although our results propose early pronounced CNS infiltration of inadequately differentiated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in the absence of CD11chi DCs, resulting in the induction of severe neuroinflammation and a deleterious role in encephalitis, we did not provide direct evidence as to whether infiltration of inadequately differentiated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes into the immune-privileged CNS played a deleterious or beneficial role in JE progression. To address this issue, we used recipient mice reconstituted by BM cells derived from CCR2 KO mice that are monocytopenic, in which tissue recruitment of monocytes is impaired in infectious disease models9. CCR2 KO BM recipients were infected with JEV after adoptive transfer of sorted CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes from DT- or vehicle-injected CD11c-DTR mice. Interestingly, CCR2 KO BM recipients that received CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes derived from DC-ablated mice were more susceptible to JE, as compared to CCR2 KO BM recipients given CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes sorted from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (p = 0.033) (Fig. 6A). There was also a moderate increase in susceptibility to JE in CCR2 KO BM recipients given CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes from vehicle-treated mice, compared to JEV-infected CCR2 KO BM recipients given no monocytes. Furthermore, CCR2 KO BM recipients that received CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes sorted from CD11chi DC-depleted mice showed faster development of neurological disorders after JEV infection than did recipients of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes from vehicle-treated mice. We also used recipient mice reconstituted by BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR\u00b7CCR2 KO mice to exclude the recovery potential of inadequately differentiated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes by endogenous CD11chi DCs (Fig. S9). The recipients of BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR\u00b7CCR2 KO mice were infected with JEV following the adoptive transfer of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes sorted from CD11c-DTR mice that received DT or vehicle. CD11c-DTR\u00b7CCR2 KO BM recipients were injected with DT to inhibit the recovery potential of adoptively transferred CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes by endogenous CD11chi DCs. Similar to the experiment using CCR2 KO BM recipients, CD11c-DTR\u00b7CCR2 KO BM recipients that received CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes sorted from CD11chi DC-ablated mice showed higher susceptibility to JE than did the recipients of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes sorted from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, as evaluated by mortality (p = 0.0349) (Fig. S9A), rapid development of neurological disorder (Fig. S9B), and body weight change during JE progression (Fig. S9C). Therefore, these results provide direct evident that inadequately differentiated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes generated in CD11chi DC-ablated mice are more deleterious to neuroinflammation than those of vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, thereby providing exacerbated JE.",

However, interestingly, CCR2 KO BM recipients given sorted CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes from CD11chi DC-depleted mice had significantly increased levels of viral burden in the immune-privileged CNS tissues, compared to CCR2 KO BM recipients that received CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes sorted from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice or just JEV-infected CCR2 KO BM recipients. Also, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2 and CXCL2) were closely associated with the levels of viral burden in the spleen and the CNS (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these results indicate that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes derived from DC-ablated mice exacerbate neuroinflammation in immune-privileged CNS during JE progression by supplying enhanced viral burden and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Generally, a skewed distribution favoring CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes (DTCMTMR) derived from CD11chi DC-depleted mice was observed in lymphoid (spleen and BM) and inflammatory tissue (brain) (Fig. 6E). Notably, donor DTCMTMR cells displayed a more dramatically skewed distribution in blood and inflamed CNS, compared to lymphoid tissues such as spleen and BM. In agreement with this finding, the ratios of absolute numbers of DTCMTMR to VehCMFDA were greater in blood and CNS (~4:1) than those of spleen and BM (~2:1) (Fig. 6F). Taken together, these results indicate that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes differentiated in the absence of CD11chi DCs migrate to the immune-privileged CNS with a skewed distribution to induce severe neuroinflammatory reaction in a CCR2-dependent manner.",

Because the role of CD11chi DCs in initiating Ag-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses have been well defined, it is expected that CD11chi DC-ablated mice could develop decreased humoral and T cell responses specific for JEV Ag. Although CD11c-DTR mice infected with JEV usually exhibited neurological disorder at 3\u20134 dpi before fully functional adaptive immune responses are induced, we examined JEV-specific humoral and T-cell responses using survived mice at 7 dpi. As expected, decreased levels of JEV E protein-specific IgM were observed in sera of CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DC-depleted mice (Fig. 7A). Similarly, DC-ablated mice showed decreased percentages and absolute number of JEV-specific CD4+ T cells, as evaluated by intracellular CD154 staining upon stimulation with two epitope peptides of CD4+ T cells (Fig. 7B,C). Furthermore, diminished percentage and absolute number of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells in response to stimulation with JEV CD8+ T cell epitope peptide were observed in CD11chi DC-depleted mice (Fig. 7D,E). Since CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells may contribute to control neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic virus32, we also addressed the frequency and number of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells in the spleen and brain of survived mice 5 dpi. CD11chi DC-depleted mice exhibited decreased frequency and absolute number of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells in the spleen and brain (Fig. 7F,G), which indicates that decreased CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells could contribute to exacerbation of JE in CD11chi DC-depleted mice. Therefore, these results suggest that decreased JEV-specific humoral and T-cell responses and CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells provide failure to control severe neuroinflammation in DC-ablated mice, thereby more exacerbating JE at later phase.",

Moreover, in consistent with previous reports2021, DCs in the CNS were not affected by DT injection (data not shown). Thus, to determine whether CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DC-depletion facilitated the direct spreading of virus within the CNS, we directly evaluated JEV replication in several different sub-tissues of the CNS (cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, brain stem, and spinal cord) 2 and 4 days after direct intracranial infection. The viral burden in several different sub-tissues of brain was not changed by the depletion of CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs at 2 and 4 days after intracranial infection (Fig. 8A), which indicates that the depletion of peripheral CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs does not affect direct CNS dissemination of the virus. This implies that the amount of delivered virus from the periphery may contribute to the enhancement of viral burden in the CNS of DC-ablated mice. Also, CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DC-depleted mice showed no significant change in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs in several different sub-tissues of brain intracranially infected with JEV, compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 8B). Furthermore, the infiltration levels of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes and CD11b+Ly-6Ghi neutrophils after intracranial infection of JEV were comparable in both vehicle- and DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 8C). Collectively, these results indicate that the peripheral depletion of CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs exerts no influence on neuronal dissemination of virus inoculated within the CNS.",

More interestingly, CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes were found to have a deleterious rather than protective role during JE progression, and CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes generated in CD11chi DC-ablated environment showed altered differentiation levels and exacerbated the progression of neuroinflammation via their faster and increased recruitment and subsequently enhanced supply of virus into inflamed CNS in a CCR2-dependent manner. Furthermore, Flt3-L and GM-CSF played a role in controlling the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi inflammatory monocytes in the absence of CD11chi DCs.

However, their role in CNS inflammation caused by a neurotropic virus such as WNV has not been clearly delineated due to conflicting results9101112. One clear finding in the present study was that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes have a deleterious role and exacerbate CNS inflammation, as proven by the enhanced severity of CNS inflammation when sorted CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes were injected into CCR2 KO BM recipients. Notably, considering that inadequately differentiated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes developed in CD11chi DC-ablated environment caused more significantly augmented severity of neuroinflammation, the differentiation levels of infiltrated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in the CNS reflect to be one of important factors for regulating the progression of lethal neuroinflammation. This finding is strengthened by the recent result that peripheral DCs play an important role in functionally priming Ly-6Chi monocytes to promote its tissue-specific function during inflammation33. However, it is still unclear how CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes infiltrated in immune-privileged CNS of CD11chi DC-depleted mice exacerbated neuroinflammation. One evidence to explain this question was that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes developed in CD11chi DC-depleted mice could provide exacerbated neuroinflammation through higher expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and CCL2 than those of vehicle-treated mice, since TNF-\u03b1 and CCL2 have been known to induce neuronal apoptosis, increase BBB permeability, and amplify infiltration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes3435. Also, DCs derived from blood CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes showed distinct characteristics allowing them to induce neuroinflammation in the CNS, compared to DCs that resided in the CNS36. These additional pieces of evidence support our results. However, the higher expression of TNF-\u03b1 and CCL2 in inadequately differentiated Ly-6Chi monocytes during JE provides a bit opposite result that remains to be defined in future study. In addition, there was another incongruous finding regarding JEV RNA burden in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes derived from CD11chi DC-depleted mice. Our results revealed that infiltrated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in the brains of vehicle- and DT-treated mice were comparable in viral RNA burden, which indicates that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in both environments have a similar ability to deliver virus into the CNS. We also found that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes sorted from vehicle- and DT-treated mice showed no difference in permissiveness to in vitro viral infection (data not shown). One explanation to this incongruous finding is that increased number of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in DC-ablated mice might be able to supply virus much more readily than those of CD11c-DTR mice in which CD11chi DCs were not depleted.",

            "text": "Intriguing finding in this study was that CD11chi DCs regulate the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes. This regulation of Ly-6Chi monocytes by DCs may be explained by mutually nonexclusive scenarios of increased Flt3-L and GM-CSF, because altered phenotype of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes is closely associated with elevated levels of Flt3-L and GM-CSF in the presence and absence, respectively, of CD11chi DCs following viral infection. First, since GM-CSF has been known to be an important factor in the control of CD11chi cDC development and maintenance at the periphery37, the ablation of CD11chi cDCs serving as a major \u201cligand sink\u201d could provide elevated levels of GM-CSF in JEV-infected mice, due to decreased consumption of factors. Thus, elevated GM-CSF in DC-ablated mice is likely to provide immature monocytes during neuroinflammation progression. Alternatively, CD11chi DCs may also provide secreted or membrane-bound signals that regulate Flt3-L production by stromal cells or lymphocytes38. Considering that Flt3-L plays an important role in the development of CD11cintPDCA-1hi pDCs as well as monocytes39, the elevated level of Flt3-L in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice following JEV infection may stimulate the development of CD11cintPDCA-1hi pDCs, as well as maturation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes. Indeed, our results provided several clues to these possibilities; the increased number of CD11cintPDCA-1hi pDCs after JEV infection along with elevated level of Flt3-L as well as the differential regulation of differentiation markers and CCL2 chemokine expression in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes by neutralization of Flt3-L and GM-CSF. In the absence of such a CD11chi DC-mediated feedback loop, altered levels of Flt3-L and GM-CSF would ultimately result in a changed phenotype and function of peripheral CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes during JE progression. Furthermore, our data is supported by the report that GM-CSF can block Flt3-L-driven development of pDC by activating STAT5 that binds to IRF8 promoter4041. Therefore, inadequate maturation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in selective ablation of CD11chi DCs is unlikely to result from a direct interplay between DCs and monocytes, but, instead, be related to imbalanced consumption of hematopoietic factors in DC-ablated model. Also, CD11chi DC ablation is likely to induce dysregulation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocyte differentiation under steady state, because moderate alteration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocyte differentiation has been already achieved in the spleen of DC-ablated mice before viral infection. It is thought that this inadequately differentiated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in DC-ablated mice are rapidly deployed into the inflamed CNS following JEV infection42. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanism linking CD11chi DC loss to altered differentiation and function of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes may provide critical clues to understanding the differentiation lineage of DCs and monocytes.",

The spleen has also been identified as an important reservoir of monocytes that are rapidly deployed to sites of inflammation, including the ischemic heart and brain42. Whether the spleen is a significant source of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes during CNS inflammation caused by neurotropic viruses such as JEV and WNV is yet to be determined, but both spleen and BM are considered to be critical for supplying CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes to the inflamed CNS, particularly in cases of acute and severe infection, in which large numbers of these cells are rapidly deployed and recruited to the brain42. Here, an exceptional result was that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in BM showed no altered phenotypic levels by depletion of CD11chi DCs. This finding indicates that, due to the spatial effect of colocalization in the marginal zone43, CD11chi DCs in the spleen may regulate the differentiation and function of splenic CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes, which are subsequently mobilized into the CNS by viral infection. This notion is contrast with the recent results showing that the function of Ly-6Chi monocytes is pre-emptively educated in BM prior to the arrival of monocytes at local inflammation site33. It is thought that this contrast result may be derived from different context of infection model and/or depletion methods. The CCL2/CCR2 axis is a very important player in the context of viral encephalitis, facilitating emigration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes from BM into blood and entry into immune-privileged CNS59. The major producer of CCL2 appears to be different in the CNS, depending on pathogens, with microglia serving as an important source during HSV infection44, neurons in the case of WNV5, and astrocytes in HIV encephalitis45. Our results support the possibility that infiltrated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes may be one of several producers to recruit CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes themselves. No matter the source of CCL2, disruption of the CCL2/CCR2 axis can significantly reduce the infiltration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes into the brain9. Thus, another interesting finding was that CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes generated in CD11chi DC-ablated environment showed faster and more skewed migration into inflamed CNS and blood. This altered migration of monocytes generated in DC-ablated mice can be explained by moderately enhanced expression of CCR2 molecules in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes infiltrated in brain. Similar to a previous report9, we found that CCR2 was not involved in the migration of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes from blood into the inflamed CNS because the same ratio of labeled CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes from vehicle- and DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice was observed in both blood and CNS. Although CCR2 molecule is most important in CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocyte trafficking in the brain, additional work will be needed to define whether there is also a reduction in T cell subsets and other leukocytes at a later stage.",

            "text": "However, interpretation of the data generated in this study requires caution because DCs are important player to initiate adaptive immunity against pathogens. Impaired adaptive immunity developed in the absence of DCs might be able to promote JE progression. Indeed, survived CD11chi DC-depleted mice at 7 dpi generated diminished humoral and T-cell responses specific for JEV antigen. Because CD11c-DTR mice infected with JEV usually exhibited neurological disorder at 3\u20134 dpi before fully functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are induced, rapid innate cell responses such as CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes appear more critical to control JE progression at the early stage. In contrast, impaired humoral and T cell responses generated in the absence of CD11chiPDCA-1int/lo DCs are likely to be involved in the exacerbation of JE progression at later stage started from around 5 dpi. Furthermore, the role of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in acute viral diseases is still debatable32. Recent work implicates CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in the control of neuroinflammation caused by WNV32, wherein peripheral expansion of Treg was associated with mild inflammation, but reduced Treg levels were associated with WNV encephalitis. Thus, the reduction of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells in DC-ablated mice appears failed to control neuroinflammation. Also, DC ablation triggers a progressive myeloproliferative disorder in situations of constitutive DC ablation using cell-type specific expression of a suicide gene31. Moreover, the proliferative responses of HSCs in DC-deficient mice have been observed in several pathologic diseases such as sepsis, which induces a transient reduction of the DC population46. Similarly, a transient reduction of DC subsets was also observed in JEV infection47, which could alter hematopoietic cell responses. Here, CD11chi DC-depleted mice did not show any apparent increases in numbers of myeloid-derived cells in the spleen before viral infection, except for a moderate increase in frequency of CD11b+Ly-6Chi cells. However, DC-ablated mice induced significantly increased frequency and absolute number of splenic CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes during JE progression (data not shown). This observation describes a critical role for CD11chi DCs in the feedback regulation of steady- as well as pathologic-state hematopoiesis, which may be mediated by growth factors such as Flt3-L and GM-CSF in the absence of DCs. Therefore, our current findings suggest that peripheral CD11chi DCs play a critical and unexpected role in preserving the immune-privileged CNS via regulating the differentiation, function, and trafficking of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes derived by hematopoietic stem cells.",

On the basis of tight interactions of DCs in the monocyte-phagocyte differentiation system, it is presumable that selective depletion of specific DC subsets changes the features of monocyte subpopulations and that DCs contribute to the maintenance of a disciplined monocytic system to preserve the immune-privileged CNS. Although the precise molecular mechanisms and specific subpopulations of CD11chi DCs involved in their control of monocyte differentiation to foster immune privilege of the CNS remains to be defined, our results provide new insight to a critical and unrecognized role of peripheral CD11chi DCs in the control of CNS inflammation through regulating the differentiation, function, and trafficking of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes.",

A total of 5.0 \u00d7 106 CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes (2 doses, each 2.5 \u00d7 106 cells) were injected intravenously into JEV-infected CCR2 KO mice at 4 dpi. Brain, BM, and spleen tissues as well as blood were harvested 20 h after injection of donor cells and the infiltrated cells were analyzed for the presence of labeled cells by FACS. To analyze brain leukocytes, vigorous heart perfusion was performed before harvesting brain tissue. Cell distribution of labeled donor cells was calculated based on the ratio detected in the output organ (CNS, blood, BM, and spleen) compared with the initial input ratio of labeled cells at the time of cell transfer (DTCMTMR:VehCMFDA).",
