Inhibitory signaling dampens the immune response, which prevents inflammatory damage to the host. It has now become increasingly clear that viruses have evolved means of exploiting the inhibitory signaling pathways of the immune system in order to blunt the responses that would otherwise abrogate infection. Recent evidence demonstrates how viruses exploit inhibitory receptors both for host cell entry and to down-regulate antiviral responses for enhanced viral pathogenesis. Both acute and chronic viral infections also induce expression of intermediates of inhibitory signaling for improved odds of survival within the intracellular environment. This review highlights and synthesizes from recent findings how medically important viruses exploit the inhibitory pathways that maintain immune homeostasis for successful human infection.",

Paired receptors consisting of activating and inhibitory receptors recognize self and non-self ligands. They are essential for maintaining self-tolerance, mounting an immune response during infection, and modulating the intensity of the response to prevent autoimmunity and inflammatory damage to bystander cells [1]. Activating receptors recruit adaptor molecules containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) or bear ITAMs in their cytoplasmic tails for signaling. Upon ligation and clustering of activating receptors, ITAMs are phosphorylated by Src family kinases, which create docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2)-domain containing kinases like spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and zeta chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) [1]. These kinases phosphorylate downstream substrates and form receptor-proximal signaling complexes that drive phagocytosis, cellular activation, and pro-inflammatory responses. To achieve immune homeostasis, inhibitory receptors containing one or several immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic tail are employed [2]. Ligation of inhibitory receptors leads to Src family kinase-mediated ITIM phosphorylation and recruitment of SH2-domain containing cytoplasmic phosphatases like SH2-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), SHP-2, and SH2-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1) [2]. Dephosphorylation of downstream signaling effector molecules results in down-regulation of immune responses and maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance.",

            "text": "Although activating and inhibitory signals are integrated for immune homeostasis, they might not contribute proportionately to signaling output due to dominant inhibitory signaling, as exemplified by natural killer (NK) cell responses [3]. NK cells are innate lymphocytes that have a role in early control of infection and tumorigenesis, and recent studies have provided insight on how paired receptor signaling facilitates NK cell effector functions. Binding of viral proteins or cellular stress-induced proteins to activating receptors on NK cells triggers the release of cytolytic granules to eliminate infected or transformed cells [3]. Conversely, inhibitory receptors on NK cells bind major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, which induces self-tolerance and protects bystander cells against inflammatory damage. Paradoxically, inhibitory signaling also maintains NK cell responsiveness, as NK cells devoid of inhibitory receptors are hyporesponsive [4]. Interaction of inhibitory receptors with MHC-I molecules increases NK cell responsiveness through a dynamic process known as \u201clicensing,\u201d which in turn sensitizes NK cells to signaling from activating receptors. Evidently, signaling from paired receptors is not always integrated in a simple balance and thus serves as a caveat when interpreting the functional outcome of receptor engagement by pathogen-derived ligands or signaling intermediates.",

Viruses are known to utilize inhibitory receptors for host cell entry, which also initiate inhibitory signaling to down-regulate antiviral responses for enhanced viral replication. The recent use of quantitative temporal viromics, which profiles proteomic changes in viral and host cell proteins over time, has demonstrated how viruses also dramatically alter the expression of cell surface proteins to counter the host cell\u2019s defenses [5]. Finally, viruses that cause chronic diseases in humans utilize inhibitory signaling to impose T cell exhaustion, which greatly hampers response to disease treatment.

It binds cell surface phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which are exposed following increased levels of intracellular calcium during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [6]. Interaction between CD300a and its ligands results in SHP-1 recruitment for suppression of NK cell-mediated cytolysis in tumor cells [7] and inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI-mediated mast cell activation [6]. CD300a also serves as an attachment factor for dengue virus (DENV) and enhances DENV infection in primary macrophages [8]. It is likely that CD300a recognizes PE on the virion surface, possibly acquired when DENV buds from the endoplasmic reticulum during replication. Because CD300a has been shown to inhibit toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent inflammatory pathways [9], ligation of CD300a by DENV could inhibit or delay innate immune response against infection.",

Binding of LILRB1 to its natural ligand, major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) molecules, leads to recruitment of SHP-1 and potentiates negative feedback mechanisms such as inhibition of B cell receptor signaling and inhibition of cell killing by NK and T cells [11]. During antibody-enhanced DENV infection, non- or sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies form immune complexes with DENV, which are taken up via activating Fc\u03b3Rs on myeloid cells [12]. This phenomenon, also known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), is postulated to explain the heightened risk of severe dengue following secondary infection. Ligation of activating Fc\u03b3Rs by antibody-opsonized DENV leads to Syk and STAT-1 phosphorylation, activating transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), known to inhibit viral replication [13]. Unlike its interaction with CD300a, co-ligation of LILRB1 does not alter the rate of viral entry. Instead, co-ligation of LILRB1 by DENV resulted in SHP-1 recruitment, dephosphorylation of Syk, and down-regulation of ISGs, which permits successful viral replication during ADE (Fig 1A) [10].",

Interestingly, both the MeV vaccine strain and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) binds CD46, which protects infected cells from complement attack [21,22]. It also inhibits IL-12 production by macrophages, suppressing NK cell and T cell activity [21,22]. Likewise, ligation of CD46 by recombinant adenovirus (rAdV) type-35 vectors also blocked IL-2 production and CD4+ T cell activation [23]. An important consideration in the use of rAdV for vaccine or gene delivery would thus involve ablation of binding to CD46 for inducing transgene-specific immunity. Evidently, the immunomodulatory role of CD46 and its ability to bridge the innate and adaptive immune response explain why it is such an attractive target for multiple viruses.",

PD-1 and PD-L1 are up-regulated in monocytes and macrophages upon HIV-1 infection, inducing high levels of IL-10 that impair CD4+ T cell activation (Fig 1D) [41,42]. PD-L1high infected cells also escaped from cytotoxic T cell killing and accumulated over the course of HIV-1 infection [43].

Likewise, acute neurological infections with rabies [48] or coronavirus [49] also produce similar effects. These infections are driven by increased PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells, rapidly inducing a transcriptional state synonymous with T cell exhaustion (Fig 1D). Antigen-dependent up-regulation of other inhibitory receptors such as TIM-3, lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), and 2B4 was also observed with HMPV infection [46]. These inhibitory receptors thus contribute to T cell exhaustion during acute viral infections by working in concert with PD-1 signaling.",

Given that members of a virus family share many conserved structural and non-structural proteins, it is plausible that viral strategies to manipulate inhibitory signaling could be relevant to a broader range of viruses than those discussed here. Understanding how viruses exploit inhibitory signaling could lead to rationally designed interventions that interrupt these critical virus\u2013host interactions. The potential of an anti-PD-L1 antibody in reducing viral reservoirs in HIV-1 patients was recently evaluated in a clinical trial (NCT02028403). We anticipate that a combination of therapies targeting critical steps of the viral life cycle and boosting different arms of the immune response could provide recourse for both acute and persistent viral infections.",

By co-ligating inhibitory receptor LILRB1, antibody-opsonized DENV blocks Fc\u03b3R-mediated up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to enhance viral replication. B. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) expresses UL18, an MHC class I homologue, which triggers LILRB1-mediated inhibitory signaling to limit antiviral effector functions and NK cell lysis. Peptide derived from UL40 also increases HLA-E expression, and the increased interaction between HLA-E and CD94/NKG2A inhibits NK cell lysis. C. HCMV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) produce peptides that stabilize the expression of HLA-E and HLA-A. This increases interaction with inhibitory receptors like CD94/NKG2A and KIR3DL2 to inhibit NK cell activation. D. Expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3, as well as the PD-1 ligand. PD-L1 is up-regulated during chronic and acute viral infections. PD-1 and TIM-3 inhibitory signaling results in impaired T cell activation and T cell exhaustion, leading to viral persistence in chronic infections.",
