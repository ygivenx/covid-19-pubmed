For viruses that bind to sialic acid, a receptor that is abundant both on the surface of cells and in the secreted extracellular mucosal environment, attachment and detachment is controlled by receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities on the viral surface (Rosenthal et al., 1998; Zeng et al., 2008). Influenza A viruses (IAVs), respiratory pathogens that contribute to seasonal flu and have pandemic potential, achieve this balance with hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated receptor binding and neuraminidase (NA)-catalyzed receptor destruction (Air and Laver, 1989; Skehel and Wiley, 2000). Although the importance and genetic basis of the functional balance between HA and NA in IAV has been thoroughly characterized (Wagner et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2012; Yen et al., 2011), it is becoming clear that transmissibility of influenza viruses within and between hosts depends on factors beyond the sequence of these two genes (Chou et al., 2011; Herfst et al., 2012; Neumann and Kawaoka, 2015).",

To infect the underlying epithelium, viral particles must first pass through a ~ 1\u201310 \u03bcm thick layer of mucus that is being steadily transported towards the pharynx where it can be swallowed, neutralizing any virus immobilized within it (Bustamante-Marin and Ostrowski, 2017; Wanner et al., 1996; Zanin et al., 2016). Viruses that bind too tightly to sialic acid will pass through the mucus barrier very slowly, and will thus be unable to reach the surface of an airway epithelial cell before mucociliary clearance. In contrast, viruses that bind only very weakly to sialic acid (or which rapidly destroy it through excessive NA activity [Cohen et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014]) will quickly penetrate mucus, but may be unable to stably attach to the surface of the underlying epithelium once it is reached. Adaptations that help the virus to overcome both of these conflicting challenges, such as changes in virus morphology or a particular spatial organization of envelope proteins, could be evolutionarily favored during in vivo replication.",

While clinical isolates of IAV \u2013 samples adapted to transmission in a mucosal environment \u2013 form filamentous particles with a consistent diameter but widely varying length, laboratory-adapted strains tend to produce more uniform, spherical particles (Badham and Rossman, 2016; Chu, 1949; Dadonaite et al., 2016; Seladi-Schulman et al., 2013). Recent evidence from the 2009 pandemic suggests that filamentous morphology, conferred by the virus\u2019s M segment, may play a role in transmission (Campbell et al., 2014; Lakdawala et al., 2011). However, whether or not virus morphology contributes directly to virus transmission \u2013 and if so, how \u2013 remains unclear. Similarly, although the two major envelope proteins of IAV, HA and NA, have been observed by electron microscopy to cluster non-uniformly on both the viral and pre-viral envelope (Calder et al., 2010; Harris et al., 2006; Leser and Lamb, 2017), whether and how the spatial organization of HA and NA affects virus transmission also remains unclear.",

To test this idea, we sought to characterize the organization of proteins in filamentous IAV particles while simultaneously observing their engagement with sialic acid \u2013 a measurement that requires a non-destructive approach. To make this measurement possible, we recently developed strains of influenza A virus that are amenable to fluorescence microscopy through site-specific tags introduced into the viral genome (Vahey and Fletcher, 2019). Here we show that filamentous particles frequently contain asymmetric distributions of HA and NA in their membranes, and that this distinctive organization biases the diffusion of these particles in a persistent direction over distances of several microns. By enhancing the effective diffusion of a viral particle without reducing the stability of its attachment to the viral receptor, this mechanism could promote virus penetration across mucosal barriers.",

            "text": "We first sought to characterize the organization and dynamics of proteins in the viral membrane. By labeling HA and NA, along with the viral nucleoprotein, NP, we are able to measure features of virus organization on intact, infectious particles that corroborate and extend previous observations made using electron microscopy (Calder et al., 2010; Chlanda et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2006; Leser and Lamb, 2017). For these experiments, we use a tagged variant of the strain A/WSN/1933 with M1 from A/Udorn/1972, which differs from WSN M1 at six residues and confers filamentous morphology (Elleman and Barclay, 2004). Consistent with our prior observations, this virus produces filamentous particles that vary widely in size, from sub-diffraction limited spots to particles > 10 \u03bcm in length (Vahey and Fletcher, 2019). In viruses with fluorescently-labeled HA and NA, we observe a pronounced tendency for NA to be enriched at one end of the virus (Figure 1A, inset). To quantify this enrichment, we measured the relative intensities of HA and NA within ~400 nm of each viral pole in filamentous particles > 1 \u00b5m in length. Across 20344 such particles, approximately one third have NA intensities at least 5-fold higher on one pole than on the other (Figure 1A, left). Similarly, viruses with labeled NP (the most abundant protein in vRNP complexes and a proxy for the virus genome) reveal individual foci that localize to one end of the virus. Aligning filamentous particles with polarized NP foci (4805 in total) reveals a tendency for NA to colocalize with NP (Figure 1A, right). For the subset of these particles > 4.5 \u00b5m in length (540 in total), we created a composite image showing the average densities of viral proteins within 2 \u00b5m of each viral pole (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). On average, NA is enriched ~2 x relative to HA at the NP-containing pole in these particles, as compared to the middle region of the particle and the opposite pole (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1, bottom), suggesting that NA localization is linked (directly or indirectly) to the location of the viral genome. This protein distribution is stable, since photobleached portions of unfixed filamentous particles do not recover fluorescence in either HA or NA over tens of minutes (Figure 1B).",

At this resolution, we find that the tendency of NA to concentrate at one of the viral poles is pronounced even in particles smaller than 300 nm in length (Figure 1C). We also find that the NA seen at low levels along the length of filamentous viruses without super-resolution imaging is actually organized into small NA clusters (Figure 1D). Additionally, HA and NA distributions in these particles are modestly anti-correlated (Figure 1E), suggesting that receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities may be spatially segregated on some regions of the virus. Collectively, these measurements present a picture of a variegated IAV envelope whose spatial organization is stable and coupled to the presence and location of the viral genome, with ~70% of NP-containing viruses having NA biased to the proximal pole.",

As a first test of this idea, we compared the spatial organization of viruses that were released from the cell surface with those that remained attached after challenging the virus with the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) oseltamivir carboxylate (He et al., 1999) (Materials and methods). To quantify virus spatial organization, we defined HA-NA polarity as the separation between the center of masses for HA and NA divided by the virus length. Interestingly, viruses that escaped the cell surface under NAI challenge showed higher HA-NA polarity (0.155; 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.139\u20130.171) than viruses released in the absence of NAI challenge, both before (0.123; 95% CI = 0.106\u20130.140) and after (0.100; 95% CI = 0.090\u20130.110) facilitating virus release by treating with exogenous sialidase (Figure 1F & G). In comparison, viruses treated with both NAI and exogenous sialidase have polarities similar to the untreated virus (0.124; 95% CI = 0.111\u20130.136). These results suggest that viruses with NA concentrated at one of the viral poles may be more effective at navigating environments rich in sialic acid.",

Because our approach to fluorescently labeling NA preserves its activity (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1) and viruses harboring fluorophores on both HA and NA preserve ~85% of their infectivity (Vahey and Fletcher, 2019), we could carry out functional assays with the virus and at the same time visualize HA and NA distributions on the viral membrane. Surprisingly, the motion we observed did not resemble randomly-oriented diffusion of the viral particle, but rather persistent, Brownian ratchet-like diffusion, in which filamentous particles with polarized distributions of NA exhibited directed mobility away from their NA-rich pole (Figure 2B, Video 1). Labeling coverslips with fluorescein-labeled Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL), which binds specifically to the terminal galactose exposed following sialic acid cleavage (Iglesias et al., 1982), revealed the history of virus trajectories and confirmed that virus motion is accompanied by receptor destruction (Figure 2B). Aligning the trajectories of mobile particles (defined as those with diffusion coefficients > 100 nm2/s, comprising ~68% of the population; Figure 2C) to the orientation of their HA-NA axis reveals that directional mobility can persist for several microns, many times the length of the particle itself (Figure 2D). Consistent with the observation that polarized distributions of HA and NA serve as a determinant for persistent motion and enhanced diffusion, we find that non-mobile viruses have, on average, less polarized distributions of HA and NA than mobile ones (Figure 2E).",

Although NA expression on the surface of infected cells is comparable to that seen for wildtype virus, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail reduces packaging of NA into virions (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B & C). Additionally, although NA\u0394CT virus imaged at ~30 nm resolution using STORM still exhibits NA clusters resembling those found in wildtype virus, the clusters are no longer immobilized on the surface of the virus, as revealed by photobleaching experiments (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A & B). Although both wildtype and NA\u0394CT viruses form filamentous particles (with wildtype virus producing a higher proportion of extremely large filaments >3 \u03bcm in length; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C), the polarity of NA distributions on the viral surface is significantly decreased in the NA\u0394CT strain relative to wildtype (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D). Using the same sialic acid coated surfaces, NA\u0394CT viruses no longer exhibited persistent directional motion (Figure 3A), indicating that spatial organization of NA at the poles is necessary for persistent mobility of IAV.",

To quantitatively compare the rate at which the less persistent NA\u0394CT viruses explore their environment to that of the more persistent wildtype virus, we determined mean squared displacements from observed trajectories of mobile viruses (diffusion coefficients > 100 nm2/s over the observation period) and simulated random walks in which the number of steps, the size of each step, and the time interval between steps all match the observed data, but the direction of each step is uncorrelated with previous steps (Figure 3B). From this analysis, we estimate that the diffusion coefficients of mobile viruses are enhanced approximately five-fold as a result of directional correlations (Figure 3B, left). In contrast, the diffusion of mobile NA\u0394CT viruses is only modestly influenced by directional correlations (~1.5 fold increase; Figure 3B, right). To further quantify the difference between viruses with wildtype NA and NA\u0394CT, we tracked the displacement of particles between subsequent frames acquired 30 s apart and plotted the distribution of the stepping angle relative to the orientation of the virus\u2019s HA-NA axis. Viruses with wildtype NA step in the direction of increasing HA (with the NA pole at the rear) roughly twice as frequently as the opposite direction, while NA\u0394CT viruses exhibit no correlation between orientation and stepping direction (Figure 3C). Additionally, despite having lower amounts of NA in the viral membrane, NA\u0394CT viruses left significantly larger trails of cleaved receptors than their wildtype counterparts (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3). These results demonstrate that the spatial organization and mobility of NA on the viral surface both play an important role in determining where and when it cleaves substrate.",

At the interface between HA-rich and NA-rich regions of the viral membrane, like those seen in fluorescence images (Figure 1A\u2013D), NA will periodically gain access to, and hydrolyze, sialic acid as the position of the virus thermally fluctuates. The binding partners available to HAs located close to this interface will therefore be asymmetrically distributed, with more potential binding partners located further away from areas of higher NA density. This concept is illustrated most clearly in the case where the virus is constrained to a one-dimensional path. As this case illustrates, the sialic acid density along the length of the virus is lowest in close proximity to NA (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5A\u2013C). When NA is confined to a single pole, this results in a gradient in sialic acid density along the length of the particle. Since the number of available binding partners is higher in one direction than another, newly-formed HA-sialic acid bonds will tend to be offset from previous bonds in this direction. This leads to the persistent motion we observe experimentally as well as in our simulations (Video 2). Consistent with this mechanism, persistent motion of the virus is lost when NA is no longer localized to a single virus pole and the sialic acid distribution beneath the particle becomes symmetric (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5B\u2013D). We note that virions with symmetric distributions of NA also occur in the virus population and would not be expected to exhibit persistent motion (for example, those particles with NA polar ratios of ~1 in Figure 1A).",

            "text": "Since virus motion is dependent on the virus\u2019s ability to establish distinct regions with and without sialic acid, we expect that dynamic distributions of either NA or sialic acid will alter virus mobility. Consistent with our experimental observations with the NA\u0394CT virus, allowing NA to freely diffuse eliminates directional bias in virus motion in both experiments (Figure 3C) and simulations (Figure 3D). However, allowing surface-bound sialic acid to diffuse can either enhance or suppress directed motion, depending on the kinetic parameters of HA and NA, the diffusion coefficient of sialic acid (DSA), and the size of the virus (Appendix). Although our experimental data corresponds to the case where sialic acid is immobilized (DSA ~0), our simulations predict that polarized IAV bound to slowly-diffusing transmembrane glycoproteins or gel-forming mucins (DSA <0.01 \u00b5m2/s) will exhibit enhanced directed mobility, likely due to the biased spatial distributions of sialic acid binding partners that are available to HAs distal to the virus\u2019s NA-rich pole. In contrast, increasing the rate of sialic acid diffusion further (DSA >0.01 \u00b5m2/s) is expected to suppress persistent motion, by flattening the sialic acid gradient that is created beneath the virus (Figure 3E, Video 3). Finally, we find that increasing the length of the virus in simulations increases the number of HA-sialic acid interactions, reducing virus mobility but increasing directional persistence (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6). Thus, the organization of proteins on the viral surface, the size of the virus, and the nature of the receptor to which the virus is bound can each influence the persistence of a virus\u2019s motion.",

To test this prediction, we cultured Calu-3 cells at an air-liquid interface, resulting in a ~ 1\u201310 \u00b5m thick gel of secreted mucus overlaying the apical surface of the cells (Figure 4A). Adding virus with labeled HA and NA to the mucus, followed by fixation and labeling with ECL, revealed tracks similar to those we observed on two-dimensional surfaces (Figure 4B). This suggests that the asymmetry of NA and HA biases the direction of virus diffusion in three dimensions, producing trails of cleaved sialic acid that can reach several microns in length as the virus moves (Figure 4C). This directional mobility is less prevalent in viruses with more uniformly distributed NA, though they nonetheless are capable of creating swaths of ECL-staining within the mucus that lack clear directionality (Figure 4D). Similar to our observations on idealized two-dimensional surfaces (Figure 3C), we find that viruses in mucus exhibit a slight tendency to align their HA-NA axis (captured at the moment of fixation) with the displacement of the virus relative to the center of ECL labeling (Figure 4E). These results suggest that the spatial organization of HA and NA on the virus surface may also promote penetration of polarized IAV particles through mucus barriers in vivo.",

This has revealed organizational features of filamentous IAV whose origins and functional significance remain unclear. By using site-specific fluorescent labeling to measure the organization of a virus while preserving its function, we are able to corroborate key observations of envelope protein non-uniformity obtained from electron microscopy and extend them to dynamic observations of both protein motion on the surface of the virus, as well as the directionally-persistent motion of influenza A virus particles as they engage with the virus receptor, sialic acid. These observations demonstrate that the morphology of a virus, the spatial organization of proteins in its membrane, and constraints on the diffusion of these proteins collectively confer the tendency for viral particles to exhibit persistent directional mobility, enhancing the virus\u2019s rate of diffusion without diminishing its strength of adhesion. Importantly, our simulations show that this feature of filamentous morphology would not be limited to the extremely large particles whose length is easily measured using diffraction limited microscopy, but rather extends to capsule-shaped particles < 200 nm in length (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6), which are known to be produced by filamentous strains of IAV (Calder et al., 2010). In contrast, this effect may be suppressed in spherical particles, due both to the absence of a clear axis for polarization and their ability to roll on two-dimensional surfaces. However, super-resolution live imaging will be required to confirm these predictions experimentally.",

            "text": "Although more work is needed to understand if these characteristics of IAV organization enhance infectivity and are adaptive during in vivo replication, a simple model of viral transport suggests how the directional viral mobility we observe could contribute during host-to-host transmission. On first entering the respiratory tract, viruses must diffuse through the mucosal barrier to infect the underlying airway epithelial cells. Competing with this process is mucocilliary clearance, which carries particles bound to mucus towards the pharynx where they are neutralized (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A). If the transport of a virus through a mucosal barrier is modeled as a first passage problem with a time limit imposed by the rate of mucociliary clearance, a five-fold increase in the diffusion coefficient (as predicted in Figure 3B) would lead to a proportional reduction in the first passage time. More dramatically, it would also increase the fraction of particles that reach the cell surface when the rate of mucociliary clearance is high and would normally prevent most particles from reaching the cell surface. Our experiments on two-dimensional sialic acid-coated surfaces suggest a diffusion coefficient of ~800 nm2/s for polarized viruses; adapting this value for a one-dimensional first passage model suggests that persistent motion increases the number of particles that reach the epithelium before being cleared by several orders of magnitude (Appendix, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B). Although there are multiple ways that a virus\u2019s passage through mucus can be accelerated (reducing its size, decreasing the number of HAs on its surface, increasing the number of NAs, or making the spatial distribution of NA more uniform), each of these changes would likely reduce binding stability once the virus has managed to reach the cell surface. In contrast, the polarized distributions of NA on the viral surface that we observe increase virus diffusion without compromising binding stability.",

Additionally, work characterizing the diffusion of influenza C virus, in which receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities are combined in a single protein (HEF), has shown that the destruction of receptors on a 2D surface prevents virions from retracing their steps (Sakai et al., 2018). Our results show that influenza A virus accomplishes a similar feat through a different mechanism \u2013 asymmetric distribution of receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities on the viral surface that results in persistent motion while maintaining stable attachment. The persistent directional mobility shown here orients filamentous virus motion parallel to its major axis, where it could further enhance the anomalous diffusion coefficients observed for cylindrical nanoparticles in mucus (Yu et al., 2016). Analogous to the combined importance of active motility and cell shape in mucosal bacteria (Bartlett et al., 2017; Sycuro et al., 2010), the directed mobility and cylindrical shape of IAV could help to explain the virus\u2019s ability to penetrate host mucus and contribute to the prevalence of filamentous morphology in clinical isolates of IAV.",

The plot to the left compares HA and NA intensities for 20344 filamentous particles of at least ~1 \u03bcm in length. Approximately one third of filamentous particles have NA intensities five-fold higher on one pole than the other, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines (distributions are symmetric in this case because poles are designated randomly). Inset images show a particle with NA enrichment of ~5.6 fold (~31st percentile of particles). The plot to the right shows the same comparison for particles aligned to their NP-foci, designated as pole 1 (distributions are determined from a total of 4805 particles with polarized NP distributions). The prevalence of particles with NA ratios > 1 indicates a tendency for NA to be enriched at the virus\u2019s genome-containing pole. Inset images show a particle with NA enrichment of ~3.3 fold (~48th percentile of particles based on NA polarity).

(E) Distribution of HA-NA spatial correlation coefficients from regions of 24 filamentous particles following reconstruction at ~30 nm resolution. (F) To compare populations of virus that are able to detach from infected cell to those that remain bound to the cell surface with or without NAIs, we collect virus in two separate stages: first, we harvest virus from media at 16hpi, followed by the addition of media supplemented with an exogenous, oseltamivir-resistant bacterial neuraminidase. After one hour of treatment with exogenous NA, we harvest virus that had previously remained bound to the cell surface.

Of the three rotational degrees of freedom, only rotations in \u03b8 are considered in our simulations of cylindrical particles. Rotations in \u03c8 (which reduce the number of possible HA-SA interactions) are not observed experimentally. Rotations in \u03c6 likely occur, but do not appreciably change the number and location of HA and NA molecules proximal to the surface. Unlike cylindrical particles, spherical particles would be expected to rotate about \u03b8, \u03c6, and \u03c8, leading to variations in the number of NAs proximal to the surface over time which would tend to randomize the virus\u2019s direction of motion. As a result, spherical particles are not included in simulations. (B) Model for virus binding and diffusion accounting for multivalent adhesion of HA, turnover of proximal substrates by NA, and thermal fluctuations constrained by the position of bound HA-SA pairs. The virus is modeled as a lattice of HA and NA whose distributions are specified. Viruses interact with uniform distributions of sialic acid on a two-dimensional surface. HAs within a 7.5 nm radius of sialic acid can probabilistically bind, while NAs within the same radius can probabilistically cleave. Once bound, virus position and bearing can change only if it does not displace any bound HA-SA pairs beyond the specified binding radius (7.5 nm in these simulations).",

While most HAs sample from uniform distributions of sialic acid, those close to the NA cluster have a higher probability of binding to sialic acid that is offset from the HA in the positive direction. This results in a persistent bias in the direction of virus diffusion (bottom). (B) and (C) Similar to (A), but with two different types of symmetric NA distributions. In both cases, symmetric distributions of sialic acid (middle) result in symmetric random walks (bottom). In the one-dimensional case shown here, although the probability of positive or negative displacements are initially equal, once a displacement direction is established, the virus will tend to continue in the established direction. (D) Results of two-dimensional simulations with varying organizations of NA on the virus\u2019s surface. Although localizing NA to one of the virus\u2019s poles (\u2018polar\u2019 configuration) produces consistent oriented motion, introducing separation between HA-rich and NA-rich regions with the same NA localization (\u2018gapped\u2019 configuration) eliminates this tendency, as does localizing NA to both viral poles (\u2018bipolar\u2019 configuration). Having moderately polarized NA distributions also suppresses oriented motion, since this configuration (\u2018off-center\u2019) creates gradients in sialic acid density that partially cancel out over the length of the virus. Finally, NA in a random, uniformly-distributed configuration results in diffusion in a random direction. Because this configuration leads to more efficient cleavage of sialic acid and thus weaker virus adhesion, these simulations were performed with a lower number of total NAs (6 vs. 16) to prevent the virus from detaching altogether.",
