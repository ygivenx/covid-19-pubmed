Through analyses of a total of 377 H1N1-associated deaths in the United States, Fowlkes et al. demonstrated that the H1N1-associated mortality rate varied substantially in different geographic regions (i.e. highest in Hawaii, New York and Utah) and in different age groups of the infected population (i.e. 76% in patients aged 18\u201365 years and 9% in patients aged \u2265 65 years) [5]. Similar geographic region- and patient age-dependent incidence of H1N1 infection and subsequent mortality have also been demonstrated in South America [6], and Australia [7]. In addition, the susceptibility to H1N1 infection may vary in different races; Wenger et al. shown that Alaska Native people and Asian/Pacific Islanders (A/PI) were 2\u20134 times more likely to be infected by H1N1 virus and hospitalized than white Caucasians [8].",

Pathologically, the H1N1 virus has features similar to those encountered in the infection with other highly virulent influenza A viruses such as the 1918 H1N1 and H5N1 viruses [10]. However, as the disease was generally a mild procedure, typical inflammation molecules might not be qualified to serve as diagnostic markers. For patients with complications, the secondary bacterial infection which causes elevation in leucopenia and C-reactive protein is most likely to occur. The widely used antivirus treatment like oseltamivir might increase the proportion of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A. Therefore, alternative treatment and vaccination (although, low coverage) are highly recommended.",

However, how to integrate GIS into the traditional epidemiological model is a key challenge[16]. Use of GIS in our analyses in this study showed that the incidence of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic in mainland China was higher in the coastal provinces in the southeast as well as in Beijing and Shanghai, two of the most populous cities in the country, where the infection occurred in clusters in the initial phase, followed by spread to adjacent provinces. Moreover, the analyses also demonstrated that within some of the provinces with confirmed cases, the number of H1N1 infection varied widely as well. In most cities and districts, there was still no H1N1 confirmed cases, the overall spread level of H1N1 virus was still regional. Nevertheless, our analyses on the H1N1 spread and the geographic distribution were qualitative only; further quantitative analyses such as correlation or Poisson regression are needed to test the hypothesis that the H1N1 virus spreads more quickly in the crowd area with more convenient travel system.",
