The HA of human influenza viruses preferentially binds to terminal sialic acid (SA) residues with \u03b12,6 linkages, whereas avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to SA with \u03b12,3 linkages [6]\u2013[9]. The prevalence of \u03b12,6 SA but paucity of \u03b12,3 SA in the human respiratory tract has been considered to restrict infection by avian influenza viruses [10]. Recent reports, however, have detected significant levels of \u03b12,3 SA on human airway epithelium both in vitro and ex vivo, including in nasopharyngeal and tracheobronchial tissue [11]\u2013[14]. This SA distribution also correlated with avian influenza virus infection in vitro and ex vivo and raised the possibility that avian viruses could infect the upper airways in vivo. Therefore, although it is universally accepted that human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses requires adaptation of HA to switch from \u03b12,3 to \u03b12,6 SA usage, the cumulative data published to date indicate that SA linkages and their respective distribution in the human airways are not the sole barrier to avian influenza virus infection [15]\u2013[17]. Other host factors and viral genes are likely also important determinants of infectivity.",

Avian influenza viruses are adapted for replication in the avian enteric tract at 40\u201341\u00b0C. While the surface temperatures of the human respiratory tract are variable, a temperature gradient clearly exists in which the surface temperature of the proximal large airways (i.e., nasal and tracheal) average 32+/\u22120.05\u00b0C while temperatures of the smaller, distal airways (i.e., bronchioles) are closer to that of the core body temperature, 37\u00b0C [18],[19]. While multiple transmission routes have been described for influenza viruses, the proximal airways likely represent a predominant site for human influenza virus inoculation as they provide a large exposed surface area of virus-susceptible epithelial cells [20]. These cells are directly accessible by large droplet aerosols and by way of digital inoculation of the nasopharynx and conjunctival mucosa [12],[21]. Inefficient infection by avian influenza viruses, even in the presence of \u03b12,3-linked SA, may be due to the cooler temperature of the proximal airways compared to that of the distal airways/lung regions where H5N1 avian influenza viruses appear to replicate efficiently [22].",

Lysine substitution at residue 627 of H5N1 viruses improved virus replication in mice [24]. In addition to PB2, work utilizing human-avian reassortant viruses in MDCK cells provided initial evidence that avian glycoproteins, HA and neuraminidase (NA), may mediate temperature-dependent effects on viral growth [25]. To our knowledge, other viral genes have not been well characterized, nor the HA and NA further evaluated, in their contribution to temperature sensitivity of avian influenza viruses.",

            "text": "To characterize the temperature dependency of avian vs. human influenza viruses in a relevant model of the target cell types of the human airways, we utilized an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE). This model closely mimics the morphological and physiological features of the human airway epithelium in vivo and has been previously used to investigate infection by diverse respiratory viruses [26]\u2013[30]. In humans, ciliated airway epithelium is present throughout the airways, extending from the nasal cavity and large proximal airways into the distal bronchiolar airway regions. Previously, we have shown that both human and avian influenza viruses replicate well in HAE and that human and avian influenza virus cell tropism correlates with the respective distribution of the specific sialic acid linkages [13]. However, these previous studies were conducted at 37\u00b0C, reflecting conditions encountered in the distal airways [13]. Others have also utilized these airway cell systems to characterize influenza virus replication of wild-type and recombinant viruses at 35\u00b0C [14],[31],[32]. In the present study, we utilize the HAE model, in combination with influenza virus reverse genetics, to investigate the influence of temperature on human and avian influenza virus infection, replication and spread. We demonstrate that, compared to human influenza viruses, avian influenza viruses are severely restricted for infection of human airway epithelium at the temperature of the human proximal airways. Then, using different strategies to \u2018avianize\u2019 human influenza viruses, we show that the temperature restriction of avian viruses is closely associated with the avian HA and NA glycoproteins.",

A loss of titer was also observed for A/Dk/Eng/62 at 32\u00b0C, but not before 120 hrs pi. To determine if loss of titer after reaching maximum levels correlated with increased CPE, we quantified adenylate kinase (AK) release by dead/dying cells into the apical compartment as a sensitive and global measure of cytotoxicity across the entire epithelial cell culture surface. Figure 1B indicates that substantial increases in AK levels, indicative of the onset of CPE, are first detected at 48 hrs pi for A/Victoria/3/75 at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C and A/Dk/Eng/62 at 37\u00b0C. This induction of AK coincided with peak viral titer for these viruses under these conditions (compare Figure 1A and 1B) and suggested that the loss of titer correlated with the onset of CPE. Increasing levels of AK between 48 and 96 hrs pi were directly associated with continually decreasing viral titers, further supporting this claim.",

This assertion is supported by the fact that trends in viral titers at a given time point are mirrored in AK levels detected 48 hrs later (e.g., compare viral titers at 48 hr pi (Figure 1A) to AK measurements taken at 96 hr pi (Figure 1B)). Since viral titer and AK levels could be related to the numbers of cells infected and/or the degree of virus replication within individual cells we compared titers of human and avian influenza viruses (Figure 1A) to the numbers of cells infected by each virus at the two temperatures over time. Immunodetection of viral antigen in inoculated HAE showed that human and avian influenza virus antigen was not detected 3 hrs pi, indicating that levels of antigen in residual viral inocula were below the limit of antibody detection (data not shown). For A/Victoria/3/75, a few isolated cells were positive for viral antigen by 6 hrs pi at 37\u00b0C, but by 24 hrs pi considerable numbers of antigen-positive cells were detected (Figure 2A). In agreement with our growth curves in Figure 1A, A/Victoria/3/75 infected slightly fewer cells at 32\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C at 24 hrs pi, but importantly, A/Victoria/3/75 spread efficiently within the epithelium at both temperatures and differences in infection at early time points became less significant over time (Figure 2A).",

However, it should be noted that antigen-positive cells in en face images are viewed linearly (Figure 2A) whereas viral titers are shown on a logarithmic scale (Figure 1A). Thus, an apparently small difference in titer as is seen at 24 hrs pi between A/Victoria/3/75 and A/Dk/Eng/62 at 37\u00b0C may correspond to a larger difference in the number of cells positive for viral antigen. While our staining also confirmed previous data that avian influenza viruses infect fewer human airway epithelial cells in comparison to human influenza virus at 37\u00b0C (Figure 2A; [13]), the limited extent of A/Dk/Eng/62 antigen positive cells at 37\u00b0C by 24 hr pi was still unexpected given that titers at this time were slightly greater than those for A/Victoria/3/75 at 32\u00b0C. Whether this represents a difference in yield of infectious virus per infected cell between human and avian viruses is presently not clear. Overall, A/Dk/Eng/62 grew and spread well at 37\u00b0C, but was severely restricted for growth at 32\u00b0C and antigen positive cells were barely detectable before 48 hr pi for this virus at lower temperature.",

Further evaluation of histological cross-sections indicated that A/Victoria/3/75 infection at 37\u00b0C, which had the highest and earliest induction of AK, resulted in the earliest evidence of morphological injury at 72 hrs pi. HAE infected with A/Victoria/3/75 at 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C or A/Dk/Eng/62 at 37\u00b0C all showed desquamation of the superficial layer of columnar epithelial cells with basal epithelial cells remaining attached to the matrix support by 120 hrs pi (Figure 2B). Similar cytopathology has been reported for A/Udorn/307/72 influenza virus infection of HAE in vitro and for clinical human influenza virus infection in vivo\n[29],[33]. The detection of AK in apical washes of A/Dk/Eng/62-infected HAE at 32\u00b0C suggested that this virus did eventually compromise cellular integrity at the lower temperature, but dramatic morphological effects were not seen at least for up to 120 hrs (Figure 1B and 2B). It should be noted, however, that at 120 hrs pi, A/Dk/Eng/62-infected HAE at 32\u00b0C did display some morphological characteristics different from uninfected and infected HAE at earlier time-points. Preliminary assessment indicates that expansion of lateral spaces between the columnar epithelial cells had occurred. Although we do not know the significance of these morphological changes, we speculate these observations are the initiation of CPE that will ultimately result in similar cellular injury as seen for this virus at 37\u00b0C and human viruses at both temperatures.",

By 72 and 120 hrs pi considerable loss of cells from the culture was evident and this correlated with the drop off in viral titers at these time points (Figure 1A). Thus, we conclude that in the context of maximal infection in which there were no additional target cells available for infection within the finite surface area of the HAE culture, ongoing replication in antigen-positive cells shown at 48 and 72 hrs pi resulted in increased cell death. This CPE led to a reduction in the number of viable, virus-producing cells and in turn, to a reduction in progeny virus. Although A/Dk/Eng/62 induced CPE when sufficient titers were generated at 37\u00b0C, one consequence of restricted replication of this avian influenza virus at 32\u00b0C was a reduction in overt CPE in HAE, even at later time points associated with considerable viral titers.",

We compared infection kinetics of H5N1 (A/VN/1203/04) at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C on HAE using A/Udorn/307/72 in parallel cultures as a human influenza virus control. As described above, A/Udorn/307/72 grew with similar kinetics at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C (Figure 3B). A/VN/1203/04, however, exhibited slower replication kinetics at 33\u00b0C when compared to that for 37\u00b0C (Figure 3D). Indeed, titers were significantly decreased at 33\u00b0C vs. 37\u00b0C at 24, 48 and 72 hrs pi. In addition, only at 37\u00b0C did A/VN/1203/04 approach similar peak titers as the human A/Udorn/307/72 virus by the end of the 72 hr time course (Figure 3D). Histological analyses of A/VN/1203/04-infected HAE at either temperature showed absence of obvious CPE in sharp contrast to A/Udorn/307/72 that obliterated the epithelium by 72 hrs pi (Figure 3E). The lack of obvious CPE after H5N1 infection contrasts reports that H5N1 induced extensive apoptosis in mammalian airway cells [35],[36]. The fact that we did not observe obvious CPE with this highly pathogenic virus warrants further investigation but is in line with the limited cell damage shown following infection with A/Dk/Eng/62 for 72 hrs (Figure 2B). In sum, using diverse examples of human and avian influenza viruses we have shown that avian influenza viruses, but not human influenza viruses, are restricted for infection and growth in HAE at the lower temperature of 32\u00b0C.",

            "text": "Previously, the polymerase subunit PB2 has been shown to play an important role in host range restriction of avian influenza viruses in mammalian cells [37]\u2013[39]. In influenza virus strains that circulate in humans, amino acid residue 627 in PB2 is a lysine, whereas in the majority of avian strains it is a conserved glutamic acid residue. The presence of glutamic acid at PB2 627 (avian-like) has been reported to account for the lower replication of avian influenza strains in mammalian cells and has been linked with reduced polymerase activity at lower temperature (33\u00b0C) in some cell systems [23],[24]. To assess the potential impact of this PB2 amino acid residue in restriction of avian influenza viruses at 32\u00b0C, we generated a recombinant A/Victoria/3/75 virus containing the PB2 K627E mutation and compared its growth with that of the isogenic wild-type virus in HAE at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. The K627E mutation resulted in restriction of the virus at both temperatures (Figure 4Ai), and although titer at 32\u00b0C was 1.3 logs lower than at 37\u00b0C at 24 hrs pi, this difference was no greater than the differences in growth for wild-type virus at these temperatures (1.5 logs; Figure 4Ai). Moreover, at the later time points analyzed, 48 and 72 hrs pi, the PB2 mutant did not show a significant difference in titer between the two temperatures. These data indicate that the K627E mutant virus was restricted for growth in HAE but that restriction was not temperature-dependent. Indeed, quantification of the numbers of infected cells identified by en face staining revealed that the K627E mutant virus infected a similar percentage of cells compared to wild-type virus at 24 hrs pi (Figure 4Aii) and that the mutant was capable of spread since new cells were infected by 48 hrs with similar kinetics to that of wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 at both 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C (Figure 4Aii). Statistically, there was no difference between the wild-type and PB2 mutant viruses at either 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C at 48 hrs pi with respect to percent influenza virus-antigen positive epithelium. Together, these data suggest that the amino acid residue at PB2 627 influences viral fitness in HAE, but does not confer to a human virus the temperature-dependent phenotype of avian influenza virus infection in human ciliated airway epithelium.",

Several events in the viral life cycle that are critical for spread, including release of progeny virions from previously infected cells and attachment and entry into new target cells, are mediated by influenza virus glycoproteins. Thus, we hypothesized that glycoprotein function could be responsible for the restricted infection of HAE by avian influenza viruses at the lower temperature of 32\u00b0C. To test whether HA and/or NA contributed to the restricted phenotype of avian influenza viruses at 32\u00b0C, we used reverse genetics to generate mutant viruses genetically altered to confer avian virus-like glycoprotein specificities on the A/Victoria/3/75 background. First, mutations in HA previously shown to switch sialic acid usage from \u03b12,6 to \u03b12,3 linkages (L226Q, S228G) [40] were introduced to generate the Vic-226-228HA virus.

However, unlike the PB2 mutant virus, the difference between replication at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C for Vic 226-228HA was also significant at the 48 hour time point. Moreover, this mutant virus with avian virus-like sialic acid usage spread less efficiently than wild-type at 32\u00b0C so that by 48 hrs pi the number of virus antigen-positive cells was significantly different (Figure 4Bii). In contrast, at 37\u00b0C, Vic-226-228HA infected similar numbers of cells as the wild-type virus by 48 hrs; indeed, the mutant virus was able to spread significantly more efficiently at the higher temperature (Figure 4Bii).",

To eliminate the possibility that the restriction we observed with these recombinant viruses was due to an imbalance between the activities of the surface glycoproteins that were not evolutionarily optimized, we next generated reassorted influenza viruses on a common genetic background, possessing human or avian glycoproteins with co-evolved pairings. This was achieved using human recombinant A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in which the wild-type H1 and N1 glycoproteins were replaced by the H3 and N2 glycoprotein pair from A/Victoria/3/75 (generating PR8+Vic HA/NA) or the H7 and N1 glycoprotein pair from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 (generating PR8+Chick HA/NA, previously termed RD3) [41]. Since we and others have shown differential cell-type tropism between human and avian influenza virus in HAE [13],[14], we next determined if avianizing the human virus HA by mutation or substitution (in the presence or absence of an avian NA) recapitulated the cell-type tropism exhibited by wholly avian influenza viruses in HAE. As shown by immunofluorescent detection in histological sections of infected HAE, PR8 containing A/Victoria/3/75 glycoproteins infected both ciliated and non-ciliated cells in HAE with a tropism similar to wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 (Figure 5). In contrast, A/Victoria/3/75 with two avian-like amino acid substitutions in HA and PR8+Chick HA/NA only infected ciliated cells, a tropism that was mirrored by wholly avian virus [13],[14]. These data clearly show that the ciliated cell tropism of avian influenza viruses is dictated by properties of the viral glycoproteins. These results correlate with the known increased sialic acid binding preference of avian HA for \u03b12,3-linked SA, and to the presence of \u03b12,3-linked SA on ciliated cells in HAE [8],[13],[14].",

AK activity measured in cultures at this temperature increased with similar kinetics and reached similar levels as AK measured in cultures inoculated with PR8+Vic HA/NA at either temperature.

Our data show that avian and avianized influenza viruses are restricted for infection and growth in HAE at 32\u00b0C but not 37\u00b0C, while human viruses infect and grow efficiently at both temperatures. Based on these data, we suggest that while the warmer temperatures of the distal airways enable comparable infection by both human and avian influenza viruses, the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways only support efficient and robust infection of the ciliated airway epithelium by human influenza viruses. We speculate that the observed restriction for avian and \u2018avianized\u2019 viruses in HAE would render avian influenza viruses more susceptible to innate and adaptive immune responses that limit pathogenicity in vivo. These results have significant impact on our understanding of why avian influenza viruses rarely undergo zoonotic transmission and why, when the rare human case does occur, that avian influenza virus infection and pathology manifest predominately in the warmer distal airways and lungs.",

In the present study, mutating position 627 in a human virus PB2 to an avian virus conserved residue resulted in growth restriction at both 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, suggesting that this residue is important for general viral fitness in HAE, but is not responsible for the differences in infection seen at 32\u00b0C vs. 37\u00b0C. Two recent reports also found that viruses with 627E in PB2 were attenuated regardless of temperature in human bronchial epithelial cells and MDCK cells, respectively, although in other cell systems including human small airway epithelial cells, a temperature specific effect was found [24],[42]. It should be emphasized that those studies were performed in non-differentiated epithelial cells unlike our studies that use human differentiated airway epithelial cells. We and others have previously shown that differentiated airway epithelial cell models enable discrimination of attenuated phenotypes of respiratory virus infection whereas non-differentiated cells do not [26],[27],[43]. In addition, we also show using HAE, that the H5N1 strain A/VN/1203/04, which possesses a lysine at position 627 (human adaptation), is still restricted for growth at 32\u00b0C, albeit less so than avian influenza viruses that have never infected humans. The attenuation in HAE of this H5N1 isolate which possesses a \u201chuman\u201d amino acid at residue 627 in PB2 suggests other residues in the polymerase subunit or other viral proteins altogether are involved in temperature sensitivity of avian influenza viruses.",

Previous work by Kaverin and colleagues also demonstrated temperature effects on growth of human-avian reassortant viruses containing avian glycoproteins [25], although this work was performed in non-polarized MDCK cells and did not investigate additional correlates of infection such as spread and CPE. In our study, we generated recombinant influenza viruses based on the A/Victoria/3/75 or A/PR/8/34 genetic backbone that were engineered to contain avian-like and/or avian glycoproteins and characterized infection in HAE. Kinetic studies showed that although human influenza viruses that possessed avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins were modestly restricted compared to wild-type viruses at 37\u00b0C, these mutant viruses were able spread like wild-type viruses throughout HAE at this temperature. Wide-spread infection throughout HAE was even observed for viruses in which their endogenous HA was replaced or mutated to preferentially bind \u03b12,3 SA, restricting tropism to ciliated cells. Efficient replication of Vic-226-228HA at 37\u00b0C in our studies corroborates previous work by Matrosovich and colleagues in which little effect of HA-specificity \u2018switching\u2019 on replication was noted unless a very low MOI (0.00004) was used for inoculation [44]. In contrast, Wan and Perez described more profound differences in replication in HAE at 37\u00b0C with recombinant viruses that differed only in their receptor specificity [31]. However, it should be noted that their recombinant viruses were based on an H9N2 avian strain that yielded relatively low titers, and their initial infections were performed at 35\u00b0C before incubating at 37\u00b0C [31].",

Notably, the H5N1 strain examined in this study also maintains preference for \u03b12,3 SA binding [45]; thus, we may surmise that this characteristic of A/VN/1203/04 contributes to its attenuation observed in HAE. The contribution of \u03b12,3 SA usage to replication of influenza viruses investigated by Hatta et al. in the upper respiratory tract of mice may have been masked in the mouse model (the 627 mutation in PB2 being more apparent) as mice express solely avian virus-like receptors (\u03b12,3 SA) in their airways [46]. Restriction of \u03b12,3 SA-binding viruses in HAE at 32\u00b0C was not due to a discrepancy in SA expression since HAE maintained at either 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C expressed similar levels of \u03b12,6 and \u03b12,3 SA (as detected by Sambucus nigra (SNA) and Maackia amurensis (MAA) lectin staining, respectively; data not shown).",

Using standard laboratory assays that employ small monovalent soluble substrates for cleavage by NA (MUNANA), we were not able to demonstrate any temperature-dependent loss of NA activity associated with either human or avian virus (data not shown).

The ability of A/Victoria/3/75 viruses with mutations or substitutions in either the HA or NA alone to infect similar numbers of cells and replicate to comparable peak titers as for wild-type virus at 37\u00b0C implies that these viruses were not crippled by the mismatch between the specificities of their HA and NA. Replication and spread of influenza viruses that possess an avian HA paired with its \u201cmatched\u201d NA was even more compromised than that of recombinant viruses with individual changes to levels seen with wholly avian viruses. Thus, viruses with co-evolved glycoprotein pairs exhibit restricted replication at low temperatures and both HA and NA genes contribute to the phenotype.",

            "text": "Together, these data imply that in the complex environment of the luminal surface of the human ciliated airway epithelium, the viral surface antigens have a marked effect on the extent of virus infection and that temperature plays an important role in limiting avian, but not human, influenza virus infection and spread in the cooler proximal airway regions. Given these results, we draw attention to other recently published data using the HAE model in which mutations in viruses that are growth attenuated in vivo display similar growth attenuation in HAE but not in non-differentiated cell lines, suggesting that HAE possess discriminating properties of attenuating phenotypes of mutants of respiratory viruses [26],[27]. Admittedly, in the present study, despite restriction in both growth and spread, wild-type avian viruses and human viruses with avian or avian-like glycoproteins did eventually reach high titer at 32\u00b0C at later time points. The efficiency of infection and replication of a virus that inoculates the airway epithelium, however, is likely a critical factor in determining whether the virus is capable of establishing infection in a host that normally possesses innate and adaptive immune systems that attempt to limit virus infection and spread. At temperatures of the distal airways, avian influenza viruses displayed similar infection kinetics as human influenza viruses and would therefore, in the case of sufficient inoculum reaching these distal regions, be as likely to establish infection. Indeed, the clinical pathology findings for humans infected with H5N1 do report distal airway infection in ciliated bronchioles and lung regions [22]. Under these conditions of inoculation and infection, avian influenza viruses present in the distal airways may still be unable to spread to proximal airway regions without additional adaptation to cooler temperatures. One caveat of this prediction is that virus may be transported to proximal airway regions by innate mucus clearance mechanisms indicating that caution is required when attempting to identify proximal infection by viruses in airway secretions obtained from tracheal swabs.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the present study substantiates differential host temperature as a critical barrier for infection by avian influenza viruses. Since the ciliated airway epithelium of the proximal airways is a major portal for influenza virus infection and spread, accessible by multiple inoculation routes (e.g., ocular, nasopharyngeal or aerosol), the inability of avian influenza viruses to establish infection and spread in these regions would be predicted to reduce the frequency of successful zoonotic transmission. Furthermore, the ability of human influenza viruses to generate high viral titers in the human proximal airways is likely a factor in effective human-to-human transmission and the induction of airway epithelial cell cytotoxicity as shown in this study may increase particulate matter perhaps associated with virus that facilitates inoculation of new hosts. Rapid induction of cytotopathic effects by human, but not avian, influenza virus infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways may also contribute to the onset of other host defenses such as sneezing and coughing that facilitate clearance of particulate matter/virus from the airways and potentially promote transmission between human hosts.",

A/Dk/Singapore/97 (H5N3) and A/Dk/England/62 (H4N6) are typical avian influenza strains that have been passaged in both embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK cells during laboratory handling. Highly pathogenic A/VN/1203/04 (H5N1) was biologically derived and minimally passaged in embryonated chicken eggs.

Recombinant viruses, including wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) and mutants in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/24 (H1N1) background, were generated from cloned cDNA in 293T and MDCK cell co-cultures as previously described [52],[53]. Mutant viruses were generated in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background as follows: 1) Vic 627PB2; A/Victoria/3/75 containing a lysine to glutamic acid amino acid substitution at position 627; 2) Vic-226-228HA; A/Victoria/3/75 containing two amino acid substitutions in the HA gene (L226Q, S228G) that confer an avian-like receptor binding preference [6],[40]; 3) Vic+Chick N1; A/Victoria/3/75 in which segment 6 containing the endogenous N2 NA gene was exchanged for the N1 NA gene from avian isolate A/Chick/Italy/1347/99; 4) Vic-226-228HA+Chick N1; A/Victoria/3/75 containing both L226Q and S228G mutations and the avian N1; 5) PR8+Vic HA/NA; A/PR/8/34 in which the endogenous H1 and N1 were replaced with the H3 and N2 from A/Victoria/3/75 and 6) PR8+Chick HA/NA (RD3); A/PR/8/34 in which the endogenous H1 and N1 were replaced with the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99.

Data obtained in parallel for wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 is repeated in each graph (striped bars) for comparison to the mutant (solid bars). Data shown represents the mean of the percentage of influenza virus antigen-positive epithelium across 10 different fields +/\u2212SE. Differences in viral antigen positive epithelium between temperatures for each virus at 48 hrs pi is noted as significant (*p<0.05) or insignificant (NS). A one-way ANOVA model showed no significant differences between the wild-type virus and PB2 mutant at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C at 48 hrs pi. (Dii) Representative en face photomicrographs of HAE inoculated with A/Victoria/3/75 or Vic (226\u2013228)HA+Chick N1 at either 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C and stained for viral nucleoprotein (green) to determine numbers of cells infected 72 hrs pi. Scale bar represents 100 \u00b5m.",

Arrows mark ciliated cells infected with either wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 or PR8+Vic HA/NA; arrow-head denotes non-ciliated cells infected by these viruses. These data indicate that viruses with Victoria glycoproteins were able to infect both cell types previously shown to express \u03b12,6 SA [13]. Viral antigen was detected only in ciliated cells in cultures inoculated with Vic-226-228HA (in the Victoria background with either endogenous N2 or avian N1 or PR8+Chick HA/NA).
