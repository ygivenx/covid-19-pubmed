Male is predominant with the male to female ratio about 1.5 : 1 [2]. The incidence of KD varies around the world. It is 20 times more common in North East Asia. The highest rate was reported in Japan as 218.6 per 100,000 children from 0 to 4 years of age in the year 2008, 69 per 100,000 children under 5 years old in Taiwan, 86.4 per 100,000 in Korea, 20.8 per 100,000 in the USA, and 8.39 per 100,000 in England. The annual survey of KD shows the incidence rate increases year by year [3\u20137]. ",

This may make the diagnosis challenging and delay intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Such delay causes higher probability of developing CAA [12]. The cutoff points of infant's age in previous studies were 6 months or 1 year old [8\u201311, 13, 14]. Both of the age spectrums revealed similar results. In our study, we further subdivide infant age into \u22646 months old and 7 months to 1 year old.

Other clinical and laboratory findings such as leukocytosis, elevated CRP, diarrhea, cough, rhinorrhea, and perianal desquamation are also suggestive of the diagnosis [17]. The major complication of KD is CAA, which includes coronary artery dilatation and coronary aneurysm [17]. CAA may cause myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, or sudden death [18, 19]. Previous reports have shown that patients <1 year old are more likely to have incomplete KD and CAA [10, 11, 20].

Laboratory factors include lower hemoglobin level [25, 28, 29], higher platelet count [24, 30], higher WBC count [28, 29], lower serum albumin [31], and higher alanine aminotransferase [29]. The three most commonly reported laboratory factors were lower hemoglobin level, higher platelet count, and lower albumin level [9]. Although infants younger than 4 months old experienced physiologic anemia, infants in this study showed that those \u22646 months old had not only the least favorable laboratory results, but also the highest rate of coronary artery dilatation. Even not statistically significant between group 1 and 3, infants \u22646 months old were also seen to have the trend of much coronary artery giant aneurysm comparing to other age spectrums. In addition to the unfavorable laboratory results, in this study, infants \u22646 months had longer days between the disease onset to diagnosis, more incomplete KD, and fewer patients fulfilling the diagnosis criteria within 10 days, which were also risk factors of CAA [24\u201326, 32]. In our study, we demonstrated that infants \u22646 months were more vulnerable of having CAA in comparison to those <1 year old [8, 10, 13, 22, 31].",

            "text": "Besides that the risk factors of CAA are more in KD's infants younger than 6 months old, the difference of coronary artery anatomy by age might exacerbate the possibility of CAA. The pathogenesis of the vasculitis in KD had been proposed by several literatures. Jennette [33] described that the earliest lesion of CAA is subendothelial accumulation of leukocytes, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and T-lymphocytes [34]. The following transmural infiltration of mononuclear lymphocytes results in transmural inflammation as well as smooth muscle cell edema and degeneration in the vascular media. With the disease progress, the infiltration extends from the vascular media into the adventitia. Finally, the cascade of events result in destructions of the vascular media and aneurysm formation [35]. In human coronary artery, Ikari et al. [36] performed serial coronary artery sections for babies from 17-week gestation to 23 months after birth. They found that the coronary artery intima is rarely noted before 30-week gestation. Only 38% of the newborns have coronary artery intima in the first week of life with intima/media ratio nearly 0.1. Until three months after birth, vascular intima can be detected in all infants. This result gave us a hint that there might be a relationship between the delayed development of the vascular intima and the higher rate of CAA. The higher CAA incidence in infants \u22646 months old might be due to the loss of or a thin vascular intima in young infants. Large amount of the leukocytes may penetrate the endothelium and infiltrate into the media and the adventitia easier if there is no or a thin endothelium. Large amount of the infiltrations would cause more severe vascular inflammation with serious vascular medial destruction and aneurysm formation.",

In our study, patients <1 year old have statistically higher WBC count comparing to those older than 1 year of age. Multiple reports have indicated that an infectious agent is highly possibly the etiology of KD. Burns et al. [37] had suggested an environmental trigger in KD due to pronounced seasonality and temporal clustering of cases in Japan. Esper et al. [38] had found \u201cNew Haven Coronavirus\u201d in KD patients' respiratory secretion. Rowley et al. [39] had used IgA antibody and detected a specific antigen within the coronary arteries, bronchial epithelium, and inflamed KD tissues. These results have been supporting the hypothesis that infection is the etiology of KD. The leukocytosis in KD might be due to the systemic reaction toward infection as well as acute inflammation of the coronary arteries. Focal inflammation of the coronary artery, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) in adult, can also cause leukocytosis [22, 24, 25]. In patients with KD, with the medium-sized elastic arteries inflammation, coronary artery inflammation should at least be part of the reason of leukocytosis.",

In our study, we have found the trend of increasing incidence of female patients with age. However, the reason was unknown or might be due to our small sample size. Urinalysis revealed sterile pyuria in about 33% of the KD's patient. This was probably due to urethritis instead of bacterial urinary tract infection [17]. In our study, sterile pyuria is more frequent in patients <1 year than older children. That might indicate that infants younger than 1 year old suffer from more serious urethritis than children. We have also demonstrated that neck lymphadenopathy is the least common sign of the KD's five major clinical criteria in infants <1 year old. Therefore, echocardiography should be performed to evaluate coronary artery in infants who have prolonged fever with the suggestive KD's clinical signs and laboratory results.",
