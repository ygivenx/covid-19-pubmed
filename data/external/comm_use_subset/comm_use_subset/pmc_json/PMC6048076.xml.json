Ticks spend almost all their time with the host and move from one point to another with them. Female ticks leave their host and fall into the environment, lay eggs when they are fully engorged. New larvae will look for another host, and the cycle will restart [1]. Tick-borne diseases have a significant impact on animal productivity and cause economic losses for livestock owners. This is a major obstacle for the livestock sector development in Africa and Benin, in particular, due to the presence of a large number of tick species including Rhipicephalus mipcroplus (Rm), one of the most feared species [2]. The previous study has shown that Rm is a vector of Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, and Anaplasma marginale [3]. In Benin, the introduction of Rm was largely attributed to the importation of Girolando cattle from Brazil by the Government of Benin through the Pafilav Project which aim was to improve local breed milk production [4]. The first study conducted on October 2008 in the village of Kpinnou, the main site of Girolando cattle in Benin, indicated the presence of Rm and the suitability of local conditions for its development [5]. As stated by different findings, this tick species has rapidly spread all over the country [6]. Ticks collection and identification from domestic animals were done several times for research purposes.",

For pastoralist, wildlife can be the cause of economic disasters when the survival or profitability of the domestic herd is threatened by epizootics or endozooties in which the fauna acts as a carrier, reservoir, or intermediate host [13]. However, no investigation has yet been done on wild species following the identification and spread of Rm, which stands out for its resistance to common acaricides and is a real problem for ruminant farms in Benin [14].",

It has also been identified in Senegal on Luzarches hartebeest and then the bushbuck and warthog in the Niokolo-koba National Park. In the North East of Central Africa, the work of Thal [25] also mentioned the presence of this species on hartebeest and roan. Indeed, according to this author, it is the only Boophilus that could be found on wild ungulates in West Africa. However, although our samples were taken from ungulates such as C. elaphus, Syncerus caffer planiceros, Kobus kob, Tragelaphus scrip tus, and Phacochoerus aethiopi cus, this species has not been identified. Its absence could be linked to a mutation phenomenon leading to the appearance of Rm. This phenomenon was already described in East Africa where Rm replaced the other Rhipicephalus species [26]. The highest presence Rm in the hunting camp of the Mekrou and Koncombri can be explained by the fact that there are next to Burkina Faso. Moreover, the presence of water table next to W park hunting area in Popoman attract transhumant animals from Burkina-Faso and could explain the strong representation of Rm in the Mekrou area. Indeed, these camps are located at the Benin-Burkina border where there is a large movement of live cattle from Burkina to Benin through livestock trade. This is corroborated by recent findings that revealed the presence of this tick in Benin and Benin-Burkina Faso border [27].",

However, Rhipicephalus spp. is present in all the prospected localities. The absence of R. sanguineus in this study in the parks may be related to the prohibition of hunting that would have limited dog access to the parks. In fact, illegal hunters are often accompanied by their dogs, which constitute the main host of R. sanguineus in the tropics and subtropics as reported by Fahmy et al. [30]. A high probability of dissemination of this tick on the natural route by these dogs and thus an infestation of wild animals is possible. This has been proven by the work of Smith et al. [31].",

Indeed, previous work carried in the same areas and during the same month\u2019s revealed low abundance of nymph and larva [34]. This observation can be explained by several factors such as the height of the animals considered, targeted animals are old, and old animals are big in size what make does not favor nymph and larva to attach to them; the climate: February and March are hot and larva and nymph are more sensitive to heat than adults. Moreover, this period is the most favorable for the availability of wildfowl, and illegal hunters use bushfires to find wildfowl. As a result, these bushfires, kill immature ticks hidden in the environment. According to Verdonck [35], immature survival is very dependent on humidity during the hot season; the abundance of Rm, for example, begins to decrease at the end of the rainy season. Likewise, tick activity varies according to species and climatic conditions [36]. However, the massive presence of ticks does not always correspond to the rainiest months. Farougou et al. [22] showed a low correlation between rainfall and number of ticks collected. This result can be explained by the fact that some ticks appear before the rainy season. The finding may also be related to genus and stage of development that persist in moisture and sometimes other sources of moisture at the vegetation level. Similarly, Fahmy et al. [30] showed that Rm can grow in warm and humid regions, B. decoloratus in dry and cold areas, and Boophilus annulatus can survive in areas suitable both for Rm and B. decoloratus. This fact has also been confirmed by several researchers [37,38]. Madder et al. [27] and Muhimuzi et al. [39] also reported that B. annulatus and B. geigyi might share the same habitats associated with woods and forests and favor similar environmental requirements as well.",

Although the number of animals surveyed and the number of ticks taken are low for specific reasons related to the low parasite load of the animals encountered, the reluctance of some illegal hunters and the limited number of legal hunters with a hunting license at the level of national parks. 24 tick species have been recorded on wild animals in Upper Volta [23]; In the Democratic Republic of Congo, three species of ticks were identified on natural grasslands, including Rhipicephalus\nappendiculatus, B. decoloratus, and Haemaphysalis Leachi Leachi [39]. The lower number of tick collected in our case is due to the reluctance of some hunters to allow ticks collection from their animals. Moreover, the number of hunters that can be survey is also limited as few hunters own a hunting license.",

Wildlife is, therefore, an important risk factor that should not be neglected in the epidemiological surveillance and tick control strategies particularly Rm in Benin and the West African sub-region. Thus, it is important to involve in the programs of protection of the faunistic reserves the control of ticks in particular and a sanitary management of wildlife in general.",
