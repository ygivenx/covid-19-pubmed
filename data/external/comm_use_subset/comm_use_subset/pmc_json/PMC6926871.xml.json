With the primary screening, an initial assessment is carried out by personnel, who may not necessarily have public health or medical training. Activities include visual observation of travelers for signs of the infectious disease, measurement of travelers\u2019 body temperature, and completion of a questionnaire by travelers asking for presence of symptoms and/or exposure to the infectious agent. Travelers who have signs or symptoms of the infectious disease, or have been potentially exposed to the infectious agent, are referred to secondary screening. Secondary screening should be carried out by personnel with public health or medical training. It includes an in-depth interview, a focused medical and laboratory examination and second temperature measurement [1,12]. Specific objectives of entry or exit screening measures can include: identification of ill travelers who may have signs and symptoms, and of travelers who may have been exposed to a hazard and their close contacts; identification of appropriate public health measures, such as treatment, isolation, quarantine and travel restrictions that are commensurate with the risks and do not unduly interfere with international travel; proper collection of information and reporting of public health risks; provision of information and education to the traveling public about health risks.

New Zealand implemented entry screening for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [21]. In Canada, entry and exit screening was applied for SARS [9] and entry screening for EVD at airports [22]. Peru implemented entry screening for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [32]. In China, entry screening took place for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [40]. In Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali, exit screening was implemented for EVD at airports, seaports and ground crossings [6,16,22,28]. Japan implemented entry screening for EVD [38] and Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [24,26,39]. Singapore applied entry screening for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [36] and for SARS at airports, seaports and road entry points [23,29]. Taiwan applied entry screening at airports for SARS [35], Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [33] and Zika virus disease [7] as an ad hoc measure at airports in response to public health emergencies. Moreover, entry screening for Dengue [7,10,11,15] and Chikungunya [7] were implemented as routine measures at airports. Regarding European countries, Belgium and United Kingdom implemented entry screening at airports for EVD [22,27,37]. Table 4 summarizes the entry and exit screening measures. ",

As reported by Cohen et al., in the land borders of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, simple exit screening measures involving visual screening for illness at designated official border crossings were applied for EVD [16]. Due to sparse, understaffed, and under-resourced official border points of entry, land borders were characterized as \u201cporous\u201d and it was not possible to apply measures similar to airports. Two articles refer to entry screening measures implemented at the Eurostar terminal/train station at London St Pancras for EVD [22,37]. Measures included visual and fever screening.",

The exposure and symptom assessment methods, the tools and type of equipment used, and the number of staff involved and their training play an important role in the outcome of screening measures [50]. Screening protocols for symptoms and exposure assessment included questionnaires, health alert leaflets, visual checks, and body temperature measurements. Each method has its strengths and limitations [22]. In the reviewed evidence, self-reporting of exposure and symptoms in questionnaires relies on the honesty of the responder, language barriers exist, and fever symptoms can be concealed by antipyretic drug use [8]. Screening cannot detect incubating or asymptomatic travelers [24]. Fever and other symptoms are non-specific and planning and resources are needed for possible high demand of laboratory tests [22]. During the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015, (Figure 4) some travelers attempted to escape entry screening by presenting passports which did not show that they had traveled to an affected country [51]. In general, the prevalence of disease targeted by screening is very low among travelers, and the positive predictive values and the sensitivity of screening measures are expected to be very low for the diseases targeted through screening [9]. This is expected especially when general massive (to all travelers) rather than targeted screening measures (e.g., to travelers coming from affected countries or certain direct flights) are applied.",

In total, about 300,000 were screened in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, but no case was detected through exit screening measures. During the study reporting period, four confirmed cases were exported through air travel during the exit screening measure implementation, but were not symptomatic while traveling [16]. EVD is a disease with high pathogenicity and a very low number of asymptomatic cases [52]. Consequently, it is probably unlikely that additional cases would have been exported through air or sea travel without being detected by surveillance systems in the destination non-affected countries.

As reported by Cohen et al., the implementation of land-border screening measures was challenging given the high mobility of populations through formal and informal points [16]. It was not possible to apply at ground crossings the same protocols that were applied at airports and seaports. Exit screening at ground crossings combined visual checks for symptomatic persons at official ground crossings, health education, and community engagement, as well as implementation of plans for isolation, communication, assessment, referral, and transportation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published evidence meeting the inclusion/search criteria about the positive impact of screening measures at ground crossings in preventing the exportation of EVD cases from affected countries.

Exit screening measures may have balanced the overreactions. Exit screening measures enabled business continuity to trade and transport sectors, as well as the continuation of public health organizations and humanitarian missions to support the affected countries [16,27,28]. Another secondary effect of screening measures is that thorough exit screening measures at borders may have played a role in discouraging ill or exposed persons from attempting to leave the affected countries [25].

Evidence for achieving this primary objective is based on the measures implemented in response to the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015, SARS, Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and Zika virus disease, as well as entry screening measures implemented on a routine basis for Dengue fever and Chikungunya infection. None of the countries that implemented entry screening for SARS detected any case [8,9,23,29,35]. For Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 the detection rate ranged from 0.01 to 2.2 confirmed cases per 10,000 persons screened [20,21,24,26,32,33,39,40]. A survey conducted by WHO showed an aggregate rate of 4 confirmed cases per 1,000,000 screened travelers for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in 10 countries [50]. For EVD, no case was identified through entry screening measures [6,27,28,31,34,37,38]. For Zika virus disease, five cases were identified and more than 21,000,000 persons screened [7]. Routine entry screening measures for Dengue fever showed a detection rate of less than 8%. It should be noted that the diseases targeted by entry screenings such as SARS, EVD and the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have a very low prevalence among travelers, therefore the positive predictive value of entry screening is expected to be close to zero [9]. Cowling and colleagues compared the dates of the first reported case of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in countries which implemented entry screening measures with countries that did not implement such measures. They concluded that entry screening may delay the introduction of a new influenza strain for about 7\u201312 days [54]. However, it should be noted that it was not possible for the study to assess which measures other than entry screening implemented by the countries have contributed to delaying introduction. ",

However, the onset of symptoms was not assessed in all cases and it is not clear if the imported cases passed through screening were symptomatic or incubating. Entry screening at airports implemented on routine basis proved to be successful in Taiwan (an island) in identifying about half of the imported cases of Dengue fever [7,10]. Twelve out of 59 imported cases of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were detected through entry screening within 54 days of entry screening [33]. In Japan, 6.6% (10/151) of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases were identified by airport entry screening [39]. Another study in Japan showed that only 11 confirmed cases of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were detected through entry screening, but 633 cases were diagnosed among the Japanese population and about 20% of them had passed through the entry screening [26]. The detection rate of Dengue fever and Chikungunya infection was higher than that of influenza. This can be attributed to the difference in the severity of symptoms and whether it can be observable or measurable when passing the entry points at airports, as well as the rate of persons who will ask for medical care in the health care system and will be captured by the routine surveillance system. Moreover, this can be attribute to the fact that entry screening for vector-borne diseases in Taiwan has been implemented on a routine basis for long periods of time and not as part of response measures to emergencies that are implemented in short periods of time.

Entry screening alone seems to be ineffective in preventing or delaying introduction of diseases to a country; however, it could be justified for severe diseases, as part of a set of measures complementing each other, after setting priorities and where there are available resources [26]. The ECDC suggests that entry screening at airports in combination with exit screening could be of value, if exit screening measures are questionable and if the timeframe between departure and arrival at the destination country is long [22].

Crossing land borders for sick, symptomatic persons may be easier than moving through air or sea means of transport. The density of populations crossing land borders can be very intense or not at all from place to place. The EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015 spread between the affected countries in West Africa through land borders [16]. This fact should be considered by policy makers for preparedness planning. Countries where many official and unofficial crossing points exist or countries where border checks are not routinely conducted at ground crossings may not be well prepared to respond. Preparedness activities for potential unexpected events should include plans for implementation of screening measures at ground crossings. Screening measures at land borders require cooperation among neighboring countries and regions. However, considering the previously reported challenges and the lack of evidence on the impact of entry screening measures at ground crossings, this area may represent a gap in preparedness in the event of a high risk of exportation/introduction and spread of disease through land borders of neighboring countries.

All these factors should be considered to estimate the possible expected detection rates, and to balance this with other measures that could be implemented, and the cost and effectiveness of those.

It showed that \u201cfor pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics.

The report continues that NCITs are more accurate than the thermal scanner cameras. The US CDC evaluated the performance of NCITs, showing a sensitivity of 80\u201399% and a specificity of 75\u201399%.

Databases searched index health-related publications; it is possible that additional publications exist related to cost-effectiveness of screening measures. Language bias could be one limitation of the review, since only articles in English, Dutch, German, and Greek were included in the review. In total, four articles were excluded due to language.

Exit screening measures could be prioritized compared to entry measures, based on past temporary recommendations issued during PHEIC. Evidence from this review suggests that entry screening measures alone are not effective in detecting imported cases at borders, but may allow opportunities for raising awareness and educating the traveling public. The current review further suggests that there are difficulties in assessing the impact of border screening measures. Statistical data demonstrate very low detection rates of cases in both entry and exit screening. The decision about the implementation of screening measures should be examined on a case-by-case basis, after considering the disease and outbreak characteristics, the country situation, and the available resources, which can be compared to the cost and effectiveness of other alternative measures. Screening measures have important concomitant effects when implemented in combination with health education and informative strategies for travelers, the decision-making process should take those effects into consideration. Specificities at each type of point of entry (port, airport, ground crossing) should be considered for the implementation of screening measures, since different approaches are needed for each type of point of entry. The implementation of entry and exit screening measures require planning, allocation of resources, and careful design and application of protocols. Decision-makers should be aware and consider the limitations of screening methods, including false declarations by passengers about exposure and disease signs and symptoms, use of antipyretic drugs to conceal fever by travelers, inability to detect incubating or asymptomatic travelers, language barriers, and false positive and false negative results expected from temperature measuring devices. Based on review results, an algorithm about decision-making for entry/exit screening was developed. Guidance and advice on decision-making related to entry and exit screening measures from international organizations would be helpful to countries when developing their preparedness plans, as well as when deciding about response measures to public health events. Training of staff are among the key issues for implementing a robust screening program at points of entry. ",
