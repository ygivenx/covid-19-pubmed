            "text": "An RNA motif, called stem-loop-2-like motif (s2m), has been identified in the 3\u2032 end of the genomes of viruses belonging to different RNA virus families which infect a broad range of mammal and bird species [1]. So far, s2m has been found in species of the following virus families; Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and Caliciviridae. All avastroviruses identified to date, except Turkey astrovirus 2 (TAstV-2) harbour s2m. In addition, several species among mamastroviruses, with the exception of Bottlenose dolphin astrovirus 1, and the branch comprising, among others, Human astrovirus MLB1, rat astroviruses and a few bat astroviruses [2]\u2013[6], harbour this motif.On the other hand, only few picornaviruses have been identified to date harbouring s2m; viruses in the genus Erbovirus (Equine rhinitis B virus 1 and 2) causing a mild respiratory infection in horses [7], and more recently in viruses in the genus Paraturdivirus, which is proposed as a novel genus in the Picornaviridae family [8]. The viruses in this genus (Turdivirus 2 and 3) are found to infect wild birds in Hong Kong. In the Coronaviridae family, s2m has been found in all members of the genus Gammacoronavirus, that all infect birds, [9], and in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus that consist of SARS coronaviruses from the human outbreak of 2003, and from bats, within the Betacoronavirus genus [10]. In addition, s2m has also been found in Canine norovirus, in two isolates from Italy [11] and one from Portugal [12]. The two noroviruses from Italy are assigned to genogroup IV, subtype 2, while the norovirus from Portugal are still unassigned. Noroviruses belong to the family Caliciviridae, which has a genome organization similar to astrovirus, and are regarded as a major cause of epidemic, nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide in humans at all ages [13]\u2013[15].",

About 75% of the s2m sequence is absolutely invariant between viral species. The nucleotides in the loop region show less variation than the nucleotides in the basal stem, but stem nucleotide differences are almost always compensated by covariations to maintain base pairing [16]. Because RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, this suggests that s2m has a very important function in the viruses carrying it.",

Comparison of the global fold of the SARS s2m RNA to known RNA tertiary structures revealed that the backbone fold of the s2m RNA has a structure corresponding to the 530 loop of 16S rRNA. This loop in 16S rRNA, and proteins that bind to it, are known to be involved in translation initiation. It has been proposed that s2m might bind to one or more factors in the host's translational machinery, which is necessary for initiation of the protein synthesis, even if the structure homology is identified towards prokaryotic rather than eukaryotic rRNA. The virus could thus hijack this machinery for its own purpose. In addition it is possible that the Nsp9 protein in SARS coronavirus can bind to s2m, and thereby facilitate viral polymerase RNA transcription, translation or replication. Hence, s2m can be important for both the protein synthesis and the replication.",

            "text": "The high degree of similarity between s2m from non-related virus families indicates that s2m has a common origin. It is unlikely that s2m has coevolved with the rest of the genome of a single common ancestor virus, because this motif is present only in a limited number of viral species within the viral families where it has been found and because of the large evolutionary distance between them. This suggests that s2m has been transferred between different RNA virus by non-homologous recombination. A relatively high frequency of recombination is observed within species of coronavirus and picornavirus [18]\u2013[21], both in cell culture and in nature. Recombination has also been demonstrated to occur within astroviruses [3], [22]\u2013[24]. RNA recombination enables the exchange of genetic material not only between the same or similar viruses, but also between distinctly different viruses. However, this seems very rare as it depends on coinfection of a single cell by two non-related viruses, and in contrast to recombination within viral species, transfer from one virus family to another cannot involve a homologous recombination mechanism [18], [25], [26].",

Thus s2m must have conferred some immediate advantage to the virus upon acquisition, thus spreading faster than viruses not harbouring the motif. In the Astroviridae family, however, it seems that the motif has been lost in TAstV-2, since this is the only species among avastroviruses not harbouring s2m. The presence of s2m in several, but not all, branches of mamastrovirus could either be due to the motif being lost in several branches, or to be acquired independently in different lines of mamastroviruses.",

Since s2m is such an extremely conserved motif, it is an ideal target for identification of the viruses harbouring it. We have earlier described a reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis which should be able to detect all viruses with poly(A)-tailed, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome that contains s2m [9]. As s2m seems to be functional in many different viruses, it is plausible that there exist more viruses that contain s2m than those that have been found so far, and the aim of this study was to identify and characterize s2m harbouring viruses in a bird population.",

In contrast, in other species such as dogs or cats, the detection of astrovirus appears very sporadic [52], but astrovirus is often isolated together with other enteric pathogens, both in animals and in humans [53]. In mammals, astrovirus causes gastroenteritis, while in birds, astroviruses are associated with a broader spectrum of diseases, such as enteritis, hepatitis and nephritis. We were not able to detect any correlation between the presence of astrovirus and illness in the birds.",

In the novel pigeon astroviruses, s2m was located entirely within the 3\u2032 UTR (Figure 5), similarly to the location of s2m in all avastroviruses, except for Duck astrovirus (DAstV), where s2m is partially located in the capsid region and partially in the 3\u2032 UTR, as in mamastrorviruses. S2m in picorna- and coronaviruses is located entirely within the 3\u2032 UTR, while s2m in norovirus is located partially in the minor capsid complex (ORF3) and partially in the 3\u2032 UTR. The invariant positioning of s2m close to the 3\u2032 end of the positive RNA strand may suggest that its function is connected to the replication or the stability of the viral RNA molecule. The wide range of viruses harbouring s2m suggests that its function is not by interaction with virus proteins. Even considering the wide range of host cell types, it might have a function based on interaction with conserved cellular biomolecules. The viruses harbouring s2m have different strategies for translation initiation, but a role of s2m in viral RNA translation through binding to one or more proteins possessing an oligomer-binding-like fold has been proposed based on tertiary structural comparisons [17]. Three lines of evidence suggest that a mechanism for facilitation of its horizontal transfer is imbedded in the structure itself: 1) the relative high number of recombination or excision events necessary to explain its distribution among virus groups, 2) the wide range of RNA primary and secondary structures surrounding the motif and 3) that the excision or insertion of s2m seem to be restricted to the structure without surrounding sequences.",

The novel picornaviruses were all found in the cloacal swabs of the sampled animals. The high prevalence of viruses harbouring s2m and multiple RNA viruses in cloacal swabs from pigeons suggested a favourable condition for recombination between unrelated viruses, and one of the pigeons was actually simultaneously shedding 3 different s2m-harbouring viruses (corona-, picorna- and astrovirus).",
