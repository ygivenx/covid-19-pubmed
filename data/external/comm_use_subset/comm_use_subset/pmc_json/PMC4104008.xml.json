However, in the past few years, it is also being used to harbor cruise vessels and has shown a rising trend in the number of arriving travelers. In addition, a new travel center is currently being constructed. It is noted that, to upgrade competencies and promote the development of the TIA and PoK, during 2010\u20132012, the responsibility of operation and management of both the PoEs was shifted from the government authority to the state-run corporations. Since then, these state-run corporations have been responsible for the coordination and consolidation of various agencies stationed in the designated PoEs, under the supervision of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) of the central government.",

Originally, it was perceived that the TCDC shall serve this role. However, when the core capacity requirements were examined in detail, it was realized that some of the health measures mentioned in IHR 2005 were being conducted by other government authorities in reality. For example, if an ill traveler with symptoms of a possible communicable disease was reported in the PoK, the TCDC will be responsible for the assessment of the traveler. If the TCDC decided to refer the traveler to a hospital for further diagnosis and treatment, the PoK fire brigade would be responsible for transporting the traveler to the hospital (with their trained personnel and equipment). Thus, in order to cater to the practical situation in Taiwan, it was consensually decided that the competent authority shall vary according to the different health measures.",

Therefore, it is believed that while developing the PoE core capacities, it would be more efficient if any important consensus and resource integration can be achieved in advance, at the central level, especially in terms of jurisdiction clarification and financial support. Furthermore, problems that universally exist among various PoEs are often related to issues in general structure, which can never be resolved by the individual PoEs alone. In this case, problem solving must highly rely on the mobilization of resources/support from the central government to the PoEs. For example, initially, both TIA and PoK felt that they lacked the expertise/capability to cope with radiological events, or plan their response to them because the central Atomic Energy Council commissioned no affiliated units at the PoEs. Consequently, the council dispatched experts directly to the TIA and PoK, to assist them in formulating radiological emergency planning, and provided necessary training for the early detection, operation of equipment, and approach to seek external support from the national radiological response team.",

Following this, members were asked to report their field activities concerning the IHR core capacities. In addition, a field visit was arranged for, if necessary. For instance, the TIA taskforce visited the airport cargo terminal services to understand the operation of the transportation of dangerous goods according to International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations. Finally, members worked together to complete the WHO assessment tool, by describing any measures, facilities, and approaches available at the PoE, and listed documents which can provide evidence on the compliance of the core capacity requirements.

In addition, two areas of consideration were proposed in the further implementation of the core capacities. First, as the detection of fever-screening limits for respiratory diseases was an area of concern, broader surveillance parameters may be considered to enable the detection of non-respiratory diseases. Second, it was suggested that a risk assessment may be implemented to determine whether vector control measures are warranted, and whether a response protocol should be established to mitigate the risk of introduction of vectors detected in an aircraft. In response to the reviewers\u2019 recommendations, the TCDC, as the competent authority for these matters, are carrying out policy analysis of current entry screening procedures, as well as the vector surveillance/control on aircrafts (Table 1).",

Further, due to the lack of international guidance, it seemed easier and less complicated to restrict the assessments to communicable diseases. However, it was subsequently determined that Taiwan should not ignore radiological and chemical hazards because the type of accidents that may occur at the PoEs cannot be predicted or selected. Sometimes, an accidental or deliberate release of chemical, biological, and radiological agents on arriving conveyances would have the potential to cause adverse health and financial consequences (18). In this case, imported risks cannot be identified, nor be properly dealt with, without the relevant surveillance and response capacities. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 highlighted the need to involve diversified public health risks in Taiwan. Since then, more than 200 containers imported from Japan have been detected as being contaminated in the PoK. In this case, once possible potential nuclear hazard was detected, the custom authority, authorized to undertake radiological inspections, will implement a series of SOPs including risk identification/evaluation, reporting, PPEs for staff, etc.",

In addition, as the success of any response is highly linked to the people who perform their roles, the required competencies and skills needed for specific response personnel were identified, and relevant training programs were designed. Regular drill exercises were conducted to verify the adequacy and interoperability of the plans, as well as to increase the stakeholders\u2019 familiarity with their responsibilities and operational procedures. Through the abovementioned efforts, the reviewers of the follow-up assessment noted a significant progress in establishing emergency response SOPs, as well as ensuring that resources were available to ensure rapid responses. From these experiences, it was learned that despite a lack of international principles and guidance for establishing core capacities, countries should try to take its own decisions on what to do and how to do it, based on its current infrastructure, and resources and demands. In addition, where possible, countries should build on existing systems and infrastructure for strengthening their capacities, rather than immediately investing in large-scale systems or infrastructure changes.",

Therefore, the TCDC invested considerable effort in advocating the aim and concepts of the IHR 2005. Despite these efforts, the IHR PoE program was not implemented very smoothly, due to the resistance and complaints from the field, until the Japan Fukushima nuclear disaster occurred in 2011. Fearing the impact of nuclear contaminations (as traffic and trade are very frequent between Japan and Taiwan), people working at the PoEs were keenly aware of the importance of protecting themselves by enhancing the surveillance and response system. They found a self-motivated actor (21) to participate in developing the PoE's core capacities, and gradually realized that they were jointly contributing to something beneficial for their own workplace, safety, and health. This change of attitude was helpful for further activities. Subsequently, to protect themselves, these stakeholders were willing to think about and invest more efforts in developing capacities to address the emergency response. For instance, people were very concerned if they were to be notified about anything unusual. Therefore, they carefully reviewed and updated the contact details of every stakeholder to ensure that event information can be disseminated immediately.",
