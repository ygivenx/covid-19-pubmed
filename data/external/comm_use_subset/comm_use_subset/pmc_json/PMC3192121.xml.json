In most cases each genome segment encodes a single protein from a single open reading frame (ORF), expect segment 9 (Seg-9) and segment 10 (Seg-10), both of which encode two nearly identical proteins initiated from in-phase AUG codons close together near the upstream termini (VP6 and VP6a encoded by Seg-9, and NS3 and NS3a encoded by Seg-10) [2], [5]. However, in vitro translation of BTV RNA segments reproducibly generated a number of smaller translation products of unknown significance, that were usually dismissed as unimportant by-products of translation [2].",

VP1, VP4 and VP6 are minor enzymatic proteins that are packaged along with the ten genome segments within the central space of the virus core [6], [7]. The orbivirus outer-capsid layer is composed of two additional structural proteins (VP2 and VP5 of BTV), which mediate cell-attachment and penetration during initiation of infection. These outer-capsid proteins are more variable than the core proteins and most of the non-structural proteins, and the specificity of their reactions with neutralising antibodies determines the virus serotype (as exemplified by VP2 of BTV [8]). The relative number and locations of the BTV structural proteins have been determined in biochemical and structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography [7], [9], [10], [11], [12].",

BTV NS2 can be phosphorylated by ubiquitous cellular kinases and is an important matrix protein of the granular viral inclusion bodies (VIB) that form within the cytoplasm of infected cells. VIB represent the primary site of virus replication and assembly. The smallest of the BTV non-structural proteins that were previously identified, are membrane glycoproteins NS3 and NS3a, which are expressed in large amounts in insect cells, but not in mammalian cells. They are involved in the release of progeny virus particles from infected cells [15]. In some orbiviruses (e.g. AHSV) NS3/NS3a are highly variable and it has been suggested that they may be involved in determination of both vector competence and virulence [16].",

For this procedure, alignment columns in which the reference sequence (GenBank accession number: NC_006008) contained gap characters were removed so that the plots are in reference sequence coordinates.",

Highest identity was detected between BTV and EHDV (50%), followed by PHSV and YUOV-1 (30%). Amino acid identity in NS4 between the tick-borne and insect-borne viruses, ranged between 5% to 18% (table 2). Local blast analyses using BLAST-P or TBLAST-N identified significant matches (as defined by the E value in BLAST) between NS4 proteins encoded by other orbiviruses. Analysis of NS4 protein sequences using the pfam program, which uses the hidden Markov model (HMM) based profiles to identify or predict protein functionalities [31], [32], revealed strong similarities to certain conserved functional motifs. AHSV NS4 exhibits strong relatedness over almost its entire length with DUF domains that have helical structures known to be involved in nucleic acid binding and/or modification [33]. Previous analysis of GIV NS4 identified a 72 amino acid fragment (aa 82 to 153) with 39% similarity to dsRNA-binding domains of similar length (approximately 68aa) in other reovirus proteins [ [18] or other dsRNA binding proteins [34]. BTV NS4 (77aa long) also exhibits relatedness (over aa 14\u201354) to a DUF domain, belonging to the MetJ/Arc repressor superfamily [35], which has a ribbon-ribbon-helix-helix DNA-binding motif, with the beta-ribbon located in and recognising the major groove of operator DNA.",

However, in line with previous orbivirus protein nomenclature, we have renamed these proteins, based on their theoretical size and absence from the virion, as non-structural protein 4 (NS4). GIV NS4 was previously shown to contain significant aa sequence matches with dsRNA-binding domains [18]. Further analyses of their amino acid sequences indicate that NS4 may be structured as \u2018coiled-coils\u2019 and that BTV NS4 exhibits significant relatedness (as identified by the pfam programme) with nucleic acid binding proteins that also have coiled-coils or helical structures and are associated with ER or cell membranes.",

Although hydrophobicity profiles of putative NS4 proteins from BTV, AHSV, PHSV, YUOV and GIV as analysed using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm [22] are somewhat variable, overall they show broadly similar patterns of conserved domains, indicating that the NS4 proteins are generally hydrophilic (figure 24).",

This conformation allows DRBPs to bind non-specifically to dsRNAs. Indeed, the lack of nucleotide binding recognition suggests that target specificity may generally be governed through interactions with other proteins, since many DRBPs bind strongly but non-specifically to any dsRNA structure in vitro. GIV NS4 can protect dsRNA from degradation by RNAse III endoribonucleases, confirming previous sequence analyses indicating the presence of a dsRNA-binding domains [18]. BTV NS4 which is half the theoretical size of its counterpart in GIV, lacks dsRNA binding domains and did not protect dsRNA from Dicer or RNAse III. NS4 of GIV and BTV both failed to protect ssRNA or ssDNA from degradation by RNAse A, or nuclease S1 respectively (data not shown). However, NS4 of both GIV and BTV did protect dsDNA from degradation by DNAse I, indicating an ability to bind dsDNA.",

Previous work showed that intracellular expression of an NS1 specific antibody fragment (scFv) destabilised the formation of NS1 tubules in BTV infected cells [14]. As a consequence, cells became persistently infected and viruses exited by budding instead of via cell lysis. Although BTV NS3 is effectively expressed in insect cells [15], it is much less abundant in mammalian cells [4]. It was suggested previously [14] that the relative levels of NS1 to NS3 synthesised during infection dictate the fate of cellular pathogenesis as of whether the virus exit occurs by lysis or budding.",
