Among these, CAV-2, CDV or CPIV have frequently been detected in dogs with CIRD, according to previous studies [5, 6]. Avian-origin H3N2 CIV has been detected in domestic dogs in South Korea and China since 2007 [7, 8]. H3N2 CIV is now circulating in dog populations in China, South Korea, Thailand, and even the United States [9\u201311].

            "text": "Canine viral enteritis is common in dogs with acute vomiting and diarrhea [12]. Canine parvovirus (CPV) is one of the major viruses leading to acute gastroenteritis in dogs; CPV infection is characterized by fever, severe diarrhea and vomiting, with high morbidity [13]. Puppies tend to be intolerant of CPV infection and have higher mortality than adult dogs because of myocarditis and dehydration [14, 15]. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is characterized by high morbidity and low mortality. Dogs infected with CCoV alone are likely to have mild diarrhea, whereas the disease may be fatal when coinfection by CCoV and CPV, CDV or canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1) occurs [16, 17]. CAV-2 is associated with mild respiratory infection and episodic enteritis [18, 19]. Canine circovirus (CanineCV), a newly discovered mammalian circovirus, was first reported by Kapoor et al. in 2012 [20]. CanineCV has been detected in dogs with severe hemorrhagic diarrhea, and it is more common in puppies than in adults [21, 22]. Coinfection of CanineCV with other intestinal pathogens (CPV or CCoV) is closely related to the occurrence of intestinal diseases [23, 24]. Dogs with intestinal diseases are often infected with one or more viruses, and their clinical symptoms are similar [17, 25, 26], making clinical differential diagnosis difficult. To date, no multiplex PCR (mPCR) method has been developed to detect CanineCV and other enteropathogens.",

Although many methods exist to detect CIRD and canine viral enteritis, most can detect only 2 or 3 pathogens, and the current lack of systematic and comprehensive detection methods makes diagnosis impractical and time consuming [4, 27, 28]. Because mPCR can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a timely and inexpensive manner, this technique has become increasingly popular [29]. Therefore, in this study, two new mPCR methods were developed for the detection of canine respiratory viruses (CRV, including CAV-2, CDV, CIV and CPIV) and canine enteric viruses (CEV, including CAV-2, CanineCV, CCoV and CPV), and we indicated that the mPCR methods established here are simple and effective tools for detecting the viruses of interest.",

Primers for the detection of CAV-2 were designed by reference to previous studies with some modification [32]. All primers used for mPCRs were required to have similar annealing temperatures, lack dimmers or hairpin structures, and used degenerate bases as little as possible to avoid mismatches.

Dog infectious diseases mainly include respiratory and intestinal viral diseases, including CRV (CAV-2, CDV, CIV and CPIV) and CEV (CAV-2, CanineCV, CCoV and CPV). However, the traditional methods of virus identification and isolation are time consuming, causing delays in treatment initiation. A few methods for detecting virus-induced respiratory or enteric disease have been developed [4, 27, 28, 34], but no previous study had developed a systematic way to detect both CRV and CEV in dogs. Here, we developed two mPCR methods for detection of the most frequently coinfected viruses; these methods could be performed to diagnose dogs according to their clinical symptoms.",

The ratio of positive samples to total samples was 80% (16/20) for CRV detection and 85% (17/20) for CEV detection. Because the sample number was insufficient, these results were not statistically significant. However, CPV and CDV clearly remain two of the more serious and epidemic diseases in dogs in worldwide at present [35\u201338]. Epidemiological monitoring of CPV is particularly important because CPV evolves at a rapid rate, similar to that of Porcine Circovirus 3 [39, 40]. Because a small number of dogs were negative for the viruses tested by the CRV or CEV detection assays, although they suffered respiratory illness or intestinal problems, we suggest that some viruses with low prevalence and pathogenic bacteria may also cause disease in dogs [2, 41]. A variety of pathogenic bacteria are often present along with viruses in canine infections [42, 43], and thus, it is essential to expand the coverage of mPCR detection in the future. For example, CIRD also include CHV-1, canine reovirus, and Bordetella bronchiseptica and so on. At the same time, other pathogens causing serious zoonotic diseases, such as pseudorabies virus, should also be monitored in future [44, 45].",

Though the pathogenic mechanism of CanineCV is unclear, epidemiological testing is important for future research. CanineCV was not detected from the AS clinical samples; perhaps the limited source of these clinical samples was responsible for this result. We didn\u2019t get a lot of clinical samples because it was not easy to get disease samples. CAV-2 mostly replicates in the lower respiratory tract and was detected in the NS samples [2]; however, the CAV-2 primer pair used in this study was probably able to amplify the CAV-1 DNA virus despite the optimization performed [32]. Notably, the live vaccine strains used may have an unavoidable impact on disease detection using the methods developed in this study. Additionally, discriminating between wild-type infections and vaccines is important [34], and therefore, a trend exists toward later development of broad-spectrum and accurate mPCR detection methods. Sometimes, cross contamination may lead to experimental failure. It is worth noting that PCR pretreatment and post-treatmen performed in different isolation zones can effectively avoid pollution. Besides, regular air spray cleaning will also play a role.",

Here, detection of CanineCV was added to mPCR for the first time, making this method suitable for the further study of coinfection by CanineCV and other pathogens.
