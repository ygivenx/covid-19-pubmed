            "text": "Microarray technology was invented to rapidly profile the quantities of mRNA transcripts in a particular cellular context [1-3]. Its application has become universal in biomedical researches. Although it is mRNA that is actually detected by microarray experiments, and it is mRNA that has the direct relationship with protein, the methodology and algorithms for data analysis are commonly gene based. As evident in the probe annotation file provided by Affymetrix, gene-level annotation is widely accepted even though it fails to discriminate multiple mRNAs transcribed from the same gene. As a result, the analysis results are usually summarized at the gene level, such as differentially expressed genes [4-6] or gene-sets [7,8]. Even in the recent works that integrate protein-protein interaction data and microarray data [9-11], the analysis unit is reduced to the gene instead of mRNA. This practice could be attributed to the fact that most of the functional knowledge is at gene level instead of transcript level, and the functional differences between mRNA variants transcribed from the same gene are seldom clear. Although the gene-level analysis ignores the difference among mRNAs variants, this strategy is still biologically meaningful considering that the diversity of genes is much higher than that of transcripts encoded by the same gene.",

In addition, other RNA processing events, such as RNA editing, also account for the increased diversity at the mRNA level [13]. Since these events enable one gene to encode multiple proteins which might be functionally heterogeneous, we feel it necessary to separate transcript-level synonymous probesets from gene-level synonymous ones. The probesets that hybridize to more than one transcript variant of the same gene are referred to as gene-level synonymous probesets; while the ones that hybridize to a single variant are named as transcript-level synonymous probesets. It has been noticed that transcript-level synonymous probesets tend to have similar expression profiles, while gene-level synonymous probesets may have distinct expression profiles [14,15]. In fact, individual reports demonstrated that the expression of transcript variants could be totally different [16,17]. These phenomena indicate that the gene-level strategy of microarray data analysis is imprecise enough that one may overlook the expressional inconsistencies among gene-level synonymous probesets.",

For example, probesets that recognize unique transcript variants are suffixed with _at, and probesets that recognize multiple alternative transcripts from a single gene are suffixed with _a_at or _s_at, and so on. This suffix system gives a hint on the varied specificities of the probesets, and could be considered as an endeavor trying to do away with customers' worry about the gene-level data analysis strategy. However, the correctness of the suffix system has been in doubt [14,18]. Therefore it is not reliable to perform transcript-level analysis on the basis of this imperfect suffix system. As the standard annotation files and most of the analysis algorithms are gene-oriented, analysts often average out the expression heterogeneity of the same gene when dealing with probeset level data [19].",

These annotations discriminate alternative mRNA variants transcribed from a same gene, thus are at transcript level as opposed to the standard gene-level annotation files provided by Affymetrix. It is worth noting that since the transcript data we used were quite redundant, a conceptual transcript variant may be represented by multiple redundant transcript accessions in the transcript database.

In our annotation table, a one-to-one probeset was linked to only a single protein, while a one-to-many probeset was linked to multiple proteins due to alternative splicing of one gene. The rest of the investigated probesets that were not linked to any protein were categorized into the third group of \u201cone-to-null\u201d. The statistics of these three groups are shown in Table 2. As we know, Affymetrix suffixes their probeset ID according to the probeset's specificity. The over ten types of probeset suffixes can be categorized into three groups: transcript-specific, with '_at', gene-specific, with '_a_at' or '_s_at', and other suboptimal probesets that may cross-hybridize with unrelated sequences. The first two groups are comparable to our one-to-one and one-to-many probesets respectively. However, we found that, out of a total of 21,097 and 16,213 investigated probesets in MOE430A_2 and HG-U133A respectively (Table 1), our one-to-one type accounts for only 53.7% and 43.3%, which were significantly lower than that of _at probesets, 74.0% and 72.6%, in the respective arrays.

For example, the Affymetrix _at group has 30.1% one-to-many probesets and 11.7% one-to-null probesets, suggesting that these so-called 'transcript-specific' probesets do not have the expected high specificity, and that they should be treated with caution in data analysis. On the other hand, the Affymetrix _a_at/_s_at group contains 42.0% one-to-one probesets. We attributed this mainly to the trimming of the originally false transcripts during the update of sequence information, as they may lead to the absence of the transcript targets of some probesets. Similarly, there are a large number of one-to-one probesets in the so-called Affy others group, 1,206 out of 2,619 for MOE430A_2 and 476 out of 1,555 for HG-U133A. These probesets, however, might not be really one-to-one mapping to the identified transcript targets, as our strategy was based on the premise that most probesets were specific for certain genes, and our blast was limited to the candidate transcripts associated with the probesets, but not the entire transcript pool.",

Since transcript-level synonymous probesets in our work recognized a single protein-coding transcript variant identified with a unique IPI ID, transcript-level synonymous probesets were also named as protein-level synonymous ones. Practically, we grouped gene-level synonymous probesets according to gene ID, and protein-level ones according to IPI ID. The probeset-protein mapping tables provided at NetAffx, the official protein-level annotation of Affymetrix probesets [26], was used as comparison. Probesets corresponding to a single protein according to NetAffx were designated as 'Affy-protein' level synonymous probesets, which was a third level of synonymy. Within each synonymous group, all pair-wise PCCs were calculated and then summarized to one value indicating the expression correlation of this group. The expression correlations of all synonymous groups at one level were then averaged into an overall value for a dataset (see Method section for details). The correlations of synonymous groups for 30 datasets at three different levels were depicted in parallel in Figure 1A. It is noticeable that the synonymous probesets at Affy-protein level show higher correlations than those at gene level, but the synonymous ones based on our protein level annotation show even higher correlations consistently over 30 datasets (p < 0.05 for 30 datasets under student's t-test, see Additional file 2 for details).

The inferiority of the Affy-protein level annotation to our annotation could be attributed to the technical details in their alignment and association procedures [26]. First, they used the representative mRNA sequence ('consensus' or 'exemplar' sequence of each probeset), instead of the probe sequences themselves, as the query sequence in the alignment. Second, they aligned against the GenBank non-redundant protein database, rather than a comprehensive pool of mRNA sequences. In microarray experiment hybridization takes place between the probe sequences immobilized on the array and the cDNA sequences from the sample, so one can deduce that the alignment between the representative mRNA sequences and the protein sequences cannot precisely simulate the hybridization between probes and mRNAs. Finally, NetAffx filtered the blast results according to a cutoff of E-value, which indicates the likelihood of the observed alignment by chance [27]. Although frequently adopted for sequence homology analysis in closely related species, E-value is not sensitive enough to grade the many well aligned targets from the same species. In our practice, we took the probe sequences as the query and the mRNA sequences as the alignment targets, and adopted the matching nucleotide proportion as the filtering criterion (see Methods).",

As our work was done two years later than Harbig et al.'s, the updated mRNA sequences in the probe-mRNA alignment is one of factors contributing to the increased performance. The other contributing factor is different approach we used to identify the mapping of probes to mRNA targets. Harbig et al. performed a two-phase blast: first, blast probeset target sequences against mRNA sequence pool, and then blast probe sequences against the retrieved mRNA sequences. Efficient as it was, this two-phase-blast strategy reduced the alignment precision as compared to our direct probe-against-mRNA blast strategy. Moreover, Harbig et al. accepted the mRNA with the highest average probe matches as the target of a probeset, even if the highest value could be suboptimal.",

Such genes are likely to involve alternative transcript variants which are constitutively different in expression levels. We looked at two genes as examples. Shown in Figure 2A, three probesets in GDS1277 dataset, 1448556_at, 1421382_at and 1451844_at, were mapped to the mouse Prlr gene (GeneID: 19116), with the first probeset correlating to protein IPI00321091, or PRL-R3, and the other two correlating to protein IPI00408593, or PRL-R2. The Prlr gene was reported to encode at least seven isoforms of prolactin receptor precursor in mouse [16]. The two probesets corresponding to the same protein IPI00408593, showed similar expression profiles as expected, with a PCC value of 0.6738 (P = 4.57e-6); while the probeset corresponding to another isoform, IPI00321091, showed a significantly different expression profile, with PCCs of 0.2530 and -0.0331 separately for 1421382_at and 1451844_at (Figure 2A). These data were consistent with the previous report that these two isoforms were predominantly expressed in liver and kidney, where PRL-R3 was highly expressed and PRL-R2 was weakly expressed [16]. We noticed that the shape of the expression curve of PRL-R3 seemed to be somewhat comparable to those of PRL-R2, although PRL-R3 probeset presented an overall higher expression level. These phenomena may suggest that PRL-R3 and PRL-R2 are partially co-regulated so that they show a comparable expression pattern, but they are expressed at different levels probably due to diverse roles of the regulatory elements.",

Both proteins were indicated in IPI as homologs of yeast asparagine-linked glycosylation 14 without any further information. We notice two interesting phenomena in this case. First, the two probesets correlating to a same protein do not show similar expression profiles. Instead, they behave like the probesets correlating to different variants characterized by a PCC value of 0.4080 (P = 0.0415). This issue might be due to some factors causing microarray hybridization efficiency shift. Secondly, according to our calculation, the expressions of these two variants are negatively correlated with PCC values of -0.7740 (P = 5.04e-5) for 1419116_at and 1419115_at, and -0.4402 (P = 0.0296) for 1419116_at and 1419114_at. So far there are no reports on expression regulation of these two transcript variants of gene Alg14, and no function reports of the corresponding protein isoforms. This negative correlation suggested that these two proteins might perform different roles thus should be distinctly annotated.",

All these works assumed that interacting protein pairs were characterized with higher expression correlation than random ones.

That is, the analysis targets were expanded from real interacting protein pairs to all possible cross-gene protein pairs for which interaction may not always exist. As illustrated in Figure 3, suppose we have gene a (abbreviated to Ga) and gene b (Gb), with Ga encoding protein a1 (Pa1) and protein a2 (Pa2), Gb encoding protein b1 (Pb1) and protein b2 (Pb2). Among these protein variants, only proteins Pa2 and Pb1 interact with each other, while the other three possible cross-gene interactions, including Pa1-Pb1, Pa1-Pb2 and Pa2-Pb2, do not really happen. The four probesets, Pst_a1, Pst_a2, Pst_b1, and Pst_b2, recognize transcript variants Ta1, Ta2, Tb1 and Tb2 respectively, producing proteins Pa1, Pa2, Pb1 and Pb2. In the conventional genome-scale studies mentioned above, besides the probeset pair (Pst_a2, Pst_b1) corresponding to the real interacting protein pair, the other three cross-gene pairs, (Pst_a1, Pst_b1), (Pst_a1, Pst_b2) and (Pst_a2, Pst_b2), were also included, which would blunt the expression correlation between the real interacting entities according to our preceding observations.

As depicted in Figure 3, the probeset pairs corresponding to all possible cross-gene protein pairs are termed as GGI pairs, out of which only the probeset pair corresponding to the real PPI, such as Pst_a2-Pst_b1, is a PPI pair.

Taking the GDS987 dataset including 41 arrays as an example (Figure 4A and Additional file 3), while it is difficult to tell the distribution of GGI PCC values from that of the random ones, the PPI PCC values exhibit a distinguishable distribution biased to larger absolute correlation values. We compared the distributions for positive correlations and negative correlations separately. Out of the 1037 interactions, 575 PPI PCC values were positive with a mean value of 0.2924, which was significantly larger than the mean of the 574 positive GGI PCC values, 0.2387 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p value is 8.2E-8); On the other hand, the mean values of the other 462 negative PPI PCC values and the 463 negative GGI PCC values were -0.2263 and -0.153, respectively, and the former was significantly smaller than the latter (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p value is 9.9E-12). Summarizing the comparisons at the positive side and the negative side, we conclude that the expression correlation between interacting proteins is strengthened when the non-interacting protein pairs are excluded from the interacting gene pairs, that is, with the PPI PCC calculation in place of the conventional GGI PCC calculation.",

That is to say, PPI pairs seem to be either positively correlated or negatively correlated, but not exclusively 'co-expressed' as previous publications reported [10]. This phenomenon is more evident when we examine the PCC values for each coupled PPI pair and GGI pair. Figure 4B shows a scatter plot of the PPI PCC values versus the corresponding GGI PCC values. It is evident that most points fall into the 1st and the 3rd quadrants, indicating that each pair of PPI PCC value and GGI PCC value tends to have the same signs. The scatter plot suggests a linear relationship between the PPI PCCs and GGI PCCs, and indeed we get a linear regression formula, y = 0.5612x + 0.0046, at high confidence (p < 2e-16). Since the estimated coefficient, 0.5612, is far less than 1, we may conclude that the absolute PCC values of PPI pairs are often larger than those of the corresponding GGI pairs. So the PPI PCC calculation preserves the original positive or negative correlation tendency revealed by the conventional GGI PCC calculation, and strengthens it with larger absolute correlation values. Such correlation tendencies between interacting proteins, especially those negative ones, would very likely be submerged under the background correlations of random pairs if the non-interacting protein pairs are included in the analysis.",

A few research groups performed probe-against-mRNA blast similar to ours [22,42,44], but mostly they centered around UniGene [45] and therefore improved the accuracy of annotation only at gene level. A major trend among these efforts was to redefine probesets so that probes matching the same molecular target were placed into custom probesets, as proposed by [19,23,39,42], but as the authors of [19] pointed out, 'these transcript-targeted probesets are not transcript-specific, as probesets targeting transcripts from the same gene may share many or even all probes'. Thus the probe re-organization strategy may be used to make distinction at the level of genes, but not at the level of transcripts or splice variants [18]. Besides, this strategy takes the probe-level intensity file (the CEL file) as a prerequisite, however only around half of the expression datasets deposited in public databases like GEO were found with CEL files.",

We discriminate the intended alternative transcript variants of Affymetrix probesets based on the NetAffx's gene-level annotation for the first time.

            "text": "Over the past few years, the analysis of alternative splicing has emerged as an important new field in bioinformatics, and several recent large-scale studies have shown that alternative splicing can be analyzed in a high-throughput manner using DNA-microarray methods [46,47]. Most of these studies used arrays particularly manufactured for analyzing alternative splicing, such as genomic tiling array and exon-exon junction array. Constructed without any priori knowledge of the possible exon content of a genomic sequence, the genomic tiling array [48,49] is in principle capable of detecting novel alternative splicing events of diverse types, but it is in doubt whether their data will be readily interpretable as successful experiences remain insufficient [46]. On the other hand, although designed particularly to address the alternative splicing issue, exon and exon-exon junction arrays [49] were reported to be plagued by problematic probe specificity and unsatisfying hybridization efficiency because of the necessity of probe coverage across the full length of the gene (including 5' end) [5]. Many questions about the reproducibility of the amplification protocol, the quantitative accuracy, and the data analysis need to be addressed as a prerequisite to reliable quantitative analysis using these splicing arrays [50]. Given the current imperfection of splicing array techniques and inconvenience in deciphering their generated data, it is an economic way to do large-scale investigations of alternative transcribing events with standard gene expression arrays, provided that the recognizing targets of the probes can be rigorously defined at the transcript level. Hu et al. proposed a primitive analysis method to explore alternative splicing with Affymetrix 3' gene expression arrays, though they regretted that only alternative splicing biased toward the 3'end of the gene can be detected in their way [51]. In the present paper, we conducted a large-scale alignment of the probe sequences in traditional gene expression arrays against the currently most comprehensive collection of transcript sequences, highlighting the probesets mapping to unique alternative transcripts unambiguously. For each of the two Affymetrix expression arrays tested in this study, we found over 40% of all probesets could be mapped to transcripts in a one-to-one manner, so our work strongly validate that it is feasible to analyze alternative splicing using traditional gene expression arrays. While the foregoing work contributed by Hu et al. remains as a qualitative analysis method aiming at detecting novel alternative splicing events, our work gives explicitly the relationship between the probesets and the currently known alternative transcript variants, which can be immediately exploited to facilitate quantitative analysis of alternative variants. As our mapping relationships are defined for the standard probesets of the traditional gene expression arrays, they can be conveniently exploited as the standard NetAffx annotation information, without any ad hoc influence on the widely applied experiment protocols or the routine data processing algorithms. In the demonstrative implementations of the novel annotation tables, we actually observed several examples of negatively correlated alternative variants (see Figure 2B for one of them), which will shed light on further studies of expression regulation of alternative transcript variants.",

Although previous works addressed similar issues [14,15,18,19,22,23], we are the first to rigorously link existing Affymetrix probesets to their specific transcript targets and their corresponding proteins. Armed with this new annotation, we re-examined a number of previous studies, 30 datasets for MOE430_2 and 28 datasets for HG-U133A from GEO, and revealed increased expression consistency among synonymous probesets and closer expression correlation among interacting proteins. This transcript-level annotation of Affymetrix probesets allows for a more reliable gene expression data analysis and a more accessible protein-level correlation study.",

The probeset-transcript mapping relationships were obtained based on the gene-mRNA mapping tables from GeneBank, RefSeq and Ensembl. In the process, we only included probesets that were identified with one Entrez Gene ID or one Ensembl gene ID. We ignored the probesets that were associated with multiple entities or no entity in the two gene-centric databases, since their gene-level specificity appears doubtful in the standard annotation file.

IPI is currently the least redundant yet most complete protein database for featured species, with one protein sequence matching each transcript variant. Those probesets of which transcript targets do not have any protein counterparts were also excluded from the following blast validation in order to focus our attention to the transcripts with well-characterized functions at protein level.

For a synonymous group, if the expression values of all probesets in all samples were no larger than the constant median value, the probesets in this group were regarded not moderately expressed, and their expression profiles not informative enough. Therefore, we only kept the synonymous groups with at least one expression value above the constant median value, similar to the filtering procedure used by Tian et al. [62]. For the remaining synonymous groups, Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) were calculated for the expression profiles of each probeset pair. The minimum value of these PCCs was taken as a measurement of the expression coherence of this group. We used the minimum aggregation because the gene level synonymous probesets gave rise to within-protein PCCs (which are theoretically higher) and across-protein PCCs (which are theoretically lower), and the former was identical to the result of the protein-level synonymous group. In such a setting, the maximum did not result in any difference, and the average aggregation was not as sensitive as the minimum in terms of differentiating the two groups, so we adopted the minimum aggregation.",
