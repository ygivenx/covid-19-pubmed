Belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae, influenza virus is an enveloped virus with single-stranded negative-sense RNA consisting of eight segments [1]. Its two major surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [2], are highly expressed during viral infection and serve as targets for immune detection. Thus far, 18 HA (H1\u2013H18) and 11 NA (N1\u2013N11) have been identified [3], and influenza is classified on the basis of the subtypes of HA and NA proteins. Subtype H5 is known as highly pathogenic in poultry [4], while H1N1 is known as a seasonal strain and caused pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu and the 2009 swine flu [5].",

It is initially synthesized as a precursor HA0 protein, which is proteolytically cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits [6]. In the mature HA homotrimer of approximately 220 kDa, HA2 is embedded in the viral membrane, whereas HA1 mediates the binding to the host cell surface [7]. Infection is initiated by binding of HA1 to sialic acid on the membranes of respiratory epithelial cells [8], which makes HA1 a primary target for the development of antiviral agents and diagnostics [9,10]. Thus far, diagnostic methods for the detection of influenza virus infections were mainly based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [11,12], enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [13], and real-time PCR (qPCR) [14].",

Thus far, aptamers have been developed for a wide range of purposes such as biosensors, medical diagnosis, and therapy [16,17]. In order to improve aptamer production, enhanced versions of SELEX were established, such as counter-SELEX, toggle-SELEX, cell-SELEX, and others [18]. Using counter-SELEX methods, the Polisky group created an RNA aptamer that could distinguish between theophylline and caffeine, differing by only one methyl group [19], while the Famulok group made aptamers discriminating between cytohesin-1 and cytohesin-2 [20]. As these and other previous studies indicated, aptamers generated by counter-SELEX can discern minute differences between targets of closely related structures [21,22]. Based on this sensitivity, it can be assumed that aptamers selected by counter-SELEX might be ideal diagnostic tools for differentiating between HA subtypes.",

Enrichment of selected ssDNA aptamers specific for H1-HA1 protein was assessed by ELISA on the basis of the interaction between H1-HA1 protein and biotinylated ssDNA aptamers. A total of 14 cycles of selection were performed, and ssDNA pools isolated after rounds 8, 10, 12, and 14 were tested for binding affinity. As shown in Fig 1B, the absorbance at 450 nm increased significantly from round 10 onwards. After 14 cycles of selection, we obtained 22 independent ssDNA aptamers and measured their binding affinity by ELISA and SPR, as described in Materials and Methods. Binding curves were fitted to a Michaelis-Menten equation (Abs = A[H1-HA1]/(Kd + [H1-HA1], where Abs is the absorbance, A is the amplitude, [H1-HA1] is the concentration of H1-HA1, and Kd is the dissociation constant), and the amplitude and Kd value of each ssDNA aptamer were obtained. Out of 22 candidates, three aptamers, named ApI, ApII, and ApIII, were found to have high binding affinities to H1-HA1, but not to H5-HA1. The Kd values of ApI, ApII, and ApIII were 64.76 \u00b1 18.24 nM, 69.06 \u00b1 12.34 nM, and 50.32 \u00b1 14.07 nM, respectively, as determined from the binding curve (Fig 2A).

Bioinformatic analysis using ClustalW2 (Fig 5B) revealed that the selected aptamers comprise of characteristic clusters of nucleotides in the 45-nucleotide random sequence region (indicated by asterisks) and contain seven nucleotides (GGGTGGG) followed by (G(N)GGGGGTGG), (GGT), and (GGG(N)T(N)G).

Although the exact binding structure is still unclear, the G-rich sequence might be involved in the interaction with H1-HA1. Interestingly, we also found that each aptamer was likely to have two plausible G-quadruplex structures in the 45-nucleotide random sequence region. Therefore, we used QGRS Mapper (representing underlined dots and asterisks in Fig 6A) and circular dichroism to determine whether each aptamer has a G-quadruplex structure. In Fig 6B, a positive peak at 280 nm was obtained with the starting ssDNA library, indicating a normal DNA population [31].

            "text": "Upon influenza virus infection, surface glycoprotein HA recognizes and binds to sialic acid of the host cell membrane, leading to membrane fusion between the virus envelope and the endosome [33]. The identification of the type of HA present on the viral surface could aid in the determination of the species that can be infected and the type of sialic acid that is necessary (Sia\u03b12-6Gal or Sia\u03b12-3Gal) for viral infection [34]. Therefore, an efficient and accurate method to detect the several types of HA is important for the determination of the influenza subtype in infected species. When HA1 sequences of subtypes H1 and H5 were aligned by BLAST, the two proteins were found to have 55% identity and 73% similarity. Therefore, the development of an ssDNA aptamer that can distinguish between H1 and H5 was assumed to be useful for the subtle differentiation between two influenza subtypes. We constructed an ssDNA pool of 88-mers containing a randomized sequence region of 45 nucleotides in the center, which was screened using counter-SELEX in order to isolate ssDNA aptamers binding specifically to H1-HA1 protein, but not to H5-HA1. After 14 cycles of selection, we were able to select three ssDNA aptamers and measure their binding affinities to H1-HA1 by ELISA and SPR. Both methods produced similar results in a range of nanomolar Kd values. In addition to determining Kd values, ELISA and SPR experiments demonstrated that the fixed aptamers on the surface of a plate or chip were able to bind to the H1-HA1 protein. This indicates that appropriate protein-specific ssDNA aptamers would make good probes for the development of biosensors. Further analysis by western blotting demonstrated that the selected aptamers could be used as substitutes for commercial anti-H1-HA1 protein antibodies (S4 Fig). Based on the fact that aptamers are called \u201cchemical antibodies\u201d for their high affinity to target molecules, the isolation of good aptamers should be very attractive for the development of immunological reagents and diagnostic systems [35,36].",

Based on the fact that a characteristic G-rich sequence of nucleotides, (GG(N)xGG) or (GGG(N)xGGG), forms a G-quadruplex structure [37], we predicted those by QGRS Mapper [29,30], because G-rich sequences of the selected aptamers could fold into a G-quadruplex structure [38]. In addition to prediction, the structure of aptamers was analyzed by CD, showing that the selected aptamers have two G-quadruplex structures. According to a previous study, a stable G-quadruplex structure of selected aptamers has a strong binding capacity to a target protein [39]. Therefore, it is likely that a G-quadruplex structure plays an important role in the binding to H1-HA1, although the exact binding mode is still unclear [40].",

            "text": "In fact, there have been several attempts to discover nucleic acid aptamers against HA protein as a target. The Arnon group discovered a DNA aptamer that can prevent viral infection by blocking the receptor-binding region of HA (amino acid 91\u2013261) regardless of the subtype (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2) [41]. Using counter-SELEX, the Kumar group selected an RNA aptamer that can distinguish H3 subtypes (H3N2) of different strains [42], while they recently isolated an aptamer binding to H5N1 and H7N7 viruses and inhibiting HA-glycan interactions [43]. The Kim group isolated RNA aptamers that bind to H5-HA1 (H5N2) and suppress viral infection [44,45]. In most previous studies, the isolated aptamers were binding to the receptor-binding region of HA proteins. To determine whether our selected aptamers were also binding to the receptor-binding region of HA, thereby inhibiting the interaction with the receptor of the host cell, flow cytometry analysis was performed. Interestingly, our selected aptamers did not block the interaction between H1-HA1 protein and the receptor of the host cell, indicating that the aptamers bind to H1-HA1 in a region other than the receptor-binding region. Therefore, our selected aptamers are not expected to inhibit HA-mediated membrane fusion.",
