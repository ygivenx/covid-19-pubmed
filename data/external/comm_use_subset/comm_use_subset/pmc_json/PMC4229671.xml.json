Similarly, there was also a significant increase in Ang II levels in the lungs of Hb01/H7N9 virus-infected mice (Figure 1C). It was noticeable that ACE2 protein expression was downregulated in WT mice following influenza A (H7N9) virus infection.

Six patients who were PCR-positive for the 2013 influenza A (H7N9) virus were recruited from Beijing Chaoyang hospital and Quanzhou hospital, China. The characteristics underlying the conditions and the outcomes of the six patients are described in Supplementary Table S1. A significant increase in plasma Ang II levels was observed in influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients (Figure 1D). In addition, plasma Ang II levels were measured in influenza A (H7N9)-infected patients at different time-points post-infection, and data revealed that Ang II concentrations increased continuously increased from ~350 to 6100 pg/mL; the peak levels were detected when the patient was on the verge of death (Figure S1A). The kinetics of Ang II expression was also quantified in patients who recovered from H7N9 infection (Figure S1B; Table S2 and S3). Data revealed that plasma Ang II levels decreased sharply from the early to the late phase of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in the recovered population. Therefore, we hypothesized that ACE2 might play a critical role in the host response against 2013 influenza A (H7N9) infection via Ang II.",

ACE2 KO mice that were infected with influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus exhibited survival rates that were reduced significantly compared with WT mice (Figure 2A). Specifically, the survival rate of WT mice was 20%, whereas no KO mice survived for at least 9 days after influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus infection. Similarly, the lung histopathology and lung injury scores, as defined by leukocyte infiltration cell counts, were worsened significantly in ACE2 KO mice compared with WT (Figure 2B). Moreover, lung edema, defined by the wet-to-dry weight ratio of lung tissue, was much more severe in ACE2 KO mice (Figure 2C). In addition, the influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus nucleoprotein (NP) copy number was also increased greatly in the KO mice (Figure 2D). Consistent with this, the lung viral titers of the ACE KO mice were also increased significantly (Figure 2E). Therefore, these results suggest that ACE2 plays an important role in mediating H7N9 influenza-induced ALI, and that interfering with ACE2 expression might attenuate the disease severity and increase survival following respiratory H7N9 infection.",

Similarly, the NP copy number and viral titers were decreased significantly in the lungs of H7N9 virus-infected WT mice treated with AT1 receptor blockers (Figures 3C and D). In contrast, inhibiting AT2 had no significant effect on the ALI phenotypes (Figure S2), suggesting that actions of Ang II via the AT1 receptor play a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced ALI.",

Similarly, the NP copy number and viral titers were decreased significantly in the lungs of H7N9 virus-infected ACE2 KO mice treated with AT1 receptor blockers (Figure 4C and D). Consistent with our observations in WT mice, there was no apparent effect on lung edema and histopathology when ACE2 KO mice were treated with AT2 receptor blockers (data not shown). These results suggest that ACE2 might play a crucial role in influenza A (H7N9) virus infection-induced ALI via the AT1 receptor. Based on these data, schematic diagrams of the RAS in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced ALI have been proposed (Figure 4E). Taken together, these data suggest that the novel influenza H7N9 virus causes severe ALI in a experimental mouse model at least in part by altering the RAS via ACE2 expression that targets AT1.",

Consistent with previous studies21, the current results revealed elevated levels of Ang II in plasma samples from H7N9-infected patients in China. Nevertheless, a considerably larger cohort of H7N9-infected individuals is required to confirm these observations. Influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced ALI results in the significant downregulation of ACE2, which regulates the RAS. Moreover, the current findings provide a molecular explanation for these causes of death and the mechanism of ALI in patients infected with H7N9 influenza. Ang II is upregulated after the downregulation of ACE2, and it then causes severe lung injury via the AT1 receptor during influenza A (H7N9) virus infections.",

The combination of clinical findings and mice experiments has revealed a critical role for the RAS in the pathogenesis of influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced ALI, and demonstrated that ACE2 plays a key role in the development and progression of H7N9 influenza. In addition, the molecular basis by which influenza H7N9 virus infection decreases ACE2 expression should be investigated in future studies.
