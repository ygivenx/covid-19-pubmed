            "text": "Human lungs are composed of three functional and morphological compartments: proximal and distal airways and the alveolar compartment. Proximal airways are lined by a pseudostratified epithelium with a number of cell types with important protective functions such as ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells. More distally, the lining is a simplified columnar epithelium largely made up of non-ciliated secretory cells called Clara cells, and a few ciliated and basal cells. [1], [2]. Further down, the respiratory bronchioles are lined by cuboidal epithelium comprised entirely of ciliated and Clara cells, whereas, the epithelium of the alveolar compartment is comprised of type I and type II cells. In mouse, the pseudostratified epithelium is limited to trachea and extrapulmonary main bronchi while Clara cells make up over 80% of the epithelium, with few interspersed ciliated cells, that line intrapulmonary conducting airways [3]. These features make mouse an excellent tool for studying the functions of Clara cells.",

            "text": "Clara cells have several protective properties. They detoxify xenobiotics and oxidant gasses, control inflammation, participate in mucociliary clearance of environmental agents, and proliferate/differentiate to maintain the ciliated and non-ciliated cell population. Clara cells are a source of cytochrome P450 enzymes that contribute to the metabolism of a variety of substances [4]. In addition to the major Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), also known as CC10, CC16, Clara cell antigen, secretoglobin 1A1 (SCGB1A1) or uteroglobin, Clara cells also contribute surfactant apoproteins A, B and D, proteases, anti-microbial peptides, several cytokines and chemokines, and mucins in the extracellular fluid lining airspaces. CCSP is the most abundant secretory protein found in the airway surface fluid, expressed exclusively in non-ciliated Clara cells and widely used as a marker of the cells [5], [6], [7], [8].Changes in CCSP levels have a profound impact on not only the composition of airway surface fluid but also the airway epithelial response to environmental stimuli [9], [10]. Another important property of Clara cells is their ability to serve as progenitors for airway lining cells in response to injury. Moreover, subpopulations of CCSP-expressing cells may function as true stem cells of adult airways. Presently it is not known whether the groups overlap or represent distinct cells such as variant Clara cells [11], type A cells [12], OCT4-expressing stem cells [13] and bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) [14].",

The major disadvantage of such approaches is the difficulty in performing mechanistic studies in non-neoplastic primary cells. Recently, Wong et al. developed a method for isolating CCSP+ cells from bone marrow by flow cytometry sorting [15]. We speculated that this method may also be used to isolate CCSP+ (Clara) cells from the lung. In this study we established a simple method for the isolation of CCSP+ cells from mouse lung and applied several different means to identify stem cell-like characteristics of CCSP+ cell in vitro and in vivo. We propose that this new procedure method for CCSP+ cell isolation provides a useful instrument for Clara cell research, for instance in the field of stem cell biology.",

Alzet pumps were implanted in mice and removed after one week. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after removal of the Alzet pumps. Lungs were fixed overnight via tracheal instillation of fresh 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin prior to sectioning. Label-retaining cells were identified by BrdU immunofluorescence. BrdU and CCSP double staining was performed and cells exhibiting a nucleus and attachment to basement membrane were counted. Bronchiolioles (BLs) were defined as intrapulmonary airways in which smooth muscle, but neither cartilage nor glands, could be seen. Terminal bronchioles (TBs) contained an intact bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) and visible alveolar duct [17]. In TBs quantification of staining included all cells within 200 \u00b5m of the BADJ. A total 49 TBs and 26 BL structures were analyzed in lung sections of five mice.",

Figure 2A revealed intense immunorectivity along the lining of mouse TB. Recently, Wong AP et al. was able to isolate CCSP+ cells from bone marrow using flow cytometry [15]. Therefore, we postulated that CCSP may be expressed not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the cell membrane of Clara cells. To obtain evidence for this, we used the well-known cell membrane marker pan-Cadherin [18]. Indeed, in high magnification photomicrographs we were able to demonstrate co-expression with pan-Cadherin in the cell membrane using confocal microscope (Figure 2B). These data suggested a possibility for isolating living Clara cells by flow cytometry sorting and lead us to develop the protocol outlined in this study.",

However, the majority of the methods are quite complex and rely on protease digestion followed by centrifugal elutriation and/or Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Only one group used FACS for Clara cell isolation from rat based on the reaction of their glutathione content with monochlorobimine to a fluorescent product [34]. The techniques typically resulted in a Clara cell enrichment of 55\u223c90%. A reproducible source of considerably purified Clara cells is necessary for airway stem/progenitor cell research. Using high concentrations of collagenase for lung tissue digestion followed by flow cytometry sorting, we were able to achieve 98% pure CCSP+ (Clara) cell population, providing a very useful and reliable method for Clara cell function and stem cell research.

However, the level of CD133, Sca-1 and Sox2 expression was lower in CCSP+ cells than that in CCSP\u2212 cells. One possible explanation is that CCSP is a Clara cell differentiation marker, so a CCSP+ population of cells may contain more mature Clara cells, but few stem/progenitor cells, while CCSP\u2212 cells fraction is a mixture of many cells, such as type I, type II, ciliated cells, basal cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblast cells and so on. Many of the cells have been shown to have stem cell features [19], [41]. Sphere culture showed that CCSP+ cells were able to form spheroid colonies. The sphere colony size and efficiency of colony formation were lower in CCSP+ cells compared to CCSP\u2212 cells. This data further suggests that CCSP+ cells do have stem cell features, but stem cell activities are lower than in CCSP\u2212 cells.",
