HIV-1 gp120 is also readily shed from the maturing virions [2] and forms immune complexes in the plasma of HIV-infected [HIV(+)] individuals [3], [4]; consequently only a tiny portion (\u223c0.1%) of circulating virions are actually infectious [5], [6]. HIV-1 gp120 additionally binds to DC-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), initiating an intracellular signalling cascade that promotes viral infection and dissemination to T cells [7], [8]. A subset of CD14(+)DC-SIGN(+) DC has been identified in blood, which can bind HIV-1 and to transmit infectious virus to T cells [9]. The virus then actively replicates in activated CD4 T cells, which are chronically induced during HIV infection by various mechanisms [10], [11].",

            "text": "During progression to AIDS, HIV(+) individuals become increasingly immunosuppressed and susceptible to opportunistic infections and some cancers. This is accompanied by progressive depletion of DC from different anatomical compartments, but the reasons for this remain largely unknown. For example, it has been demonstrated that by in situ hybridization, DC-SIGN expression was significantly reduced in the spleen of SIV-induced AIDS [12]. Furthermore, in late-stage HIV infection, a dramatic depletion of lymph node myeloid DC (mDC) was also observed, with mDC 20-fold less frequent in HIV(+) nodes than in control nodes [13]. Consistently, another report employed flow cytometry and immunofluorescence study to show that the frequencies of lymph node mDC were significantly decreased in a model of simian AIDS [14], suggesting that mDC are lost from rather than being recruited to lymphoid tissue in advanced SIV infection. In addition, mDC from SIV-infected animals undergo spontaneous cell death during culture [14], supporting the hypothesis that the loss of mDC may be due to cell death. Moreover, DC that are annexin V-positive could be identified in the lymph nodes of monkeys with AIDS, indicating that the DC in the LN may be undergoing apoptosis [14].",

            "text": "Under normal circumstances the life-span and availability of DC in vivo is crucial for the induction and maintenance of effective antigen-specific T cell immunity [15], [16]. For example, the magnitude and quality of the CD4 T cell response is proportional to the number of antigen-bearing DC that reach the lymph nodes [17]. Normally, migration of DC from peripheral non-lymphoid sites into secondary lymphoid tissues is promoted by DC maturation, the process by which the cells acquire enhanced capacities for T cell activation and the regulation of immune responses. In peripheral sites of infection and inflammation, DC maturation can be induced by stimuli such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-\u03b2. Within the lymphoid tissues, further DC activation can be induced by activated T cells that upregulate CD40 ligand (CD40L) which ligates CD40 on the DC [18]. DC then undergo apoptosis in a tightly-regulated process. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that the balance between survival versus apoptosis of DC is controlled by differential expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules that are induced during different cellular responses. For example, the above maturation stimuli can activate phosphatydylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) which phosphorylates Akt (p-Akt) [19] and this, in turn, increases expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [20], [21]. It has been further shown that binding of HIV-1 gp120 to DC-SIGN recruits effector proteins to the DC-SIGN signalosome to phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 (p-Raf) [22]. Raf-1 is anti-apoptotic and can in turn antagonize the function of another MAPKKK, apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1) [23]. ASK-1 can also be activated (p-ASK-1) by the above stimuli but is pro-apoptotic, at least in part through its capacity to reduce expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [24]\u2013[26]. Because the regulation of DC survival in peripheral and lymphoid tissues is crucial for the initiation and regulation of immune responses [15], any reduction in DC numbers would result in generalised immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to opportunistic and other infections, as is observed during disease progression to AIDS.",

This finding may in part explain the observation that during acute HIV-1 infection there is rapid accumulation of DC-SIGN(+) cells within the lymphoid tissues [12]. In contrast, as disease progresses chronically to AIDS, circulating and lymphoid tissue-associated DC become progressively depleted [28]\u2013[33]. These include DC-SIGN(+) DC which are markedly reduced in lymph nodes of AIDS patients [34] and in spleens of non-human primates with SIV-induced AIDS [12]. Clinical observations indicate that the increase in serum HIV-1 viral loads correlates well with the decrease in numbers of DC in HIV-1-infected individuals [29], [34]\u2013[37], suggesting that the virus itself or viral products such as shed gp120 may directly impact on DC survival.",

We hypothesised that binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN(+)DC may have an impact on their survival, thus contributing to the cellular depletion observed in the settings above. Here we show that DC which are exposed to HIV-1 gp120, either in vitro or in vivo, undergo accelerated apoptosis when they are exposed to multiple stimuli that normally induce DC maturation. Crucially, we also demonstrate that binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN results in excessive activation of p-ASK-1, and that silencing of ASK-1 effectively reverses this process and promotes DC survival.",

Monocyte-derived DC (moDC) were treated with antibody cross-linked recombinant gp120 (gp120-DC) and co-cultured for 3 d with activated or na\u00efve CD4 T cells. The gp120-DC were readily identifiable within these co-cultures as a distinct, large granular CD3(\u2212)/DC-SIGN(+) cell population (Fig. S1). Analysis of Annexin-V (AV) and propidium iodide (PI) expression in this population revealed that a very high proportion of the gp120-DC underwent apoptosis following co-culture with activated, but not na\u00efve, CD4 T cells (Fig. 1A, right upper vs lower panel). Treatment of moDC with cross-linked gp120 clearly induced apoptosis in both a dose-dependent (Fig. 1B) and time-dependent (Fig. 1C) manner. In our preliminary time-chase experiments, we followed AV/PI reactivity till d4 and found that the AV reactivity of DC reduced from d3 to d4, whereas that of PI increased over time, indicating that as incubation time increases, some cells at early apoptotic (AV+PI\u2212) phase would become late apoptotic (AV+PI+) cells. Nevertheless, the overall AV(+) cells (ie, AV+PI\u2212 plus AV+PI+ cells) remained relatively consistent between d3 and d4 (Figure S1). We therefore chose d3 as our observation time point to compare the % of total AV(+) cells among various treatment conditions. Furthermore, while the cross-linked gp120 prompted DC for activated CD4 T cell-mediated apoptosis, treatment with monomeric gp120 did not (Fig. 1D). The formation of dimeric gp120 after cross-linking with anti-\u201ctag\u201d (anti-His or anti-FLAG Ab) has been confirmed by native non-reducing Western blot analysis (Fig. S2).",

The combination of anti-DC-SIGN mAbs used for these studies substantially reduced the binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN and inhibited HIV-1 uptake (Fig. S3) by the DC-SIGN-transfectants. Indeed, DC-SIGN blockade could significantly prevent DC apoptosis upon coculture with activated CD4 T cells (Fig. 2A & B). Because apoptosis of gp120-primed DC can be CD40L-dependent, we studied if exposure of gp120-DC to CD40L-transfected L (CD40L Tf) would lead to the same outcome. We analysed AV/PI expression of moDC (which expressed HLA-DR, Fig. S4) after separation from the adherent CD40L transfectants (which expressed high levels of CD40L and little HLA-DR, Fig. S4). We found that exposure to CD40L Tf cells also induced significant apoptosis of gp120-DC, compared with exposure to mock L cell transfectants (Fig. 2C, top panels, and Fig. 2D), and cell death was further confirmed by trypan blue staining; Fig. S5). We next tried to delineate the role of other gp120-binding receptors (apart from DC-SIGN) of moDC that might also be responsible for CD40L-induced apoptosis. We first pre-treated moDC with anti-CD4/chemokine receptor and anti-DC-SIGN mAbs, as previously described [38], and pulsed DC with cross-linked recombinant gp120 for coculture with CD40L Tf cells for 3 days. Results showed that in contrast to DC-SIGN blockade, pre-treatment with a combination of anti-CD4/chemokine receptor mAbs did not inhibit moDC apoptosis (Fig. 2C\u2013D). Pre-treatment of moDC with cross-linked ICAM-3, a physiological ligand for DC-SIGN (Fig. S6) that does not prevent gp120 binding, was also ineffective in preventing apoptosis (Fig. 2C\u2013D). Control studies demonstrated that pre-treatment with these antagonistic mAbs alone did not sensitize moDC for CD40-mediated cell death (Fig. S6). Taken together, we conclude that cross-linking of DC-SIGN, but not CD4/chemokine receptors, by recombinant gp120 sensitizes DC for apoptosis after CD40 ligation.",

We adopted two approaches: removing the carbohydrate moieties of recombinant gp120 by EndoH (endo-\u03b2-N-glucosaminidase) before cross-linking with anti-\u201ctag\u201d Abs, and pretreating DC with mannan to compete off the gp120 binding. Because DC express abundant FcR [40] and FcR cross-linking may induce apoptosis of certain cells [41], [42], [43], we also investigated the effect of FcR blockade prior to gp120 pulsing. After EndoH treatment, the deglycosylated monomeric gp120 had reduced molecular weight (\u224880 kDa, reduced from \u2248120 kDa), and after cross-linking in dimeric form, they indeed lost their binding capacity to moDC (Fig. S2). Furthermore, the immune-complex EndoH-treated gp120 lost the ability in sensitizing DC for apoptosis upon CD40 ligation (Fig. 2E, upper row, and Fig. 2F). Pre-treatment of moDC with mannan prior to gp120 pulsing also completely prevented the CD40L-mediated apoptosis, which was more potent than mere DC-SIGN blockade. Moreover, while FcR blockade itself did not induce CD40L-mediated apoptosis of control DC (pulsed with anti-\u201ctag\u201d Ab), it significantly promoted further the extent of CD40L-mediated apoptosis of gp120-DC (Fig. 2E, lower row, and Fig. 2F).",

In order to eliminate the effect of other soluble immune factors, the sera were first centrifuged through filters with a cut-off point of 100 kDa and the >100 kDa fractions were collected and reconstituted to the original volume with fresh medium before use, as described [27]. After 3 d co-culture with autologous activated CD4 T cells, the HIV-1(+) sera-treated moDC were identified as a smaller-sized population than the control moDC, and they were CD3(\u2212) (Fig. S7). These cells were then subjected to TUNEL assays with flow cytometric analysis to evaluate terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression as a measure of apoptosis. This confirmed that HIV(+) serum-pulsed moDC had undergone remarkable apoptosis (\u223c50%, Fig. 3A), and that this could be substantially inhibited by pre-treatment with anti-DC-SIGN mAbs (Fig. 3A\u2013B) or anti-CD40L mAbs (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, excessive apoptosis of moDC was effectively prevented after removal of gp120 from the HIV-1(+) sera by immunoprecipitation (IP) (Fig. 3A\u2013B), under conditions that also depleted virions from cultures of live virus (Fig. S8). Similar results were obtained following co-culture of HIV-1(+) serum-treated moDC with CD40L Tf cells, and further confirmed that CD4 and chemokine receptors were not involved in sensitization for apoptosis (Fig. 3C\u2013D). Therefore, HIV-1(+) sera may contain sufficient levels of immune complexed and/or virion-bound gp120 to sensitize moDC for CD40/CD40L-mediated apoptosis.",

After co-culture with CD40L Tf cells, the extent of DC apoptosis was significantly higher in treatment with serum of relatively high HIV RNA viral loads (Fig. 4A). We next further fractionated the >100 kDa serum fractions into virion-free (100\u20131000 kDa) and virion-enriched (>1000 kDa) portions. The moDC were then treated with these respective fractions and co-cultured with CD40L Tf cells. We detected slightly higher levels of apoptosis after treatment with the virion-enriched portions than controls, but substantial levels of apoptosis was observed after treatment with the virion-free (gp120-enriched) portion (Fig. 4B\u2013C).

Second, turning to upstream components that may lead to these changes we found that p-Raf-1, which can be activated by the DC-SIGN signalosome after gp120 binding, was increased as expected but little further change occurred after exposure to the various stimuli. In marked contrast, each of these stimuli resulted in a marked reduction of p-Akt which is anti-apoptotic, but a very substantial increase in p-ASK1 which is pro-apoptotic. Studying the latter in more detail, we found the expression of p-ASK1 could be reduced virtually to baseline levels (moDC with stimuli alone) by DC-SIGN blockade (Fig. 7A, lower three panels).",

It is unlikely that direct infection and killing of DC by HIV-1 can account for this substantial depletion, given the remarkably low frequency of cells that are actually infected. We present in this study a gp120-exerted mechanism that may account, at least in part, for the progressive depletion of conventional DC subsets, as seen in chronic HIV infection. We provide evidence that moDC can be sensitized by cross-linked recombinant gp120 (Fig. 1 and 2), and HIV-1(+) sera (Fig. 3 and 4), to undergo greatly accelerated apoptosis in response to CD40 ligation, which typically occurs after DC migration into lymphoid tissue. The extent of DC apoptosis was proportional to the concentration of recombinant gp120 (Fig. 1B) and viral RNA loads in the sera (Fig. 4A). These observations were reinforced by the finding that CD14(+)DC-SIGN(+) DC, isolated directly from the blood of healthy [HIV(\u2212)] individuals, could also be sensitized by gp120 for CD40L-induced cell death (Fig. 5). Immunoprecipitation of gp120 from HIV-1(+) sera substantially reduced the extent of apoptosis, showing that either virion-bound gp120 and/or gp120 in the circulating immune-complex form could sensitize the cells (Fig. 3). When we further fractionated the HIV(+) sera, we found that the 100\u20131000 kDa (virion-free) portion promoted substantial levels of apoptosis after CD40 ligation, whereas considerably lower levels were induced by the >1000 kDa (virion-enriched) portion (Fig. 4B\u2013C). Since the molecular weight of IgG is \u223c150\u2013170 kDa, circulating immune-complex gp120 would be contained in the virion-free fractions (100\u20131000 kDa). Therefore, gp120 in immune complexes is primarily responsible for sensitizing DC for apoptosis, and HIV(+) serum we tested contains sufficient quantities of circulating gp120 in vivo to sensitize DC-SIGN(+) DC for apoptosis. However, it remains to be studied if the smaller amount of sensitization by the virion-rich fraction might be induced by activities other than mere gp120/DC-SIGN binding (e.g., events after viral entry). To evaluate our findings further and more directly, we isolated CD14(+)DC-SIGN(+) DC from the blood of HIV(+) individuals and found that they were indeed \u2018pre-sensitized\u2019 for apoptosis on CD40 ligation (Fig. 5). Moreover, both these blood DC from HIV(+) individuals and moDC sensitized by recombinant or serum gp120 underwent substantial apoptosis after exposure to bacterial LPS and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 6), apart from CD40 ligation.",

            "text": "Amongst HIV-1 encoded proteins, the envelope protein gp120 has two very unusual properties, even for a retroviral envelope component: first, gp120 is only loosely attached to the virion and is rapidly shed in large quantities into the circulation [3], and second, liberated gp120 binds to and activates a very high proportion of B cells [28], [45], resulting in a massive overproduction of anti-gp120 antibodies and the formation of increasing amounts of immune complexes in the serum. Our findings now reveal that through ligation of immune-complex gp120 to DC-SIGN and mannose C-type lectin receptors (MCLRs), apoptosis of DC is remarkably promoted when the cells encounter diverse maturation stimuli that are otherwise prerequisites for the effective initiation and regulation of many immune responses. The concentration of \u201cfree gp120\u201d in the HIV(+) serum has been studied by many groups, varying from \u201cpM\u201d to \u201cnM\u201d levels [3], [4], [46], [47]. However, most reports determining the free gp120 in HIV(+) serum employed an antigen capture assay (eg, ELISA) without taking into account the presence of anti-gp120 Ab in the serum, which could significantly mask the detection of free gp120 and sometimes completely abrogate the signals [4]. The levels of \u201cfree gp120\u201d detected in previous reports, thus, may not represent those of antibody-bound gp120. It has been demonstrated that anti-gp120 Abs are present in the HIV(+) serum at high enough concentrations to bind most of gp120 [48] and the levels of anti-gp120 Abs have been estimated to be in the micromolar range [49]. Therefore, for high affinity binding (Kd<10 nM between gp120 and anti-gp120 Ab), virtually all the gp120 in the HIV(+) serum might have been occupied (saturated) by antibodies [48]. In a recent report, it has been estimated that the gp120 levels could be up to 5 \u00b5g/ml when concentrations of all forms (soluble and cell/virion-bound) are added, in situations of high plasma viremia [47]. The concentration of the immune-complex gp120 we used in the current study, therefore, is not incompatible with the in vivo scenario. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that even in the same experimental model, DC might have different reactivity over AV or PI in the viability assay. Throughout the entire study, around 50% of the donors had more exaggerated PI staining, while the other had more prominent AV staining (for instance, Fig. 5B\nvs 5C). It is likely that DC from different individuals may have different responsiveness to activation signals such as CD40 ligation, a phenomenon of \u201cdonor-to-donor variation\u201d, which has been recently reported for HIV gp120 binding to moDC to induce IL-10 and impair IL-12 production [24]. Differential responsiveness to CD40 ligation in DC has also been reported that in mouse DC which express CD40high could produce more IL-12 but less IL-10 than those produced by the CD40low DC [50]. It deserves further investigation to see if the expression levels of CD40 of moDC correlate with the degree of CD40L-mediated apoptosis, and if DC apoptosis may also be accompanied by IL-10 production [24].",

            "text": "In studies to identify the membrane receptor(s) on DC through which cross-linked gp120 and HIV(+) sera can sensitize the cells, we observed that apoptosis was considerably reduced after pre-treatment with antagonistic mAbs specific for DC-SIGN, but not a combination of CD4 and chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 (Fig. 2A\u2013D, Fig. 3C\u2013D, 5B and 6D). In contrast, pre-treatment of DC with a cross-linked, Fc construct of ICAM-3, a physiological ligand for DC-SIGN important for stabilizing the DC-na\u00efve T cell immune synapse [51], was ineffective (Fig. 2C\u2013D). This is in accordance with previous reports that the binding site for ICAM-3 is distinct from that of gp120 [52], and that soluble ICAM-3 is not able to compete efficiently with HIV-1 envelope protein or with intact viruses for binding to DC-SIGN [53]. Notably, the inhibition of apoptosis by DC-SIGN blockade was substantial but incomplete, apparently reflecting the relative capacity of the combination of mAbs to prevent binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN (Fig. S3). Furthermore, other MCLRs in addition to DC-SIGN that can bind gp120 [32] are also involved in DC apoptosis, because pre-treatment of DC with mannan led to virtually complete diminishment of the CD40L-mediated DC death, in contrast to partial (albeit significant) inhibition by DC-SIGN blockade (Fig. 2E\u2013F). Moreover, we agree with a previous report [39] and confirm that gp120 binding to moDC is exclusively carbohydrate-dependent because the binding capacity of deglycosylated gp120 (whose carbohydrate moieties were removed by EndoH treatment) to moDC was completely lost (Fig. S2), resulting in total abrogation of CD40L-mediated apoptosis of gp120-DC (Fig. 2E & F). Similar effects were also demonstrated in the use of HIV(+) serum (Fig. S9).",

This suggests that cross-linking of DC-SIGN is required for sensitization. Indeed, antibody cross-linking of DC-SIGN [54] and the binding of HIV-1 gp120 [8] or many other pathogens [55]\u2013[58] have been shown to initiate diverse intracellular signalling pathways in DC that lead to different cellular responses. Along with this thought, we blocked the Fc receptor (FcR) of moDC (before pulse by immune-complex gp120 or HIV(+) serum) in order to allow more potent clusterization of DC-SIGN or other MCLRs. This indeed resulted in more abundant DC apoptosis (Fig. 2E\u2013F & Fig. S9). This finding further supports the involvement of DC-SIGN or MCLRs in gp120 sensitization for CD40L-induced DC death. Another point to support DC-SIGN for gp120-triggered intracellular signalling is that, apart from sensitizing DC for accelerated activation-induced death, gp120 can also induce phenotypic changes of DC that are typical of maturation (Fig. S11). The role of MCLRs in gp120-mediated DC phenotypic maturation has also been reported by others [44]. Therefore, immune-complex gp120 binding to DC-SIGN (or other MLCRs) may have sensitized DC into a \u201cpre-mature\u201d state, which may be a pre-requisite that prompted DC to be more vulnerable to activation-induced apoptosis. However, when compared with conventional maturation (e.g., LPS/TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 and CD40 ligation), the gp120-induced phenotypic \u201cmaturation\u201d appeared inefficient, as manifested by less remarkable upregulation of CD80, CD86, CD83 and CCR7. The CCR5 downregulation was also less noticeable than that induced by conventional factors; in contrast, MHC class II upregulation remained relatively unaffected (Fig. S11). Such inefficient maturation is in line with a previous report that gp120 binding to MCLRs can induce immunosuppressive responses from DC, such as IL-10 production, which may subsequently contribute to a weaker T cell stimulation capacity [24].",

Turning to upstream components that may account for these observations and explain excessive apoptosis, we found that gp120 binding activated Raf-1, an anti-apoptotic through its activity to restrict caspase activation [41], as reported by others [22], and its expression was not significantly modulated upon exposure to maturation stimuli (Fig. 7A). Strikingly, however, anti-apoptotic p-Akt was markedly reduced whereas pro-apoptotic ASK-1 was very substantially increased. Crucially, pre-treatment of gp120-DC with anti-DC-SIGN mAbs reduced ASK-1 activation back to control levels (Fig. 7A), while siRNA silencing of this component substantially prevented DC apoptosis (Fig. 7B). Hence, gp120 binding to DC-SIGN activates ASK-1 and further exposure to the different maturation stimuli results in abundant p-ASK-1 expression which may account for the excessive levels of apoptosis. Whether or not this is directly due to activation of a novel ASK-1-dependent signalling pathway after gp120 ligation of DC-SIGN, or another pathway that releases inhibition by p-Akt, deserves further attention. Furthermore, since HIV-1 Nef can suppress ASK-1 activation in infected T cells to protect them from apoptosis [49], it would be interesting to determine whether or not infected DC can be protected in a similar manner while the uninfected \u2018bystander\u2019 cells are killed.",

We further propose that during disease progression to AIDS, this may contribute to the decreased capacity to mount effective immune responses [15]\u2013[17], [59] and also to increased susceptibility to multiple opportunistic infections. In fact, the types of infection that are seen during AIDS progression somewhat resemble those described for some of the recently identified DC deficiency syndromes [13]. The presence of LPS, resulting from, for example, the mucosal barrier of the GALT being compromised or concomitant bacterial infections [14], [50], can also potentiate HIV-induced immunosuppression through augmentation of HIV-1 gene expression at least in part by stimulating the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 [60]; high levels of circulating TNF-\u03b1 can also be detected in HIV-infected individuals [61]. These factors could well predispose \u2018bystander\u2019 DC-SIGN(+) cells, which have been pre-sensitized by gp120 in the serum, for exorbitant apoptosis in the lymphoid tissues or blood.",

Also, whether the subsequent modulation of TLR responsiveness can additionally or synergistically contribute to the defects of pathogen-specific immunity in AIDS warrants further investigation. In a narrower context, it is also clear that many other mechanisms can contribute to depletion of different subsets of DC during HIV-1 infection, including negative control of the numbers of plasmacytoid DC by type I interferons [28]. Whether or not binding of gp120 to other membrane receptors of DC can sensitize the respective subsets for apoptosis also needs to be further clarified. Finally, accelerated activation-induced apoptosis of gp120-sensitized DC is accompanied by excessive activation of ASK-1, and that silencing of ASK1 prevents apoptosis, implying that antagonistic ASK1 therapies, such as have been shown to reduce SIV encephalitis in macaques [48], might be of value to prevent DC depletion during HIV-1 disease progression.",

Recombinant His-tagged gp120ADA, and FLAG-tagged gp120BAL and gp120HXBc2, were prepared as described [27]; each contained <5 EU/ml LPS by Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. 1\u00d7105 moDC were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning Life Sciences Corp., USA) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h in culture medium as described [27] with 50 nM recombinant R5 (HIV-1ADA and HIV-1BAL), or X4 (HIV-1HXBc2) gp120. Before use, the gp120 was cross-linked by incubating for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with respective anti-His (mouse IgG2a isotype) or anti-FLAG (mouse IgG1 isotype) mAbs (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, USA) at a molar ratio 2\u22361 (gp120 vs anti-His or anti-FLAG mAb), resulting final cross-linked gp120 of 25 nM. Therefore, gp120 was used in an immune-complex rather than monomeric form, unless otherwise stated. In experiments to remove the carbohydrate moieties of gp120 by enzymatic digestion, we pre-treated the monomeric recombinant gp120 with endo-\u03b2-N-glucosaminidase H (EndoH; New England Biolabs, Cambridge, Mass, USA) by incubating recombinant gp120 supernatant with 25 KU of EndoH/ml for 16\u201318 hours, as described [39]. The extent of deglycosylation was then examined and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-gp120 antibodies (Fig. S2A). We then cross-linked the EndoH-treated monomeric gp120 (which had poly-His or FLAG at the COOH terminus) with anti-His or anti-FLAG Ab to form immune-complex (dimeric) gp120, as described above. The cross-linked EndoH-treated and -untreated gp120 were further examined by Western blot analysis in native non-reducing conditions, confirming the dimerization after addition of anti-His or anti-FLAG Ab (Fig. S2B). The binding of Endo-treated and -untreated dimeric gp120 to moDC was subsequently compared by flow cytometry, demonstrating that EndoH-treated gp120 had lost the binding to moDC (Fig. S2C).",
