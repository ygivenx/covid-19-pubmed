Extensive studies have demonstrated that EPAC proteins are important signaling molecules involved in modulating a myriad of physiological functions3\u20135, ranging from energy homeostasis6\u20138 and insulin secretion9, 10 to learning and memory11, 12. In addition, EPAC proteins have also been shown to act as major stress-response mediators and play key roles in the development of human diseases, such as cancer13\u201316, chronic pain17\u201319, cardiovascular diseases20, 21 and infection22, 23. Therefore, developing small molecule EPAC-specific modulators has evolved into an active area of research within the field for the last few years24\u201326. Several recent studies have reported the effective development of EPAC-specific antagonists using high throughput screening (HTS) biochemical assays27\u201329. However, a robust cell-based assay equipped to measure the activity of EPAC proteins in a medium to high throughput setup is lacking. In this study, the design and execution of an isoform specific cell-based assay capable of measuring cellular activity of EPAC proteins in a microplate format are described.",

Activation of EPAC1 or EPAC2 in these cell lines by cAMP elevating agents leads to the accumulation of Flag-Rap1-GTP, which can be captured by RalGDS-RBD immobilized in a nickel-coated 96-well microplate. The levels of active Flag-Rap1-GTP protein can be quantitatively monitored using a specific anti-FLAG antibody and a HRP conjugated secondary antibody in a manner similar to that of a conventional ELISA assay (Fig. 1).\n",

To optimize the assay, individual stable clones of HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 or HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 were first established and tested for their basal Rap1-GTP activates. Overall, HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 cells had higher basal Rap1-GTP activates than their hEPAC1 counterparts, and the basal activities varied within a range of 3-fold among different stable clones. Stable clones with lowest basal activity for HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 or HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 were selected, expanded and used for subsequent studies. After minimizing the basal Rap1-GTP activates, the levels of total lysate proteins that were optimal to be used for the assay were further determined by testing the signal response as a function of total lysate proteins applied in the assay. As shown in Fig. 2, above background signal could be detected with as little as 0.8 \u00b5g total proteins from HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 cell lysate stimulated by1 \u00b5M of 8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP-AM (007-AM), a membrane permeable EPAC-specific agonist30. The signal readouts were roughly a linear function of the total protein applied up to 25 \u00b5g. Therefore, 20 \u00b5g total lysate proteins were used for subsequent assay development and optimization.\n",

Treatment of HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 or HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 cells with forskolin led to a dose-dependent increase in Rap1-GTP levels in both cell lines (Fig. 3A,B). Forskolin activated HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 or HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 cells with similar potencies with apparent half maximal activation constants (AC50) of 226 \u00b1 57 and 137 \u00b1 36 nM, respectively (Fig. 3C). Using a conventional affinity pull-down assay32, a similar dose-dependent activation of Rap1 by forskolin in HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 cells was observed (Supplemental Fig. 1). Since forskolin-mediated increase in intracellular cAMP activates both EPAC and PKA, to ensure that the signals observed in our assay were not in part due to the activation of PKA, control experiments in the presence of a PKA-specific inhibitor, H89, were performed. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 2, the effects of 10 \u00b5M H89 on both basal and forskolin-induced Rap1 activities were minimal, suggesting the readouts observed in HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 or HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 cells in response to forskolin activation were mediated by EPAC1 or EPAC2, respectively.\n",

The development of a cell-based assay for the discovery of EPAC-specific modulators has become an important area of research. Conventionally, EPAC cellular activity is assayed by monitoring relative cellular Rap-GTP levels using affinity pull-down with purified recombinant GST-RalGDS-RBD, which preferentially binds Rap-GTP over Rap-GDP with approximate 4,000-fold selectivity32. The levels of Rap-GTP from the affinity pull-down are further evaluated using immunoblotting analysis. This approach is laborious, time-consuming, costly, and involves a multi-step procedure prone to operational errors. Furthermore, Western blot analysis is difficult to quantify and not suitable for medium to high throughput experiments. To overcome these obstacles, a cell-based EPAC assay that enables the detection and quantification of EPAC-mediated cellular Rap1 activation under the microplate format has been designed, developed and optimized. In this assay, the immobilization of the purified His6-tagged RalGDS-RBD in the nickel-coated well of a 96-well plate allows convenient capture of active Rap1-GTP from the cell lysate, which can be easily monitored and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent detection using a microplate reader.",

This new assay has several clear advantages over other existing cell-based EPAC assays. Compared to the traditional bead-based Rap-GTP pull-down assay, the immobilized RalGDS-RBD bait in microplate enables assay miniaturization and automation. In fact, the assay can be performed in parallel for a large number of samples, each with as little as a few micrograms of total lysates. Moreover, if offers more reproducible and consistent capture of the Rap-GTP protein in the lysate and allows more convenient and reliable signal detection and quantification. By adapting a microplate format, our assay eliminates the need of centrifugation washing steps and immune-blotting based detection. Hence, the entire assay can be performed within hours, instead of days. Another alternative cellular EPAC assay utilizes EPAC-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) sensors. These genetically engineered sensors can be ectopically expressed in various cells for the detection of generation of intracellular cAMP in live cells in a spatial and temporal manner36\u201338. While cells stably expressing these biosensors can be adapted for microplate format assays, the signal-to-noise and dynamic range of these biosensors are normally poor and not adequate for HTS. Importantly, positive FRET or BRET signals driven by conformational changes of EPAC proteins do not always correlate with EPAC activation or inhibition, and conversely allosteric modulators of EPAC may not necessarily induce conformational changes that affect FRET/BRET-based readout. These drawbacks limit the general applicability of using EPAC-based biosensors for functional cell-based EPAC assays.",

            "text": "During the development of the assay, it became apparent that ectopic expression of EPAC and Rap1 raised the basal level of active Rap1, which decreased signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of the assay. In particular, HEK293/mEPAC2/Flag-Rap1 cells had higher baselines of active Rap1-GTP as compared those of HEK293/hEPAC/Flag-Rap1 cells. This is most likely due to the fact that EPAC2 protein has a more than three-fold higher affinity for cAMP than EPAC1 protein. Through careful selection of cell clones with low levels EPAC and Rap1 expression, suitable signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range could be achieved. Ultimately, the use of an inducible expression system or genomic knock-in may provide a better solution of solving the aforementioned high basal activity problem. Another alternative is to use the endogenously expressed Rap1 protein as the readout, however, the absence of highly specific and sensitive Rap1 antibodies prevents its execution as currently available anti-Rap1 antibodies lack appropriate specificity and sensitivity for monitoring endogenous Rap1 activation using the microplate format.",
