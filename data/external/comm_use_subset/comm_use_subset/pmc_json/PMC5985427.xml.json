Traditional disease surveillance is the continuous systematic collection, analysis and evaluation of health information from formal sources. These systems often rely on health-care professionals and diagnostic laboratory data to report information on the illnesses seen in clinical practice, in what is referred to as passive disease surveillance. This information is generally collected, analysed and disseminated by local health authorities, who report to centralized health ministries.1 While the information received is often highly reliable and verified within a uniform structure for reporting, traditional disease surveillance techniques face several challenges. These include: missing information from populations who do not access health care or do so through informal channels; unsuitability to detect new, potentially high-impact outbreaks (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome); and delays in reporting due to difficulties in obtaining specimens for testing or due to delayed laboratory confirmation.",

The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), a programme of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, pioneered innovative disease surveillance using the internet and has provided event-based surveillance for emerging infectious diseases since 1994.4,5 The inherent transparency and variety of sources available for event-based surveillance have been credited with speeding up the discovery and public communication of outbreaks.6 However, signals for event-based surveillance, which include media and first-hand reports from astute observers, are often initially unverified by public health authorities or laboratory results. Disease control measures may be delayed while waiting for confirmation.7 As an early warning system, ProMED frequently issues preliminary reports of potential public health events as a request for information in an attempt to elicit further verification of these events. However, these requests for information are sent to the entire ProMED membership (> 87 000 subscribers) and our internal data show that they go unanswered up to 95% of the time.",

Aligning with the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) interest in countries developing event-based surveillance systems, EpiCore utilizes crowdsourcing to gather supplementary information to validate rumours and informal reports about disease outbreaks.

Located around the world, these ProMED moderators were deployed to continuously collect and analyse formal and informal reports of potential outbreaks in humans, animals and agricultural plants. Formal information sources included reports and information from health ministries, WHO, academic institutions and NGOs. Informal sources could be articles in the local press or media, reports from individual clinicians or field-based NGO staff, as well as internet-based media such as discussion forums, blogs and social networking sites. When a requester discovered an unverified report of a potential outbreak, he or she used the EpiCore online platform to send a request for information to a selected group of EpiCore responders in a geographical region. Responders received the request in an email and used their on-the-ground knowledge and professional expertise to respond via the online platform. If the requester judged that the information was useful, he or she prepared a ProMED posting using the information provided by the responder and the level of confidentiality requested. This was posted to the ProMED website (http://www.promedmail.org) and sent in an email to ProMED\u2019s more than 87 000 subscribers from 195 countries.

To maintain confidentiality, responders were identified in the platform by a unique responder identification number. The requester was not able to identify the responders unless the responders chose to include their name and information when responding to a request for information. Responders had three choices about how their response would be used in a subsequent ProMED post: (i) paraphrase or do not use direct quotes from this response, mask any identifying information referenced in the response text and do not provide any details on my identity; (ii) quote this response, but mask identifying information referenced in the response text and do not provide any details on my identity; (iii) quote this response and attribute it to me.

Each response that led to a ProMED report was evaluated by two of the authors to determine whether a report supported verification (indicated laboratory or other confirmatory data supporting the diagnosis), refuted verification (negative laboratory data or finding of an alternative diagnosis) or provided additional information (such as serotype or information on extent of an outbreak).

            "text": "Current challenges and limitations of EpiCore include the uneven geographical distribution of responders, with some countries and regions over-represented and others, including some hotspots for emerging diseases, under-represented. Some countries have no or very few responders. This is due in part to recruitment efforts being driven by the location of infectious disease conferences, ProMED subscribers and partner organizations. Not all requests for information received helpful responses and some requests for information generated more responses than could be easily used. Responses to requests for information are evaluated on their usefulness by the requester, which is subjective. A high level of expertise is required by the requester to properly frame the queries included in requests for information and to interpret responses meaningfully. Some responders, despite the promise of anonymity, expressed misgivings about providing responses when this conflicted with the confidentiality requirements of their other professional duties. Neither ProMED nor EpiCore respond directly to public health outbreaks and emergencies. The goal is to provide actionable information, but it is too early in the project to identify specific actions taken as a result of EpiCore responses. In the future, we will tabulate public health responses to events, although any action taken cannot necessarily be attributed to EpiCore since public health authorities could be acting on information received elsewhere.",

A secure digital platform was developed that facilitated swift interaction between information requesters and EpiCore responders in targeted geographical areas, while safeguarding the confidentiality of EpiCore responders. Requesters could then rapidly and transparently disseminate additional information supporting or refuting the veracity of outbreaks through ProMED so that appropriate public health action could occur.",

EpiCore is meant to be a complementary tool supporting traditional and official surveillance systems through crowdsourcing. As ProMED subscribers include many personnel from the WHO, World Organisation for Animal Health, national ministries of health and agriculture and many regional and local health authorities, the information EpiCore obtains reaches those subscribers. In many cases, the initial reports of events of potential interest to the health sector (both human and animal) are found in media reports that do not include confirmation from government sources. In those cases, the reports generated by responses may assist WHO and national governments in their own verification processes.",

The software will include enhancements to the user experience for both requesters and responders that we expect will lead to improved response rates and quality. We plan to provide greater engagement with responders through more frequent communication, additional requester groups and non-monetary incentives. Finally, we plan to recruit responders from regions not currently adequately represented and to include subject-matter expert responders who can help provide information on potential outbreaks regardless of geographical location. Results from this initial period will provide baseline rates against which future responses can be assessed. Ultimately, we believe this will contribute to faster outbreak detection and quicker responses, limiting the extent of outbreaks and preventing pandemics.14",
