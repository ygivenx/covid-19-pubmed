Due to its potential threat, MERS-CoV has been listed as a Category C Priority Pathogen by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. However, neither licensed vaccines nor antiviral drugs against MERS-CoV have been approved for clinical use. Efficient countermeasures against this virus are urgently needed.",

The MERS-CoV genome is ~30 kb and encodes the 5\u2032-replicase structural protein (spike-envelope-membrane-nucleocapsid)-poly (A)-3\u2032.13, 14, 15 The highly glycosylated spike (S) protein mediates viral infections and is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis. It assembles as a trimer on the viral particle surface and contains two functional subunits. The S1 subunit (residues 1\u2013751) is mainly responsible for mediating viral particle attachment to the cell surface and is dependent on the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor.16, 17 The S2 subunit (residues 752\u20131353) facilitates the subsequent fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane (Figures 1A and 1B). To deliver the viral nucleic acid into the host cell, the S1 subunit binds to the cellular receptor and triggers conformational changes in the S2 subunit, which then inserts its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane to form a six-helix bundle fusion core that prepares the viral and cell membranes for fusion.19",

NTD has been recognized as the receptor-binding site in several CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus.41 In this study, we discovered a neutralizing mAb that specifically recognizes the MERS-CoV S protein NTD. This study highlights the importance of the region in the viral infection process, which may enable us to better understand the underlying neutralizing mechanism of natural MERS-CoV infection. These findings pave the way for MERS-CoV vaccine and immunotherapy development.",

            "text": "The surface S segment is the major CoV structural protein, and maintaining the quaternary nature of the S1\u2013S2 complex is vital for viral infections. Recently, one study showed that SARS-CoV infection is affected by the inactive-to-active state transition of the S glycoprotein trimer. In addition, the loops connecting the NTD to the C-terminal domain (CTD) 1 and CTD1 to CTD2 were found to play key roles in the conformational switch.43 Lassa virus (LASV) envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC) is another class I viral fusion protein that initiates infection by processing into GP1, GP2 and an unusual stable signal peptide (SSP). GP1 is responsible for receptor binding, while GP2 mediates the fusion of the virion with a cell membrane. Previous studies demonstrated that gaps in the glycan shield of LASV GPC permitted neutralizing antibodies to interact simultaneously with the N-terminal extension of GP1 and either the fusion loop or the T-loop of GP2, inhibiting the structural alterations required for fusion.44 These discoveries showed that maintaining glycoprotein structural integrity during viral infection is necessary and that neutralizing mAbs targeting different surface glycoprotein epitopes can interfere with structural state switching. As shown in Figures 1A and 1B, structural docking of the MERS-CoV S protein revealed the NTD and C-terminal RBD of the S1 subunit, which form extensive quaternary interactions with each other. These features may imply that certain epitopes on the NTD of MERS-CoV S1 are structurally or functionally close to the ones on the RBD and that the mAbs targeting these epitopes can interfere with receptor binding or the post-fusion stage.",

A neutralizing mAb against the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein was found to bind to the residues and glycans on gp41 and gp120, thereby precluding the CD4- and/or co-receptor-induced conformational changes required for membrane fusion.45 The S proteins of the Coronaviridae family, consisting of four genera (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-CoVs), are also class I envelope glycoproteins, and all use the S1 protein RBD or NTD to interact with cellular receptors or co-receptors for viral attachment.46 To the best of our knowledge, most \u03b1-CoVs and some \u03b2-CoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1, use protein moieties as their recognition receptors, and their main functional RBDs are located in the CTD of S1. In contrast, the RBDs of bovine CoV, human CoV OC43 and one avian \u03b3-CoV are located in the NTD, and sugar moieties are the main receptors. More notably, the NTD and CTD of two \u03b1-CoVs, porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV and transmissible gastroenteritis, might both play vital roles in viral infection.47, 48 The NTD of MERS-CoV is also glycosylated, and the neutralizing mAb 5F9 may bind to the glycan or other residues of the NTD, stabilizing the pre-fusion conformation of the S protein and the S1\u2013S2 interaction, thereby precluding the DPP4- and/or co-receptor-induced conformational changes required for membrane fusion.",

Currently, various vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against MERS-CoV are under development, and most have targeted the MERS-CoV RBD because it contains the most variable regions. Multiple evaluations of the full length S-based or truncated S1-based vaccines indicate that an increase in epitope range would be important for future MERS-CoV vaccine designs.49, 50 Our study suggested that the NTD, which contains the neutralizing epitope, should be considered an immunogenic component. Thus, we propose that combining the most promising vaccine candidate with the NTD would not only improve the protective effects but also reduce the likelihood of possible resistance development via mutation.",
