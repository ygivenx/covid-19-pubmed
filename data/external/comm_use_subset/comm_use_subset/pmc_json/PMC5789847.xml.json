Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been categorized as one of the urgent threats by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) and kill almost half of in-patients who get bloodstream infections from these bacteria1. As one of the resistance determinants, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs), including imipenemases (IMPs), Verona integron-encoded metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (VIMs), and more recent New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (NDMs), are Zn(II)-containing enzymes that activate a nucleophilic water to cleave the \u03b2-lactam ring, conferring onto bacteria the resistance to the last resort carbapenems and all other bicyclic \u03b2-lactams that are currently used2\u20134. In particular, NDM-1-positive bacteria cause various types of infections and have spread globally now in more than 70 countries5 since its first detection in 20096\u20138. The geographic dissemination of NDM-1-related resistance raises great consternation because this resistance is highly transferable among many prevalent human pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, and Acinetobacter spp9, and is usually accompanied by genes encoding other resistance determinants10,11 or even other carbapenemases12 in those organisms, arming them with multiple resistance to almost all classes of antibiotics available. Currently, few therapeutic options are available to treat infection from these so-called \u201csuperbugs\u201d13.",

Such combination therapies are currently used clinically to treat infection from serine-\u03b2-lactamases (SBLs)-positive bacteria e.g., Augmentin\u00ae (amoxicillin/clavulanate), Zosyn\u00ae (piperacillin/tazobactam), and recent Avycaz\u00ae (ceftazidime/avibactam). However, up till now, no equivalent therapy is available for MBLs-positive bacterial infections, as no MBL inhibitor has been clinically approved and all clinically used SBL inhibitors are not effective toward MBLs18. It remains a significant challenge to design MBL inhibitors, particularly broad-spectrum MBL inhibitors, given the structural diversity and mechanistic complexities of MBLs14. Though chelation agents such as ethylenediamine-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetate (EDTA) and aspergillomarasmine A19 significantly inhibit MBLs, such indiscriminate chelating of Zn(II) might result in untoward effects on natural or endogenous metalloproteins that are critical for many biological functions18. Currently, most organic molecule-based MBL inhibitors, including pyridine dicarboxylates, thiol-derivatives, natural products, and even carbapenem analogs, are designed by mimicking the substrates of specific types of MBLs, and have been shown to reduce MBL activity of specific types both in vitro and in animal models14,19\u201324. However, it still remains questionable whether or when these inhibitors can be approved for clinical usage. Moreover, these inhibitors may readily encounter microbial resistance owing to rapid evolution of MBLs21,25. Therefore, more effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.",

The combined use of CBS with a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic not only restores antibiotic activity, but also significantly reduces the NDM-1 evolution in NDM-1-positive Escherichia coli (E. coli). Moreover, CBS boosts the in vivo efficacy of \u03b2-lactam in murine peritonitis models. Crystallographic and biophysical studies demonstrate that Bi(III) compounds irreversibly inactivate NDM-1 by a unique mechanism, with one Bi(III) replacing two zinc ions in the active site. Cysteine (Cys208) at the active site is shown to play a pivotal role for the activity of Bi(III) compounds. Our studies strongly suggest that Bi(III) drugs or compounds might be repositioned or developed as the first broad-spectrum inhibitors of MBLs, in particular, class B1 MBLs. This study provides a new opportunity to design effective broad-spectrum MBL inhibitors for the treatment of infection caused by MBL-positive bacteria together with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.",

The NDM-1-producing strain was confirmed to be resistant to a carbapenem, meropenem (MER) as judged by its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 16 \u00b5g mL\u22121, which is higher than the breakpoint value (>8 \u00b5g mL\u22121) for MER against Enterobacteriaceae defined by European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)34. The growth inhibition was examined in the presence of 10, 50, and 200 \u00b5M of a panel of metal compounds and MER at subinhibitory concentration (\u00bdMIC) for 24 h after bacterial inoculation. Primary screening gave rise to two active metal compounds i.e., bismuth nitrate (Bi(NIT)3) and gallium nitrate with >90% growth inhibition based on optical density (OD) reading (Supplementary Fig. 1a). (Bi(NIT)3) showed higher bioactivity than gallium nitrate in the subsequent colony-forming unit (CFU) counting, in which, surprisingly, no colony was observed in agar plate after serial dilutions when (Bi(NIT)3) was used (Supplementary Fig. 1b). This implies that Bi(III) compounds may facilitate MER to kill NDM-1 producer. Given its clinical usage for the treatment of H. pylori infection, CBS was selected to further evaluate whether it can be repurposed to treat MBL-positive bacterial infection together with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.",

            "text": "We first examined whether CBS (Fig. 1a) can resensitize NDM-1 producers toward carbapenem using MER as an example. Standard checkerboard microdilution method was used to monitor the interaction between MER and CBS against NDM-HK. A strain cured of pNDM-HK served as NDM-1-negative control, denoted as NDM-HK PCV (plasmid cured variant), with MIC of 0.03 \u00b5g mL-1 for MER. CBS itself showed no or minor growth inhibition toward either NDM-1-positive (Fig. 1b) or negative bacteria (Fig. 1c) even at 256 \u00b5g mL-1; however, when MER and CBS were used in combination, the MIC values of MER against NDM-HK gradually dropped to 2 \u00b5g mL-1 (Fig. 1b and Table 1), which is the empirical susceptible level according to EUCAST34, and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was determined to be 0.250 (Supplementary Table 2), indicative of the synergistic interaction between them (FICI \u22640.5 is defined as synergism). By contrast, no such synergism was detected in NDM-HK PCV (FICI = 2 as shown in Fig. 1c). The potent synergy is also demonstrated by time kill curves, which show that the population of NDM-HK at the exponential phase is significantly lowered (by more than 1000-fold) upon exposure to the drug combination of MER and CBS for 24 h (Fig. 1d). CBS could reduce MIC values of MER toward NDM-1-positive, but not negative strain, suggesting that CBS might abolish the enzymatic activity of NDM-1.",

Comparable half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of CBS were observed for NDM-1, VIM-2, and IMP-4, which were determined to be 2.81, 3.54, and 0.70 \u00b5M, respectively (Fig. 1e and Table 2). In consistence with cell-based studies, the results of the enzymatic assays confirm the capability of CBS in restoring MER antimicrobial activity was attributable to its inhibition on NDM-1 activity. We also observed a similar synergism pattern of the combination of CBS and MER in checkerboard assay against a panel of enterobacterial strains i.e., E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia (NDM-K. pneumonia), and Citrobacter freundii (NDM-C. freundii) that harbor different MBLs (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 2). Collectively, we show that CBS is a potential broad-spectrum inhibitor of B1 MBLs regardless of their (sub)types or the Enterobacteriaceae that produce them.",

Our results demonstrate that all tested Bi(III) compounds synergized with MER as adjudged by the FICI values ranging from 0.047 to 0.375, and the MIC of MER decreased by 8\u201364-fold (Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2). Four typical Bi(III) compounds were shown in Table 1 to exemplify their potent synergy with MER against different MBL producers. In particular, a complex of bismuth with N-acetyl-cysteine (Bi(NAC)3) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against different MBL-positive strains with a 32-fold, 64-fold, and 16-fold decrease in the MIC of MER against NDM-1-positive, VIM-2-positive, and IMP-4-positive E. coli, respectively, and the FICI values ranged from 0.063 to 0.188 (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The combination of MER and Bi(NAC)3 was able to eradicate the bacterium completely within 6 h (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Such an excellent inhibitory activity may arise from cooperative inhibition of Bi(III) ions and NAC ligand dissociated from Bi(NAC)3, as well as elevated cellular uptake of Bi(III) (Supplementary Fig. 4b).",

As shown in Fig. 2a, addition of Bi(III) (as Bi(NTA)) to apo-NDM-1 led to the appearance of an absorption band at 340 nm, which is characteristic for Bi\u2013S ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band. Its intensities increased, and then leveled off at a molar ratio of [Bi]/[protein] of 1, suggesting that each NDM-1 bound to one Bi(III) and a cysteine residue was involved in the binding. By fitting the titration curve with the Ryan\u2013Weber nonlinear equation35, Kd was calculated to be 10.95 \u03bcM. Taking into account of the binding between Bi(III) and NTA (log Ka = 17.55), the apparent dissociation constant (Kd\u2019) was calculated to be 3.09 \u00d7 10\u221217 \u03bcM. As there is only one cysteine (Cys208) at the active site, site-directed mutation of Cys208 to an alanine (as C208A) abolished the enzymatic activity by ~80% under identical conditions, confirming the importance of this residue for the enzymatic activity36. Accordingly, CBS at IC50 concentration exhibited much reduced inhibitory effect on NDM-1-C208A (Fig. 2b). This phenomenon was also noted in the susceptibility test that MIC of MER against NDM-1-C208A producer remained unchanged even in the presence of 256 \u03bcg mL\u22121 CBS (Supplementary Table 3). In consistence with this, the binding capacity of NDM-1-C208A to Bi(III) was reduced significantly with only ca. 0.25 molar equivalents of Bi(III) bound to the mutant as revealed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These results demonstrate that Cys208 in the active site plays a pivotal role on Bi(III) inhibition of NDM-1 activity. By using cellular thermal shift assay, a method to examine the changes in thermal stabilization of targeted protein upon drug binding37,38, we found that supplementation of Bi(III) compounds to the NDM-1-positive bacterial cells led to similar shifts in the protein-melting temperatures (\u0394Tm) by ca. 2 \u00b0C (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5a), while the melting temperature remained almost unchanged upon treatment of bismuth compounds to the NDM-1-C208A mutant strain (Supplementary Fig. 5b), indicative of the importance of Cys208 for the binding of Bi(III) to NDM-1 in cells.",

As shown in Fig. 2d, the addition of increasing concentrations of CBS to native Zn-bound NDM-1 resulted in gradual decreases in the stoichiometry of Zn(II) to NDM-1, accompanied by the increase in the binding stoichiometry of Bi(III) to NDM-1, eventually ca. 2.13 molar equivalents of Zn(II) were displaced, whereas 0.96 molar equivalents of Bi(III) bound to the enzyme. Such a phenomenon is unprecedented, as in most cases, one Bi(III) ion can only displace one Zn(II) ion from an enzyme or a protein39,40. Significantly, inhibition of NDM-1 activity by Bi(III) was essentially irreversible as supplementation of 2 molar equivalents of Zn(II) led to only about 20% activity being restored for Bi-bound NDM-1 owing to the less extent of Bi(III) being replaced by Zn(II) from the enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 6), in contrast to full recovery for apo-NDM-1 (Fig. 2e). Limited proteolysis of purified soluble apo-bound, Zn-bound, or Bi-bound NDM-1 was also performed to explore the impact of Bi(III) on the protein stability of NDM-1. We found that the Bi-bound NDM-1 as well as apo-bound NDM-1 was readily degraded (Supplementary Fig. 7), in contrast to Zn-bound NDM-1, which resisted proteolysis by proteinase K41. Subsequently, we examined the change in enzyme kinetics of NDM-1 by varying the Bi(III) concentration. The addition of Bi(III) resulted in a decrease of the apparent Vmax from 0.900 to 0.365 \u00b5M s\u22121 when Bi(III) concentration increased from 0 to 1.5 \u00b5M. The relevant Lineweaver Burk plot indicates either a typical non-competitive or an irreversible inhibition (Fig. 2f).",

            "text": "The molecular mechanism of inhibition of MBLs by Bi(III) compounds was further investigated by X-ray crystallography. Attempts on direct co-crystallization of Bi-bound form of NDM-1 were not successful due to the amorphous precipitant that readily formed under virtually all of the crystallization conditions examined, and thus crystal soaking with CBS was used. We first crystallized and determined the high-resolution native NDM-1 structure at 0.95 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 8), the highest resolution obtained so far. To facilitate the diffusion of Bi(III) ions into the crystal lattice, Zn(II) ions from the native NDM-1 crystals were removed by immersing the crystals in a pool of cryo-solution containing the metal-chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). The binding of Bi(III) to the protein was confirmed by X-ray excitation spectrum, which showed only the excitation peak for bismuth at around 10.8 keV, but not for the zinc peak at around 8.6 keV (Supplementary Fig. 9). Two data sets were collected for each Bi-bound crystal, one at the peak position (0.92 \u00c5) and the other at the remote position (0.93 \u00c5) of bismuth absorption edge. Both data sets showed clear anomalous peaks at the active site of NDM-1 with the anomalous peak for the data set collected at 0.92 \u00c5 being more significant, indicative of the presence of Bi(III) in the crystal lattice. As shown in Fig. 3a, no significant overall conformational changes were observed between the Bi-bound and Zn-bound NDM-1 (rmsd of 0.18 \u00c5 over all Ca), while only subtle conformational changes were observed at the active site (Fig. 3b\u2013d). Structural refinement using the anomalous signal showed that Bi(III) exhibited two alternative conformations at the active site. The Bi(III) is located between the two Zn(II) ions slightly closer to the Zn1 site of native NDM-1 structure as the major conformation with an occupancy of 0.5. Apart from residues that coordinate to Zn1 (His120 and His189), Cys208 as well as Asp124 that originally bind to Zn2 are also involved in Bi(III) coordination, together with a water molecule forming a trigonal prismatic geometry (Fig. 3b). Bi(III) is located slightly near the Zn2 site of native NDM-1 structure in the minor conformation with much less tendency (an occupancy of only 0.1) (Supplementary Fig. 10), for which Bi(III) coordinates to His250, Cys208, Asp124, and a water molecule, forming a distorted tetrahedral geometry (Supplementary Table 4). The bond lengths of Bi(III) with the side chains of amino acids are overall longer than those for Zn(II) in general (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5), in consistence with the larger ionic radius of Bi(III) (1.03 \u00c5) than Zn(II) (0.74 \u00c5). The crystallographic data are in agreement with our biophysical characterization that one Bi(III) ion replaces two Zn(II), and Cys208 is crucial for Bi(III) binding to NDM-1.",

            "text": "In spite of clinical application for the treatment of H. pylori-associated diseases, bismuth drugs such as CBS (De-Nol\u00ae) and RBC (Pylorid\u00ae) confer no resistance even after use for a long period of time. Importantly, the combination of bismuth drugs with antibiotics significantly increases the eradication rate of drug-resistant H. pylori31,42. This is contributable to its capability of targeting multiple biological pathways43,44, a typical feature of metallo-agents. Such unique properties might endow the potency of Bi(III) compounds to cope with resistance issue. To assess whether Bi(III) compounds exhibit such a resistance-proof characteristic in MBL-positive bacteria i.e., NDM-HK, mutant prevention concentration (MPC) was determined for MER in the absence and presence of different concentrations of CBS. We found that MER alone was unable to kill all high-level resistant mutants even at 16-fold MIC (MPC = 32 folds of MIC). In contrast, with the increase in CBS concentration, the number of mutant colonies declined significantly as shown in the heat map (Fig. 4a). The observed mutation frequency ranged from 1.31 \u00d7 10\u22127 to 9.84 \u00d7 10\u221210 (Supplementary Table 6). However, no such reduction in mutant colonies was noted for the NDM-1-negative strain, NDM-HK PCV (Fig. 4b). The MER MPC was lowered to 2-fold MIC against NDM-HK when \u2265128 \u00b5g mL\u22121 CBS or \u226564 \u00b5g mL\u22121 Bi(NAC)3 were used (Fig. 4c left bars and Supplementary Fig. 11b). In contrast, less mutation prevention was observed for CBS in NDM-HK PCV (Fig. 4c, right bars). Although hyperproduction of NDM-1 was noted (as shown in the inset of Fig. 4d), the combination therapy significantly suppressed the evolution of high-level resistance over a period of 20 passages of NDM-HK (Fig. 4d). No such phenomenon was observed for NDM-HK PCV, implying that mutation prevention of NDM-1-positive bacteria by Bi(III) compounds is attributed to the inhibition of NDM-1 enzyme. Indeed, a MIC of 32 \u03bcg mL\u22121 in the presence of 256 \u03bcg mL\u22121 CBS vs 512 \u03bcg mL\u22121 in the absence of CBS was found for MER against NDM-1-overexpressing E. coli Rosetta cells (NDM-Rosetta OX in Supplementary Table 3), confirming the ability of CBS to restore antibiotic activity against bacteria with hyper-production of NDM-1. Considering the low toxicity of CBS in humans and the acceptable mutation frequency, the combination of an antibiotic and CBS should have potential therapeutic applications.",

The infected mice were then administrated with a vehicle control, MER or CBS monotherapy or combination therapy, 4 h post infection, followed by twice-daily treatment via i.p. injection (Fig. 4f). For the monotherapy, CBS failed to protect any of the mice from death within 48 h. Half of the mice in MER group also died the next day post infection, and at the endpoint of the experiment MER rescued two of the eight mice. However, in a pre-experiment, MER at an identical dose cured all the mice infected with a lethal dose of NDM-HK PCV (Supplementary Fig. 13). In contrast, the combination therapy effectively postponed the death of mice and led to an increase in mice survival rate to 50%. Additionally, no bacterial clots were observed by direct visual inspection of the infection site in the dissected mice receiving combination therapy (Supplementary Fig. 14). Similar results were obtained in a murine peritonitis model without mucin, in which 40% mice survived for up to 86 h when MER and CBS were co-administrated (Supplementary Fig. 15). Taken together, we demonstrate that the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the combination of MER with CBS could be effectively converted into in vivo efficacy.",

Different from other heavy metal ions, bismuth drugs exhibit negligible toxicity in humans, attributable to glutathione, and multidrug-resistant protein-mediated disposal in humans but not in pathogens49. The currently accepted therapeutic daily doses of CBS in Europe deliver approximately 480 mg equivalents of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) for up to 8 weeks50. No intoxication has been documented with CBS at its recommended dosage in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, and no other serious adverse effects have been associated with CBS51. Our combined data show that a battery of Bi(III) compounds including CBS inhibit NDM-1, VIM-2, and IMP-4 at micromolar levels, and excitingly exhibit a synergy upon co-treatment with MER to resistant strains as reflected by the FICI values of 0.05\u20130.4 and significant decreases in MICs (Tables 1 and 2). The activity of MER can be restored to the level similar to those for sensitive strains. The higher activity of Bi(NAC)3 toward MBLs-positive bacteria may provide a rationale to further develop more potent Bi(III) compounds by complexation of Bi(III) with ligands that could increase Bi(III) uptake, as well as possess high affinity toward chelation of Zn(II) at the same time.",

Moreover, the active site of NDM-1 is located in a shallow groove encompassed by several loops with Zn(II) coordinating residues52, which confers conformational flexibility of these residues for efficient substrate binding and catalysis turnover. In consistence with thiolphilic nature of bismuth44, cysteine (Cys208) is critical for binding of Bi(III) as revealed by mutagenesis studies (e.g., Cys208 to Ala208), as well as the crystal structure which shows that Cys208 is involved in binding of Bi(III) in both conformations. Most organic MBL inhibitors inactivate the enzyme through binding to the substrate site of specific type of MBLs19,22, such inhibitors are unlikely to be developed as broad-spectrum inhibitors of MBLs given the structural diversity of the enzymes at the active sites. In contrast, Bi(III) compounds inactivate the enzyme through replacement of Zn(II) by Bi(III) ion via the critical residue of cysteine at the active site. Based on the unique mechanism employed by Bi(III) to inactivate NDM-1, we strongly suggest that Bi(III) compounds can serve as a broad-spectrum inhibitor for B1 class of MBLs, although only NDM-1, VIM-2, and IMP-4 were selected as showcase studies (Table 2). As for mono-zinc (II) B2 class of MBLs, a cysteine is found in the active sites; however, it remains to be seen whether it is accessible for Bi(III) and how fast such Bi(III)-Zn(II) exchange could be given the structural rigid nature of this class of MBLs in their active sites53. It may warrant further investigation to see whether Bi(III) compounds also inhibit B2 and B3 classes of MBLs.",

This may be due to the reduced use of MER in the combination and/or reduced protein levels of NDM-1 when bacterial cells were treated with CBS (Supplementary Fig. 7). Nevertheless, the MICs of MER still raised at the end of passage compared to that of original strain (control) owing to the hyperproduction of NDM-1 as confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 4d). Whether this is due to mutations in the promoter region of the gene and/or high copy numbers of plasmids carrying the bla gene may warrant further studies in future.",

Here we enlist bismuth drugs for combatting such carbapenem-resistant systemic infection in vivo. Notably, peritoneal co-administration of CBS (at a comparable dose to current FDA-approved human dose (8 mg/kg)58) boosts the effectiveness of MER, leading to increased mouse survival time and reduced mortality of mouse infected with highly lethal NDM-HK (Fig. 4f). However, not all mice survived eventually, possibly due to limited studies on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bismuth drugs under such circumstances. Nevertheless, our robust in vitro and preliminary in vivo results provide solid foundation on the development of Bi(III) or other metallodrugs as antibiotic adjuvants to treat infection caused by MBL-producing bacteria in a wider clinical context. For example, Bi(III) is known to preferentially accumulate in kidney59, and the local high concentration of Bi(III) may render better therapeutic effect in mouse kidney or urinary tract infection models. Moreover, as an approved drug, CBS will render a more rapid and economic route into clinical trials and even to patents, if successful.",

Distinct from previously reported organic molecule-based inhibitors, Bi(III) irreversibly inhibits MBLs via a unique metal displacement mechanism, with the cysteine residues at the active site being critical for bismuth coordination. We thus anticipate that CBS or other bismuth compounds can be repositioned or developed as a new class of broad-spectrum inhibitors for B1 MBLs. Given that Bi(III) compounds are already clinically used drugs and their selective toxicity toward pathogens. Such broad-spectrum MBL inhibitors together with antibiotics as co-therapy will undoubtedly open a new horizon for the treatment of infection caused by MBL-positive bacteria. Indeed, combined use of such resistant breakers with existing antibiotics represents a new and more economical therapy to effectively solve the problem of antibiotic resistance60.",

The concentration that restricted the growth of mutant colonies was determined as MPC. In an identical experiment, the higher-level resistant mutant colonies were enumerated. The relative mutation frequency at each MIC for each strain/antibiotic pair was calculated as the proportion of resistant colonies per inoculum.",

About 1.0 \u00d7 105 MDCK cells were seeded per well in 24-well plates and incubated as described above for 48 h to ensure confluency. Logarithmic cultures of NDM-HK were washed with PBS for three times and re-suspended in MEM/10% FBS resulting in the initial bacterial density of about 2.0 \u00d7 107 CFU mL\u22121. Then, 500 \u03bcL of bacterial suspension were added to each well and substituted for the previous MDCK culture medium. The plates were centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 10 min and then incubated for another 6 h, executing the bacterial infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 200. We then used two infection models for examination, viz, the cell-associated bacterial infection and cell-invaded bacterial infection. The cell-associated bacteria are herein defined as bacteria that attach to, penetrate, or transcytose in MDCK cells, while the cell-invaded bacteria are defined as bacteria that penetrate or transcytose MDCK cells. For the cell-invaded infection, the infected cells were incubated in culture medium supplemented with ciprofloxacin (100 \u00b5g mL\u22121) for 1 h to remove extracellular bacteria. Then, the treated cells were washed vigorously with PBS for six times and replenished with culture medium. For the cell-associated infection, the infected cells were only washed vigorously with PBS for six times to remove unbound bacteria. The infected MDCK cells were then exposed to either MER or CBS, or their combination for overnight under identical cell culture condition. Cells in the absence of drugs served as a control. The bacterial loads were examined by lysing MDCK cells with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and serially diluting the resulting lysates to enumerate bacterial colonies by agar plating. The assay was performed in triplicate, repeated three times, and results were expressed as average \u00b1 SD.",
