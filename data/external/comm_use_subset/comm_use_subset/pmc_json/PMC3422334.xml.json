            "text": "Rapid progress and improvement in molecular technologies have allowed researchers to switch from the traditional approaches of virus detection in clinical samples to multiplexing for simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single assay. A number of different PCR based assays for detection and discovery of multiple pathogens have been developed [1]\u2013[4]. Detection microarrays are proven to be useful in the identification and discovery of viruses homologous to known species. They have been used to guide the selection of samples for further analysis by sequencing [1]\u2013[3], [5]. However, microarrays based on nucleic acid hybridization are too complex in design and performance for the routine donors testing, and exhibit a comparatively low sensitivity of detection, usually around 100\u22121,000 genome copies of target virus per analyzed sample [1]\u2013[2]. Several PCR based assays coupled with oligonucleotide microarray technology (so called re-sequencing arrays) have been designed to allow simultaneous detection or genotyping of a target group of viruses, such as some critical blood-borne pathogens (3 viruses) [6], respiratory viruses (16\u201321 viruses) [7]\u2013[8], and respiratory adenoviruses (6 different serotypes) [9]. Such PCR based approach allows increasing the sensitivity of detection down to 10\u2013100 copies of the target RNA or DNA in a sample.",

Some of the listed viruses are included to the required DE testing for tissue transplantation. Besides, historically, some of the targeted viruses have been found to be allograft-transmitted to recipients [11]\u2013[12]. In the present study, a real-time PCR array with SYBR-Green chemistry targeting these eight viral pathogens listed above was developed and evaluated with analytical and clinical panels. The array demonstrated acceptable performance in the testing with both analytical panels and donors\u2019 clinical samples.",

The 17 clinical plasma samples positive for HBV, HCV or HIV-1 used in this study were existing clinical diagnostic samples kept in NIH Blood Bank. Information of these left over samples had been recorded in such a manner that subjects can not be identified, directly or through identifiers. The written informed consent from the participants was waived under 45 CFR 46.101 (b) (4). The six plasma samples positive for HIV-1 were estimated to contain 50 to \u223c90,000 genome copy numbers per ml; six plasma samples positive for HCV were estimated to contain 780 to \u223c123,000 genome copy number/ml and five plasma samples positive for HBV were estimated to contain \u223c150 to 16,000 copy number/ml. The copy numbers of viruses in these samples were provided by the NIH Blood Bank. No information about the subtypes or genotypes of these viruses was available. The amount of each clinical sample was sufficient to be tested only once by the PCR array in the study.

All primers were checked for potential dimer formation using \u201cPrimer Express\u201d software (version 3.0, Applied Biosystems). After design, all primers were again checked using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to avoid any cross-reactivity with other species. Newly designed and previously published primer sets adapted for the final version of the real-time PCR array are listed in Table 1.

Some previously published primers designed for PCR detection of the target viruses were also adapted and evaluated. Overall, a total of 120 primers were initially designed using specific criteria for the current real-time PCR array (see Materials and Methods) to cover the eight targeted viruses: HIV-1, HIV-2, HBV, HCV, HTLV-1, HTLV -2, WNV, and VACV.

This panel contained three different isolates from each subtype (A to G) of HIV-1 group M, three isolates from HIV-1 group O, one isolate from HIV-1 group N and three different isolates of HIV-2. The infectious dose of each HIV isolate in the panel was determined by TCID50 (median tissue culture infective dose) titration and the dose of virus used in each PCR reaction was calculated. The results of testing of HIV-1 specific primers are shown in Figure 1. In this experiment we evaluated the coverage of HIV-1 variants and estimated the relative sensitivity of the four HIV-1 specific primer sets based on cycle threshold (C(t)) values obtained with each isolate tested. Two primer sets targeting the conserved pol regions (NP170/171 and NP175/174) were able to detect most of the HIV-1 subtypes with a high sensitivity (C(t) = 15\u201325). Only one primer set (NP175/174) detected both the group N isolate and all three isolates of group O with Ct = 20\u201335. We did not detect cross-reactivity of HIV-1 or HIV-2 specific primers with the other type of HIV. All three HIV-2 isolates studied (1\u20133 log10 TCID50/PCR input) were detected with all HIV-2 specific primer sets with a low Ct value: 12\u201320 (data not shown).",
