            "text": "To achieve successful infection enveloped viruses need to fuse with a host cell membrane to deliver the viral genome into the host cell. Some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, Sendai virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, appear to be capable of direct fusion at the plasma membrane after initial attachment [1]\u2013[5]. However, the majority of enveloped viruses use endocytosis for uptake and transport prior to fusion. Since endocytic cargo may eventually end up in the destructive environment of the lysosome, environmental cues are crucial to trigger viral fusion at the right stage of trafficking. These triggers, which may include a decrease in pH, changes in redox environment, and proteolytic activity [6]\u2013[8], induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to the merger of viral and host membranes. Two well-studied viruses; influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), are known to undergo fusion upon exposure to low pH [9]\u2013[12]. Other enveloped viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Ebola virus, require proteolytic processing of their viral fusion proteins in the endosomal system for fusion to occur [13]\u2013[16].",

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known as major causes of the common cold (e.g. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43). However, the emergence of new HCoVs of zoonotic origin has shown the potential of CoVs to cause life-threatening disease in humans as was demonstrated during the 2002/2003 SARS-CoV epidemics and more recently for MERS-CoV in the Middle East [17], [18]. The well-studied mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is often used as a safe model to study CoV infections.",

Trimers of the CoV S protein, a type I membrane protein belonging to the class I fusion proteins, form the peplomers that protrude from the virion surface [20]. The S protein can be divided into two functional subunits.

Also feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) was suggested to enter via a clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytic route [23], [24]. For the HCoV-229E a caveolae-dependent endocytic uptake has been suggested [25]. Although the ability of MHV S proteins to cause cell-cell fusion at a neutral pH was initially interpreted as an indication for fusion of virions at the cell surface, more recent studies indicate the requirement for clathrin-mediated endocytosis for entry of MHV [26]\u2013[29]. However, while some studies report that MHV strain A59 is sensitive to lysosomotropic agents that affect endocytosis [26], this is not the case according to others [27].",

Different cleavage sites have been identified for different CoVs, the importance of which seems to differ for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion. Some CoV S proteins, including that of MHV strain A59, are cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary by furin(-like) proteases during transport of the newly assembled virions through the secretory pathway of the producer cell [30]\u2013[33]. Inhibition of this S protein cleavage was shown to inhibit cell-cell fusion, but not to affect entry of MHV strain A59 into host cells [30], [34], [35]. MHV strain 2 contains an S protein that is not cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary. Interestingly, although MHV strains 2 and A59 were both reported to enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, entry of MHV 2 but not of MHV A59, was blocked by inhibitors of low-pH activated cathepsin proteases [27], [36]. Inhibitors of cathepsin proteases have also been shown to inhibit entry of SARS-CoV and feline CoVs [23], [37], [38], while treatment of cell-bound virus particles with different proteases was shown to enhance virus entry and/or cell-cell fusion [27], [34], [39]\u2013[45]. For SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), it appears that a proteolytic cleavage of the S protein at a more downstream position than the S1/S2 boundary upon receptor binding is of importance for cell entry [40], [43], [46]\u2013[49].",

Using siRNA gene silencing, we found that the prototypic coronavirus MHV strain A59 (further referred to as MHV) requires proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion for efficient infection of cells. By using recombinant MHVs expressing reporter genes as well as by applying a novel, replication-independent fusion assay we confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and demonstrated that trafficking of MHV virions to lysosomal compartments and processing of the S protein by lysosomal proteases was required for productive entry to occur. Our results indicate that a cleavage site in the S protein of CoVs immediately upstream of the FP determines the site of fusion. In agreement herewith FIPV, which requires processing by lysosomal proteases, was also shown to depend on trafficking to lysosomes. In contrast, MERS-CoV, which contains a minimal furin-cleavage site consensus sequence in the S protein immediately upstream of the FP, was negatively affected by inhibition of furin, but not of lysosomal proteases.",

To validate these findings these proteins were subjected to a follow-up analysis using siRNA-mediated gene silencing with oligonucleotides from a different supplier than the one used for the initial RNAi screen (Fig. 1A). The follow-up analysis included ACTR2 and ACTR3, two major constituents of the Arp2/3 complex which are important for the formation of actin branches and cell surface protrusions, as well as for the motility of several pathogens inside host cells (reviewed in [51], [52]). Also selected were the RAS-related GTP-binding protein family members, RAB7A and RAB7B, which have been shown to be involved in endosomal maturation (reviewed in [53]). RAB7 interacts amongst others with members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, involved in late endosome to lysosome maturation. The HOPS subunit VPS39 (reviewed in [54]) was also found to be a strong hit in the siRNA screen and therefore selected. Other proteins included SNX1, involved in retrograde transport of cargo between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (reviewed in [55]), VCL, inter alia involved in connecting the Arp2/3 complex with integrins during actin polymerization (reviewed in [56]), and the Ser/Thr-protein kinase PAK1, which is activated by the Rho/Rac/Cdc42 family and is implicated in a variety of downstream effects including modulation of the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in [57]).",

After 8 h of infection cells were collected and GFP expression by the replication of MHV was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). As controls siRNAs silencing GFP and negative-control siRNAs were used. A hit from the screen was considered as confirmed when transfection with at least two out three independent siRNAs resulted in significant reduction in MHV-driven GFP expression relative to the negative-control siRNAs. siRNA-mediated gene silencing of ACTR2 and ACTR3 resulted in reduced infections for all three siRNAs, indicating that actin branching is important for MHV infection (Figure 1A, dark orange). Also the importance of the RAB7A, RAB7B and VPS39 proteins, involved in late-endosome and late-endosome to lysosome maturation, for MHV infection could be confirmed (Figure 1A, turquoise and light green). The importance of SNX1, VCL and PAK1 for infection of HeLa cells with MHV could not be confirmed (Figure 1A, grey). The latter three genes were not studied any further. To validate our transfection protocol and confirm the efficacies of the siRNAs at the mRNA level, quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed. All siRNAs used reduced the corresponding mRNA levels with 75\u201395% (Figure 1B). siRNAs targeting RAB7A were shown to inhibit the expression of a RAB7a-fusion protein (Figure S1 in Text S1).",

Again, proteins were considered important for infection with MHV when transfection with at least two out three independent siRNAs resulted in significant reduction in MHV-driven GFP expression relative to the negative-control siRNAs. siRNA-mediated downregulation of proteins involved in caveolae-mediated endocytosis revealed that CAV2, but not the other proteins analyzed are important for infection with MHV (Figure 1C, light blue). Downregulation of most proteins associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibited MHV infection, including DNM1, DNM2, CLTC, and DAB2. siRNA-mediated silencing of EPS15 or AAK1, accessory factors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, did not affect MHV replication (Figure 1C, dark blue). Silencing of early endosome-associated genes (EEA1, RAB5A, RAB5B, and RAB5C; Figure 1C, cerulean) each decreased replication-mediated GFP expression. While downregulation of MYO6, involved in actin-based motility, did not influence MHV infection (Figure 1C, dark orange), our results indicate that the microtubule-associated motility proteins DYNC1H1 and DYNC2H1 are important for infection with MHV (Figure 1C, orange). Silencing of NSF, required for transport from early to late endosomes [58], or of the HOPS subunits VPS11 and VPS41, which are involved in late endosome to lysosome maturation (Reviewed in [54]), all resulted in severely reduced MHV infection (Figure 1C, turquoise and light green, respectively).",

MHV infection was not affected by addition of the solvents, whereas both MG132 and BrefA severely decreased luciferase expression regardless of the time of addition. Inhibition of endosome maturation with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), or Chloroquine (Chloq) severely diminished luciferase expression when the inhibitors were added prior to infection. Much smaller effects were observed when these drugs were added at 2 hpi, indicating that the inhibitors mainly affect MHV entry (Figure 2, deep sky blue). Similar effects were observed with known inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis; Chlorpromazine (Chlopro), Monensin (Mon), Dynasore, and Dyngo-4A (Dyngo). All these compounds strongly decreased MHV replication-mediated luciferase expression when added early but not when added at 2 hpi (Figure 2, dark blue). The actin- and macropinocytosis-affecting drug EIPA, which inhibits the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1, led to reduced luciferase expression both when added prior to and after entry of MHV at 2 hpi. Actin cytoskeleton altering drugs Latrunculin A (LatA), Jasplakinolide (Jasp), Cytochalasin B (CytoB), and Cytochalasin D (CytoD), or the inducer of microtubule depolymerization Nocodazole (Noc) only decreased MHV infection when added early, indicating a role for the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton in entry but not RNA replication (Figure 2, dark orange and orange). Likewise U18666A, a cholesterol transport-affecting agent, which also prevents maturation of late endosomes [62], had a strong inhibitory effect on MHV infection when added early (Figure 2, turquoise).

However, assays based on reporter gene expression driven by virus replication do not allow discrimination between virus entry and RNA replication when analyzing siRNAs or agents that also affect RNA synthesis. To unequivocally demonstrate the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosome maturation for MHV entry, we therefore made use of a fusion assay we recently developed [63]. The assay is based on minimal complementation of defective \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-galactosidase \u0394M15) with the short \u03b1-peptide [64]. MHV-\u03b1N, a recombinant MHV containing an N protein tagged with the \u03b1-peptide (\u03b1N), is used to infect \u0394M15\u2212fragment expressing target cells. Upon fusion of the virion with a host cell membrane \u03b1N is released into the cytoplasm resulting in complementation of the defective \u03b2-galactosidase thereby reconstituting a functional enzyme. Conversion of the non-fluorescent substrate fluorescein-di-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (FDG) by \u03b2-galactosidase into green fluorophores fluorescein (FIC) can be measured by FACS or fluorescence microscopy (Figure S2 in Text S1).",

The fusion assay showed that silencing of neither CAV1 nor CAV2 affected MHV fusion (Figure 3A, light blue), even though reduction of CAV2 was shown to affect MHV infection (Figure 1C). However, downregulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis associated proteins DNM2 and CLTC lead to strongly decreased fusion, as did the lack of early endosome-associated factors RAB5B and RAB5C (Figure 3A, dark blue and cerulean, respectively). Fusion was also affected by RNAi-mediated reduction of actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins ACTR2 and ACTR3 (Figure 3A, dark orange), proteins known to be involved in late endosome (RAB7A, RAB7B) and late endosome-to-lysosome maturation (VPS11, VPS39, and VPS41) (Figure 3A, turquoise and light green).",

After pre-loading with FDG, cells were pre-treated with the inhibitors for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, after which cells were inoculated with MHV-\u03b1N in the presence of the agents, and analyzed by FACS as described above. As controls we included protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), MHV fusion inhibitor peptide HR2 (HR2, [20]), MG132 and BrefA. Fusion of MHV was not affected by the solvents or CHX, the latter confirming that this assay is independent of RNA replication and protein synthesis. MHV fusion was barely affected by replication inhibitor BrefA, whereas MG132 had a clear negative effect, in agreement with the conclusion drawn previously that MG132 inhibits entry of MHV as well as RNA synthesis [61]. Inhibition of endosomal maturation by NH4Cl, BafA1 and Chloq (Figure 3B, deep sky blue) or of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by Chlopro, Mon, and Dynasore (Figure 3B, dark blue) severely inhibited MHV fusion. Disturbance of the actin cytoskeleton by EIPA or by LatA, CytoB, or CytoD reduced fusion by 75\u201380% (Figure 3B, dark orange), while interference with microtubule polymerization by Noc had a smaller effect (Figure 3B, orange). Late endosomal maturation arrest caused by U18666A reduced fusion to approximately 10% (Figure 3B, turquoise). In conclusion, the replication-independent fusion assay confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and of endosome maturation for entry of MHV. The data indicate that late endosome-to-lysosome maturation is required for efficient entry and fusion.",

To this end, sucrose density gradient-purified MHV virus was covalently labeled with the low-pH resistant dye DyLight 488 (MHV-DL488). HeLa-mCC1a cells were transfected with plasmids to express monomeric RFP (mRFP) fusion proteins of RAB5, RAB7, or LAMP1. At 24 h post transfection, MHV-DL488 was bound to cells at 4\u00b0C for 90 min. Inoculation medium was replaced by warm medium containing trypan blue, which immediately shifts the emission spectrum of surface bound particles rendering them undetectable in the 505\u2013530 nm channel unless they get endocytosed [65]. Cells were imaged using a spinning-disc confocal microscope acquiring z-stacks in 30 s intervals over 10 min time frames from 10\u201370 min post warming. Only low-level RFP fusion protein expressing cells were selected for analysis. Interestingly, MHV particles newly appeared even 60 min post warming, in agreement with the notion that MHV enters in an unsynchronized manner (unpublished results). Co-localization and co-trafficking of viruses with endosomal compartments was assessed by detecting virus particles based on size and intensity (green channel) and by measuring the underlying intensity in the red channel (endosomal vesicles). MHV virions were found to co-localize with all three endosomal compartments (Fig. 4A). Whereas newly entering/appearing particles were always co-localizing with RAB5 molecules, they only associated with RAB7 and LAMP1 containing vesicles at later time points.",

A virion was categorized as associating with a certain endosomal marker only if this co-localization was observed over at least four sequential 30 s interval images. When the initial co-localization was lost, but the virion did not disappear, this virion was classified as associating/dissociating. Complete disappearance of a virus particle (including in other z-stacks) while immediately previously co-localizing with an endosomal marker was categorized as a fusion event (Figures S3 and S4 in Text S1). When a viral particle co-localized with endosomal compartments but did neither dissociate nor fade during the 10 min acquisition period it was classified as non-fusing. With this quantification method we analyzed 75\u2013100 virions in total for each of the endosomal compartment types studied. The fraction of virions not fusing during the acquisition period was consistently found to be at around 10\u201315%. We observed that all of the entering MHV particles initially co-localized with RAB5-positive early endosomal vesicles and that most virions dissociated (were no longer co-localized) after 4\u20136 min. Notably, it appeared that in these events the RAB5 marker faded rather than moved away. Only a very small percentage of virions were categorized as fusing while in early endosomes. The number of fusion events was much higher for virions co-localizing with RAB7 or LAMP1 (Figure 4B), indicating that most virions fuse in late endosomes or lysosomes.",

We hypothesized that these compartments provide the environmental cues required for productive virus-cell fusion. In order to analyze to what extent the low pH in the endosomal system is required for entry of MHV, we analyzed the inhibition of MHV entry at different concentrations of BafA1. While high concentrations of BafA1 (as used for the results shown in Fig. 2 and 3) affect endosomal maturation, at low concentrations this inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase only elevates the pH of endosomal compartments but does not affect endosomal trafficking per se\n[66]. We made use of that property and tested the sensitivity of MHV to BafA1 side by side with the control viruses VSV and IAV. VSV has been described to fuse at pH 6.2 in early and/or late endosomes [9], [11], [12], [67]\u2013[69], while IAV has been shown to fuse in late endosomes at an even lower pH [9], [10], [70]. HeLa or HeLa-mCC1a cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of BafA1 for 30 min prior to infection with reporter gene expressing viruses: VSV (VSV\u0394G/FLuc-G*; [71], [72]), IAV (IAV-RLuc; [73]), or MHV (MHV-EFLM). Luciferase expression levels indicated that infection of cells with VSV and IAV is much more affected by BafA1, with an IC50 values of 0.80 and 0.63 nM, respectively, compared to MHV, which displays a three to four fold higher IC50 of 2.34 nM (Figure 5A).",

Nevertheless RNAi-mediated silencing of HOPS subunits and treatment of cells with U1866A indicates that late endosome-to-lysosome maturation is required for efficient entry. To confirm and extend these observations, we made use of haploid HAP1 cells lacking a functional HOPS complex resulting from lentiviral-mediated knockout of the VPS33A subunit (H1-\u0394V33 cells; [74]).Both HAP1 cells and H1-\u0394V33 cells were modified to stably express the MHV receptor. As a control, the H1-\u0394V33 cells were in addition stably transfected with FLAG-tagged VPS33A (H1-\u0394V33-fV33). The different cells expressed similar levels of the MHV receptor as determined by FACS analysis (Figure S5 in Text S1). Expression of FLAG-VPS33A was confirmed by Western blot (Figure S6 in Text S1). Functional reconstitution was confirmed by confocal fluorescence imaging of lysosome localization (Figure S7 in Text S1). While in the knockout cells the lysosomes were clustered, the lysosomes were dispersed again throughout the cytoplasm in the FLAG-VPS33A re-transfected cells, as observed in the HAP1 parental cells. The haploid cells were infected with luciferase reporter gene-expressing MHV, VSV, or IAV at low MOI. Cells were lysed at 7 (MHV and VSV) or 16 (IAV) hpi and luciferase expression levels were determined. The lack of a functional HOPS complex had no effect on VSV and IAV infection; however, MHV infection was strongly reduced in the knockout, but not in the re-transfected cells (Figure 5B). These observations confirm the conclusion that late endosome-to-lysosome maturation is required for efficient entry of MHV, a characteristic that is not shared with the pH-sensitive VSV and IAV.",

Hence we analyzed the extent to which different protease inhibitors could inhibit MHV entry. Thus, HeLa-mCC1a-\u0394M15 cells were pretreated for 30 min with the different inhibitors, after which the cells were inoculated with MHV-\u03b1N in inhibitor-containing medium. Cells were collected, loaded with FDG, and FDG conversion to FIC by complementation of \u03b2-galactosidase upon viral fusion was assessed by FACS. Our results indicate that most protease inhibitors tested (Fig. 6) hardly inhibited fusion of MHV, if at all. Exceptions were AEBSF, which has been shown to cause aggregation of early endosomal vesicles [75], and a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor (CPI; cystatin-pepstatin inhibitor) capable of inhibiting the three major protease family members found in lysosomes. Thus, by using CPI we measured the combined effects of an endosomal papain-like cysteine protease inhibitor (PLCP), an aspartyl protease inhibitor, and an asparagine endopeptidase inhibitor (AEP) [76]. From these results we conclude that inhibition of a broad range of endosomal proteases efficiently blocks fusion of MHV, indicating that efficient entry requires the activity of lysosomal proteases.",

            "text": "In general, class I fusion proteins require cleavage just upstream of the FP to render them fusion competent [20], [38], [77]. However, while the S protein of MHV is cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary (Fig. 7A), no protease cleavage site has been identified close to the fusion peptide. In view of the inhibition of MHV entry by the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor CPI and in analogy to other class I fusion proteins, we hypothesized that an additional cleavage in the S protein, immediately upstream of the FP, is necessary to induce fusion. To test this hypothesis, we introduced an optimal furin cleavage site (FCS) by substituting three amino acids by Arg (AIRGR\u2192RRRRR) immediately upstream of a highly conserved Arg (indicated in bold) that occurs just N-terminal of the FP. Recombinant MHV carrying this FCS in its S2 subunit was designated MHV-S2\u2032FCS. (Figure 7A). Western blot analysis of the S protein of a purified stock of this virus using an antibody recognizing the S2 subunit showed no evidence of cleavage at the newly introduced FCS (S2\u2032 site). Apparently, cleavage at this position does not occur during virus production (Figure S8 in Text S1). MHV carrying wild type or mutant S proteins displayed similar growth kinetics (Figure S9 A and B in Text S1). Next we analyzed whether the introduced FCS affected the sensitivity of the recombinant MHV to CPI, which does not exhibit inhibitory activity towards furin. Thus, HeLa-mCC1a cells were pretreated with CPI for 30 min and subsequently infected with wild type S (MHV-EFLM) or mutant S (MHV-S2\u2032FCS) containing viruses expressing luciferase reporter genes in the presence of the protease inhibitor. At 7 hpi the cells were lysed and viral-replication dependent luciferase expression levels were determined. Introduction of the FCS resulted in the recombinant virus being no longer sensitive to inhibition by lysosomal proteases (Figure 7B), probably because the S protein is now cleaved by furin in an endocytic compartment.",

After pretreatment of MHV receptor-expressing HAP1, H1-\u0394V33, and H1-\u0394V33-fV33A cells with furin inhibitor (FI) or mock treatment, cells were inoculated with MHV-EFLM or mutant virus MHV-S2\u2032FCS in presence or absence of FI. At 7 hpi the cells were lysed and viral-replication dependent luciferase expression levels were determined. In agreement with previous results (Fig. 5), infection with MHV carrying a wild type S was severely reduced in cells lacking a functional HOPS complex and addition of the FI did not alter this effect (Figure 8, red bars). In contrast, infection with MHV-S2\u2032FCS was not decreased by the lack of a functional HOPS complex. However, FI treatment had a clearly negative effect on this virus, which was much more dramatic in the absence of a functional HOPS complex in H1-\u0394V33 cells (Figure 8, blue). In conclusion, MHV-S2\u2032FCS lost the requirement for a functional HOPS complex in parallel with this virus becoming insensitive to the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor CPI. In contrast to the virus with the wild type S, the mutant virus became sensitive to inhibition of furin cleavage.",

Therefore, HeLa-mCC1a-\u0394M15 cells were transfected with each of three different siRNAs per gene for 72 h, after which they were infected with wild type (MHV-EFLM) or mutant (MHV-S2\u2032FCS) S protein containing MHV. At 7 hpi the cells were lysed and viral-replication dependent luciferase expression levels were determined. As found previously (Fig. 1), infection with wild type S protein carrying MHV was reduced after gene silencing of RAB5, RAB7, VPS11, and VPS41 (Figure 9, red bars). On the other hand, infection with MHV-S2\u2032FCS was significantly diminished by downregulation of the early endosomal proteins RAB5B and RAB5C, but not of the late endosomal proteins RAB7A and RAB7B or the HOPS complex components VPS11 and VPS41 (Figure 9, blue bars). Consistently, infections with MHV carrying wild type or mutant S protein were equally blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis whereas the virus with the mutant S (MHV-S2\u2032FCS) was much less sensitive to inhibitors of endosomal maturation, including BafA1, or to perturbants of the actin cytoskeleton (Figure S10 in Text S1). From these results we conclude that introduction of a FCS immediately upstream of the FP abolishes the requirement for trafficking of virions to lysosomes and for processing by lysosomal proteases. The resulting virus, which still depends on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, now requires furin cleavage for efficient entry, the enzymes for which occur earlier in the endocytic pathway [78].",

The fusion peptide sequence was found to be highly conserved amongst the different coronaviruses. Also an Arginine residue immediately upstream of the predicted fusion peptide is highly conserved with the exception of FIPV (serotype II). Interestingly, MERS-CoV and IBV-Beaudette contain a minimal furin cleavage site Arg-X-X-Arg just upstream of the fusion peptide (Figure 10A). In analogy with the results obtained with FCS-mutant MHV, we predicted that FIPV and MERS-CoV would differ in their protease inhibitor sensitivity and lysosomal trafficking requirements.

To test this prediction, Huh-7 cells were pretreated with FI or the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor CPI for 30 min. Cells were subsequently inoculated with MERS-CoV at a MOI of 0.1 in the presence of these inhibitors. At 8 hpi the cells were fixed and the number of infected cells determined using immunocytochemistry and wide-field microscopy. The results indicate that, in contrast to wild type MHV and FIPV, but similarly to recombinant MHV carrying a FCS immediately upstream of the FP, infection with MERS-CoV is strongly inhibited by the FI but not by CPI (Figure 11), indicating that MERS-CoV does not require trafficking to lysosomes for efficient entry. Based on these results we conclude that the cleavage site in the CoV S protein immediately upstream of the FP is a key determinant of the intracellular site of fusion.",

By using a replication-independent fusion assay, we confirmed that MHV entry requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis despite the well-known ability of the MHV S protein to cause cell-cell fusion at neutral pH. We demonstrate that MHV particles traffic to and fuse in lysosomes. Yet, MHV is much less sensitive to perturbation of the low pH in the endo-/lysosomal system than low pH-dependent control viruses VSV and IAV. Our results additionally indicate that, for fusion to occur, the S protein of MHV requires proteolytic cleavage immediately upstream of the FP, like other class I fusion proteins. Efficient inhibition of MHV entry was only observed using a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, and could not be achieved using more specific protease inhibitors. Introduction of an optimal furin cleavage site in the S protein immediately upstream of the FP abolished the requirement for trafficking of virions to lysosomes for fusion. However, this virus still required clathrin-mediated uptake for efficient entry. Consistent with a common mechanism for the entry of CoVs, FIPV, but not MERS-CoV, the latter of which contains a furin cleavage site immediately upstream of the FP, was shown to require trafficking to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases for efficient entry. Based on these results we propose a model in which the cleavage site immediately upstream of the FP is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of CoV fusion (Figure 12).",

One of these was siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Although - with the exception of RAB7A - knockdown was not monitored at the protein level, we believe this approach firmly demonstrates the importance of novel host factors for several reasons. Validated siRNAs were used and the experimental conditions were confirmed by analyzing the mRNA expression levels of several genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, we made use of three independent siRNAs per target gene, and a target was only classified as a hit when at least two out three siRNAs showed the same phenotype. Importantly, our findings were strengthened by targeting multiple proteins per host cell pathway/complex, each time with very similar results. Moreover, hits obtained with the replication-dependent reporter assays were confirmed with our novel replication-independent enzyme complementation entry assay. Also the use of recombinant viruses differing only in their spike proteins enabled us to show that inhibition of virus infection upon siRNA transfection resulted from differences in virus entry and not virus replication. Finally, the results obtained were corroborated by using a large panel of inhibitors and by making use of haploid knockout cells, in which late endosome-to-lysosome trafficking was inhibited.",

Endocytic uptake is also required for a mutant virus carrying a S protein with a FCS immediately upstream of its FP, despite the relative insensitivity to high concentrations of BafA1. Therefore, the ability of a virus to infect cells in the presence of BafA1 does not necessarily imply virus entry to occur at the cell surface. Also a recombinant MHV carrying the spike protein of MHV-4 (MHV-JHM) was found to enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (MHV-S4; Figure S10 in Text S1) despite its ability to cause extensive cell-cell fusion [80]\u2013[82]. The ability of MHV to cause cell-cell fusion at neutral pH while requiring endocytic uptake for virus-cell fusion suggests different requirements and triggers for these two fusion processes. Similarly, RSV was recently shown to enter cells after endocytic uptake despite the ability of this virus to cause cell-cell fusion [13].",

Both siRNAs downregulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis-associated proteins, such as clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) and Dynamin 2 (DNM2), and agents affecting this uptake pathway (Chlopro, Dynasore, Dyngo-4a) were capable of inhibiting infection with MHV. Importantly, these findings could be confirmed in our novel replication-independent virus-cell fusion assay, thereby directly showing an involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in entry of MHV. Analysis of several accessory factors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis showed that clathrin-mediated entry of MHV strain A59 depends on clathrin-adaptor DAB2, but not on EPS15 or AAK1. Previously, clathrin-mediated entry of MHV strain 2 was also shown to be independent of EPS15 [83]. Based on the use of inhibitors, it was earlier concluded that MHV entry depends on cholesterol and lipid-rafts, which may be indicative of caveolae-mediated endocytosis [84], [85]. Although our replication-dependent assays indicate a requirement for caveolin 2 (CAV2) for infection, this protein was shown not to be involved in virus entry using our fusion assay. Also depletion of other proteins involved in caveolae-mediated endocytosis, including caveolin 1 (CAV1) and flotillins 1 and 2 (FLOT1 and FLOT2) did not affect MHV infection or fusion. Interestingly, fusion of MHV was severely inhibited by EIPA, an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1, which is regarded as a hallmark inhibitor of macropinocytosis. Apparently, inhibition of virus entry by EIPA does not prove by itself that a virus enters via this particular pathway. EIPA has been reported to affect several other cellular processes, including actin remodeling, internalization of lipid rafts, distribution of endosomes, and even clathrin-mediated endocytosis [86]\u2013[90]. Similar to the results obtained with the HeLa cells, also infection of murine LR7 cells was inhibited by compounds interfering with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Figure S11A in Text S1).",

Upon clathrin-mediated uptake these virions are temporarily associated with early endosomes as demonstrated by co-localization with RAB5 during live cell imaging. Furthermore, the importance of early endosomes for entry was indicated by siRNA-mediated downregulation of various proteins associated with early endosomes (EEA1, RAB5A, RAB5B, and RAB5C), which inhibited MHV infection, as well as virus-cell fusion. However, only very few MHV particles appeared to fuse in the early endosomes. Live cell imaging indicated fusion largely to occur in late endosomes and/or lysosomes. Consistently, depletion of host proteins associated with late endosome and late endosome-to-lysosome maturation (RAB7A, RAB7B, and the HOPS complex subunits VPS11, VPS33A, VPS39 and VPS41) or addition of U18666A, which blocks late endosome-to-lysosome trafficking, were shown to inhibit both infection and virus-cell fusion. The importance of lysosomes for entry was confirmed by using knockout cells lacking a functional HOPS complex (For a review on the HOPS complex see [54]). Interestingly, in these cells lysosomes are clustered in a perinuclear region of the cell rather than dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Complementation of the missing HOPS subunit restored the normal lysosome distribution and entry of MHV (Figure S7 in Text S1). The importance of late endosome-to-lysosome trafficking for efficient entry was also observed in murine cells (Figure S11C in Text S1) and for MHV-S4 carrying the S protein of MHV-4 (JHM; Figures S10 and S12 in Text S1).",

Nevertheless, MHV was much less sensitive to elevation of pH in the endo-/lysosomal system by the addition of BafA1 than viruses known to fuse in early or late endosomes (VSV and IAV). BafA1, an inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase was effective in blocking MHV entry only at high concentrations, which are known to prevent endosomal maturation in addition to the elevation of the pH [66]. The absence of a functional HOPS complex, which is required for late endosome-to-lysosome maturation, did not affect infection of cells with VSV or IAV, while entry of MHV was severely reduced. Thus, the low pH trigger that mediates entry of VSV and IAV in the endosomal system of these cells, is not sufficient to induce fusion of MHV. Other environmental cues, present in lysosomes only, are apparently required to activate conformational changes in the S protein leading to fusion. Indeed, inhibition of the three major classes of proteases present in the lysosome by CPI effectively prevented MHV fusion. Infection of murine LR7 cells with MHV was also inhibited by CPI (Figure S11B in Text S1). Strikingly, other inhibitors that affect members of a single protease family had none or only little impact on MHV fusion. These results are in consistence with a functional redundancy of protease family members [47], [76] and may explain why previous studies using specific lysosome protease inhibitors [27], [92] failed to detect entry inhibition. Also, the inhibition of MHV entry by MG132 may be explained by the known ability of the proteasome inhibitor to negatively affect lysosomal proteases [93]\u2013[95], although we cannot exclude that MG132 affects entry by its interference with lysosomal trafficking [96].",

Although we did not demonstrate cleavage of MHV S at the FP proximal position directly, a recent study found a cleaved form of the MHV S2 subunit to correspond with the fusion-active form [49]. Furthermore, introduction of an optimal FCS at the FP proximal position abolished the entry inhibition by the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor whilst introducing a dependency on furin-related enzymes. Consistent with the known presence of active furin in early endosomes (reviewed in [78]) the mutant virus no longer required trafficking to late endosomes/lysosomes for entry to occur. However, in the presence of furin inhibitor, entry of this mutant MHV was much more efficient in wild type cells than in cells lacking a functional HOPS complex (Fig. 8), indicating that under certain circumstances lysosomal proteases may play a role in entry of this virus as well. Trafficking of virions to lysosomes was shown to be also important for entry of FIPV, but not of MERS-CoV, in agreement with the latter virus containing a putative FCS immediately upstream of the FP. Correspondingly, entry of FIPV was inhibited by the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor CPI but not by furin inhibitor, while the reciprocal held true for MERS-CoV. The importance of S protein cleavage downstream of the S1/S2 boundary and upstream of the FP for infection has so far only been demonstrated for SARS-CoV and IBV [40], [43], [46]\u2013[48].",

            "text": "Based on the present study and on the work of others, we conclude that cleavage at the FP proximal position is likely to be a general requirement for CoV entry. With the exception of possibly IBV, cleavage at this position does not appear to occur in the virion-producing cell as it is not observed in released virions, but in the target cell (this study; [40], [43], [47], [48]). This suggests that receptor binding or other environmental cues are necessary to render the cleavage site accessible for proteolysis in the intact virion. Also for several other viruses, including RSV [13] and Ebola virus [16], cleavage of the fusion protein upon endocytosis has been shown to be required for entry. Our results furthermore show that cleavage at a FP-proximal position is an important determinant of the intracellular site of fusion. The question remains, however, why some CoVs evolved to fuse in early endosomal vesicles while others require trafficking to lysosomes. In view of the growing number of proteases that have been shown to cleave CoV spike proteins [97], this question should probably be studied in relation to the proteolytic enzymes available in the CoV target tissues and cells in vivo.",

For each virus spot the area underlying a circle of 0.213 \u00b5m2 was measured for its gray mean value. Viruses were considered colocalizing if the gray mean value reached 50% of the maximum. Subsequently red and blue color channels were merged, tracks imported and viruses classified using the viral track. If the virus co-localized with the endosomal vesicle over at least four sequential 30 s frames the virus was categorized as associating. Viruses that, after initial co-localization, separated from the vesicle were classified as \u2018associating/dissociating\u2019. If a virus particle faded and disappeared (and could not be found in other z-stacks) whilst co-localizing in previous intervals with an endosomal vesicle it was categorized as \u2018fusing\u2019 (Figure S2 and S3 in Text S1). When a viral particle co-localized with endosomal compartments but did neither dissociate nor fade during the 10 min acquisition period it was classified as \u2018non-fusing\u2019.

The FCS of MHV-S2\u2032FCS is cleaved by furin or furin-like enzymes to allow fusion of the virus in early endosomes. Trafficking of MHV from late endosomes to lysosomes (RAB7/LAMP1-positive compartments) is required for processing of MHV by lysosomal proteases and viral fusion to occur. We propose that the sequence immediately upstream of the FP is a key determinant of the intracellular site of fusion. MERS-CoV and FIPV enter cells via fusion in early endosomes or lysosomes, respectively. MERS-CoV, which contains a minimal FCS, is inhibited by furin inhibitor (FI) but not by the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor (CPI). The opposite holds true for FIPV. Based on this model, we predict that IBV strain Beaudette and HCoV-NL63, which contain FCSs (Fig. 10), to fuse in early endosomes in a furin-dependent manner. Other CoVs that do not contain a FCS at this position are predicted to fuse in lysosomes.",
