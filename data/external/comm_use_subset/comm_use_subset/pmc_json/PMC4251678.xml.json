            "text": "Five members of the interferon inducible transmembrane (IFITM) gene family are found in humans: IFITM1, 2, 3, 5 and 10. Typically, IFITMs 1, 2 and 3 are induced by both type I and type II interferon [1,2] although they are also constitutively expressed in cells of the upper airway and visceral pleura. IFITM 5 is not interferon-inducible and is involved in bone mineralization, and IFITM10 function is unknown. IFITM1, 2 and 3 are likely to have arisen from lineage and species-specific gene duplications. Indeed they are highly similar and highly conserved genes throughout evolution, with at least one member present in jawless fish (lampreys). The rapid expansion of the IFITM gene family during mammalian evolution was accompanied by positive selection, suggesting a broad role as antivirals. Conversely, IFITM5 and 10, which are not interferon-inducible, show no sign of gene duplications and positive selection [3,4].",

IFITM3 restricts IAV infection more potently than IFITM1 and 2, acting at the early stages of the viral replicative cycle, most likely fusion [7]. Furthermore, Caucasian and Han Chinese individuals bearing the synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12252 in the IFITM3 gene were significantly more likely to suffer from severe IAV infection and be hospitalized [8]. This SNP resulted in a truncated IFITM3 protein that is found mainly at the cell membrane instead of endosomal membranes [8]. IAV fusion and release into the cytoplasm occurs in the late endosomal compartment following acidification. Therefore it is likely that IFITM3 needs to be in the right intracellular compartment to exert its anti-IAV activity.",

IFITMs inhibit virus infection by preventing efficient virus-cell fusion and it is quite possible that several IFITMs with different intracellular location have arisen to protect against viruses using different entry pathways [6]. Interestingly, Hepatitis C virus, murine leukaemia virus and Lassa virus are not restricted by IFITMs proteins, which is quite puzzling given that these viruses have overlapping entry pathways with other viruses that are restricted [6].",

Remarkably, both studies report that up-regulation of IFITMs expression in target cells is insufficient to cause a significant block of HIV-1 infection. Instead, IFITMs expression at both producer and target cells was necessary for restriction. In any case, expression of IFITMs in producer cells results in more potent restriction than its expression in target cells, which was unexpected and unprecedented.",

In a complementary fashion, Tartour et al. show that primary macrophages behaved in a similar way and produced HIV-1 particles with lower infectivity upon upregulation of IFITMs. In agreement with previous reports, Compton et al. show that HIV-1 is not really affected by IFITMs in HeLa CD4 cells and Tartour et al. show that murine leukaemia virus is insensitive to IFITMs.",
