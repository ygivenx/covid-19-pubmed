The World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported an estimated 12.6 million deaths each year due to unhealthy environments, particularly climate change and pollution [3]. The report also identifies diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections and malaria in the top ten causes of environment related deaths [3]. Climate change influences the emergence and re-emergence of many infectious diseases [1, 2, 4, 5]. Dengue fever, tick-borne diseases, diarrheal disease, enteric fever, viral encephalitis, respiratory tract infections, and meningitis are much increased in recent times [1\u20134, 6]. In addition, emerging and reemerging diseases such as chikungunya and Zika, have also been linked to climate change influences, and have been proposed as partially responsible for autochnous transmission in places not traditionally endemic for such diseases [7, 8].",

They predicted that global surface temperature will increase by 1.5\u00b0C compared to the year 1850 by the end of the 21st century (2081\u20132100) [1]. Climate change is predicted to directly influence zoonotic infectious disease transmission by changing the geographic range of a vector [9]. Altered climatic conditions may increase vector biting rate and the reproduction rate of the vector and shorten the pathogen incubation period [9\u201312]. Climate-related increases in sea surface temperature and sea levels can lead to higher incidence of waterborne infectious diseases [9, 13, 14].",

Bangladesh is the biggest delta and contains the second largest river basin in the world [15]. The majority of the land is low and flat, and only 10% lies over one meter above the mean sea surface [15]. Because of monsoon weather and the presence of the Bay of Bengal in the south, extreme weather events like flood and cyclone are common [15, 16]. This unique geographic and topographic location makes it reportedly the most vulnerable country to climate change effects [16]. Lack of resilience and adaptive capacity, dense population and poverty make the situation worse [16]. Unfortunately, very few studies on the relationship between various environmental variables and trends of infectious disease incidence have been performed so far in Bangladesh, although there are reports of some infections increasing sporadically in different regions of the country [17\u201319]. Climate change and health related studies are so far mainly reported from developed countries, but studies from vulnerable countries are still meagre [20, 21]. Furthermore, published studies typically only focus on a single disease.",

The male to female ratio in this study was 1.3: 1. Although there are no published data, it is generally believed that more males come into hospital in Bangladesh because traditionally females wait at home with their disease until complications develop [22, 23].

The increase in pneumonia cases seen in males may be because men have more occupational exposure to conditions that increase the chance of receiving a diagnosis of pneumonia such as dust, fumes, smoking etc. All six diseases showed a significant (P = 0.01) rise in incidence between the study years 2008 and 2012. The number of cases more than doubled for all diseases except enteric fever, which also showed significant increases. In contrast, during this same period the total number of admissions to the medical ward and to in the hospital showed no significant rise. We propose that the rise in frequency of the studied diseases could be explained by the influence of weather changes. It is important to note that during this period no epidemics of the studied diseases happened in the Sylhet region. The total impression is consistent with previous reports. In a review of the literature, the incidence of pyogenic meningitis, encephalitis and dengue was predicted to be greatly influenced and increased by global warming in the coming years [24]. W.H.O reported dengue, viral encephalitis, diarrheal disease, enteric fever, pneumonia and meningitis as most sensitive to climate factors, and predicted a huge rise of cases in tropical countries [25]. Climate Change Cell, Bangladesh reported that, from 1984 to 1993 there were 301,651cases of malaria in Bangladesh, but from 1994 to 2003 it increased to 507,485 (68% increased incidence) [26]. Although after the introduction of artemisinin treatment and government and other partner organization lead massive drive for malaria elimination, the cases decreased to 1.4/1000 population in Bangladesh [27]. The same report revealed an increasing trend for diarrheal diseases, Kala-azar and skin diseases in three districts (drought-prone Rajshahi, flood-prone Manikganj and salinity-dense Satkhira) of Bangladesh between 1999 to 2005 [26]. The report also described a positive correlation between rainfall and diarrheal and skin disease in Rajshahi and Satkhira, and a negative correlation of diarrheal disease with temperature [26]. Another focus group discussion (FGD) based study reported an increased number of diarrheal diseases, typhoid and skin problems after the cyclone Sidr and Aila in southern part (Barguna and Khulna) of the country [28].",

This agrees with earlier studies in both Dhaka, Bangladesh (26) where the highest number (45%) of enteric fever occurred during monsoon period [38],and a Cambodian study [39] but no relationship between incidence of enteric fever and season was seen in Kenya [40]. In our study, most meningitis (293; 55%) and encephalitis (355; 59%) occurred during autumn and winter. This finding is partly consistent with other studies done in Africa. Meningitis epidemics in West Africa occurred during the coolest season [41]. A recent time series analysis over 66 countries found that bacterial meningitis season peaks during the winter months, [42], similar to our findings. A major causative organism of meningitis (Neisseria meningitides) was found to be high and active during dry periods in the presence of dust and were then washed away with rainfall, so as the case frequency fell down [43, 44]. However, in our study, we found an almost equal number of meningitis cases in rainy season compared to other seasons. Regional findings of seasonality in terms of encephalitis are also supportive of our findings. Highest number of encephalitis cases in rainy period (August-September) were seen in Nepal [45]. In India, the incidence of Japanese encephalitis was also highest during August to November (rainy and early winter) with a peak in October [46]. Another study from China also reported similar findings [47].",

The annual average rainfall is increasing by 10.6 mm per decade outside the usual rainy period, while rainfall during the season is decreasing by 7.6 mm per decade [49, 50]. In our study, we found a positive correlation between the incidences of malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea with increasing temperature. These results are similar to other national and international findings. A previous study in Chittagong, Bangladesh showed increased malaria cases with increasing temperature [30]. Studies have shown a positive relationship between increased malaria and increasing temperature [51, 52]. Studies in South Asia and South America (Venezuela and Columbia) have documented the association between malaria outbreaks and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle [53]. A significant increase in malaria cases with increasing temperature was seen in Rwanda and Uganda [54, 55], but this was not seen in studies done in the African highland region [56, 57]. Increased temperature allows faster replication of mosquito populations [47, 58]. Higher temperatures also change human behavior, for example more outdoor activities may be undertaken which further increases the risk of exposure [47]. Diarrheal cases including dysentery have been found to be higher in high temperature in Bangladesh, Taiwan and China [59\u201361]. A study in Dhaka, Bangladesh showed an increase number of enteric fever cases with an increase temperature which supports our findings [38], as does a similar study from Southern Australia[62]. Furthermore, a strong linear association has been noted between temperature and notification of salmonellosis globally [53]. Temperature affects the transmission of food-borne disease in various ways. The temperature directly affects the rate of replication of bacterial and protozoan pathogens and the survival of enteroviruses in the environment [61, 63]. In addition, these variations may also have a significant impact on the environmental reservoirs of infection as well as human behavior [63]. Moreover, both salmonella and cholera bacteria, for example, proliferate more rapidly at higher temperatures; salmonella in animal gut and food, cholera in water [13, 53]. Our study shows an inverse relationship between encephalitis, meningitis and pneumonia with temperature. The pneumonia findings are consistent with a study done in China, but not with another study conducted in Spain [36, 64]. For encephalitis and meningitis our findings differ to other studies done in India, China and Niger where they found increased evidence of cases and vector during hot environment [47, 65, 66].Viral encephalitis cases in Sweden have reportedly increased in response to a succession of warmer winters over the past two decades [53]. This inverse relationship with temperature in our study merits further exploration.",

Eighteen heatwaves were reported in India between 1980 and1998 [67]. Our study found a higher trend of malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea cases with higher humidity. The findings are further supported by studies done in Chittagong, Bangladesh and China with similar trend [30, 61]. Relative humidity influences biological and feeding behavior of mosquitoes [47]. At higher humidity, mosquitoes generally survive for longer and disperse further [47, 58]. Higher humidity also affects the rate of replication of bacterial and protozoan pathogens and their survival in the environment [63]. We did not find any influence of humidity on enteric fever and pneumonia, in line with other studies [34, 36]. The incidence of pneumonia, encephalitis and meningitis is inversely related to humidity in this study. In India an inverse association was seen between the number of Culex mosquitoes (the vector for Japanese encephalitis) and humidity [66], although in China, higher cases of encephalitis was seen with higher humidity [47]. These mixed findings may reflect differences in etiology of encephalitis and bacterial meningitis, as well as differences in case definitions between study sites. These could also explained by diagnostic limitations, and in some cases the meningoencephalitis syndrome may be caused by bacteria favoring dry and dusty weather.",

            "text": "Heavy rainfall can have a diverse range of effects on disease. For example, in tropical and subtropical regions with crowding and poverty, heavy rainfall and flooding may trigger behavioral changes such as increased contact between people and distribution of pathogens in floodwater, leading to outbreaks of diarrhea [58]. We found that the incidence of diarrhea, malaria, enteric fever and pneumonia increased with rainfall. For diarrhea, our findings are consistent with other national and international studies [59\u201361]. A positive relationship between increased rainfall and the incidence of enteric fever was also found in Dhaka, Bangladesh and southern Australia [38, 62]. One possible explanation is, heavy rainfall may affect the frequency and level of contamination of drinking water and hence the spread waterborne infections [13, 68]. Area with existing high burdens of infectious disease and poor sanitary infrastructure often experience increased rates of diarrheal diseases after heavy rainfall [58]. Our findings in terms of malaria are also similar to other national and regional studies [30, 31]. Rainfall plays an important role in the transmission of malaria, as mosquitoes need water to support the larval and pupal stages of development [31, 58]. A study also found higher deaths from acute lower respiratory tract illness during rainy season in a pediatric population [34]. In 2011\u201312, the highest incidences of encephalitis and meningitis occurred while there was very low rainfall. Our findings are supported by other reports in the case of meningitis [44, 65]. Nevertheless, researchers found the opposite for Japanese encephalitis, where the vector replicates and transmits more disease with high rainfall [45, 66].",

We tried to overcome this limitation by setting case definitions for enrollment in the study and included only the cases who survived for more than 24 hours, where there was more clinical information to make an informed diagnosis. The death rate in the first 24 hours due to these infections (Bacterial meningitis-0.92%; encephalitis 2.32% and all-cause mortality 3.62%) during that period was low and unlikely to influence our results [69].
