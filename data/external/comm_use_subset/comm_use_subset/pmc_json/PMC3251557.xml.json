Similar to most other countries, the peak influenza season in China is associated with higher health care utilization [2]. In China, weekly cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) in acute-care settings throughout the country are reported to the Chinese National Influenza Center(CNIC) and are mainly attributed to influenza virus, predominantly influenza A virus (FLU-A) and influenza B virus (FLU-B) [3], [4]. In addition to the influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses can also cause ILI symptoms in adults, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), including parainfluenza virus type 4 [5], rhinovirus, adenovirus, human coronaviruses and human metapneumovirus [6]. Thus, multiple respiratory viruses may circulate among adults and cause influenza symptoms [5]. There is inconsistency about whether certain symptoms can be used to distinguish specific infections, and it is generally accepted that there are no symptoms specific to any viral infection. Some studies have attempted to identify signs or symptoms specifically associated with influenza virus or other viruses [7], [8], but no definitive conclusions have been drawn.",

Our research suggests that FLU-A was the predominant viral pathogen among ILI patients in Beijing from August 2010 to May 2011, which was similar to that of 2009, 2008 and 2006, but different to 2007 [3], [4], [17], [18]. Almost all positive samples demonstrated FLU-A strains, while few FLU-B strains were detected. This result differs from that reported from the United States, which demonstrated that 26% of the positive specimens were influenza B viruses [19]. This discrepancy may in part reflect the epidemic of influenza A virus in North China in 2010\u20132011. It is possible that FLU-B may not have caused ILI symptoms severe enough for the sufferer to seek medical attention. It is also possible that FLU-B was not circulating in this geographical area during this time. According to the CNIC, Influenza B virus-positive rate was about 1.6% in North China from June 2010 to May 2011 [4]. The percentage of tests that were positive for influenza which included FLU-A and FLU-B was 23.7% which was lower than the same period in 2009 [4], [17].",

That the peaks in ILI and the increase in acute respiratory infections (ARI) are due to influenza is supported by the seasonal pattern of high-probability ILI, the low level of respiratory syncytial virus infections, and laboratory results in the influenza season [23], [28], [29]. During the 2010\u201311 influenza season, a seasonal pattern in ILI activity was observed and influenza activity peaked in late January 2011 in Beijing. Compared with the previous pandemic year (2009), lower outpatient numbers were observed during 2010\u201311(Figure 2).

This is consistent with the results of Boivin, of Ohmit and of Monto, who reported that cough and a fever>38\u00b0C were associated with a positive PCR test in the influenza population, when influenza was prevalent within the community [7], [31], [32]. Our specimens were collected during the influenza season in Beijing and the cough appears to be specific for influenza in this cohort. This is also consistent with the view of Call et al, who believe that both fever and cough are more specific for influenza among elderly individuals when influenza virus is circulating in an area [30]. We did not find any statistically significant difference in the occurrence of fever (temperature >39\u00b0C) between the FLU-A-positive group and the FLU-A-negative group (\u03c72, p>0.05). A study that involved all age groups demonstrated that muscle and joint pain and headache were associated with influenza [20].
