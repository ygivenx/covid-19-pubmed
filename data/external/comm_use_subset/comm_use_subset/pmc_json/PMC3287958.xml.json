It is a multifactorial disease where, besides the causative pathogenic agent, calf age, management and environmental factors, may influence the clinical outcome [1].",

Commonly reported causative pathogens are rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) [2-5]. Enteric colibacillosis is manifested primarily by varying degrees of diarrhoea and dehydration and the outcome may be fatal. The major virulence factors of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli in NCD are the F5 (K99) adhesion antigen and also the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) [6]. Under Swedish conditions, E. coli is of practitioner's concern from a therapeutic perspective. In most cases of NCD in Swedish dairy calves antimicrobial therapy is not indicated since most enteric E. coli strains from calves are non pathogenic [7]. However, for treatment of enteritis caused by enteropathogenic E. coli, or of E. coli bacteraemia secondary to enteritis, antimicrobials given orally or systemically are recommended [8]. Knowledge of the susceptibility is necessary for elaboration of guidelines on prudent use of antimicrobials.",

[24] the epidemiology of resistant E. coli in calves is multifactorial, complex and e.g. influenced by co-selection due to linkage of resistance genes. But widespread resistance is fundamentally a consequence of historical and current use of antimicrobials and associations between use of antimicrobials and resistance in enteric E. coli of calves have been documented [19,20,22,25-28]. However, in the present study resistance is not a direct sequel to antimicrobial use since no calf was treated prior to sampling. Antimicrobial use in calves is still not uncommon in Sweden and Ortman & Svensson [29] showed that in dairy herds about one third of diarrhoeic calves (1-90 days) were treated with trimethoprim/sulfa, enrofloxacin or other antimicrobials. Also in the present study NCD was treated with antimicrobials in several herds but there was no statistical association between such routines and resistance. Although the total use of antimicrobials in the herds is unknown, the absence of association indicates that the high prevalence of resistance is not solely an effect of a direct selection pressure by use of antimicrobials to the calves.",

[28] hypothesized that, regardless of use of antimicrobials, tetracycline resistance in E. coli is co-selected in calves by an unknown \"beneficial mutation\". Likewise, Khachatryan et al.

            "text": "In the present study, resistance was more common in E. coli from calves with diarrhea than in isolates from healthy calves. Also multivariate analysis showed that resistance to tetracycline in E. coli was associated with diarrhea in calves. A higher occurrence of resistance in E. coli in calves from herds experiencing problems with NCD was shown also by Gunn et al. [34]. A plausible reason for this is that antimicrobials are used more often in herds with a high disease incidence, as indicated in the present study by the more common routine of treating NCD with antimicrobials in CD+ herds than in CD- herds. However, a higher prevalence of resistant E. coli in calves with diarrhoea could also be due to linkage between virulence genes and resistance genes as proposed by Martinez & Baquero [35]. Such linkage was demonstrated in E. coli from pigs with diarrhoea [36,37] and could imply co-selection of virulence genes by use of antimicrobials and conversely maintenance of resistance in populations of pathogenic bacteria as proposed by Boerlin et al. [36]. In the present study phenotypic resistance to one or more antimicrobials was associated with presence of the virulence genes espP, irp or fyuA in E. coli. However, there was no association to single antimicrobials or resistance phenotypes. Moreover, none of these virulence factors were associated with diarrhea and the findings should be interpreted with caution. Likewise, Suojala et al. [38] found an association between the virulence factor iucD and resistance to streptomycin, ampicillin, sulphametoxazole and trimethoprim in E. coli from dairy cows with mastitis, but they found no association between the virulence factor and patogenicity.",

This suggestion is supported by international studies showing a higher prevalence of E. coli F5 than in the Swedish studies [39-42]. This virulence gene was not found in any isolate in this study and 21 out of 40 of the investigated genes were not detected or rarely detected. Although the number of isolates tested was small, this contradicts a common occurrence of enteropathogenic E. coli in NCD. A possible exception is E. coli with the virulence gene terZ which was associated with diarrhea. However, further studies are needed to clarify clinical relevance of these virulence genes in NCD.",

Other sampling errors were a mismatch in age at sampling between CD+ and CD- calves, and an extended age interval for CD+ and CD- calves (1-135 days, mean 21.9) compared to the criteria (four weeks). Nevertheless, there were clear differences in clinical signs between CD- and CD+ calves and CD- and CD+ herds regarding mortality, occurrence of diarrhea, general appearance and respiratory signs. One contributing reason for this could be that CD+ herds were larger than CD- herds. Larger herds were more likely to have calf group feeder in the present study, and there might be a larger number of neonatal calves in the herd during the same time period which increases the risk for infectious enteric diseases. The association between diarrhea in calves and large herd size agrees with the findings in a recent Swedish study on calf morbidity and mortality in herds with different size (C Sandgren personal communication). The calf mortality in this study was higher than previously reported in Swedish herds [45] which also could reflect a negative impact of large herd size on calf health. Calf rearing practices have changed concurrently with herd size.",
