The presence of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies suggests that Israeli camels were exposed to MERS-CoV in the past. The VNT assay was more sensitive than the ELISA, which had only 91.7% sensitivity when compared to VNT assay. That feature could be related to the fact that the ELISA coating antigen was the MERS-CoV spike S1 protein, whereas the VNT assay employed complete virions that could reveal antibodies against other viral proteins. Alternatively, whereas the ELISA detects only IgG, the VNT detects any isotype of antibodies which could be IgG, IgM or IgA. The VNT assay was also more specific than the ELISA, which had a calculated specificity of only 93.33% when compared to VNT. In addition, the higher strength of the VNT assay as compared to ELISA might be attributed by the fact that borderline sera by ELISA were not considered.",

Moreover, the proportion of sera with low VNT titers (<320) in Israel was about 70.4%, whereas in in the surrounding countries only about 10% of the sera had low VNT titers meaning that the MERS-CoV seroprevalence in Israel is lower than that in the surrounding countries.
