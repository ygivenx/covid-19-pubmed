RNA viruses seem particularly prone to host shift [1\u20134], with HIV, Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus all having been acquired by humans from other host species [5\u20137]. Whilst some pathogens may be pre-adapted to a novel host, there are increasing numbers of examples demonstrating that adaptation to the new host occurs following a host shift [8, 9]. These adaptations may allow a pathogen to enter host cells, increase replication rates, avoid or suppress the host immune response, or optimise virulence or transmission [10, 11]. For example, in the 2013\u20132016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, a mutation in the viral glycoprotein gene that arose early in the outbreak and rose to high frequency was found to increase infectivity in human cells and decrease infectivity in bats, which are thought to be the source of Ebola virus [12, 13]. Likewise, a switch of a parvovirus from cats to dogs resulted in mutations in the virus capsid that allowed the virus to bind to cell receptors in dogs, but resulted in the virus losing its ability to infect cats [14, 15].",

            "text": "In some instances adaptation to a novel host relies on specific mutations that arise repeatedly whenever a pathogen switches to a given host. For example, in the jump of HIV-1 from chimps to humans, codon 30 of the gag gene has undergone a change that increases virus replication in humans, and this has occurred independently in all three HIV-1 lineages [5, 16]. Similarly, five parallel mutations have been observed in the two independent epidemics of SARS coronavirus following its jump from palm civets into humans [17]. Similar patterns have been seen in experimental evolution studies, where parallel genetic changes occur repeatedly when replicate viral lineages adapt to a new host species in the lab. For example, when Vesicular Stomatitis Virus was passaged in human or dog cells, the virus evolved parallel mutations when evolved on the same cell type [18]. Likewise, a study passaging Tobacco Etch Potyvirus on four plant species found parallel mutations occurred only when the virus infected the same host species [19]. These parallel mutations provide compelling evidence that these genetic changes are adaptive, with the same mutations evolving independently in response to natural selection [20]. These studies have only used a limited number of hosts, and so do not provide information on how viral evolution occurs across a wide phylogenetic breadth of host species.",

Here, we asked whether viruses acquire the same genetic changes when evolving in the same and closely related host species. We experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus called Drosophila C Virus (DCV; Discistroviridae) in 19 species of Drosophilidae that vary in their relatedness and shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million years ago [35, 36]. We then sequenced the genomes of the evolved viral lineages and tested whether the same genetic changes arose when the virus was evolved in closely related host species.",

We deep sequenced the evolved virus genomes to generate over 740,000 300bp sequence reads from each viral lineage. Out of 8989 sites, 584 contained a SNP with a derived allele frequency >0.05 in at least one viral lineage, and 84 of these were tri-allelic. None of these variants were found at an appreciable frequency in five sequencing libraries produced from the ancestral virus, indicating that they had spread though populations during the experiment (Fig 1). In multiple cases these variants had nearly reached fixation (Fig 1).",

We estimated the genetic differentiation between viral lineages by calculating FST. We found that viral lineages that had evolved within the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species (Fig 2; P<0.001). Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in substitution biases in the different host species (Fisher Exact Test: p = 0.14; see methods), suggesting that this pattern is not driven by changes in the types of mutations in different host species.",

When DCV was passaged through different species of Drosophilidae, we found the same genetic changes arose repeatedly in replicate viral lineages in the same host species. Such repeatable parallel genetic changes to the same host environment are compelling evidence that these changes are adaptive [20]. We then examined whether these same genetic changes might occur in closely related host species, as these are likely to present a similar environment for the virus. We found that viruses evolved in closely related hosts were more similar to each other than viruses that evolved in more distantly related species. Therefore, mutations that evolve in one host species frequently arise when the virus infects closely related hosts. This finding of parallel genetic changes in closely related host species suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species.",

For example, in a large cross-infection experiment involving Drosophila sigma viruses (Rhabdoviridae) isolated from different species of Drosophila, the viruses tended to replicate most efficiently in species closely related to their natural hosts [34]. This suggests that these viruses had acquired adaptations to their host species that benefitted them when they infected closely related species.

To minimise the amount of genetic variation in the DCV isolate we used to initiate the experimental evolution study, we aimed to isolate single infectious clones of DCV using a serial dilution procedure. DCV was produced in Schneider\u2019s Drosophila line 2 (DL2) cells [52] as described in [53]. Cells were cultured at 25\u00b0C in Schneider\u2019s Drosophila Medium with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (all Invitrogen, UK). The DCV strain used was isolated from D. melanogaster collected in Charolles, France [54]. DL2 cells were seeded into two 96-well tissue culture plates at approximately 104 cells in 100 \u03bcl of media per well. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plates by incubating at 25\u00b0C for five hours or over-night. Serial 1:1 dilutions of DCV were made in complete Schneider\u2019s media, giving a range of final dilutions from 1:108\u20131:4x1014. 100 \u03bcl of these dilutions were then added to the cells and incubated for 7 days, 8 replicates were made for each DCV dilution. Each well was then examined for DCV infection of the DL2 cells, and a well was scored as positive for DCV infection if clear cytopathic effects were present in the majority of the cells. The media was taken from the wells with the greatest dilution factor that were scored as infected with DCV and stored at -80\u00b0C. This processes was then repeated using the DCV samples from the first dilution series. One clone, B6A, was selected for amplification and grown in cell culture as described above. Media containing DCV was removed and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet any remaining cell debris, before being aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. The Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50 (TCID50) of the DCV was 6.32 x 109 infectious particles per ml using the Reed-Muench end-point method [55].",

For the first passage this was the cloned DCV isolate in cell culture supernatant (described above), and then subsequently was the virus extracted from the previous passage (described below). The needle was pricked into the pleural suture on the thorax of flies, towards the midcoxa. Each replicate was infected using a new needle and strict general cleaning procedures were used to minimise any risk of cross-contamination between replicates. Species were collected and inoculated in a randomised order each passage. Flies were then placed into vials of cornmeal medium and kept at 22\u00b0C and 70% relative humidity. Flies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen 3 days post-infection, homogenised in Ringer\u2019s solution (2.5\u03bcl per fly) and then centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 mins at 4\u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was removed and frozen at -80\u00b0C to be used for infecting flies in the subsequent passage. The remaining homogenate was preserved in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at -80\u00b0C for RNA extraction. The 3 day viral incubation period was chosen based on time course and pilot data showing that viral load reaches a maximum at approximately 3 days post-infection. This process was repeated for 10 passages for all species, except D. montana where only 8 passages were carried out due to the fly stocks failing to reproduce. Each lineage was injected into a mean of 11 flies at each passage (range 4\u201318). Experimental evolution studies in different tissue types have seen clear signals of adaptation in 100 virus generations [18]. Based on log2 change in RNA viral load we estimate that we have passaged DCV for approximately 100\u2013200 generations.",
