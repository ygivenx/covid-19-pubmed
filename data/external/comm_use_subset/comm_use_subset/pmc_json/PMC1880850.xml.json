On the basis of haemagglutinin (HA) sequences, these circulating HPAI H5N1 viruses fall into different lineages, termed clades; viruses isolated in Viet Nam and Indonesia in 2004 and 2005, respectively, were designated as reference strains for Clades I and II [1]. The HA sequences of Clade I and Clade II viruses differ by 4% to 5% at the amino acid level and the viruses of the two clades are antigenically distinguishable. The H5N1 viruses are not efficiently transmitted from person to person. Potentially, a virus capable of efficient human-to-human transmission could result from either adaptation of the HPAI H5N1 viruses and/or reassortment of the H5N1 virus genome with that of a circulating human influenza virus. Widespread dissemination of such a virus could cause significant morbidity and mortality, since humans are generally immunologically na\u00efve to H5 influenza subtypes.",

The basis for the apparent virulence of HPAI H5N1 strains in humans is relatively poorly understood. In Vietnamese patients, the disease was characterized by severe pneumonia, lymphopenia, high viral loads in the respiratory tract, and hypercytokinemia [3]. Beyond supportive care, treatment options for human patients with H5N1 avian influenza remain limited and are empiric; some H5N1 viruses are resistant to older antiviral agents such as amantadine and rimantadine [4,5], and the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamavir and zanamavir has not yet been confirmed in prospective studies. In addition, H5N1 viruses resistant to oseltamavir have been reported [6,7]. Patients who recover from infection possess antibodies that neutralize their infecting virus in vitro, suggesting that antibody-mediated immunity may contribute to resolution of infection [3].",

Clinically, antibody therapy using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is effectively used as prophylaxis against varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, and respiratory syncytial virus infections [8]. In the context of influenza, specific mAbs can confer prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mice [9\u201311]. Passive immunization by vertical acquisition of specific antibodies is also associated with influenza immunity in animal models and in early infancy in humans [12\u201315]. Of more immediate relevance, transfusion of human blood products from patients recovering from the 1918 \u201cSpanish \u2018flu\u201d was associated with a 50% reduction in influenza mortality during the pandemic [16]. Humanized mouse mAbs and equine F(ab\u2032)2 fragments specific for H5N1 have also been used for efficacious prophylaxis and therapy in the mouse model [17,18]. Collectively, these observations suggest that passive antibody therapy against HPAI H5N1 viruses could be a potentially viable, adjunctive treatment option in human cases of H5N1 influenza.",

This approach is rapid and yields stable B cell clones that secrete fully human antibodies that have been selected in the course of an immune response to the pathogen [19]. The aim of this study was to generate human mAbs with neutralizing activity against H5N1 viruses. mAbs were derived from immortalized memory B cells collected from donors who had recovered from H5N1 infection. Four mAbs, with neutralizing activity in vitro, had prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in mice challenged with HPAI H5N1. These mAbs, and others like them, could have a role in adjunctive treatment of human cases of H5N1 influenza.",

Briefly, neat supernatants were incubated with 100 TCID50 of virus for 1 h at room temperature prior to addition to monolayers of MDCK cells. Cell monolayers were incubated for a further 3\u20134 d and examined for cytopathic effect. Determination of endpoint neutralizing antibody titers was performed in a similar fashion, except that plasma or supernatant samples were serially two-fold diluted prior to mixing with 100 TCID50 of virus. Plasma samples were tested at a starting dilution of 1:10, while supernatants were tested at a starting dilution of 1:8 and residual infectivity was tested in four wells per dilution. The neutralizing titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum at which the infectivity of 100 TCID50 of the appropriate wild-type (wt) H5N1 virus for MDCK cells was completely neutralized in 50% of the wells. Infectivity was identified by the presence of cytopathic effect on d 4 and the titer was calculated by the Reed-Muench method.",

To measure prophylactic efficacy, mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 1 ml of various antibody preparations or hyperimmune sheep antisera raised against baculovirus expressed HA of A/VN/1203/2004 (H5N1) that was kindly provided by Dr. G.

Control human antibodies were IgG1 mAbs D2.2 or A146, specific for diphtheria toxin and anthrax protective antigen, respectively, and were prepared in the same fashion as the influenza-reactive antibodies. Twenty-four hours after i.p. administration, the mice were bled to collect samples for measurement of neutralizing human mAb titers, then challenged intranasally (i.n.) with 105 TCID50 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) or A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) in 50 \u03bcl.

IgG+ memory B cells recovered from frozen PBMC were immortalized with EBV. Cultures secreting neutralizing antibodies were identified by a microneutralization assay against the prototype Clade I virus, A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), and cloned by limiting dilution. Supernatants from approximately 11,000 wells were screened to identify 15 independent clones secreting a neutralizing antibody. Of these clones, three were isolated from donor CL26, one from donor CL114, and eleven from donor CL115. The number of clones isolated from each donor did not correlate with the plasma titer of neutralizing antibody, though this was not surprising given the small sample size. Clones producing antibodies that recognized H5 HA by ELISA, but did not neutralize live virus, were also identified from each donor (unpublished data). Clones FLA3.14 and FLA5.10, isolated from donor CL26, were the first obtained and were studied more extensively. Subsequently, clones FLD20.19 and FLD21.140, isolated from donor CL115, became available and were studied in parallel with FLA3.14 and FLA5.10. Clones FLA3.14, FLA5.10, FLD20.19, and FLD21.140 secreted IgG1,\u03ba antibodies with neutralizing activity against the autologous virus A/Vietnam/CL26/2004 and other more recent Clade I viruses circulating in Viet Nam during 2005 and 2006 (Table 1). Significantly, more distant HPAI H5N1 strains, including the Clade II H5N1 virus A/Indonesia/5/2005, were neutralized by FLA3.14 and FLD20.19 (Table 2). In contrast, none of these clones neutralized an H3N2 influenza virus, A/California/7/2004 (Table 2). IgG1,\u03ba mAbs of irrelevant specificity (diphtheria toxin and anthrax protective antigen) were used as negative controls and did not neutralize any influenza virus (Tables 1 and 2).

Following i.n. administration, these H5N1 viruses replicate to high titer in the lungs of the mice and some isolates disseminate to extrapulmonary sites and are lethal for mice [22,23]. To explore the efficacy of mAbs FLA3.14 and FLA5.10 for pre-exposure prophylaxis, BALB/c mice were passively immunized by i.p. administration of graded doses of mAbs and then challenged i.n. with A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) 24 h later. All preparations of mAb FLA5.10 conferred 100% protection from lethality by A/Vietnam/1203/04 (p = 0.001) (Figure 1). mAb FLA3.14 also conferred some protection from lethal A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) infection, but with lower efficacy and in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1). Mice receiving the highest dose of FLA3.14 were afforded almost complete protection (p = 0.001), whilst mice receiving the lowest dose of FLA3.14 were as susceptible as mice that received a human mAb of irrelevant specificity, though time to death was delayed (p = 0.02). Mice that received hyperimmune anti-H5 polyclonal sheep antiserum were afforded complete protection. These data, demonstrating the relatively greater in vivo activity of FLA5.10 over FLA3.14 against A/Vietnam/1203/04, are consistent with the in vitro neutralization titers presented in Table 1.",

Mice that were passively immunized with FLA3.14, FLA5.10, or a human mAb of irrelevant specificity (D2.2) were challenged with A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) 24 h later, and the level of virus replication in different organs was determined 2 and 4 d later. Mice that received the control mAb, D2.2, had high titers of virus in the lungs (Figure 2A), with evidence of extrapulmonary dissemination indicated by viral replication in the brain (Figure 2B) and spleen (Figure 2C). In contrast, mice passively immunized with FLA3.14 or FLA5.10 had significantly (10- to 100-fold) lower titers of virus in the lungs (Figure 2A) (p = 0.01, FLA3.14 versus D2.2; p = 0.001, FLA5.10 versus D2.2), undetectable viral burdens in the brain (Figure 2B) and a low titer of virus detected in the spleens of mice that received FLA5.10 (Figure 2C). Alongside the reduction in lung viral titers, mice that received prophylaxis with FLA5.10 had less dramatic pathological changes in the pulmonary airways and parenchymal tissue (Figure 3). Thus, the percentage of abnormal bronchioles with necrosis and viral antigen in lung sections from mice (n = 2 per group) that received FLA5.10 prophylaxis was less (13%) than in control mice (80%). Similarly, there were fewer inflammatory interstitial lesions in which H5 antigen was detected by immunohistochemical staining in the lung sections of mice given FLA5.10 relative to the control antibody, D2.2 (1 versus >10) (Figure 3). To a slightly lesser extent, FLA3.14 prophylaxis also limited bronchiolitis (31% versus 80%) and H5-associated interstitial pathology (2 versus >10) when compared with control mice (n = 2). These data suggest that prophylaxis with FLA3.14 or FLA5.10 probably confers protection from lethal challenge through a combination of limiting viral replication in the lung, attenuating virus-induced lung pathology, and blocking extrapulmonary dissemination of virus to distant organs.",

FLA3.14, FLA5.10, FLD20.19, and FLD21.140 provided robust protection from lethality in A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) infected mice at all time points, whilst an irrelevant control mAb, D2.2, gave no protection (p = 0.003) (Figure 4). These promising therapeutic results against a Clade I virus from Viet Nam led us to examine the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs FLA3.14, FLA5.10, FLD20.19, and FLD21.140 against A/Indonesia/5/2005, an antigenically divergent H5N1 virus from Clade II. The efficacy of treatment with FLA3.14, FLA5.10, FLD20.19, and FLD21.140 was determined in BALB/c mice infected i.n. 24 h previously with 5 LD50 of A/Indonesia/5/2005. Consistent with the in vitro neutralization data (Table 2), mice treated with FLA3.14 and FLD20.19, but not FLA5.10 or the control mAb D2,2, were significantly protected from A/Indonesia/5/2005 lethal infection (p = 0.003) (Figure 5). Although FLD21.140 did not demonstrate neutralizing activity in vitro against A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Table 2), treatment with this mAb significantly protected the mice (p = 0.003) from A/Indonesia/5/2005 lethal infection. This observation of neutralization in vivo suggests that a factor found in vivo enhances the neutralizing activity of this mAb, accounting for its efficacy in vivo in preventing mortality associated with infection. These data provide proof of concept that mAb therapy for at least 72 h postinfection in the mouse model can markedly improve survival from highly virulent H5N1 infection. Importantly, these data also imply it is possible to obtain significant cross-protection against a Clade II H5N1 virus using a mAb elicited by a Clade I virus.",

Passive immunity was associated with significantly reduced viral burdens in the lung and negligible dissemination of virus to the brain or spleen. Viral dissemination might be an important aspect in the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses in both mice and humans. In Vietnamese patients with H5N1 infection, fatal outcomes were strongly associated with the presence of viral genetic material, or viable virus, at extrapulmonary sites [3]. Conversely, there was no evidence of extrapulmonary virus dissemination in patients who survived [3]. In addition to evidence of viral dissemination, patients with fatal H5N1 infections had high viral loads in the respiratory tract, hypercytokinemia, multiple organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [3]. Our proposed model of H5N1 pathogenesis [3] argues that early diagnosis and antiviral interventions that limit the ensuing inflammatory cascade should be central to treatment.",

Multiple reports of physicians using human blood products from recovering influenza patients appeared during the 1918 Spanish H1N1 influenza pandemic. A recent review of these studies suggested this treatment was associated with a halving in mortality (37% to 16%), and that early treatment was associated with greater benefits [16]. The assumption underlying these observations is that neutralizing antiviral antibodies in the plasma preparations modulated the course of viral infection and thereby prevented the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and other complications [16]. These same tenets form the rationale for therapy using the mAbs generated in this study, with the potential of a scaleable therapeutic product free of adventitious agents. The strengths of the approach for human mAb generation described here are: (1) it uses the human immune response rather than that of animal surrogates\u2014the antibodies selected will be those that have been generated in response to the natural infectious pathogen and have protected the individual, (2) it is fast, (3) screening can be performed using functional assays, i.e., neutralization, (4) it allows screening of a large repertoire of antibodies to select those with the most favorable profile (potency and breadth of reactivity), and (5) since the antibodies are of human origin the risks of self-reactivity against self-antigens is minimized when compared with antibodies generated in mice or through phage display.",

Similar findings have been previously reported by Gerhard and colleagues who identified a mouse mAb against an influenza A H1 HA that had neutralizing activity in vivo but not in vitro [26,27].
