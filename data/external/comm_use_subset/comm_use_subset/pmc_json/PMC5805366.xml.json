These cytokines also have important roles in immune-surveillance for malignant cells [10,11]. IFN-\u03b3, a type II IFN, binds to a cell-surface receptor, which is known as the type II IFN receptor [12\u201314]. Upon viral infection, IFN-\u03b3 [15,16] activates cellular signaling networks, such as the JAK\u2013STAT pathway [17,18]. The transcription of type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3)-dependent genes is regulated by gamma-activated sequence (GAS) elements, and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein, STAT1 is the most important transcription factor for the regulation of these transcriptional responses. After JAK1 and JAK2 are activated via the binding of IFN-\u03b3 to its receptor, they then regulate the downstream phosphorylation of STAT1 to form STAT1\u2013STAT1 homodimers. The homodimers are transported to the nucleus and bind to GAS elements to induce transcription of various interferon stimulated genes [19\u201322].",

            "text": "The STAT family of transcription factors regulates many cellular processes including cell growth, apoptosis, immune responses, and oncogenesis [20,23,24]. STATs have been found to interact with various proteins, which help to modulate STAT signaling and mediate crosstalk with other cellular signaling pathways [25,26]. Nmi (N-Myc interactor) is one of these proteins, which was first identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen [27]. Nmi interacts with all STATs except STAT2 [27\u201329], and has been shown to augment STAT-mediated transcription in response to IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 by recruiting transcription factors CBP/p300 and potentiating their interactions with STAT proteins [30]. Because of the vital role of Nmi in IFN-\u03b3 response, it is reasonable to suggest that a virus may encode a protein to modulate Nmi function in order to escape IFN-\u03b3-induced antiviral responses. However, no proteins encoded by any herpesviruses have been reported to modulate Nmi function and diminish IFN-\u03b3 responses, leading to increased viral resistance to IFN-\u03b3 and escape from IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

            "text": "In order to establish persistent and latent infection in healthy individuals, HCMV encodes a large array of proteins that can modulate different components and pathways of the immune responses including MHC antigen presentation and NK cell activation [31\u201333]. For example, HCMV IE1 protein has been shown to interact with STAT proteins (e.g. STAT2) and elicit a type II IFN-like host cell response that depends on activated STAT1 but not interferon-\u03b3 [31,34\u201337]. In this report, we provide the first direct evidence that HCMV UL23 interacts with Nmi and disrupts its interaction with STAT1. UL23 is a virion protein found in the tegument and is expressed in the cytoplasm in HCMV infected cells [38]. However, UL23 is dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells and little is currently known about its function [39]. Binding of UL23 to Nmi resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of Nmi and STAT1 and led to a decreased level of transcription of the IFN-\u03b3 stimulated genes. In IFN-\u03b3 treated cells, HCMV mutants lacking UL23 expression induced much higher levels of transcription of IFN-stimulated genes and were much more sensitive to the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b3 than the parental virus with UL23 expression. Our results suggest that UL23 represents the first herpesvirus-encoded protein that interacts with Nmi and inhibits the transcription of IFN-\u03b3 stimulated genes, leading to HCMV resistance to the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b3. Modulating the function of Nmi may represent a novel mechanism for a herpesvirus to escape from IFN-\u03b3 response and increase its resistance to IFN-\u03b3.",

Of approximately 1 x 107 independent cDNA clones tested, 44 yeast colonies yielded positive results. Of these 44 positive clones, 12 contained plasmid constructs with the full-length and partial coding sequence of Nmi, while each of the remaining 32 clones contained the sequence of a unique human gene (S1 Table). Nmi has been shown to bind to several STAT proteins including STAT1 and induce IFN-\u03b3 induced STAT1-dependent transcription by recruiting transcription factors CBP/p300 and potentiating their interactions with STAT proteins [40\u201342].",

Meanwhile, it is important to study if native (untagged UL23) can interact with endogenous Nmi in human cells during HCMV infection. To determine if this is the case, we used UL23 proteins expressed in E. coli as the antigen to generate an anti-UL23 monoclonal antibody in collaboration with Promab, Inc (Albany, CA). We screened a large number of anti-UL23 antibody-producing clones and selected the clones that generated anti-UL23 antibodies with excellent reactivity and specificity. To determine whether Nmi also interacts with other viral proteins in addition to UL23, we investigated if Nmi is associated with the HCMV polymerase processivity factor, UL44 protein, which is essential for viral DNA replication [4]. Protein lysates from HCMV-infected U251 cells were first either immunoprecipitated with anti-UL23, anti-UL44, or anti-Nmi antibodies, and then immunoblotted with antibodies against UL23, UL44, and Nmi. UL23 was found to be co-precipitated with the endogenous Nmi (Fig 1C and 1D, lanes 19 and 23) while we observed no significant binding or co-precipitation between UL44 and Nmi (Fig 1C and 1D, lanes 13\u201318). These results suggest that Nmi may specifically interact with UL23 but not UL44 during HCMV infection.",

The STAT binding domains of Nmi are in amino acids 57\u201399 and 143\u2013202 [30]. To further map the domains of association between UL23 and Nmi, a series of truncation mutants of UL23 and Nmi were constructed (Fig 2) and yeast two-hybrid analyses were carried out to investigate the binary interactions of mutants and full-length proteins (S1 Fig). We also constructed a series of UL23 and FLAG-tagged Nmi truncation mutants (Fig 2, Table 1). Co-IP experiments were carried out to examine the interactions between UL23 and different FLAG-tagged Nmi mutants after the FLAG tagged constructs were transfected into U251 cells. The results, summarized in Fig 2A, indicate that the minimal Nmi mutant that binds to UL23 contains amino acid 199 to 292 and covers the NID2 domain. These results suggest that amino acids 199\u2013292 of Nmi bearing the NID2 domain, a critical domain for Nmi homo-and hetero-dimerization [40,47], is necessary for its association with UL23. Similarly, experiments were performed to study the association of Nmi and a series of truncated FLAG-tagged UL23 (Fig 2B, S1 Fig). The results showed that the minimal UL23 mutant containing amino acids 129 to 284 was capable of binding to Nmi and mutant with carboxyl-terminal deletion from amino acid 179 to 284 failed to bind to UL23 (Fig 2B). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal sequence of UL23 is essential for its interaction with Nmi.",

Furthermore, rescued viral mutants, R-\u0394UL23 and R-stop, were generated from \u0394UL23 and UL23stop, by restoring the UL23 expression, respectively, following the procedures as described previously [39]. U251 cells were treated with IFN-\u03b3 and then infected with these viruses. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interactions of Nmi with UL23 in TowneBAC infected cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 (Fig 3, lanes 12 and 14). Our results also showed that STAT1 was associated with Nmi in cells infected with \u0394UL23 and UL23stop mutants but not with TowneBAC and rescued viruses R-\u0394UL23 and R-stop (Fig 3, compared lanes 13 and 14, 15 and 16). Similar results were also observed in IFN-\u03b3 treated human foreskin fibroblasts infected with these viruses. These results suggest that binding to Nmi by UL23 abolishes the association of Nmi with STAT1.",

Under certain conditions (e.g. under cellular stress and IFN treatment), Nmi, which binds to multiple STAT proteins and facilitates interactions of these STAT proteins with nuclear transcription factors such as CBP/p300 [48], is localized in the nuclei [25,30,49]. To determine whether UL23 is co-localized with Nmi, the cellular localization of these expressed proteins in U251 and U251-FLAG-UL23 cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 was studied using immunofluorescence microscopy. Consistent with previous observations of Nmi as a nuclear protein [25,30,49], the endogenous Nmi protein was found to localize primarily in the nuclei in U251 cells or U251-FLAG cells (Fig 4, S2 Table). In contrast, FLAG-tagged UL23 and Nmi were primarily localized in the cytoplasm in U251-FLAG-UL23 cells (Fig 4). No obvious fluorescence was observed in control cells not treated with anti-Nmi or anti-FLAG antibody, indicating that the staining observed is specific and not due to secondary antibody binding to viral or cellular proteins. Furthermore, these results suggest that the cellular distribution of Nmi is affected by the presence of UL23, which is primarily localized in the cytoplasm.",

The purity of the fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting for histone H1 (nuclear marker) and actin (cytoplasmic marker) (Fig 5A). In uninfected parental U251 cells, more than 80% of Nmi and STAT1 was found in the nuclei while less than 20% of these proteins was in the cytoplasm (Fig 5A, lanes 2 and 4).

The luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Promoter-3\u00d7GAS and the internal control reporter plasmid pRL-TK were transfected into different cells. At 24 hours post transfection, cells were treated with IFN-\u03b3 and cultured for additional 24 hours. As expected, treatment of IFN-\u03b3 resulted in the augment of IFN-\u03b3-dependent transcription from the reporter construct in U251 and U251-C cells, which contained the control empty vector pCDNA (Fig 6A). However, much less increase of IFN-\u03b3-dependent transcription was observed from the reporter construct in U251-UL23 cells that expressed UL23 (Fig 6A). In the second set of experiments, we examined the effect of UL23 on the expression of HLA-B, IRF1, and IFIT3 genes, which are regulated by IFN-\u03b3 [10,24]. As shown in Fig 6B and 6D, the mRNA levels of these genes induced by IFN-\u03b3 were much less in U251-UL23 cells than those of parental U251 cells and control U251-C cells. These results suggest that UL23 inhibits the induction of the transcription of IFN-\u03b3 stimulated genes mediated by the interaction between Nmi and STAT1, possibly by modulating cellular localization of Nmi and STAT1.",

Different cells (e.g. U251, U251-C, and U251-UL23) were transfected with siRNA molecules that target the Nmi mRNA (anti-Nmi siRNA) or do not recognize any viral or cellular transcripts (control siRNA), respectively. Treatment with anti-Nmi siRNA substantially reduced the expression of Nmi in these cells (Fig 7, compare lanes 5\u20138 with lanes 1\u20134). At 24 hours after siRNA transfection, cells were further transfected with pGL3-Promoter-3\u00d7GAS and pRL-TK and treated with IFN-\u03b3. Downregulation of Nmi expression mediated by siRNA decreased the IFN-\u03b3-induced transcription in U251 and U251-C cells (Fig 7). However, anti-Nmi siRNA did not further decrease the IFN-\u03b3-induced transcription in U251-UL23 cells, which expressed UL23 (Fig 7). These results are consistent with our results that UL23 modulates the level of IFN-\u03b3-induced transcription by interacting with Nmi and disrupting its interaction with STAT1.",

Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that viral mutants lacking UL23 expression may induce higher IFN-\u03b3-dependent transcription and exhibit less resistance to IFN-\u03b3 than the parental virus and rescued viruses that express UL23. To determine if this is the case, cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Promoter-3\u00d7GAS and the internal control reporter plasmid pRL-TK, treated with IFN-\u03b3, and then infected with different viral mutants. At 12 hours postinfection, treatment of IFN-\u03b3 led to significant induction of luciferase activity from the reporter construct in mock-infected cells as well as in cells infected with UL23-deficient mutants, \u0394UL23 and UL23stop (Fig 8A). In contrast, infection of parental TowneBAC and rescued viruses R-\u0394UL23 and R-Stop, which expressed UL23 protein, suppressed the IFN-\u03b3-mediated induction of the luciferase activity from the reporter construct (Fig 8A). The IFN-\u03b3-mediated induction of the luciferase activity as observed in mock-infected U251 cells and cells infected \u0394UL23 and UL23stop was not found in mock-infected U251-UL23 cells and U251-UL23 cells infected with these viral mutants, suggesting that UL23 expression inhibited the IFN-\u03b3-mediated induction (Fig 8A). Similar results were also observed when the transcription levels of IFN-\u03b3 stimulated genes IRF1, IFP35, and IFI44 were assayed in cells infected with these viruses (Fig 8B and 8D). These results suggest that IFN-\u03b3 induced transcription can be inhibited by UL23 in the context of HCMV infection.",

If UL23 blocks IFN-\u03b3 induced transcription responses during HCMV infection, it is conceivable that HCMV mutants lacking UL23 expression may be more susceptible to IFN-\u03b3 treatment and exhibit less growth than the parental and rescued viruses that express UL23. To determine if this is the case, different cells were either pretreated with IFN-\u03b3 or not, and then infected with viruses. Growth of different viral mutants in these cells was studied. In the absence of IFN-\u03b3 treatment, mutants \u0394UL23 and UL23stop exhibited similar titers as the parental strain TowneBAC and the control revertant viruses R-\u0394UL23 and R-stop (Fig 9A), consistent with previous observations that UL23 is dispensable for viral lytic infection [39]. However, upon treatment of IFN-\u03b3, UL23-minus mutants, \u0394UL23 and UL23stop, exhibited a peak titer of at least 5,000 fold lower than TowneBAC and revertant viruses R-\u0394UL23 and R-stop in U251 and U251-C cells (Fig 9B). To further determine the role of UL23, we repeated the experiments using U251-UL23 cells. We observed no difference in the titers of TowneBAC, \u0394UL23, UL23-stop, R-\u0394UL23, and R-UL23-stop in U251-UL23 cells pre-treated with IFN-\u03b3 (Fig 9B). These results suggest that UL23 blocks IFN-\u03b3 induced response and increases viral resistance to IFN-\u03b3 during viral infection, possibly by interacting with Nmi and modulating the cellular localization of STAT1 protein.",

Understanding the mechanism of how human viruses modulate IFN responses to achieve successful infection will facilitate the development of novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of human viral infections. In this study, we provide the first direct evidence that HCMV UL23 protein specifically interacts with human N-myc interactor (Nmi) protein. We identified this interaction through a yeast two-hybrid screen and co-immunoprecipitation in human cells. We also showed that Nmi, when bound to UL23, was not associated with STAT1, suggesting that UL23 binding of Nmi disrupts the interactions of Nmi with STAT1. In IFN-\u03b3 treated cells overexpressing UL23, we observed (a) significant reduced levels of Nmi and STAT1 in the nuclei, the sites where these proteins act to induce transcription of IFN-\u03b3 stimulated genes, and (b) decreased levels of the induction of the transcription of IFN-\u03b3 stimulated genes. UL23-deficient HCMV mutants induced higher transcription of IFN-\u03b3 stimulated genes and exhibited lower titers than parental and control revertant viruses expressing a functional UL23 in IFN-\u03b3 treated cells. These results suggest that UL23 functions to bind to Nmi and reduce the nuclear import and the availability of Nmi and its associated protein STAT1 for the activation of IFN-\u03b3 stimulated gene transcription, leading to a decrease of IFN-\u03b3 dependent responses and an increase of viral resistance to IFN-\u03b3.",

First, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Nmi interacted with the HA-tagged UL23 but not the negative control, UL70, suggesting that Nmi does not bind to the tag sequence (Fig 1A and 1B). Second, Nmi co-immunoprecipitated with untagged native UL23 but not UL44 in HCMV-infected cells, demonstrating that the interaction with UL23 during HCMV infection is specific (Fig 1C and 1D). Third, both tagged and untagged UL23 protein co-localized with Nmi (Figs 4 and 5, S2 Table). These results suggest that (1) the tag sequence does not enhance or interfere with the interaction of Nmi and UL23, (2) the interaction is specific, and (3) the observations from experiments with the tagged UL23 protein may be representative of those obtained with the native untagged protein during HCMV infection.",

Nonprofessional antigen presenting cells have been shown to express MHC II molecules upon IFN-\u03b3 stimulation and subsequently present viral antigens including HCMV IE1 peptides [51]. IFN-\u03b3 produced by CD4+ T cells can block HCMV replication in vitro, highlighting the important role of IFN-\u03b3 in controlling HCMV infection [50]. It has been further shown that IFN-\u03b3 is more potent than IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b2 against HCMV and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), and type I and II IFNs act synergistically when administered in combination [10]. Consistent with these previous observations, our experiments showed that a reduction of more than 50 fold in viral titers was observed in HCMV infected cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 compared to those untreated cells (Fig 9).",

By targeting different steps during the IFN response at different time points of the infection, viruses can counteract IFN responses by interfering with the IFN downstream signaling and become resistant against existing IFN. Viruses can also express evasins targeting IFN induction within the infected cells to avoid the priming of bystander cells. For example, HCMV IE1 proteins have been shown to bind with STAT proteins (e.g. STAT2) and these interactions diminish DNA binding of the ternary ISGF3 complex to promoters of type I ISGs, leading to inhibition of transcription activation of human IFN stimulated genes including ISG54, PKR, and CXCL10 [31,34\u201337]. Recent studies have also shown that IE1 can elicit a Type II interferon-like host cell response that depends on activated STAT1 but not IFN-\u03b3 [35]. Moreover, it has been recently reported that IE1 can rewire upstream IL6-type to downstream IFN-\u03b3-like signaling, two pathways linked to opposing effects, resulting in repressed STAT3- and activated STAT1-responsive genes [52]. MCMV also encodes a viral protein, M27, which modulates IFN signaling and confers IFN resistance [53]. M27 can bind to STAT2 protein and block STAT2-mediated IFN-\u03b3 signaling and antiviral responses by recruiting DNA-damage DNA-binding protein (DDB) 1, a host ubiquitin ligase complex adaptor protein, for targeting STAT2 for proteasome degradation [53,54]. However, no proteins encoded by herpesviruses including CMV have been reported to interact with Nmi and modulate Nmi-mediated immune responses. Our study provides the first direct evidence that a herpesvirus encodes a viral protein that specifically binds to Nmi and modulates signaling steps of IFN-\u03b3 responses mediated by Nmi.",

During Sendai virus infection, Nmi can bind to IRF7, a master regulator for Type I IFN-dependent immune responses, and target IRF7 for proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to inhibition of Type I IFN responses induced by viral infections [56]. In recent studies, a miRNA encoded by torque teno virus (TTV) targets Nmi expression to inhibit type II interferon signaling and promote immune evasion [57] while protein 6 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can bind to Nmi and promote its degradation [58]. These results suggest the critical roles of Nmi in controlling infections of these viruses and possibly, other human viruses. Consistent with these observations, we showed (a) that over-expression of UL23 modulated the cellular localization of Nmi and its associated protein STAT1 and inhibited IFN-\u03b3 signaling mediated by Nmi and STAT1 and (b) that UL23-deficient mutants induced much higher IFN-\u03b3 responses and were more susceptible to IFN-\u03b3 antiviral effects. These results highlight the important roles of Nmi in human anti-HCMV immune responses and roles of UL23-Nmi interactions in conferring resistance to IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

As Nmi interacts with multiple STAT proteins, it is conceivable that UL23 may affect the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responsive genes in addition to the expression of IFN-\u03b3 responsive genes as shown in this study (Figs 6 and 8).

Further studies on these issues will elucidate the roles of UL23 in interfering with host type I and type II IFN responses and facilitating HCMV infection and replication.",

However, we observed no positive interaction between Nmi and more than 100 HCMV ORFs other than UL23 in our yeast two hybrid screen experiments [44]. UL23-mediated inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 induced gene transcription can be mimicked by suppressing Nmi expression using anti-Nmi siRNAs (Fig 7), and UL23-deficient viral mutants (i.e. \u0394UL23 and UL23stop) exhibited significantly more IFN-\u03b3 responses than parental virus TowneBAC. While we cannot completely exclude the possibility that Nmi may affect the IFN-\u03b3 responses by interacting with HCMV proteins other than UL23, our results in experiments expressing UL23 alone in the absence of HCMV infection and in experiments using anti-Nmi siRNA and UL23-deficient mutants suggest that UL23 may interact with Nmi and affect its cellular localization and interactions with STAT1 in the absence of other HCMV proteins, possibly leading to the inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 induced STAT1-dependent transcription. The coding sequences of more than 30 human proteins other than Nmi were also found to interact potentially with UL23 in our yeast two hybrid assays (S1 Table). To confirm the interactions of these proteins with UL23, we will perform additional experiments (e.g. co-immunoprecipitation) and these results will elucidate the effects of other human proteins on UL23 function during HCMV infection.",

It may be important to investigate the function of UL23 in fibroblasts, which are fully permissive and commonly used to study HCMV infection [4]. However, due to poor transfection efficiency in fibroblasts, it is technically difficult to carry out similar experiments in these cells. Moreover, it is not feasible to constitutively express high level of UL23 over many passages in fibroblasts because they are primary cells. In contrast, the neuronal origin U251 cells are permissive to HCMV infection and have been used to study HCMV previously [4,59,60]. As these cells are immortalized, U251 cell lines that constitutively express UL23 can be easily generated.

The minimal Nmi mutant that binds to UL23 contains amino acid 199 to 292 and covers the NID2 domain critical for Nmi homo-and hetero-dimerization [40,47], which partially overlaps with the binding domains to STAT proteins (Fig 2). Perhaps UL23 may compete for binding to the same Nmi regions as STAT1. It is also possible that binding of UL23 may affect the conformation of Nmi, leading to inhibition of its binding to STAT1.",

            "text": "HCMV IE1 proteins have been shown to bind with STAT proteins (e.g. STAT2) and these interactions diminish DNA binding of the ternary ISGF3 complex to promoters of type I ISGs, leading to inhibition of transcription activation of human IFN stimulated genes including PKR, CXCL10, and ISG54 [31,34\u201337]. Recent studies have also shown that IE1 can elicit a Type II interferon-like host cell response that depends on activated STAT1 but not IFN-\u03b3 [35]. Moreover, it has been recently reported that IE1 can rewire upstream IL6-type to downstream IFN-\u03b3-like signaling, two pathways linked to opposing effects, resulting in repressed STAT3- and activated STAT1-responsive genes [52]. The common impacts on STAT1 by IE1 and UL23 via different pathways, represent an interesting and potentially important regulatory mechanism of host responses during HCMV infection. UL23 encodes a tegument protein and IE1 is an immediately early protein [31,34\u201338]. HCMV IE1 is dispensable for replication of a UL23 competent virus under high multiplicity of infection (MOI) conditions while UL23 is not essential for replication of an IE1 competent virus in cultured cells [39, 61]. It is possible that UL23-mediated modulation of STAT1 signaling is enhanced or repressed by IE1-mediated effect on STAT1 function. Further studies on these issues may elucidate the potential roles of the impact on the STAT1 signaling by these two HCMV proteins in supporting HCMV infection.",

            "text": "How STAT1 protein is retained in the cytoplasm in the presence of UL23 is currently unknown, given the fact that UL23 binds to Nmi and disrupts Nmi interaction with STAT1. While phosphorylation of STAT1 is required for its nuclear localization, the mechanism of the nuclear import of STAT1 is not completely understood [20,23,24]. Our results showed that Nmi and STAT1 interacted with each other and localized in the nuclei in IFN-\u03b3 treated cells. However, in the presence of UL23, these two proteins failed to interact with each other and were localized in the cytoplasm (Figs 4 and 5). It is conceivable that Nmi or Nmi-associated proteins facilitate STAT1 nuclear import by recruiting STAT1 to the Nmi-containing complex that may contain the protein carriers for STAT1 nuclear import. Binding of Nmi by UL23 disrupts the interactions of STAT1 with Nmi, and may block the association of STAT1 with the Nmi-containing complex that contains the protein carriers for STAT1 nuclear import, leading to its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Detailed characterization of the nuclear import processes of Nmi and STAT1 proteins should clarify these issues. Further studies on the interactions of UL23 with Nmi and the effects of these interactions on Nmi-associated proteins will provide insight into the mechanism of how Nmi and its mediated immune responses play a role in combatting viral infections in a host and how viruses such as HCMV develop novel strategies to escape from or counteract against these immune responses including those Nmi-mediated IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

A two-step mutagenesis protocol was used to construct mutant UL23stop, which contained a stop codon immediately downstream from the UL23 translation initiation site. In the first step, we inserted at the UL23 translation initiation codon with a cassette (tet/str) containing the tetracycline resistance gene tetA and rpsL gene conferring streptomycin susceptibility, following the mutagenesis procedures as described previously [39]. The bacteria harboring the mutant BAC constructs were electroporated with the PCR-amplified tet/str cassette. Successful insertion of the tet/str cassette was screened by selecting for bacterial colonies resistant to tetracycline. In the second step, the tet/str cassette was targeted for deletion and replacement by the mutated UL23 sequence that contained a stop codon immediately downstream from the translation initiation site. The resulting mutant, which only contained the mutated UL23 sequence and would not contain the cassette, was streptomycin-resistant and, therefore, was easily selected in the presence of the antibiotics [39]. Rescued mutants R-\u0394UL23 and R-stop were generated from \u0394UL23 and UL23stop, respectively, following the experimental procedures for construction of rescued viruses as described previously [39]. The UL23 region in the mutants and the rescued viruses was analyzed by restriction digestion profile and sequencing analyses. The expression of UL23 in cells infected with these mutants was studied by Western blot analysis using the anti-UL23 antibody.",
