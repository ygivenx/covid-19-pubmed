The aetiology in specific herd-cases may differ and is often incompletely diagnosed. Until recently, this complexity was not of major practical concern, since most problems could be controlled by vaccination or antibiotics. Around 2008, however, a new syndrome that did not respond to antibiotics or commercial vaccines seemed to emerge (\n[1] + Personal communications, S.E. Jorsal, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark and B. Svensmark, Pig Research Centre, Danish Agriculture & Food Council, Denmark). The number of affected herds is unknown, but 80% of Danish swine practitioners report to experience these problems\n[1].",

However, important limitations of the study that are relevant in the interpretation of its results need to be mentioned. An obvious limitation of the study was the fact that piglets were only examined for five days. Thus, the definition on NNPDS used in the study was made on practical grounds and should not be interpreted as if NNPDS does not occur beyond the fifth day of life. In fact, 25-50% of piglets within herds started having symptoms on the fourth or fifth day of life, and some of them were probably diarrhoeic beyond the period of examination.",

In the other herds, the association with parity was weaker, but still significant. An association with young sows is in line with previous studies on suckling piglet and neonatal diarrhoea\n[3,7,8]. Different factors, such as lower levels of colostral antibodies\n[9], differences in milk composition\n[10] and stressful behaviour in first parity sows\n[11] may explain this association. Although no specific microorganism has been identified in the pathogenesis of NNPDS the overrepresentation of first parity litters may be due to lack of specific colostral immunity of a yet unknown infectious agent. It seems intriguing to interpret a tendency to cluster within litters (as seen in Herd 1 and 2) as an indication of the syndrome being of infectious nature. However, inborn (genetic or developmental) and environmental factors are also likely to cluster within litters, thus could also be a part of the explanation.",

The decision to draw this sharp line was made on practical grounds, in order to be able to evaluate the hypothesis of liquid faeces on the day of birth being unrelated to the syndrome.
