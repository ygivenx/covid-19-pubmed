The disease is characterized by abortions and weak born piglets, increased mortality in suckling and weaned piglets, and respiratory disease in weaners and finishers [4, 5]. This disease is caused by the PRRS-virus (PRRSV) and this virus also aggravates infections like Influenza A, Streptococcus suis and porcine respiratory coronavirus infections [1]. PRRSV belongs to the Arteriviridae family within the order Nidovirales and contains a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome ranging from 14.9 to 15.5 Kb in length [6, 7]. PRRSV is divided into two genotypes, PRRSV-1, and PRRSV-2 [8]. Both types share only about 50\u201360% and there is considerable sequence variability within each type [9\u201312]. Both subtypes now have a worldwide distribution [10, 13\u201316].",

Downstream, ORF2, ORF3 and ORF4 encode for the minor structural glycoproteins GP2, GP3 and GP4, respectively and together these proteins form a trimeric complex that is heavily N-glycosylated and functions in viral entry [17]. In addition to GP2, ORF2 encodes an alternative reading frame (ORF2b) for a small unglycosylated envelope protein (E) [18]. Further downstream, ORF5, ORF6 and ORF7 encode for the major structural proteins GP5, matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N), respectively [17]. Besides the N-glycosylated GP5, that is involved in cell attachment, another small unglycosylated protein that is required for virus viability is translated from an alternative reading frame of ORF5, designated ORF5a [19].",

The remarkable genetic variation of PRRSV [20\u201322], makes epidemiological and molecular analysis of this virus of high importance to monitor changes of these circulating viruses. Consequently, it is also important to review current diagnostic tools since the variability of PRRSV has impact on the sensitivity and specificity of used ELISAs and PCR tests and may affect vaccine efficacy. Of the Dutch pigs, approximately 95% of the sows and 30% of the piglets is vaccinated with either modified life vaccine (MLV) Porcilis PRRS (MSD), Reprocyc/PRRSFLEX EU (Boehringer Ingelheim), Unistrain (Hipra) or Suvaxyn MLV PRRS (Zoetis). In addition, on a few sow farms the inactivated vaccine Progressis (CEVA) is used.",

These studies showed a phylogenetic analysis of ORF5 sequences of Dutch strains from 2004\u20132009 and concluded that the average sequence similarity with Lelystad virus (<90%) is decreasing over the years. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate circulating PRRS-viruses in the Netherlands in 2014, 2015 and 2016 on an extensive molecular level by sequencing ORF2, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5, ORF6 and ORF7. Subsequently, these sequences are compared to PRRSV sequences originating from other European countries and available in GenBank in order to investigate genetic relatedness.",

This manuscript describes the first extensive molecular study about Dutch PRRS viruses since its first description in the early nineties. The results demonstrate that all 74 PRRSV strains belong to PRRSV-1 (Fig 1), but the diversity among strains is high, based on the nucleotide identity (S1 appendix and S2 Table), individual ORF length (Fig 2 and S3 Table) and phylogenetic trees of individual ORFs (Fig 3). Furthermore, the most investigated viruses in this study form a distinct Dutch cluster based on ORF2-ORF7 sequences (Fig 1). The Netherlands is exporting approximately 10 million and importing half a million live pigs per year [37] and is endemic for PRRSV, like many other countries in Europe. Therefore, it is expected that with the animals, PRRS virus strains spread over these countries. Sampling bias is a probable clarification for this as many countries do not sequence and/or deposit their sequences in GenBank, resulting in incomplete databases for ORF2-ORF7. With an economic high impact disease like PRRS across country borders, monitoring of circulating viruses is an important tool that would greatly benefit from more frequent sharing of sequence data by different European countries, including the Netherlands.",

Even after designing two additional forward primers, not for all PRRSV isolates ORF2-ORF7 amplicons could be generated.

The data presented here shows that the phylogenetic topology of some viruses is ORF dependent, as also previously described [44]. For example, based on ORF5 alone, NL/GD-5-18/2015 would be categorized as a field virus (Fig 3D), whereas based on ORF6 or ORF7 the collected virus would be designated as a vaccine virus derivative (Fig 3E and 3F). A possible explanation for this ORF dependent clustering in phylogenetic trees is recombination [17]. PRRSV strains can recombine if coinfection of a cell with two or more strains occurs. So, the identity of a given PRRSV strain is largely incomplete if only ORF5 or ORF7 are known. Although whole genome sequencing of the PRRS viruses may give a more complete picture in support of the molecular epidemiology, sequencing ORF2-ORF7 is already an enormous improvement for PRRSV routine sequencing. Based on one ORF alone, the identity of the strain of interest might be misinterpreted and wrong conclusions may be drawn in a diagnostic and epidemiological perspective, as also recently observed [45].",

The 3\u2019-end of this region is prone for deletions as previously described [43, 44] and the deletions found in the present study always affected the open reading frame of ORF4. Not only the variation in nucleotide identity compared to the Lelystad strain (S1 appendix) was high, but the viruses studied varied also in their ORF3 length (Fig 2). In addition, another eight variants in length were observed at the other ORF3 (non-Dutch) sequences from GenBank used in Fig 1: 744, 750, 762, 765, 774, 780, 786 and 792 nucleotides, respectively. Although it is suggested that viruses with ORF3 deletions will be outcompeting nondeleted viruses in the field [43], our results show that besides shorter ORF3 genes, also longer ORF3 genes compared to Lelystad virus were observed (Fig 2). For ORF4, three variants in the Dutch strains (Fig 2) were observed, whereas the used GenBank sequences in Fig 1 contain another seven variants in length: 516, 519, 528, 534, 540, 546 and 555 nucleotides, respectively. The variation in length of ORF4 can be explained by the fact that the 5\u2019-end of ORF4 and the 3\u2019-end of ORF3 coding regions overlap and hence any deletion found in ORF3 will also affect ORF4 [47].",
