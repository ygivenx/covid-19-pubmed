In contrast to adults, young children infected with MTB are more likely to progress to ATB within the first year of primary infection; however, the molecular mechanisms behind this have long been a mystery [3].",

For instance, Shuxian Li et al. revealed that the proteins secreted by A549 cells were associated with the infection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae [6]. Dandan Xu and her colleagues found that the level of serum proteins (S100A9, SOD3, and MMP9) in ATB reflected the immune response to the MTB infection [5].

According to the analysis of BP, the primary functions were cellular processes, metabolic processes and biological regulation; while others were related to cellular component organization, pigmentation, multicellular organismal processes and so on. According to the analysis of MF, these proteins could be classified into eight categories as follows: molecular transducer activity, translation regulator activity, enzyme regulator activity, transcription regulator activity, structural molecule activity, catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity. Among them, a large proportion had binding as a molecular function.

Similarly, plasma proteins also have profound effects on a variety of infectious diseases.

Among these proteins, 49 were differentially expressed between LTBI and ATB. These proteins were further performed by volcano plot. The traditional volcano plot is a combination of fold change and t-tests. Note, for unpaired samples, the x-axis is log (FC).

XRCC4 is an important component of non-homologous end-joining [24]. The expression of this gene is associated with many infectious diseases, including HSV-1 [25, 26]. In addition, PCF11serves as a target for regulated transcription and pre-mRNA processing. Recent studies showed that it is also involved in regulated transcription initiation, elongation, termination and alternative processing of pre-mRNA [27\u201329]. SEMA4A is expressed by dendritic cells, macrophages, and activated T cells [30, 31]. It is involved in co-stimulation in helper T cell proliferation and cytokine production [32, 33]. Higher levels of SEMA4A in ATB group implied the higher T cell activation in MTB infection than in LTBI. ATP11A, a member of P4-ATPases, is a lipid flippase [34]. A previous study demonstrated that lipid flippases are essential to mediate the endotoxin-induced endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4 in human macrophages. Macrophages play a primary role in TB transmission [35]. MTB usually replicates within macrophages and spreads to pulmonary lymph nodes. Furthermore, lipid flippase is also important to dampen the inflammatory response, implying that ATP11A had an important effect in MTB infection. Our results indicate, for the first time, that the expression of these proteins were also correlated with the conversion from LTBI to ATB in children.",

The LC-MS/MS system consisted of an Agilent 1100 quaternary HPLC (EASY-nLC1000) and a micrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA) with the application of a distal 180\u00b0C source temperature. A RP trapcolumn (Thermo EASY column SC200 150\u03bcm\u00d7100mm) was used for desalting, and a C18 reverse-phase column (Thermo EASY column SC001 traps 150\u03bcm \u00d7 20mm) was used for separation. Mobile phase A consisted of HPLC-grade water containing 0.1% formic acid (FA), and phase B consisted of 84% HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1% FA. The analytical separation was run at a flow rate of 400 nl/min using a linear gradient of phase B as follows: 0\u201345% for 100 min, 45\u2013100% for 8 min and 100% for 12 min. To reduce the technical variation the analyses were repeated three times [37]. Peptide spectral matches (PSMs) were validated using the percolator provided by the Proteome Discoverer software based on q-values at a 1% false discovery rate.",
