The initial manifestation of arthritis was erythema and swelling of ankle joints, followed by the inflammation of the metatarsal and inter-phalangeal joints. Disease progression can be evaluated by measuring paw swelling volume, which is an indicator of the degree of inflammation. In order to evaluate the anti-arthritic efficacy of RL, the paw volume changes were quantified using plethysmometry. At all three doses, RL significantly ameliorated paw swelling. At the end of the experiment, more significant reductions of paw volume were observed in groups treated with RL (660 mg/kg) and indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used as the positive control (Fig. 1A).",

Increased expression/activities of these TLR4 signalling components (TAK1, NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and IRF3) in CIA rats demonstrated their involvement in the pathology of CIA. RL reduced the upregulated protein levels of TLR4, phospho-TAK1, phospho-NF-\u03baB p65, phospho-c-Jun and phospho-IRF3 in CIA joint tissues (Fig. 4A,B). Upon ligand binding, TLR4 recruits several adaptors which lead to activation of TAK1. Transcription of NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and IRF3 initiates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, which contribute to the pathogenesis of CIA. RL mitigated the upregulated levels of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, while elevated the levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in both sera and joint tissue lysates (Figs 4C and 5A\u2013D).

RL significantly mitigated the levels of IL-17 in both sera and joint tissue lysates of CIA rats (Fig. 7A,B). Studies showed that the splenic proportion of pathogenic Th17 cells, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA31, correlated directly with the levels of serum IL-17 in arthritic mice32. In line with decreasing serum IL-17, RL also reduced Th17 cell proportion in splenocytes (Fig. 7C,D) and inhibited IL-17A production in PMA-and-ionomycin-activated splenocytes isolated from CIA rats (Fig. 7E). The humoral response against autoantigen is essential for the development of erosive arthritis33. RL inhibited CII-stimulated proliferation of splenocytes isolated from CIA rats (Fig. 8A) and significantly reduced the IgG antibody level in sera (Fig. 8B).",

            "text": "Several studies have proposed novel strategies for the treatment of RA and CIA by regulating the activities of immune cells as well as the levels of certain cytokines (e.g. TNF-\u03b1, GMCSF, IL-17)3839. The TLR4 signalling pathway, which regulates a wide range of proinflammatory cytokines and the activities of various immune cells, is believed to be one of the novel therapeutic targets in RA management1112. We previously reported that RL could inhibit various TLR4 signalling components23. Therefore, we investigated RL\u2019s effects on TLR4 signalling-related events in CIA rats, in which TLR4 can be activated by ligands from damaged synovial tissues6. Upon ligand binding, TLR4 signalling activates transcription factors NF-\u03baB (p50/p65 heterodimer), AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer) and IRF34041. Activation of these transcription factors results in the production of inflammatory mediators e.g. IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, providing a positive feedback to the TLR4 signalling pathways, which results in persistent inflammation and favours the induction of autoimmunity42. In this study, we found that RL could inhibit TLR4 signalling. This was demonstrated by the suppressed protein expressions of TLR4, phospho-TAK1, phospho-NF-\u03baB p65, phospho-c-Jun, and phospho-IRF3 in joint tissues. Phosphorylation of the key transcription factors of TLR4 signalling is essential to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. RL\u2019s inhibition on TLR4 signalling was also evidenced by the reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines regulated by the transcription factors NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and IRF3 in sera and joint tissues of CIA rats. These pro-inflammatory cytokines could induce oxidative stress, leading to declined activities of endogenous antioxidants. RL rejuvenated the declined activities of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px) in sera and liver tissues of CIA rats. TLR4 signalling also takes part in immune responses43. Production of autoimmune antibodies and IL-17 upon collagen immunization was found to be less in TLR4-deficient mice than in wild type mice6. In the present study, RL was found to be able to lower the levels of IL-17 in sera and joint tissues of CIA rats. This observation was supported by the reduction of pathogenic Th17 cells and IL-17 production in spleen cells. In addition, RL could reduce the IgG antibody production and inhibit antigen-stimulated proliferation of splenocytes. These suggest that attenuation of TLR4 signalling is possibly one of the molecular mechanisms for the anti-arthritic effects of RL in CIA rats (Fig. 9). Reduction in the proportions of Th17 cells may also be responsible for the effects of RL. Several studies have demonstrated that besides the Th17 cells, modulating the activities of other immune cells (e.g. macrophages, monocytes, B cells, dendritic cells, Treg cells) may also be a potential therapeutic approach in RA management44454647. Because of the multi-component and multi-target natures of Chinese medicines, we believe that this herbal formula may also affect other immune cells. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of this formula on other signalling pathways as well as other components of the immune system.",

Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into six groups of eight. Five groups were immunized intradermally, at the base of the tail and the back, with 200 \u03bcg bovine type II collagen (Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA) in 0.05 M acetic acid emulsified with equal volume incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (IFA) (Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA) on day 0. A boost injection of 100 \u03bcg collagen-IFA suspension was given in the same manner on day 7.
