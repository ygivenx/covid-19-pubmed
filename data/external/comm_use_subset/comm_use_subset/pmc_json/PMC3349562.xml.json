The World Health Organization (WHO) TB strategy, brand named \"DOTS\", is based on five essential elements: political commitment; case detection using sputum microscopy; standardized short course chemotherapy; regular drug supply; and monitoring and evaluation [1]. WHO and International Union against TB and Lung Disease (IUATLD) have strongly recommended that TB and other disease control programmes should be closely integrated within wider health systems. However, in many countries national TB programmes function vertically as part of the communicable disease control system, operating outside the existing health care structures [2]. Raviglione and Pio suggest that this integration should be through \"a pragmatic approach combining a specialized, well defined management system with a fully integrated service delivery\" [3]. Unger et al defines integration as \"a process where disease control activities are functionally merged or tightly coordinated with multifunctional health care delivery\" [4]. In particular within this paper, integration is used to describe the inclusion of TB control activities, especially clinical services, into general health services.",

Involving public and private hospitals for effective TB programme delivery is part of WHO's Stop TB strategy called Public-Private Mix (PPM)-DOTS [6]. Although integration of TB services within public and private hospitals in many African countries has been achieved, this has been less successful in parts of Asia where hospitals were not included in initial plans for rapid TB service expansion [7]. Indonesia is one example of an Asian country where DOTS is increasingly included within public and private hospitals [8-11]. Despite the successful scale-up, hospitals have reported lower cure and success rates, compared to chest clinics and health centres [8], with a large proportion of patients not treated with standardized diagnosis and treatment [9]. In order to strengthen integration of DOTS within hospitals, a combination of strong individual commitment of health professionals, organizational supports, partnership governance, and relevant policy is required [9].",

The national CDC, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, provides technical support and routine management of disease control programmes, including the National TB Programme (NTP).

The inadequate control of TB was related to a malfunctioning health system, which resulted from the transition to a market economy and financial decentralization in the mid-1980s [14]. Since then, health funding and management responsibilities were decentralized from central and provincial governments, to county and township governments [15]. Due to diminished government funding, both the hospital sector (largely public) and public health organizations had to rely on providing additional services and selling drugs to subsidize their total income [14]. During this time, TB control, as with many other public health activities, was neglected as it was labor intensive and created little income [12]. Where TB diagnosis and treatment was provided for free, many CDCs charged patients for additional tests and drugs, often with uncertain benefit [12,16].",

Although GFATM supported districts might exist, we purposefully selected districts which initiated the integrated model on their own initiative, as a bottom-up approach was thought to be more replicable and sustainable. At the time of this study, very few districts in China had implemented the integrated model. Thus research sites were pragmatically selected, considering the availability of the sites and their willingness to participate. Finally, two districts were selected from the database of the China National TB Programme. One was Changning, a district of Shanghai (SC), and another was Nanning, the capital city of Guangxi(GN). Geographically, they are located in eastern and south western China respectively. SC had much higher GDP per capita and TB expenditure per person than GN. Both sites had similar cure rates of new smear positive TB cases (Table 2). A prefectural general hospital in GN provided TB services since 1996 but it was not until 2005 that TB services were fully integrated in this hospital. In SC, TB services were integrated in a district general hospital in 2007. Under the leadership of health bureaus, the designated hospitals in both sites work with the CDCs at the same levels, and other general health facilities to deliver TB service within their catchments areas.",

However, the economic and political interests might act as a barrier to effective integration of TB control. The more prosperous site (SC) in Eastern China was more coordinated and thus had a better method of resource allocation and more patient-orientated service, compared with the poorer site (GN) in the West.

Integration not only involves the shift from a specialized organization to a horizontal one, but also a real transfer of responsibilities, rights and duties [30]. In order to achieve this, challenges which affect the motivation of both the CDC and hospital staff for integration should be addressed. Within the CDC, it is important to address the concern arising from the \"loss\" of the TB service. The CDC staff in SC worried about \"losing control and power\" over the vertical service, as operating the service directly was thought to be easier than collaborating with the horizontal health service [30]. In GN, the \"loss\" of the TB service meant losing profit for CDC. This suggests that under-resourcing of the CDC may have been a barrier to supporting integration, particularly true in West China where costs were not fully met by the local government [15,16,18,22]. Within the hospital, historical involvement in TB services, good relationships with the CDC and an encouraging integration environment prior to integration may help to improve the process of integration. Integration itself can sometimes provide positive incentives since provision of TB service may improve reputation and income for hospitals [9]. However, experiences from the two sites suggest a strong political commitment from health bureau is the key to motivate and engage the hospitals.",

The hospital in SC appeared to have more patient-centered care, while the hospital from GN appeared to be more profit-oriented. It is suggested that these differences in mentality were due to differences in resource allocation systems, and security of funding. Following the financial decentralization, performance-based payment systems have been prevalent in Chinese public hospitals, which may have encouraged gaming within the health system to raise additional funds by charging from patients [32]. This approach is not encouraged in the TB clinics, however it is entrenched within practice as operational costs are not fully met by the government. Loss of income due to free TB treatment policy may be a universal concern [11]. Hospital providers may thus comprise the standardised TB treatment through unnecessary prescription of drugs, tests and admissions for general TB patients. These distorted incentives constrain the patient-orientated care provision and can negatively impact on the care of patients. While government funding has largely improved for public health facilities such as CDC, there is an urgent need to increase funding to subsidize the newly integrated public-health services in the hospital. The resource allocation mechanisms in TB control seemed to favor the CDC, and so hospitals may suffer from a \"reallocation\" of the TB control budget from the CDC. Integration requires transfer of funds for care from the CDC to the hospital. An appropriate budgeting mechanism needs to be explored to ensure equitable allocation of resources and successful integration as in the case of SC.",

Recent work in Indonesia suggests that strengthening the collaboration between the TB programme and hospitals by involving hospitals in DOTS implementation has potential to improve TB control [8-11]. Following the integration, the hospital has changed its role from \"reporting and referral\" to clinical service provision, while they are well placed to do so [13]. Integration means making the best of the public health strength of the CDC and clinical strength of the hospital, which requires a higher degree of inter-organizational collaboration to ensure successful integration. A more collaborative and participatory inter-organizational approach was observed in the more affluent Eastern China site. This was probably due to a participatory learning culture and the historically better relationship between the designated hospital and CDC. In the poorer Western China site, however, the CDC and hospital had long-lasting competitive relationship often due to challenges in resource allocation and poor communication. Such competitive relationship may fuel a degree of mistrust, thus damaging the collaboration [11]. Experiences from both sites highlight the importance of dialogue and flexibility [34,35], informal communication [11,36], and good governance [11,34] to sustaining such collaboration. A powerful intermediary actor, such as health bureau can play a positive role in mediating such collaboration [11].",
