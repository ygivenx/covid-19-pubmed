In particular, the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa represents the largest outbreak of Ebola virus to date. Public health interventions have been introduced in all affected countries and show the great effects on the infection. However, the numbers of infected cases from Ebola show a trend of bouncing back after declining in February 2015. Those indicate that the outbreak patterns of Ebola in West Africa become more and more complex, and hence it is important to determine the best model by employing mathematical models and model selection methods, which can be used to estimate and predict the characteristics of emerging infectious diseases.",

Several models have been proposed to estimate basic reproduction number, turning point, and final size by cumulated cases; some of them are based on purely empirical relationship, while others have a theoretical basis and are realized by differential equations. The simplest and commonly applied model among all the infectious disease models is the Richards model [3\u20135]. By employing Richards model, Hsieh et al. investigated the characteristics including basic reproduction number, turning point, and final size for influenza such as H1N1 [3], SARS [4], and Dengue [5] by fitting Richards model to the reported cumulative cases.",

A single wave of infections consisting of a single peak of high incidence, an S-shaped cumulative epidemic curve, and a single turning point of an outbreak can be the best fitting to data using the selected model. Inference and estimation of parameters and their precision are based on the fitted model. Therefore, the interesting questions would be as follows: Can Richards model effectively predict the growth of the cumulative infected population? How to select the best model for fitting the emerging infectious diseases data? Is it possible to predict the turning point and final size and effectively estimate the basic reproduction number which are quite important in the disease control and management?",

The adjusted coefficient of multiple determination that is often used in model selection was found to be a very poor approach [8]. Posada and Buckley [9] pointed out that the Bayesian and Akaikes information criterion (AIC) approaches present several important advantages over other model selection methods. Therefore, in the present work we employ the Bayes factors to select one model from a set of competing models which can capture the underlying disease outbreak best, and further it can be confirmed by calculating AIC values. The basis of the Bayes factor approach to model selection is quantifying the plausibility of each model when the data and the set of candidate models are given. The Bayes factor is a measure of the change from prior model odds to posterior model odds, brought about by the observed data. In this study, we calculate the Bayes factor with the ratio of the selected number of different models and sample from the joint space of product of model and parameters in each model and then estimate the posterior probability of each model using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms.",

Thus, we first estimate the parameter values for each model candidate based on the data sets and then determine the best fitted model to calculate the basic reproduction number R\n0 for A/H1N1 in China and Ebola in different regions of West Africa. The basic reproduction number R\n0 can be obtained from the formula R\n0 = exp(rT) [3, 4], where r denotes the intrinsic growth rate and T is the generation time of disease transmission.",

Precisely estimating this point can allow us to determine either the beginning of a new epidemic phase or the peak of the current epidemic phase, representing the point at which disease control activities take effect or the point at which an epidemic begins to wane naturally, defined by Hsieh et al.

For the purpose of computing R\n0, we employ the mean estimated generation interval of T = 4 days given by Tang et al. [13], which results in the estimation of R\n0 based on Logistic model (i.e., R\n0 = 1.9005 (95% CI (1.8869, 1.9142))). The likelihood-based and compartment model-based estimations of R\n0 are 1.663 (95% CI (1.273, 2.053)) [13] and 1.682 (95% CI (1.446, 1.918)) [11] for the period from 3 September to 21 September with a generation time of four days. All those show that in order to evaluate the emerging infectious disease we could employ the simplest model, because it allows us to identify the model parameter values more quickly and it is actually based on a small number of data points, and this is quite important for public health. The result of t\ni = 23 for Xi'an indicates that the turning point had occurred during 25\u201327 September, 2009. The estimation of final size is 1013 (95% CI (996, 1030)) of the first wave, but it cannot be reached because of the beginning of the second wave.",

The AIC values for both Logistic model and Richards model further indicate that these two models are the best.

It is interesting to notice that the probability for Logistic model is the biggest one and Richards model is the second one, which further confirms that Logistic model is the best model for West Africa data set. In Figure 4(a), it is easy to notice that the best fitted theoretical models are Logistic model and Richards model and the solution curves of Logistic model and Richards model are almost coincident.",

In Liberia, the underestimated rate is bigger than others because the data had changed due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results, and the data of Liberia had significant adjustments. This also is why R\n0 for Liberia is the biggest. Note that the reported accumulated cases including confirmed, probable, and suspected cases in Liberia have been revised largely; for example, there are 4665, 6535, and 6525 cases on October 23, October 27, and November 2, 2014, respectively.

Further, many factors such as differences in population densities, realization of control measure, and mobility of the population among regions led to a wide range of reproduction number. Our estimated reproduction numbers from the hospital notifications are in broad agreement with those obtained in studies on data from Mexico (95% CI (1.2, 1.6)) [18], the United States of America (95% CI (1.7, 1.8)) [19], and New Zealand (95% CI (1.80, 2.15)) [20].

All those indicate that the model selection depends on the length of the time series. Moreover, Logistic model is a special case of Richards model with the exponent of deviation parameter 1.
