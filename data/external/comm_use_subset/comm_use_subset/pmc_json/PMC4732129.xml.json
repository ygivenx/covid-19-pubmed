The principle interaction underlying therapeutic effects of such medicines is the antigen-antibody (Ag-Abs) interaction, the identification and quantification of which is therefore an important target for immunoassays [3,4]. To date, a variety of corresponding assays have been available, differing in the method of detecting this interaction: (1) direct detection where the Ag-Abs complex is identified either visually or by simple optical devices [5,6]; (2) detection based on the passive agglutination reaction, i.e., adhesion of particles with Ag or Abs bound to their surfaces [7,8]; (3) detection relying on the use of various labels [9,10,11,12,13,14]; (4) detection techniques employing rapid, portable, high-sensitivity sensors. The latter include immunochromatographic systems [15,16], immunochips [17], or immunosensors [14,18], which represent a fast-developing approach in laboratory analysis using various types of biologically sensitive elements to furnish information about the Ag-Abs interaction in the form of electrical signals [19]. The important distinction of immunosensor assays is the method of signal transduction which may employ either an electrochemical or an optical transducer [20]. In electrochemical transducers, an electrochemical signal is measured, the magnitude of which changes following the formation of the Ag-Abs complex [21,22]. In the case of optical transducers, Ag-Abs quantification is based on the generation of light signals (color change or fluorescence) or changes in the optical properties of the environment [23]. Among major advantages of immunosensors are the rapidity of analysis, convenience of use, possibility of quantification with subsequent mathematical processing, portability of the test devices and high sensitivity [19].",

PI enables direct detection of biochemical interactions between receptor molecules without the need for additional labeling (fluorescent, enzymatic, etc.) which favorably distinguishes them from similar devices. This type of immunosensor is characterized by fast response and ease of operation, integrability into multisensory systems or automatic data acquisition systems [25]. The unparalleled feature of PI is that they compromise high sensitivity ensured by the use of QCR as a transducer element and selectivity, which is determined by the specificity of receptor molecules employed [19]. The principle behind PI operation is the detection of frequency variations of the electrical signal following Ag-Abs complex formation, resulting in an increase of mass sensed by the quartz plate of the resonator or cantilever. The specific biolayer in a QCR provides highly selective identification of homologous antigens in a complex mixture with no need for additional procedures involving other reagents.",

Dilutions prepared using this technique were found to share a common feature\u2014the ability to directly modify the initial substance, alter its spatial structure and, consequently, its physicochemical and biological properties. RAF-based drug products are referred to as \u201creleased-active\u201d, with their efficacy and safety proven by both non-clinical and clinical studies [28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39]. We also previously demonstrated the possibility of using ELISA tests for examining the effects of both antibody and non-antibody RAFs on the Ag-Abs interaction [40,41]. Development studies of RAF Abs to IFNg using ELISA showed that the binding constant of commercial Abs to IFNg was changed in the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg, indicating that RAF Abs to IFNg can influence steric interaction [40]. Because the characteristics of PI are largely dependent on the concentration and steric availability of biomolecules immobilized onto the electrode surface, we suggested that this approach could be used for identification tests and assays of RAF Abs. For this purpose, we selected a PI technique employing high-sensitivity sensors in order to evaluate the effects of RAF Abs to IFNg on the Ag-Abs interaction. This provided us with the data elucidating the influence of RAF Abs on Abs\u2019 affinity to IFNg; the findings are presented in this paper.",

Analysis of liquids with the use of piezoelectric sensors can be carried out both in a static and a flowing mode.

The test samples were analyzed in the flowing mode. Using sensor as a detector for flow-injection analysis makes it possible to raise the speed of determination and also provides the opportunity of observing immunochemical reactions in real time. The analysis employed dosage unit samples, power unit, 15\u201320 \u00b5L flow cell providing contact with the analyzed sample only from one end of the sensor, peristaltic pump (KNAUER, Berlin, Germany), drive circuit (TTL based on IC74LS320) transforming mass changes of the bioreceptor coating into frequency fluctuations, frequency-measuring device DiScope (NPP \u201cBafika\u201d, Moscow, Russia) and personal computer.",

RAF Abs to IFNg were obtained using routine methods described in the European Pharmacopoeia [44]. Briefly, antibodies to IFNg (2.5 mg/mL) were mixed with a solvent (ethanol-water solution) and shaken for 1 min to produce C1 dilution (first centesimal dilution). All subsequent dilutions comprised one part of the previous dilution and 99 parts of solvent (ethanol-water solution for intermediate dilutions and distilled water for the preparation of final dilution), with succession between the dilution steps. Thus, RAF of Abs to IFNg contain released-active dilutions of antibodies, which were diluted up to receiving the mixture of final dilutions C12, C30 and C50. The solutions were prepared in sterile conditions protected from direct intense light and stored at room temperature. All dilutions were prepared in glass vials. For lactose sample preparation, lactose monohydrate powder was saturated with RAF Abs to IFNg on a 96 L Pilotlab fluid bed apparatus (H\u00fcttlin GmbH, Schopfheim, Germany). In case of tablet form, each tablet was made from such lactose powders saturated with RAF Abs to IFNg and auxiliary components by compression molding.",

Since the analytical signal was shown to diminish in the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg, more reliable results of Abs to human IFNg detection were expected with regard to indirect measurements by comparing the analytical signal of the sensor obtained with IFNg solutions containing or not containing the RAF of specific Abs. Considering the available ELISA [40], we suggested that the effects of RAF Abs to IFNg could be evaluated using pre-incubation with one of the components of the Ag-Abs system for compounds containing RAF Abs to IFNg. However, variations of the analytical signal measured with PI may occur not only as a result of specific IFNg-Abs interactions, but also due to dilution or ionic strength changes of the analyzed solution, or non-specific interactions of secondary components with IFNg and the receptor layer. Hence, the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg in a sample can be demonstrated with higher reliability when differential evaluation of the signal is undertaken, with account for the noise signal, by examining the difference between the signal obtained in the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg and that of the placebo. The evaluation described was carried out, showing that the analytical signal was decreased following pre-incubation of Abs to IFNg with RAF Abs to IFNg which indicated attenuated affinity between IFNg and specific Abs in the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg. For instance, the decrease of the analytical signal was greater for RAF Abs to IFNg as compared with the placebo: the differences in signal magnitude were 19.4% (p \u2264 0.0001) for tablets, 51% (p \u2264 0.0001) for liquid samples and 34.3% for lactose powders (Figure 1).",

The appropriate method for determination of RAF of Abs activity should be based on their mechanism of action and be sensitive enough to detect small changes in interaction of the molecules. As we stated before, the RAF of Abs exert the direct effect on conformational parameters of the biological target molecules which is a probable trigger mechanism resulting in sensitization of the biological targets and modification of the parameters of ligand-receptor or antigen-antibody interactions [27]. The PI approach seemed to be very convenient for solving this kind of task. Our results confirmed this suggestion and showed that PI devices are applicable for the detection of RAF Abs to IFNg samples (formulated as solutions, lactose powders or tablets) by examining their effects on the interaction between IFNg and specific Abs.",
