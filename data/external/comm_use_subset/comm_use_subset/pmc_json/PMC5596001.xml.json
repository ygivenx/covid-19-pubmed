Although an animal reservoir has been proposed as the ultimate source of infection3, evidence of interhuman transmissibility in community clusters3\u20136, among hospital contacts7, 8, and among health care workers8 have raised concern about the pandemic risk of this emerging infectious disease9. These fears were underlined by an outbreak of MERS that took place in South Korea in May 2015 where the index case was a 68-year-old male with a travel history to four countries in the Middle East10, 11. By the time this outbreak was declared over on 28th July in 2015, it had claimed the lives of 36 of the 186 confirmed cases11.",

The majority of patients in other countries had travelled to KSA and UAE prior to the onset MERS. Descriptive results on demographic characteristics, comorbidity, and contact patterns are provided in Table 1. Fatal cases in patients with MERS were older (P < 0.001) and predominated in males (P < 0.001). Among the 1223 cases where comorbid conditions were reported, patients with comorbidity were at elevated risk for being dead compared with those without (11.1% vs 48.3%, P < 0.001). Note that cases with unknown comorbid conditions were similar to those without. When the history of contact patterns were categorized into camel contact, other animals, and presumed human, there was no statistical difference in outcome across these contact patterns (P = 0.476). The fatality rate was higher in the period before Mar. 20, 2014, when compared to after (P = 0.004).

The non-significant variation of fatality rate across countries we found here after taking into account the characteristic of MERS patients suggests that any variation in disease monitoring, contact tracing, case identification and thus timing of medical intervention across countries has had minimal clinical impact on average. However, the increasing survival rate we noted in the later epidemic period in our study could indicate that the quality and/or timing of medical treatment has generally improved as the epidemic has progressed. The potential causes of this require further study, but could be due to increased awareness, especially enhanced reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases. Conversely, it seems unlikely that this change is associated with a single mutation in the virus because several different MERS CoV phylogenetic clades have circulated in this period15. We also note that the case fatality rate of Zaire Ebola virus has similarly decreased with time27.",

Neverthelss, the work here differs in four respects. First, we have used a Weibull proportional hazards rather than Poisson regression, which has allowed us to investigate the incremental change in daily death rate over time. Second, we have not chosen to exclude the outbreak in South Korea as they did on the grounds that it was \u201cunique.\u201d Rather we have tried to explicitly model its potentially unique nature by allowing for variation in fatality rates across countries, finding no evidence that the characteristics of the South Korean outbreak being different from that seen anywhere else. Third, we have more than a year\u2019s extra data to analyse. Finally, these factors have combined to lead to our conclusion that those with a later time of infection onset had lower risk in our multivariate analysis, but this only showed in the univariate analysis of Rivers\u2019s study.",

This is because although our analysis including age, sex, and comorbidity as the major factors associated with fatal outcome, other relevant factors such as biochemical values, type of comorbidities and treatments were not included because such information is not typically publically reported. However, the failure to detect an improvement in the fit of our models by DIC when we applied random intercept and random slope to the impact of comorbidities across countries (Supplementary material G) suggests a homogenous definition for comorbid conditions among countries.
