            "text": "Pheromones play a crucial role in mediating socio-sexual interactions between conspecific members in rodents [1, 2]. In mice, pheromone components comprise both volatile organic compounds and non-volatile proteins, such as exocrine gland-secreted peptide 1 (ESP1) secreted by tear glands [3] and darcin (MUP20), a member of the major urinary proteins (MUPs) [4]. MUPs are low-molecular-weight (approximately 19 kDa) members of the large lipocalin family and are produced by the liver, filtered by the kidneys and secreted into the urine in some rodent species, such as mice and rats [5]. In rats, MUPs are also referred to as alpha-2u globulin (i.e. \u03b12U-globulins) [6]. MUPs are highly polymorphic and encoded by at least 21 MUP genes on chromosome 4 in mice and approximately 9 genes and 13 pseudogenes on chromosome 5 in rats [7, 8]. MUPs are usually more prevalent in males than in females in rodents, implying a male-biased trait [9]. Rodents use voided urine to extensively mark their territories for chemosensory communication [10]. The MUPs in the deposited urine bind to and slow the release of volatile compounds, which is critical for the longevity of scent marks [11\u201313]. However, MUPs themselves function as chemosignals to convey socio-sexual information for conspecific receivers and thus regulate socio-sexual interactions. These two roles of MUPs are both related to urine-mediated chemical communication [1].",

            "text": "In rodents, pheromones acting as sexually selected traits are associated with sex, reproductive readiness and the quality of the signallers [1]. Sex pheromones are released by animals to elicit a sexual interaction with a member of the other sex of the same species and particularly mediate female mate choice for male mates in rodents [14, 15]. The identification of male pheromones has been a major focus of studies of sexual selection for many years. Currently, a few organic volatile compounds have been chemically characterized from mouse and rat urine and preputial glands and identified to be male pheromone components [12, 14, 16, 17]. Several MUPs have been characterized from male urine in mice, and some of them have been demonstrated to promote male-male territorial aggression, female attraction, conditioned place preference, or play a role in signaling individual identity [4, 18\u201320]. In rats, about 13 MUPs have been found in urine, including OBP3 (PGCL4), MUP13 (PGCL1), and PGCL2 [21\u201325]. Since the genes of the MUP family share high sequence homology, the purification of MUPs from urine and expression of a single specific protein in vitro is difficult [26], and the role in intraspecific communication of each MUP isoform in male urine, is rarely experimentally verified in rats [25, 27].",

Male pheromone components partially or completely restore the sexual attractiveness of castrated male urine to female rodents [14, 16, 17, 28]. Male pheromones are primarily received by females via the vomeronasal organ (VNO), which then sends neuronal signals to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). The AOB directly targets higher centres in the brain, including the medial amygdala (MeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), to process the sensory information [3]. The hypothalamus acts as a major source of neuroendocrine hormones that influence reproductive behaviour, and the activation of the hypothalamus by male pheromones arouses female sexual behaviour [2]. In the VNO, vomeronasal type 1 receptors (V1Rs) are specifically expressed in the apical cell layer projecting to the anterior portion of the AOB (aAOB) and are responsible for receiving signals from volatile pheromones; vomeronasal type 2 receptors (V2Rs) are mostly expressed in the basal region projecting to the posterior portion of AOB (pAOB) and receive signals from non-volatile pheromones, such as ESP1 and MUPs [29\u201331].",

Researchers have not directly shown which single MUP isolated from rat MUPs may act as a male pheromone candidate, although a few MUPs that have been purified from urine are sexually dimorphic and positively correlated with quality, sexual attractiveness and copulatory opportunities in male rats [27, 32]. Among rat MUPs, MUP13 (also referred to as alpha-2u globulin PGCL1, UniProtKB accession number: P02761) has been isolated from rat urine and confirmed to be a kairomone, inducing fear reactions in mice [25]. OBP3 (odorant-binding protein 3, also referred to as alpha-2u globulin PGCL4, UniProtKB accession number: Q78E14), is named due to its nasal expression and odorant-binding characteristics, and has been demonstrated to be a member of the MUP family by sequence comparison [33]. Questions were raised about whether MUP13 and OBP3 function as male pheromones for conspecific communication in rats.",

Sexual dimorphism was also observed for total MUPs and darcin in mice [4, 39]. However, total MUP levels were more than ten-fold higher in males than in females in the present study, consistent with previous findings that the dichotomy is much more pronounced in rats than in mice [40, 41]. Serum testosterone exerts a stimulatory effect on MUPs, indicating that male-biased MUPs might be regulated by male hormones [36, 38]. Therefore, rat MUPs have the necessary features of chemicals used as male pheromones in rodents [15, 28].",

We generated rMUP13 and rOBP3 according to previous studies [25, 33], and studied their biological functions.

            "text": "The combination of gel-based separation and mass measurements is often used to identify information regarding protein sequences, where proteoform-specific unique peptides analysed by high-resolution mass spectrometry are required to discriminate homologous protein superfamilies at the amino acid level [43]. IEF resolves proteins that differ in their pI values by as little as 0.01. Some studies have efficiently separated MUPs and characterized MUPs related to kinship and individual recognition in mice using IEF [10, 34]. Nineteen spots separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) were identified as Alpha-2 U-globulin (MUP) using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry in outbred Wistar rats [21], and a unique male-specific MUP resolved by narrowed-range IEF was also characterized by MS/ MS in mouse urine [44]. Inbred Lewis rats may express fewer MUP isoforms than outbred Wistar rats, and thus, IEF is more manageable for separating MUPs from Lewis rats [45]. Although more than one MUP is contained in a single band/spot on a 2-DE gel [21], a greater number of specific unique peptides with high sequence coverage are contributed by the most abundant proteins [46] and are used for MS-based quantification to successfully identify proteins [26, 47]. In our study, the considerable sequence coverage of the matching peptides (82.32%, 78.45% and 75.98% for MUP13, Alpha-2u globulin PGCL2 and OBP3, respectively) was sufficient to demonstrate that these three bands in IEF were the predominant MUPs.",

Volatile male mouse pheromones, such as farnesenes, hexadecanol acetate and hexadecanol, and non-volatile male mouse pheromones, including ESP1 and darcin, and volatile male rat pheromones, such as 4-heptanone, 2-heptanone and 9-hydroxy-2-nonanone, were previously identified using this methodology [3, 4, 14, 17, 28, 48]. In the current study, female rats exhibited consistent chemosensory preferences for MUP-enriched urine from males compared with that from castrated males; female rats also exhibited a preference for urine from androgen-treated castrated males compared with that from castrated males. In particular, the urine from castrated males supplemented with rMUP13 or rOBP3 showed the same attractiveness to females as urine from intact males, suggesting that both MUP13 and OBP3 in male urine aroused female attraction and were male pheromones. Besides Lewis, we have also found in Sprague-Dawley and wild-captured rats that the MUP13 and OBP3 exhibited male-biased sexual dimorphism and were associated with sexual attractiveness to female rats (unpublished data), suggesting MUP13 and OBP3 identified in Lewis male rats might be common male pheromones across strains or populations of rats.",

Male protein pheromone signals are received by the VNO and transferred to central structures that regulate the behavioural or neuroendocrine responses of female rodents [1, 3, 49, 50]. It has been found in Wistar rats that mixed MUPs induced attraction and activated neurons in the posterodorsal medial amygdala of females [27]. Here, MUP13 and OBP3 activated the characteristic neural pathways (i.e., pAOB, MeA, BST and VMH) of female rats in response to male protein pheromones, providing neural evidence for the identity of male pheromones. In particular, the activation of the hypothalamus suggested that MUP13/OBP3 stimuli may be male pheromone eliciting female sexual attraction.",

Likewise, ESP1, a male pheromone in tears, not only induces sexually receptive behaviours in females but also enhances male-male aggression in mice [3, 51]. The multiple effects of pheromones on behaviour may be attributed to MeA. The MeA, receives inputs from the AOB and MOB (main olfactory bulb) and is an important centre that integrates all kinds of information and governs social behaviour. Accurate pheromone-behaviour responses, such as sex and aggression, are analysed by MeA and then controlled by the VMH [52].",

            "text": "The genes of MUP family are expressed in a complex sex- and tissue- specific manner [5, 37, 53, 54]. They are highly expressed in male liver and the submaxillary, lachrymal, preputial glands in both sexes and also expressed in female mammary glands [53, 54]. In rats, the mRNA of mup13 is expressed in liver, preputial gland, and spleen, and the mRNA of obp3 was found in liver, salivary gland, submaxillary gland and nasal cavity [5]. MUPs enter urine via hepatic biosynthesis [37]. The hepatic expression of rat MUPs is under regulation of multiple hormone, and the hepatic expression is sex-dependent and under developmental control [32, 38, 55\u201357]. In the present study, the hepatic mRNA levels of both mup13 and obp3 are decreased by castration, consistent with previous findings that castration decreases the synthesis of MUPs, and the hormonal control of MUPs synthesis is associated with hepatic mRNA level [36, 38]. However, obp3, but not mup13, was significantly higher in T-treated group than in sham-operated control group, suggesting that the expressions of obp3 was slightly different from mup13 in response to testosterone. The mRNA of obp3, as well as the volatile pheromones which we reported in previous work, was overexpressed in T-treated group [14]. The total testosterone levels in serum were measured, and no significant difference was found between sham-operated control and T-treated group (1.03 \u00b1 0.18 ng/ml vs. 0.85 \u00b1 0.07 ng/ml, mean \u00b1 standard error, n = 7 for each group). It remains to be determined whether the free testosterone and other testis-related hormones are excess and related to the overexpression of obp3 and volatiles.",

The eluted peptides were electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer, and raw MS data were acquired in the data-dependent acquisition mode. The Proteome Discoverer software system (version 1.4.0.288; Thermo Scientific, USA) was used to analyse the raw data and score peptides for identification. A search of the MS/MS data against the Rattus norvegicus database (SwissProt, 2012) was performed using the built-in Sequest-HT search engine. The mass deviation of the precursor ion, the fragment ion tolerance and the false discovery rate were set to 10 ppm, 0.05 Da and 0.01, respectively. The minimal peptide length was 6 amino acids, and two missed trypsin cleavage sites were allowed. The acrylamide modification of cysteines and methionine oxidation were set as fixed and dynamic modifications, respectively. When the search results were filtered, the matching proteins with a high peptide confidence for at least one unique peptide were considered significant [64\u201368].

We dissolved rMUP13 and rOBP3 in 1\u00d7 PBS at concentrations equal to the levels detected in urine from intact males to prepare scent stimuli. We painted a glass slide with 20 \u03bcL of either rMUP13 or rOBP3 for the experimental group or 1\u00d7 PBS for the control group (PBS-treated control group). The slide was fixed on the wire bar lid of the cage. The protein product (Fos) of the immediate early gene c-fos was used as a marker of neuronal activation and the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir) cell indicated the activation levels [71]. Since the c-FOS protein synthesis follows mRNA accumulation and could be detected by immunohistochemistry at 20 to 90 min post stimulation [3, 72, 73], the subject was allowed to freely investigate the sample for 90 min.",

The brain and olfactory bulb were removed, postfixed with 4% PFA overnight, dehydrated with 30% sucrose in PBS until they fell to the bottom of the container, respectively sliced into 40 \u03bcm coronal sections and 20 \u03bcm sagittal sections using the freezing microtome (Leica, Germany), and stored in 0.1 M PBS.

Free-floating brain sections were selected at 80 \u03bcm intervals and serial sections of the olfactory bulb were chosen for c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Briefly, sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS-T (2% goat serum in 0.01 M PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100) for 1 h and incubated with a primary antibody (1:2000 dilution) against c-Fos (ab190289, Abcam, UK) for two nights at 4 \u00b0C.
