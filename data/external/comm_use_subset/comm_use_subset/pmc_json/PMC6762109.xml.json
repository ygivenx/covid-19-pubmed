In swine, colostrum ingestion is essential for postnatal piglet survival, growth, and development because it provides immunity, nutrients, energy, and bioactive factors [1, 2]. The window of opportunity for milk-borne bioactive factors to influence neonate development is limited, and primarily occurs prior to closure of tight junctions between cells lining the piglet\u2019s gut. Closure of the gut occurs by 48 h postnatal [3]. During the first 48 h postnatal, piglets ingest up to 30% of their body weight in milk [4]. This time-period is a critical developmental period for the gilt reproductive system, including the formation of uterine glands, otherwise known as adenogenesis [5, 6]. Colostrum ingestion significantly affected the developmental trajectory of uterine tissue [7\u201310]. Replacement gilts with less colostrum consumption than littermates as indicated by blood immunocrit values had reduced litter sizes relative to other sows [11, 12]. Colostrum-deprivation also resulted in significantly different patterns of uterine gene and protein expression [13].",

However, in order to evaluate uterine development, the animal must be euthanized. We previously proposed that since the vagina is embryologically related to the uterus [14], its postnatal developmental trajectory may also be responsive to early nutritional environment. Moreover, we proposed that using vaginal swabs to non-invasively sample the lower reproductive tract may serve as a means to evaluate differences in nutritional exposures on gilt development. Using a biomarker-discovery technique known as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) profiling, we found that lipid profiles, or lipidome profiles, of vaginal swabs taken on postnatal day 14 differed between gilts that were fed milk replacer during the first 48 h postpartum before return to litter versus gilts that suckled sow\u2019s milk continuously from birth [15].",

Secondly, we tested the effect of a lard-based supplement on vaginal lipid profiles of gilts [17\u201320].",

Between sample injections, methanol/chloroform was injected to remove any remaining lipids before the next sample injection. Samples were examined for fragmentation features of specified chemical classes using Precursor (Prec) and neutral loss (NL) scan modes as previously reported [15]. Scans were used to profile chemical classes, which included: phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), acylcarnitines (AC), cholesteryl esters (CE), glycosylinositolphosphoceramides (GIPC), phosphatidic acids (PA), phosphatidylcholines (PC), alkenyl-acyl PCs (ePC), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylglycerols (PG), phosphatidylserines (PS), fatty acids (FA), ceramides, sugar lipids, and glycerolipids (see S1 Table for classes scanned). Initial data processing of the profiles obtained was carried out by converting each set of MRM\u2010profiling method data into mzML format using MSConvert20. Next, the signal intensity for the ions present in NL and Prec mass spectra was obtained using an in\u2010house script.

During the screening phase, TAGs were profiled using parent ions and a product ion related to the presence of specific fatty acyl residues (16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4). MRMs identified in the discovery step and TAG MRMs were divided into 8 groups, or 8 screening methods. The methods were organized by factors such as lipid class to optimize the efficiency of the machine and to limit the number of precursor ion/product ion pairs screened per sample injection. Thus, for each of the 8 methods, intensities of approximately 250 MRMs were measured per 8\u03bcl sample injection. Since cellular content in each sample may vary when using swabs, prior to screening, lipid extract amount was recorded across samples by scanning for the precursor ion of m/z 184, which profiles the most abundant lipids in cells, namely PC and SM lipids. In this way, intensities for PC lipids were measured, and samples were diluted using the same flow injection solvent to achieve a similar concentration for comparative relative analysis.",

For this reason, 18 mass units (NH4) was subtracted from the parent mass observed in the MS analysis to obtain the neutral mass for each TAG.

            "text": "The high correlation of MRM intensities between nutrition source and swab were primarily driven by lipids that were significantly more abundant in milk replacer than colostrum samples. These findings demonstrate that lipid content in milk replacer formulas changes the composition of neonate tissues, and component fats may become part of the tissues. Lipids are bioactive molecules; they play a central role in metabolism and influence and modulate cell function. For example, lipids from the diet function in cytokine and (steroid) hormone synthesis, cell differentiation and growth, cell membrane structure, myelination, signal transmission, and are substrates used for prostaglandin synthesis. Fatty acids and their metabolites, such as eicosanoids, have a major signaling function and regulate gene transcription by serving as transcriptional co-activators, with polyunsaturated fatty acids activating the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptors [26, 27]. Thus, diet fatty acid composition has the potential to affect significant biological response in the neonate, which in turn can affect the course of neonatal development and health. In humans, there is evidence that the quality of dietary lipids provided to infants has a marked impact on health outcomes [28], and our study supports that dietary lipids become components of tissues. Although infant formula has been amended some, currently available products continue to be markedly different from breast milk in their lipid composition; these differences might be of importance for infant health, development and long-term fertility [28]. Correlation of lipids in nutrition source (milk replacer and colostrum) with serum and swab lipids suggest some lipids may be directly absorbed without modification in the gastrointestinal tract, potentially prior to intestinal barrier closure, which is within 36\u201348 h after birth [3, 29\u201331]. Thus, this period of time may be viewed as either a window of opportunity or vulnerability for influencing neonate\u2019s developmental program.",

Mean intensity of the cholesteryl ester was significantly higher in suckled plus fat supplemented gilts versus non-supplemented gilts. Unfortunately, MRM-profiling was not completed with the fat supplement. Thus, we can only speculate that the higher cholesteryl ester content in swabs was a response to the higher fat diet. Two glycerol lipids with EPA residues and the ceramide were numerically lower in vaginal swabs of fat supplemented gilts. EPA is either absorbed from the diet or synthesized from the essential fatty acids linoleic and alpha linoleic acid. A potential explanation of these findings is that direct supplementation of piglets with animal fats lowered the bioavailability of EPA (or linoleic and alpha linoleic acids). In the mature gut, triglycerides and phospholipids are hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase, but the ethyl ester of EPA requires additional digestion with bile salt\u2013dependent lipase [32]. Digestion and absorption of EPA is thus considerably lower than triglycerides and phospholipids, and dependent on high-fat content in meals, which stimulates bile-salt dependent lipase and enhanced absorption [32]. In porcine and human neonates the levels of pancreatic lipase and bile acids are much lower than at maturity [33]. Thus, despite the higher lipid content of fat supplement treated gilts, the low availability of bile acids levels may have limited EPA absorption. Further research into how lipids ingested by early postnatal gilts are metabolized and used in the reproductive tract is needed.",

Multiple lipid molecules were differentially abundant between gilts exposed to colostrum versus gilts fed milk replacer and gilts provided a fat supplement versus no fat supplementation during the first 48 h of life. Several lipids collected from vaginal swabs were highly correlated with the nutrition source a piglet ingested. Lipids more abundant in milk replacer appeared to be driving the association in the current study. These findings demonstrated that lipid composition of neonatal diet affects tissue composition and thus may affect development, function and overall health and fertility. Moreover, while data support the efficacy of using MRM-lipid profiling of vaginal swabs to detect differences in early postnatal nutritional exposures, findings also highlight a need to modify our approach to determine if biomarkers of colostrum intake can be specifically identified in vaginal swab samples.",
