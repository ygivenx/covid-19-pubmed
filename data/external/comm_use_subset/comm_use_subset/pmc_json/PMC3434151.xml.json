            "text": "The incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has increased over the past few decades. Up to now, nearly 34 million people suffered from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, and an estimated 2.7 million people were newly infected with the virus in 2010 (http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/hiv/facts/en/index3.html). However, the natural course of HIV-1 infection and the susceptibility to infection after exposure are highly heterogeneous among individuals [1], [2]. Despite of high-risk behavior and/or multiple exposures to HIV-1, some individuals remained seronegative, or uninfected. These individuals may have a different course of progression to AIDS and may have different clinical outcomes. It is a common observation that some infected individuals became symptomatic within 2\u20133 years while others remained asymptomatic for more than 10\u201315 years [3]. Last year, NIH published a conference report about definition of HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals. It is now a consensus to define HESN from several group of individuals who are at high risk of exposure which include : (1) the commercial sex workers, (2) people with hemophilia, (3) discordant couples, (4) intravenous drug users, and (5) mother-to-child transmission [4].",

Polymorphisms of certain chemokines and chemokine receptors have been reported to play important roles in individual variability in response to HIV-1/AIDS. The most investigated variation is the 32-bp deletion in the chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5 \u039432) gene, which was shown to confer resistance to HIV-1 infection in homozygous carriers, and its role has been investigated in a clinical context [8], [9]. Similar to CCR5, DC-SIGNR is potentially an important gene affecting host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin) is able to bind the HIV-1 gp120 surface glycoprotein with high affinity and is able to enhance trans-infection of T cells by HIV-1 [10]. DC-SIGNR is a homolog of DC-SIGN with 77% amino acid identity and preferential expression in liver and lymph node epithelial cells. DC-SIGNR functions similarly to DC-SIGN in capturing HIV-1 and enhancing HIV-1 infection of T cells [11].",

While the CRD forms complicated carbohydrates with high mannose-containing ligands, the neck-region is essential for lectin tetramerization and influences the capability of CRD to interact with pathogens such as HIV-1. Because the VNTR of the neck-region in DC-SIGNR is highly polymorphic, ranging from 3 to 9 repeats in worldwide populations, the polymorphism has been widely studied with regard to host genetic predisposition to HIV-1 infection [13]\u2013[23]. However, the results are controversial and inconclusive, most likely because of the different ethnic populations used in the different studies or lacking the statistical power in any individual study to produce a reliable conclusion. Thus, a comprehensive analysis is critical.",

In the primary analysis, an allelic association test was performed for the prevalent alleles, which were (1) the 7-repeat allele, (2) the 5-repeat allele, (3) the 6-repeat allele and (4) the 9-repeat allele. These alleles represented the four most prevalent alleles in human population. To correct for multiple testing for these 4 alleles, a Bonferroni correction was also applied to determine the corrected p-value (p-value corrected). After that it was found that 5-repeat allele had a protective effect. An exhaustive round of post-hoc analysis was carried out to identify if any particular genetic model was in operation. In this post-hoc analysis, the pooled ORs were performed between HIV-1 patients and control groups in the following genetic models: (1) the homozygote proportion [24], [25], (2) the 7/7 genotype vs. the other genotypes, (3) the 5/5 genotype vs. the other genotypes, (4) the 5/7 genotype vs. the other genotypes, (5) the 6/7 genotype vs. the other genotypes, (6) the 7/9 genotype vs. the other genotypes. As it is an explorative attempt to delineate the mode of operation account for the protective effect in the genetic test, no Bonferroni correction was carried out in this stage. In all the genetic models, the types of controls were used: (1) healthy normal or population controls and (2) HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) controls (see the Table S1 for detailed breakdown). Because the remaining rare genotypes and alleles of the VNTR locus have negligible frequencies in the cohorts, their comparisons were not conducted in this analysis. Stratified analyses were performed by ethnicity and sample size.",

For ethnicity, the studies were divided into two subgroups, one subgroup of Asian descendants (7 studies) and the other subgroup of European-American descendants (2 studies). The resistance to HIV-1 infection found among 5/5 homozygous subjects was predominantly due to the HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HESN) subjects of the Asian population (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.39\u20130.85, p = 0.006, Pheterogeneity = 0.34 and I2 = 12%) (Figure 4A).

The strength of the present analysis is based on the accumulation of published data that provides enough information to generate a more precise conclusion. By using different genetic models, we could preliminarily estimate the effect of the allele frequency, genotype frequency, and homozygous proportion. The results indicated that the 5/5 homozygous genotype was associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection. The protective effect was most predominant in HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals. The stratified analyses by ethnicity and sample size confirmed these findings. Thus, it is important to emphasize that in studies concerning HIV-1 susceptibility, taking samples from HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals as controls may be more powerful than taking random healthy individuals as controls. In future studies, collecting both HIV-1 exposed seronegative individuals (HESN) and random healthy individuals as controls would be helpful for clarifying the relationship between candidate genes and host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. But under the definition and criteria of HIV-1 exposed seronegative individuals (HESN), it is still a heterogeneous group. A workshop sponsored by NIH was conducted in 2011 and a consistent definition and criteria were drawn in the term of HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals [4]. In the following studies, the collection of the HESN as controls should strictly obey these definitions, which would be helpful in explaining natural HIV-1 protection in individuals exposed to HIV-1 who remain seronegative or demonstrate resistance to infection.",

[18] showed that patients carrying the 5-repeat DC-SIGNR allele had significantly lower HIV-RNA levels compared with those observed in patients with the 7- and 9-repeat DC-SIGNR alleles, though they did not observe that the different genotypes/alleles were associated with CD4+ T cell numbers. In vitro studies also demonstrated that DC-SIGNR with equal to or less than 5-repeat alleles displayed unstable homozygous or heterozygous DC-SIGNR aggregates [33] accompanied by changes in affinity for HIV-1gp120 glycoprotein [34]. Data from these in vivo/vitro functional studies gave some support to the hypothesis that the 5/5 homozygous genotype might confer more resistance to HIV-1 infection. However, these associations were far from conclusive. More functional in vivo studies are needed.",

First, we only included the studies written in English and Chinese, and the related reports in other languages were not included, which might bias our conclusion in this study. Second, publication bias could not be excluded though the test showed negative results. The studies reporting significant associations between certain genotypes and reduced susceptibility to HIV infection would be more readily published while the studies with nonsignificant associations would be more difficult to publish. Third, most of the studies were conducted using Asian population groups. In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, there was only one study performed with Africans and two studies with European Americans, each of which had a sample size too small to achieve enough statistical power to obtain significant observations. In fact, many association studies showed different results for different populations. Thus, further studies are warranted in other ethnic populations to evaluate the possible ethnic differences of the VNTR polymorphism and HIV-1 susceptibility. Fourth, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may influence host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. In fact, many genes have been proven to influence HIV-1 infection risk, but we did not have enough data to eliminate these interfering factors. Fifth, as most studies did not mentioned about potential population stratification of patients and controls samples, we cannot rule out a role of population structure in the observed association. Finally, further stratified analyses of patients and HESN individuals by infection exposure routes (sexual contact, intravenous drug use, etc.) could not be performed because the data detailing the infection route for the HIV-1 patients were lacking. Because DC-SIGNR is expressed at relatively lower levels in tissues in vivo\n[35], the association between the VNTR polymorphism and HIV-1 infection risk by different infection routes might be different.",
