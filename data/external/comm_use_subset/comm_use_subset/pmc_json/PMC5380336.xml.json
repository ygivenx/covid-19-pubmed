The virus has since spread across Asia, Africa and Europe, and has infected over 854 humans and caused over 450 deaths [1]. In 2013 a new subtype H7N9 emerged in humans in China and the human case count by December 2016 was over 795, with over 314 deaths [2]. Differences in the epidemiology of H7N9 and H5N1 have previously been described: human H5N1 cases report higher severity of disease [3] and higher levels of contact with sick or dead birds [4]; H7N9 is asymptomatic in birds [5] and found at lower prevalence rates in poultry [6]; and the spatial distribution of H5N1 within a comparable time frame is considerably greater than that of H7N9 [3]. This study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms behind H7N9 and H5N1, provide a geographic risk profile for each of the two virus subtypes across all of mainland China, and highlight the regions at greatest risk of experiencing AIV transmission.",

Currently, there is growing government support for implementing fundamental changes in traditional poultry farming and marketing systems (such as centralised slaughtering of poultry, promotion of frozen poultry products, and increasing consumer awareness of disease risks) [7\u20139]. Implementing new province-wide regulation to poultry production and marketing systems is costly and logistically challenging. In contrast, implementing control measures in smaller, targeted areas allows for a more effective use of resources, easier management of adverse ramifications, and more specific assessments of interventions. A motivation for this study was to produce accurate risk assessment profiles at a spatially disaggregate scale, in order to identify the set of regions which should be targeted for control.",

SDMs are models which quantify the relationship between species distribution data (a set of locations representing sites where a species has been found), and a set of environmental covariates. SDMs can aid our understanding of virus spatial distributions, help to identify risk factors of disease occurrence, and reveal specific areas at highest risk of transmission which can be targeted for surveillance and control efforts. Examples of SDM algorithms include: Maxent, generalized linear models (GLMs), generalised additive models (GAMs), random forests or boosted regression trees (BRTs) [10]. SDMs are most commonly used in the fields of biogeography, conservation biology and ecology to identify environmental conditions which relate to species occurrence, estimate current species distribution and predict species distributions in new areas or under new environmental conditions [10,11]. In recent years, SDMs have been increasingly used in the public health context [12,13], particularly with respect to infectious diseases that involve vector species such as mosquito-borne diseases [14,15] and tick-borne diseases [16]; these diseases are markedly influenced by subtle changes in climatic conditions which determine vector distribution. In this study we created SDMs using Maxent for both H5N1 and H7N9.",

            "text": "A small set of previous studies have used SDMs to identify the set of high risk areas to target for control for both H5N1 [17\u201323] and H7N9 [24\u201330]. However, SDMs alone can only provide estimates of the probability of virus presence. In order to estimate the risk of disease transmission, a measure of interaction between animal and human hosts should additionally be considered. Thus, the risk assessment framework proposed in this study combined results from the generated SDMs with additional animal and human variables to capture such interaction. The risk methodology proposed in this work is similar to that described in Sarkar et al. [16] and Moffett et al. [15], which was developed for chagas disease and malaria, respectively. Similar to those works, we computed the relative risk of H5N1 or H7N9 human infection, defined as the risk in one cell compared to other cells in our study area. Within the context of AIVs, we found only four studies which have used a formal risk assessment method to build spatial risk maps. Spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods were used in Stevens et al. [31] to develop risk maps for H5N1 in Asia, however the study only used imprecise coordinate data to validate their model. Paul et al. [32] improved on this risk model by applying the same methodology with improved coordinate data to develop H5N1 risk maps for Thailand and Cambodia. Hill et al. [33] developed a risk assessment framework to assess the risk of species jump, rather than risk of human infection. Li et al. [30] built SDMs individually for H5N1 and H7N9 using BRT methods and overlaid these with areas which have high genetic re-assortment potential (areas with high density of important animal hosts such as poultry, swine and wild birds) to identify areas where novel AIVs are likely to arise. These models were of low resolution (county level), and did not take into account location data precision and accuracy [30]. To our knowledge, no previous studies have applied a risk assessment framework to individually identify areas of high H5N1 and H7N9 risk, which conceptually differentiates the probability of virus presence in the environment regardless of being in or outside a host (i.e. SDM outputs) and combines it with a measure of zoonotic transmission efficiency (i.e. animal and human population densities) at the high level of spatial disaggregation provided in this work.",

Most previous H7N9 SDMs used aggregated data and low resolution spatial units, e.g. county-level analyses [26,27,30]\u2013while few analysed data at high (e.g. approximately 1km2) resolutions [25,29].

Only Martin et al. [37] took accuracy of coordinate data into account. Furthermore, most H7N9 studies used only locations of positive human cases to define whether a location was infected [24\u201327,29,30]. Gilbert et al.

Maxent uses a machine learning algorithm to produce an estimate of the ecological suitability of a species using a set of environmental layers and a set of accurate case coordinates [43]. It does this by fitting a probability distribution to a set of cells in a study region\u2014it finds the probability distribution of maximum entropy (i.e. the most spread out distribution) subject to a set of environmental constraints that represent the species distribution [43]. For each cell in the study area, a relative environmental suitability for species presence is calculated (referred to as suitability values). Maxent consistently produces relatively accurate results, even when only small sample sizes are available (generally considered as n <100) [44\u201346]. A major advantage of Maxent is that it only requires presence data, making this method more advantageous over other genetic algorithms and regression methods. Instead of prediction of presence or absence, Maxent estimates the relative environmental suitability for presence of a species, which also allow for finer estimates. Additionally, most publically available epidemiological data consist of records of human infections and animal outbreaks ascertained from passive surveillance, whilst systematic active surveillance using formal random sampling methodologies are not routinely performed with regards to AIVs\u2014and details of negative cases or outbreaks (i.e. \u2018controls\u2019) are not made publically available.",

Observational studies and spatial-temporal analyses have shown AIV infections display seasonality patterns in humans and animals [47,48], solar cycles for example have been associated with pandemic influenza activity [49] and animal transmission studies of human influenza viruses have shown that changes in temperature and humidity affect transmission potential and virus binding [50]. Previous studies have also shown decreasing or increasing relative humidity influences virus stability (discussed in [50]). Ambient temperature can impact virus transmission due to physiological changes in the hosts which increase susceptibility to infections [51], for example, in wild bird species which carry LPAI AIVs transmission can increase dramatically during migratory seasons, as birds congregate in large numbers in water bodies, and their immunity levels are likely to be low due to the physical exertion required during migration. In addition, during breeding seasons the number of immunological na\u00efve birds increases substantially around this time, thus increasing the amounts of AIV shed in the population [52].",

The reasons for their inclusion were (i) they are widely available for most countries, and (ii) in some studies, they have been found to contribute significantly to AIV occurrence, possibly as a surrogate indicator for some unknown variable related to AIV risk [56]. Elevation is thought to relate to land coverage\u2014for example, areas of high elevation are dominated by forests, whilst flat areas (such as plains, deltas and coastal regions) are most likely be used for agriculture or urban development [56]. Slope and aspect may similarly influence AIV distribution through vegetation and land coverage. CTI is a measure for the tendency of water to pool, and may indicate areas suitable for rice cropping or duck farming which have been associated with H5N1 occurrence in Asia [57]. A discussion of CTI\u2019s influence on H5N1 transmission in Vietnam is provided in Saksena et al. [58].

Overfitting is more likely to occur when large numbers of environmental layers are used due to correlations between variables. A sign of overfitting is when a model performs very well (i.e. has high AUC results on the training data set), however performs poorly for unseen data (i.e. for the test data set). We adopt the same methodology as Sarkar et al. [16] to test whether models built with the full set of environmental variables (n = 23), were suffering from overfitting. First, the difference between test and training AUC scores was calculated for each set of 100 replicate models. Normality was tested using the Shapiro test and as not all data were normally distributed, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used to decide whether the distribution of AUC differences of models with using all variables (n = 23), compared to models with fewer variables (n = 11), were identical.

In order to estimate the likelihood of zoonotic transmission, a measure of transmission efficiency must be accounted for. As described in Hill et al. [33], for zoonotic transmission to take place, a susceptible human must be within range of an infected animal (or an animal environment contaminated by high viral shedding). The level of opportunity for human exposure from the virus is proportional to the product of the number of infected animals and the number of susceptible humans [65]. To estimate the risk of circulating viruses to cause human infection, the SDM outputs for H5N1 and H7N9 are combined with human and animal population density. We use domestic chickens as the representative animal host, as these animals make up the highest proportion of China\u2019s poultry sector [66], are the most commonly identified animal host of H5N1 and H7N9 [67], and virus shedding occurs at a higher rate in chickens compared to other avian species [5].",

For chicken density this is possibly because H5N1 is more likely to occur in chicken farms with poor hygiene and biosecurity practices, regardless of the size or density of the farm. There is extreme variation in terms of biosecurity, hygiene and farming practices among chicken farms in Asia\u2014and such variation is difficult to account for using the chicken density data sets that are currently available [55]. Stevens et al. [31] addressed this limitation by assuming a quadratic relationship between H5N1 risk and chicken density, with the highest risk areas being those with a medium density of chickens (between 500\u20135000 heads/km2). Their reasoning was based on a review of the literature [55], which found that most large commercial chicken farms (where chicken densities can be very high) often implement appropriate biosecurity regulations and are expected to have little risk of H5N1 occurrence. In contrast, medium-sized poultry farms (representing semi-commercial and backyard producers) are often the ones that are unregulated and have less stringent infection control. Subsistence farmers with very small flock densities are considered to have negligible risk due to insufficient hosts to sustain an outbreak. For human density the explanation is less obvious. One possibility is to do with the changing food consumption practices, which are more evident in urban areas\u2014a literature review of food consumption practices in China found that people are moving away from the traditional practice of purchasing fresh market produce and preparing meals at home, to now eating outside of the home (e.g. in restaurants) and eating processed foods [68]. Hence, we assume that transmission risk is lower in low human density areas and extremely high human density areas. There are however, no large scale surveys of consumer preference specifically for frozen or live poultry in China.",

For H5N1, most exact records were drawn from unknown location types (17 of 52) whereas for H7N9, most (54 of 69) exact H7N9 cases were obtained from LBMs where most H7N9 zoonotic transmission takes place.

Additionally, novel zoonotic AIVs (such as H10N8 and H5N6) have also emerged in mainland China, and human infections from these subtypes have so far been restricted to China. Furthermore, surveillance of poultry reveals there are many new reassortant AIVs being discovered [83,84]. Hence, zoonotic avian influenza poses a major risk to China.",

Quantifiable reductions of H7N9 human cases and AIV environmental samples have already been demonstrated following closure of LBMs in cities in Guangzhou (Guangdong); Shanghai; Hangzhou, Huzhou (Zhejiang); and Nanjing (Jiangsu) [85\u201390]. Peiris et al. [91] provide an extensive discussion of practical measures that can be made (temporary LBM rest days, removing live poultry from holdings overnight, separating aquatic poultry from gallinaceous poultry, centralised slaughtering of poultry), we recommend implementing these control measures in the high risk secondary administrative areas identified in our H5N1 and H7N9 risk models: Foshan, Zhongshan, Shantou, Dongguan, Zhanjiang (Guangdong); Beihai (Guangxi); Wuhan, Ezhou (Hubei); Nanchang (Jiangxi); Ma\u2019anshan, Wuhu, Tongling, Chaohu, Hefei (Anhui); Xiangtan (Hunan); Jiaxing, Zhoushan (Zhejiang); Changzhou, Nantong, Suzhou, Wuxi, Taizhou, Zenjiang, Yangzhou (Jiangsu); and Haikou (Hainan). The results from the risk models provide high resolution risk projections, which allow appreciable discrimination of higher risk areas within these regions (available for download: S3 and S4 Files) to further target implementation of control measures.",

A reliable risk model can reduce the need for expensive, large-scale surveillance programs to identify high risk areas. Our study finds differences in the geographic distribution and performance of H5N1 and H7N9 SDMs suggesting there may be intrinsic differences in how the novel H7N9 survives in the environment. We suggest future research focus on comparing H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence rates and survivability in the natural environment to develop a better understanding of environmental transmission in human infection.",
