            "text": "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs, prion diseases) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect a variety of mammalian species and include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, \u201cmad cow\u201d disease), chronic wasting disease (CWD) of deer and elk, sheep scrapie, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans [1]. The agricultural, economic, and social impacts of prion diseases have been intensified by evidence suggesting transmissibility of BSE to humans [2]. The putative infectious agent in these diseases, designated PrPSc, is a misfolded isoform of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC). The amino acid sequences of PrPSc and PrPC are identical [3]; normal and abnormal forms of the protein differ only in conformation. No differences in posttranslational covalent modification have been demonstrated [3]. Circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy indicate that the disease-specific isoform has a higher \u03b2-sheet and lower \u03b1-helix content than PrPC [4]. The normal isoform is soluble and primarily monomeric in solution, whereas PrPSc forms insoluble aggregates.",

Routes of natural transmission remain to be clarified, but available evidence indicates that an environmental reservoir of infectivity contributes to the maintenance of these diseases in affected populations [6\u20138]. The expanding range of CWD (several regions of North America and Korea) increasingly brings domestic livestock, companion animals, and wildlife species into contact with infected animals and carcasses, and shedded TSE agent, raising the possibility of cross-species transmission. This was demonstrated by the recent detection in Colorado, USA, of a free-ranging, CWD-infected moose, a species not previously known to be affected by the disease in the wild [9].",

TSE infectivity exhibits remarkable resistance to inactivation by most chemical agents, radiation, and heat [12] and has been shown to persist after burial in soil for at least 3 y [13]. Anecdotal observations of healthy sheep contracting scrapie after occupying fields previously containing diseased animals have been reported [7,8]. Although these older studies did not account for the genetic susceptibility of the sheep under study, they suggest that scrapie agent can persist in the environment for years. Recent controlled field experiments provide more compelling evidence of the environmental persistence of prions. Miller et al. [14] demonstrated that na\u00efve mule deer could contract CWD when housed in paddocks previously inhabited by infected animals or containing decomposed infected carcasses.",

Furthermore, bovine, sheep, and deer TSE agents have been introduced to soil environments through the burial of diseased carcasses and other infected material [18]. Animals ingest soil both deliberately and incidentally [19]. Cattle, deer, sheep, and other animals can consume hundreds of grams of soil daily [20,21]. Taken together, these data support the notion that PrPSc-contaminated soil may allow intraspecies TSE transmission and enhance the likelihood of spread to other species. As a first step toward understanding the role of soil as a reservoir of TSE infectivity, we investigated the binding of PrPSc to common soil minerals and whole soils and examined the infectivity of mineral-bound prions.",

Furthermore, this result suggests that fine quartz sand was saturated by at least 100-fold less PrPSc (\u2264 0.002 \u03bcg) than used for sorption experiments (Figure 1A).",

Of the minerals examined, Mte exhibited the highest PrPSc adsorption capacity (~100 \u03bcgprotein mgMte\n\u22121). The adsorption capacity of the quartz microparticles was nearly 10-fold less (~15.6 \u03bcgprotein mgmicroparticle\n\u22121), and that of Kte was nearly 100-fold less than Mte (~2 \u03bcgprotein mgKte\n\u22121). When expressed on a surface-area basis (Table 1), the adsorption capacities of Mte and quartz microparticles were indistinguishable by our measurement method; that of Kte was 25 times less.

We incubated PrPSc with Mte for short time periods (1\u201315 min) to qualitatively investigate initial adsorption and cleavage kinetics. Adsorption of PrPSc to Mte was apparent within 1 min, and reduction in protein molecular mass was discernable (Figure 2A). Prion protein cleavage consistently occurred early within the first 15 min of contact with Mte and appeared maximal by 60 min. Cleavage of PrPSc caused by sorption to or desorption from Mte seemed to be a phenomenon specific to this protein. We examined sorption and desorption of scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenate (BH) to Mte. Desorption of brain proteins from Mte produced no changes in the overall molecular mass distribution as visualized by Coomassie blue staining (unpublished data). Subunit C2 of the 20S proteasome (~29 kDa), an unrelated protein similar in size to PrP likewise did not appear cleaved upon desorption from Mte (Figure 2B). In contrast, PrPSc in BH was cleaved (Figure 2C).",

In contrast, probing identical samples with a polyclonal antibody against full-length PrP demonstrated that PrPSc was desorbed from the Mte. Although the precise cleavage site was not determined, these data suggest that the N terminus of PrPSc was removed; the fate of the cleaved amino acid residues is not known, as they may have remained bound to the clay or may have been extracted but not detected. When the N-terminal ~70 amino acids were removed from PrPSc by pretreatment with proteinase K (PK) prior to adsorption to Mte, we observed sorption to the Mte, but no further reduction in molecular mass upon desorption, evidence that other regions of the protein remain intact when associated with Mte (Figure 2E).

Washing Mte-PrPSc with the background solution used in sorption experiments did not induce detachment of detectable amounts of PrPSc from Mte (unpublished data). Contact of PrPSc with Mte for up to 1 wk did not result in additional degradation, indicating that the protein was not rendered more susceptible to cleavage by further structural rearrangements on the clay surface (Figure 3A). The strength of PrPSc attachment to Mte was surprising, even in light of reports of protein sorption-desorption hysteresis on mineral surfaces [26]. Conditions previously employed to desorb other proteins from soil minerals were largely ineffective in detaching PrPSc from Mte surfaces [26,27]. In our experiments, described above, a solution containing 10% SDS at 100 \u00b0C was used to remove the PrPSc from mineral surfaces. Changes in pH often alter interactions between clay surfaces and sorbed proteins [27,28]. Incubation of Mte-bound PrPSc in 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 2.5 or 11.5, proton activities substantially higher and lower than the reported isoelectric points for PrPSc [29], failed to release the protein (Figure 3B). Likewise, increases in ionic strength (0.1 M or 1 M NaCl) failed to remove detectable PrPSc from Mte (Figure 3C). Strong chaotropic agents can be effective in desorbing proteins from soil minerals by disrupting hydrogen bonds [26]; however, neither 8 M urea nor 8 M guanidine released detectable amounts of PrPSc from Mte (Figure 3D). Our data indicate the interaction between PrPSc and Mte is strong and of high affinity.",

If binding to Mte surfaces results in (partial) unfolding of PrPSc, a reduction or loss of infectivity would be expected, as denaturation renders the protein non-infectious [31]. We therefore tested whether PrPSc adsorbed to Mte remained infectious by intracerebrally inoculating hamsters with Mte-PrPSc complexes (Table 2). The time to onset of clinical symptoms after inoculation provides a measure of infectivity [32]. Hamsters inoculated with Mte-PrPSc exhibited clinical symptoms of scrapie 93 dpi. To control for any unbound prion protein that may have cosedimented with Mte particles, mineral-free PrPSc suspensions were processed in the same manner as in sorption experiments. The sedimented fraction of these control samples (mock pellets) showed substantially less infectivity than Mte-PrPSc pellets with a mean incubation period of 178 d, 105 d longer than Mte-PrPSc pellets. Hamsters inoculated with supernatants from these control samples (mock supernatants) showed clinical symptoms 103 dpi. Animals intracerebrally inoculated with Mte alone and uninoculated animals did not exhibit TSE symptoms during the course of the experiment (200 d).",

Prion protein desorbed from the soils did not appear cleaved. Several nonmutually exclusive factors may have contributed to this finding, including (1) relatively small amounts of Mte in some samples, (2) occlusion of Mte cleavage sites by metal oxide and/or natural organic matter coatings, and (3) competition among the various sorption domains (both inorganic and organic) for PrPSc, limiting interaction with Mte. The amount of immunoreactive PrPSc recovered from each soil differed slightly; for example, the immunoreactive protein desorbed from the Elliot soil was less than that from the Boardman soil. This may have been due to stronger interaction of PrPSc with the Elliot soil than with the Boardman soil, leading to incomplete extraction, consistent with the larger fraction of clay-sized particles in the Elliot soil (Table S2).",

In this study, we provide evidence indicating that soil and soil minerals serve as a reservoir of TSE infectivity. While extrapolation of in vitro studies to the environment must be made with caution, our findings suggest that PrPSc released from diseased animals may be sequestered near the soil surface, maintaining the TSE agent in an environmental medium with which livestock and wildlife come in contact. Our experiments demonstrate that Mte-bound PrPSc remains infectious and suggest that soil may harbor more TSE agent than previously assumed on the basis of water extraction of prions from garden soil [13].",

Although not relevant to TSE transmission, nonglycosylated, recombinant PrPC has been shown to bind to Mte [33]. Interestingly, the N terminus of PrPSc desorbed from Mte was truncated (Figures 1A and 2). While Mte is known to catalyze several reactions, including the deamination of free glutamine and aspartic acid [34] and the polymerization of RNA into oligomers [35], protease activity has not been noted previously. The interaction between Mte and PrPSc is remarkably avid, as the only extractant used in this study that effected desorption was a solution containing 10% SDS at 100 \u00b0C (Figure 3B\u20133D). Prion protein appears unlikely to readily desorb from Mte in the environment. The propensity for PrPSc to tenaciously bind to Mte could be exploited in landfills to isolate prion-infected materials and prevent migration of the infectious agent.",

Current mechanistic models for conversion of PrPC to the pathological form require direct PrPC\u2013PrPSc interaction [36]. The brain is unlikely to possess microenvironments capable of extracting significant amounts of PrPSc from clay surfaces. The 10-d increase in incubation period for Mte-adsorbed PrPSc relative to clay-free controls (mock supernatant) was statistically significant (p < 0.05) and would correspond to approximately a 1-log increase in infectivity [32]. This result suggests that PrPSc-Mte complexes are inherently more infectious than the unbound protein and/or adsorption to Mte reduces clearance from the brain. We consider it likely that PrPSc adsorbed to Mte surfaces was available to convert PrPC in the brain to the pathological isoform. Our findings are reminiscent of reports in which metal wires exposed to scrapie agent harbored significant infectious agent despite attempts to remove attached PrPSc [37,38].",

The binding of PrPSc to soil particles could reduce oral bioavailability such that soil serves as a sink rather than a reservoir for infectivity. Conversely, association with mineral particles may protect the agent from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, possibly enhancing transmission [39]. For example, bovine rotaviruses and coronaviruses retain infectivity via the oral route when bound to clay minerals [40].
