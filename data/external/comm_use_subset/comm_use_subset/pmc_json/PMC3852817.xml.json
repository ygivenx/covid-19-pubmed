BEN has late and subtle onset, between the 40s and 60s, with an extensive preclinical period, affecting both genders with slight female predominance. The disease shows familial clustering with affected individuals in several subsequent generations [3]. BEN has a slow progression leading often to terminal kidney failure. The disease has a striking correlation with uroepithelial tumours of the upper urinary tract - about 30-40% of the affected BEN individuals develop such a type of tumour [4,5]. The tumours show varying degrees of malignancy and are mostly papillar carcinomas [5]. They are one of the most common causes of death in BEN patients.",

Various chemical elements, organic and non-organic compounds, viruses and microorganisms are implicated in BEN development. Statistically significant differences in soil concentration of heavy metals such as Mg, Mo, Cd, Pb As, Se, Ca, Cu are observed between endemic and non-endemic regions [6], although there is no direct link of a toxic effect of any heavy metal to the disease development. Since BEN has similarities in pathomorphological characteristics with Chinese herbal nephropathy, a common etiology (toxic effect of the aristolochic acid) of both disorders was proposed. There is no irrefutable evidence supporting the effect of aristolochic acid on BEN development. Nevertheless there is a link between aristolochic acid and malignancies in BEN patients [7]. The mycotoxin ochratoxin A is supposed to have a synergic effect with other agents in BEN development [8]. Although there are different papers reporting on numerous viruses (Picorna virus, Polyoma virus, Herpes simplex 1 and 2, Adenovirus, Hepatitis B, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus) found in kidney samples of BEN patients [9,10], there is no substantial evidence supporting viral etiopathogenesis of BEN.",

A multifactorial model with polygenic genetic predisposition explains the disease characteristics [11,12]. Previous studies have implicated genes located in cytoband 3q25 - 3q26, genes coding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, tumour-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes. There is evidence that the share of rapid debrisoquine metabolizers is higher in BEN patients than in healthy controls [13], thus polymorphic variants in CYP2D6 causing sensitivity to various chemical agents are suspected in BEN pathogenesis. Partial LCAT deficiency was also studied in the context of BEN, since LCAT deficient individuals show evidence of renal tubular injury [14]. Cytogenetic research showed in vitro higher folic acid induced chromosomal fragility and more frequent spontaneous chromosomal aberrations [15,16]. Some of the regions expressing fragility contain oncogenes - 1p36 - C-SRC, 3p25 \u2013 RAF1, 3q27- FIM3, 6q23 \u2013 MYB, 1p13-NRAS, 6p11-KRAS1P.",

The epigenetic characteristics are maintained by specific mechanisms that firstly ensure the epigenetic profile through cell generations and secondly allow the cell to perform specific functions (differentiation) and to adapt according to different stimuli [17]. The major epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modifications, miRNA interference [18]. The dynamics of epigenetic processes allow the cells to respond reversibly and in a precise way to environmental stimuli, but also preserve cell type specific gene programmes. When alteration of epigenetic pattern occurs, diseases such as cancer could occur through pathological gene expression. Epigenetic changes over time display familial clustering [19]. This could explain the clustering of some common diseases in families and actually the epigenetic pattern could be implicated in transmitting a \u201cpredisposition\u201d over generations.",

The greater part of GpGs in the human genome is methylated. The CpG islands located in gene promoter regions and other gene related DNA sequences represent a significant exception [20]. CpG islands are defined as DNA sequences sizing at least 200 bp; the GC content is more than 50%, and with an observed-to-expected CpG ratio greater than 60% [21]. More than 50% of human genes contain a CpG island in their promoter region [20,22]. DNA methylation in promoter regions is mostly associated with gene silencing and lower gene expression levels. CpG island methylation is involved physiologically in genomic imprinting, X inactivation and cell differentiation. As well as a fundament for physiological regulation, DNA methylation processes can be involved in disease. An aberrant methylation profile is observed in different cancers [20,22].",

In the present study we aimed to investigate the methylation status across the whole-genome in different patient groups, based on gender and endemic region, in comparison to healthy controls from non-endemic regions. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were determined in different patient-control pairs and after compiling the DMRs data from all pairs the commonly presented DMRs were determined to be the most promising methylation alterations in BEN.

Making a smaller DMRs contribution are miRNA, signal transduction, mRNA processing and DNA replication. It appears that these processes may be deregulated in BEN.

HDAC11 is suggested to exist in a protein complex different from the known co-repressor complexes, that participate in other processes apart from strictly modulating chromatin composition [31]. Dysregulation of HDAC11 activity could be a cofactor in tumourogenesis. Inhibition of HDAC11 transcripts is proved to stimulate the production of tumour necrosis-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-17 in the supernatants of HL ( Hodgkin lymphoma) cells, suggesting invlovement of HDAC11 in immune response modulation. Furthermore, considering the high incidence of urothelial malignancies, we could speculate that HDAC11 deregulation can contribute to a disproportionate immune response and immunological tolerance to malignant cells in BEN patients.",

It codes a receptor for Il-17 family. The effect of IL-17 family cytokines is mediated by members of the IL-17 receptor family, IL-17 R/IL-17 RA, IL-17 B R/IL-17 RB, IL-17 RC, IL-17 RD, and IL-17 RE. Activation of these receptors triggers intracellular pathways that induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-17A, IL-17 F, and IL-17A/F are produced primarily by activated T cells and signal through an oligomerized receptor complex consisting of IL-17 RA and IL-17 RC. Ligand binding to this complex leads to recruitment of the intracellular adaptor proteins and activation of the transcription factors, NF kappa B, AP-1, and C/EBP. Overexpression of IL-17RA can lead to overstimulation of the immune response towards certain peptides by the magnified effect of IL-17A, IL-17E, IL-17C and could facilitate an abnormal inflammation response leading to nephritis. IL-17RA dysregualtion is implicated in major immune-mediated inflammatory disease such as Chron\u2019s disease [33] and psoriatic arthritis [34].",

Oligomers of the Sec61 complex form a transmembrane channel where proteins are translocated across and integrated into the ER membrane. SEC61G encodes the gamma-subunit of the complex. Little is known about the role of SEC61 complex in health and disease. According to MOPED data [36] SEC61 complex is expressed in T-lymphocytes and HEK-293 cell line. The fact that SEC61G is overexpressed in T-lymphocytes is also in line with our hypothesis of immunological involvement in BEN. SEC61G is strongly expressed in HEK293 cell line and bearing in mind that HEK-293 is an embryonic kidney cell line, this may imply that SEC61 is an important factor for early stage kidney cell growth and development. The exact function of this pathway in the adult kidney still remains to be investigated.",
