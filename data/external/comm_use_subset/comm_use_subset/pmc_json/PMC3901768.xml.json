Fundamental insights into the effectiveness of school closure can be gained from a parsimonious mathematical model, exploring possible answers to such key policy questions using simplistic modelling approaches. In the present study, our questions are two-folds. First, we examine when one should close the school during the course of a pandemic. Second, we explore how long the closure should be implemented. Parameterizing the model using published epidemiological estimates of the pandemic H1N1-2009 and accounting for the cost effectiveness of closure, we discuss if the timing and length of school closure could be optimized.",

For simplicity, we ignore small fractions of childless couples and unmarried adults among the total young adults. The cost of u1 is multiplied to the cumulative incidence of children during the closure, ignoring multiple infections in a household (i.e. we ignore brother(s) or sister(s) who are infected at the same time in a household). The population size to multiply u0 is calculated by subtracting the cumulative incidence from N2/2, because it is usually the case that either father or mother is absent from work during closure (and one of them continues to work).

Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the ICER remained to be above the acceptable threshold for all the assumed parameter space for H1N1-2009 (even when ICER took the minimum value). As for the length of closure, the ICER appeared to be a monotonically increasing function of the length of closure. For both the timing and length, the variations in the efficacy of closure and proportion of contacts compensated had only marginal impact on ICER.",

Nevertheless, again all the ICER values were above the acceptable threshold in Figure \n4A. When the infection fatality risk was proportionally magnified, we found that the ICER fall below acceptable threshold.

The model was parameterized with reference to empirical estimates of the pandemic H1N1-2009. School closure at the epidemic peak appeared to minimize the cumulative incidence, but the time of epidemic peak was shown to depend on R0. As the duration of school closure was extended, we observed a larger reduction in the cumulative incidence. Strikingly, the cost effectiveness analysis showed that our school closure scenario with parameters derived from the pandemic H1N1-2009 was not cost effective. Nevertheless, if the virulence is three times or greater than that of H1N1-2009, the cost of closure could be justified. These findings were not very sensitive to the efficacy of school closure and compensatory contact behaviour among children.",

            "text": "There are three important learning points from the present study. First, we have shown that there is no fixed timing and duration of school closure that can be recommended as universal for different types of influenza viruses. It is natural that the effectiveness of school closure depends on the underlying transmission dynamics, and the absence of simple universal guideline should be explained and communicated to non-experts. In fact, the dependence of the effectiveness of school closure on the transmission dynamics could explain variations in published opinions toward the epidemiological performance of the school closure as an option of mitigation strategy. Second, school closure during the pandemic H1N1-2009 appeared not to be cost effective even when the ICER took the minimum value. It implies that the cost-effective intervention against mild pandemic strain such as H1N1-2009 is different from that of virulent strains. This echoes the finding by Halder et al.\n[26,27] based on a simulation approach. Third, if a particular strain is virulent, school closure could be cost effective. Namely, given that the virulent strain widely spreads in the community, yielding high disease burden, school closure intervention, the cost of which is regarded as small for the high disease burden, should be implemented to reduce the disaster size as much as possible. In addition, since the equation (12) involves the wage of parents, it is important to remember that the cost-effectiveness may also depend on an economic standard of a country (e.g. school closure of pandemic H1N1-2009 may even be justified in a country with much smaller salary than that of Japan).",

The basic reproduction number is set at 1.4. Panels A and B vary the efficacy of school closure (i.e. the relative reduction in the child-to-child secondary transmissions) from 50% to 90%. No compensatory contact with adults is assumed in these panels. Panels C and D vary the proportion of child contact compensated with young adults, assuming that the compensation occurs for 0 to 50% of intervened within-child contacts. In these panels, the efficacy of school closure is set at 70%.",

            "text": "Figure 4: Sensitivity of the cost effectiveness of school closure to the severity of influenza pandemic. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as Japanese Yen per single life-year saved, is computed. Panel A examines ICER as a function of the reproduction number (ranging from 1.2 to 1.8) and the timing of school closure. Length of school closure in these panels is set at 7 days. It should be noted that the horizontal axis is at the ICER of 1.0 \u00d7 107 Yen/life-year. Panel B shows ICER as a function of the risk of death relative to assumed baseline of H1N1-2009 pandemic and the length of school closure. The relative risk of death of assumed pandemic is expressed as multiplier to the infection fatality risk of H1N1-2009 (e.g. if the relative risk is 50, the assumed pandemic is 50 times more likely lethal upon infection). The basic reproduction number and the timing of school closure in these panels are set at 1.4 and Day 60, respectively. Horizontal dashed grey line represents the threshold value of ICER, 1.0 \u00d7 107 Yen/life-year, below which one may regard the intervention as cost-effective.",
