Thousands of flavonoids have been documented from medicinal plants, especially from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) [2,3]. These flavonoids can be classified into two types: monoflavonoids (e.g., quercitrin [4]) and polyflavonoids (e.g., tetrahydroamentoflavone [5]). The so-called polyflavonoids, however, are predominantly biflavonoids, and biflavonoids can be found to co-exist with monoflavonoids in a same plant (especially CHMs) [6]. By comparison, triflavonoids and tetraflavonoids are very rare in natural products [2,7,8,9]. ",

Some 3\u2032,8\u2033-biflavonoids, however, comprise of two equivalent monoflavone residues; thus, they can be regarded as the dimerization product of the monoflavone. For example, isoginkgetin can be considered as the 3\u2032,8\u2033-dimerization product of acacetin. However, it is unclear whether there is a difference in antioxidant activity between the monoflavone and its 3\u2032,8\u2033-dimer, and how 3\u2032,8\u2033-dimerization affects the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids.",

As seen in Figure 1, acacetin is 5,7-dihydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyflavone. Isoginkgetin links two acacetin residues via the 3\u2032,8\u2033-sites; thus, it can be considered as the 3\u2032,8\u2033-dimer of acacetin. Thereby, it is believed that the comparison between isoginkgetin and acacetin will provide important evidence as to whether there is a difference in antioxidant potential between a monoflavone and its 3\u2032,8\u2033-dimer.

However, some of these 3\u2032,8\u2033-biflavonoids are constructed with two nonequivalent flavonoid monomers. For example, bilobetin is made up of an acacetin residue and an apigenin residue. Such a difference may bring about some uncertainties for the comparison. The other 3\u2032,8\u2033-biflavonoids (or their flavonoid monomers) are, however, unavailable. In fact, the flavonoid monomer of amentoflavone-4\u2032,4\u2034,7,7\u2033-tetramethyl ether (i.e., amentoflavone-4\u2032,7-dimethyl ether) has not yet been found.

Subsequently, isoginkgetin and acacetin were compared using the Cu2+ reducing antioxidant assay and the 2,2\u2032-azino bis(3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS+\u00b7) scavenging antioxidant assay. Both the Cu2+ reducing assay and the ABTS+\u00b7 scavenging assay involved electron-transfer (ET) mechanisms and hence may give experimental evidence for the effect of 3\u2032,8\u2033-dimerization on the ET potential of antioxidant flavonoids. Finally, acacetin was mixed with a stable oxygen-centered radical, the 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radical (4-methoxy-TEMPO), and then analyzed by using cutting-edge ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2212ESI\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS) to test the possibility of acacetin conversion into isoginkgetin.",

The improved pyrogallol assay demonstrated that the \u00b7O2\u2013 scavenging percentages of both the flavonoids were increased in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary 3 Figure S3.1); however, acacetin had a higher IC50 value than that of isoginkgetin (Table 1).

To fully explore their ET potential in radical scavenging, the two flavonoids were further measured by using the ABTS+\u00b7 scavenging assay. The ABTS+\u00b7 solution was prepared by an ET reaction (Section 3.4), where (NH4)2ABTS was oxidized by K2S2O8 to give ABTS+\u00b7, a radical with a \u03bb734 nm absorption peak and dark-green appearance (Supplementary 4 Figure S4.1) [20]. Thus, the ABTS+\u00b7 scavenging assay is considered as an ET-based radical scavenging reaction [5,21]. In the assay reaction, the (phenolic) antioxidant transfers one electron to ABTS+\u00b7, which diminishes the \u03bb734 nm absorption (Supplementary 4 Figure S4.1).",

Nevertheless, the ET potential of acacetin was weaker than that of isoginkgetin, according to the IC50 values listed in Table 1. Combined with the Cu2+ reducing assay results, it can be deduced that acacetin is indeed inferior to isoginkgetin in an antioxidant capacity through ET, and that 3\u2032,8\u2033-dimerization can improve the ET potential of antioxidant flavonoids.",

There is a dihedral angle of 45\u00b0 between the two acacetin planes. A similar dihedral angle can also be observed in other 3\u2032,8\u2033-biflavonoids, such as (+)-morelloflavone [13] and amentoflavonoid [22]. The dihedral angle of 45\u00b0 implies that the two acacetin residues are partially planar, and thus, partial \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 conjugation can occur through the 3\u2032,8\u2033-linkage. This partial \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 conjugation can slightly increase the ET potential, as seen in the Z-resveratrol molecule [23]. Thus, isoginkgetin possesses higher ET potential than acacetin. The ET antioxidant potential is known to be associated with the cytoprotective effect. Thus, our findings can be used to explain why 3\u2032,8\u2033-biflavone amentoflavonoid possesses better chemoprevention and neuroprotective effects than its mono-flavonoid apigenin [24,25,26].",

To verify whether acacetin can give a dimer, it was treated with 4-methoxy-TEMPO for 24 h in this study. The UHPLC\u2212ESI\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS determination revealed that acacetin yielded a small chromatographic peak at a retention time of 1.8269 min (Figure 2D). This chromatographic peak was associated with a MS peak with m/z 566, a value of twice the molecular weight of acacetin (Figure 2E), implying the generation of one dimer of acacetin. This dimer further produced several MS/MS peaks, including those at m/z 565, 550, 413, 389, 374, 345, 330, and 283 (Figure 2F). In accordance with these MS spectra, this dimer was elucidated as that shown in Figure 3A. It should be emphasized that other possible linkages between the two acacetin residues cannot be excluded, such as 7-O, 5\u2033-O, 6-C, 8-C, and 6\u2033-C. If a C\u2013O linkage is present, one of the phenolic -OH groups may be involved in the dimerization; thus, the dimeric product is presumed to be less active than the mono-flavonoid. Of course, the identification of the linkage will be the subject of further research in the future.",

In brief, a 0.05 mL methanol solution of acacetin (10.6 mM) was mixed with a 0.05 mL methanol solution of 4-methoxy-TEMPO (21.2 mM). The molar ratio of acacetin to 4-methoxy-TEMPO was 1:2. This reaction mixture was incubated for 10 h at room temperature and then diluted to 2 mL with methanol then filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter. The filtrate (2 mL) was analyzed by using a UHPLC\u2212ESI\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS system (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA).",
