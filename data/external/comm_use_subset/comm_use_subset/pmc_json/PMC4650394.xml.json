The identity of the molecules responsible for the antiviral activity are unknown and their identification could provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic drugs, including prophylactic drugs with suitable biopharmaceutical properties against PRRSV infection.

The first objective of the present study was to identify the mechanism behind the antiviral activity displayed by A. pleuropneumoniae. The second objective was to identify the molecules present in the A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant which are responsible for the antiviral activity against PRRSV. Therefore, we first used an antibody microarray to identify cell pathways modulated by the A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant, observed modulations in cell cycle regulation pathways and confirm these modulations by cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. We also demonstrated the ability of two known cell cycle inhibitors to inhibit PRRSV. Finally, mass spectrometry was used to detect and identify two molecules present only in the culture supernatant of A. pleuropneumoniae.",

Therefore, protein profiling of SJPL cells infected or not with PRRSV (MOI 0.5) and/or treated or not with the App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant was performed using Kinex KAM-850 antibody microarray. Eight hundred and fifty four cell signaling proteins were targeted, using 337 phosphosite-specific antibodies and 517 pan-specific antibodies. Pan-specific antibodies targeted both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins forms. Proteins were classified into nine groups according to their cellular functions: (1) transcription and translation factors; (2) proteins implicated in signal transduction pathway; (3) proteins implicated in host-pathogen interaction or in immune response; (4) proteins implicated in stress response; (5) proteins implicated in cell spreading, cell migration, cell survival, cell growth, cell cycle and cell proliferation; (6) apoptosis signaling pathway; (7) cytoskeleton-associated proteins; (8) proteins implicated in cell biosynthesis and metabolism; (9) proteins implicated in other biological process or unclassifiable proteins. Data are expressed in percent of change from control (mock-infected and untreated SJPL cells; % CFC) and are presented in Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1. The App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant upregulates inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKK\u03b2), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (Rip2) and caspase-9 (CASP9). In cells treated with App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant, cell cycle regulation proteins (M-phase inducer phosphatase 3 inactive form (CDC25c (ser216)) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2 active forms (CDK1/2 (tyr161))) and caspase-3 (CASP3) were modulated by the culture supernatant regardless of whether they were infected with PRRSV or not. Also, PRRSV seems to upregulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/mitogen activated protein kinase ERK pathway and NF-\u03baB pathway. Indeed, serine/threonine-protein kinase A-Raf (Raf-A), ERK1/2, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) were differentially modulated in presence or absence of culture supernatant. Thus, PRRSV upregulates MAPK/ERK and NF-\u03baB pathways. The culture supernatant seems to decrease the PRRSV induced upregulation for MAPK/ERK and NF-\u03baB pathways. Overall, the antibodies microarray data suggests that A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant modulates SJPL cell cycle.",

SJPL cells incubated in DMEM were used as normal cell cycle and we obtained a mean 50.6 % of SJPL cells in Gap-1 phase (G1-phase); 35.1 % of SJPL cells in DNA-synthesis phase (S-phase); and 14.3 % of SJPL cells in Gap-2 and mitotic phase (G2/M-phase) (Fig. 2a and b). We then used as controls, two molecules known to modulate the cell cycle at different phases. Nocodazole interferes with the polymerization of microtubules, blocking treated cells in G2/M-phase and inducing cell death by apoptosis [19]. Aphidicolin is a DNA-polymerase inhibitor and induces cell cycle arrest in S-phase [20]. When SJPL cells were treated with nocodazole or aphidicolin, we observed differences between treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2a). With nocodazole treatment, SJPL cell number in G2/M-phase increased (in mean) to 41.5% and an additional apoptotic peak before the G1-phase peak was seen as expected (Fig. 2a). With aphidicolin treatment, the proportion of SJPL cells in S-phase increased (in mean) to 51.9 % (Fig. 2a). Following validation with cell cycle controls, SJPL cells were treated with the App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant and significant variations in SJPL cell cycle proportions (n = 15; P \u2264 0.001) were observed. On average, proportion of SJPL cells in G1-phase stayed the same as untreated cells (45.0 %). However, the proportion of SJPL cells in S-phase and in G2/M-phase significantly (n = 15; P \u2264 0.001) decreased to 21.1 % and increased to 33.9 %, respectively (Fig. 2a and b), indicating that A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant had an effect on SJPL cell cycle.",

Thus, the \u2264 3 kDa App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant ultrafiltrate which possesses the antiviral activity against PRRSV also modulates SJPL cell cycle.

Two specific cell cycle inhibitors were used to verify whether cell cycle modulation induced by the culture supernatant is due to CDC25c and/or CDK1/2. We first used DIM which is a specific activator of cell cycle inhibitor serine/threonine-protein kinase (Chk2), Chk2 is an inhibitor of CDC25 and leads to a cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase [21]. Then, we used SBE-13 which is a selective inhibitor of cell cycle activator polo-kinase isoforms: PLK1, PLK2, PLK3 [22]. These proteins are implicated in the G2/M-phase transition pathway; PLK1 is a CDC25c activator and CDC25c promotes the G2/M-phase transition using cyclin-B/CDK1 complex. Both DIM and SBE-13 treatments induced a SJPL cell cycle modulation (Fig. 4). G1-phase of SJPL cells was not modulated by DIM or SBE-13 (Fig. 4a and b). The number of cells in S-phase was significantly (n \u2265 6; P \u2264 0.001) decreased (in mean) from 35.1 % to 17.7 % and to 3.6 % by DIM and SBE-13 treatments, respectively (Fig. 4a and c) and proportions of cells in G2/M-phase were significantly (n \u2265 6; P \u2264 0.001) increased (in mean) from 14.3 % to 37.0 % and to 51.8 % by DIM and SBE-13 treatments, respectively as previously observed with A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant (Fig. 4a and d).",

The G2/M-phase checkpoint is activated after DNA damages and provides opportunity to stop and repair the damaged cells. To the best of our knowledge, the observed cell cycle arrest induced by A. pleuropneumoniae has never been reported before. However, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (formerly Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) was able to stop growth and induce cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase of HeLa cells, by production of the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) [33, 34]. With regards to PRRSV, Sun and collaborators demonstrated the ability of its non structural protein 11 to control the cell cycle and to induce a cell cycle arrest in S-phase [35]. We demonstrated that A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant is able to induce a G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest in SJPL cells, resulting in decreased cell proliferation. Using CDC25c, CDK1/2 and PLK inhibitors, we confirmed the protein profiling results. DIM and SBE-13 are known to induce a cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase and both decreased proliferation of SJPL cells. The cell cycle arrest induced by A. pleuropneumoniae can be due to a CDC25c or CDK1/2 inhibition. We will further investigate this pathway using Western-blot analysis of regulation proteins.",

Protein concentration was determined on the supernatant using Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) and was adjusted to 2 mg/mL. Samples were then analyzed using Kinex KAM-850 antibody microarray (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Kinex KAM-850 antibody microarray includes 854 antibodies which target different cell signaling pathways and included 517 pan-specific antibodies and 337 phosphosite-specific antibodies. These include 466 antibodies against protein kinase, 44 antibodies against protein phosphatase, 46 antibodies against stress response proteins, 75 antibodies against protein implicated in transcription and 223 others.
