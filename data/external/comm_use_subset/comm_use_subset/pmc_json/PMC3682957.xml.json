The first instance of human HPAI H5N1 virus infection occurred in Hong Kong in 1997; it re-emerged in 2003 and has triggered sporadic human infections in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa with a mortality rate that could be as high as 60% [2] but the true mortality rate of H5N1 infected individuals is currently unknown [3]. Humans can be infected with H5N1 from close contact with infected poultry, and virus mutations have been identified in cases of cross-human transmission. Recent reports indicate that the involvement of HA and PB2 amino acid substitutions leads to easier transmission in ferrets, suggesting that HPAI H5N1 viruses have the potential to evolve and be transmitted between mammals, thus posing the risk of a human pandemic [4], [5]. Accordingly, an effective H5N1 vaccine is urgently needed to reduce pandemic potential.",

Anti-H5N1 neutralizing antibodies have been elicited in mice, chickens, and ferrets using recombinant HA proteins expressed in mammalian and insect cells [6]\u2013[8], plant cells [9], [10], and E. coli cells [11]\u2013[15]. Recombinant HA proteins from mammalian and insect cells are capable of more authentic post-translational modifications (e.g., disulfide bond formation and complex type glycosylation) that facilitate protein folding and stability [16]. Complex N-linked HA glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells have been described as eliciting stronger immune responses compared to pauci-mannose N-glycans expressed in insect cells [7], [8]. At least two research teams have reported that single GlcNAc glycans of complex N-linked HA glycoproteins increase receptor binding in sialic acid and neutralizing antibody titers in mice [7], [17].",

Results show that the recombinant HA proteins carrying pauci-mannose and high-mannose glycans elicited higher titers of HA-specific IgG antibodies and stronger T cell responses compared to recombinant HA proteins carrying complex-type glycans. Recombinant HA proteins carrying tri- and tetra-antennary complex-type glycans induced even higher neutralizing and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HI) antibody titers, thus enhancing protective immunity.

            "text": "The 3D protein structures of the pauci-mannose and complex-type N-glycans attached to the trimeric H5N1 influenza HA protein (A/Vietnam/1194/04) were created using the crystal structure of HA from A/Vietnam/1194/04 strain (PDB ID: 2IBX) and Glyprot [18]. These structures clearly elaborate the differences between insect cell expressed HA (\nFigure 1A\n) and mammalian cell expressed HA (\nFigure 1B\n). For insect cell expression, the soluble recombinant HA-expressing coding sequences were cloned into a pFast-Bac vector to obtain recombinant baculoviruses for infecting Sf9 and Mimic cells. For CHO cell (mammalian) expression, the HA coding sequence was optimized and cloned into a pISID expression vector containing intron splicing; IRES-driven dhfr gene amplification was performed as described in Lin et al. (2010) [19]. Recombinant HA proteins were obtained from the culture supernatants of Sf9, Mimic, and CHO cells and purified using nickel-chelated affinity chromatography. Results from the Coomassie blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels and anti-H5HA antibodies indicate that recombinant HA proteins from Sf9 cells (Sf9-rHA) had lower molecular weights than the HA proteins from Mimic cells (Mimic-rHA), and that the recombinant HA proteins from CHO cells (CHO-rHA) had the highest molecular weights (\nFigure 2A,B\n). Purified recombinant proteins of sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, and CHO-rHA obtained from nickel-chelated affinity chromatography were >90% as shown by Coomassie blue staining (\nFigure 2A\n). Although the purified HA protein was clearly the major component of the final preparations, host cell contaminants (i.e. DNA) and microbial or endotoxin contaminants were also present by the lab-scale purification equipment and procedures. However, the levels of DNA and endotoxin are relatively minor to affect immune responses in this study. We only detected low-level endotoxin in the purified recombinant HA proteins since cultured insect and mammalian cells were used for HA expression (data not shown).",

Figures 2A and 2B demonstrate the removal of terminal sialic acid with decreased molecular weights (CHO-rHA vs. CHO-rHA(+NA)). To further confirm that changing molecular weights reflected differences in glycan form, recombinant HA proteins were treated with Endo H and PNGase F. The high-to-low order of molecular weights following treatment with Endo H was CHO-rHA > CHO-rHA(+NA) > Mimic-rHA > Sf9-rHA (\nFigure 2C\n). Since Endo H only cleaves the mannose-terminated N-glycans, no molecular weight shifts were observed for CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) (\nFigure 2C\n vs. \nFigure 2A,B\n). In contrast, all four recombinant HA proteins had approximately equal molecular weights following treatment with PNGase F (\nFigure 2D\n). The results confirm that different N-linked glycans were added to the HA glycoproteins via insect or mammalian cell expression. Since similar molecular weights were observed in sf9-rHA and CHO-rHA after PNGase F treatment (\nFigure 2D\n), the alpha 1-3 fucose on the first GlcNAc, which was resistant to PNGase F, was not the major glycan structure in sf9-rHA. However, no alpha 1-3 fucose exists in CHO-rHA since CHO cells only introduce alpha 1,6-fucose to N-glycans [20].",

The Sf9-rHA primarily contained pauci-mannose (Man2-3GlcNAc2+/\u2212Fuc; 74.3%) and high-mannose glycans (Man4-9GlcNAc2+/\u2212Fuc; 17.1%), along with a much smaller amount of hybrid glycans (Man3GlcNAc3Fuc; 6.9%) (\nFigure 3A\n). The Mimic-rHA primarily contained bi-antennary complex glycans without terminal sialic acid (Gal1-2Man3GlcNAc4+/\u2212Fuc; 58%), along with high-mannose (Man7-9GlcNAc2+/\u2212Fuc; 29.2%), hybrid (Man3GlcNAc3+/\u2212Fuc; 6%), and minor pauci-mannose glycans (Man3GlcNAc2+/\u2212Fuc; 3.1%) (\nFigure 3B\n). Since Mimic cells were derived from Sf9 cells and integrated with mammalian glycosyltransferases [25], [26], Mimic-rHA mostly contained high-mannose or complex glycans with bi-antennary structures (\nFigure 3B\n). No sialylation was observed and tri-antennary structures were not extended on rHA from the Mimic cells. CHO-rHA mostly contained complex glycans with bi-, tri, and tetra-antennary structures containing one or more terminal sialic acids (Sia1-4Gal1-4Man3GlcNAc4-6+/\u2212Fuc; 94.9%) (\nFigure 3C\n). The CHO-rHA(+NA) glycan patterns consisted of complex N-glycans with bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary structures terminated at galactose ends due to sialic acid-associated NA cleavage. Mimic-rHA, CHO-rHA, and CHO-rHA(+NA) only contained partially mannose-terminated glycans, which could be cleaved by Endo-H, confirming that the molecular weight shift in SDS-PAGE was not clearly observed after Endo H treatment (\nFigure 2C\n).",

We only investigated the immune responses elicited by recombinant HA proteins coupled with PELC+CpG adjuvant.

Some clade 2.3.4 H5N1 viruses isolated from China and Vietnam, such as A/Anhui/1/2005, contain conserved glycosylation sites in HA, but other dominant viruses from clade 2.3.2, such as A/Hubei/1/2010, show the loss of glycosylation at 170N in HA, as well as most H5N1 viruses in clade 2.2 [32]. Thus, cross-clade neutralizing antibody titers were also determined against two heterologous clades: clade 2.3.4 for A/Anhui/1/2005 and clade 2.3.2 for A/Hubei/1/2010. Neutralizing IC50 titers from the CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) immunization groups were also significantly higher than those obtained from the Sf9-rHA and Mimic-rHA groups, in both cases against Anhui H5pp (\nFigure 7C\n) and Hubei H5pp (\nFigure 7D\n).",

According to our present results, recombinant HA glycoproteins containing complex terminally sialylated and asialyated-galactose type N-glycans induced higher levels of HI and neutralizing antibodies and better protective immunity in mice compared to recombinant HA glycoproteins containing pauci-mannose or high-mannose type N-glycans. While the antibody titers are higher with the insect cell derived HA proteins, the neutralization titers are much higher with the mammalian cell produced HA proteins with complex type N-linked glycans and the antibodies protect mice to lethal challenge.

CHO-rHA contains bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex type N-glycans with terminal sialic acid, whereas Sf9-rHA mainly consists of pauci-mannose and high-mannose type N-glycans. It was recently reported that recombinant HA proteins carrying terminal mannose residues induce lower HI antibody titers than HA proteins that carry complex glycans or single GlcNAc units [7], [17]. The findings of the present study are somewhat contradictory to the above in as much as recombinant HA proteins carrying low or high mannose glycans elicited higher titers of HA-specific antibodies and stronger T cell responses. Indeed, the higher the glycan content of tri- and tetra-antennary complex glycans, the greater was the neutralizing and HI titers and consequent protective effect. Therefore, the increased HI and neutralizing antibody titers associated with CHO-rHA are not due to suppressed DC activation by the terminal mannose moieties of HA glycoprotein, as has been reported for influenza HA [7] and HIV-1 gp120 [33]. Instead, we found that Sf9-rHA induced the highest levels of HA-specific total IgG and avidity in three of the four IgG subtypes (IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3), as well as higher levels of IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells and increased DC antigen presentation efficiency. Although the purified proteins of Sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, and CHO-rHA have identical amino acid sequences, the antigen presentation efficiencies of these antigens were significantly different (\nFigure 6C, D\n and Figure S1). As it was known that intracellular antigen uptake, routing, and presentation are associated with distinct endocytic receptors such as C-type lectins [34]\n, [35], the increased antigen presentation efficiency by Sf9-rHA may be through mannose-terminated N-glycans interacted with lectin receptors guiding to early endosomal compartment but still required further investigation.",

Greater sialic acid binding has been reported following the trimming and modification of the oligosaccharides of N-glycans such as single GlcNAc [17], pauci-mannose, and high-mannose [7], [36]. Removal of the terminal sialic acids of complex type N-glycans increased sialic acid binding [8], [17], [36]. Results from fetuin binding assays with Sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) indicate a high-to-low binding activity order of Sf9-rHA > Mimic-rHA > CHO-rHA(+NA) > CHO-rHA (Figure S2). Since fetuin contains both \u03b12-3- and \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids, we used a 98-glycan array to analyze these recombinant HA proteins; our results indicate binding between Sf9-rHA and 18 of 26 \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids, but not between Sf9-rHA and any of the 13 \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids (Figure S3). Mimic-rHA reduced binding to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids by approximately 50%; no binding was observed for \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids. Relatively low bindings were found for CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids, as compared to strong binding to Sf9-rHA. The binding intensity of CHO-rHA to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids decreased by almost 25 folds as compared to Sf9-rHA; however, CHO-rHA(+NA) further increased the binding to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids by approximate 3 folds. In contrast, immunization with CHO-rHA elicited higher levels of HI and neutralizing antibodies, and better protective immunity against challenges with live viruses. These results conflict with a recent description of single GlcNAc HA N-glycans increasing the receptor binding of sialic acids, as well as correlations between this increase and increases in both neutralizing antibody titers and protective immunity in mice [17]. Accordingly, recombinant HA protein antigenicity and immunogenicity may not be directly associated with the receptor binding activity of \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids.",

The enhanced protective immunity provided by the removal of sialic acid by neuraminidase can be also due to CHO-rHA protein degradation induced by 37\u00b0C/6hr treatment which requires further confirmation. We also found that the terminal sialic acids of complex-type HA glycoproteins did not significantly affect neutralizing antibody titers against homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus clades (\nFigure 7\n), but did induce higher levels of IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells and increase DC-associated antigen presentation efficiency (\nFigure 6\n). It was reported that recombinant HA proteins from Sf9 and HEK293 cells to show that anti-H5N1 neutralizing antibody responses are not dependent on terminally sialyated N-glycans [8]. Increased DC binding has been reported following the removal of HIV-1 gp120 terminal sialic acid [37], therefore improved protective immunity from galactose-terminated complex N-glycans may also be due to increased interaction with DCs. In a separate study, HA N-glycans of the PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza A virus produced in MDCK and Vero cells were all asialyated, with the former containing larger, tri- or tetra-antennary, alpha- and beta-galactose-terminated N-glycans, and the latter containing smaller, exclusively beta-galactose-terminated N-glycans [38]. MDCK cell-derived viruses with the N-glycan pattern have been found to favor antibody responses, while Vero cell-derived influenza viruses with the N-glycan pattern have been described as increasing differential T cell responses mediated by DCs [39]. In the present study, immunization with Mimic-rHA (primarily containing galactose-terminated, bi-antennary, and high-mannose type complex N-glycans) yielded lower levels of protective immunity and decreases in body weight loss (\nFigure 8\n). This suggests that tri- or tetra-antennary complex-type N-glycans are required for inducing protective immunity against H5N1 virus infection. This strongly suggests that recombinant HA glycoproteins with tri- or tetra-antennary complex type N-glycans (obtainable from engineered CHO cells) have potential for use in subunit vaccine development. Since ferrets are regarded as the most appropriate animal model for H5N1 pathogenesis and therapeutic and prophylactic development [3], [40], [41], the differences and similarities in the mouse, ferret, and human immune response and the projected testing of these recombinant HA vaccines require further investigation.",
