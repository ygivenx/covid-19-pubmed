Although cases have been largely concentrated on the Arabian Peninsula, a large travel-associated outbreak in South Korea in 2015 highlights that MERS-CoV remains a global concern. MERS-CoV circulates in dromedary camels in Africa and the Middle East, having established a reservoir in camels, while closely related viruses are found in African bats, suggesting a bat origin for MERS-CoV or its direct ancestors (3\u20138).",

Several studies utilizing ectopically expressed protein and reporter systems have identified NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 as putative interferon (IFN) antagonists, but these studies may not faithfully recapitulate the complex interactions between viral and host factors present during infection (11, 13, 15\u201317). More recent studies utilizing recombinant MERS-CoV have more completely elucidated the functions of some of these proteins, but conflicted with early reporter studies. NS4a, a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein, prevents the generation of protein kinase R (PKR)-induced stress granules in some cell types (18). We reported previously that NS4b is a homolog of the NS2 protein of MHV and closely related betacoronaviruses of the subgenus Embecovirus (formerly lineage A), has 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, and acts as an antagonist of the oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway (19). In contrast to the Embecovirus PDEs, NS4b has an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) and is localized primarily to the nucleus of infected cells (16, 19). NS4b has also been reported to antagonize NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation during MERS-CoV (12, 14, 18, 19), as has NS5 (10).",

Consistent with earlier studies, NS4a prevents phosphorylation of PKR and the induction of IFN and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. However, PKR activation in the absence of NS4a does not result in phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1) or translation arrest in A549 cells, in contrast to recent findings in a different cell type (18). Unlike other viral dsRNA binding proteins such as vaccinia virus E3L (21) and influenza virus NS1 (22), NS4a does not play a significant role in OAS-RNase L antagonism during MERS-CoV infection, as deletion of NS4a does not result in RNase L activation or enhance RNase L activation in the context of MERS-CoV encoding catalytically inactive NS4b.",

This is a unique role for virus-encoded phosphodiesterases, which otherwise lack an NLS and act solely as OAS-RNase L antagonists (12, 23\u201326).

Deletion mutants MERS-\u0394NS4a and MERS-\u0394NS4ab were generated from the MERS-CoV infectious clone derived from the MERS-EMC2012 strain (27) as follows and are described in detail in Materials and Methods and diagrammed in Fig. 1A and B. Briefly, MERS-\u0394NS4a was generated by altering the start codon (ATG\u2192ATT) and adding an in-frame stop codon 10 codons downstream (TGG\u2192TGA) to ablate synthesis of the NS4a protein. MERS-\u0394NS4ab was generated by engineering a 951-nucleotide deletion of open reading frame 4a (ORF4a) and the majority of ORF4b without disrupting the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of NS5. To verify the loss of NS4b and/or NS4a expression by these mutants, human A549 cells stably expressing the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (A549DPP4) were infected with MERS-CoV mutants at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, and protein lysates were harvested at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi) to assess protein expression by Western blotting. As expected, NS4a is not synthesized during infection with MERS-\u0394NS4a, and neither protein is detectable during MERS-\u0394NS4ab infection (Fig. 1C).",

MERS-NS4bH182R encodes NS4b with a catalytically inactive phosphodiesterase domain, which was generated from the MERS-CoV infectious clone as previously described (19, 27). The NS4b NLS was previously described as bipartite (RKR11KRR), with the first basic motif more potently determining nuclear localization (12, 16). However, this first motif overlaps with the upstream ORF4a, and so mutation of the RKR motif without causing amino acid changes in ORF4a is impossible. To determine how to construct the NS4b NLS mutant (NS4bNLSmut), we mapped the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence by expressing wild-type (WT) and various NLS mutant NS4b genes from a pCAGGS vector in A549 cells and detecting NS4b proteins by immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 2A). These plasmids expressed NS4b proteins with mutations of the RKR motif, the downstream KRR motif, and a previously undescribed basic motif that lies between the two previously characterized motifs (RKR5KKLR2KRR). All mutant proteins exhibited primarily cytoplasmic localization; thus, we engineered mutation of the central (KKLR) and downstream (KRR) motifs into the MERS-CoV infectious clone to generate MERS-NS4bNLSmut (Fig. 1B), as described in detail in Materials and Methods (27).",

We infected A549DPP4 cells with MERS-CoV and used immunofluorescent microscopy to determine NS4a localization. NS4a exhibits a primarily punctate, perinuclear distribution with some diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). Cells were costained for NS4a with J2 antibody to detect dsRNA and antiserum against the viral primase, nsp8, a component of the viral polymerase complex and therefore a marker for virus replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) (28). NS4a colocalizes with dsRNA, and both are largely colocalized with nsp8, though dsRNA and NS4a appear more broadly distributed (Fig. 3). This may indicate that either some dsRNA and NS4a localized outside the RTC or the sensitivity of the assay is insufficient to detect all of the nsp8.",

Vero cells lack a type I IFN response and were used to ensure recombinant viruses are not inherently replication deficient. We infected both cell types with WT or mutant MERS-CoV at an MOI of 1 and harvested supernatant at predetermined times postinfection for titration by plaque assay. All viruses replicated with equivalent kinetics to WT MERS-CoV and to equal titers in Vero cells, indicating that deletion of NS4a and NS4b does not disrupt critical aspects of the viral life cycle (Fig. 4A). In contrast, deletion of NS4a and/or NS4b modestly attenuated MERS-CoV replication in A549DPP4 cells at an MOI of 1, with the reductions in titer significant at most time points (Fig. 4B and C). Deletion of both NS4a and NS4b resulted in a slightly greater attenuation than deletion of NS4a alone, though this difference was not statistically significant. That replication of these mutant viruses is attenuated in A549DPP4 cells and not in permissive Vero cells strongly suggests that the deficiency is linked to the intact antiviral responses in A549 cells.",

Interestingly there was no significant induction of type I IFN (Fig. 5C). We did not observe any significant additive effect on antiviral gene expression from the additional deletion of NS4b. However, deletion of ORF4a and/or -b (Fig. 5C) did not result in IFN induction approaching the levels we observed in response to SeV and SINV infection (Fig. 5B), suggesting MERS-CoV encodes additional, potent IFN antagonists and/or utilizes other mechanisms such as sequestration of dsRNA in membrane-bound RTCs to avoid sensing by antiviral receptors.",

Unlike previously studied viral PDEs such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NS2, the torovirus pp1a C-terminal domain, and the rotavirus VP3 C-terminal domain, which exhibit primarily cytoplasmic localization (23, 24), NS4b localizes primarily to the nucleus (Fig. 2B), suggesting additional functions. Earlier studies suggested that NS4b nuclear localization might be important for suppressing IFN expression (15), but no previous studies have specifically addressed the role of its catalytic activity in IFN antagonism (30). To characterize the function of the NS4b PDE domain and NLS, we used recombinant MERS-NS4bH182R and MERS-NS4bNLSmut. In Vero cells, both mutant viruses replicated with equivalent kinetics to WT MERS-CoV and to equal titers (Fig. 6A). In A549DPP4 cells, both viruses are modestly and similarly attenuated at late time points at an MOI of 1, and throughout the course of infection at an MOI of 0.1 where two out of three independent experiments yielded significant differences (Fig. 6B and C). qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that mutation of either the catalytic site or NLS results in significantly increased IFN and ISG expression during MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 6D).",

Since RNase L activation by MERS-NS4bH182R is less robust than by other viruses such as SINV in A549DPP4 cells (Fig. 7), we hypothesized that NS4a may contribute to antagonism of this pathway during MERS-CoV infection. To test this hypothesis, we infected A549DPP4 cells at an MOI of 5, harvested RNA 48 h postinfection, and assessed rRNA degradation using a Bioanalyzer (19, 23). We included SINV as a control for robust RNase L activation (32). RNase L activation is inferred from RNA degradation depicted by the banding pattern in the pseudogel image. MERS-NS4bH182R and MERS-\u0394NS4ab induced more rRNA degradation than WT MERS-CoV, indicating activation of RNase L (Fig. 8). Infection with MERS-NS4bNLSmut also did not result in increased rRNA degradation, as expected given previous work demonstrating cytoplasmic PDE localization mediates RNase L antagonism (34). However, infection with MERS-\u0394NS4a also did not induce increased rRNA degradation relative to WT MERS-CoV, indicating that the absence of NS4a alone is not enough to activate RNase L in this cell type (Fig. 8). Infection with MERS-\u0394NS4ab did not induce more robust rRNA degradation than MERS-NS4bH182R, suggesting that NS4a does not play a significant role in antagonism of RNase L during MERS-CoV infection. This result demonstrates that NS4a has both functional similarities to and differences from other viral dsRNA binding proteins.",

A549DPP4 cells were infected with WT MERS-CoV and MERS-\u0394NS4a at an MOI of 3, lysed at 24 h postinfection and analyzed for PKR activation by Western blotting.

However, despite the activation of PKR, we did not detect phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 above background levels, suggesting that activation of PKR by MERS-\u0394NS4a in A549DPP4 cells is not sufficient to engage downstream elements of this pathway or that MERS-CoV encodes an additional antagonist that blocks steps downstream of PKR phosphorylation. In contrast, SINV infection promotes robust phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2\u03b1 in the same cells, indicating the lack of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation during MERS-\u0394NS4a is not due to a deficiency of this pathway in A549DPP4 cells (Fig. 9A).",

This is likely due largely to viral antagonists of dsRNA-induced host responses. Our study, as well as recent reports from other labs, has shown that deletion of MERS-CoV accessory proteins from recombinant viruses leads to enhanced activation of antiviral pathways. However, these effects are relatively small compared to those in other RNA viruses, and deletion of these accessory proteins only mildly attenuates replication. This is in contrast to early studies utilizing overexpression and reporter plasmids or ectopic expression from heterologous virus showing robust suppression of IFNB induction by NS4a and NS4b (11, 13\u201316).

These modest differences are consistent with previous studies of MERS-CoV accessory proteins (10, 12, 14, 18, 30). Furthermore, there is a clinical report of human isolates with a 16-amino-acid deletion in NS4a (37) and West African camel MERS-CoV isolates with ORF3 and ORF4b deletions, likely due to founder effects upon introduction into these populations (30). The isolation of these viruses supports findings that MERS-CoV accessory proteins are not definitive determinants of viral replication.

It is not known whether this reduced expression is due to reduced protein stability or to the antibody not recognizing the mutant protein as efficiently as the WT protein. However, the abundance of NS4b during infection with MERS-NS4bNLSmut, though lower than that of WT protein, is sufficient to fully prevent RNase L activation, indicating mutation does not reduce NS4b levels below an effective concentration (23, 34, 41) (Fig. 7). Thus, it is unlikely that decreased mutant protein abundance is responsible for the observed IFN phenotype (24). We observed a faster-migrating protein, also staining with antiserum directed against NS4b (Fig. 1C). We presume that this faster-migrating protein was not detected in NS4b mutant-infected cells due to its lower expression level relative to full-length NS4b and because it is weakly expressed even in WT MERS-CoV NS4b cells. We do not know the identity of this band. However, we speculate it could be a breakdown product of full-length NS4b or more interestingly a protein initiated at one of several ATGs located downstream and in frame with the NS4b initiation site.",

Based on the role of the viral dsRNA binding proteins NS1 of influenza virus and E3L of vaccinia virus (21, 22, 33) in blocking RNase L activation as well as IFN and PKR, we hypothesized that NS4a contributes to antagonism of OAS-RNase L. Surprisingly, infection with MERS-\u0394NS4a did not induce increased rRNA degradation compared to wild-type virus, nor did NS4a deletion produce any additive effect on RNase L activation in combination with deletion of NS4b. Nevertheless, the lack of robust RNase L activation even when NS4b is catalytically inactive suggests the possibility MERS-CoV does encode additional antagonists. One intriguing possibility is nsp15; its MHV ortholog has recently been described as contributing to evasion of multiple dsRNA-sensing pathways (42, 43). Alternatively, as has been speculated for MHV, MERS-CoV dsRNA may be contained, even in the absence of NS4a, in viral replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) and therefore hidden from antiviral sensors (44, 45).",

One previous study showed that ectopically expressed NS4a inhibits PKR activation and can functionally replace the native PKR antagonist of encephalomyocarditis virus (14). Deletion of NS4a within recombinant MERS-CoV has previously been shown to result in enhanced translation arrest compared to WT MERS-CoV in HeLa cells (18). Consistent with this, we found that deletion of NS4a results in PKR phosphorylation, but in A549DPP4 cells, this did not lead to phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 above background levels, and MERS-\u0394NS4a did not induce more translation arrest than WT MERS-CoV. In 293TDPP4 cells, MERS-CoV induced translation arrest as previously reported (36), but we did not observe a more robust effect during MERS-\u0394NS4a infection. Furthermore, PKR was not phosphorylated in 293TDPP4 cells during MERS-\u0394NS4a infection, confirming the PKR-independent mechanism of translational arrest and highlighting differences between cell types in antiviral pathway activation. These differences demonstrate the importance of using multiple model systems to fully elucidate interactions between viral proteins and host immune pathways.",

Human A549 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. A549DPP4 and 293TDPP4 cells were constructed by lentivirus transduction of DPP4. The plasmid encoding the cDNA of DPP4 was purchased from Sino Biological. The cDNA was amplified using forward primer 5\u2032-GACTCTAGAATGAAGACACCGTGGAAGGTTCTTC-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-TCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATAGGCTTACCAGGTAAAGAGAAACATTGTTTTATG-3\u2032. A V5 tag was introduced to the 3\u2032 end of the cDNA by PCR to enable easy detection of DPP4. The amplicon was cloned into pCR4-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen K457502), to make pCR4-DDP4-V5. The fragment containing DPP4-V5 was digested by the XbaI and SalI restriction enzymes from pCR4-DPP4-V5 and was cloned into pLenti-GFP in place of green fluorescent protein (GFP), generating pLenti-DPP4-V5. The resulting plasmids were packaged in lentiviruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) to establish the gene knock-in cells as previously described (32). Forty-eight hours after transduction, cells were subjected to hygromycin (1 mg/ml) selection for 3 days and single-cell cloned. Clones were screened for DPP4 expression and susceptibility to MERS-CoV replication. RNase L knockout A549DPP4 cells were generated as previously described for parental A549 cells (32). A549mCEACAM-1 cells were generated as described above for A549DPP4 cells, but by insertion of mouse Ceacam-1 (GenBank accession no.
