            "text": "Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was developed in early 1990s for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids1, which is widely used in almost all fields of biomedical research, agriculture, food and environment sciences2\u20135. Although some new methods such as isothermal amplification methods, loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)6, 7, rolling circle amplification (RCA)8, 9, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)10 and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK)11 had been developed in recent years, qPCR is still considered to be the most robust technology in clinical diagnostic assays, especially for infectious diseases12\u201314. RT-qPCR is usually accomplished by using either double-stranded DNA-binding dyes (e.g. SYBR green I15 and SYTO916, 17 or fluorescence-based probes18. The dsDNA-binding dyes are cheaper than reagents used in the probe-based methods; however, their non-specific binding to dsDNA may result in false positive results, and inaccurate quantification19, and thus limits their use in qPCR for qualification of gene expression and molecular diagnosis. There are three main types of fluorescence-based probes in qPCR, including hydrolysis probes (often called as TaqMan probes)20, hybridization probes21, 22, and molecular beacons23. Some other types of probes, such as scorpion primers24, light upon extension (LUX) primers25 and Amplifluor primers26 were also developed for qPCR. Among these new probe types, the TaqMan probes were the most widely used for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids, and often developed into commercial kits for clinical diagnosis. Molecular beacons were more often used in the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)27, 28.",

            "text": "The detection and quantification of pathogens requires high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility29. For qPCR, high sensitivity and specificity depend on the well-designed primers and probe that all bind to the highly conserved genomic regions of target pathogens. If the primers or probe bind to non-conserved genomic (e.i. highly variable) regions, amplification efficiency will be greatly reduced, which is a major reason for low detection sensitivity and specificity for some viruses29, 30. Currently, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are a serious threat to global public health. More than 70% of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are caused by viruses, and vast majority of human viruses (especially RNA viruses) have higher mutation rates than bacteria, fungi and other pathogens (e.g. mycoplasma and chlamydia). Because of high genetic variability, some viruses (e.g. HIV-1, HCV) are divided into genotypes or subtypes30\u201332. Therefore, it is more difficult to find highly conserved regions shared by all genotypes or subtypes of the same virus. It is harder to design and select appropriate qPCR primers and probes for virus detection with high detection sensitivity and specificity than for bacteria, fungi and other pathogens29. Furthermore, the qPCR requires a pair of primers and a TaqMan probe, and the probe length usually requires more than 25 nt to ensure relatively high Tm value (68\u201370 \u00b0C)2, 18, which further increase the difficulty of primer and probe design. Although MGB (minor groove binder) modification had been demonstrated to increase the stability of duplexes formed by probe and target, and allows shorter probes33, it is still a big challenge for the development of qPCR methods for high-efficient detection and quantification of all genotypes/subtypes of highly heterogenetic viruses such as HIV-1 and HCV.",

Various chemical modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, amination, and dideoxy nucleotide) at 3\u2032-end base or the 3\u2032-OH of the primer do not influence the removing (proof-reading) activity of the HF DNA polymerase34. A fluorescent probe (e.g. TaqMan probe) often contains a fluorophore and quencher group at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of an oligonucleotide, respectively. The fluorophore- or quencher-modified base can be removed from the probe by HF DNA polymerase when the 3\u2032-base forms a mismatch with the template (Fig. 1). In fact, some HF DNA polymerase can non-specifically remove the 3\u2032 modified or unmodified base and start extension even though no mismatch occurs35. The removal of the fluorophore or quencher group from the probe results in the release of the fluorescent signal. Therefore, a probe can be used directly as a primer to initiate PCR amplification under the HF DNA polymerase and the emitted fluorescence during the amplification can be monitored during a real-time PCR amplification (Fig. 1). We call the new method as HF DNA polymerase mediated real-time PCR and defined the probe as HFman probe or fluorescent primer (Fig. 1). Compared with the conventional qPCR that requires a pair of primers and a probe, the new method needs only one HFman probe and one corresponding primer.\n",

For HFman probe, fluorophore group is allowed to be labelled at either 5\u2032 end or 3\u2032end. However, because only bases at the 3'-end of HFman probe can be removed by HF DNA polymerase, a 3\u2032 fluorophore labelling is thought to be more efficient than a 5\u2032 fluorophore labelling. To prove this hypothesis, we designed N9-probe-2 that has a fluorophore group at the 3\u2032 end, and performed a comparison between N9-probe-1 and N9-probe-2. The result showed that the reaction with N9-probe-2 had an earlier amplification curve with stronger fluorescence signal than that with N9-probe-1 (Fig. 2a), supporting a HFman probe with a 3\u2032-fluorophore group is more efficient than that with 5\u2032-fluorophore group.\n",

About 70% infectious diseases are caused by viruses that have higher mutation rates than bacteria and other non-viral pathogens. Therefore, it is difficult to find absolutely conserved genomic regions of some viruses (e.g. HIV-1) for primer and probe design. The presence of mismatch between primer/probe and template reduces the amplification efficiency and sensitivity of RT-qPCR, although the use of degenerate primers can slightly improve the assay. The principle of the new qPCR method mediated by the HF DNA polymerase requires the presence of mismatch to initiate the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity of HF enzyme for removing the 3\u2032 fluorophore- or quencher-modified base from the probe.

The templates forming mismatch with HFman probe have slightly higher efficiency than those forming mismatch with the reverse primer, possibly due to the mismatch between reverse primer and RNA templates which limits the speed of reverse transcription. To further test the effect of various mismatches between HFman probe and template on amplification efficiency, we synthesized four HFman probe with different bases at 3-end (Probe-A, -G, -C, and -T), and constructed four RNA templates that completely match to each of the probes (Supplementary Fig. S3).

There is a SNP (SNP rs671) with G\u2192A substitution in exon 12 of ALDH2 gene that causes a mutation of Glu487Lys and inactivates the enzyme activity36. We designed two allele-specific HFman probes (ALDH-probe-G and ALDH-probe-A) and a reverse primer for the detection of SNP rs671 of ALDH2. ALDH-probe-G and ALDH-probe-A were labelled by FAM (red) and CY5 (green), and completely match to homozygous wild (GG) and mutant (AA) alleles, respectively. According to the principle, the RT-qPCR with ALDH-probe-G can amplify the mutant type (AA), but not or inefficiently amplify the wild type of ALDH2 (GG). In contrast, the reaction with ALDH-probe-A can amplify the wild type (GG), but not or inefficiently amplify the mutant type of ALDH2 (AA). Both reactions can amplify the heterozygous type (GA). Comparison of the amplification curves showed that the curve with ALDH-probe-A was obviously earlier than that with ALDH-probe-G for homozygous allele GG, later for homozygous allele AA and similar to each other for heterozygous GA (Fig. 6). Therefore, the difference in Ct values was recommended to identify gene type. We calculated the difference in Ct value by the formula Ct-FAM minus Ct-CY5. The alleles GG, AA and GA were clearly distinguished by the Ct differences of 12.98, \u22127.72 and 0.72, respectively (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the new RT-qPCR can also be developed to efficiently detect SNP.\n",

Furthermore, the TaqMan probe-based qPCR often limits the amplicon length between 50\u2013150 bps to achieve high amplification efficiency2. For highly heterogenetic viruses, however, it is very difficult to find three completely conserved regions in a relative short genomic region that satisfy the criteria of primer and probe design.

            "text": "In this study, we developed a novel, simple real-time qPCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Different from the conventional qPCR, the new qPCR only needs one primer and an HFman probe (Table 1). The generation of fluorescent signal was mediated by HF DNA polymerase that separates the fluorophore and quencher by the 3\u2032-5\u2032 hydrolysis of HFman probe. In principle, the HF DNA polymerase only removes the mismatched nucleotide from the primer or probe by its 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity (Table 1). However, majority of the HF DNA polymerases show non-specific 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity and also remove the completely matched 3\u2032-base of HFman probe possibly due to the modification of fluorophore or quencher activate the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity of HF DNA polymerase (Fig. 1)34. Therefore, regardless of match or mismatch between HFman/primer and target template, the new qPCR exhibits similar amplification efficiencies (Fig. 3a), indicating that the new method adapts well to the amplification of various mutation templates. These imply that the new HFman probe-based method is more efficient for the detection of highly variable viruses than the conventional TaqMan probe-based qPCR. Additionally, the new method has similar amplification efficiencies for different sizes (from 55 to 250 bps) of amplicons (Supplementary Fig. S4), and does not require an HFman with 10 \u00b0C higher Tm value than that of primers (Table 1). These make the primer and probe design easier and more flexible because the new method requires one HFman probe and one primer, whereas the conventional qPCR method requires one TaqMan probe and a pair of primers (Table 1). One major limitation in the primer and probe selection for the new method is that it does not allow the formation of primer dimers which may result in non-specific result.\n",

We developed a HIV-1 assay with a limit of detection (LOD) of 23 copies/ml using the new method (Supplementary Table S3). To evaluate the compatibility of our HIV-1 assay, we performed a comparison with COBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep /COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae HIV-1 Test, v2.0, the most widely used kit worldwide with highest detection sensitivity for HIV-1 quantification, using 21 HIV-1 positive clinical samples covering HIV-1 subtypes B, CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and CRF08_BC. All these samples could be detected by the Roche kit (VL: from 189 to 6010000 copies/ml) and our new method (VL: from 110 to 3781285 copies/ml) (Fig. 5c), and a good correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.79) was observed between both methods (Fig. 5c). In particular, our method detected 12 sample with higher viral loads than the Roche kit, possibly due to the well adaptation of our method to various variants. These results suggest that the HF DNA polymerase mediated RT-qPCR is comparable to the Roche kit and/or other commercial HIV-1 kits for HIV-1 quantification (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, we established assays for H7N9 (N9 gene), and human coronavirus NL63, and obtained well amplification and standard curves (Supplementary Fig. S6), indicating that the new method is suitable for the detection of other viruses. HF DNA polymerase can mediate the proof-reading (PR-) PCR for SNP and mutation detection34. We previously developed a modified PR-PCR using a ddNTP-blocked primer and a mixture of Taq DNA polymerases and HF DNA polymerase to high-efficient detection of various mutations35. Based on the similarity in the principle, we modified the new method by using an enzyme mixture of 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase and 0.1 U Q5 DNA polymerase and extended its application to SNP detection. A good performance was observed when SNP rs671 of ALDH2 was detected (Fig. 6).",
