Moreover, at least HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are naturally neuroinvasive and neurotropic in humans [5]. Indeed, we have previously reported that HCoV can infect and persist in human neural cells [6\u20138], and in human brains [9]. Moreover, the OC43 strain (HCoV-OC43) induces encephalitis in susceptible mice, with neurons being the main target of infection [10, 11].",

This creates a functional PC-cleavage site between the S1 and S2 portions of the viral S glycoprotein, thereby modulating viral spread and neurovirulence in susceptible mice, without affecting the neuroinvasive capacities of the virus or its infectivity (capacity to infect) of a neuronal cell line. These results, which suggest that PC-cleavage can be dispensable for efficient infection by HCoV-OC43, appear surprising compared to other coronaviruses, for which S protein cleavage is required for efficient virus infection [21, 23, 24]. Importantly, our results may help to better characterize the possible adaptation of HCoV-OC43 to the CNS environment, which, in the end, results in a decreased neurovirulence potentially associated to a modified spreading and a more efficient mechanism for the establishment of a persistent infection in human CNS, a phenomenon that could influence the severity of human viral encephalitis or exacerbate neurological degenerative pathologies of unknown etiologies.",

Accordingly, we introduced this mutation in the infectious cDNA clone of HCoV-OC43 (pBAC-OC43FL) [25] to produce a recombinant mutated rOC/SG758R virus, and we first studied its neuroinvasive and neurovirulent properties compared to reference rOC/ATCC virus (Fig 1). For this, 10 day-old BALB/c mice were inoculated by the intranasal (IN) route [10, 14] and survival curves were obtained (Fig 1A). After infection with the reference virus, over half of BALB/c mice died within the first 15 days post-infection, with symptoms of social isolation and hunched backs. In comparison, the viral mutant was less neurovirulent, with about 30% of mortality. Despite this difference in survival, there were no changes in the symptoms induced by the mutant virus compared to reference strain. Mice were also investigated for variation of weight during infection (Fig 1B) as previously described [14]: mice infected with mutant virus showed a delay in body weight gain of about 50% at 9 days post-infection compared to control mice. Comparison of survival curves of mice infected by both variants, coupled with weight variations, suggested that the rOC/SG758R variant was less neurovirulent than reference virus rOC/ATCC after inoculation by the IN route.",

Even though the difference in neurovirulence between the two viruses did not correlate with a different amount in production of infectious viral particles in the CNS (brain and spinal cord), there was a delay in viral replication kinetics of the mutant virus compared to reference virus. Viral spread in mouse brain (Fig 2) was also studied with a focus on the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus regions, because we have previously determined that these regions are primarily infected by the reference virus strain [14]. At 5 dpi, viral antigens were already present everywhere in the olfactory bulb infected by the reference wild-type virus (Fig 2A), compared to mutant virus for which antigens were only scarcely distributed. At 7 dpi, the kinetics was restored as the mutant infected this region as efficiently as the reference virus. In the hippocampus, we observed the same trend: no viral antigens were detected in this region for the mutant virus at 7 dpi, whereas the spread of both viruses was similar at 9 dpi (Fig 2B). When viruses had spread to all regions of the brain, activation of astrocytes and microglial cells was evident in all infected regions (S1 Fig). Even though no precise quantitation was performed, a slight increase in the number of astrocytes was observed in the olfactory bulb (S1A Fig) and in the hippocampus (S1B Fig) of mice infected by the reference virus compared to mutant virus. Activation of microglial cells was evident in the hippocampus region for both variants at 9 dpi (S1C Fig). As the mutant virus S protein harbors a SNP present in respiratory clinical isolates, we also evaluated viral dissemination towards the respiratory tract. Neither infectious virus particles nor viral RNA were detectable in the lungs of all the mice tested.",

We then measured the weight of mice during the infection (Fig 3B), and observed that there was a significant delay in body weight gain for the reference virus and the mutant virus compared to the sham control between 7 and 11 dpi, which correlates with the survival curves. Using a clinical score scale based on neurological symptoms of mice described in the Materials and Methods section [26], we next studied the clinical symptoms of mice after injection of both variants (Fig 3C and 3D). The only clinical sign caused by mutant virus was the abnormal flexion of the four limbs (level 1) whereas mice infected by the reference virus developed encephalitis associated with the 4 different levels of clinical scores.

Brains and spinal cords were harvested and infectious virus titers were assayed every 2 days for a period of 21 dpi (Fig 3E and 3F). The difference in neurovirulence did not correlate with a significant difference in the amount of infectious viral particles in the brain (Fig 3E). However, there was a drastic difference in the production of infectious virus between both variants in the spinal cord (Fig 3F): virus titers of the reference strain (rOC/ATCC) were almost identical to what was detected in the brain, whereas the less virulent mutant (rOC/SG758R) reached the spinal cord only in one out of thirty infected mice. In this mouse, an important delay and a production of viral infectious particles close to the limit of detection suggested that mutant virus had difficulty reaching this portion of the CNS. Histological examination of infected mice revealed that the infected regions were similar following infection by both viruses in the brain, but that the kinetics were different (Fig 4). Indeed, as was the case after the IN route of infection, the IC route of infection also led to a delay in viral replication in the olfactory bulb and in the hippocampus, as no viral antigens were detected before 7 dpi for the mutant virus (compared to 5 dpi for the reference virus). As in 10 day-old BALB/c mice infected IN, when virus had spread to all regions of the brain, activation of astrocytes and microglial cells was evident in all infected regions (S2 Fig). As seen in 10 day-old mice after IN inoculation, even though no precise quantitation was performed, a slight increase in the number of astrocytes in the olfactory bulb (S2A Fig) and in the hippocampus (S2B Fig) could be observed in brains of mice infected by reference virus compared to the mutant virus. The same was observed for microglial cells at 7 dpi in the olfactory bulb (S2C Fig) and in the hippocampus (S2D Fig).",

            "text": "In order to further study the role of the G758R mutation on the biology of both HCoV-OC43 variants, we first evaluated the kinetics of viral replication and spread within mixed primary CNS cultures from BALB/c mice over a period of 72 h post-infection (hpi). Using immunofluorescence, we observed no change in cell tropism, with neurons remaining the main target of infection by both virus variants (Fig 5), even though astrocytes could also be infected later in the infection (S3 Fig) as we previously reported [10]. Interestingly, we did observe a delay in viral spread in neurons for the mutant virus at 8 and 24 hpi compared to the reference strain (Fig 5). Interestingly, even though the infection was shown to be productive for both variants in primary CNS cultures from BALB/c mice, there was a significant increase in the total amount of infectious virus in the cell culture supernatant (free virus) between 48 and 72 hpi for the mutant virus compared to the reference virus rOC/ATCC (Fig 6B). As the G758R mutation creates a putative furin-like cleavage site [16] in the S glycoprotein previously reported to influence viral infectivity [20\u201322, 24], we wished to evaluate whether cleavage was indeed associated with the delayed spreading in neuronal cells, the increased release of infectious virus and eventually with neurovirulence. As seen in Fig 6, our data correlated with a much stronger cleavage of the S protein of the rOC/SG758R mutant into S1/S2 fragments, compared to reference virus rOC/ATCC at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig 6C; whole cell lysate), which was even more obvious at 48 hpi in the cell supernatant (Fig 6D). In order to evaluate whether this cleavage of the viral S protein also took place in human cells, we made use of the differentiated LA-N-5 neuronal cell line described in the Materials and Methods section [27] and showed, first, that the kinetics of viral replication was similar to that observed between both viruses in murine primary cells (Fig 7A and 7B), as there was a significant increase of virus release for the rOC/SG758R mutant and, second, that the cleavage of the S protein into S1/S2 fragments was again predominantly detected in the cell culture supernatant (Fig 7D) compared to the protein associated with cells (Fig 7C). Again, this cleavage was more evident for mutant than for reference virus. Similar results were obtained with HRT-18 cells. Even though the S protein of HCoV-OC43 reference virus was present mostly in the uncleaved form, our results also show that there are intermediate size bands between the uncleaved and furin-like cleaved forms of the protein. These secondary bands may be unspecific degradation products, but we suggest that among these intermediate size fragments seen on SDS-PAGE, there could be a fragment corresponding to the S protein cleaved at a potential alternative site (S2\u2019 in Figs 6, 7, 8 and S4, the latter showing corresponding overexpositions).",

Differentiated LA-N-5 cells were infected in the presence of different concentrations of the decanoylated furin-like inhibitor (dec-RVKR-cmk), and at 48 hpi, proteins in the supernatant were harvested and analyzed (Fig 8). As expected, the S glycoprotein of the reference virus was not cleaved at all (Fig 8A) whereas the cleavage of the S protein of mutant virus was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by dec-RVKR-cmk (Fig 8B). To evaluate whether the kinetics of viral replication was also affected, supernatants were harvested over a period of 48 hpi, and evaluation of infectious viral particles revealed no significant differences (S5 Fig). As the furin-like inhibitor reduced the cleavage of the S protein for the rOC/SG758R variant, we sought to identify which proprotein convertase(s) could play a role in cleavage of the S glycoprotein during infection. As shown in Fig 8C and 8D, a synthetic peptide containing the sequence of reference virus (RRSRG), was only cleaved by recombinant furin after 15 hours, likely at RRSR\u2193G. On the other hand, the synthetic peptide containing the sequence of mutant virus (RRSRR) was cleaved in only 30\u201360 minutes, likely at RRSR\u2193R, by furin and less so by three additional proprotein convertases: PACE4, PC5/6 and much less efficiently by PC7.",

Our observations by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), suggest that the typical coronavirus double crown-shape of the HCoV-OC43 virion was present in two different forms in cell supernatants that were harvested at 48 hpi during infection of mixed primary CNS cultures from BALB/c mice. Indeed, Fig 9A (left panel) represents the first type of morphology, which we named \u201clong\u201d for long S peplomers as measurements of the spike (S) and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) peplomer is shown for the same particle in the right panel. The same relative length of S and HE proteins were previously determined for other coronaviruses [28]. The second type of crown morphology, which we named \u201cshort\u201d for short S peplomers is presented in Fig 9B. This short S morphology shows normal HE peplomers of similar length. For a more accurate characterization of the spike length on viral particles from both variants, we measured the spike length of an equal number of virions (10 for each virus), for which the crown presented long (long S) or short (short S) peplomers (Fig 9C). The average length of the spike associated with a long S type of crown morphology was 24 nm, whereas the average length of the spikes on short S virions was about 15 nm. This apparent average difference of 9 nm represents a reduction of about 37.5% in the total length of the spike, which could presumably play a role in viral infectivity. Therefore, we next counted the number of viral particles that have a long-S or short-S crown for both viruses (Fig 9D) and found a significant difference, which tended to demonstrate that viral particles of the mutant virus were mostly in the short S state (about 72%) compared to the reference virus, which showed mainly long S crown (about 68%).",

No significant differences were found in the ratio of infectious viral particles over total viral particles (evaluated by the number of viral genome present in viral stocks used for all experiments), which establishes itself at 1/200 for both variants (Fig 9E). Furthermore the amount of viral RNA associated with infected LA-N-5 cells remained the same over a period of 16 hours (Fig 9F), suggesting that attachment and cell entry was similar for both viruses.",

However, this mutation was sufficient to modify viral spread and neurovirulence in susceptible mice by modulating the cleavage of the S protein, which appears related to furin-like activity in susceptible neuronal cells.",

Further studies are underway to try to identify other naturally occurring S mutations that could be important for viral spread to the respiratory tract in mice. Nevertheless, our results indicate that, despite the difference in neurovirulence, the recombinant virus rOC/SG758R retains its full neuroinvasive properties even though there was a delay in viral spread and in the production of infectious virus (Figs 1\u20134). This phenomenon may in part explain the mutant reduced neurovirulence accompanied by less severe neurological symptoms and a less frequent spread to the spinal cord, as previously reported for other S protein mutants of HCoV-OC43 [14] and for the murine coronavirus, MHV [29].",

The stronger astrogliosis and microgliosis observed after infection by the reference virus may also be related to a faster spread throughout the CNS compared to the mutant virus [14]. The same difference in viral spread was confirmed in primary cultures of mouse brain cells, where both variants were still infecting neurons as primary targets (Fig 5), even though astrocytes could also be infected (S3 Fig). This is in agreement with our previous reports in these cultures [14] and underlines the fact that the change in neurovirulence was not associated with a change in cell tropism as was previously shown for MHV [31], but could rather be related to a modification in the spread between infected neurons. The differential neurovirulence and spread could certainly be the consequence of the G758R mutation in the S protein, which introduces a typical furin-like recognition site [16, 32] probably recognized by cellular proprotein convertases (PCs) as this mutation was the only difference found in the whole genome of both recombinant viruses used in the present study. Proteolytic cleavage of coronaviruses S proteins was characterized several years ago for the murine coronavirus [33]. Since then, several reports have indicated that PCs appear to be important for cell-cell fusion and/or virus entry into host cells [21\u201323], or during transport of the newly assembled virions through the secretory pathway of the producer cell [21, 34\u201336] for different coronaviruses including MHV, SARS-CoV and FIPV[21, 23, 37, 38].",

This S1/S2 cleaved version of the S protein is easily detected in the free virus present in cell culture supernatant but it is barely detectable in cell-associated proteins. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that this cleavage of S takes place during the late steps of infection, probably during particle assembly and egress, as it was previously shown for MERS-CoV [35] and MHV [39]. Furthermore, cleavage of the HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein also has an impact on pathology, as it decreases neurovirulence and spread within the CNS. It is highly interesting to note that this association between decreased virulence and cleavage of coronavirus S glycoprotein was only suggested for FCoV [32]. In fact, for other coronaviruses, including the murine (MHV) and the bovine coronavirus (BCoV), no clear association was established between S cleavage and virulence [40, 41].",

Inhibition of furin-like protease (PCs) was already demonstrated for other coronaviruses like MERS-CoV and MHV with the same type of inhibitor [21, 35]. These results are supported by observation of S protein in reference virus rOC/ATCC (Fig 8A) for which the ratio of uncleaved S protein over S1/S2 cleaved form remained equal at all inhibitor concentrations. In contrast, this ratio increased for mutant virus rOC/SG758R (Fig 8B) in a dose-dependent manner. Results presented in Fig 8C and 8D bring even more interesting new information about which of these proteases could be involved in the actual cleavage. Indeed, the synthetic peptide harboring the G758R mutation was cleaved with much more efficiency by PCs than the model peptide mimicking the reference virus S protein. Furthermore, even though furin represented the most efficient convertase, PC5/6 and PACE4, and to a much lesser extent PC7, were also able to cleave the synthetic peptide and could therefore cleave the HCoV-OC43 S protein during infection of susceptible cells as it was previously shown for SARS-CoV [42]. Inhibition of furin-like activity during infection of human neuronal cells, lead us to suggest that PCs (most notably furin) are the cognate proteases involved in the S protein cleavage at amino acid 758 (Fig 8).",

Moreover, inhibition of furin-like-activity did not influence the capacity of the viruses to enter these cells (S5 Fig).

Indeed, the delays in spreading in both primary cultures (Fig 5) and within the CNS (Fig 2) were observed despite a more efficient release of infectious rOC/SG758R particles in the cell culture medium as compared to the reference rOC/ATCC virus, a relationship that may seem counterintuitive but is in fact reminiscent of the cell-to-cell mode of propagation prevailing for a growing list of viruses [48]. For example, HTLV-1 is famously inefficient at spreading through free-virus particles diffusion, the particles remaining instead associated to the plasma membrane from where productive transfer towards target cell occurs [49, 50]. By analogy, it is tempting to speculate that S1/S2 HCoV-OC43 spike cleavage limits the amount of particles at the plasma membrane available for a cell-to-cell transfer to naive neurons. This can explain the difference in kinetics of dissemination between both viruses and the difficulty for mutant rOC/SG758R to reach the spinal cord even though it does disseminate throughout the brain. This hypothesis may appear in contradiction with the previously documented positive impact of S1/S2 spike cleavage on MHV and SARS-CoV cell-to-cell transfer occurring upon fusion-dependent syncytium formation [21, 22, 39]. Furthermore, even though syncytium formation upon MHV infection has often been linked to S cleavage, in some instances, this type of cell-cell fusion was shown to occur without cleavage of the S protein [51\u201353] and the MHV-2 strain S protein can be cleaved without being able to induce syncytia [54]. In fact, regardless of the cleavage status of its S protein, HCoV-OC43 was never able to induce syncytia in any type of cells we studied and we therefore tend to think that distinct, but not mutually exclusive, cell-to-cell propagation mechanisms may prevail among coronaviruses like it does for other enveloped viruses, especially within the CNS, where cell-cell movement of viruses may take place at synapses [48]. Altogether, these observations suggest that the influence of spike cleavage on coronavirus propagation is not an absolute prerequisite and therefore, cannot per se predict accurately the efficiency of cell-to-cell spread. The reasons underlying this variable outcome are still unclear but may well reside in the different virus receptors, structural features and attachment factors exploited by coronaviruses. Given the expected influence of virus spread on neurovirulence, host survival and potentially establishment of CNS viral persistence, further studies are indeed warranted to characterize the underlying mechanisms associated with HCoV-OC43 spread within the CNS.",

            "text": "Taken together, the results of the current study indicate for the first time that HCoV-OC43 is clearly able to infect neuronal cells and to spread with or without the need for a furin-like S protein cleavage. The difference in viral spread within CNS and in brain primary cultures, associated with the increase of infectious viral particles in the culture medium for the virus harboring the G758R mutation present in all known clinical isolates, as well as the absence of modification in infectivity between the two viruses, strongly suggests that the PC-activity-associated cleavage of HCoV-OC43 S protein plays a more important role during the egress and viral budding from infected cells, which could influence the mode of viral transmission between CNS cells. This is of importance to better understand the mechanisms underlying viral spread within the CNS, potentially associated with an adaptation of HCoV-OC43 to this particular environment. Even though HCoV-OC43 reference strain is highly neurovirulent, we have already shown that its RNA persists in the mouse CNS for up to one year in a significant proportion of infected mice [10]. Nevertheless, the delayed dissemination and reduced neurovirulence of mutant rOC/SG758R increase host survival and therefore could favor the establishment of CNS viral persistence associated with a potential viral adaptation to the CNS environment, which could result in the selection of better adapted quasi-species, as it was shown for MHV [58]. In the end, such a persistent infection in the human CNS could, in certain circumstances, be associated with recurrent human encephalitis or neurological degenerative pathologies. Therefore, the observation that HCoVs are naturally neuroinvasive in both mice and humans [9, 59, 60] underlines the need to further characterize viral and cellular determinants of these neuroinvasive properties. Understanding mechanisms and consequences of virus interactions with the nervous system is essential to better understand potentially pathologically relevant consequences and in the design of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including modulation of host proteases such as proprotein convertases.",

The recombinant HCoV-OC43 virus (rOC/ATCC) was generated using the full-length cDNA clone pBAC-OC43FL and displayed the same phenotypic properties as the wild-type virus, as previously described [25]. This recombinant virus was used as the reference control virus for all experiments. Using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange Multisite-directed mutagenesis kit) as recommended by the supplier, we introduced a point mutation in the gene coding for the spike glycoprotein of HCoV-OC43 at nucleotide 2272, corresponding to an amino acid change at position 758 (corresponding recombinant virus designated rOC/SG758R). Each cDNA clone was transfected in BHK-21 cells, amplified by two passages in the HRT-18 cell line, and sequenced to make sure that only the introduced G758R mutation was present and that no other mutations appeared. The HRT-18 cell line (a gift from the late David Brian, University of Tennessee) was cultured in minimal essential medium alpha (MEM-alpha; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA GE Healthcare) and was used to produce viral stocks. The LA-N-5 cell line (a kind gift of Stephan Ladisch, George Washington University School of Medicine) was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 \u03bcM non-essential amino acids (Gibco- Invitrogen). LA-N-5 cells were differentiated into human neurons as previously described [61]. Briefly, cells were seeded in Cell+ petri dishes (5x105 cells in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 \u03bcM non-essential amino acids.
