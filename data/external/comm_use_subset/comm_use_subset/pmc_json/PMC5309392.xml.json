            "text": "The treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases has improved considerably over the last 20 years with the advent of biological therapeutics. TNF\u03b1 was the first cytokine to be fully validated as a therapeutic target in RA (1). TNF\u03b1 inhibitors (TNFi) have revolutionized treatment of RA and have been used in over a million patients worldwide (2). Despite the good clinical response observed in many patients, TNF\u03b1 blockade does not offer a curative treatment; approximately one-third of patients do not respond and loss of efficacy is frequently observed (3). Importantly, it is currently not possible to predict which patients will respond to TNFi therapy. In addition, in some inflammatory diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (4, 5) and multiple sclerosis (6), TNFi have not shown clinical efficacy. Furthermore, and paradoxically, some patients treated with TNFi develop de novo autoimmune diseases (7). These observations indicate that the underlying mechanisms relating to TNF blockade in humans are incompletely understood and require further exploration. The effects of TNFi are more wide-ranging than simply neutralizing the biological activity of soluble and membrane-bound TNF\u03b1 (mTNF\u03b1). For example, by binding mTNF\u03b1, anti-TNF mAbs can mediate cell death by complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (8\u201311). TNF\u03b1 inhibitors have also been shown to affect downstream cytokine pathways (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) (2), modulate APC function (12), and promote regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion (13\u201315) although opposite findings regarding the latter have been reported (16\u201319).",

It was shown both cross-sectionally and longitudinally that inflammatory arthritis patients on TNFi therapy have an increased frequency of peripheral blood (PB) IL-10+ CD4+ T cells. These in vivo findings were reproduced in vitro by coculturing CD4+ T cells from healthy donors with autologous CD14+ monocytes and anti-CD3 mAb, in the presence of different TNFi drugs (adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, or certolizumab) (20). Furthermore, we showed an increase in the percentage of IL-10 co-expressing IL-17+ CD4+ T cells, suggesting that otherwise pro-inflammatory cells displayed anti-inflammatory potential. Indeed, re-sorted TNFi-exposed IL-17+ CD4+ T cells secreted increased levels of IL-10, which was biologically active and could modulate markers of monocyte activation (20).",

In this study, we therefore investigated in vitro whether TNF blockade regulates IL-10 expression in other pro-inflammatory cytokine-producing T cell subsets, whether blockade of other cytokines or T cell activation pathways also drives IL-10 expression, and how TNF blockade may manifest its IL-10-regulating effect on T cells.",

After 3 days, cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of GolgiStop for 3 h and stained for cytokine expression (gating strategy shown in Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). In agreement with our previous data (20), TNF blockade led to a significant increase in IL-10+ cells within total CD4+ T cells as well as in the IL-17+ CD4+ T cell subset. In addition, we found a strong increase in IL-10-expressing cells within IFN\u03b3+, TNF\u03b1+, GM-CSF+, and IL-4+ CD4+ T cell populations (Figures 1A,B). TNF blockade did not alter the frequencies of IFN\u03b3+, TNF\u03b1+, or GM-CSF+ CD4+ T cell populations but did induce a modest increase in IL-17+ CD4+ T cells, as previously shown (20), and in most donors in IL-4+ frequencies, although this did not reach statistical significance (Figures S2A, B in Supplementary Material). Addition of an isotype control human IgG1 mAb did not promote IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material).",

We investigated whether blockade of additional pro-inflammatory pathways could promote IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells. Blockade of IL-17A did not enhance the frequencies of IL-10+ cells in any of the CD4+ T cell populations tested (Figure 4A). Blockade of IFN\u03b3 did not affect the percentage of IL-10+ cells within total CD4+ T cells, or within IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1+ subpopulations, but led to modestly increased frequencies of IL-10+ expressing cells within the IL-17+ population, although this effect was much weaker than the effect of TNF blockade in parallel cultures (Figure 4A). Addition of tocilizumab (IL-6R blockade) or abatacept (CTLA4-Ig, which blocks CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation), both of which are biologic drugs routinely used in the clinic to treat rheumatoid arthritis, did not increase IL-10+ frequencies in CD4+ T cells, IL-17+, IFN\u03b3+, or TNF\u03b1+ CD4+ T cell subpopulations (Figure 4B). To determine whether blockade of these pathways might regulate IL-10 expression with different kinetics to TNF blockade, IL-10+ frequencies were analyzed within both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at different time points in anti-CD3-stimulated PBMC cultures exposed to these antibodies or drugs. IL-10+ CD4+ and IL-10+ CD8+ T cell frequencies were not regulated at any time point by blockade of IL-17, IFN\u03b3, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation (Figure S5 in Supplementary Material). Blockade of IL-1R1 in CD4+ T cell/monocyte cocultures resulted in a significantly increased proportion of IL-10+ cells within total CD4+ T cells and within IL-17+, IFN\u03b3+, or TNF\u03b1+ subpopulations (Figure 4B). However, this effect was not replicated in either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in whole PBMC cultures (Figure S5 in Supplementary Material), indicating that the capacity of IL-1 blockade to regulate IL-10 expression may be dependent on the in vitro culture conditions. Together these data indicate that IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells can be regulated by blocking TNF\u03b1 signaling, but not by blocking IFN\u03b3, IL-17, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation, at least in vitro.",

To investigate this further, MACS-isolated CD4+ T cells were FACS sorted to very high purity (>99%) to yield either total CD4+ T cells or effector CD4+ CD25-CD127+ T cells (Teff; depleted of CD25high CD127low Treg).

Neutralizing antibodies against IL-10 and IL-10R were added to CD4+ T cell/monocyte cocultures stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb, in the presence or absence of TNF blockade, and intracellular cytokine expression was assessed after 3 days. Blockade of IL-10 signaling in the absence of adalimumab led to significantly reduced IL-10+ frequencies within total CD4+ T cells and within IL-17+, IFN\u03b3, or TNF\u03b1+ subpopulations (Figure 7A). When adalimumab and IL-10/IL-10R blocking mAbs were added in combination to the cocultures, a decrease in IL-10+ CD4+ T cell frequencies was observed as compared to the condition treated with adalimumab alone; however, an increase was still observed as compared to IL-10/IL-10R blockade alone. These data suggest that pathways additional to IL-10 signaling could play a role in the regulation of IL-10 expression by TNF blockade. Indeed, when we tested whether addition of exogenous IL-10 (10 ng/ml) could drive IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cell/monocyte cocultures, we found that this by itself was not sufficient to increase IL-10+ cell frequencies in total CD4+ T cells, or within IL-17+, IFN\u03b3+, or TNF\u03b1+ subpopulations. Addition of rhIL-10 even decreased the percentage of IL-10+ cells in total CD4+ T cells and TNF\u03b1+ CD4+ T cells (Figure 7B). The biological activity of the recombinant IL-10 was validated by culturing freshly isolated monocytes with 0, 10, or 100 ng/ml rhIL-10 for 20 h and confirming that rhIL-10 addition resulted in increased CD14 and CD163 and reduced HLA-DR expression by flow cytometry, in accordance with previous studies (33, 34) (n = 2, data not shown). We next investigated the regulation of IL-10 in response to rhIL-10 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using whole PBMC cultures assessed for IL-10 expression over a 5-day time course (Figure S5 in Supplementary Material). We found that at earlier time points (18\u201324 h), rhIL-10 addition reduced IL-10+ CD4+ T cell frequencies (n = 6, p = 0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test), while at later time points (66\u201372 and 114\u2013120 h), rhIL-10 slightly increased IL-10+ CD4+ T cell frequencies (n = 6, p = 0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). IL-10+ CD8+ T cell frequencies remained very low throughout, regardless of rhIL-10 addition. Together, these data indicate that IL-10 signaling contributes in part to TNF blockade-mediated regulation of IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells, but that other factors also play a role. The effects of exogenous IL-10 on regulating IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells appear to be dependent on both time and in vitro culture conditions.",

This phenomenon is observed in total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as within a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokine-expressing (IL-17+, IFN\u03b3+, TNF\u03b1+, GM-CSF+ or IL-4+) subpopulations. TNF blockade regulates IL-10 expression whether CD4+ T cells are stimulated in the presence or absence of monocytes, and when an antigenic stimulus is used in place of monoclonal anti-CD3 stimulation. We found that blockade of IL-17, IFN\u03b3, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation did not regulate IL-10 expression in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell subpopulations. Blocking antibodies to IL-1R1 resulted in increased IL-10+ CD4+ T cell frequencies when added to CD4+ T cell/monocyte cocultures, but this effect was not replicated in whole PBMC cultures. One explanation could be that additional cell types are present in PBMC cultures that can produce or respond to IL-1. Neither CD4+ CD25highCD127low Tregs nor IL-27 was required for TNF blockade to exert its IL-10-promoting effects.",

A small study of RA patients found that frequencies of IL-10+ PBMC were increased following treatment with infliximab (14). However, in the three patients studied, it was not confirmed which cell subset(s) expressed IL-10. Ebert later showed that supernatants from cultures of either monocytes (adherent PBMC) or T cells (non-adherent, CD14\u2212 CD20\u2212 HLA-DR\u2212 PBMC), contained increased IL-10 following exposure to infliximab in vitro (35). Antiga et al. demonstrated increased percentages of IL-10+ CD4+ T cells in T cell blasts isolated from skin lesions of psoriasis patients, following treatment with etanercept (36), and PB IL-10+ CD4+ T cells were also increased in posterior uveitis patients following treatment with a p55 TNF\u03b1 receptor fusion protein (37). Earlier studies assessing mouse transgenic T cells (38) or human CD4+ T cell clones (39) also found that TNF blockade led to increased IL-10 production in cell culture supernatants. In further support of our data, Boks et al. showed that blockade of TNF\u03b1 during in vitro priming of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells with tolerogenic DCs favored the development of IL-10+ CD4+ T cells (40). Thus, TNFi-mediated regulation of IL-10 in CD4+ T cells has been indicated by a growing number of in vitro and ex vivo studies.",

However, in contrast to these other studies, which used na\u00efve CD4+ T cells, our analysis of intracellular cytokine expression did not demonstrate increased IL-10+ CD4+ T cell frequencies after 3 days in culture with IL-27.
