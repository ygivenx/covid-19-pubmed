            "text": "Members of the family Flaviviridae are of major human health concern, and in several cases, the development of effective options for the prevention and treatment of infections caused by these viruses is urgently awaited. The Flaviviridae family comprises a wide variety of enveloped viruses possessing an RNA genome of positive polarity, and it is subdivided into four genera: Hepacivirus, Flavivirus, Pegivirus, and Pestivirus (1). While several new hepaciviruses were recently discovered in a variety of species (2), the most prominent member, hepatitis C virus (HCV), is responsible for chronic infection in >71 million individuals worldwide, which are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (3). The genus Flavivirus encompasses 53 species and comprises a number of vector-borne, zoonotic agents responsible for acute and self-limiting diseases, which can, in some cases, lead to severe symptoms (vascular leakage, hemorrhage, encephalitis, meningitis) (4). As has been observed for Zika virus (ZIKV), which has recently spread throughout South and Central America and the Caribbean (5), several flaviviruses are considered emerging or reemerging pathogens and can rapidly become endemic, thereby leading to serious short- or long-term health consequences (6). Hepaciviruses and flaviviruses are therefore a major human health concern. The newly proposed genus Pegivirus as well as the genus Pestivirus mainly comprises virus species of veterinary relevance that cause gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive diseases in animals, which are associated with major economic losses (7\u20139).",

Following attachment to the surface of the host cell and binding of the cellular entry receptor, viral particles are internalized via the endocytic route and incoming genomes are released into the cytosol. A single open reading frame (ORF) encodes both structural proteins composing the viral particles (capsid/core, prM, and envelope glycoproteins) (10) and nonstructural proteins primarily forming the viral replicase complex that ensures polyprotein processing, membrane reorganization, and RNA synthesis functions. Upon translation, the viral replicase is inserted in endoplasmic reticulum membranes, where it orchestrates the establishment of replication organelles. These organelles provide privileged, membrane-protected sites with which viral RNA synthesis is closely associated (11). Given that virus-induced membrane remodeling is a conserved mechanism among virtually all positive-sense RNA viruses, it represents an attractive target for the development of panviral inhibitors effective against a wide range of viruses.",

The compound has been shown to act on early postentry stages of coronavirus replication and to target membrane-bound viral RNA synthesis. Moreover, K22 strongly prevented the formation of typical HCoV-229E-induced perinuclear double membrane vesicle (DMV) clusters. A study by Lundin et al. further extended the initial finding of the mechanism by which K22 inhibits HCoV-229E replication and demonstrated a potent pancoronavirus antiviral activity of K22 (12). Indeed, K22 inhibited a broad range of coronaviruses from several phylogenetic lineages (alpha-, beta-, and gammacoronaviruses), including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), type I feline coronavirus (FCoV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), as well as the highly pathogenic human severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (12). Furthermore, it was recently reported that K22 impairs the replication of not only viruses in the Coronavirinae subfamily but also members of the Torovirinae subfamily, such as white beam virus (WBV; genus Bafinivirus) and equine torovirus (EToV; genus Torovirus), as well as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV), which are representative arteriviruses (13).",

Collectively, our study indicates a broad antiviral activity of K22 against a wide range of Nidoviridae and Flaviviridae lineages and suggests that interfering with conserved mechanisms of membrane rearrangements and the biogenesis of replication organelles could represent a novel target for the development of antiviral drugs to combat positive-sense RNA virus infections.",

To test this hypothesis, K22-treated cells were infected with ZIKV and virus replication was assessed at 24 and 48 h postinfection (p.i.) by measuring the intracellular levels of E proteins by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells harboring replicating virus, reflected by E protein expression, was significantly decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, upon treatment of cells with K22 at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 1a). Titration of the viral supernatant confirmed the significant inhibition of ZIKV infectivity upon K22 treatment at both time points, i.e., at 24 and 48 h p.i., with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 2.5 \u03bcM and 2.1 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 1). Indeed, 5 or 10 \u03bcM K22 was sufficient to reduce the viral titers by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Higher concentrations of K22 reduced viral titers by up to 4 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1b). Flow cytometric analysis revealed no cytotoxic effect of K22 at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 1c, as determined upon application of a Fixable Aqua dead cell stain kit. These results were confirmed upon assessment of cytotoxicity using a commercially available kit (Fig. 1d). However, similar to what has been previously reported (12), K22 concentrations of \u226530 \u03bcM mildly affected cell proliferation (Fig. 1d; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), suggesting that the observed antiviral effects at concentrations of \u226530 \u03bcM were slightly overestimated. In order to determine which step of the viral replication cycle is affected by K22, we performed time-of-addition experiments. To exclude the possibility of direct effects of K22 on viral particles, e.g., disruption of the viral envelope or interference with virion stability, we preincubated ZIKV with increasing K22 concentrations and subsequently assessed the remaining infectivity by titration. We showed that preincubation of K22 does not affect ZIKV infectivity (Fig. 1e). Next, K22 was added to the cells at different times pre- or postinfection, and the effects on viral replication and infectivity were determined by titration of the viral supernatant. Interestingly, K22 also displayed antiviral activity when added at several hours postinfection, suggesting an effect on postentry stages of the ZIKV life cycle (Fig. 1f). Collectively, our data reveal that K22 significantly inhibits ZIKV in a dose-dependent manner, likely by impairing a critical postentry step in the ZIKV life cycle.",

To this end, we tested the K22 sensitivity of different flaviviruses, including JEV, YFV, WNV, USUV, and WESSV, as well as the hepacivirus HCV and the two representative pestivirus BVDV biotypes (cytopathogenic [Cp] and noncytopathogenic [Ncp]) of a bovine viral diarrhea pestivirus pair. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of K22 and infected. Intracellular levels of the flavivirus E protein, as a marker of viral replication, were assessed by flow cytometry. Moreover, viral titers in the supernatant were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) titration. This showed that both JEV and YFV replication (Fig. 2a and c) and infectivity (Fig. 2b and d) were reduced by K22 concentrations starting from 5 \u03bcM K22 in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50s being between 0.5 and 4.4 \u03bcM (Table 1). WNV (Fig. 2e and f) replication as well as infectivity was significantly reduced at K22 concentrations of \u226510 \u03bcM, with IC50s being 2.8 \u03bcM at 24 h and 8.4 \u03bcM at 48 h (Table 1). Slightly higher K22 concentrations (\u226520 \u03bcM) were necessary to significantly inhibit USUV (Fig. 2g and h) and WESSV (Fig. 2i and j), with IC50s being between 5.9 and 10 \u03bcM (Table 1). To analyze the antiviral effect of K22 on the hepacivirus HCV, a luciferase-encoding reporter virus was used, and virus-mediated intracellular luciferase expression was measured as a marker for viral replication. Furthermore, to rule out the possibility that K22 has an impact on the luciferase reporter activity, a nonreporter HCV construct (HCV Jc1) was employed and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of HCV RNA levels was performed (Fig. S2). In addition, the viral supernatant from infected, K22-treated cells was harvested and used to inoculate naive target cells before the latter were lysed and luciferase reporter activity was determined (infectivity). Similar to the findings for WNV and USUV, K22 concentrations of \u226520 \u03bcM led to a significant reduction of viral replication as well as infectivity (Fig. 3a and b and S2). However, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assays indicated that the cells used for infection were affected by K22 concentrations of \u226520 \u03bcM (Fig. 3c). Nevertheless, a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) value (21.3 \u03bcM) 3-fold higher than the IC50 (7.0 \u03bcM) (Table 2) revealed an antiviral effect of K22 on HCV which could be distinguished from the effect on cell viability. Nevertheless, careful interpretation of the data is still required, as the antiviral effect displayed by K22 may be overestimated in the context of HCV infections. Two biotypes of BVDV strain Suwa were tested for their susceptibility to K22 treatment. Viral RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR as a correlate for viral replication, and viral titers in the supernatant were assessed by titration. Similar to the findings for HCV, K22 concentrations of \u226520 \u03bcM and \u226540 \u03bcM were necessary to significantly reduce the viral replication of Cp BVDV strain Suwa (BVDV SuwaCp) (Fig. 3e) and Ncp BVDV strain Suwa (BVDV SuwaNcp) (Fig. 3g), respectively. Viral titers were significantly reduced upon treatment with 20 to 50 \u03bcM K22 for BVDV SuwaCp (Fig. 3f), with the IC50 being 14.2 \u03bcM (Table 2), whereas at least 40 \u03bcM K22 was necessary to significantly reduce the infectivity of BVDV SuwaNcp, with the IC50 being 21.4 \u03bcM (Fig. 3h; Table 2). Of note, even though no cellular toxicity resulting from K22 incubations at the concentrations indicated above could be measured, cell proliferation was affected at K22 concentrations of \u226530 \u03bcM, as described before (Fig. 3d; Table 2). Collectively, our data show that K22 inhibits a broad range of Flaviviridae members, including JEV, YFV, WNV, USUV, WESSV, and, to a limited extent, HCV and BVDV.",

            "text": "Treatment options against members of the family Flaviviridae remain limited, despite the recent success regarding the treatment of HCV infections with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) (14). The recent ZIKV epidemic further underscored the importance of effective viral inhibitors, which can be applicable to rapidly control outbreaks of (re)emerging viruses. Ribavirin (RBV) and interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) have been employed for their well-documented antiviral activity against several RNA viruses (15). We therefore evaluated the antiviral potential of a combination regimen of K22 together with RBV or IFN-\u03b1 against ZIKV. To this end, cells were treated either with K22, RBV, or IFN-\u03b1 alone or with a two drug-combination and subsequently infected for 24 h before the viral titers in the supernatant were determined by a TCID50 assay. A single treatment with 5 or 10 \u03bcM K22 was sufficient to significantly reduce the viral titers (Fig. 4a). A single treatment with 10 \u03bcg/ml RBV moderately reduced the viral titers, whereas increased concentrations of 100 \u03bcg/ml and 1,000 \u03bcg/ml correlated with significantly reduced viral titers in the supernatant (Fig. 4b). However, high RBV concentrations (100 \u03bcg/ml to 1,000 \u03bcg/ml) also impacted cell viability (Fig. S3b). IFN-\u03b1 was effective against ZIKV at doses of \u226510 IU (Fig. 4c), with no effect on cell viability (Fig. S3c). A combination treatment of K22 with either 0.1 or 1 \u03bcg/ml RBV did not improve the antiviral effect of K22; however, the addition of at least 10 \u03bcg/ml RBV in combination with low K22 concentrations (5 to 10 \u03bcM) increased the overall antiviral effect (Fig. 4d and g). Furthermore, a combination of 10 or 20 \u03bcM K22 together with 100 \u03bcg/ml RBV reduced the viral titers by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude compared to those for the untreated control (Fig. 4d and g). Similarly, combination treatment with doses of \u226510 IU IFN-\u03b1 together with K22 potentiated the antiviral effect (Fig. 4e and g). In particular, 5 to 10 \u03bcM K22 combined with \u226510 IU IFN-\u03b1 resulted in viral titers reduced by at least 3 orders of magnitude without any further impact on cell proliferation (Fig. 4e and S3e). Combination treatments with RBV and IFN-\u03b1 at doses of \u2265100 IU IFN-\u03b1 and \u2265100 \u03bcg/ml RBV increased the antiviral effectiveness against ZIKV compared to that of either single treatment (Fig. 4f). Analysis of the drug combination K22 and RBV at concentrations in the range of the concentrations of each drug that caused only partial inhibition of replication pointed to an additive antiviral effect of the two compounds, indicated by combination indexes (CI) of about 1 (Fig. S4). For K22 combined with IFN-\u03b1, a slight synergism was observed for 10 IU IFN-\u03b1 (\u2a606.73 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u03bcM) and K22 concentrations between 10 and 30 \u03bcM, indicated by a CI of <1. In conclusion, K22 treatments in combination with RBV and IFN-\u03b1 allow the use of reduced K22 concentrations for a level of ZIKV replication impairment similar to that achieved with higher concentrations of K22, RBV, or IFN-\u03b1 alone while protecting the cells from potential K22- or RBV-induced cytotoxicity when used at high concentrations.",

We therefore assessed whether the antiviral effect of K22 observed against Flaviviridae, specifically, against ZIKV, correlates with the impaired establishment of ZIKV-induced replication organelles. To this end, ZIKV-infected cells were fixed at 48 h p.i. and assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the vast majority of cells were infected, as both viral E protein and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) were efficiently detected in most cells (Fig. 5, left). In concordance with previous results (Fig. 1), both markers of viral infection were severely reduced upon K22 treatment (30 \u03bcM), thereby confirming the potent antiviral effect of K22 on ZIKV infections (Fig. 5, right). Additional immunofluorescence analyses with selected flaviviruses (JEV and WNV) further confirmed the antiviral activity of the compound (Fig. S5). Furthermore, ultrastructural ZIKV-induced membrane rearrangements were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Despite a vast majority of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells being infected (Fig. 5), structures reminiscent of well-described ZIKV membranous replication organelles were only occasionally observed in ZIKV-infected cells (Fig. 6). Fixation methods and cell type-specific determinants likely account for the morphological differences from previously reported ZIKV-induced membranous structures (16). Accordingly, it was also reported that certain replication-associated structures were absent in ZIKV-infected human neural progenitor cells and that vesicular structures were markedly smaller than the ones observed in ZIKV-infected Huh-7 cells (16). In sharp contrast, we repeatedly observed a striking accumulation of large vesicles in the cytosol of ZIKV-infected cells treated with K22, while morphological changes of cellular compartments (dilated vesicular structures) were only occasionally seen in noninfected cells treated with K22 (Fig. 6). These vesicles were notably larger than previously described ZIKV replication organelles (16), as vesicles of at least 500 nm in diameter were frequently observed, and these are unlikely to represent conventional ZIKV-induced replication organelles. Rather, they are suggestive of aberrant structures that do not support ZIKV replication as a result of K22 treatment.",

Especially, several members of the Flavivirus genus are considered (re)emerging viruses, which are defined as pathogens that have existed previously or have newly appeared in a population and are increasing in incidence or geographic range (17). Successful treatment of HCV infections has been achieved in the last couple of years with the development of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies (18). Moreover, favipiravir, also known as T-705 or Avigan, is in use against YFV and WNV infections (as well as infections caused by arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, and alphaviruses) (19), and host-directed compounds, such as cyclophilin inhibitors (20, 21) and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors (22), have been evaluated in clinical trials to control HCV and dengue virus (DENV) infections, respectively. Furthermore, prophylactic options, such as vaccination, have been developed for YFV, JEV, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (23), as well as for DENV, although the vaccine against DENV suffers from limited efficacy (24, 25). On the other hand, vaccines for humans to combat HCV, WNV, and ZIKV are not available (26). Taken together, the available panel of prophylactic and antiviral treatment options against flavivirus infections in human and animals remains limited, thus emphasizing the need for the development of effective and reliable drugs/vaccines.",

K22 has been shown to act on early postentry stages of coronavirus replication and to target membrane-bound RNA synthesis by interfering with the establishment of virus-induced replicative structures. Importantly, HCoV-229E mutants that were able to replicate in the presence of K22 were isolated following several virus passages on K22-treated cells. These escape mutants contained amino acid substitutions in nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6; H121L, M159V) that were associated with K22 resistance. Coronavirus nsp6 contains multiple membrane-spanning domains and is essential to membrane diversion events leading to the biogenesis of replication organelles (27). These findings thereby corroborate a critical step inhibited by K22 during membrane remodeling events.",

Moreover, combination treatment regimens with the approved broad-acting antivirals RBV and IFN-\u03b1 supported the antiviral effect of K22 on ZIKV. This finding implies not only that effective K22 concentrations can be substantially reduced but also that the therapeutic window of K22 can be improved.

Furthermore, compartmentalization protects viral replication intermediates, such as dsRNA, from recognition by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that elicit the first steps of a host innate immune response (30\u201332). Time-of-addition experiments in the context of ZIKV revealed that K22 acts at a postentry stage, presumably during the establishment of viral replication in the cytosol of the infected cell, reminiscent of the suggested mode of action in the context of HCoV-229E inhibition (12). Subsequent ultrastructural analyses of ZIKV-infected cells following K22 treatment revealed the predominant appearance of aberrant vacuoles in the cytosol of infected cells associated with the pronounced reduction of perinuclear dsRNA accumulation observed by fluorescence imaging. We therefore speculate that K22 interferes with the biogenesis of replicative organelles by prematurely abrogating membrane diversion functions leading to functional replicative structures. However, whereas K22 completely prevented the formation of coronavirus replicative organelles (12), K22 appeared to increase membrane proliferation and the vesicle size of ZIKV-induced replication structures. Whether this suggests either different mechanisms by which K22 interferes with the formation of functional replication complexes or the action of the same mechanism with a different outcome remains to be elucidated.",

E protein and dsRNA replication intermediates were detected using anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody (1:10; catalog number HB-112; ATCC) and anti-dsRNA J2 MAb (1:200; English and Scientific Consulting). Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-mouse IgG2a antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Alexa Fluor 633-coupled phalloidin (Invitrogen) and DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) were used to counterstain the actin cytoskeleton and nuclei, respectively. Slides were mounted in Mowiol mounting medium. For microscopy analysis, a Nikon confocal A1 microscope (Nikon AG, Egg, Switzerland) combined with an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) and digital imaging Nikon software (NIS-Elements AR, v.3.30.02) were used. Image acquisitions were performed in stacks of 0.2 \u03bcm over at least a 10-\u03bcm thickness using a 40\u00d7 objective, and sequential and not simultaneous channel acquisition was employed; in order to give high-resolution images, the acquisition setting was performed with an optimized voxel size and an automatic threshold. The images were analyzed with Imaris (v.8.0.2) software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). To avoid false-positive emissions, different settings, including those for background subtraction, threshold applications, gamma correction, and maxima, were applied.",

Thereafter, cells were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (70%, 80%, 90%, 94%, 100%, 100%, 100% [vol/vol] for 20 min each) and embedded in Epon resin, which is a mixture of Epoxy embedding medium, dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA), and methyl nadic anhydride (MNA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Ultrathin sections of 90 nm were then obtained with diamond knives (Diatome, Biel, Switzerland) on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and collected on collodion-coated 200-mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). Sections were double stained with 0.5% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate for 30 min at 40\u00b0C (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and 3% (wt/vol) lead citrate for 10 min at 20\u00b0C (Laurylab, Saint Fons, France) in Ultrastain (Leica, Vienna, Austria) and examined with a Philips CM12 TEM (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV.
