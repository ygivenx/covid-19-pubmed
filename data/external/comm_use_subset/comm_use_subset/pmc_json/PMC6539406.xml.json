            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most economically and socially devastating diseases affecting cloven-hoofed animals [1]. The infectious agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), is a member of the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family, and contains single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes of about 8,500 nucleotides [2]. As an antigenically variable virus, FMDV consists of seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia 1, and South African Territories 1, 2, and 3) and a large number of subtypes. In general, slaughtering FMDV-infected/exposed or FMDV-susceptible animals, restricting animal movement, and, in some cases, vaccinating against FMDV and then slaughtering these animals are used as control measures for potential outbreaks in disease-free areas [3]. Although inactivated FMD vaccines have been available since the early 1900s and new novel vaccines are being continuously developed, they offer little or no cross-protection against various serotypes and subtypes of FMDV. In addition, these vaccines do not provide complete clinical protection until seven days post-vaccination. Therefore, there is a need for developing effective and safe alternative antiviral strategies against FMDV [4,5,6].",

This drug could be phosphorylated by adenosine kinase and converted to mizoribine 5\u2032-monophosphate, the active form of mizoribine. It has been demonstrated that mizoribine 5\u2032-monophosphate acts as an inhibitor of inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanosine monophosphate synthetase [8]. In addition, mizoribine is known to inhibit replication of some DNA and RNA viruses, such as cytomegalovirus [9], respiratory syncytial virus [10], severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [11], bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [12], vaccinia virus [13], influenza virus types A and B, and herpesviruses, in combination with acyclovir [14,15]. However, the antiviral activity of mizoribine against FMDV has not yet been investigated. Hence, in this study, the antiviral effect of mizoribine against FMDV was evaluated in vitro using IBRS-2 cells and confirmed in vivo using suckling mice.",

However, mice treated with mizoribine showed mild histopathological changes and only a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration in the heart (Figure 7B).

By using MTS assay, the cytotoxicity of mizoribine was determined to be very weak, with a CC50 value higher than 100 \u03bcM. Furthermore, mizoribine showed significant anti-FMDV activity, not only against type O FMDV O/MY98/BY/2010 strain, but also against type A FMDV A/GD/MM/2013, with SI values of 4.67 and 15.20, respectively. These results indicated that mizoribine could be a better drug to prevent FMDV A/GD/MM/2013 infection. Moreover, qPCR and IFA findings revealed that mizoribine can significantly inhibit the viral mRNA and FMDV protein levels. To understand the preliminary antiviral mechanism of mizoribine, time-of-drug-addition assay was performed, and the results demonstrated that mizoribine mainly functions at the early stages of infection. It has been reported that the antiviral activity of mizoribine involves inhibition of IMPDH [7], an essential enzyme for the synthesis of guanosine monophosphate from inosine monophosphate through de novo pathway [8,17]. Similarly, in the present study, the antiviral activity of mizoribine against FMDV was found to be attenuated by guanosine supplementation. The animal experiment demonstrated that mizoribine had an inhibitory effect on FMDV in vivo, and treatment with 50 \u03bcg of mizoribine significantly prolonged the survival of FMDV-infected suckling mice. Although the in vivo results did not show a significant increase in the survival rates of infected mice, the delay in death and alleviated histopathological changes suggested the inhibitory effect of mizoribine on viral replication. Overall, the weak cytotoxicity and strong antiviral activities of mizoribine both in vitro and in vivo favored its further potential clinical applications in the treatment of viral infection.",

            "text": "Combination treatment strategies have been proposed to enhance the efficacy of antiviral agents, because of their advantages in overcoming viral mechanisms of resistance to antiviral treatments [18]. It has been demonstrated that mizoribine enhances the anti-caprine-herpesvirus-1 activity of acyclovir, and the combination of mizoribine and acyclovir resulted in an almost complete inhibition of viral replication. Thus, combined therapy of acyclovir and mizoribine could be exploited for the treatment of genital infection by herpesviruses [19]. Moreover, mizoribine has been reported to be active against the replication of BVDV in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, and a combination of interferons (IFNs) and mizoribine had been noted to synergistically inhibit BVDV replication in bovine kidney cells [17]. With regard to FMD, FMDV have been demonstrated to be very sensitive to IFNs, and IFN-based strategies have been established to be an efficient biotherapeutic option against FMDV [20]. Similarly, the combination of antiviral agents, such as siRNA, ribavirin, and IFNs, has been determined to produce enhanced antiviral effect against FMDV [18]. Therefore, future studies must investigate whether a combination of IFNs and mizoribine could produce increased inhibitory effect on FMDV replication both in vitro and in vivo.",
