The seropositivity of anti-HAV in individuals aged 10-19 years was 15.4% in 2005 and has increased steadily to 35.2% in 2014. Among those in their 20s, the seropositivity declined from 22.5% in 2005 to 8.7% in 2010, during the outbreak, and then rose again to 20.2% in 2014. The largest change in immunity levels was observed for individuals in their 30s; however, the seropositivity declined from around 69.6% in 2005 to 32.4% in 2014. Immunity levels also decreased in those in their 40s, from 97.9% to 79.3%, but the magnitude of the change was not as much as that for those in their 30s. Those over 50 years maintain high levels of immunity of over 98.0%. Thus, the 10-39-year age group has immunity levels of less than 40.0%, which corresponds to the birth cohorts in the 1970s and 1990s. As these cohorts age, the immunity level of Korean adults is likely to decrease [6,7]. According to the results of the 2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the seropositivity by age was 12.6% among participants in their 20s, 31.8% among those in their 30s, and 80.3% among those in their 40s, comparable to those in other reports (Table 1) [6,8].",

However, for birth cohorts from the 1970s and later, the improved level of public hygiene led to reduced hepatitis A immunity. Hepatitis A vaccination was introduced in Korea in the late 1990s and the NIP was first implemented in the 2012 birth cohorts and later, thus increasing immunity levels in these birth cohorts. However, immunity levels in the earlier 1990s birth cohorts remain low. Thus, over time, the number of naturally infected adults born before the 1960s is decreasing and the proportion of adults without naturally-acquired immunity is increasing. In the context of the 2019 outbreak, adults aged 20-49 years had the highest levels of social activities, corresponding to birth cohorts from the 1970s to 1990s; i.e., the age group with low immunity levels.",

Salted clams are a traditional Korean food; however, recently, salted clams from China are imported and distributed more than domestic ones. These shellfish may contain high concentrations of HAV and were identified as a risk factor during the 2009 outbreak [16]. This seafood is salted without being cooked and HAV can survive in salted environments [17]. HAV is inactivated only when the salinity exceeds 10% [18]. In addition, the coastal areas of China, where the hepatitis A incidence is high, are more likely to be contaminated with the virus than in Korea. A 1988 hepatitis A outbreak in Shanghai affected approximately 300,000 patients, with an incidence among those who had eaten uncooked shellfish 22.9 times that in those who had not consumed the shellfish [19].",

Although Korea\u2019s medical technology development is among the best in the world and the utilization of healthcare services and medical expenditures have increased significantly, the public health system has not correspondingly improved. Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are occurring worldwide and the threat of the importation of infectious disease and healthcare associated infection including antibiotic resistance is increasing. However, the public health system necessary to carry out effective countermeasures and the national budget allocated for public healthcare personnel and public health, in general, are inadequate. A typical consequence resulting from this vulnerability of Korea was the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2015. Since then, the system and policies for recruiting epidemic intelligence officers and managing hospital infections have been introduced; however, the speed of the implementation is slow and fundamental issues such as the development of healthcare workers, healthcare delivery system, and consolidation of the public health organization system have not changed. The current hepatitis A outbreak was predicted from the 2009 outbreak. At that time, the low immunization rates of birth cohorts in the 1970s and 1990s were identified as the cause and catch-up vaccination was recommended as the most cost-effective measure to increase immunity level of the corresponding age groups [20,21]. The actual policy was to increase the 1-year-old vaccination rate to 90% by including hepatitis A vaccination into NIP, from the approximately 50% rate as an optional vaccination. These policies were the most inefficient in modeling research. As a result, as of 2019, immunity levels in children up to age 7 have increased significantly, but the lower immunity levels in older children and adults have not been addressed. At the end of 2010, hepatitis A was designated as a class 1 notifiable infectious disease, which includes waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases, due to the need for epidemiological investigations and systematic prevention and control. However, we should review and evaluate the reported improvement in epidemiological investigations and systematic prevention and control of hepatitis A over the last decade. Although the number of waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases outbreaks has been increasing annually in locations such as group catering centers, we have focused only on the management of respiratory infectious diseases and infrastructure establishment; thus, we should review whether we have neglected the epidemiological investigation, management, and prevention of waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases. As a matter of priority, an adequate system for epidemiological investigation and countermeasures against these infectious diseases should be in place, which will require substantial improvements in our capability to perform these actions at regional and basic regional government levels.",

Children under 16 years (up to 18 years, depending on vaccine type) can receive vaccine for children that is half the cost, thus increasing group immunity of adolescents at an early age, and thus effectively contributing to the prevention of hepatitis A outbreaks [23]. Using adult vaccination in military recruits is wasteful in comparison.",

First, we should eliminate the infectious agents by identifying and isolating hepatitis A patients who are the source of viral spread.

However, the identification and isolation of every hepatitis A patient is challenging since the initial symptoms are non-specific, similar to those of the common cold; moreover, some cases are asymptomatic but can still contribute to virus spread.",

It is also important to keep your hands clean in everyday life after using the bathroom. However, this method alone cannot completely block hepatitis A outbreaks.",

        {
            "text": "Finally, the third method is to increase immunity among people at risk of infection so that they do not develop illness following exposure. Immunity can be acquired through infection at a young age (natural immunity) or vaccination (artificial immunity). Natural immunity is currently difficult to acquire in Korea and the recent implementation of mandatory infant vaccination under the NIP leaves the challenge of increasing immunity in adults [24]. However, it is practically difficult to administer the hepatitis A vaccine to all individuals. Therefore, all three policies should be deployed to prevent hepatitis A outbreaks. Which policy will be conducted as a priority will depend on the circumstances in each country. Immunization policies, in particular, depend on the hepatitis A incidence rate in each country. The World Health Organization recommends vaccination of individuals in countries with very low incidence of hepatitis A and rare outbreaks who are at high risk of hepatitis A infection (i.e., those travelling in high-prevalence regions, hemophiliacs, male homosexuals, those with illegal drug abuse, and jobs in contact with primates) [25]. In countries with a high incidence of hepatitis A, large-scale vaccination is not recommended as it will have little effect since many people tend to be infected when they are young and acquire natural immunity. However, large-scale vaccination is a cost-effective measure in countries, such as Korea, with large differences in immunity levels by age and region due to reduction in hepatitis A incidence [25]. The immunity levels are relatively low among Koreans born in the 1970s to 1990s and even lower in urban areas. In addition, the incidence, and complication and mortality rates of hepatitis A increase with age; thus, the hepatitis A fatality rate may increase in future outbreaks. Therefore, a large-scale catch-up vaccination policy is required for adults in their 20s to 40s. The hurdles to the introduction of such a policy, including securing budgets, vaccine supply, and low vaccination rates, can be overcome if with the establishment and implementation of a long-term plan of five years or more. As a short-term measure, organizations such as public health centers should provide adult vaccines at a lower cost than that of private hospitals to provide an alternative for those who are not vaccinated due to cost.",
