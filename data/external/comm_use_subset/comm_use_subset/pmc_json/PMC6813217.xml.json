            "text": "Viruses are a major threat to human health and significant efforts have been made over the last century to prevent and treat viral diseases. A huge success was the development of potent, safe and affordable viral human and veterinary vaccines using egg- and cell-based production systems (Aubrit et al., 2015; Genzel, 2015; Barrett et al., 2017; Volz and Sutter, 2017). In addition, novel approaches toward vaccination are under development, i.e., DNA and RNA vaccines (Kutzler and Weiner, 2008; De Gregorio and Rappuoli, 2014; Ahmed et al., 2017). In addition, for various viruses such as HIV, IAV, or herpes virus, potent antivirals are available for treatment [e.g., for influenza virus (Samson et al., 2013; Simonsen et al., 2018)]. Despite this, significant challenges remain. On the one hand, humans are constantly challenged by new viruses including Zika virus, MERS-coronavirus, or Ebola virus. On the other hand, most viruses change rapidly in the face of selective pressure and emergence of antiviral drug resistance is of major concern [e.g., for influenza virus (Samson et al., 2013; Lackenby et al., 2018; Shin and Seong, 2019)]. These challenges can only partly be addressed by existing technologies, since the development of new vaccines, the adaptation of existing manufacturing processes, and the identification of new antiviral targets are time consuming and costly processes. They involve complex decisions regarding the selection of efficient production systems, potency and safety aspects, and comprehensive clinical trials. Moreover, conventional antiviral measures may be too slow to save lives in case of a rapidly spreading virus.",

This concerns especially defective interfering particles (DIPs)\u2014defective viruses, which suppress the spread of their intact, replication competent counterparts, reducing infectious virus yields by up to five orders of magnitude (e.g., Akkina et al., 1984; Frensing et al., 2014). DIPs were already identified in the early fifties by studies of von Magnus (von Magnus, 1951), who performed undiluted serial passages of IAV. DIPs are characterized by deletions in the viral genome preventing the synthesis of a protein essential for viral spread (Nayak et al., 1985; Dimmock and Easton, 2015; Frensing, 2015). For replication, DIPs rely on the presence of homologous helper virus, further referred to as standard virus (STV), that supplies the missing viral protein(s) in trans. Interestingly, the presence of DIPs has been demonstrated for almost every virus studied (Huang and Baltimore, 1977) making DIPs a viable option to prevent and/or treat a larger number of viral diseases.",

It was Dimmock and colleagues (Dimmock et al., 2008) who demonstrated that the use of molecular cloning technologies enables the generation of DIPs that have the potential to protect animals from IAV infection. They also showed that the DIP isolate named DI244, from Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8; H1N1), which contains a single deletion in segment 1 (S1; coding for PB2), is suitable to both therapeutically and prophylactically protect animals from a lethal challenge by the 2009 pandemic IAV and, potentially, other respiratory viruses (Duhaut and Dimmock, 2003; Easton et al., 2011; Scott et al., 2011; Dimmock et al., 2012; Dimmock and Easton, 2014). They showed that production of the DI244 antiviral candidate can be realized in eggs followed by an ultraviolet (UV) irradiation process to destroy STV infectivity (Dimmock et al., 2008). More recently, an in vitro and in vivo antiviral effect was demonstrated for a combination of three defective interfering genes of IAV for avian and seasonal influenza using a dual-functional peptide vector (Zhao et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Despite the increasing interest in the potential use of DIPs as antiviral agents, relatively little is known regarding their spread and accumulation in cell populations. This also applies to large scale manufacturing of DIPs in biopharmaceutical industry where fertilized chicken eggs or animal cell culture technologies could be considered for efficient large scale DIP production. While eggs have been successfully used for the production of DIPs in relatively small amounts (Dimmock and Marriott, 2006; Dimmock et al., 2008), cell culture-based technologies have been less explored and have several additional advantages for large scale DIP manufacturing. Firstly, animal cells are ideal for in-depth investigation of intracellular DIP replication, their release and cell-to-cell spreading under controlled and well-defined cultivation conditions in bioreactors over an extended time period. Secondly, cells could be specifically designed for DIP generation (Ozawa et al., 2011; Bdeir et al., 2019; Yamagata et al., 2019) using plasmids for reverse genetics (Hoffmann et al., 2000), which would allow to overcome the need of any infectious helper virus for DIP replication. Such DIP preparations, in contrast to egg-based production systems, would not be contaminated with STV and would not need UV inactivation for use as antivirals (Dimmock et al., 2008). Finally, there are various quantitative assays available for detailed characterization of the dynamics of virus titers and DIP copy numbers. Together with the use of specific staining methods and flow cytometry for monitoring the progress of infection in cells (Frensing et al., 2014, 2016; Swick et al., 2014), mathematical models for DIP and STV replication can be established to describe their basic dynamics in cell culture (Frensing et al., 2013; Akpinar et al., 2016a,b; Laske et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2016).",

            "text": "In this study, following the general ideas described by Frensing et al. (2013), we investigated DIP production in a continuous cultivation system. Frensing et al. demonstrated that continuous influenza virus production in a cascade of two stirred tank bioreactors showed oscillations in virus and cell concentrations due to the presence of DIPs. In contrast to their approach using only two vessels, we used one bioreactor for continuous cell production (cell bioreactor or CB) feeding two bioreactors for virus propagation (virus bioreactor 1 or VB1; virus bioreactor 2 or VB2) operated in parallel to allow for head-to-head comparisons of virus seeds, media, cell lines, or changes in cultivation parameters under conditions as close to each other as possible. As a starting point, the impact of residence time (RT, 22 and 36 h) on DIP and STV dynamics was investigated. With regard to the establishment of manufacturing processes for DIP production, a MDCK suspension cell line growing in a fully defined medium was used (Lohr et al., 2010). Virus seeds containing known amounts of DIPs and STV were generated using a reverse genetics approach (Hoffmann et al., 2000). Cultivations were performed over a period of 20 days at two RTs to allow for at least two oscillations in STV and DIP replication dynamics (Frensing et al., 2013). For process monitoring and model development, cell concentrations, infectious and non-infectious virus titers, as well as extracellular copy numbers of S1 for both STV, i.e., full-length (FL) S1, and a known form of DIP, delS1(1), were determined. Based on the newly available quantitative data obtained for DIP and STV concentrations, the mathematical model developed by Frensing et al. (2013) was extended. After fitting, the basic process dynamics for both RTs were described well by the simulations. In particular, these simulations capture the oscillations in process variables, e.g., virus titers. In addition, the model predicts the dynamics of cell subpopulations (uninfected, DIP-only infected, STV-only infected, and co-infected cells).",

The virus was harvested 40 h post infection (p.i.), clarified by centrifugation (1,000 g) and the supernatant was aliquoted.

Additionally, virus seeds were probed for remaining plasmids after reverse genetic preparation by qPCR, which could bias reverse transcription-qPCR data of the FL and DI S1 measurements. Quantitative PCR data showed, that initial plasmid contamination was 17.6% for A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) and 0.8% for FL S1. However, from zero h p.i. on the plasmid contamination was not detectable any longer, since the virus preparation was diluted due to the low MOI applied for infection (MOI 0.1).

The first 1.5 L STR (with head space capacity for 1700 mL working volume) was used for cell propagation (CB), and the other two 0.5 L STR were run in parallel and used for virus propagation (VB1 and VB2). After inoculation with MDCK.SUS2 cells at 1.4\u00b7106 viable cells/mL, the CB was operated in batch mode the first 73 h in 1700 mL working volume (wv). Simultaneously, VB1 and VB2 were inoculated with 1.2\u00b7106 viable cells/mL and grown in batch mode in 320 mL wv and 520 mL wv, respectively. Working volumes were chosen to achieve RTs of 22 and 36 h in VB1 and VB2, respectively, using the flow rates (F) described in Figure 1 (RT = wv/F). The choice of 22 h RT was motivated by similar experiments performed previously by our group (Frensing et al., 2013). The 36 h RT was selected based on scouting experiments performed in shake flasks and preliminary mathematical simulations (not shown). The CB was maintained at 1700 mL wv. Cultivations parameters were 37 \u00b0C, pH 7.1, and a stirring speed of 130 rpm. Aeration was controlled to 30% dissolved oxygen partial pressure by pulsed addition with a mixture of air, oxygen and nitrogen through a dip tube. For infection, the DIP-containing virus seed (A/PR/8/34-delS1(1)) was added to the VB1 and VB2 at an MOI of 0.1 based on the viable cell count and the TCID50 titer of the virus seed at 50 h of culture. Additionally, the virus inoculum was supplemented with 1:100 ratio of trypsin (volume to culture volume). To avoid a fast wash-out of the virus seed, continuous mode was initiated at 23.4 h p.i. with the flow rates depicted in Figure 1. During the run, trypsin (0.5 Units/L) was present in the feed medium of the virus bioreactors. Feed media of all three reactors were provided in 5 L bottles chilled at 0-4\u00b0C; only the feed medium of the cell bioreactor had to be refilled during the run-time. Samples were taken twice a day from VB1 and VB2 and once a day from CB. About every 12 h, virus harvests reservoirs were stored at\u221220\u00b0C until further analysis. The experiment was terminated 20 days p.i. The average cell concentration input for VB1 and VB2 was 1.13\u00b7106 cells/mL as determined from the average viable cell count in CB with respect to STR working volumes and feeding rates. RTs were determined from the average volume and the average flow rate at the outlet of both STR over the infection phase.",

In brief, 10-fold series dilutions of the corresponding vRNA reference standards and RNA samples were reverse transcribed with the tagged primer Seg-1-tagRT-for (ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGCGAGCGAAAGCAGGTCAATTATATTC). Subsequently, a qPCR was performed using the Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations and the primer pairs realtime-rev (GGAATCCCCTCAGTCTTC) and vRNA-tagRealtime-for (ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGCG) for quantification of A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) and the primer pairs FL1-realtime-rev (CATTTCATCCTAAGTGCTGG) and vRNA-tagRealtime-for for quantification of FL S1. Viral RNA copy numbers were calculated based on the vRNA reference standards with linear regression. The lowest concentrations, which allowed quantification, were 2.2\u00b7106 copies/mL for A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) and 3.8\u00b7106 copies/mL for FL S1, respectively (Wasik et al., 2018). The relative standard deviation for determining copy numbers by qPCR was 23 and 27% for A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) and FL S1, respectively. Quantification of contaminating plasmids was performed by dilution series of the corresponding plasmid as described above, but without the reverse transcription step. The plasmid pHW-S1 was quantified with the primer pair FL1-realtime-rev and pHW-f (CTCACTATAGGGAGACCC). The plasmid pHW-A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) was quantified with the primer pair realtime-rev and pHW-f.",

Antiviral mechanisms, such as the interferon-mediated innate immune response, and virus-induced cell death can be triggered by the presence of intracellular viral RNAs. In our experiments, the uptake of a high number of DIPs (103-104 DIPs per cell) results in a high number of intracellular viral RNAs, comparable to levels reached during a conventional infection (e.g., Frensing et al., 2014). Therefore, and in contrast to Frensing et al. (2013) we assume that DIP-only infected cells (Id) do not continue to grow, but shut-off essential pathways for cell division, similar to the other infected cell populations Is and Ic and, thus, die due to virus-induced apoptosis with the specific rate kcdv. Note, that Cane and colleagues have shown that DIP-only infected MDCK cells can continue to grow and give rise to DIP-infected daughter cells (Cane et al., 1987). However, the experimental conditions applied in their study, i.e., the use of UV-irradiated virus seed, passaging of cells in a virus-free culture and a culture time of 5-10 days between passages, cannot be compared to the cultivation conditions of our system.",

Although in our analysis \u03bcvddiS is close to zero (see Table 1), the latter should not be ignored to allow for de novo generation of DIPs in case a DIP-free virus seed would be used for the infection of bioreactors. Co-infected cells release mainly DIPs containing the deletion in S1 (Vddi) with the specific rate \u03bcvddiC. In addition, both STV-infected and co-infected cells release non-infectious virus particles (Vd) with rates \u03bcvdS and \u03bcvdC, respectively.

The infected vessels VB1 and VB2 had a working volume of 320 mL and 520 mL, respectively. VB1 and VB2 were seeded at a similar concentration, however, they reached 1.8\u00b7106 cells/mL and 1.4\u00b7106 cells/mL at time of infection, respectively. The infection of VB1 and VB2 took place at 50 h of culture at MOI of 0.1 and left in batch mode for another 23.4 h before initiating the continuous mode (to avoid virus washout). The VB1 and VB2 vessels were operated at an RT of 22 and 36 h, respectively. Those RTs were adjusted using a constant feed of 12 mL/h of cell broth from the CB and of 5.8 mL/h fresh medium into the virus bioreactors. Furthermore (to maintain wv), 17.8 mL/h were harvested from each VBs. The average concentration of target cells transferred from the CB to both VBs Tin was 1.13\u00b7106 cells/mL. Upon parameter estimation, we simulated the cell population dynamics in the virus vessels, which showed oscillations for uninfected target cells and the various infected cell populations for both RT 22 and RT 36 h (Figure 2).",

This is linked to the simulated dynamics of the various cell populations caused by virus propagation. As expected, addition of the virus seed causes a fast increase of STV-only infected cells, followed by a strong drop in their concentration and a simultaneous increase of the co-infected cell population through superinfection by DIPs (Figures 2C,D). The co-infected cell population reaches its maxima at ~2 days p.i. and 4 days p.i., for RT 22 and 36 h, respectively. Since co-infected cells release mainly DIPs, uninfected target cells fed into the VBs will be infected by DIP only. While the DIP-only infected cell population reaches a peak concentration at ~8 days p.i. (RT 22 h) and 10 days p.i. (RT 36 h), the population of co-infected cells undergoes virus-induced apoptosis and ceases to a minimum (Figures 2C,D). However, the number of co-infected cells rises again quickly, since previously DIP-only infected cells are now superinfected by STVs produced by the small sub-population of STV-only infected cells. This behavior is repeated for another 1 to 1.5 cycles within the cultivation time. Thereby, all subpopulations of infected cells reach their peak concentrations repeatedly, which are similar in both VBs and, thus, seem independent of the RT.",

Indeed, there are qualitative and quantitative discrepancies between model simulation and measurement of the total cell concentrations. On the one hand, counting of MDCK suspension cells required the addition of trypsin for dissociation of cell aggregates, which occurred occasionally and increased the risk of outliers in cell concentration measurements. On the other hand, our model is not as well-informed on the dynamics of the various infected cell subpopulations since measurements focused on viral dynamics (see following section Viral Dynamics). To better resolve this issue, follow-up studies are planned to investigate in detail the dynamics of the various cell populations using flow cytometry. Ideally, this would not only involve the conventional monitoring of infected cells using IAV-specific antibodies (Frensing et al., 2016), but the use of fluorescence markers for specific intracellular labeling of DI RNAs, which are currently not available, but under development and will allow to distinguish co-infected from STV-only infected cells.",

For RT 22 h, titers slowly decreased to about 107 virions/mL at ~10 days p.i. For the higher RT, the decrease in titers of FL S1 virions was delayed compared to RT 22 and reached its minimum of about 108 virions/mL at ~11 days p.i. At that time, the VB with RT 22 h already reached its second peak, followed by a decrease in titers leading to a second minimum at about 16 days p.i. The second minimum for RT 36 h was reached once more about 2 days later. The concentrations of DI S1-containing virions showed an initial delay in cycles of about 4 days compared to their corresponding FL counterparts and reached their first maxima with 7.0\u00b7109 virions/mL (5 days p.i.) and 8.4\u00b7109 virions/mL (5 days p.i.) for RT 22 and 36 h, respectively (Figures 3C,D). The cyclic trend observed in both data sets is described clearly by the model fits. Note, that some quantitative discrepancies between data and model simulation remain, such as underestimation of the FL S1-containing virus titers for various time points (Figures 3A,B). Although, measured and simulated virus titers show some discrepancies for these individual runs, simulations are mainly within the error range of the assays for HA (about \u00b1 0.15 log) and TCID50 (about \u00b1 0.3 log). Regarding the error for the number of virions containing either FL or DI S1, it has to be considered that those are derived from both qPCR measurements (relative standard deviation of about 25%) and from HA titers (Equations 2 and 3). Nevertheless, further investigations (e.g., next-generation deep sequencing) should be performed to elucidate those discrepancies in more detail.",

Most likely, the higher infectious titer for the longer RT of 36 h was related to the reduced wash-out (lower dilution rate) compared to RT 22 h. In total, three cycles were observed for the short RT with a second and a third peak of ~3\u00b7106 virions/mL at 12 and 18 days p.i., respectively (Figure 4A). A similar behavior was observed for RT 36 h, however, only about 2.5 cycles were achieved during the cultivation time (Figure 4B). While the TCID50 dynamics are captured well both quantitatively and qualitatively, simulated and measured HA values deviate to a certain extent (but within the assay error range) for data points after about 10 days p.i. (Figures 4C,D). In particular, the decreasing trend of peak HA titers is not reproduced by the model (also in case the system is simulated for 90 days p.i., Data Sheet 1; Figure S1). Whether the decreasing trend of peak HA titers is an individual characteristic of these particular runs or if the model simulations still lie within the biological variation of these experiments needs to be addressed when more experiments become available. Since the overall goal of this study was to establish and fit a basic model with a minimum number of parameters and simple kinetics, we decided to keep the model structure for now. Likely, also more detailed studies regarding the dynamics of the individual cell populations will allow further improvement of the model (see discussion on Cellular dynamics).",

These maxima are similar for both RTs and correlate with the lowest TCID50 titer. We may hypothesize that one infectious STV per 105 DIPs is a critical ratio at which DIPs cause self-interference and start to hamper overall virus replication significantly. The impact of too high DIP to STV ratios and related self-interference is supported by a modeling study of our group (Laske et al., 2016). As a consequence of self-interference, DIP concentrations decrease, reaching a minimum around 11 days p.i., and numbers of infectious STVs are rising again, initiating a new cycle (see also Figures 3, 4). It would be interesting to test whether this critical ratio can be reproduced in other experiments of continuous two-stage cultivations.",

For the data set of RT 22 h, the goodness of fit was similar to the full model (Model 1), both visually (Figure 6) and quantitatively as based on the objective function values (Table 2). This was expected, since both parameters, kdvit and kvdt, were already close to zero in Model 1. For the second data set with RT 36 h, the re-fitting with Model 2 resulted in a noticeable increase of the objective function value (Table 3). In addition, Model 2 was unable to describe the data qualitatively. In particular, the number of cycles in the viral dynamics could not be reproduced any more (Figure 7). Most likely this points to an important feature of cultivations with long RTs, for which degradation and inactivation processes have to be taken explicitly into account to adequately describe the data. In contrast, in cultivations with short RTs (higher dilution rates), the overall impact of the wash-out of virions on viral dynamics was probably higher than that of inactivation and degradation processes.",

            "text": "Next, we tested whether it is essential to account for separate specific rates of infection, for either STV (kvi) or DIP infection (kvidi). For this, we used Model 1 and defined one joint infection rate (kvi in \u201cModel 3\u201d). Upon fitting Model 3 to the data of RT 22 h, the overall dynamics were still described well. However, the model overestimated the TCID50 titer while underestimating the number of FL and DI S1-containing virions as well as the overall number of virions produced (Figure 6). We observed a similar effect for the RT 36 h data set, combined with a lower number of cycles compared to the fit with Model 1 (Figure 7). This suggests that two separate infection rates are needed to achieve good agreement with experimental data. Although, visually, goodness of fit with Model 1 in both data sets seems better than that of Model 3, the objective function value has decreased only by 6% or by 19% compared to that of Model 1, for the RT 22 h (Table 2) and RT 36 h (Table 3), respectively. At a first glance, this decrease in the objective function value seems counter-intuitive, however, since Model 3 still has a very good agreement with a majority of measurements for some of the state variables, e.g., DIP concentration (Figure 7D), the objective function value might be comparable to that of Model 1. While fitting oscillating data sets, we experienced that the objective function value can be misleading for some parameter regimes and that, for instance, optimizers may also yield \u201ca good quantitative fit\u201d by a straight line through the mean of the experimental data.",

            "text": "Finally, we also tested a fourth version of the model, which consisted of a combination of Model 2 and Model 3, i.e., neglecting virus degradation processes and using a joint infection rate, simultaneously. In case of RT 22 h, the Model 4 followed the same dynamics as Model 3 (Figure 6). This was expected, since the analysis of Model 2 already showed that degradation processes are not highly relevant for RT 22 h. Thus, Model 3 and Model 4 are mechanistically identical, which also leads to similar parametrizations of these two models (Table 2). For RT 36 h, the dynamics of Model 4 were similar to Model 2, showing fewer cycles due to exclusion of virus inactivation and degradation processes (Figure 7). In addition, Model 4 showed quantitative deviations similar to those of Model 3. Together, this underlines the importance of virus inactivation and degradation processes as well as the separation of DIP and STV infection rates for RT 36 h, which have to be taken into account to capture the experimental data. Most likely the difference in kvi and kvidi is related to the underlying mass action kinetics of the model. Since the DIP concentration is, on average, about two orders of magnitude higher than the STV concentration, the model estimates a lower specific DIP infection rate to yield an adequate amount of DIP-only and co-infected cells, and a high DIP titer in the supernatant. Whether this has any biological background still needs to be addressed experimentally.",

            "text": "Ideally, models including parametrization should allow the prediction of viral dynamics for different RT, e.g., to perform model-based process optimization. However, due to some mechanisms that seem dependent on the RT (explained above) none of the current model-parameter-combinations was able to predict viral dynamics for the other RT and vice versa (see also Data Sheet 1; Figures S2, S3). Accordingly, we think that the model might still lack certain aspects or kinetics and therefore has room for further model extensions. For instance, including the eclipse phase, i.e., the time delay between virus infection and release of viral progeny, or taking into account the accumulation of other DI RNAs, except for A/PR/8/34-delS1(1), might help to further improve model fits and enable predictions (see Data Sheet 1; Figure S4).",

            "text": "In the present study, we introduce a two-stage continuous bioreactor setup for head-to-head comparison of IAV DIP production under different culture conditions. For infection, we used a virus seed generated by reverse genetics, which contained a known DIP, A/PR/8/34-delS1(1), which enabled the monitoring of DI and FL virus replication based on qPCR measurements. We observed oscillations in viral titers, where the frequency was depending on the RT. I.e., an increase in the RT from 22 to 36 h caused a shift in cycles of about 2 days. PCR analysis of IAV segments 1-3 revealed that changes in the RT might also result in the accumulation of different DIP subpopulations in long-term cultures. The mathematical model established allowed to describe the time courses of the various viral and cellular subpopulations. Comparison of model fits to the two data sets obtained suggests that for the longer RT of 36 h, inactivation of infectious STVs and degradation of virions has to be taken into account. Interestingly, the goodness of fit was also affected by the additional assumption that DIPs and STVs infect cells at different rates. Still, we observed some discrepancies between model and experimental data and found that the predictive power of the model needs improvement. This may be related to the fact that the model is still not fully informed, e.g., regarding the dynamics on the different infected cell subpopulations and the de novo synthesis and impact of other DIPs except for A/PR/8/34-delS1(1). In addition, the model might be extended further by accounting for the eclipse phase of virus release. The use of reporter viruses and specific probes for DI RNA staining may help to elucidate those mechanisms in more detail. For parameter estimation, we have used the data set of only one parallel run and are, therefore, unable to evaluate goodness of fit with respect to the biological variation of these cultivations. This will be addressed in the future, when more cultivations performed at similar experimental conditions become available.",
