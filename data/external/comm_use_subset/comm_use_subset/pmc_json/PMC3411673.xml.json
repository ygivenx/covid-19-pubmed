            "text": "Palatine tonsils and adenoids are prominent secondary lymphoepithelial organs associated with the upper respiratory tract, where inhaled antigens first come in contact with host defense cells [1]. Tonsillar hyperplasia and recurrent tonsillitis are common chronic diseases that often lead to complications that include nasal obstruction, recurrent sinusitis, snoring, auditory tube dysfunction, otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea and changes in facial growth and behavioral development [2]. These complications frequently lead to patients undergoing tonsillectomy, which still is one of the most commonly performed pediatric surgical procedures worldwide [3]. Yet, the pathogenesis of chronic tonsillar diseases is largely unknown. Tonsils and adenoids harbor bacterial and viral pathogens [4]\u2013[6], and although bacterial components of biofilms can be cultured from the surfaces and crypts of inflamed tonsils and adenoids, their role as causative agents of adenotonsillar hyperplasia is largely unknown [7].",

            "text": "Recovery of adenovirus and herpesvirus from tonsils and adenoids has been reported since the 1950s and 1960s [8], [9], but the advent of sensitive molecular methods has made it possible to detect many other viruses, including those not amenable to recovery in cell culture [4], [5], [10]\n. Nevertheless, systematic studies of viruses in adenoids and tonsils have been scarce, especially in association with chronic hypertrophic tonsillar disease. In order to investigate the role of respiratory viruses in chronic adenotonsillar diseases we have performed a cross-sectional study in surgical tissue samples and cavity washes from patients with recurrent tonsillitis and chronic adenotonsillar hyperplasia. To the best of our knowledge, this has been the most extensive study of its kind to date. The results revealed high rates of virus detection in adenotonsillar tissues, with divergent virus preponderance in different sampling sites, possibly owing to different routes of infection and/or tissue composition. The high rates of detection of respiratory viruses in adenoids and palatine tonsils of patients with chronic adenotonsillar disease bring new insights about the transmission of respiratory viruses and their role in pathogenesis of chronic adenotonsillar diseases.",

All qPCR assays were done on Thermocycler 7300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with specific primers and probes (Table S1\n). qPCR for \u03b2-actin and RNAseP housekeeping genes was done in all samples. The qPCR assays using two sets primers for different clusters of HRV types, HRSV subgroups A and B, and HCoV types OC43 and 229E, were done in duplex format. The remaining qPCR assays done with one set of primers per reaction for HAdV, HBoV, HMPV A, HMPV B, FLU A, FLU B, HPIV 1, HPIV 3, RNAseP and \u03b2-Actin were done separately.

Duplex qPCR assays were done in a final volume of 15 \u00b5L with 3 \u00b5l of cDNA, 10 \u00b5M forward and reverse primers, 5 \u00b5M probe, 7.5 \u00b5l of TaqMan master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), with the following parameters: 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 1 minute.

Moreover, the in situ hybridization signal attributed to HRV, could have been caused by persistent HEV. The specificity of our findings is supported by the TaqMan technology, which relies on the hybridization of a fluorescent probe internal to the amplicon, bringing reliability to the differentiation between HRV and HEV.

This is indirectly supported by the fact that bocaviruses of other species can persist in lymphoid tissues of the upper respiratory tract, indicating that HBoV could persist in humans in a similar way and be related to chronic inflammation of these tissues. In fact, a recent flow cytometry study has shown that HBoV can be detected in tonsillar lymphocytes in 32% of pediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy [13]. In agreement with that, the presently reported study found HBoV in nearly 24% of the adenoids, and further expanded to reveal that HBoV is more likely to be detected in in adenoids than in palatine tonsils or nasopharyngeal secretions, suggesting a preference for adenoids over palatine tonsils and thus bringing new insights to the pathogenesis of this emergent virus.",

This finds support on histological studies of enlarged tonsils, which reveals enlargement of follicles, indicating hyperplasia with marked increase in the numbers of lymphoid cells in the germinal centers [23]. On the other hand, it is possible that some respiratory viruses may directly affect tonsil cell survival, by counteracting natural mechanisms of cell death, including apoptosis. Reduction in lymphoid cell apoptosis is accepted as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy [24]\n, and that could be caused by viruses, such as the case of human coronavirus, which has a nonstructural protein that inhibits apoptosis triggered by the mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor (MAVS) [25].",

The patients were sampled only once, which hampers determination of the duration of virus presence in them. Nevertheless, significant proportions of such patients had different combinations of viruses simultaneously detected at different sites, suggesting that some of them might be persistent. It is remarkable that not all respiratory viruses were detected at similar frequencies in adenoids and palatine tonsils, nor were uniformly shed in nasopharyngeal secretions. Specific viruses seem to preferentially infect some tissues, such as human enteroviruses that were more often detected in palatine tonsils than in adenoids, and were shed in secretions much less frequently than all others. Taken together, these data suggest that respiratory virus persistence/latency may play roles in pathogenesis of chronic adenotonsillar diseases, and that these tissues may serve as inter-seasonal virus reservoirs, with possible impact in transmission in the community.",
