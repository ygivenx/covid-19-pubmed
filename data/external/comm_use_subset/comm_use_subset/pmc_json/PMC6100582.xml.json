The simplest and the best Michael acceptors are \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with exposed unsaturated \u03b2-carbon atoms, such as exomethylene ketones and lactones or vinyl ketones [1]. These fragments are often used in the design of new anticancer drugs, together with others (6-methylhept-5-ene-1,4-dione, propiolamide, 4-(dimethylamino)but-2-enamide) (Figure 1). They assure the irreversible covalent binding to a cysteine residue of a specific protein and may modulate selectivity and potency of the drug candidate. The targeted covalent modification has emerged as a validated approach to drug discovery with the drug candidate canertinib [2], approved drugs afatinib, neratinib and osimertinib (inhibitors of human epidermal growth factor receptors) and ibrutinib (Bruton\u2032s tyrosine kinase inhibitor) [3,4]. A comprehensive review published by Jackson et al. gives an overview of biological activity and applicability of various Michael acceptors [5].",

In the review published by Zhang et al., two doxorubicin prodrugs with maleimide moieties have been described [6]. The maleimide component is responsible for the binding to human serum albumin. Once the drug carrier arrives at the targeted cancer tissue, doxorubicin is released from the carrier by the cleavage of hydrazone or glycosidic bond in the acidic environment of cancer cells. The prodrugs demonstrate superior anticancer efficacy than the parent drug.",

Many of them are used in clinical practice or are still under the evaluation in clinical trials (vernolepin, helenalin, curcumin, pyrrocidine, fumaric and angelic acid derivatives), but some are classified as toxins [11]. Vernolepin and helenalin are sesquiterpenes with exomethylene lactones responsible for irreversible DNA polymerase inhibition. Pyrrocidine A is a 13-membered macrocyclic alkaloid produced by endophytic fungi, which directly binds to N-acetyl-l-cysteine methyl ester through the Michael-type addition and exerts both antimicrobial and cytostatic effect on leukemia HL60 cells [12]. Angelic acid ester ingenol mebutate has been identified as the most active component of Euphorbia peplus L. latex sap, effective against human nonmelanoma skin cancer [13] and actinic keratosis [14]. A gel formulation of ingenol mebutate has been recently approved for the treatment of actinic keratosis [15] and fumaric acid esters are used for the management of psoriasis [16,17]. Curcumin is a symmetric \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b2-diketone extracted from Curcuma longa L., a tropical Southeast Asian plant used as a spice and in traditional Indian medicine [18]. Currently, there are 17 open clinical trials involving curcumin, of which mainly evaluate the combination of curcumin with other substances used in anticancer therapy [19].",

We have chosen \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated amides because they are less electrophilic than analogous esters and better Michael acceptors [1]. Based on our previous findings [20,21], one of the amide bonds was achieved with a terminal amino group of primaquine (PQ), while the other with halogenanilines (Figure 1). Sharing the same conjugated C=C-CO system and a benzene ring, our compounds are similar to cinnamic acid (trans-3-phenyl-2-propenoic acid) derivatives as well. Taking literature data into account [22,23,24] and our previous experience with PQ derivatives [20,21,25,26,27,28], we have assumed that the designed compounds have a high pharmacological potential. Here we report their synthesis, evaluation of antimicrobial activity on a wide spectrum of bacteria, fungi and viruses, their biofilm eradication ability, and finally, cytostatic activity against several human tumor cell lines.",

To prove the significance of the conjugated Michael system for activity, we have also prepared a series of analogous compounds without a double bond, e.g., a series of succindiamides 5a\u2013f (compound 5a is a reduced derivative of 4a, 5b of 4b etc.). In both series of compounds, one of the amide bonds was achieved with the primary amino group of PQ and the other one with a selected halogenaniline. In the first reaction step, mono-ethyl fumarate (1a) and mono-methyl succinate (1b) were coupled with PQ to give derivatives 2a,b using 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU) as a coupling reagent, along with N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) [29]. However, the transformation of 1a to carboxylic acid chloride and amidation with PQ gave better yields of product 2a. Hydrolysis of 2a,b by lithium hydroxide afforded the corresponding acids 3a,b, which were again coupled with halogenanilines in the presence of HATU/DIEA. The following anilines were used: 3-fluoroaniline, 4-fluoroaniline, 3-chloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline, 3-trifluoromethylaniline and 4-trifluoromethylaniline. Scheme 1 shows the synthetic pathway leading to compounds 4 and 5.",

Two microorganisms, namely E. faecalis and S. aureus showed high susceptibility to all fumardiamides, while E. coli, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to five out of six fumardiamides. A high biofilm eradication potential of fumardiamides might be explained by the reaction of Michael acceptors with cysteine thiol, which could prevent disulfide bond formation. It is a well-known fact that cysteine homeostasis impacts biofilm formation and production of extracellular matrix components, as well as folding and stability of extracytoplasmic proteins [31]. They are also crucial for dental plaque formation, autolysis, extracellular DNA release, genetic competence, bacteriocin production and stabilization of outer membrane porin proteins [32].",

S. aureus ATCC 29213 was used as a reference and quality control strain.

Ampicillin (Amp) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as standards. Prior to testing, each strain was passaged onto nutrient agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) with 5% of bovine blood, and bacterial inocula were prepared by suspending a small portion of the bacterial colony in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2\u20137.3). The cell density was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland units using a densitometer (Densi-La-Meter, LIAP, Riga, Latvia). This inoculum was diluted to reach the final concentration of bacterial cells 5 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL in the wells. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the final concentration of DMSO in the Cation Adjusted Mueller-Hinton (CaMH) broth (Oxoid) for Staphylococci or brain-heart infusion for Enterococci did not exceed 2.5% of the total solution composition. The final concentrations of the evaluated compounds ranged from 256 to 0.008 \u03bcg/mL. The broth dilution micro-method, modified according to NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) guidelines [35] in MH broth for Staphylococcus strains and CaMH for Enterococcus strains, was used to determine MIC.

At log phase growth, a culture sample (10 mL) was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm/20 min using a bench-top centrifuge (MPW-65R, MPW Med Instruments, Poland). Following removal of the supernatant, the pellet was washed in fresh Middlebrook 7H9GC broth and re-suspended in fresh, ODAC-supplemented MB (10 mL). The turbidity was adjusted to match McFarland standard No. 1 (3 \u00d7 108 CFU) with MB broth. A further 1:20 dilution of the culture was then performed in MB broth. The antimicrobial susceptibility of M. tuberculosis was investigated in a 96-well plate format. In these experiments, sterile deionised water (300 \u00b5l) was added to all outer-perimeter wells of the plates to minimize evaporation of the medium in the test wells during incubation. Each evaluated compound (100 \u00b5L) was incubated with M. tuberculosis (100 \u00b5l). Dilutions of each compound were prepared in duplicate. For all synthesized compounds, final concentrations ranged from 1000 \u03bcg/mL to 8 \u03bcg/mL. All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and subsequent dilutions were made in supplemented MB. The plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 7 days. Following incubation, 10% of alamarBlue (Difco, Lawrence, KS, USA) was mixed into each well, and readings at 570 nm and 600 nm were taken, initially for background subtraction and subsequently after 24 h reincubation. The background subtraction is necessary for strongly coloured compounds, where the colour may interfere with the interpretation of any colour change. For non-interfering compounds, a blue colour in the well was interpreted as the absence of growth, and a pink colour was scored as growth.",

The compounds were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich), and the final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 2.5% of the total solution composition. Final concentrations of the evaluated compounds ranging from 256 \u03bcg/mL to 0.125 \u03bcg/mL were obtained by twofold serial dilution of the stock solution in a microtiter plate with sterile medium. Bacterial inocula were prepared by transferring colonies from culture to sterile water. The cell density was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland units using a densitometer (Densi-La-Meter, LIAP, Riga, Latvia). The final inoculum was made by 1:1000 dilution of the suspension with sterile water. Drug-free controls, sterility controls and controls consisted of medium and DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) alone were included.
