The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have interim recommendations on the use of facemasks and respirators for the current pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. The CDC defines the term facemask as a disposable mask cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a medical device, such as surgical masks. Surgical masks are designed to help stop droplets from being spread by the person wearing the mask, not to protect against breathing in very small particle aerosols that may contain viruses [8]. We will use of the term \u2018respirator\u2019 for an N95 or higher filtering facepiece respirator certified by the CDC/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH); a respirator is designed to protect the person wearing the mask against breathing in very small particles that may contain viruses [8]. The CDC states that the effectiveness of the use of facemasks and respirators in various settings is unknown and do not generally recommend the use of facemasks or respirators in home or community settings nor in non-medical occupational settings [8]. In certain circumstances the CDC recommends the use of masks for individuals who are at high risk of infection and cannot avoid situations with potential exposure to the disease [8].",

All three studies show similar results in penetration percentage for the N95 respirator. The high fit N95 respirator had penetration percentages from about 0.5% to 2.5% at 30 l/min and from about 0.5% to 5% at 85 l/min [9]\u2013[11]. The low fit N95 respirator had penetration percentages from about 1.5% to 3.5% at 30 l/min and from about 1.5% to 6% at 85 l/min [9]\u2013[11]. The surgical masks tested in Balazy et al.'s [10] study show a much greater penetration percentage. At 30 l/min one model of surgical mask (SM1) allowed 20\u201380% of particles to penetrate the mask, while another model (SM2) allowed 2\u201315% [10]. At 85 l/min SM1 allowed penetration of 30\u201385% of particles while SM2 allowed 5\u201321% [10]. The N95 respirator in a sealed manikin test seems to be fairly effective against nanoparticles, almost holding up to its 95% certification. The surgical masks are not as effective, allowing a much greater percentage of particles to pass through to the wearer even when sealed tightly to a manikin.",

While these studies provide data on the actual protection of masks against nanoparticles in a perfect setting, it does not take into consideration that a mask will not be completely sealed on an individual nor will it fit perfectly. Furthermore, one must consider that an individual will not always be wearing the mask, for example, a mask will be taken off to eat and sleep, or possibly because it becomes uncomfortable to wear.",

The challenge aerosol used was NaCl, with particles in the size range of bacteria and viruses (.04\u20131.3m). They tested four models of N95 respirators: 1) high protection level, 2) medium protection level, 3) exhalation valve, and 4) exhalation without valve and three models of surgical masks: 1) high protection level, 2) medium protection level, and 3) low protection level. The results from the study showed that the lowest protection offered from N95 respirators is when particles are in the size range of 0.08\u20130.2m and for surgical masks when particles are in the size range of 0.04\u20130.32m. The size range of influenza virus is in the range of 0.08\u20130.12m, which falls into both masks most penetrating particle size range. The N95 respirator was found to be 21.5% effective and the surgical mask was 2.4% effective in protecting against nanoparticles. The N95 respirator provides approximately nine times greater protection than a surgical mask and is clearly a better option in protecting against infection.",

Overall 61.2% of the respondents reported the consistent use of facemasks to prevent contracting the disease. The study found that women in the age group 50\u201359 and married respondents were more likely to wear facemasks, suggesting that the aesthetics of wearing a facemask may be a concern. Also, the study found that individuals who had a university education or earned more than US$5,000 per month were more likely to wear a mask. Tang and Wong also showed that perceived susceptibility, cues to action, and perceived benefits, were significant predictors in whether or not an individual consistently wore a mask.",
