Dr. Chen showed that Plasmodium infection reduced the replication-competent virus pool in resting CD4+ T cells (a major viral reservoir), which might be attributable to the activation and apoptosis of memory CD4+ T cells induced by malaria, with histone acetylation and NF-\u03baB activation in resting CD4+ T cells also important in this reduction. Therefore, because more HIV-1-infected individuals in malaria-endemic areas are receiving ART treatment, clinicians should determine whether some patients co-infected with Plasmodium are experiencing virological benefits (Zhan et al., 2014).

The physiological and biochemical indexes of PTMs suggested that, compared with Chinese rhesus macaques, PTMs are genetically closer to humans and thus might serve as a better NHP experimental animal (Lei et al., 2014; Lian et al., 2016; Pang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014, 2016; Zheng et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015). Based on these findings, Dr. Zheng's team inoculated PTMs with HIV-1 strains and monitored the infections for three years. The results suggest that HIV-1-infected NPMs might function as a potential NHP animal model in HIV-1 latency studies and in developing novel therapeutic strategies.",

CHIKV is a member of the Alphavirus genus. It is an important mosquito-borne human pathogen, which can cause abrupt high fever, headache, rashes, myalgia, and arthralgia, with arthritis possibly lasting for months or years. So far, however, no effective antiviral drugs or vaccines against CHIKV infection are available. Dr. Zhang's team recently isolated a CHIKV strain (GenBank Accession No. KC488650) from a clinically CHIKV-positive patient in China through serial passages in C6/36 cells, and found that it belonged to the Asian lineage of CHIKV. Using this isolated strain, an infectious clone of CHIKV and a reporter virus (eGFP-CHIKV) with an eGFP gene were constructed and used to investigate viral replication through measuring eGFP expression level. The eGFP-CHIKV reporter virus was then used to identify inhibitors and screen neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV (Deng et al., 2016).",

His group showed that adverse early-life experience, i.e., deprivation of parental relationships, can induce permanent phenotypic changes and impair the cognitive functions associated with PFC. Myelination is necessary for medial PFC (mPFC)-dependent behaviors. Blockade of oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation or lysolecithin-induced demyelination can impair mPFC functions. Histone deacetylases 1/2 (HDAC1/2) were drastically reduced in neonatal maternal separation (NMS) rats; the inhibition of HDAC1/2 promoted Wnt activation, which negatively regulated OL development, whereas, the selective inhibition of Wnt signaling by XAV939 partly rescued myelination arrestment and behavior deficiency caused by NMS. These findings indicate that, to some extent, NMS impairs mPFC cognitive functions through modulation of oligodendrogenesis and myelination (Yang et al., 2016). ",

The anteroposterior patterning of the central nervous system follows an activation/transformation model, suggesting that a prospective telencephalic fate will be activated by default during the neural induction stage, with the anterior fate transformed posteriorly per caudalization morphogens. Although both extrinsic signals and intrinsic transcription factors have been implicated in dorsoventral (DV) specification of vertebrate telencephalon, the DV patterning model remains elusive. Dr. Zhang's team assumed that human forebrain DV patterning also follows an activation/transformation paradigm. Human neuroectoderm (NE) will activate forebrain dorsal fate automatically and this default anterior dorsal fate does not depend on Wnts activation or Pax6 expression. Forced expression of Pax6 in human NE hinders its ventralization, even under sonic hedgehog (Shh) treatment, suggesting that dorsal genes repress the ventral fate. Genetic manipulation of Nkx2.1, a key gene for forebrain ventral progenitors, showed that Nkx2.1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for Shh-driven ventralization. Dr. Zhang's study proposed that Shh represses dorsal genes of human NE and subsequently transforms the primitively activated dorsal fate ventrally in a repression release manner (Chi et al., 2016).",

In their study, comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis was applied to characterize dynamics of lncRNA expression in rhesus macaque brains across postnatal development and aging. A total of 18 anatomically diverse lncRNA modules and 14 mRNA modules representing spatial, age, and sex specificities were identified. Co-expression and negative correlation between lncRNAs and mRNAs were functionally associated with brain development and aging, especially in the neocortex. These findings provide insight into spatial-, age- and sex-related dynamics of lncRNA expression during postnatal brain development and aging in macaques, implying that high dynamics of lncRNA expression might represent a previously unappreciated regulatory mechanism in shaping brain architecture and function (unpublished data).",

Jian-Hong Wang and Gong Chen (KIZ, CAS) presented recent work on the in vivo reprogramming of reactive glial cells directly into the functional neurons by single neural transcription factor NeuroD1 in the monkey brain. Stroke is a major and difficult to cure brain disorder. Clinical and experimental studies have struggled to resolve glial scars after stroke. Dr. Chen has led groundbreaking work on reprogramming reactive glial cells directly into neurons in the mouse brain with injury or AD (Guo et al., 2014), leading to a novel method to reverse glial scars to neural tissue. Dr. Chen reported on the chemical reprogramming of human astrocytes into functional neurons with a cocktail of nine small molecules. This chemical reprogramming is mediated through epigenetic silencing of glial genes and transcriptional activation of neural transcription factors such as NeuroD1 and Neurogenin 2 (Zhang et al., 2015). Dr. Chen's team have also successfully established a focal cerebral ischemia model in the rhesus monkey, and successfully expressed the NeuroD1 transcription factor in the ischemic area through infection of adeno-associated virus AAV2/9-NeuroD1. They found that NeuroD1 is expressed in the monkey's cortex and protects the brain after endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced newborn neurons in NeuroD1-infected areas, paving the way for the potential clinical application of this new technology. Implementation of this study suggests a new strategy for the treatment of stroke and other brain disorders.",

Tree shrews have a close relationship to primates and have many advantages over rodents in biomedical research. However, a lack of gene manipulation methods has hindered their wider usage. Dr. Zheng described a culture system for the long-term expansion of tree shrew spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) without the loss of stem cell properties. The expanded tree shrew SSCs were transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing lentiviral vectors. After transplantation into sterilized adult male tree shrew testes, the eGFP-tagged SSCs could restore spermatogenesis and successfully generate transgenic offspring. Thus, the development of a culture system to expand tree shrew SSCs in combination with gene editing paves the way for precise genome manipulations using the tree shrew (Li et al., 2016).",

Because such human diseases do not occur naturally in NHPs, transgenic NHPs need to be established to understand the etiology of disease pathology and pathogenesis. Compared with rodent genetic models, the generation of transgenic NHPs for human diseases is inefficient, and only a few transgenic monkey models have been reported.

The study showed tunable rescue of motor function in a mouse model of PD, following transplantation of human midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons differentiated from hPSCs engineered to express designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). Administering clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) enabled precise DREADD-dependent stimulation or inhibition of engrafted neurons, revealing D1 receptor-dependent regulation of host neuronal circuitry by engrafted cells. Transplanted cells rescued motor defects, which could be reversed or enhanced by CNO-based control of graft function, and activating engrafted cells drove behavioral changes in transplanted mice. These results highlight the ability to exogenously and noninvasively control and refine therapeutic outcomes following cell transplantation (Chen et al., 2016b). ",

Under optimized culture conditions, which were based on an approach developed previously for naive human ESCs, the cESCs displayed altered growth properties, gene expression profiles, and self-renewal signaling pathways, suggestive of an altered naive-like cell state. These findings show that it is feasible to generate chimeric monkeys using ESCs, thus opening new avenues for the use of NHP models to study both pluripotency and human disease (Chen et al., 2015).
