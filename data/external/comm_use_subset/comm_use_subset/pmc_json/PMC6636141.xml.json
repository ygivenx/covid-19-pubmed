            "text": "Young children under 5 years of age have a high incidence of hospitalization and morbidity caused by infections with common respiratory viruses. Respiratory infections are particularly high for infants who show early evidence of atopic diseases (e.g. atopic dermatitis) [1\u20133]. Epidemiologic and cross-sectional studies suggest that early life farming and animal exposures are associated with major health benefits, influencing immune development and modifying the subsequent risk of allergic diseases, including asthma [4]. Farming effects associated with decreased allergic disease include exposure to unprocessed milk (referred to as farm milk), farm animal waste and housing, and potentially bioactive substances in the farm environment [5\u201311]. In accordance with previously published studies in Western Europe, our study from central Wisconsin using interview and electronic health records (EHR) demonstrated that children raised in farming environments have a significant decrease in allergic diseases during the first 2 years of life [11\u201315]. In addition, children who live on farms in Western Europe or Wisconsin also have a marked reduction in medically-attended respiratory illnesses during the first 2 years of life compared to rural children who do not live on a farm [12, 16]. These collective findings suggest that farm-related exposures promote healthy immune system development in early life and that may lead to reduced burden of respiratory illnesses and allergic diseases. Identification and (prospective) characterization of a cohort of children that are highly protected from developing allergy disease would provide further insights and rationale in naturally-occurring environmental exposures that influence the foundational steps to prevent immune-mediated conditions.",

Participants were enrolled as a dyad, as consent was signed before birth by the mother and on behalf of the child after birth. Farm mothers were defined as those who live on, or within 1/8th mile of a farm, or who work on, or have a household member who works on a farm. Farm mothers also have regular exposure to (i.e., direct personal [or household member] contact \u2265 4 days per week) with cattle (cows, calves, bulls, steers), pigs or goats. Non-farm mothers do not live on (or within 1/8th mile of) a farm, nor work on, or have a household member who works on, a farm. Non-farm mothers also do not visit a farm weekly or more, nor have any farm livestock animals as pets (e.g., cows, goats, pigs, horses, chickens).

The initial enrollment area was confined to births at the Marshfield Medical Center in Marshfield, WI. In 2015, 24 additional ZIP codes in the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (MESA), which encompasses 10 rural medical centers throughout north-central Wisconsin, were added to increase enrollment [18, 19]. Potentially eligible patients were first mailed an informational postcard on the study, followed by an informational letter and brochure, plus an interest response card. Once eligibility information could be verified in the EHR, an invitation letter was sent (signed by their obstetrics healthcare provider), plus up to six phone call attempts. When reached for the initial phone contact, farm or non-farm categorization and exclusion factors were again verified. If all eligibility criteria were met, a face-to-face invitation and enrollment visit was arranged, typically during scheduled prenatal visits. After informed consent forms were signed during the enrollment visit, a questionnaire to gather information about health history, environmental exposures, and lifestyle was completed.",

Endpoints analyzed for this outcome include nasal swab respiratory virus detection and respiratory illness burden index. A respiratory illness is defined as at least 2 consecutive days of cold, cough, or wheeze. Nasal swabs collected at routine surveillance timepoints and during illness episodes are assayed for all common respiratory viruses (e.g. rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus and adenovirus) by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the UW study site [20]. Rhinovirus isolates are partially sequenced to identify strains and to differentiate lengthy single infections from serial infections with different rhinovirus strains. During illnesses, parents are asked to record daily information consisting of scored illness signs/symptoms and temperature measurements (if fever present) in calendar-formatted paper diaries. Illness signs/symptoms are recorded on a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) similar to previously published studies [21\u201323]. Parents or legal guardians record the data every day until symptoms resolve. The respiratory illness burden index is calculated as area under the curve (AUC) for symptom scores and days of illness. Linked EHR data is also used to capture medically-attended respiratory illnesses via diagnostic codes and/or respiratory antiviral medication prescriptions.\n",

The WISC study is also part of the recently established Children\u2019s Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW) Consortium, funded by the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. ECHO-CREW aims to harmonize data from 12 US birth cohorts focused on asthma inception, risk factors, and causal pathways. Inclusion of the WISC study cohort, the only rural and farming cohort, alongside urban, suburban, and varied geographic and race/ethnicity will provide a broader representation of US demographics.",

The findings from the WISC study will provide the first prospective, serial analysis of viral respiratory disease burden, immune development, and allergen sensitization with varied environmental exposures. This knowledge will enable development of safe and novel strategies to prevent respiratory diseases in the general population, monitor response to immunotherapies, and predict individual risk for allergic disease.",

Also, as is typical in the rural Midwest, the sample lacks racial diversity and, while adequately sized for main outcome analyses, may be small to test for effect modification in select subgroups [36]. A potential limitation of our study is the lack of air quality monitoring, particularly since ambient air pollution exposure in early life has been associated with the inception of allergic diseases and respiratory health [37\u201341]. This limitation could be overcome though accessing open source regulatory monitoring data.",
