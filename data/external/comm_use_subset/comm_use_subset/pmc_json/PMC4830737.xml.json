Researchers have validated concerns that Ohio scored lower than 43 other states in being prepared for infectious disease outbreaks (Trust in America's Health, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, news release, Dec. 17, 2015). These researchers have urged efforts to protect Americans from \u201cnew threats such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and antibiotic-resistant superbugs, along with resurging diseases such as tuberculosis, whooping cough and gonorrhea.\u201d These concerns over emergent diseases led us to review the literature of infectious diseases with adequate travel histories and to conduct a retrospective cohort study of the risk to Ohio's population including a nested case control study to explore the association between infectious disease risk and air travel. The methodological reasons for selecting malaria, seasonal influenza hospitalizations (IH), and hepatitis A (HA) among the diseases reviewed will be discussed. HA virus is highly contagious and can affect liver function. HA is transmitted frequently through contaminated food and water. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are over 1.3 million cases of acute HA every year. Influenza disease is caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory system. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, body aches, fatigue, and cough. Pneumonia can be a complication of influenza, especially in the persons with weakened immune systems. WHO estimates that over 3 million persons are hospitalized and over 250,000 persons die each year from influenza.",

            "text": "Disease transmission during air travel has been a concern for many years. Historically, the spread of nonendemic infectious disease has been linked to air travel contingent on the weather [1]. Specifically, the risk of viremic transmission has been directly related to the magnitude of viremic person-days the arriving traveler spends in the country during the season the \u201ccapable-vector\u201d is active. For example, the months the Aedes mosquito is active and able to bite viremic air travelers arriving from endemic areas would contribute to disease spread. The Aedes mosquito is found throughout the world except Antarctica. Several species are especially important to note including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The Aedes aegypti transmit several flaviviruses including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. This species cohabitates with humans so it is difficult to eradicate. The Aedes aegypti is a tropical mosquito but the range is slowing expanding to more moderate climes. The Aedes albopictus, known as the Asian Tiger mosquito, has adapted from a northern forest environment to live in suburban areas. After a blood meal females lay eggs in water. Mosquitoes transmit disease mainly by biting an infected person and having their salivary glands infected with the virus, bite a second uninfected person. Aedes albopictus can transmit chikungunya and dengue. The Ohio Department of Health reports that the Aedes aegypti is not established in Ohio but the Asian Tiger mosquito was introduced in the United States in 1985 and has spread through much of the country. With expansion of air travel networks the risk of importing diseases increases from both people and vectors readily connected to endemic malaria regions of the world [2, 3]. However, the actual public health burden of the impact of air travel on infectious disease is not known.",

Even screening of arriving passengers has not been as effective rather it has been the control measures in place and on the intensity of air travel between regions that impacted the number of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases [21]. Once a highly infectious human-to-human transmissible agent reaches the top 50 global airports, the spread around the world is unstoppable [22].

After an exhaustive literature review of air travel and infectious disease we started a practical review of what diseases of public health concern had either high virulence or incubation times that had adequate travel histories. Initially we did not automatically rule out any of the communicable diseases on the reportable list. On April 1, 2015, we developed a taxonomy to identify the diseases by symptoms, lab tests, and epidemiological links to other cases. This led us to select the diseases we felt would be of most concern. In an ascending order of incubation periods the candidate diseases were influenza, SARS, MERS, Ebola, dengue, Marburg, malaria, and mumps. Mumps and measles, both vaccine preventable diseases, dropped out as candidates due to their low occurrence among the 88 counties in Ohio, with only sporadic but important increases, would be difficult to statistically study. Ebola, SARS, and Marburg were so rare; they would also be difficult to study. Malaria, IH, and HA did have some regular occurrence and had another benefit: they each had different autochthonous presentations in the Ohio cohort, with IH being seasonal, HA mostly from endemic rather than imported by persons (although imported products could cause the disease), and malaria being almost entirely from an area where international air travel is required.",

While our initial purpose was to explore the risk of infectious diseases to air travel we first had to ask what diseases should we select to study. As noted above our taxonomy key to identify agents of concern led us to consider incubation and transmission factors. However, not only did the disease have to be of global concern there had to be an incidence of the disease in the geographic location of interest. That is, the disease had to have a sufficient number of cases to be of concern in Ohio. Also the travel histories would have had to be collected prospectively in order to be studied. This left the three diseases of interest: IH, HA, and malaria. The overall objective of the study is to determine the risk of malaria, seasonal IH, and HA disease related to international travel and to estimate the association with domestic enplanement.",

These steps included completing the CDC case surveillance report forms for malaria or viral hepatitis or the Ohio Department of Health's IH case report form. All of these forms include a travel history. Cases were classified as confirmed or suspected. For IH only two classes exist: confirmed or not a case. For a hospitalized person with clinical symptoms consistent with influenza to be classified as confirmed rather than suspect, they had to be laboratory confirmed or be epidemiology linked to a confirmed case. HA classification includes a suspect classification and confirmed or not a case. Malaria has two case classifications of suspected (detection of Plasmodium species by rapid diagnostic testing) or confirmed by microscopy. Field methods also included contacting the state public health agency immediately if a case of malaria had no recent history of overseas travel as this may mean that local transmission from infected person to vector to person has occurred. For influenza, public health management includes reminders to physicians not to use aspirin to treatment infants, children, or teenagers because of the risk of Reye syndrome. The use of antivirals can be started within the first two days of illness to reduce the severity and shorten the duration but this depends on the susceptibility of the virus to specific antiviral medications. Isolation is usually impractical for influenza. For HA, public health management includes exclusion of cases from food service or child care occupations for 10 days after initial onset of symptoms. If there is an outbreak of HA postexposure prophylaxis of immune globulin or HA vaccine should be considered for all previously unvaccinated close personal contacts, common source exposures.",

While this may lead to slightly underestimating the number of exposed controls the assumption that passports issued correlate with international travel is based upon the presumption that the costs related to passports rule out most of those who obtain passports for nontravel reasons and that any error would be minimized by the long time span of the study. Further, US passports for persons aged 16 and older are valid for 10 years. We considered US passports issuance as if they were issued without replacement, counting all the passports issued during the study period as representative for the entire population at the study midpoint. The number of enplanements based on boarding to estimate the number of domestic travelers is subject to several biases. Some air travelers enplane even on the same flight more than once and may change conveyance types more than once on the same trip. Domestic travel based on enplanements including international travelers and postarrival from international ports of entry to their final destination would increase the number of enplanements for those passengers. An assumption that international travel was mostly by air would decrease the number of travelers from endemic areas as some come by sea. Histories only provided one country visited; although this information may have appeared in the notes section it was not feasible to extract the notes in the time allotted for this study.

The number of controls in the population at large was corrected for by the number of cases with reported international or domestic travel (for HA domestic travel was obtained by history). The number of enplaned passengers in Ohio for all airports was retrieved from publicly available Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data for passenger boarding from the Air Carrier Activity Information System (ACAIS) from calendar year 2012. This year was chosen as it was the temporal study midyear. The Greater Cincinnati Airport which is in Northern Kentucky was also included. The rate of enplanement was assigned as high if there were more than 40,000 passengers per year. The assignment of the rate of annual enplanement was done using the largest natural breakpoint in histogram of total airport enplanements. The airports with the enplanements higher than 40,000 annual included Cleveland-Hopkins International, Port Columbus International, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International, James M. Cox Dayton International, Akron-Canton Regional, Toledo Express, and Youngstown-Warren Regional. Since Ohio counties are of similar size, high density metropolitan areas were designated as counties in Ohio with a population of over 300,000 including Butler, Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton, Lorain, Lucas, Montgomery, Stark, and Summit. Counties with the largest number of enplanements included Butler, Clermont, Cuyahoga, Delaware, Franklin, Greene, Hamilton, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Montgomery, Stark, and Summit. The county of residence was used to match the controls to exposure while for cases the county of residence was obtained by history. The population used for Ohio was the midpoint of the study as retrieved from the US Census. Air Travel was defined by the number of passengers enplaned by airport and by proximity of total population to airport. The rationale for using enplanement and an indicator for international air travel (the number of US passports issued) was to differentiate between international and domestic flights and the effect on endemic, autochthonous, and nonendemic disease.",

Given our rationale for using enplanement as an indicator for domestic travel in the controls and a negative history of travel through case interviews, high enplanement captures international air travelers as well as domestic travel. Low enplanement areas represent mostly regional and domestic flights. A likely scenario is that the students, families, and friends the traveler visits in the countries shown in Figure 1 suggest a traveler who has come to an area with high enplanement such as a major metropolitan area for business or education. One could hypothesize a younger adult, a risk taker traveling around the world and perhaps being in areas where mosquitoes could prevail. The longer potential incubation time for malaria of well over a month would suggest that a percentage of persons traveling from endemic areas are going to come down with malaria. Why would international travel be protective for HA and influenza? The vaccine preventable disease of influenza would be a requirement for entry into the United States.

Passengers with nonendemic diseases should alert health officials once they arrive to their destination. People who want to travel to regions with certain endemic diseases should make sure their vaccinations are up to date and all the necessary prophylaxis and other precautions are complete prior to departure. Coordination with other agencies to ensure tracking of returning passengers should be strengthened through existing coordinating agencies. Specifically, more resources should be provided to CDC's Division of Global Health Protection at this component of the CDC's Center for Global Health works with ministries of health and other partners to protect the health and improve the well-being of people globally by building public health capacity to prevent disease, disability, and death from communicable and noncommunicable diseases.

The alternative is to closely monitor suspected passengers and making sure that all passengers going to hot zones take all the extreme precautions. However, air traveler screening is ineffective for diseases with long incubations and inaccurate reporting by travelers [34]. Screening could be improved by customizing screening to the suspect agent. The current Ebola outbreak has killed 8,626 people as of January 18, 2015. In our personal communications with colleagues in West Africa the statement was made that \u201cEbola may rise again in Montserrado complacent that Ebola has passed in desire to return to the old ways only to bring death.\u201d The World Health Organization proposes Ebola reform includes a \u201cdedicated contingency fund to support rapid responses to outbreaks [35].\u201d",
