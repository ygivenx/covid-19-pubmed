Only the first swab taken from individual patient was included. Swabs were routinely taken from patients in two departments, while in another one sampling was sparse. High season and low season of incidence were also included as variables. The seasons were previously determined with cluster analysis of the demographic structure of children diagnosed with bronchiolitis in the period from 2010 to 2013 as reported by the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH). According to the data from the NIPH, in 2014/2015, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasonal epidemic in the Republic of Slovenia started in November, peaked in December and ended in February.11 Viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), and all samples were tested for the presence of RSV, hMPV, HBoV, HRV, PIV, InfV (A and B), HCoV, EV and AdV.12 Using rRT\u2010PCR, the sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal swab is above 90% compared to a composite gold standard.13, 14 For 288 patients, no swab analysis was performed.",

Its retrospective design has limited our ability to review additional information about other possible risk factors, for example Apgar score, smoking exposure, maternal age, presence of preschool\u2010aged siblings, siblings attending day care and patient attending day care.16, 40 Also, nasopharyngeal swabs were not taken in all patients due to the policy of one of the departments not to routinely sample all bronchiolitis patients. Viral diagnosis was done on 62% of children, which could be a limitation to result interpretation. In addition, children with performed viral diagnosis were younger and were treated in the high seasonal months. Comparison of the three groups regarding virus repartition should be taken with precaution as the sample of children treated in the standard hospital setting with viral data available seems to be biased. Data are not missing at random, but are available to higher extent for younger children and for children treated in the high season months.",
