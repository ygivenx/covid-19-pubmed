In 2010, a novel RSV-A genotype ON1 characterized by a nucleotide (nt) duplication of 72-nt in the G protein gene, appeared in Ontario (Canada) [9]. A similar 60-nt duplication in the G protein gene of RSV-B genotype BA had previously been associated with rapid spread and replacement of other genotypes [10], indicating selection advantages of such nt-duplications [11, 12]. Correspondingly, it has been suggested that the new RSV-A ON1 may have the potential to replace other (non-ON1) RSV-A strains [2, 11, 13].",

The assay does not discriminate between RSV-A and RSV-B. For RSV subtyping and genotyping, the second variable region of the G protein gene was amplified by RT-PCR using primers described by Peret et al. [7]. PCR fragments were sequenced in both directions using Big Dye terminator v3.1 chemistry and the ABI Prism 3130xl (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). RSV genotypes were assigned after alignment with reference sequences and subsequent phylogenetic analysis using MEGA software (Version MEGA 7.0.26). For this purpose, the best-fit nucleotide substitution model was calculated. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood algorithm and the General time-reversible model with a gamma distribution of 5. To test the tree stability, bootstrap values of 1,000 were used.",

It has been speculated that the rapid spread of RSV-A ON1 might also reduce RSV-B circulation in subsequent seasons [43, 44]. In our study, however, RSV-B strongly dominated the seasons 2013/14 and 2015/16. This finding suggests that the emergence of genotype ON1 has not had a noticeable effect on the overall epidemiological pattern of frequent shifts between RSV-A and RSV-B group dominance [2, 3], confirming similar observations reported from Spain [38] and Argentina [43].",

The mechanisms for the selective advantage of such nt-duplications are still poorly understood and may be associated with effects on virus replication fitness [46], or on the modulation or evasion of host immune response and host adaptation [3, 19]. It will be interesting to observe for how long these two genotypes remain predominant. For RSV-B genotype BA, first detected in 1999 [10], a considerable number of sub-genotypes based on point mutations are already known [3]. For RSV-A ON1, several new lineages have recently emerged [13], including the extreme case of a complete loss of the nt-duplication which has been observed under specific conditions, e.g. a lack of host\u2019s immune system driven selective pressure [47]. The future evolution of these two most prevalent genotypes and the underlying selection mechanisms may have a considerable impact on the development of potential RSV vaccines [19].",

In contrast, three studies reported a milder course of illness associated with genotype ON1, such as a lower severity score [32], a lower rate of bronchopneumonia / lower respiratory tract disease [33, 35] and a lower hospitalization rate [33]. These controversial observations might be explained by the heterogeneity of study designs, inclusion criteria, region, and the seasons/years when the surveillance was undertaken, resulting in different levels of genotype-specific herd immunity [2, 19, 44].",

Furthermore, a study from Italy covering the first two years of genotype ON1 emergence [35] and also our own observations from the season 2011/12, the first year of genotype ON1 appearance in Germany [14], had suggested a higher rate of PICU admissions for RSV-A ON1 patients. However, our previous assumption was based solely on laboratory samples; clinical data to adjust for other factors with a potential impact on PICU admission was not available at that time [14]. The inter-setting analysis presented here was based on both laboratory and clinical data for a larger and more homogenous subgroup of PW and PICU patients admitted during the first two seasons of RSV-A ON1 emergence. In this analysis, we found no association of genotype ON1 with PICU treatment after adjustment for season, demographic and anamnestic characteristics. Furthermore, only very few of our within-setting comparisons pointed to a more severe clinical course of RSV-A ON1 during the early phase of ON1 circulation compared to later seasons, e.g. an increased refusal to feed in PW patients and longer CPAP treatment in PICU patients. Our study therefore showed no indication of a notably higher virulence of RSV-A ON1 during the first season(s) after its initial emergence.",

The majority of children in this setting were younger than 6 months of age (median age two months), and likely experienced their first-ever RSV infection. RSV-A NA1 was the most prevalent RSV-A genotype in the population before the emergence of genotype ON1 and, hence, it might be speculated that maternal RSV-neutralizing antibodies transferred to the child before birth [48] were mainly directed against the NA1 genotype. As the mean half-life of RSV-neutralizing antibodies has been estimated as 26 days, it seems plausible that they may have provided at least partial immunity against the NA1 genotype during the first few months of life [48\u201350], but no or only very limited protection against the new ON1 genotype [51].",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. The data for the present analyses was obtained within the framework of several ongoing surveillance studies, each targeting clinical severity of respiratory viruses in a specific pediatric setting. Hence, although all studies included children with PCR-confirmed, RSV-associated RTI and enabled extensive within-setting comparisons, the scope for inter-setting comparison was limited, mainly due to the differences in design, study seasons, and patient age range. Even in a subgroup corrected for study seasons and age range, the results of the inter-setting comparison PW vs. PICU should still be regarded with caution, as the children from PW and from PICU pooled for this analysis belonged to different study populations, with only one hospital contributing to the PW dataset. Hence, regional factors, such as possible differences in the distribution of RSV-A genotypes, cannot be ruled out, which may lead to confounding of the association. Furthermore, some subgroup analyses within settings were limited by the small sample size, e.g. the comparison of RSV-A genotypes in the subgroup of PICU children with premature birth. However, the higher clinical severity of genotype ON1 found in patients within the PICU setting was indicated by several markers of severity, both overall and in stratified analyses, and, thus, appears to be a robust finding. Apart from small sample size, the less pronounced difference among RSV-A genotypes observed in PICU children with premature birth might be due to the fact that the general higher risk for a more severe course of RSV disease of these children has a stronger impact than variations in the RSV genotype.",
