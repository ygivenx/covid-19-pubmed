Just a day earlier, on 30 December, ProMED-mail published a post calling for more information about \u2018A cluster of undiagnosed pneumonia - China (Hubei)\u2019. The post indicated that there had been some 20 patients diagnosed with \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019 with seven of them being severely ill [1]. In their accompanying note, the post\u2019s moderator stated \u2018the type of social media activity that is now surrounding this event,\nis very reminiscent of the original \u201crumors\" that accompanied the SARS-CoV outbreak.\u2019 [Ed. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak in 2003].",

Meanwhile, on 7 January 2020, the novel coronavirus, currently named 2019-nCoV, was officially announced as the causative agent by Chinese authorities [3]. In order to support public health action, viral genome sequences were released by Chinese researchers on 10 January [4] and 2 days later, four further sequences were also made available on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/).",

One is a research article by Corman et al. on the development of a diagnostic methodology based on RT-PCR of the E and RdRp genes, without the need for virus material; the assays were validated in five international laboratories [5]. Before this publication, a description of the assays had already been made publically available on a dedicated WHO webpage [6] to support rapid development of laboratory testing capacities. The other is a rapid communication where researchers based in Hong Kong report on their attempt to estimate the severity among hospitalised cases of 2019-nCoV infection through modelling based on publically available information, mainly from Wuhan health authorities [7]. It also points out the need for more detailed information to make an informed evaluation of the situation as basis for public health decision-making.",
