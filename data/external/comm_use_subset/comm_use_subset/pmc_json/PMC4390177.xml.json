This demyelinating process has been associated with nitrosative stress in vivo and in vitro [3, 4], glial-microglial activation and lymphocyte migration [4], and an increase in lipoperoxidation, caspase-3 activation, and cell death in vivo [5]. The taiep rat has been considered as a chronic animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS) [6], which is characterized by a remyelination failure in areas of chronic demyelination with absence of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and acute inflammation [7]. It has been suggested that astrogliosis in a microenvironment of chronic inflammation forms a barrier that impedes the OPC migration [7]. However, induction of an acute inflammation in areas of chronic demyelination can activate remyelination as proven in the taiep rat [8]. These results suggest that OPCs in the taiep rat are unable to generate myelinating oligodendrocytes due to the lack of the stimulatory factors and/or the presence of inhibitory factors [8].",

To date, the immunological mediators involved in those differential cell processes in the taiep rat remain unknown. Several reports in different animal models [10\u201315] and in human patients with MS [16] sustain the involvement of chemokines and their receptors in the CNS inflammation. Alternatively, chemokines also participate in myelin development. CXCL1 has been shown to play an important role in proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation of oligodendroglial cells and myelin synthesis [17\u201319]. Moreover, the deficit of CXCL1 and CXCR2 causes failure in the myelination process due to an aberrant migration of OPCs in the spinal cord white matter [20]. CXCL12 activating CXCR4 receptor has been involved in the OPCs maturation and remyelination failure [21]. CXCL12 also acts as a growth factor for stimulating the astrocyte proliferation and neuronal cells [22, 23], via extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1/2) [24].",

The present work aimed to evaluate whether a deregulation of chemokine expression profile occurs in the taiep rat. We used RT2 Gene Profiler PCR Array to assess cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors and ELISA to measure CCL2, CCR2, CCL5, CCR5, CXCL1, CXCR2, and CXCR4. The measurements were made in the brainstem from 1- to 6-month-old taiep rats because this is the second region most affected and presents atypical cells at those ages [4]. The results were compared with those in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Our results showed the deficiency of CXCL1 and CXCR4 levels in the taiep rats, suggesting that these chemokines might be involved in the remyelination failure in those animals.",

The protein content was determined using the method by Sedmak and Grossberg [25]. Aliquots containing 5 \u03bcg of total protein were placed into wells of ELISA plates to determine chemokines and receptors in separate assay. Then, proteins were denatured by the addition of 100 \u03bcL of 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 8.0) added into each well and the plate was incubated for 18 h at 4\u00b0C. To block nonspecific binding sites, 200 \u03bcL of 0.5% bovine serum albumin, IgG-free, was added to each well at room temperature (RT). After 30 min of incubation, the wells were washed thrice with PBS-Tween 20 (0.1%). Rabbit monoclonal antibodies to CCL2, CCR1, CCR2, CCL5, CCR5, CCR8, CXCL1, CXCR2, CXCR4, FGF2, and VEGFA (1 : 500 dilution, Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) detect both native and denatured proteins. They were added into each well and incubated for 2 h at RT. After three washings with PBS, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 1000 dilution, Dako North America Inc., Carpinteria, CA, USA) was added and incubated for 2 h at RT. The antigen-antibody complex was revealed by adding 100 \u03bcL of 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) containing 0.3% H2O2 into each well. After 15 min, the optical density (OD) was determined at 415 nm using a Benchmark multiplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) as was described elsewhere [4].",

In normal pups, the exposure to stress stimuli leads to decreased levels of IL-10 and IL-1\u03b2 in serum [26]. Downregulation of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 in the brainstem of taiep rats might be explained in part by the motor alterations of taiep mother and pups, acting as a stress stimulus. In addition, downregulation of TGF-\u03b21 was found in taiep rats. As TGF-\u03b21 suppresses inflammation and promotes neuronal survival in adult CNS, the lack of these effects could be associated with the increased neuronal apoptosis and necrosis in the brain of adult taiep rats [5]. The decrease in TGF-\u03b21 expression at 6-month-old taiep and SD rats might also be a sign of CNS aging.",

Accordingly, inhibition of GPR17 expression causes impairment in oligodendrocytes differentiation and myelination in in vivo and in vitro systems [28]. Supporting this, GPR17 downregulation could contribute to alterations in remyelination in the taiep rats. Another coupled protein receptor that was downregulated in the brainstem of 1-month-old taiep rats was FPR1 (formyl peptide receptor 1), which mediates the chemotaxis, activation, and cytokine gene transcription in phagocytic leucocytes in response to bacterial formylated chemotactic peptides [29].

Lack of CXCL1 may also contribute to differentiation failure of OPCs [39, 40]. Altogether, these alterations of OPCs limit the remyelination in the taiep rats. On the contrary, the increased CXCL1 mRNA and protein levels in other myelin mutants such as jimpy mice were associated with a remyelination process in the spinal cord [41]. However, CXCL1 mRNA was not affected in the taiep rats; the decrease of CXCL1 protein levels could be explained by instability of mRNA or a failure in its regulation. Related to the former suggestion, it has been reported that CXCL1 mRNAs contain adenine-uridine-rich sequence elements (AREs) in their 3\u2032-untranslated regions (3\u2032-UTRs) that exhibit constitutive instability. These regions are stabilized by acute proinflammatory stimulus, that is, IL-17 [42\u201344], that is not present in the taiep rats.",

This factor released by astrocytes is known to disrupt the blood-brain barrier in CNS inflammatory disease [48]. In addition, VEGF promotes OPC migration to the myelination areas [49]. However, OPC migration is altered in taiep rats [7, 8] despite the increased VEGF levels. The alteration of OPC migration might be explained by the deficiency of CXL1 and CXCR4 found here. The role of VEGF in OPCs migration was proven by blocking VEGF receptor with anti-Flk-1 antibody [49]. Finally, the increased levels of VEGF, CXCL10, and CCL19 might account for the infiltration of lymphocytes CD4+ and CD8+ previously found in the taiep rats at the age of 6 months.",
