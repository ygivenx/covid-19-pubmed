            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), particularly pneumonia, are among the leading causes of mortality in children under 5 years of age worldwide (Liu et al. 2015:430\u2013440). Respiratory disease may cause increased volume and viscosity of pulmonary secretions, ciliary dyskinaesia and ineffective cough, which may impair pulmonary secretion clearance with subsequent sequelae related to airway obstruction (Fink 2007:1210\u20131221). Physiotherapists can facilitate airway clearance using techniques that mobilise pulmonary secretions, known as airway clearance therapy (ACT) (Morrow 2019:1\u201312). These techniques can be passive techniques, performed manually by the therapist (e.g. positioning, percussions and vibrations), or active techniques requiring cooperation (e.g. the active cycle of breathing technique, autogenic drainage and positive expiratory pressure techniques) (Morrow 2019:1\u201312). Although ACT may be used in the clinical management of children with LRTIs, there is a lack of evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of ACT in this population. In children hospitalised with pneumonia, contradicting results have been found regarding the effectiveness of ACT in this population (Abdelbasset & Elnegamy 2015:219\u2013226; Corten et al. 2018:e1690; Corten, Jelsma & Morrow 2015:256; Lukrafka, Fuchs & Fischer 2012:967\u2013971; Moura Da Silva et al. 2015:eS1052\u2013eS1053; Paludo et al. 2008:791\u2013794). In children hospitalised with bronchiolitis, however, it is agreed that ACT should not be routinely applied (Caffrey Osvald & Clarke 2015:1\u20133; Figuls et al. 2016:CD004873). A recently published state-of-the-art review concluded that ACT should not be performed routinely in children with LRTI but rather treatment should be prescribed on an individualised basis following clinical assessment (Morrow 2019:1\u201312).",

More viral than bacterial organisms were isolated. This confirms the results of a previous South African study, where human rhinovirus, RSV and adenovirus were most often identified in children with LRTI (White et al. 2016:443\u2013445). Hasan et al. (2014:e45\u2013e52) reported that RSV was the most common viral agent, followed by rhinovirus. This is the same as our results, albeit in different proportions (19.5% and 18.7%, respectively, in Hasan et al.\u2019s report compared to 44.1% and 38.0% here). A study conducted on Turkish children with viral LRTI also reported RSV as the main pathogen (55.6%) in children younger than 1 year of age, followed by parainfluenza, which was the most common viral isolate in older children (Hatipoglu et al. 2011:508\u2013516). We found Mycobacterium tuberculosis to be the most common bacterial organism (4.9%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.5%). Another South African study reported Acinetobacter baumannii as the most common bacterial organism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (20.6%) (Ghani et al. 2012:e275\u2013e281). Although our rate for Klebsiella pneumoniae identification was similar to that reported by Hasan et al. (2014:e45\u2013e52) (4.1%), it was only the seventh most common bacterial agent in the latter study. Our study is limited by the low rate of available sputum/blood cultures, with no standardisation of sampling, potentially overestimating the proportions of some organisms whilst missing others.",

Owing to the observation of desaturation during ACT, monitoring of peripheral oxygen saturation is recommended during the performance of ACT. A study on the use of ACT in children with bronchiolitis mentioned that no adverse events occurred; however, it is unclear as to which adverse events were under consideration (Postiaux et al. 2011:989\u2013994).

In a study conducted by Rodriguez et al. (2014:269\u2013276), predictors for disease severity in children with RSV LRTI, partially based on length of hospital stay, were aged younger than 6 months, born prematurely, with a pre-existing lung disease or congenital cardiac disease. Our finding that receiving ACT was associated with increased duration of hospital stay may reflect the increased likelihood of receiving ACT in those who developed nosocomial infections (Green et al. 2015:305\u2013312).",

In our study, the overall mortality rate for children with an LRTI was low; however, a greater proportion of children with presumed nosocomial infection (5.7%) died. The mortality rate for children with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia was 0.6%. These mortality rates, although slightly higher, are comparable to the rates found in children younger than 5 years hospitalised with acute LRTI in rural Thailand, with 0.3% overall mortality rate (Hasan et al. 2014:e45\u2013e52). All children included in our study, who died during the study period, presented with multiple comorbidities and seven of the 10 children were older than 4 years of age. The cause of death could therefore be multifactorial and not solely attributed to LRTI. Airway clearance therapy was associated with an increased mortality rate, which has not been previously reported. However, causality cannot be determined on the basis of this study design. Considering most children admitted with pneumonia had comorbidities, this may explain the higher mortality observed in this group.",

It is therefore recommended that more research regarding ACT in children with nosocomial infections and pneumonia be conducted.
