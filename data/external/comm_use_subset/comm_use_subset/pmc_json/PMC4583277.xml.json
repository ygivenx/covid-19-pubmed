In South Africa, polyphenol-rich herbal preparations made up from roots of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme are traditionally used to treat respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, dysmenorrhea, and hepatic disorders [1]. Inspired by the healing of his tuberculosis, Charles Henry Stevens introduced this phytomedical drug to England already in 1897 [1]. More than seven decades later, a special ethanolic extract of Pelargonium sidoides roots, EPs 7630, was finally developed [EPs\u00ae 7630 is the active ingredient of the herbal medicinal product Umckaloabo\u00ae (ISO Arzneimittel, Ettlingen, Germany)]. In Germany, EPs 7630 is approved today for the therapeutic use in patients with acute bronchitis. In addition, EPs 7630 was shown to be effective in clinical trials with patients suffering from tonsillopharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, common cold or COPD [2\u20136]. As an alternative to antibiotic treatments, EPs 7630 has the advantage of not promoting microbial resistances [7]. The latter aspect is mainly explained by its characteristic not to interfere with the metabolism of viruses or bacteria.",

            "text": "Although the research of the last years has made substantial progress with respect to the broad antiviral and antibacterial efficacy of EPs 7630, the exact mode of action of EPs 7630 is not fully understood yet. In vitro, EPs 7630 shows efficacy against cellular infections with influenza virus, HSV, EMCV, RSV, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and coxsackie virus, and this appears to be mainly mediated indirectly by inhibition of virus attachment and spreading [7, 10\u201313]. Different modes of action underlying the antibacterial effects of EPs 7630 have been proposed. EPs 7630 inhibits the adherence of bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Helicobacter pylori to epithelial cells in vitro [14\u201318]. Furthermore, ciliated cells isolated from the nasal epithelium enhanced their ciliary beat frequency in the presence of EPs 7630, which should allow a better removal of excess mucus and bacteria [19]. Regarding the infection with Candida albicans, EPs 7630 was shown to enhance the oxidative burst and intracellular pathogen killing by human blood phagocytes [15]. In Leishmania major-infected murine macrophages, EPs 7630 increased cellular nitric oxide production and mRNA levels of iNOS and several cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) [13, 20\u201322]. However, our knowledge regarding the influence of Pelargonium extract on human immune cells, in particular on their cytokine production, is still highly restricted. To gain insight into this matter we comprehensively studied the immunoregulatory effects of EPs 7630 on human blood immune cells.",

In the first setting, PBMCs were stimulated with EPs 7630 (3 and 30 \u03bcg/ml), Escherichia coli 0127:B8 lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 ligand; 100 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C); 10 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich], a cytokine mixture of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 and IL-12 (10 ng/ml each; R&D systems), anti-CD3 (Orthoclone; Cilag) and anti-CD28 (R&D systems) monoclonal antibodies (1 \u03bcg/ml each), or were left without specific treatment (0.1% ethanol as solvent control) for 4 and 24 h, before cell culture supernatant was recovered for ELISA cytokine production analysis. In another setting, PBMCs, after serum-starvation for 3.5 h, were stimulated with the same stimuli (for TCR stimulation CD3/28 coated Dynabeads were used at a cell / bead ratio of 2:1) but for 10 and 30 min, and cells were recovered for western blot analysis. For EPs 7630 dose-response analyses of cytokine production, isolated PBMCs were stimulated with EPs 7630 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 \u03bcg/ml or were left without stimulation (0.1% ethanol control) for 48 h. In some of these concentration-response analyses, lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml) or poly (I:C) (10 \u03bcg/ml) was added after the first 24 h and incubation was continued for a further 24 h. To study the kinetics of cytokine production, isolated PBMCs were stimulated with 10 \u03bcg/ml EPs 7630 or 0.1% ethanol (solvent control) for 4 to 72h. For intracellular TNF-\u03b1 analysis, PBMCs were stimulated for 4 to 5 h with EPs 7630 concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 \u03bcg/ml, with 0.1% ethanol solvent control and, if indicated, 25 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/1 \u03bcg/ml ionomycin before being prepared for flow-cytometry-based cytokine analysis. In some of these studies, PBMCs were pretreated with SP600125, PD98059, wedelolactone (all from Sigma Aldrich) and SB202190 (Invivogen) at 10 \u03bcM each or with 0.1% DMSO (solvent control, Sigma Aldrich) for 45 min before EPs 7630 (10 and 30 \u03bcg/ml only) application. The possible influence of EPs 7630 on PBMC proliferation and apoptosis was tested by stimulation of PBMCs with 0 (0.1% ethanol solvent control), 3, 10 and 30 \u03bcg/ml EPs 7630 as well as with 1% DMSO (positive control for apoptosis induction) for 24 h.

So far, data regarding its target cells and effects thereof within the human immune system are lacking. To address this issue, we first investigated whether EPs 7630 influences resting human immune cells. Therefore, PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were treated or not (control) with EPs 7630 at two concentrations and were tested for cytokine production. As a comparison, these cells were also stimulated with toll-like receptor (TLR)3 [poly(I:C)] and TLR4 ligands (bacterial lipopolysaccharide), which mainly act on antigen-presenting cells (e.g., monocytes) and mimic viral and bacterial infection, respectively. As further positive controls a mix of cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-12), able to activate NK-cells, as well as T-cell activating anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies, were used. Interestingly, cells responded to EPs 7630 by secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 with levels that were much higher than those induced by the mix of cytokines and TCR engagement (Fig 1A). Furthermore EPs 7630 slightly triggered IL-10 production, and this production was clearly smaller (~3- to 5-fold) than that induced by CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation. Importantly, the cytokine profile induced by EPs 7630 in PBMCs was also different from that induced by TLR3 or TLR4 ligands (Fig 1A). In fact, the EPs 7630-induced response was much more pro-inflammatory than that induced by the viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents (Fig 1B). As no relevant cytotoxicity or influence on PBMC proliferation were observed by EPs 7630, the cytokine increase provoked by EPs 7630 seems to be due to an induced production rate (S1 Fig).",

Additionally, a kinetic analysis of EPs 7630-dependent cytokine production by PBMCs revealed, that especially TNF-\u03b1 is produced very quickly (Fig 1D). Afterwards, the TNF-\u03b1 level continuously decline, probably as a result of binding and internalization of this cytokine by monocytes.

Surprisingly, no relevant TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or IL-10 production was found by these cells stimulated with different EPs 7630 concentrations (Fig 2A). In the next step, we tested whether EPs 7630 might modulate the cytokine response in activated memory T helper cells. However, CD3/CD28 stimulation of these cells, pretreated with different doses of EPs 7630, did not result in a relevant increase of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or IL-10 secretion (Fig 2B). Moreover, flow-cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokine staining showed that no population of T helper cells was able to produce TNF-\u03b1 after stimulation with EPs 7630, whereas they strongly responded to PMA/ionomycin activation (Fig 2C and S2 Fig).

Because of the cytokine profile observed after PBMC incubation with EPs 7630, we focused our analysis on MAP kinase, NF-\u03baB, and PI3K pathways. Respective Western blot analyses revealed that EPs 7630 activated the MAP kinases JNK1/2, p38, and ERK1/2. Additionally we observed a slight activation of the PI3K (phosphorylation of Akt) and NF-\u03baB (phosphorylation of p65) pathways, whereas STAT5 expectedly remained unaffected (Fig 3C). In line with the different cytokine profiles induced by EPs 7630 versus TLR3 and TLR4 ligands, cytokine mixture, and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies, the pattern of activated kinases by EPs 7630 was unique. By pharmacological blocking using the selective inhibitors SP600125 (JNK1/2/3), PD98059 (MEK; activator of ERK1/2), SB202190 (p38\u03b1/\u03b2), and wedelolactone (I\u03baB kinase), we observed that EPs 7630-induced production of TNF-\u03b1 in monocytes was strongly dependent on p38 activity and at least partly dependent on the activation of Erk1/2 and NF-\u03baB (Fig 3D).",

Importantly, the cytokine profile induced by EPs 7630 was completely different from that induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents that caused production of a more anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu.

Furthermore, analysis of EPs 7630 for the presence of contaminating bacterial lipopolysaccharide by a Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay revealed a very low content of less than 200 EU/mg, which is equivalent to about 20 ng/mg. Currently, it is not known which constituents of EPs 7630 are responsible for the observed effects on cytokine production. Previous investigations have suggested that the antiviral activity of the extract is primarily due to its content of prodelphinidins [7]. As these complex molecules may not be systemically bioavailable, further studies are required to demonstrate whether the clinically observed therapeutic effect of EPs 7630 is mediated by components different from prodelphinidins via stimulation of the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract.",

This observation suggests that taking EPs 7630 before infection might reduce flu-like symptoms during infection, which are associated with the action of TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, the EPs 7630 caused elevated IL-6 production during infection might strengthen the production of acute phase proteins, neutrophilic granulocyte generation in the bone marrow, and the establishment of adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells. In fact, the differentiation of Th17 cells is, besides IL-1\u03b2, IL-23 and TGF-\u03b2, particularly dependent on the presence of IL-6 [34]. Furthermore, IL-6 also cooperates with TNF-\u03b1 in inducing the differentiation of Th22 cells [32, 35] and both Th17 and Th22 cells play an essential role in the defense against microbes at body barriers [36, 37]. Thus, by indirect induction of Th17 and Th22 responses, EPs 7630 treatment of patients may promote the adaptive host defense against different viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens at respiratory epithelia.",
