            "text": "Tight control of gene expression is achieved not only at the level of transcription, but also by modulating post-transcriptional events such as mRNA turnover. Indeed, recent studies show that changes in mRNA stability account for as much as 40% to 60% of the changes in steady-state mRNA levels in basic cellular processes such as signaling pathways [1], stress responses [2] and cell differentiation [3]. A core set of conserved enzymes is responsible for both basal and regulated mRNA degradation in eukaryotes, including two potent exoribonucleases, the 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease Xrn1 and a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonucleolytic complex called the exosome (reviewed in [4], [5]). The activity of these exonucleases on eukaryotic mRNAs is kept in check by the presence of a 5\u2032 7-methylguanosine cap and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, which prevent access to the message body. Poly(A) removal by one of the cellular deadenylases is likely the rate limiting step of basal mRNA degradation [6] and is in turn required for message decapping [7] by the Dcp2 enzyme in complex with the activator Dcp1A and other cofactors [8], [9]. Endonucleases are also emerging as important contributors to eukaryotic mRNA decay, particularly in the context of quality control pathways or other situations requiring rapid inactivation of select messages [10].",

            "text": "Because of the central role of mRNA degradation in gene expression regulation, viruses presumably interact with cellular RNA degradation machinery in the process of taking control of the cell for their own replication. Viruses often interface with degradation pathways to prevent turnover of their genomic or messenger RNAs [11], [12], and can downregulate specific messages using both viral and cellular microRNAs (miRNAs), often to modulate immune evasion or other steps in their lifecycle [13]. Some viruses can even co-opt core mRNA degradation components for their own purposes, as flaviviruses do to generate noncoding subgenomic viral RNAs [14]. However, no example has been found of viruses that use the mRNA turnover machinery to broadly target cellular messages for destruction. Several virus-encoded factors can cause widespread degradation of cellular mRNAs and block host gene expression (host shutoff), but it is unclear what role host pathways play in this context [15], [16], [17], [18].",

            "text": "One of the viruses causing extensive host mRNA degradation is Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and B-cell type multicentric Castleman's disease [19], [20], [21]. During lytic infection with KSHV or other human and murine gammaherpesviruses, expression of the viral protein SOX (ORF37; BGLF5 in Epstein-Barr virus) induces degradation of the majority of the cellular messenger RNAs [15], [18], [22], [23], [24]. This depletion of cytoplasmic mRNAs leads to nuclear relocalization of poly(A) binding protein (PABPC), which subsequently drives mRNA hyperadenylation in the nucleus and a concomitant mRNA export block [25], [26], [27]. Thus, SOX activity in the cytoplasm triggers a cascade of events that further restricts gene expression. SOX belongs to a family of DNA alkaline exonucleases (DNases) that are conserved in all herpesviral subfamilies and have roles in processing and maturation of the newly replicated viral DNA genomes. In vitro, several herpesviral SOX homologs exhibit robust 5\u2032-3\u2032 DNase activity and weaker exonuclease activity towards RNA substrates [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. It is notable, however, that only the homologs from viruses of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily can promote RNA turnover in cells, and in these proteins the DNase and host shutoff activities can be genetically separated [15], [33]. It is therefore unclear to what extent the in vitro RNase activity contributes to the host shutoff activity in cells, and what cellular cofactors may participate in the specific targeting and efficient destruction of mRNAs.",

            "text": "Here, we show that the mechanism of KSHV-induced mRNA turnover involves the coordinated activities of SOX and the cellular 5\u2032-3\u2032 ribonuclease Xrn1. Unlike canonical cellular mRNA decay, in which Xrn1 generally gains access to mRNAs only after deadenylation and decapping, SOX generates substrates for Xrn1 that have not undergone these rate-limiting events. Our data suggest that this occurs via a SOX-induced site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage on each mRNA, thus providing an accessible 5\u2032 end for Xrn1-mediated degradation of the mRNA body. Furthermore, we show that SOX co-sediments with 40S translation initiation complexes, and causes mRNA cleavage at an early stage of translation. SOX specifically targets polymerase (Pol) II-generated mRNAs, but not RNAs transcribed by Pol I or Pol III. This leads to a global depletion of cellular mRNAs in polysomes, and explains the preferential targeting of messenger RNAs during host shutoff. Our data suggest a model in which the virus co-opts host mRNA decay pathways to rapidly liberate cellular translation machinery, presumably to create an optimal host environment for viral gene expression and replication.",

            "text": "The KSHV protein SOX and its homologs in other gammaherpesviruses are potent inducers of cellular mRNA degradation. While they have also recently been shown to exhibit RNase activity in vitro, mutational analyses indicated that this activity cannot fully account for SOX-induced mRNA degradation in cells [28]. We therefore hypothesized that SOX co-opts cellular mRNA degradation machinery to enact host transcriptome destruction. We reasoned that the 5\u2032-3\u2032 exoribonuclease Xrn1 would be a likely candidate co-factor, as it plays a major role in basal mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm. To test the involvement of Xrn1 in SOX-mediated mRNA degradation, we monitored SOX-induced turnover of a GFP reporter mRNA in 293T cells upon transfection of Xrn1-specific versus control small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Unexpectedly, depletion of Xrn1 did not protect full-length GFP mRNA, but it resulted instead in accumulation of a shorter GFP RNA intermediate (Figure 1A). The intermediate could be specifically detected by Northern blotting with probes against the 3\u2032 but not the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA (Figure 1A), indicating a 5\u2032 end truncation. The reliance on Xrn1 to assist in the degradation of mRNA in SOX-expressing cells was also observed for three additional reporter mRNAs, including DsRed2 (Figure 1B and S1A-B) and for the endogenous cellular transcript glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Figure 1C). Notably, although the full-length GFP and DsRed2 reporter mRNAs are of similar size (1.2\u20131.5 kb), the lengths of their degradation intermediates were different: the GFP fragment was approximately 1.1 kb whereas the DsRed2 fragment was \u223c600 bp (data not shown). In addition, the GAPDH mRNA generated multiple cleavage intermediates. This indicates that the generation of the intermediates is not controlled by a positional cue, such as distance from the mRNA ends.",

In SOX expressing cells, insertion of the SLII element within the 3\u2032 UTR of the DsRed2 reporter resulted in the appearance of a protected fragment of a size consistent with the portion of the mRNA downstream of the SLII (Figure 1D). In contrast, RNA fragments were not observed upon insertion of the SLII in the DsRed2 coding region upstream of the predicted 5\u2032 end of the intermediate or in the 5\u2032 UTR. This agrees with the observation that the 5\u2032 portion of the mRNA is removed via an Xrn1-independent mechanism. Results consistent with this interpretation were also obtained for the GFP and \u03b2-globin reporters (Figure S1C\u2013E). Collectively, our data suggest that SOX-mediated RNA depletion is a two-step process: an initiating event that removes a portion of the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA, which is then followed by exonucleolytic degradation of the remaining fragment by the host Xrn1 enzyme.",

Moreover, deadenylation is thought to be the rate-limiting step regulating mRNA degradation. Several results, however, indicate that SOX promotes mRNA degradation by Xrn1 while bypassing the requirement for deadenylation. Whereas the effects of a single copy of the Xrn1-blocking SLII element were only apparent in cells transfected with SOX (as these undergo enhanced mRNA turnover) (Figure 1D and S1D-E), insertion of two copies of the SLII (GFP-2xSLII, Figure S2A) led to a stronger Xrn1 block that can be visualized during basal GFP mRNA turnover even in cells lacking SOX (Figure 2A). In the absence of SOX, in vitro removal of the poly(A) tails by incubation with oligo(dT) and RNase H had little effect on the mobility of the degradation fragment resulting from the GFP-2xSLII construct, confirming that this fragment was generated after deadenylation. In contrast, the fragment produced in SOX-expressing cells was significantly larger prior to RNase H treatment, indicating that the cleaved fragment retained its poly(A) tail (Figure 2A).",

Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed SOX-induced mRNA turnover in cells overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of the Dcp2 decapping enzyme, Dcp2 E148Q (J. Lykke-Andersen, personal communication; [34]), that had also been subjected to siRNA-mediated depletion of the decapping co-activator Dcp1A (Figure 2D and S2C). Although at least one additional decapping enzyme exists in mammalian cells [35], overexpression of the Dcp2 mutant was sufficient to reduce basal mRNA turnover of the GFP-2xSLII reporter, consistent with an inhibition of decapping activity (Figure S2B). We also depleted levels of the hRrp41 subunit of the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exosome and saw no difference between control and exosome siRNA-treated cells in our assay, in agreement with previous observations [25] (Figure S2D). Neither 5\u2032 nor 3\u2032 degradation fragments were detected upon hRrp41 knockdown (Figure S2E). A caveat with siRNA knockdown experiments in general is that negative results could be due to insufficient depletion of the protein. However, taken together our data suggest that the viral SOX protein interfaces specifically with the Xrn1 enzyme to accomplish host shutoff. In addition, these results further argue that removal of the 5\u2032 portion of the RNA occurs independently of the canonical 5\u2032-3\u2032 decay pathway.",

Indeed, the defined length of the intermediates that we observe following Xrn1 depletion is strikingly reminiscent of the Smg6-cleaved intermediates seen during nonsense mediated decay (NMD) [36], [37]. A defined-length intermediate also suggests that cleavage is directed to a specific location or sequence within the mRNA. The different size of the intermediate observed in GFP and DsRed2 (compare Figures 1A and 1B) further indicated that a specific element, rather than positional information, is likely to direct the truncation. To test whether there is a specific sequence that leads to an endonucleolytic cut in the presence of SOX, we constructed a modified GFP reporter that contained an internal in-frame repeat of a 201 nt region encompassing the predicted cleavage site (Figure 3A, GFPrep). If this region contained an element targeted by an endonuclease, we expected that in the presence of SOX, GFPrep would give rise to two intermediates, assuming that the two cleavage events were equally likely and mutually exclusive. Indeed, we found that the GFPrep reporter generated two intermediates of sizes corresponding to two independent cleavage events (Figure 3B, arrowheads). These data suggest that an element within the initial 201 nucleotides of the GFP coding region directs an endonucleolytic cleavage in SOX-expressing cells.",

In all cases our RACE results confirmed what we had previously seen with the Northern blot analysis, in that a single predominant intermediate was amplified in Xrn1-depleted cells in a SOX-dependent manner (Figure 3D and data not shown). The majority of the sequences within this band terminated at a single nucleotide or within few nucleotides of each other (Figure S3). Analysis of the sequences surrounding the cleavage site for each mRNA revealed a conserved stretch of five bases (TGAAG) just upstream of the cleavage site. Deletion of the TGAAG element from the GFP construct abolished production of the cleavage fragment, confirming its role in SOX targeting (Figure 3E). However, insertion of this sequence alone (nt 131\u2013138) or of a 25-nucleotide stretch (nt 126\u2013150) surrounding the GFP cleavage site was not sufficient to elicit generation of a second fragment (Figure 3F).

Thus, it is possible that SOX itself carries out the initial truncation of mRNAs in cells. Recently, the structure of SOX and its homolog BGLF5 in Epstein-Barr virus were solved, leading to the identification of catalytic residues responsible for the DNase activity of these proteins, as well as putative DNA binding residues [28], [30], [41]. Mutation of one of the catalytic residues in BGLF5 (D203S) was shown to abolish all in vitro nuclease activity without misfolding the protein [30]. To test whether the SOX catalytic core is required for host shutoff in vivo, we generated individual SOX mutants for each of the catalytic residues identified in the crystal structures: E184A, D221A or D221S (equivalent to D203S in BGLF5), E244A and K246I. Indeed, mutation of any one of the catalytic residues abolished the ability of SOX to deplete GFP mRNA in cells (Figure 4A). As a control, we mutated the putative DNA-binding residues (W135V, R139I, S144I, S146I, S219A, Q376G), which are also located in the active site cleft (Figure S4C), and found that only residues R139, S144 and Q376 were required for host shutoff (Figure 4B). This suggests that SOX may bind RNA and DNA using partially overlapping residues. In contrast with our host shutoff data, all the catalytic and putative DNA binding residues tested were required for in vitro DNase activity (Figure S4A and S4B). Thus, our mutational analysis suggests that the catalytic activity of SOX- presumably the RNase activity- is required for host shutoff.",

We used a line of BCBL-1 cells bearing an inducible version of the KSHV major lytic transactivator RTA (TREx BCBL-1-RTA) [45] to allow efficient lytic reactivation following RTA induction. Upon chemical stimulation of lytic KSHV replication in these cells (when SOX is expressed from the viral genome), we observed a significant decrease in the polysome population and a corresponding increase in 80S monosomes, consistent with degradation of actively translating mRNAs (Figure 5A). It should be noted that the level of polysome depletion during viral infection is likely underestimated, as \u223c20% of induced cells generally fail to enter the lytic cycle. The depletion of polyribosomes was not due to chemical treatment alone, because treatment of the KSHV negative BJAB B cell line did not result in a similar decrease in polysomes (data not shown). We next looked for the presence of SOX in gradient fractions from the corresponding polysome profiles of lytically reactivated BCBL-1 cells. As controls, we also blotted for PAIP2A, a protein not found in polysomes [46], as well as the ribosomal protein RPS3 (Figure 5B). SOX appeared to sediment primarily with the ribonucleoprotein (RNP), 40S, and monosome fractions, and exhibited partial overlap with RPS3 (Figure 5B). Puromycin treatment disrupted polysomes but failed to alter the SOX sedimentation profile, arguing against a specific association with the 80S and polysome fractions (data not shown). To more accurately determine its sedimentation profile, we increased the resolution of the lighter molecular weight complexes using lower density sucrose gradients. These experiments revealed that SOX indeed sediments in both the RNP and 40S fractions, similar to Xrn1 (Figure 5C). Its sedimentation profile also overlapped with the eIF3j and eIF2\u03b1 components of the 40S pre-initiation complex, which is recruited to the 5\u2032 cap prior to ribosomal scanning (Figure 5C). This is in contrast to the sedimentation of PABPC, which remains bound to the mRNA throughout the polysome fractions as well (Figure 5C; data not shown). Similar data were obtained upon transient expression of SOX in 293T cells (Figure S5A). We also tested the sedimentation profile of the SOX D221S catalytic mutant, and found it to mimic that of wild-type SOX (Figure S5B), indicating that the catalytic site of the protein is unlikely to be involved in its recruitment to target RNAs.",

Indeed, expression of wild-type SOX alone caused a significant depletion of polysomes relative to vector-transfected cells, whereas neither of the host shutoff defective SOX mutants had this effect (Figure 5D).

Using a pure population of cells expressing GFP-SOX or GFP alone, we found that neither the endogenous Pol III-generated Y3 and 7SL cytoplasmic non-coding RNAs, nor the 18S rRNA transcribed by Pol I undergo turnover in the presence of SOX (Figure 6A). In contrast, we observed significant depletion of endogenous mRNAs transcribed by Pol II, including GAPDH, \u03b2-actin, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in SOX-expressing cells (Figure 6A). In principle, the inability of SOX to degrade the non-Pol II transcripts could be due to the absence of an ORF, or the presence of RNP complexes occluding SOX cleavage sites. To exclude these possibilities, we expressed the GFP reporter under the control of Pol I or Pol III promoters and found that in both cases, the GFP RNA was not targeted by SOX (Figure 6B). We confirmed using subcellular fractionation experiments that the inability of SOX to promote degradation of these RNAs was not due to a failure of the RNAs to be exported (Figure S6E and S6F).

Indeed, insertion of \u0394EMCV into the GFP 5\u2032 UTR 30 nt from the cap significantly reduced GFP protein accumulation (Figure 6E). However, in Xrn1-depleted cells, SOX still induced cleavage of this mRNA with similar efficiency as wild-type GFP, and at the same site (Figure 6F). In agreement with the \u0394EMCV-GFP data, we observed that SOX could also promote turnover of a GFP mRNA with a 60 nt adenylate tract inserted in the 5\u2032 UTR (5\u2032A60-GFP) (Figure S6D), which similarly reduced GFP protein production (Figure S6C). A 50\u201370 nt adenylate-rich tract in the 5\u2032 UTR of PABPC has likewise been shown to repress translation of its message in an autoregulatory manner as a consequence of PABPC protein binding to this region [48].

Thus, the virus is able to make use of the available host mRNA turnover machinery, yet bypass the rate limiting events that normally precede activation of Xrn1. Collectively, these data and our previous studies reconcile the seemingly disparate observations that the gammaherpesvirus SOX homologs promote potent host shutoff, yet exhibit relatively weak in vitro RNase activity. We hypothesize that while SOX can catalyze RNA cleavage, it does so in a site-specific manner in cells and requires one or more cellular factors to recruit and/or position it on the mRNA substrate, as well as host enzymes to complete the degradation process.",

Additionally, the observation that deadenylation and Dcp1/2-mediated decapping are not required to generate the degradation intermediate suggest that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the mRNA remain intact at the time of cleavage. We predict that SOX induces a sequence-specific rather than a position-dependent cut, as duplicating a 201 nt region surrounding the cut site yielded a second degradation intermediate, and addition of sequences upstream of the cleavage site did not alter the cleavage efficiency or location. We identified a conserved stretch of five nucleotides just upstream of the cut site in three different reporters. This consensus site was necessary, but not sufficient to elicit cleavage, suggesting that it represents a portion of a larger element required for SOX targeting. We hypothesize that the full element is a complex sequence or structure, perhaps degenerate, enabling it to be widespread among cellular mRNAs.",

Eukaryotic translation initiates with the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the cap via interactions with translation initiation factors, followed by scanning to the AUG codon and recruitment of the 60S subunit. Two observations indicate that recognition and turnover in SOX-expressing cells are initiated prior to 60S joining. Specifically, insertion in the 5\u2032 UTR of elements that presumably inhibit or prematurely terminate 40S scanning, and thus significantly reduce protein production, does not affect SOX activity. Moreover, the degradation intermediate accumulates preferentially in the 40S fraction. Our finding that SOX cosediments with the 40S initiation complex suggests that an association with translation initiation machinery directs it to mRNAs. Supporting this prediction is the failure of SOX to target translationally incompetent reporter and endogenous RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase I or III.",

One interesting parallel to these seemingly discrepant observations is that of the E. coli endonuclease RNase E, which can cleave anywhere along the length of the RNA (preferably within AU-rich sequences), but requires a monophosphate at the mRNA 5\u2032 end. Thus, similar to our proposed model for SOX activity, RNase E can simultaneously recognize two non-adjacent regions of the primary RNA sequence [61]. These observations can be reconciled by the fact that RNAs adopt secondary and tertiary structures within a cell that could presumably enable such sequences to be juxtaposed.

Alphaherpesviruses and SARS coronavirus also encode host shutoff factors (vhs and nsp1, respectively) that promote mRNA degradation, but bear no homology to SOX [16], [17]. In vitro data indicate that they similarly induce endonucleolytic cleavage of RNAs, and it has been proposed that degradation of the mRNA body in cells may be assisted by host exonucleases, although this has yet to be shown [62], [63], [64], [65], [66]. In addition, all three viral proteins appear to use components of the translation machinery as a means to access mRNA [62], [65], [67], [68], [69]. Such parallels suggest that these viruses have adopted remarkably similar strategies to execute mRNA decay, resembling those of host pathways like NMD. In addition to the enhanced rate of decay afforded by an endonucleolytic mechanism, the advantage for the virus may be that this strategy of host shutoff generates intermediates that look indistinguishable from products of quality control pathways. Such intermediates would then be readily degraded by the core degradation machinery and might not be recognized as aberrant, perhaps avoiding activation of stress or innate immune responses. Thus, understanding how viral endonucleases interface with host pathways may provide insight into how manipulation of these pathways contributes to infectious disease, as well as into events that regulate cellular RNA decay.",
