            "text": "Transdifferentiation involves reprogramming one type of adult cell into another mature cell type, without having to generate intermediary stem cells. It has received significant attention because it may have a considerable number of applications in cell and cancer therapy. Successful transdifferentiation from one cell type to another by overexpressing lineage-specific genes in vivo (Takeuchi & \n[Bruneau 2009]; Zhou et al. \n[2008]) and in vitro (Graf & \n[Enver 2009]; Ieda et al. \n[2010]) has been previously reported. Not only can cell transdifferentiation be enforced through the overexpression of the appropriate set of genes, but also through the application of specific molecules, which is a promising alternative to conventional chemotherapy for cancer treatment, for example, the use of all-trans-Retinoid acid (ATRA) for the treatment of acute promyelocitic leukemia (APL) (Kakizuka et al. \n[1991]). The fact that there was no treatment based on cell differentiation therapy for solid tumors prompted us to study whether novel transdifferentiating molecules secreted by human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) could prevent cancer progression. Our studies showed that, irrespective of the presence of hESCs, albumin-associated lipids (albuMAX\u00ae), and specifically poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids (linoleic, oleic, petroselinic and palmitoleic acids) accounted for the transdifferentiation of several distinct human cancer cell lines (HCCLs) into adipocyte-like cells (Ruiz-Vela et al. \n[2011]).",

            "text": "Endocytosis regulates the entry of nutrients, hormones and signaling factors into the cell, and serves to regulate the internalization of transmembrane receptors. During endocytosis the plasma membrane invaginates to form a new intracellular vesicle containing various cargo molecules and material to be internalized from the external environment (Conner & \n[Schmid 2003]). Clathrin (CLTC)-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major endocytic route and is assumed to regulate ligand mediated signal transduction by disrupting ligand-receptor interactions after their uptake into endosomal compartments (\n[Andersson 2012]). It can sequester the receptors in intracellular compartments, target ligand-receptor complexes to lysosomes for degradation, or recycle them by sending them back to the cell surface for re-use (Maxfield & Mc\n[Graw 2004]). Several in vitro studies have reported evidence for a relationship between the endocytosis of ligands such as Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and oxidized Low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), bound to their respective receptors, and their key roles in different transdifferentiation models (Rauch et al. \n[2002]; Yu et al. \n[2010]). Others have shown that the incorporation of insulin regulated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) into the cell plasma membrane, a process required for adipogenesis, is dependent on clathrin coated vesicles (Huang et al. \n[2007]). However, the existence of a direct correlation between endocytic ligand-receptor complex internalization and the transcription of genes controlling critical physiological events, such as cell transdifferentiation or adipogenesis, remains largely uninvestigated.",

In this study we aimed to characterize the adipocyte-like cells resulting from melanoma MALME-3M and breast carcinoma MCF-7 transdifferentiation programs and to set the key pathways that were concomitantly affected in these programs. In order to document induced-transdifferentiation we report the loss of pigmentation in MALME-3M cells, the upregulation of PLIN2 protein expression in the studied HCCLs and the upregulation of gene expression of PLIN2 and other commonly considered key adipogenic markers such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) in MALME-3M cells. These results also revealed an alternative gene splicing of the adipogenic master regulator PPARG that was likely to be related to the upregulation of the protein found in transdifferentiated MALME-3M cells, previously reported by our group (Ruiz-Vela et al. \n[2011]). Most importantly, our results also showed an increase in Clathrin (CLTC) expression and we provided evidence that Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis (CME) was essential for the transdifferentiation programs of the breast adenocarcinoma and melanoma HCCLs we investigated into adipocyte-like cells.",

As Figure \n1A shows, the pellet from cells treated with albumin-associated lipids was much lighter in color than the pellet corresponding to the mock-treated cells, indicating a marked loss of pigmentation in the albumin-associated lipid-treated cells. In order to analyze the ultrastructural features responsible for the observed loss of pigmentation in the treated cells we used Electron Microscopy (EM). EM studies showed large clusters of dark vesicles in mock-treated MALME-3M cells that were not present in the albumin-associated lipid-treated cells (Figure \n1B and \nAdditional file 1: Supporting information C at higher magnification). These vesicles are hallmarks of melanosomes and are responsible for the storage of melanin pigments (Raposo & \n[Marks 2007]). Thus, the EM studies suggested that the loss of pigmentation was due to impaired melanosome biogenesis. ",

We cultured MALME-3M cells with RPMI medium in the presence of albumin-associated lipids for 24 hours. As negative controls MALME-3M cells were cultured with RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (RPMI + 10% FBS) for the same period of time. mRNA was extracted and gene expression was quantified by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Over 2,000 genes were identified as differentially expressed between the treated and the untreated cells. Gene expression analysis of the MALME-3M to adipocyte-like transdifferentiation demonstrated a significant upregulation of genes that participate in functions related to endocytosis (Table \n1A and \nAdditional file 2: Supporting information A). Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes also indicated the over representation of Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to endocytosis (Table \n1B). The results obtained pointed towards the upregulation of CLTC and other adaptor proteins involved in vesicle coating (Table \n1A). CLTC heavy chain (CLTC-Hc) was shown to be upregulated by a fold change of 1.46. The adaptin proteins such as the adaptor-related complexes AP1B1 (1.62 fold change), AP1G1 (1.53 fold change), AP1S3 (2.29 fold change), AP2A1 (1.83 fold change), Synergin (1.26 fold change) and AP3M1 (1.24 fold change) were also upregulated. These are important components of the CLTC-coated vesicles that mediate the internalization of ligand-receptor complexes and the transport of enzymes from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to lysosomes (Pearse et al. \n[2000]).

Our findings indicated that the connection between albumin-associated lipids and pluripotency (Garcia-Gonzalo & Izpisua \n[Belmonte 2008]) is far more complex than previously anticipated. In addition to maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency in hESCs (Garcia-Gonzalo & Izpisua \n[Belmonte 2008]), a role for albumin (\n[Kallee 1996]) and its associated lipids (Davis & \n[Dubos 1947]; Thomas et al. \n[1995]; Lafond et al. \n[1994]) has been discovered in adipogenesis in other cell types (Schopfer et al. \n[2005]). Our results also indicate that certain albumin complex associated poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids induce terminal differentiation and arrest cancer progression (Ruiz-Vela et al. \n[2011]). Concomitanlty to our studies, Khan et al. have also described the specific growth inhibition of esters of oleic acid and ricinoleic acid against the human skin malignant melanoma cell line (SK-MEL-1) (Khan et al. \n[2012]). Despite the important findings that we describe here, many key questions remain unanswered in the identification of novel genes and proteins that mediate the terminal transdifferentiation of human cancer cells. To get a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transdifferentiation we concentrated our efforts on the role of those genes that are differentially regulated during the process.",

Several adipocytic markers such as PLIN2, LPL and PPARA were significantly upregulated. PPARA could be upregulated merely as a consequence of fatty acid accumulation as it has been shown to be involved in the regulation of obesity in rodents by increasing hepatic fatty acid oxidation (Kersten et al. \n[1999]). LPL is a well describedadipocyte marker as it regulates the hydrolysis of triglycerides in the adipose tissue (Mead et al. \n[2002]). Interestingly, PPARG1, an adipogenesis marker shown to be upregulated upon HCCL to adipocyte transdifferentiation (Ruiz-Vela et al. \n[2011]), showed a differential mapping pattern between the albumin-associated lipid-treated and non-treated cells. The PPARG gene has eight exons which are translated and spliced into different isoforms (\nhttp://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000132170;r=3:12328867-12475855), with the PPARG1 isoform being the primary transcript expressed in adipocytes. In treated cells, PPARG showed whole transcript expression, while in mock-treated cells no expression of exons 4 and 5 was evident ( \nAdditional file 3: Supporting information B). These two exons encode the Zinc finger binding site domain of the PPARG1 transcription factor (Finn et al. \n[2010]). The lack or downregulation of these functional domains in the non-treated cells might be indicative of the differential processing of this gene in the MALME-3M cell lines and of differential expression of the protein (Ruiz-Vela et al. \n[2011]).",

Adaptor-related proteins are key components of clathrin coated vesicles that can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes (Pearse et al. \n[2000]). AP1 and AP3 are found at the coated vesicles located at the Golgi complex and it has been suggested that both associate with GLUT4 transporting vesicles and mediate distinct intracellular sorting events at the level of the TGN and endosomes in rat adipocytes (Gillingham et al. \n[1999]).

Cells were transiently transfected with CONT (Control) SiRNA or with CLTC SiRNA for 72 hours prior to the addition of the vehicle 24 hours prior to cell lysation.
