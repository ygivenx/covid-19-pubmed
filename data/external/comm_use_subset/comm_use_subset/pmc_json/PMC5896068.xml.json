This has critically challenged the public health emergency management systems (PHEMSs) of many countries [2], especially developing countries. The global community quickly reached a consensus on the development of the PHEMSs [3]. In 2005, the 58th World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted the revised International Health Regulations, which instructed the World Health Organization (WHO) member states to collaboratively confront public health emergencies of global concern. A World Health Report in 2007 also focused on global public health security in the twenty-first century. The Ebola outbreak in 2014\u20132015 has pushed the process of WHO reform into high gear [4], giving top priority to changes in the WHO\u2019s emergency operations and a need to build resilient health systems that can withstand epidemics.",

These aroused the public\u2019s horror and international community\u2019s blame.

Some researchers expressed the importance of PHEMS and the progress after SARS qualitatively [7, 8]. Others quantitatively accessed the trends using regional data, usually at a certain level or within a certain province or city [9\u201312]. Time spans were restricted to early-phase usually around 2005 [13]. To our knowledge, little evidence could tell the differences that happened in China\u2019s PHEMS in this decade.",

We conducted a multistage sampling to select CDCs at different administration levels, selected all 32 provincial CDCs and used systematic random sampling to select municipal and county CDCs. As governmental funding is the most critical control point of public health emergency management for the CDCs [15],we used \u201cgovernmental funding to CDCs per thousand people\u201d as a basis to determine sample size [16].
