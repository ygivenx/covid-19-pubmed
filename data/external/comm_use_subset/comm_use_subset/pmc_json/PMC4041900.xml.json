The overall structures of all coronaviruses are composed of the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The other non-structural proteins like RNA directed RNA polymerase, helicase, 3CL like proteinases etc are produced by the cleavage of replicase polyprotein 1ab or ORF 1ab polyprotein [3].",

As these viruses are now becoming pathogenic and causing outbreaks, so steps have to be taken to prevent human death. Vaccination is one of the most efficient ways to prevent infectious disease [19]. Effective vaccines controlling virus spread and disease are available for a number of infections, such as smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, influenza, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B [20]. For coronavirus, this vaccine approach is hindered by the fact that human coronavirus strains are not structurally related and they are changing rapidly by recombination [21]. Therefore, designing a universal vaccine against conserved regions for all human coronaviruses is a major challenge at present.",

Though the first two strains were not so much deadly but the other members were pathogenic. After SARS outbreak, a new coronavirus strain called MERS-CoV is now going to cause another outbreak [4]. The cell tropism and cellular receptor of the six types of coronaviruses are not similar (Additional file 7: Table S1). Though at first it was thought that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are structurally similar and tried to treat MERS-CoV infected patient with the SASR-CoV treatment. But it was found that they bind to two different receptors, namely ACE2 and DPP4 or CD26 respectively [36]. These viruses are actually zoonotic origin, undergo recombination, and may be in future another strain of this group of virus will come [37]. Therefore, it is important to take preventing measures not only to prevent this new strain of coronavirus, also against all the strain of coronavirus. There is no recommended vaccine for coronaviruses which is necessary to prevent. Most of the cases, vaccines were designed by targeting spike protein. Similarly, researchers also reported to design vaccine against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike protein [38,39]. Fernando et al. also designed lived-attenuated MERS coronavirus by mutating MERS-CoV envelope protein as a vaccine which will be for only MERS-CoV [40]. These vaccines would thus be effective for only those strains not for others. Giving a universal vaccine for all strain of viruses is much more promising solution rather than giving individual vaccine for individual strain.",

But now a day\u2019s these vaccine concepts are greatly replaced by novel vaccine approaches like naked DNA vaccine, epitope based vaccine.

For this purpose we did multiple sequence alignment of the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab of all six human coronaviruses. Replicase polyprotein 1ab was taken to check whether there is any conservancy among the non structural protein as this replicase polyprotein cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins. In case of S, E, M and N protein, no putative conserved region was found. But conserved region was found in case of replicae polyprotein 1ab where the conserved region was in the RNA directed RNA polymerase. This indicates that this protein is less mutating than the S, E, M and N protein. This RNA directed RNA polymerase protein was targeted to determine antigenic sites based on immunogenicity and surface accessibility using different bioinformatics analyses. The consensus antigenic sites were the desired one and their conservancy was also determined. From the conservancy analysis it was found that Bepipred [29] and IEDB [28] analysis predicted consensus epitope YPKCDRA and the surface accessibility analysis [30] predicted epitope WDYPKC are 100% conserved. This 100% conserved WDYPKC and YPKCDRA are actually located in the same region of RNA directed RNA polymerase and it was then taken as the targeted epitope. This epitope was found to be accessible and hydrophilic which is one of the crucial requirements for an epitope to be used as a vaccine. This reflects a promising scope to use this conserved epitope as a universal vaccine both as preventive and therapeutic treatment. As this epitope remain long been conserved since 1960, it may be possible to use this vaccine in future for upcoming human coronavirus strains as well. To become an effective vaccine, it needs to be highly immunogenic, stable inside the body. If it is poorly immunogenic or unstable, it needs to be conjugated with adjuvant [44]. Though this epitope based vaccine is designed by in silico analyses, the actual immunogenicity, stability, efficacy and their delivery strategy inside the recipients body can\u2019t be determined by this in silico analysis. To address these questions in vitro and in vivo experiments are essential.",
