A significant number of those with chronic infection will develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or liver failure, resulting in approximately 400,000 deaths each year [1]. Recently approved combination regimens of DAAs, such as sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ledipasvir or velpatasvir and glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, have not only drastically improved efficacy outcomes, but have decreased treatment side effects compared to the interferon-containing regimens of the past [2]. Indeed, these regimens have produced sustained virologic response (SVR) rates greater than 90%, and with treatment duration of 8\u201312 weeks, depending on the regimen and patient population, have resulted in sustained virologic cures. Despite these recent advances, significant challenges remain in managing difficult-to-treat populations including those with HCV genotype (GT) 3 infection, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience. These populations typically require at least 12 weeks of treatment, often in combination with ribavirin, which increases the risk of serious side effects [3], or they are not able to receive treatment regimens containing a protease inhibitor due to their advanced liver disease [4]. Therefore, an ideal regimen would have high efficacy based on shorter treatment duration for most, if not all, patient populations, with an improved safety profile that includes less drug-drug interaction potential compared to some currently approved regimens.",

            "text": "For the treatment of HCV, DAAs have been developed that target different critical steps in the HCV life cycle. One such target of interest is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), encoded by the NS5B region of the HCV genome, which is essential for viral replication. Thus, nucleotide analogs that can be converted to their triphosphate analog within cells, incorporated into nascent HCV RNA, and block viral replication are preferred candidates since they have proven to be potent, pan-genotypic inhibitors with a high barrier to drug resistance. In addition, the apparent improved antiviral activity of guanosine analogs, compared to pyrimidine analogs such as SOF [5], had prompted a search for modified guanosine analogs containing a proven substituted ribose moiety with a monophosphate prodrug. Previously identified guanosine analogs such as PSI-938 (a cyclic phosphate prodrug of 2\u2019-fluoro-2\u2019-C-methylguanosine-5\u2019-monophosphate) and BMS-986094 (a prodrug of 2\u2019-C-methylguanosine-5\u2019-monophosphate) had excellent activity against HCV replication, but their development was halted due to observed hepatic and cardiac toxicity, respectively [6, 7]. The structures of AT-527, SOF, PSI-938 and BMS-986094 as well as PSI-661, a structurally-related HCV inhibitor that showed potent in vitro activity against HCV [8], are presented in Fig 1.",

            "text": "We are presently developing AT-527, whose putative metabolic pathway is presented in Fig 2. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a phosphoramidate prodrug of 2\u2019-fluoro-2\u2019-C-methylguanosine-5\u2019-monophosphate. The phosphoramidate moiety of AT-527 is identical to that of SOF [9] and is presumed to be subject to the same initial metabolic activation pathway leading to the unique nucleotide monophosphate (MP) still containing the N6-methyl modification (M2), that is, hydrolysis catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) and/or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) producing the L-alanyl intermediate (M1), followed by removal of the amino acid moiety by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) resulting in the MP metabolite, M2. As with PSI-938, M2 is likely converted to M3 by adenosine deaminase like protein 1 (ADALP1; [10]) and further anabolized sequentially by guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) to the pharmacologically active triphosphate (TP), AT-9010. Presumably, both M2 and M3 can be dephosphorylated by 5\u2019-nucleotidase (5\u2019-NTase) to their respective nucleosides M4 and AT-273 (Fig 2). Thus, AT-527 possesses a unique structural feature with an N6-methyl group which critically differentiates it from other guanosine nucleotide analogs with respect to drug metabolism and provides the compound with a favorable preclinical safety profile while maintaining highly potent antiviral activity, supporting its clinical development.",

Although the active form of all three drugs were utilized by POLRMT in vitro, and this incorporation prevented subsequent cycles of nucleotide addition (S1\u2013S3 Figs), their efficiency of incorporation (kpol/Kd,app) was poor compared to the corresponding natural nucleotide (Table 5). The incorporation efficiencies of AT-9010 and SOF TP were within two-fold, whereas the TP of BMS-986094 was incorporated by POLRMT 55 times more efficiently than SOF TP.",

Similarly, mean liver/heart concentration ratios for AT-9010 in male monkeys 4 hr after an oral dose of AT-527 at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg (n = 2 per dose) were 11\u201331 (Table 9), indicating preferential formation of the active TP in the liver of both species. In fact, in all heart tissues except one from a rat dosed at 500 mg/kg, concentrations of AT-9010 had to be estimated by extrapolation of the calibration curves below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the LC-MS/MS assay (110 pmol/g). Moreover, as was observed in hepatocytes and Huh-7 cells, the active TP was the predominant metabolite measured in 4-h monkey livers at 30 and 100 mg/kg and its concentrations were dose proportional (545 \u00b1 349 and 1890 \u00b1 519 pmol/g, respectively) (Table 9). At the lower more therapeutically relevant dose of 30 mg/kg, the mean liver AT-9010 concentration was 34-fold higher than its parent phosphoramidate, again demonstrating efficient conversion of AT-511 to the active TP in liver cells. Monkey livers had 500-fold more AT-511 after the 300 mg/kg dose compared to the 30 mg/kg dose, suggesting that conversion to M1 via esterase activity becomes saturated at a very high dose. Nevertheless, even at this high dose, AT-9010 concentrations were 18 times higher in liver compared to corresponding heart tissues. In addition to the high liver/heart ratios for AT-9010 in monkeys, the similarly high ratios for its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 (11\u201372), are further evidence that these compounds are preferentially delivered to the liver, the target organ for HCV infection. As was observed in hepatocytes from all species tested, the 5\u2019-TP of M2 was either not detected in monkey liver and heart tissue or possibly present but only at trace levels, well below the LLOQ of the assay (110 pmol/g).",

This is consistent with AT-273 only being formed via dephosphorylation of its phosphorylated forms (Fig 2).

Compared to SOF, AT-511 is 11\u201314 times more potent against the difficult-to-treat GT3. Moreover, AT-511 is 40\u201358 times more potent than SOF against RAVs containing the S282T polymorphism and at least 10-fold more potent than PSI-938, suggesting that AT-511 may potentially demonstrate greater clinical antiviral activity than these other two nucleotide prodrugs. This result is consistent with the high intracellular formation of the active triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, in both Huh-7 cells and in human hepatocytes. The in vivo monkey and rat studies demonstrated that AT-511 was efficiently absorbed when dosed orally as its hemi-sulfate salt, AT-527, and was extensively converted to its active TP in liver, the target of HCV infection. Despite the relatively low concentrations of AT-511 in rat plasma after oral administration of AT-527, an observation which is consistent with the known high levels of esterase activity in rodent blood [16, 17], this species produces one of the highest amounts of the active TP in hepatocyte incubations in vitro as well as liver concentrations in vivo. Additionally, the rat and monkey studies showed that oral administration of a single dose of AT-527 resulted in preferential delivery of AT-9010 and its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 to the liver, and that the active TP was the predominant intracellular phosphorylated metabolite formed.",

The lack of activity against the DNA viruses (HSV-1, adenovirus and HBV) and HIV-1 (which contains an RNA genome that requires reverse transcription into DNA) may be attributed to the dissimilarity in the polymerases involved in the replication of these viruses compared to that of HCV (a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus). The apparent specificity of AT-511 against the other single-stranded RNA viruses tested, however, suggests that there are differences in the polymerases of these related viruses that render them relatively resistant to inhibition by AT-9010. Nevertheless, the potency of AT-511 across all HCV genotypes tested speaks to the highly conserved nature of the HCV NS5B genomic region.",

Similarly, AT-273 can likely only be formed via dephosphorylation of its mono-, di- and tri-phosphorylated forms. The active TP is formed and retained intracellularly and its levels cannot be directly measured in blood samples. However, as AT-9010 is the most abundant metabolite formed in Huh-7 cells and hepatocytes in vitro and in liver tissue in vivo, plasma levels of AT-273 can be regarded as a surrogate of the intracellular levels of the active TP. Thus, the 10 h half-life of AT-9010 observed in human hepatocytes in vitro as well as the prolonged MRT of AT-273 in plasma of rats and monkeys after administration of a single oral dose of AT-527 are consistent with once daily oral dosing for treatment of HCV infections.",

Despite the potent clinical anti-HCV activity of the latter drug, development of these compounds was discontinued, with PSI-938 halted due to hepatic toxicity observed with extended dosing in the clinic [8, 19]. These early prodrugs share a similar modification on the nucleobase and are subject to the same metabolic pathway leading to formation of mutagenic metabolites with methyl or ethyl substitutions at the O6 position of guanine [15, 20, 21]. AT-527 possesses a unique structural feature with an N6-methyl group that critically differentiates AT-527 from PSI-661 and PSI-938, with respect to metabolism. The results of the rhCYP3A4 study highlight this difference since, unlike PSI-661 and PSI-938, no mutagenic O6-alkylguanine bases were formed from AT-511, and only 1.8% was converted to other modified nucleobases, thus mitigating the hepatotoxicity risk from AT-527. Moreover, with almost no inhibitory effect on a panel of cytochrome P450 enzymes, AT-527 appears to have a low potential for metabolic drug-drug interactions.",
