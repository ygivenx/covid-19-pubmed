Nowadays, MRSA becomes endemic in most hospitals around the world [1]\n[2] and accounts for 40\u201360% of all healthcare-associated S. aureus infections. Colonized patients are the major reservoirs of MRSA in hospitals. Colonizing strains may serve as endogenous sources for overt clinical infections or may spread to other patients [3]\u2013[11]. To reduce and control healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) caused by MRSA, a \u201csearch and destroy\u201d strategy, which first detects the patients with MRSA colonization and then decolonizes the MRSA with certain antimicrobial agents, was recently proposed and implemented in some hospitals of different countries, with inconsistent effects [12]\u2013[16].",

In 2000, methicillin resistance had been identified in 53\u201383% of all S. aureus isolates in 12 major hospitals of Taiwan [18]. In our neonatal ICUs (NICUs), S. aureus is the leading pathogen of HAIs and MRSA represented majority of all the S. aureus isolates since 1997. Between 1997 and 1999, the prevalence of S. aureus among the HAIs increased significantly from 32.4% in 1997, 43.6% in 1998, to 52.6% in 1999. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus isolates also rose significantly from 87.2% in 1997, 92.1% in 1998, to 95.1% in 1999 [19]. Apparently, our NICUs were endemic for MRSA. We then implemented a series of infection control interventions stepwise in our NICUs to try to reduce HAIs caused by MRSA. After a 7-year campaign, MRSA HAIs was successfully controlled temporarily with the implementation of the strategy of \u201csearch and destroy\u201d. Here, we report our experiences for MRSA control in the NICUs.",

We firstly re-enforced hand washing before and after contact with the infants hospitalized in NICUs since January 2000 by increasing infection control education of, increasing infection control practitioner's audits of, and feedback of HAIs data to the health care workers (HCWs) working in NICUs. From a case-control study conducted in 2001, we found that the presence of skin infection at onset was one of the risk factors for MRSA bacteremia in these infants [22]. Standardized operation procedures for the insertion and the continuous care of peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) were revised, aiming to accelerate the placement process (by a designated team) and to improve the aseptic care over the insertion site. Briefly, after successful insertion, 10% povidine-iodine containing alcohol (75%) was applied to the insertion site, normal saline used to decolorize, and the area was covered by a transparent dressing (\u201cTegaderm\u201d). Nurses checked the insertion site frequently and changed the dressing every 3 days. The PICC lines were not impregnated with antibacterial or antiseptic agents and antibiotic lock prophylaxis was not used. The strategy commenced in July 2001.",

The infants with MRSA colonization, if identified, were separated from non-colonized infants and placed in a segregated area of the units, and cohort care by designated nurses was implemented.

From the previous surveillance study [22], we learned that nearly 90% of the colonized infants are detected within the first 2 weeks of admission and sampling of both nares and umbilicus is adequate for surveillance cultures in this population. Hence, during this period, only specimens from both nares and umbilicus were obtained, within 24 hours of admission and then weekly for two weeks (3 times in total). In addition to placing the colonizing infants in a segregated area and cohort care, decolonization procedures with topical mupirocin ointment application to nares and umbilical area were administered twice daily for five consecutive days if they still stayed in the NICUs. If an infant with MRSA colonization had MRSA clinical isolates, the clinical isolates as well as the colonized isolates were genotyped and compared. MRSA isolates recovered from clinical diagnostic samples (beyond surveillance culture specimens) submitted to the clinical microbiologic laboratory were regarded as clinical isolates. In accordance with the standard definition of HAIs [20], any infant with clinical isolates of MRSA who was receiving antimicrobial therapy was categorized as experiencing an episode of infection. However, from August 2006 to October 2007, no active surveillance for MRSA was conducted in these NICUs since no research grants supported.",

The reduction of MRSA infection was gradual and significantly; it appeared to occur prominently for two specific time periods, from 2001 to 2002 and from 2004 to 2005. For the first time period, we revised the standardized operation procedure for insertion and continuous care of peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC). This strategy was based on our findings from the case-control study that the presence of skin infection at onset was associated with MRSA bacteremia in these infants. Augmentation of aseptic procedure and care of the insertion of central venous catheter (CVC) has been documented to be able to reduce the incidence of catheter-related bacteremia [31] and seemed to be somewhat effective in our NICUs. Conducting the strategy of surveillance culture with subsequent decolonization of MRSA carriage in two of three NICUs was the major change of infection control measures in the second time point in the current study. Compared to those during the period of surveillance culture without decolonization, both MRSA colonization rate and MRSA infection rate among the NICU infants decreased significantly. In contrast, the rate of MRSA infection among the non-colonized infants was similar during both periods; even, MRSA HA infection rate increased slightly in 2007 when the strategy of \u201csearch and destroy\u201d was discontinued since the supported grant was due. (Afterwards, another project with a cross-over design was granted and conducted since November 2007) Altogether, these findings seemed to suggest that topical mupirocin treatment may effectively decolonize MRSA carriage in these infants and reduce the subsequent MRSA infection. Though the susceptibility test of MRSA isolates to mupirocin was not performed in this series, we believe that most isolates were susceptible to mupirocin since this medication, though licensed, had not been used in Taiwan for years. However, since no control group (only historical control) was included and not every infant with MRSA colonization received topical mupirocin therapy in the current study, further studies are needed to elucidate this issue [32]\u2013[35].",

Most infants hospitalize immediately after birth and a substantial proportion of the infants are inborn. In addition, vertical transmission of MRSA is infrequently seen in newborns. Therefore, most infants do not have MRSA colonization on admission to NICUs. Then, if the HCWs working in and the environmental objects in NICUs are free form MRSA, the hospitalized infants would not acquire MRSA colonization and/or infection during their NICU stay. In the current study, between 2003 and 2006, nasal MRSA carriage rate among HCWs working in our NICUs ranged from 4.8% to 13% for 4 surveys [23]. But no survey for environmental objects was conducted during the study period. However, the condition would not change, even though MRSA may be introduced into the units anytime, if each HCW can perform hand hygiene exactly and strictly. These may partly explain why the \u201csearch and destroy\u201d strategy can be effective in our NICUs but not so effective reported from adult ICUs otherwise [14].",

This clone was almost eradicated, not identified from any clinical isolate, from our NICUs in 2006; however, it still accounted for 13% of the colonized isolates during 2005\u20132006. This clone returned and identified from clinical isolates again in 2007 and persisted in 2008 (data not shown here) but accounted for less than 20% of the clinical isolates. The clone, ST239/pulsotype A, had prevailed in our hospital (CGMH) and even the whole island between 1992 and 2001, accounting for 54% to 93% of clinical isolates from different hospitals islandwide [26],[36]\u2013[39]. However, the predominance was decreasing during 2004\u20132005 in our hospital (CGMH) [38], so was in our NICUs in the current study almost at the same time. In contrast, the clone of ST59/pulsotype C/SCCmec IV/PVL-negative accounted for one-fourth of the clinical isolates and remained relatively steady throughout the study period. The clone accounted for most colonized MRSA isolates from healthy children [27] as well as a substantial proportion of community-associated MRSA infection in Taiwan [28],[29],[40]\u2013[42] and thus was categorized as a community strain recently. More than 70% of colonized isolates from HCWs working in these NICUs also belonged to this clone during the study period, suggesting that they might acquire MRSA colonization in the community rather than in the hospital. In addition, two other community clones, also belonging to ST59 linage, emerged and increased markedly during 2006\u20132007. It has been reported that community-associated MRSA strains spread into the hospital and even successfully replaced the original hospital strains [43],[44].
