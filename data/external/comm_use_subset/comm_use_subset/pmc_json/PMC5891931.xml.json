HS without mobile network coverage continued following the same procedures as the other regions of Madagascar. Within its goal of capacity reinforcement and fight against epidemics, the \u201cHealth watch\u201d (Veille Sanitaire) project of the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) has ensured continuation of this reinforced IDSR in the south. In 2013, data transfer by SMS was also introduced in the two regions in the southeast. Here, out of the 258 HS, 142 (55%) had access to the Airtel mobile phone network and were included.",

This does not seem to be related to the type of HS or training level of the responsible agent, even though the numbers might have been too small to detect a difference. The data quality problems are also related to points discussed under simplicity, notably lack of guidelines and training [10, 13].

Colleagues in Madagascar recently evaluated the national sentinel influenza surveillance system that includes 34 HS and is also based on SMS transmission of aggregated data.

Healthcare staff needs training on IDSR guidelines and case definitions. Since May 2016, data are collected and managed electronically in several pilot districts in Madagascar to reduce errors and improve the system\u2019s performance. Since April 2017, a weekly surveillance bulletin is circulated to central level, regional and district health offices. We hope this bulletin will also be accessible to the data providers, to show them the use and benefit of their IDSR-related work activities.",
