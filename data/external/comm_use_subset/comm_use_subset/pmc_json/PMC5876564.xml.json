            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. This enveloped RNA virus causes highly contagious viral enteritis in swine [1,2]. The virus was first identified in England in 1971 and then in other European countries [3]. From 1982, PEDV outbreaks were observed in Asian countries including Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, and China. Until 2009, PEDV strains in Asia were genotypically similar to those in Europe. Since 2010, however, PEDV has caused outbreaks in Asia with severe clinical signs and high mortality in suckling pigs, resulting in heavy economic losses to the pig farmers [3,4,5,6,7]. In May 2013, a PEDV strain, genetically related to a Chinese strain, was introduced in the US, possibly by importation of contaminated feed or contaminated feed tote bags [8,9]. The virus spread rapidly across the country causing high mortality in piglets [10]. Over eight million pigs were killed during this outbreak, leading to an estimated loss of 1.8 billion US dollars [11,12,13,14].",

            "text": "Transmission of PEDV primarily occurs by the fecal-oral route, but indirect transmission can occur when an animal comes in contact with inanimate objects (fomites) contaminated with the feces of PEDV-infected animals. Disease outbreaks primarily occur in early fall and winter, but the rationale for seasonality remains unclear [15]. Previous studies indicate that PEDV is stable at 50 \u00b0C and at pH between 7.2 and 10.2 [16,17,18,19]. A recent study found that the virus can survive for up to nine months at the center of manure lagoons [20]. We designed this study to evaluate the survival of PEDV on various fomite surfaces at both room temperature (RT) and 4 \u00b0C. Inanimate objects such as rubber boots, gloves, coveralls, and other equipment are routinely used on swine farms and have the potential of being contaminated with manure from PEDV infected animals, thereby helping the indirect mode of virus transmission.",

Materials used were Styrofoam, nitrile gloves, cardboard, aluminum foil, Tyvek\u00ae coveralls, cloth, metal, rubber, and plastic. Cell culture-grown stock virus was applied on each type of material contained in triplicate wells (200 \u03bcL of virus containing 2.1 \u00d7 106 TCID50/mL). Virus applied on the bottom of 24-well plate without any fomite material served as control. The applied virus was air dried for 2 h in a biosafety cabinet (BSC). Sets of virus-contaminated fomites were stored at either at room temperature (~25 \u00b0C) or at 4 \u00b0C. At various times thereafter (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days post application), the surviving virus was eluted from each material in 1 mL of 3% beef extract \u22120.05 M glycine buffer placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. After thorough mixing for 20 s on a vortexer (Scientific Industries Inc., Bohemia, NY, USA), the eluate was filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcM membrane filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) followed by virus titration on Vero cell monolayers. Virus stability on each fomite material was assessed as three independent replicates for all the time points tested. Separate fomite samples were used at every time point, and eluates were processed independently for quantification of infectious virus and viral RNA. To compare the survival of cell culture-adapted virus with that of virus contained in fecal material, a separate experiment was done. Fecal material obtained from PEDV negative pigs was spiked with 200 \u03bcL of cell culture propagated PEDV (2.1 \u00d7 106 TCID50/mL). After thorough mixing, contaminated fecal matter was applied in 200 \u03bcL amounts on fomite materials in triplicate.

The virus remained viable at 4 \u00b0C for up to 20-days on Styrofoam, metal, and plastic, although viral titers decreased by 3 logs in 20 days. When stored at RT, PEDV decreased by 4 to 5 logs within 48 h, rendering it undetectable using infectious virus assays. This observation suggests that the storage temperature of the fomite material has a major impact on virus stability. It appears that low storage temperature delays virus degradation on fomite material. Generally, enveloped viruses are more vulnerable to environmental conditions [22]. However, PEDV was found to have higher stability when stored in spray dried bovine plasma, being stable for up to 3 weeks at 4 \u00b0C, 2 weeks at 12 \u00b0C, and 1 week at 22 \u00b0C [18]. In addition, other coronaviruses, like transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), were also found to be more stable at 4 \u00b0C, surviving for as long as 28 days at 4 \u00b0C and up to 5 days at RT [23]. We demonstrated in this study that the infectious virus decay rate on all fomites increased rapidly at RT. This temperature-sensitive feature of PEDV may be applied to routine procedures in the farms to help eradicate PEDV in the environment and prevent transmission via fomites [16,24,25].",

The rate of loss in infectivity was uniform on Styrofoam, aluminum, plastic, and Tyvek\u00ae coverall, whereas viral infectivity on metal, nitrile gloves, and rubber dropped rapidly after 5 days at 4 \u00b0C.

The longer survival of the virus at cold temperatures may also explain the increase in outbreaks during the winter season [15]. Furthermore, enveloped viruses generally survive better in the presence of organic material [33].
