            "text": "The marine bacterial communities that regulate global carbon biogeochemical cycles are themselves structured by selective, phage-mediated lysis (Weinbauer, 2004; Suttle, 2007). Bacteria co-evolve with their phages and exchange genetic information, and phages even \u2018reprogram\u2019 hosts during infection so as to channel host metabolism towards phage replication (Forterre, 2013; Hurwitz, Hallam & Sullivan, 2013; Hurwitz & U\u2019Ren, 2016). Over the last decade, the convergence of high throughput sequencing and the use of universal taxonomic marker genes for bacteria have revolutionised our understanding of microbial ecology (Torsvik & Ovreaas, 2002; Treusch et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2017). Problematically, however, viral ecologists lack parallel approaches. First, PCR-amplified marker genes are limited to a narrow subset of the viral community, and require degeneracies and amplification conditions that undermine the quantitative nature of the data (Sullivan, 2015). Second, while short-read viral metagenomics studies to date have provided clues to viral function (e.g., virally encoded, host-derived central metabolism genes, known as Auxiliary Metabolic Genes: AMGs) (Breitbart et al., 2007; Hurwitz, Hallam & Sullivan, 2013), and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution (Brum et al., 2015; Roux et al., 2016a), they suffer from technical limitations. This is because short-read assemblies are composites of populations \u2018features\u2019 (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014), with successful assembly a function of coverage and branch resolution in assembly graphs (Temperton & Giovannoni, 2012; Olson et al., 2017). This limits our ability to assemble viral populations where multiple strains are abundant and microdiverse (Roux et al., 2017), as well as genomic regions of high diversity, such as genomic islands (GIs), which, in microbes, often contain niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation (Coleman et al., 2006). In these latter regions, assembly is impeded by low coverage and/or repeat regions at the boundaries (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014; Ashton et al., 2015).",

            "text": "These are not just technical limitations\u2014emerging data suggests that these obstacles alter our understanding of viral roles on important taxa and global carbon biogeochemistry. For example, the globally dominant members of the chemoheterotrophic order Pelagibacterales comprise up to 25% of all bacterioplankton and are major contributors in the conversion of marine dissolved organic matter back to atmospheric CO2 (Giovannoni, 2017). Their associated viruses dominate global oceans (Zhao et al., 2013; Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2018) and are likely to contribute significantly to carbon turnover in surface water by release of labile intracellular carbon during lysis (Suttle, 2005; Suttle, 2007). However, the genomes of viruses associated with Pelagibacterales contain numerous GIs and/or high microdiversity (Zhao et al., 2013; Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2018). Such features fragment genomes in short-read assemblies, which reduces representation following contig size-selection for downstream analyses (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2017; Roux et al., 2017). Though single-virus genomics (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2017) and fosmid-based approaches (Mizuno et al., 2013; Mizuno et al., 2016) can overcome such issues, these methods are technically challenging and costly to implement.",

Such approaches can yield very long reads (>800 kbp) (Jain et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2018; Loman, Quick & Simpson, 2015), which would be long enough to capture complete genomes of double-stranded DNA bacteriophages (\u2018phages\u2019) (10\u2013617.5 kbp (Mahmoudabadi & Phillips, 2018)). At a minimum, such long reads could span genomic global- and local repeat regions, which tangle the De Bruijn Graph and fragment the assembly (Koren & Phillippy, 2015). Long reads may also overcome assembly challenges in regions of low coverage, to improve overall assembly of genomes from both cultured isolates (Wick et al., 2017) and metagenomics (Frank et al., 2016; Driscoll et al., 2017). It is also probable that long-read assemblies using overlap-layout-consensus would be less prone to microdiversity-associated fragmentation of genomes observed in De Bruijn Graph approaches (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2017; Roux et al., 2017).",

Furthermore, PacBio subreads and nanopore reads have high error rates (5\u201310%), with the former enriched in insertion errors and the latter enriched in insertion-deletion errors (Weirather et al., 2017). Indel errors shift the reading frame of the DNA sequence and confound gene-calling algorithms, artificially inflating the number of identified stop codons and producing shorter gene calls (Warr & Watson, 2019). This is a particular problem for viral metagenomics as the median length of genes in dsDNA phages is approximately half that of their bacterial hosts (408 bp vs 801 bp, respectively) (Brocchieri & Karlin, 2005; Mahmoudabadi & Phillips, 2018), and the vast majority of viral genes in both dsDNA viral isolates and viral metagenomes (>50% and up to 93%, respectively) have no known function (Hurwitz & Sullivan, 2013; Mahmoudabadi & Phillips, 2018), making it difficult to evaluate the quality of gene calls from metagenomic assemblies.",

Briefly, long-read assembly contigs of VirION reads were \u2018polished\u2019 with matching short-read sequences to remove sequencing error via consensus base-calling (using Pilon; Walker et al., 2014, v1.22). In order to capture the longest assemblies available from the short-read data, scaffolds from short-read and hybrid assemblies were combined and dereplicated using a cut-off of 95% average nucleotide identity over 80% of the length (via MUMmer v3.23; Delcher, Salzberg & Phillippy, 2003) to cluster highly similar contigs into viral populations (Roux et al., 2016a). The longest representatives of each population were carried forward for analysis. Population representatives >10 kbp were pooled with polished long-read assembly contigs >10 kbp and evaluated with VirSorter (Roux et al., 2015) (in virome decontamination mode) to identify putative viral contigs. Reads classified as category 3 (deemed unusual, but not necessarily viral; Roux et al., 2015) were excluded from downstream analyses. Circular contigs (i.e., where the contig has matching ends) were identified by VirSorter and used as a proxy for successful assembly of a complete genome. Matching short-read data was then mapped against the representative viral population sequences (using bowtie2; Langmead & Salzberg, 2012) for use in evaluating (1) relative abundances of contigs; (2) whether long read assembly captured more microdiverse genomes; and (3) recovery of genomic islands and their predicted functional composition at the population level (see Supplemental Information).",

Western English Channel short-read data were sub-sampled to different sequencing depths, in triplicate; sub-samples were then mapped against the long-read assemblies of VirION reads. For error-correction with Pilon (Walker et al., 2014) and median coverage, the total number of fixed deletions and fixed insertions at each coverage depth were calculated. We then evaluated whether error-correction could be used to reduce the impact of frameshift errors on predicted gene length. Predicted coding sequences were identified using MetaGeneAnnotator (Noguchi, Taniguchi & Itoh, 2008) on the following: (1) uncorrected VirION reads; (2) long-read assemblies of VirION reads; (3) long-read assemblies of VirION reads polished with the full short-read dataset; (4) contigs from scaffolded short-read assemblies; (5) contigs from the hybrid assembly. Distributions of the lengths of predicted coding sequences were compared against those in the genomes of Caudovirales from the NCBI RefSeq database (v.8.4), predicted proteins from the Global Ocean Virome (GOV; Roux et al., 2016a), and the single-amplified viruses in Martinez-Hernandez et al. (2017). Effect size of different assembly types on genomic island length and density and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from bootstrapped medians (Cumming, 2014). For each bootstrap, 1000 predicted proteins were randomly subsampled from each dataset and their median length was calculated.",

Within this viral cluster, contig tig404, from the polished long-read assembly of VirION reads, was identified as a circular viral contig by VirSorter (Roux et al., 2015). Whole genome alignment was performed with MUmmer (Delcher, Salzberg & Phillippy, 2003) to calculate average nucleotide identity to HTVC010P. Contigs from short-read only and hybrid assemblies that shared 95% nucleotide identity over 80% of their length to tig404 were identified and mapped back to their respective loci with MUmmer (Delcher, Salzberg & Phillippy, 2003). Genomic islands and nucleotide diversity of tig404 were calculated as described previously. To evaluate the contents of a 5.3 kb genomic island, unpolished VirION reads were mapped back against the tig404 genome and those which mapped to at least 100 bp on the borders of the genomic island were extracted. Mapped reads extending at least 1 kb into the genomic island were used as a query in a tBLASTx best-BLAST (Camacho et al., 2009) search against the NCBI NR database to annotate the reads whilst minimising the adverse impact of sequencing error within the uncorrected reads.",

FastViromeExplorer is built upon the Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) framework and competitively recruits reads against contigs, allowing for accurate recruitment to contigs that may share a degree of sequence similarity. Briefly, high quality short read datasets from the Global Ocean Virome (Roux et al., 2016a) and from our Western English Channel sample were randomly subsampled to 10 million reads using seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) to standardise per-sample sequencing effort, with the number of reads selected to balance detection of lower abundance viral populations with maximising the number of samples that could be included in the survey. Subsampled reads for each sample were recruited against a Kallisto index comprising (1) The viral genomes >10 kbp identified in this study; (2) A selection of phage genomes >10 kbp from key metagenomic studies (Roux et al., 2016a; Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2017); (3) Cultured viruses from the NCBI RefSeq viral database (v8.4) (Table S2). Contigs >10 kbp were selected to maximise accuracy of VirSorter to correctly identify viral contigs (Roux et al., 2015). For inclusion in downstream abundance analyses, contigs with less than 40% coverage as calculated by FastViromeExplorer were classified as having zero abundance to avoid over-representation of partial matches (Tithi et al., 2018). The top 100 most abundant contigs from each sample were also selected for downstream analyses. All phage genomes >10 kbp (including those from RefSeq) were processed using VirSorter (v.1.03) on the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure (Merchant et al., 2016) to standardise gene-calling prior to clustering of viruses into ICTV-recognised genera by shared gene content using vContact2 (Bolduc et al., 2017). In the final stage of clustering, vContact2 uses ClusterONE (Nepusz, Yu & Paccanaro, 2012) and assigns a p-value to a cluster depending on whether the in-cluster edge weights are significantly higher than the out-cluster edge weights. Q-values were calculated from cluster p-values using the qvalue R package (Dabney, Storey & Warnes, 2015) to account for multiple testing and a q-value cutoff of <0.05 was used to identify statistically significant clusters.",

Considering viral DNA was sheared to 6\u20138 kbp fragments, the length of amplicons following LASL were shorter than expected, presumably due to preferential PCR amplification of shorter fragments (Shagin et al., 1999) (Fig. S1A) and preferential diffusion (and thus sequencing) of shorter reads within the flowcell microfluidics (Fig. S1B). Only 0.95% of LASL amplified reads were classified as chimeric (mapping to more than one location of the same or different genomes of the mock viral community), suggesting 15 rounds of PCR was sufficiently low to minimise production of chimeric artifacts, supporting previous findings (Laver et al., 2016). Several methods have been developed for sequencing dsDNA viral metagenomes without skewing relative abundance information important for comparative ecology, including an LASL approach optimised for 454 sequencing (Duhaime et al., 2012; Hurwitz et al., 2013) and Nextera sequencing (Roux et al., 2016b). Median per-genome coverages of VirION reads and short-read Nextera datasets (5.6 M 2 \u00d7 300 bp paired-end) from the mock viral community were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.975, p < 0.001, Fig. 3A), indicating that the LASL approach used here for multi-kilobasepair fragments retained relative abundance information observed in previous LASL approaches.",

Proteins predicted from uncorrected VirION reads (median length of 72 aa, 70\u201374 aa 95% CI) were shorter (median difference = 61 aa, 69\u201353 aa 95% CI) than those from RefSeq Caudovirales genomes (median length of 133 aa, 126\u2013141 aa 95% CI), and much shorter (median difference = 88 aa, 83\u201395 95% CI) than those from the GOV dataset (median length of 160 aa, 149\u2013173 95% CI). Assembly of long reads with Canu includes a consensus-based error-correction step (Koren et al., 2017), which increased median predicted protein lengths to 87 aa (median difference of 15 aa, 14\u201315 95%CI) compared to raw VirION reads. Polishing of long-read assemblies of VirION reads with short read data was highly effective in restoring the length of predicted proteins (median length 127 aa, 120\u2013135 aa 95%CI) to lengths similar to those observed in RefSeq Caudovirales (median length = 133 aa, 126\u2013141 aa 95%CI). Proteins from polished reads had a median difference of \u22126 aa (\u221218\u20136 95%CI) compared to RefSeq Caudovirales proteins. This suggests that not all frameshift errors were corrected in the long-read assemblies, corroborated by evidence of increased indel errors observed in long-read assemblies of mock viral community data compared to short-read assemblies.",

Genomic islands have also been found to be a common feature of viral genomes and are typically enriched in functions associated with host recognition (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014). At all nucleotide identity cut-offs tested, genomic islands captured on long-read assemblies were between 145 bp (112\u2013184 bp 95%CI) and 225 bp (189\u2013259 bp, 95% CI) longer than those captured on short-read only or hybrid assemblies. (Fig. 4A, Fig. S4A). There were no significant differences between the lengths of genomic islands captured on short-read only or hybrid assemblies. The largest genomic islands in each assembly type were 2.47 kbp, 5.75 kbp and 5.65 kbp in short-read only assemblies, hybrid assemblies and long-read assemblies, respectively. In comparison, the largest genomic islands identified in fosmid-based viral metagenomes were \u223c4.6 kbp (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014), suggesting that both hybrid and long-read approaches capture similar length genomic islands as previous fosmid-based methods. Similarly, the density of GIs was significantly greater in long-read assemblies (at between 40 bp (20\u201360 bp, 95%CI) and 100 bp (80\u2013110 bp, 95%CI) of GI per kbp of genome) compared to short-read or hybrid assemblies (Fig. 4B, Fig. S4B). Again, there was no significant difference between short-read only and hybrid assemblies. At a nucleotide identity cut-off of 98% for read mapping, the length of GIs in long-read assemblies were longer than those at 92% and 95%, (59 bp (18\u2013106 bp, 95%CI) and 61 bp (13\u2013105 bp, 95%CI) respectively), indicating that residual error in the polished reads may be contributing to a slight increase in predicted GI length and density at high nucleotide identity.

Here, we were able to gain further insight into viral genomic islands by investigating whether diversity also occurred at the functional level. VirION reads that spanned the full width of GIs were identified and their gene content was predicted at the nucleotide level.

Just 711 (15%) of aligned predicted proteins returned a hit with known function, indicating that genomic islands are an important source of \u2018genetic dark matter\u2019 (i.e., sequence of unknown function) in viral metagenomes (Krishnamurthy & Wang, 2017). In total 66 genomic islands contained genes with an assigned function. These islands captured a range of functional proteins including those associated with nucleotide biosynthesis; DNA methylation; redirection of host machinery; structural proteins and associated chaperonins; endo and exonucleases and integrases (Table S5). 35 of the genomic islands contained structural proteins (capsid, tail proteins, co-chaperonin GroES, YapH); proteins associated with membrane recognition (carbohydrate-binding module, lectin-binding proteins) or proteins associated with reconfiguring host metabolic machinery for viral synthesis or defence suppression (RNA polymerase sigma factor, methyltransferases, tRNA synthetases, anti-restriction protein), supporting the hypothesis that viral genomic islands are a hotspot for Constant-Diversity evolutionary dynamics (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014). Seven out of eight genomic islands containing a thymidylate synthase (an enzyme involved in pyrimidine metabolism) also encoded partial hits to ribonucleotide reductase (involved in both purine and pyrimidine metabolism). Ribonucleotide reductase has previously been identified as the nucleotide metabolism gene most frequently interrupted by self-splicing introns (Dwivedi et al., 2013). Similarly, thymidylate synthase has been found to contain self-splicing, group I introns in phage genomes (Chu et al., 1984; Bechhofer, Hue & Shub, 1994), potentially identifying intron splicing activity as a source of regulatory/functional variability and/or as a mechanism to promote the movement of genetic material within the viral genomic islands in our data. Functional, putatively niche-defining metabolic genes were also identified in the genomic islands, including an ultraviolet light damage repair gene uvsE and genes associated with photosystem II (psbA). Twenty-five out of the 66 genomic islands showed evidence of alternative gene arrangements across their spanning reads, suggesting the content of genomic islands can vary within viral populations at the structural, functional and nucleotide level.",

We evaluated genome-level nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) (Nei & Li, 1979) of both short-read assemblies and polished long-read assemblies from the Western English Channel virome. Median levels of \u03c0 were significantly (3-fold) higher in polished long-read contigs than those derived from De Bruijn Graph assemblies (two-sided Mann\u2013Whitney U test: W = 105,830, n\n1 = 758, n\n2 = 206, p = 4.81 \u00d7 10\u221215; Fig. S5), consistent with the hypothesis that long-read assembly of VirION reads captured genomes previously lost due to failure to resolve assembly graphs as a consequence of microdiversity.",

This ecologically important virus and its closely associated phages contain numerous genomic islands that comprise \u223c10% of their genome and a shared 5.3 kbp genomic island containing a putative ribonuclease, bounded by tail fibre proteins (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014). It has also been predicted to possess high microdiversity that challenges assembly from short-read data, leading to fragmentation and thus under-representation in short-read viral metagenomes, but is successfully captured using fosmid approaches and single-virus genomics (Mizuno et al., 2013; Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2017). Clustering of viral contigs from the WEC by shared-gene content using vContact2 (Bolduc et al., 2017) identified a virus called \u2018tig404\u2019 from long-read assembly of VirION reads that was 89% identical at the nucleotide level to HTVC010P. We mapped contigs from short-read only and hybrid assemblies against this genome at 95% nucleotide identity over 80% of the length to evaluate the success of short-read and hybrid assembly methods at capturing this genome, and identified its genomic islands as described above (Fig. 5). Both short-read only and hybrid assemblies were highly fragmented across the genome. Analysis of median nucleotide diversity of tig404 was extremely high (Fig. S5) and provided supporting evidence that fragmentation may be a result of high microdiversity in this phage. In contrast, VirION reads successfully overlapped across the genome and enabled recovery of the genome through long-read assembly. Comparison of the genome of tig404 with that of HTVC010P identified a shared genomic island containing a putative ribonuclease protein and bounded by a tail fibre protein (Fig. 5), similar to those observed in closely related taxa from fosmid libraries (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014).",

As each read is derived from a single DNA strand (excluding the low abundance of chimeric reads), variance in the content of the genomic island within a population would be captured on reads that align to the ends, or across, the genomic island. In total, 31 VirION reads extended from the boundaries into the genomic island (Fig. 5). Of these, 17 had sufficient overlap to use for identifying functional genes. Those at the 5\u2032 end of the genomic island all contained a putative ribonuclease, whilst those at the 3\u2032 end all contained an internal virion protein thought to be associated with puncturing the cell membrane in T7-like phages (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014). Thus, it would appear that, for this shared genomic island at the population level, diversity occurs at the nucleotide level, rather than gene content level. The fact that a similar gene content has now been found in the Western English Channel (this study), the Sargasso Sea (Zhao et al., 2013) and the Mediterranean (Mizuno, Ghai & Rodriguez-Valera, 2014) may indicate this is a conserved feature across the HTVC010P-like phages. The encoding of a ribonuclease within a genomic island offers an interesting glimpse into the host-virus interactions that occur during infection and suggests that degradation of RNA is an important feature of the arms-race in HTVC010P-like phages with their Pelagibacter hosts. Whether this is to shut down host metabolism, or to hijack host metabolism through manipulation of regulatory machinery enriched in riboswitches (Meyer et al., 2009) requires further investigation.",

Of these, 2,279 were from the de-replicated short and hybrid De Bruijn Graph assemblies and 366 from polished long-read assemblies. Our dataset represents the first virome sequenced from the WEC and so we evaluated the global abundance of viral populations from the WEC by competitive mapping of 10 million subsampled short reads from both the WEC and the GOV dataset (Roux et al., 2016a). Representatives of viral populations from the WEC were then pooled with those >10 kb from the GOV dataset and other marine virome datasets (Table S2) to make a total dataset of 20,545 viral contigs. Following competitive read recruitment with FastViromeExplorer (Tithi et al., 2018), the top 50 most abundant viral genomes were identified in each of the WEC and GOV surface samples. Out of 1,598 contigs, 81 of the most abundant viral contigs were from long read assemblies of VirION reads from the WEC, representing a significant enrichment (hypergeometric test for enrichment, p = 6.6 \u00d710\u221219). WEC contigs from short-read only (42 contigs) and hybrid assemblies (77 contigs) were not significantly enriched in the most abundant viral contigs. Thus, it is likely that long-read assembly of VirION reads from the WEC captured important and globally abundant viral taxa previously missed in the GOV datasets. Examination of relative abundance of WEC contigs in surface water samples from the GOV showed that contigs from long-read assemblies of VirION reads recruited a large proportion of the recruited reads from global samples, particularly in the Southern Atlantic Ocean and waters off the Western coasts of Southern Africa and South America (Fig. 6). In total, clustering VirION-derived contigs from the Western English Channel with contigs from previous studies (Table S2) by shared protein content produced 668 statistically supported viral clusters. Of these, 202 contained contigs derived from long-read assembly of VirION reads, but just three of these were comprised solely of these contigs. Thus, we are confident that previous findings suggesting viral diversity at the genera level in surface oceans has been largely documented (Roux et al., 2016a) are robust. Instead, we propose that long read assembly of VirION reads provides greater phylogenetic resolution of viral clusters by capturing members previously missed due to limitations in short-read assembly.",

Upon its discovery as the most abundant global virus we previously urged a cautious interpretation as any representative of a new viral clade will recruit reads from all similar viruses in the environment (Zhao et al., 2013).

This virus shared a viral cluster with the siphovirus Pseudoalteromonas phage vB_PspS-H6/1 but we were not able to determine its putative host despite using a variety of tools (Ahlgren et al., 2016; Galiez et al., 2017) (https://github.com/dutilh/CAT). A viral contig from hybrid assembly, denoted H_NODE_6 was the longest complete viral genome identified in this study, with a 316 kbp genome. In the short read-only assembly, this genome was broken into two contiguous contigs of 204 kbp and 112 kbp, respectively (Fig. S8). H_NODE_6 shared a viral cluster with the myoviruses Cronobacter sakasakii phage GAP32 and Enterobacter phage vB_KleM-RaK2. At 359 kb and 346 kb respectively (\u0160imoli\u016bnas et al., 2012; Abbasifar et al., 2014), these are some of the largest phage genomes ever isolated. Recovery of this complete genome demonstrates the capacity for hybrid assembly with VirION reads to capture complete genomes of very large phages from complex communities on single contigs, which were fragmented using short-read only assemblies.",

            "text": "In summary, this investigation represents the first use of long-read sequencing for viral metagenomics. We have shown that using long-reads to scaffold short read De Bruijn Graph assemblies improves recovery of complete viral genomes. Furthermore, overlap-layout consensus assembly of VirION reads, followed by error correction with short reads captures abundant and ubiquitous viral populations that are missed (possibly as a result of genome fragmentation) by current short-read metagenomic methods. By combining these two approaches, our proposed bioinformatics pipeline maximises the capture of viral diversity whilst minimising the impact of high error rates associated with long-read sequencing and represents a major addition to the viral metagenomics toolset. Improved capture of viral genomic islands will enable better understanding of mechanisms underpinning host\u2013virus interactions, as demonstrated in our capture of a shared genomic island on the newly observed HTVC010P-like pelagiphage tig404. Importantly, long-read sequencing on the MinION platform is undergoing rapid improvements in terms of yield, with current technology providing at least an order of magnitude more sequencing data than that produced in this study, at a cost of <$1000 per flowcell. Thus, our approach represents a significant advantage in terms of cost, yield and efficiency over fosmid and single-amplified genome approaches to capturing marine viruses that are otherwise challenging to assemble.",

A recent update to basecalling methods has led to a significant reduction in indel errors and their associated impact on protein prediction (Koren et al., 2019). Furthermore, there is no technical reason to prevent our VirION approach being used in conjunction with PacBio sequencing to further reduce error rates using circular consensus sequencing. Such an approach would remove the need for short-read error correction (Frank et al., 2016) and avoid the remaining indel errors observed following polishing of MinION read assemblies with short-read data. Reductions in DNA input requirements and/or improvements in DNA polymerases for increasing VirION amplicon lengths will further increase its utility in recovering viral genomes from metagenomic samples.",

Oxford Nanopore sequencing interprets single stranded nucleotides as they pass through the pore and there are significant efforts to develop protocols for direct sequencing of RNA, dsDNA and ssDNA viruses (Keller et al., 2018; Viehweger et al., 2018; McCabe et al., 2018). It is theoretically possible that with the right combination of ligases and optimised buffers, we will soon be able to sequence dsDNA, ssDNA and RNA viruses, with associated nucleotide modifications, within a single library preparation. We expect that the VirION approach could be readily adapted for use with ssDNA or RNA viruses, provided appropriate amplification of starting material could be achieved to meet the requirements for sequencing. Therefore, the approach described here provides a significant step towards capturing the full diversity of the viral community.",
