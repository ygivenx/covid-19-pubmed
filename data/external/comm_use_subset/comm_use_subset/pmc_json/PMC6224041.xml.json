We have therefore restricted the evaluation to a small, but still diverse subset of promising algorithms. These were derived from an analysis of successful applications within medicinal chemistry projects[5]. A comparison of web server-based tools became infeasible due to the number and size of analyzed data sets, so we restricted our evaluation to standalone tools. The methods analyzed herein and their fields of utilization are summarized in Table 1. Intriguingly, the success of nearly all of those studies resulted from the use of binding site comparison as part of a workflow combining different computational methods, e.g. MD simulations or molecular docking studies. A recent, impressive example shows that the combination of various tools of structure-based modeling and binding site comparison delivers insight into putative mechanisms of drug action[17].",

While most tools encode the binding site features based on the underlying ligand-interacting residues, other approaches use surface-based binding site representations, e.g. through a projection of physicochemical site features onto the respective surface patches. Probably the highest level of abstraction is achieved by programs that encode protein-ligand interactions, i.e. they do not depend on a distinct set of residue classes or functional groups, but on different types of interactions. While the residue type is crucial for most residue- and surface-based methods, interaction-based methods often rely on the nature of the bound ligand.",

This effect is most pronounced for binding site comparison tools that compare protein-ligand interactions. The interaction patterns of similar protein binding sites with different ligands strongly deviate from each other (Fig 3). An overview of the aligned protein-ligand complexes can be found in S1 Fig. IsoMIF and KRIPO clearly outperform Grim and TIFP. While the former solely rely on the ligand for the site definition, the latter derive interactions based on the bound molecules. Both methods are highly dependent on the ligand\u2019s size and its chemical nature. Interaction-based tools should therefore be used in combination with a large set of available protein-ligand structures. If the number of known complex structures is low, it may be useful to perform molecular docking studies for further known ligands and use the resultant binding poses for the comparison in addition to experimentally derived complex structures. Moreover, the use of \u201ccompound ligands\u201d might improve the results, i.e. using a number of ligands from different aligned structures for binding site definition. A similar approach was successfully applied in a study of binding site similarities[68], but was restricted to similar or identical ligands.

The ability of the applied scoring schemes to discriminate between active (i.e. similar) and inactive (i.e. dissimilar) cavity pairs was also analyzed using data set 1. This is vital to the application of binding site comparison methods. S3\u2013S5 Figs show box plots that illustrate the distribution of scores for similar and dissimilar site pairs. These plots might assist in distinguishing between similar and dissimilar binding site matches in a query-based comparison. The statistical data derived from the Welch\u2019s t-test are given in S4 Table and underline the utility of the different scoring schemes in delimiting similar and dissimilar sites. A clear score-dependent distinction between active and inactive pairs can be observed for the residue-based methods Cavbase, SiteAlign, and TM-align as well as for the surface-based methods ProBiS and SiteHopper. In the publication introducing SiteAlign reasonable cut-off distances for similar binding site pairs for the distance measures d1 and d2 are given[18]. The threshold for d2 (below 0.2) agrees with our data (S3 Fig) for distance d3 differing from d2 only in the center used for distance calculations. The distances between the upper and lower limits of the active and inactive pairs are high for SiteAlign, SMAP, TM-align, and SiteHopper compared to other tools. The structures in this data set are highly similar as the protein structures share the same sequence. Pairs of similar binding sites of unrelated structures will consequently result in lower scores. A large gap between the mean scores of active and inactive pairs is beneficial, as similar but not identical binding sites are likely to yield scores in between these mean values. Therefore, the box plots are useful to estimate meaningful score ranges for similar sites, but should never be misinterpreted as fixed score thresholds applicable for specific binding site comparison projects (see next Results section).",

In contrast, residue- and surface-based methods are the best choice for the elucidation of relationships between sites in complex with different ligands. The scoring metrics for most tools ensure a good discrimination between similar and dissimilar binding site pairs. Nevertheless, the use of fast and unspecific, but sensitive methods (RAPMAD, PocketMatch, FuzCav) should be avoided whenever possible.

The binding site RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) values are higher than for data set 1 (S2 and S5 Tables).

This result points toward a challenge concerning automated druggability estimation in combination with binding site flexibility, as already observed during the development of automated druggability prediction methods[72,73]. Following the introduction of the principle of binding site druggability[74], i.e. the potential of a cavity to accommodate drug-like small molecules leading to a modulation of protein function, different computational methods were developed for automated structure-based prediction of druggable binding sites[75]. VolSite initially calculates druggability scores for the binding sites of interest. If the score drops below a certain threshold the binding site is regarded as non-druggable. For non-druggable binding sites, no cavities are extracted for comparison purposes. Intriguingly, certain models of one solution NMR ensemble were predicted as druggable whereas others were predicted as non-druggable. This prevented the comparison for some binding site pairs (see failure rates in S10 Fig). The previously described sensitivity of binding site comparison tools toward binding site definition and flexibility also holds true for druggability prediction. Most computational druggability prediction methods are trained based on binding site descriptors, e.g. the hydrophobicity, the number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms, and various geometric properties. These characteristics fluctuate highly within the NMR ensembles (S6 Table).",

Again, the inclusion of various protein-ligand complexes for a cavity comparison with an interaction-based tool is essential for success. In particular, the results of IsoMIF are considerably affected by the binding sites\u2019 flexibility. In contrast, KRIPO, which considers the flexibility of binding sites by including fuzziness within the fingerprints, shows a more convincing performance.",

A clear differentiation between minor dissimilarities is an essential necessity for such analyses and the abovementioned tools might be helpful to reliably rank binding sites according to their similarities.

Fig 11 shows the binding site alignments for some high-scoring site pairs. The best-scored Cavbase match reflects an acceptable overlay of captopril bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme and leukotriene A4 hydrolase. The match between these binding sites was also the highest-scoring of all active pairs for TM-align. A good superposition of the bound identical ligands could be achieved. The second highest ranked true positive match yielded a superposition with poorly aligned ligands. The SMAP alignment of the class A pair with the highest score does not superpose the ligands in a satisfactory manner. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the tool was able to identify residue-based binding site similarities. A closer look shows that the residues taken into account for comparison are rather broadly distributed across the proteins providing a possible explanation for the unsatisfactory superposition. Only one significant (according to the expectation values) match was found by ProBiS for the binding sites of the abovementioned captopril binding proteins with a good agreement of the ligand atom positions in the alignment. Shaper-derived alignments also do not provide perfect alignments of ligand atoms for the best-scored hits, although ligand moieties with a similar physicochemical nature overlap. These results indicate that a visual inspection of the best ranked binding site pairs is a crucial step to assess the significance of the identified matches.

While the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of the binding sites in the benchmark set is higher than that for the sc-PDB[65] pockets, the number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms is lower. This underlines the finding that binding site similarity does not always imply a similar binding mode adopted by the ligands. For rather hydrophobic and aromatic ligands, multiple binding modes are possible irrespective of the underlying binding site alignment. Moreover, the generation of an accurate superposition is hampered by the fact that for highly hydrophobic binding sites a broad variety of acceptable cavity alignments can be obtained.

In contrast, this data is hard to extract for small molecule binding sites. The site of action of molecules with known bioactivities is often difficult to spot experimentally in bioassays. Especially enzyme activity assays provide no hints at the modulator\u2019s binding site.

The variation in the thresholds calculated for the seven data sets shows that they have to be carefully chosen dependent on the anticipated outcome. Similarity scoring for binding sites is an ambitious undertaking (see benchmark studies for data set 1). The reliability of the similarity measures varies with binding site flexibility, bound ligands, and the binding site definition. The development of meaningful benchmark data sets is challenging which is due to the lack of knowledge of site-specific bioactivities and the sparseness of known protein-ligand complex structures with similar ligands. Unfortunately, meaningful cut-offs cannot be determined before having even more protein ligand complex structures and bioactivity data with binding site annotations. In line with other investigations concerning this topic[11,43,89], we argue that these factors preclude the assignment of thresholds for a binary classification of similar and dissimilar binding site pairs.",

To this end, the box plots for the different methods (S3\u2013S5 Figs) were taken as a basis for the identification of \u201cdifficult cavity pairs\u201d. Active pairs with similarity or distance values in the range of dissimilar pairs for most methods were analyzed. The methods with the highest scores for these matches were applied to generate alignments of the pairs. Some of these are depicted in Fig 14. The general outcome of this analysis reveals the difficulties in finding similar pockets. The example in Fig 14A was first identified by the residue-based method Cavbase[35]. Intriguingly, a low Cavbase similarity score of 3.25 was assigned for this site pair in the present study. In contrast, the interaction-based method IsoMIF scored this pair highly and provided the presented site alignment. It is obvious that this match cannot be found by residue-based methods as the chemical nature of most aligned residues is different. Nevertheless, similarities were detected with respect to site interaction patterns. SiteAlign was applied for the identification of the match between synapsin and PIM-1 kinase[41]. In contrast to the previous example, SiteAlign assigns a high score to the match and it can be found within the best-scored pairs. A high ranking for this cavity pair was also observed for the surface-based method SiteEngine. The alignment in Fig 14B illustrates why it is so difficult for many methods to identify this similarity. Although the atoms of both ligands align as expected, residue correspondences are difficult to find and only sub-parts of both pockets are similar. This final analysis underlines that it is impossible to identify a \u201cbest-performing tool\u201d. Some of the similar cavity pairs were within the best-scored hits for one, but not all tools. The results of two or more tools are often complementary. This holds especially true for binding sites sharing common interaction patterns or surface properties which are not evident on a residue-based level.",

Nevertheless, it is possible to differentiate between very fast methods (several microseconds per comparison), moderately fast methods (several milliseconds per comparison), and comparably slow methods (several seconds per comparison). Depending on the desired outcome and the size of the data set, the computational cost might be a limiting factor and the use of some methods becomes infeasible. For a comparison of a single binding site of interest against all known pockets as stored in the sc-PDB[65] (9,283 entries) on a single CPU, three days will be necessary using SiteAlign while PocketMatch will perform these comparisons within 0.28 seconds. For an all-against-all comparison, RAPMAD is approximately 9,200 times faster than the graph-based method Cavbase. In contrast, TIFP is only twice as fast as the graph-based method Grim. Such minor differences suggest the use of the better-performing method. The run time also depends on the type of comparisons. Pairwise comparisons were performed for Grim, IsoMIF, VolSite/Shaper, SiteAlign, SMAP, TIFP, and TM-align, i.e. the tool was invoked for each comparison separately. This might become the time-limiting step for some methods. Cavbase, FuzCav, PocketMatch, ProBiS, RAPMAD, SiteEngine, and SiteHopper allow the comparison of one query against a list of targets in one run. This causes a speedup as the tool has to be invoked only once. For ProBiS, the conversion of PDB files to a surface file format is necessary. Thus the cavity preparation time reflects this preliminary step. Additionally, KRIPO and RAPMAD enable even faster comparisons by providing SQLite databases of the modeled sites and the automated calculation of similarity matrices. These factors illustrate the difficulty in analyzing and comparing run times. In this analysis, we chose the fastest option available for each tool. The computational cost will therefore differ depending on the tool\u2019s implementation and the type of approach employed (comparing distinct binding site pairs, query-based analyses, generation of distance matrices, etc.).",

S13 Table summarizes the tools\u2019 characteristics with respect to the most important criteria and provides a detailed assessment of the tools\u2019 performance. First of all, the necessary pre-processing of structures might have an impact on the choice. The preparation of large data sets, e.g. for the prediction of potential off-targets using all known binding sites, requires tools that enable an automated and flawless binding site processing and annotation. We divided this criterion into two parts. Firstly, it is important that binding sites can be prepared in an automated fashion. For example, the KRIPO developers generated scripts to automatically process the binding sites of interest. The same holds true for FuzCav, Grim, TIFP, Shaper, and VolSite/Shaper (although for some PDB structures ligand MOL2 templates have to be provided). Cavbase and RAPMAD require XML-formatted cavity descriptions as input which can be generated with the help of the CSD Python API[90] in an automated fashion. Secondly, the inclusion of all available binding sites might be crucial (S10 Fig). The prediction of potential off-targets and identification of novel binding sites require comprehensive cavity data sets. It is also vital that the chosen tools are reasonably fast with respect to such applications (run time).",

For these approaches they perform well as shown in the original publication[19] and quite recently for the D3R grand challenge 2015[97]. We could not use the pre-processed structures as stored in the sc-PDB[65] as our data sets make use of all available PDB structures. Restricting the binding site comparison with TIFP and Grim to sc-PDB derived structures might provide a different perspective for both tools as their performance depends highly on the pre-processing of the binding sites. Both tools assign interaction patterns depending on the nature of the ligand which impairs their success for some of our chosen data sets.

Often, score cut-off values have to be optimized for specific studies[11]. Our investigations also show the strong context dependency of such thresholds (S12 Table). If a clear classification of similar and dissimilar pairs is necessary, the appropriate cut-off has to be evaluated with a data set that reflects the main purpose of the analysis. Score thresholds for the decoy data sets (data set 3 and 4) should be taken into account if binding sites with minor dissimilarities are compared. In contrast to the elucidation of local binding site similarities or similarities of pockets of unrelated proteins, the less restrictive cut-offs determined for the data set of Kahraman and colleagues[63] or data set 7 are more appropriate. The methods SMAP and ProBiS offer additional statistical measures to estimate the significance of a binding site match.

Nevertheless, we wanted to give an example for guiding the way to the most appropriate tool according to the criteria selected. FuzCav seems to fulfil all criteria in the Venn diagram and can be safely applied for evolutionary analyses. However, the binding site matches cannot be visualized. Hence, the method is not suited for query-based drug repurposing projects which require a detailed examination of the identified similarities. The use of KRIPO enables the generation of site alignments, but the method is not applicable for predicted sites and consequently not suited for function prediction. ProBiS failed to rank the similarity according to the number of residue substitutions and will probably fail to accurately score minor cavity dissimilarities. As this is decisive in the analysis of evolutionary binding site relationships, such scenarios should be analyzed with SiteAlign, SiteEngine, or SMAP.

The embedding of a tool in an elaborate in silico workflow might serve to diminish certain weaknesses.

The impact of the ease and completeness of binding site pre-processing steps increases with an increasing number of proteins used for comparison. While both factors are crucial for elaborate projects, e.g. off-target prediction or the identification of novel binding sites, their importance decreases for relatively small data sets used in selectivity profiling or polypharmacology prediction. An application to predicted binding sites is relevant for off-target prediction, drug repurposing, or the identification of potential targets. For polypharmacology elucidation, one generally refers to known druggable binding sites. The analysis of similar binding sites to elucidate minor structural differences is highly influenced by the binding site\u2019s definition and flexibility, as is the ranking with respect to binding site properties. In contrast, the elucidation of similarities between the cavities of unrelated proteins does not necessarily depend on accurate scoring. MD simulations or the use of NMR ensembles might help to circumvent a potential failure of binding site comparison due to insufficient consideration of protein flexibility. It is necessary to unravel the similarity between functionally unrelated binding sites which bind similar ligands when understanding polypharmacology. Visualization of identified similarities, which is essential when dealing with non-obvious similarities, is not necessarily crucial for selectivity profiling or analyzing evolutionary relationships. These criteria should become the focus of future benchmark analyses of other promising site comparison approaches as such analyses can guide the rational choice of a method.",
