Exposure was defined as caring of or being in close proximity (within 2 meters) of a confirmed patient, without proper personal protective equipment (PPE).",

MERS-Cov confirmation was roughly similar among symptomatic (3/328, 0.91%) and asymptomatic (11/1033, 1.06%) HCWs. Only 2 (14.3%) of the 14 confirmed HCWs required hospitalization.
