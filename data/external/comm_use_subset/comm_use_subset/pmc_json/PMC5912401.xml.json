Dental practitioners treat a wide range of patients. Therefore, it is likely that they will have contact with people colonized or infected with drug-resistant microorganisms\n4\n. High resistance rates against the antibiotics used for prophylaxis in Dentistry have been detected for pathogens associated with bacterial endocarditis such as S. aureus\n\n19\n. S. aureus strains can be disseminated during dental treatments and occasionally lead to the contamination and infection of patients and dentists\n24\n. Certain aspects of practicing Dentistry may contribute to the transmission of microorganisms. Skin, environment, and instruments can be contaminated with saliva, blood, or organic debris during routine dental treatment\n29\n. Several investigators have observed an increase in the amount of microorganisms during clinical procedures in a dental environment, suggesting contamination from aerosols and especially when high-speed handpieces or ultrasonic scalers are used\n1\n\n,\n\n20\n. Among the species identified by microbiological studies, Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus spp. are the most prevalent microorganisms found on the surfaces of dental equipment\n12\n, which includes the methicillin-resistant S. aureus that has been detected on the surfaces of dental operatories, air-water syringes, and reclining chairs\n18\n.",

MLEE has been used for several decades as a standard method in eukaryotic population genetics and systematics\n26\n as well as in large-scale studies to estimate the genetic diversity and structure in natural populations of a variety of bacterial\n23\n, fungal, and yeast\n3\n species. Its special advantage is that mobility variants (electromorphs or allozymes) of an enzyme can be directly equated with alleles at the corresponding structural gene loci. Another attractive feature is the likelihood that much of the electrophoretically demonstrable polymorphic variation in enzymes is selectively neutral or nearly so and, therefore, minimally subjected to evolutionary convergence\n2\n\n,\n\n28\n. The genetic interpretation of patterns depends on the ploidy of the organism, and different rules have to be applied for haploid and diploid organisms\n2\n\n,\n\n28\n. Based on these rules, the allelic makeup of each isolate is determined over the set of different enzymes studied (between 10 and 30). The enzymes examined in MLEE typically participate in the basic metabolism of the cell and are less likely than other loci to be under selective pressure from the environment or to be subjected to convergence\n2\n. Therefore, MLEE data are considered representative of the whole genome of an organism and form a good basis for population genetic studies of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa\n2\n. The genetic data obtained by MLEE can be used for a variety of purposes in the medical microbiology field: (i) to infer the degree of genetic recombination occurring within a natural population, (ii) to assess the degree of genetic isolation of natural populations, either for geographical and ecological reasons or because of biological barriers, (iii) to assess the degree of genetic relatedness between organisms or populations, and thus, provide systematic and taxonomic implications, (iv) to identify bacterial clones within species that can be associated with particular clinical patterns, with a particular frequency in clinical diseases or with a higher level of pathogenicity, and (v) epidemiological tracing of microorganisms. This method represents an invaluable complement to the most recent molecular typing methods, particularly for large-scale epidemiological studies\n2\n. In addition, MLEE possesses an excellent typeability (i.e., the percentage of distinct strains obtained), excellent reproducibility (i.e., the percentage of strains that show the same results in repeated assays), and good discriminatory power (i.e., its ability to differentiate unrelated strains)\n2\n\n,\n\n3\n.",

The possible reasons for their existence have been the object of a long debate in population genetics and molecular evolution\n10\n\n,\n\n11\n. S. aureus is a heterogeneous (polymorphic) species\n8\n that has a clonal population structure\n6\n. Therefore, it is believed that S. aureus does not undergo extensive recombination, diversifies largely by nucleotide mutations, and displays a high degree of linkage disequilibrium (nonrandom associations between genetic loci). A certain structural genetic locus is defined as polymorphic when the frequency of its most common allele presents a value below 0.99 (99%). Some of the measurements used to quantify this variability in organism populations are the gene and allele frequencies, the polymorphic loci percentage, the average number of alleles per locus, the average number of alleles per polymorphic locus, and the heterozygosity\n14\n. In this study, quantitative and qualitative variations of the polymorphic loci (12 85.7% enzymatic loci polymorphic for two, three, four, and five alleles), the average number of alleles per locus (2.57) and the average number of alleles per polymorphic locus (2.83) were observed in S. aureus population isolated from dental clinic environments (air). These variations have been observed in several genetic diversity studies of S. aureus populations recovered from human and bovine sources\n7\n\n,\n\n8\n\n,\n\n17\n\n,\n\n22\n. In addition, the genetic polymorphisms found among S. aureus isolates revealed a polyclonal pattern for air dispersion over time. However, monoclonal air dispersion was also observed for some of the isolates (isolates 9 ET15 and 10 ET15, 42ET1 and 43ET1, 36 ET11 and 38 ET11, 28 ET16 and 29 ET16, 5 ET20 and 6 ET20, 35 ET8 and 37 ET8) and for some of the periods of time, ranging from <1 to \u00b17 months (isolates 42 ET1, 43 ET1 and 44 ET1 for <1 month, isolates 17 ET10 and 18 ET10 for <1 month, isolates 3 ET17, 7 ET17 and 20 ET17 for \u00b17 months, and isolates 34 ET22 and 39 ET22 for \u00b12 months).",

A high degree of genetic polymorphism (0.000\u2264dij<0.184) was found among the clinical isolates (i.e., on average, from zero to 18.4 allelic substitutions were detected in every 100 loci from a common ancestral strain). Such isolates were distributed into five taxa (A to E), which established a genetic distance of 0.063\u2264dij<0.184. Taxon A contained a larger number of isolates, strains or bacterial clusters (29 isolates 65.9%, 20 ETs 60.6%, and 4 clusters I,II,III and VI), followed by taxon B (7 isolates 15.9%, 6 ETs 18.2%, and 2 clusters V and VI), taxon C (4 isolates 9.1%, 4 ETs 12.1%, and 1 cluster VI), taxon D (3 isolates 6.8%, 2 ETs 6.1%, and 1 cluster VIII), and taxon E (1 isolate 2.3% and 1 ET 3%). Each taxon contained one or more moderately related clusters and/or isolates (0.025\u2264dij<0.063). In turn, these clusters harbored two or more highly related isolates (0\u2264dij<0.025). These results reinforce the hypothesis that S. aureus is dispersed in clinical microenvironments (multi-user and urgency clinics and sterilization sectors) following both monoclonal and polyclonal patterns during a certain period and/or re-emerging temporarily. However, when considering that highly related strains come from a common ancestor [i.e., descendants have undergone microevolution and adaptations as a consequence of recombination (not extensive), nucleotide mutations, and nonrandom associations between genetic loci (linkage disequilibrium)\n6\n\n,\n\n8\n], these data also suggest the possibility of microevolutionary processes in S. aureus populations, as demonstrated in each cluster (i.e., on average, from zero to 2.5 allelic substitutions were detected in every 100 loci from a common ancestral strain) from \u00b11 to \u00b114 months.

The high frequency of identical or highly related strains in the air of different environments might be due to the intense traffic of carriers such as students, assistants or professors. On the other hand, the relatively low frequency of S. aureus strains can be explained by the admission of new students/patients, which only reside in clinical environments for short periods of time. In addition, no correlation was observed between S. aureus strains (or clusters) and virulence characteristics, such as the production of \u03b2-lactamase and resistance to ampicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline.",

In the dental environment, investigators have observed an increase in the amount of microorganisms during clinical procedures, suggesting contamination by aerosols, especially when high-speed handpieces or ultrasonic scalers are used\n1\n\n,\n\n20\n. Among the species identified in microbiological studies, Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus spp. are the most prevalent microorganisms found on the surfaces of dental equipment\n1\n\n,\n\n12\n\n,\n\n20\n. In addition, the high-speed drills and cavitrons used in dental offices generate aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with blood and bacteria and may be a route for the transmission of diseases, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), tuberculosis, and Legionnaires' disease\n13\n\n,\n\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has frequently been detected on surfaces in dental operatories, including the air-water syringe and reclining chair\n18\n. Nosocomial infections or the colonization of MRSA occurred in eight out of 140 patients who showed no evidence of MRSA upon admission to a clinic. Antibiogram tests revealed that the isolates from the eight patients were of the same strain as those from the surfaces of the dental operatory, suggesting S. aureus transmission between the patients and the dentist via the clinical environment\n18\n. Beyond their resistances to antimicrobial agents, S. aureus strains have the capacity to survive on dry surfaces for an average of 5 days\n9\n. Recently, the frequency of S. aureus isolated from the noses, hands, and tongues of students and patients and from the clinical environment of a pediatric Dentistry clinic before and after dental treatment was determined\n24\n. The highest concentration of S. aureus was found in the noses and on the tongues of children and among the dental students, and the highest level of contamination was observed on gloved hands, which was followed by the tongue and hands without gloves before clinical care. At the end of dental treatment, S. aureus colonies isolated from the gloved hands of students decreased significantly. Considering the clinical environment, S. aureus dissemination increased at the end of dental procedures, and the most contaminated areas were the auxiliary table and the storeroom, which was located at the center of the clinic. Such results can be explained by the intense circulation of people in the clinic and the use of high-speed dental handpieces. However, it is still speculated that much of the S. aureus contamination detected in the clinical environment came from other sources, such as direct contact, skin exfoliation or the improper handling of plates, and it is concluded that the dental clinic is an appropriate environment for S. aureus cross-transmission.",

Immediately after inoculation, only 0.16% of the cells survived. The number of viable cells decreased further to 0.046% after 1 h and to 0.014% after 24 h. To explore the capacity of bacteria to transfer from a white coat to another surface, the number of viable bacteria following a transfer to a stainless steel disc was also determined\n30\n. The number of recovered cells after contacting the stainless steel surface was not significantly different from the number before the contact, regardless of the dryness of the coat. Even airborne transfers of bacteria by moving contaminated pieces of white coat over agar plates in a disinfected laminar flow cabinet revealed a comparably low recovery of pathogenic bacteria after a direct recovery from the fabric\n30\n. The use of white coats in dental and medical clinics has been a common practice to prevent the contamination of healthcare workers by the pathogenic microorganisms found on patients or vice versa. It is well known that aerosols of oral secretions are frequently produced during dental interventions and that these secretions contain large numbers of microorganisms\n27\n.",

The results demonstrated the presence of streptococci (100%), staphylococci (65.4%), Candida (46.2%), methicillin-resistance S. aureus (MRSA) (15.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.7%) on the impressions and the gypsum casts. Only 54% of the general dentists had a cross-infection policy in their dental clinics, and only 30% to 40% were aware of the possible persistence of MRSA or P. aeruginosa on impressions and gypsum casts. This knowledge confirmed the need for dental clinics to use appropriate infection control procedures and to prevent the possibility of cross-contamination, which results in infections by opportunistic pathogens, among patients and dental office and laboratory personnel\n5\n.",

Finally, the MLEE method associated with genetic and clustering analysis allowed to identify a high degree of genetic polymorphism among S. aureus isolates, mono- and polyclonality patterns (bacterial strains dispersion in air environment of the academic dental clinic over time), taxa and clusters displaying variable frequencies of strains and possibly microevolutionary changes.",
