When DNA was discovered to be the material basis of inheritance in all organisms, it was thought that the DNA content of an organism should correlate with its phenotypic complexity, but soon thereafter the C-value paradox was found. C-value refers to the amount of DNA contained within a haploid nucleus, and usually equals to genome size. Salamanders and lungfishes have the largest genomes of 120pg, while the C-value of humans is only 3.5pg [1]. C-values vary enormously among species. In animals they range more than 3,300-fold. Variation in C-values bears no relationship to the complexity of the organism. The discovery of non-coding DNA in the early 1970 s resolved the C-value paradox. Although it is still unclear why some species have a remarkably higher amount of non-coding sequences than others of the same level of complexity, it was believed that the number of genes contained in the genome, rather than the genome size, correlated with the complexity of the organism. However, the human genome project and other model organism genome projects revealed that there are only about 25,000 genes in the human genome [2], while simple organism nematode have 19,500 genes [3] and rice even has more genes than humans, 46,000~55,000 [4]. Obviously, the number of genes bears no direct relationship to phenotypic complexity. This is called G-value paradox.",

            "text": "As proteins are the ultimate bearers of organismal structure and function, it is now believed that the diversity of proteins as well as the interactions between the proteins correlates with the phenotypic complexity. The study of proteomics proceeds extensively after the genome projects. However, proteins are different from nucleic acids. Many proteins are subjected to a wide variety of chemical modifications after translation. A lot of these post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, oxidation, nitrosylation and protein splicing, are critical to the protein functions. The modified proteins display different physical and chemical properties and biological functions from the unmodified. If a modified protein can be seen as a new protein, then the size of the proteome would be much larger than the number of genes. The number of proteins in a living organism may never be accurately counted as the number of genes, because every modified protein can only be individually studied. That is technically much more difficult because different proteins have different properties. A proteomic study can become quite complex even if the object of the study is very restricted. Therefore, it seems difficult to calculate the phenotypic complexity of an organism at least at the present time.",

            "text": "There are some studies about the problem of biological complexity. The traditional mathematical notion of complexity is Kolmogorov complexity, which can be thought of as the length of the shortest message in which the given sequence can be encoded [5]. The complexity is minimal for a homopolymer, and is maximal for a random sequence, in which case complexity is equal to the sequence length. The later case means the sequence cannot be simplified at all, so is the most complex. However, Kolmogorov complexity does not correspond to our intuitive notion of biological complexity. The other complexity is to calculate the Shannon's information entropy of a sequence [5-8]. The complexity is the length of the sequence subtracting the Shannon's entropy, and is actually the information content of the sequence. This kind of complexity has biological meaning. The more complex means the sequence is more conserved and therefore carries more information. However, this complexity is only the complexity of sequences, which has nothing to do with the phenotypic complexity of organisms.",

Here we take the amount of minimal information needed to construct an organism as a measure of organism phenotypic complexity because apparently more complex organisms should need more minimal information to construct and simple organisms are supposed to need less information to construct. The information to constitute DNA structure is relatively simple and less important, and we know very little about the mechanisms of evolution, so for the purpose of this article we will not be considering these areas of information. The information needed to construct organism, to put it simply, is the information needed to express proteins in time, in space, and in quantity. We actually still know very little about this information up to now. The conserved gene coding sequences are only part of the information. To calculate this information, we need to construct organism mathematically using permutation and combination formulas based on the numbers of proteins and cell types.",

For example, proline has 4 codons and the third base pair of the codons is wobbled, the information content of proline C=Hmax-Hknown=6-2 = 4 bits. In the same way, the information content of Arg is 3 bits, of Asn is 5 bits, and of Trp is 6 bits. Organisms probably know the importance of each amino acid and how to regulate gene expressions with codon bias, and evolved this codon system to regulate translation efficiently and reduce the harm of mutation of important amino acids. The redundance of information is R=I-C. The less the information content is, the more the redundance of information, the more the space to silence or neutralize mutation. So Arg is more important, more protected from mutation, and more expression regulated than Trp. Although some amino acids may need less information to be encoded (for example, 2 base pairs for the amino acids with information content less than 4 bits), organisms actually use 3 base pairs for every amino acid, so it cost organisms 6 bits genomic information to encode every amino acid.

Otherwise, organisms have to change the codon system when the distributions change. For evolution, it is impossible for a living organism to know the future protein sequences and the amino acid distributions across the sequences. In order to generate any unknown future sequences efficiently, living organisms need to use a mechanism that can encode any protein sequences efficiently. In fact, all organisms use a mechanism that can reduce the maximal entropy to 0, which means equal probability for all amino acids when encoding protein sequences. For the same reason, organisms may not know the distribution of bases across all nucleotide sequences, and may assume equal probability for all bases even though the actual probability distribution across some genomes may not be equal at all.

For example, sequences AACCC and CCCGG have overlapping part CCC. The information of the first sequence is 5 2 = 10 bits.

The phenotypic complexity of an organism is a measure of uncertainty associated with the size of the genome sequence, and is mathematically defined as the information entropy of the system. The amount of effective genomic information needed to produce a gene/protein sequences from a random sequence is at least the information entropy. The approach uses permutation and combination formulas to model the information needed to encode proteins for simple organisms like viruses, bacteria and other single celled organisms; and also extends the method to compute the information needed to produce differentiated cells and to construct spatial structures formed by the cells in higher organisms. The approach is not without interest, but several questions need to be addressed.",

It would be helpful if this equality may be explained. This paragraph, as many others, suffers from simplistic explanation of biological phenomena. In p.4:\\...there are no regulations of quantity of gene products. Viruses only need to produce their proteins one by one in order.\" - this is not true, most if not all viruses have elaborate mechanisms of, e.g., separating the expression of early and late proteins; of maintaining quite precise ratios of different protein products expressed simultaneously; etc. Many of these processes require action of virus-encoded signals and cellular proteins. But is this relevant for computing complexity? in p. 5:\\In fact, mutations are not normally allowed for a real protein sequence\" - not true, viruses are notorious for rapid evolution that is facilitated, in the case of RNA viruses, by a particularly high mutation rate (but again, is this information even needed for what authors are proposing?).

For the three organisms (viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes) considered in the paper, the effective information is shown to be increasing in the order from virus to bacteria and to eukaryotes. What the authors had done is to use Sharron's information entropies to represent genotypic complexity on the three organisms but failed to demonstrate the relevance of this information to the evolution of phenotypic complexity.

Some formality on how these equations are derived should be presented.

A biologist may argue that there is always an increase in complexity if one follows the simple dictum that eggs come from preexisting eggs and multicellular organism evolves from single cell animals. Questions can then be raised if viruses are therefore more primitive than rickettsiae, bacteria, fungi, algae, plants or animals. Indeed, a single cell alga is more complex than bacteria. Can gastrula be more advanced than a parasite in the gut of a termite? Can an organism like a viroid more primitive than free living algae?
