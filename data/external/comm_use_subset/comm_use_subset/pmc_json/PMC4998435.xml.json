Hyperuricemia causes uric acid crystals to deposit in the joints and kidneys, and consequently causes gout and chronic interstitial nephritis. Moreover, increasing data suggest that a higher serum uric acid (SUA) level may be a risk factor or biomarker for both renal and cardiovascular outcomes in a range of populations. In the general population, a higher SUA level is linked to the development of new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD)[2\u20134] and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).[5,6] In addition, an elevation of SUA level has been shown to be associated with hypertension,[7] diabetes mellitus (DM), metabolic syndrome, coronary disease,[8] and even cardiovascular mortality.[8\u201310]",

In humans, two-third of the uric acid produced is eliminated in the urine. Therefore, the SUA concentration is determined by both the rate of purine metabolism and the efficiency of renal clearance. Consequently, an elevation of the SUA level is highly prevalent in patients with CKD.[11,12] This makes it difficult to determine a causal or coincidental relationship between the SUA level and outcome in the CKD population compared with the general population. Previous studies on the effect of the SUA level on either a decline in renal function or cardiovascular disease have controversial findings.[13\u201315] Additionally, higher SUA levels have been reported to be associated with increased[16,17] or neutral effects[18] on mortality in patients with CKD. Regarding the patients with ESRD, the impact of SUA level on their mortality remains more obscure. In patients on hemodialysis (HD), a J-shaped relationship between the SUA level and mortality has been suggested,[19] whereas several studies have demonstrated that hyperuricemia is protective against mortality[20,21] and cardiovascular events.[22] In peritoneal dialysis, a higher SUA level was found to be harmful in residual renal function,[23] endothelial dysfunction,[24] and cardiovascular events and mortality.[25,26] However, most of these previous studies were retrospective, single-center trials with a single measurement from small population size.",

To prove this hypothesis, we explored the association between the SUA level and mortality in patients with ESRD by using a nationwide representative prospective ESRD cohort in Korea.

The dialysis duration was defined as the duration of time between the dialysis initiation date and the patient enrollment date, which was calculated in months. To exclude any medication effect on SUA levels, we gathered information about uricosuric and antiuricosuric drugs. For uricosuric agents, losartan and calcium channel blocking antihypertensive medications were included. In addition, we obtained concomitant use of aspirin, angiotensin receptor blockades except losartan, angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitors, and \u03b2-blockers and diuretics as antiuricosuric agents.",

The SGA includes 6 subjective assessments: 5 based on the patient's history of weight change, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional impairment, and comorbidities as related to his or her nutritional needs; and 1 based on the physical examination of loss of subcutaneous fat, muscle wasting, ankle edema, sacral edema, and ascites. Each assessment was given a score of 1 to 7, indicating well nourished (6\u20137), mild to moderately malnourished (3\u20136), and severely malnourished (1\u20132). Second, we collected laboratory data such as the plasma hemoglobin, serum creatinine, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, and highly sensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels.

A recent study clarified the association between SUA levels and the nutritional status in patients on HD.[34] Therefore, nutritional markers should be finely adjusted to demonstrate the independent prognostic value of SUA on mortality in patients with ESRD. In our prospective study, we considered all possible nutritional factors, including the SGA, BMI, serum albumin, and phosphorus levels. BMI is a paradoxical variable for mortality in patients with ESRD.[40] Hypoalbuminemia is also well established as a potent independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients on dialysis.[41] Aside from laboratory markers, we also considered the SGA, which represents the overall concepts of nutritional factors such as the subjects\u2019 recent weight change, dietary intake, and gastrointestinal symptoms, loss of subcutaneous fat, and signs of muscle wasting.[42] In patients with ESRD, the SGA was an independent predictor for mortality in a large longitudinal cohort study.[43] In our subgroup analyses, an independent role of the lowest SUA level on elevated mortality was prominent in the well-nourished (on SGA), higher BMI, and higher serum albumin level group than each counterpart. This implies that the SUA level is not a simple marker that reflects the nutritional status of patients with chronic dialysis.",

            "text": "Another important issue to address is that both hyper- and hypouricemia can be associated with an increased mortality. Two previous studies on patients on PD illustrated this common concept by showing that hyperuricemia was associated with an increased all-cause, especially cardiovascular mortality.[25,26] However, 1 study enrolled patients with a relatively young age and fewer comorbidities compared with our cohort.[26] The other study had some limitations, including a small sample size and short follow-up duration.[25] Our study participants were observed prospectively at nationally distributed multicenters, and therefore they are representative of real-world patients with chronic dialysis. Our study demonstrated that a lower TA-SUA level increased the all-cause mortality in patients with chronic dialysis. The SUA is a powerful scavenger for oxygen-free radicals and acts as one of the most important antioxidants in human biological fluids.[27,44] There is enough evidence that a lower SUA level is associated with inflammatory and degenerative diseases.[22,29,45\u201348] In patients on dialysis, it was found that the total antioxidant capacity was correlated with SUA levels due to primarily higher levels of SUA.[49] Therefore, it is possible that a lower SUA level results in a reduced total antioxidant capacity in patients on dialysis, although further investigations are warranted to clarify the precise mechanisms.",

Since this study had a prospective cohort design, we did not obtain this information at the time of the study design. Although we could not gather the medication for gout treatment, but we could adjust gout history, uricosuric agents, and antiuricosuric agents. Even after adjusted the gout and drugs affecting SUA levels, the TA-SUA <5.5 mg/dL was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality. Second, we also could not consider the other antioxidative parameters that may provide one of the relationships between SUA and antioxidant capacity. Among the usual laboratory tests, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have been considered markers of oxidative stress. Some of our collaborators have already demonstrated that high serum GGT levels were an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in PD patients by using the same cohort.[50] Unfortunately, serum GGT levels were collected in only 836 (39.7%) patients of our cohort, so we could not include serum GGT levels as a covariate in our regression analysis. Furthermore, total bilirubin levels were not collected in this prospective cohort. Further translational research may be warranted to demonstrate the precise antioxidative effect of SUA on mortality.",
