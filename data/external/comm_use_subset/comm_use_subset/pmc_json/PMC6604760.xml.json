In 2013, the first outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in the U.S. shook the industry both economically and socially, and required us to rethink effective disease-prevention strategies (1, 2). PEDv is now an endemic disease and it is one of the most severe infectious diseases in the hog industry with ~80\u2013100% morbidity and 50\u201390% mortality in suckling piglets (3, 4). The virus can spread via direct, indirect and possibly airborne transmission mechanisms (5\u201312). Direct transmission involves animal-to-animal contact while indirect transmission implies exposure to contaminated fomites. Furthermore, both animal and environment can be reservoirs of the virus for long periods, making it difficult to predict the time and place of new outbreaks (13). There is no single successful control strategy for PEDv, in part because of the complexity and large size of the swine population, but also because of poorly-understood transmission vectors, including inconsistent, and occasionally-irrational behavior by humans in the industry. Thus, one aspect of the problem has become clear: livestock disease spread is not only epidemiological but also a matter of human behavior, specifically the choices producers make to implement biosecurity protocols or not (14).",

The data also exhibit seasonal cycles with winter seasons generally carrying higher PEDv incidence. While there are likely a number of factors influencing the variability in the data, we became interested in the steady decreasing trend. Since the pathways of virus transmission have stayed the same through time, why has incidence decreased? Likely, this is evidence of a change in the response to disease within the production system. We therefore investigate how shifts in human behaviors and risk mitigation strategies longitudinally affect contagion dynamics.",

Biosecurity practices such as disinfecting footwear, showering and wearing clean clothes before entering production premises, vehicle washing and disinfecting can be employed to mitigate PEDv transmission both within and between farms (15\u201317). Although producers have access to biosecurity information and implementation instructions, their risk attitude can influence the willingness to comply with biosecurity protocols (18, 19). Hereafter, we refer to this operational willingness to obey the rules as \u201ccompliance\u201d with biosecurity protocols. Failure to comply with biosecurity practices can lead to infection, increased mortality of pigs of all ages and economic losses for the farm. A second aspect of biosecurity is the willingness by managers and owners to invest in biosecurity, for example purchasing truck-washing equipment or installing air-filtration systems. For this reason, human decision-making factors, in addition to epidemiological factors, are essential pieces needed to understand disease dynamics and their associated economic repercussions (20).",

At the forefront of disease prevention are people involved with daily on-farm practices or decisions regarding the biosecurity standards on a farm. However, not everybody perceives disease risk in the same way (20, 22) and biosecurity practices are not applied homogenously and at the same level across farms (23, 24). Critical research on human decision-making shows that behaviors are not immutable and can be nudged toward standards that are more beneficial both for the individual and the larger community (25). In the case of disease for example, both the producer and the production system can benefit from improved disease control by shifting individual producers' behaviors toward higher biosecurity engagement (20). The integration of epidemiological and social disciplines can provide insights (26) on the effect of shifts in human behavior directed at protecting farms from disease incursions.",

            "text": "Agent-Based Models (ABMs) have been applied to study social phenomena and analyze macroscopic patterns that emerge from the interaction of a number of agents programmed to behave according to specified rules (31, 32). ABMs are computational models that attempt to capture the behavior of autonomous agents within their environment. An ABM usually consists of: (1) Agents, which represent actors characterized by attributes and behaviors; (2) Agent relationships and functions for their interactions and; (3) an environment in which the agents are embedded and with which they can interact. Sometimes agents can be part of a population and share characteristics and/or behaviors. Agents can receive information and/or learn and therefore have adaptive capabilities. The strength of ABMs is the ability to model complex systems from the bottom up with agents that have believable and realistic behaviors (33, 34). In situations characterized by risk as in the onset of a disease outbreak, the heterogeneity of human responses can lead to complex and dynamic outcomes challenging to foresee. Therefore, modeling agents with human-like characteristics including the ability to appraise and respond to events also with non-rational behaviors, is essential for social-ecological studies (18, 35). An example of the potential of ABMs for epidemiological applications came from the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Studies (MIDAS2). In this collaborative effort, a set of ABMs was developed to investigate avian flu transmission incorporating epidemiological, environmental and social aspects and has been used to analyze outbreaks, model outcomes of interventions involving human behaviors and shape policies to help reduce the impact of avian influenza (34). Because ABMs allow explicit modeling of decision-making processes, interactions and networks, they represent an effective approach for simulating the system structure of the swine industry, specifically by incorporating both disease dynamics emerging from virus transmission with animal and feed movement, and human decision processes influencing biosecurity and movement interactions.",

The modeled hog supply chain includes both single- and multi-site production with networks of pig movement and feed deliveries. The other two main ABM components are the epidemiological and human decision-making components. The epidemiological component contains the mechanisms of PEDv transmission (direct and indirect), while the human behavioral component accounts for risk attitude and decision-making that influence biosecurity in the system. The elements of human decision-making and behavior were selected to reflect patterns observed by industry professionals to have major effects on farm biosecurity: (1) psychological distancing (36) that leads to a relaxation of compliance with biosecurity protocols as time passes without experiencing disease; (2) responsiveness to disease presence and; (3) the willingness of farm managers/owners to invest in biosecurity. The explicit inclusion of human behavior into the ABM provides a dimension for accounting for both the willingness to implement preventive biosecurity measures and to comply with them. Thus, with agent-based modeling we can represent the influence of responsiveness, heterogeneity, information exchange, psychological distancing, and interactions of humans and the environment.",

The hog production chain simulated for this study is a system mirroring the density, operation types and sizes of production units found in North Carolina with data provided by the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS) tool which draws from the USDA Census of Agriculture and aerial images (39). Feed mills and slaughter plants were initialized at random locations with numbers obtained from public data and expert advising. Hog production in the U.S. is increasing, which has resulted in increased vertical integration. Multiple sites are used in the production flow with specialized sites for sows, weanlings, growers and finishing pigs, or any combination of these growth stages. The ABM production agents are therefore also characterized by one of six holding types (farrow-to-wean, wean-to-feeder, feeder-to-finish, farrow-to-finish, wean-to-finish, and feeder-to-finish), size (total number of animals), and number of pig batches (groups of pigs of the same age). Other structural parameters include the basic functions of the hog production system such as the process of birth and growth. Birth, growth and movements of pigs are modeled at the group level using batches of pigs of the same age. The production system of the hog industry requires transfer of hogs from one holding type to the next and in the end to the slaughter plant. For instance, in a three-site production system a pig batch moves from farrow-to-wean to wean-to-feeder to feeder-to-finish sites before finally being sent to the slaughter plant. Pig batch movement as well as feed deliveries generate heterogeneous interactions among agents and are included in the ABM using networks of transportation (Supplementary Figure 1). These networks are modeled with agents having set trading and service areas according to their industry role and characterized by neighborhood structures.",

It is coupled with a stochastic state transition model including Susceptible (S) and Infectious (I) states. Probability functions regulate the transmission of disease in single agent interactions while the network structure of animal and feed movement determine the ultimate pattern of disease spread. Each simulated agent (hog producers, slaughter plants, and feed mills) may become infected (state I) during an interaction with another agent with a probability that depends on the type of interaction, the agent's biosecurity and a seasonality factor. Specifically, each type of movement interaction is associated with an independent probability of infection calculated using a logistic function. The logistic functions describe the infection probability's dependence on the agent's biosecurity with coefficients derived from the estimates provided using expert opinion. The seasonal variability in PEDv infectivity is modeled as a sinusoidal adjustment on the logistic probability function that varies with time and ultimately generates higher infection probabilities in winter and lower in summer.

Within the network, the veterinarian tracks the number of hog producers affected by disease and reports it back weekly.

In particular, the agents' risk-attitude is directly linked to their response to disease by determining the threshold number of neighboring infected production premises necessary for an agent to react and increase its biosecurity with a probability >0.9. We associate risk aversion with higher propensity to adopt biosecurity. For example, risk averse agents almost always increase biosecurity as soon as there are three production premises infected in their veterinarian network. On the opposite side of the risk spectrum, risk tolerant agents increase their biosecurity quasi certainly only when they know that there are nine or more infected production premises in their veterinarian network. In summary, the ABM agent behavior originates from a risk attitude distribution with four categories (risk averse, risk opportunists, risk neutral, and risk tolerant); four forms of disease response, one for each risk attitude category are used to simulate biosecurity response-to-disease strategies; and a utility function for psychological distancing, which simulates the waning of biosecurity compliance since an infection event.

To this end, we ran a scenario analysis where we shifted fractions of the producer population between risk tolerant and risk averse categories and then evaluated the resulting PEDv incidence. Six model scenarios were compared to a reference baseline scenario (Table 1), assigned to the case where the producer population is evenly distributed across all risk attitude categories upon model initialization. The populations of feed mill and slaughter plant agents were kept at even percentages of agents across the four risk attitude groups in all seven scenarios. The baseline scenario in particular was the reference for being the model that we calibrated against observed data. The ABM calibration was performed using AnyLogic software with the built-in genetic algorithm by matching the observed (Figure 1) and the simulated PEDv incidence. More information about the calibration methods and results can be found in the Supplementary Material, section Calibration of ABM's human behavioral component. For the six alternative scenarios (Table 1), all the model parameters were kept fixed at the calibrated values (Supplementary Table 1), while the initial proportion of population in the risk attitude groups were varied. For this analysis, the ABM was run over the time period spanning from 12/27/2009 to 02/25/2018. The first part of this period until 05/31/2014 was used to stabilize to model. The period 06/01/2014 to 02/25/2018 overlapping the observations' time series (Figure 1) produced the data for the analysis.

For example, a shift of risk averse agents from 25% (baseline) to 37.5% (more risk averse population) results in a steeper median trend (20% more negative), in other words, disease spread decreases faster. When we look at intercepts, an initial producer population with 37.5% risk averse agents created a situation where the PEDv virus had less infectivity since the simulation start with a median intercept of disease incidence 22% smaller than the intercept of the baseline scenario. We could not claim statistical support for a difference in the distribution of intercepts and slopes between the baseline scenario and the close scenarios (17.5, 22.5, 27.5, and 32.5% averse) except for the case of the intercept distribution for the 17.5% averse scenario (same compact letters in Figure 4).",

Fewer runs (<25%) in each scenario showed instead a positive trend indicating some model realizations in which the PEDv outbreak led to a growing incidence through time. These positive-trend cases emerge in the stochastic approach of Monte Carlo experiments where, by the law of large numbers (of simulations) more rare outcomes may also be realized.

The graphs in Figure 6 display the time series of PEDv incidence for the observation data and for the scenario averages, calculated across the 800 Monte Carlo runs, along with their trends. Our outputs demonstrate that the mechanisms and parameterization of the ABM are capable of reproducing decreasing PEDv incidence through time thanks to the dynamics of human behavior where agents could respond to PEDv presence by increasing biosecurity. In other words, the human behavioral assumptions built into our ABM influencing biosecurity and disease transmission probabilities, allowed the realizations of negative incidence trends. Furthermore, the higher propensity to increase biosecurity assigned to risk averse agents did result in lower incidence when there was a sufficient number of risk averse agents in the population. Despite the fact that most of the simulations missed the observed initial high peak of incidence, the shaded areas displaying the averaged Monte Carlo outputs plus and minus one standard deviation demonstrate that the ABM did realize disease outbreaks with high peaks of incidence.",

Because the characteristic pathways of infection of the virus have not changed over time, we deduced that something has been changing in the hog production system that has improved the control of the virus. Both the literature and collaborating stakeholders refer to human behaviors with respect to both in compliance with and investment in biosecurity as critical for disease-protection management. This implies a key role of humans in the processes of controlling virus transmission. To better understand how changes in behavioral patterns could reflect changes in PEDv incidence, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) able to examine the role of human risk attitude to PEDv incidence within a simulated production system. Our model outputs reproduced a significant decrease in PEDv incidence through time. An important finding from our scenario analysis was that the average decreasing trend is significantly affected by the model's initial state, defining the proportion of the producer agents assigned to two risk categories, risk averse and risk tolerant. An increase as small as 10% more risk averse producer agents resulted in a 19% decrease in the median total PEDv incidence, which is equivalent to 36 fewer PEDv cases over the course of the analysis period (~4 years). To observe a significantly steeper decrease in incidence requires that more than 37.5% of the population be in the risk averse category. The implication is that biosecurity adoption and influencing factors of adoption (for example risk attitude) are a critical consideration when creating strategic plans or policies for disease control. Our modeling analysis reinforces the message found not only in field-specific papers but also in general papers such as in (42) who calls for developing more effective approaches for integrating social dynamics of epidemics to build more realistic models.",

An interesting finding is that a producer-agent population with only 12.5% agents in the risk averse category resulted in statistical indicators where the median is closer to the observed value.

Our ABM uses a sinusoidal function calibrated to peak in January and therefore produces incidence oscillations that are more regular with time. A variety of reasons can be postulated to explain the complex variability in the observations including weather variability, changes in production components and/or routes and stochastic factors affecting disease spread. Our model simulates a closed production system where all the hog and feed movements are bounded within the region. Even if designed around the North Carolina configuration of production premises, the model does not include the complex network system that extends beyond the state boundary into other U.S. states.

Our ABM was equipped with two behavioral processes that act in opposition: (1) responsiveness to regional disease incidence with consequent increase in biosecurity and (2) psychological distancing with consequent decrease in biosecurity as time increases since an infection. Model calibration provided the appropriate tension between the two processes to match the observed decreasing trend in PEDv incidence. With these two behavioral processes we were able to capture important features of the PEDv dynamics as shown in our results.

Issued on June 5, 2014, a Federal Order required the reporting of swine enteric coronavirus diseases including PEDv (https://www.aasv.org/aasv%20website/Resources/Diseases/PorcineEpidemicDiarrhea.php). On March 6, 2018, USDA rescinded the Federal Order (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/news/sa_by_date/sa-2018/secd-reporting). The dark green line traces the decreasing trend in incidence in NC with a slope m = \u22120.02. This is equivalent to an average decrease from about 20 new cases in the month June, 2014 down to eight new cases in the same month in 2017.",

It highlights the ABM's main components and processes of how the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) can spread through the network structure of the swine industry and is influenced by human behavior. The ABM structural component mimics the swine industry with three types of agents: P, producer; FM, feed mill; and SP, slaughter plant. Agents interact via networks of hog and feed movement. The ABM epidemiological component simulates the risk of PEDv transmission associated with movement through these network connections disease spreads. Human decisions on biosecurity also influence infection risk. Disease spread depends on the probability of disease transmission on the networks and influences the biosecurity level on farms.",

Each scenario represents a different distribution of risk attitudes within the population of producer agents in our ABM. The baseline-scenario population has equal proportions of producer agents in the all four groups (risk averse, risk opportunistic, risk neutral, risk tolerant). Three scenarios (12.5, 17.5, and 22.5% averse) tested the effect of reducing the number of risk averse producers by shifting a fraction (10, 30, or 50%) of producer agents from the risk averse to the risk tolerant category and are color coded with red shades. The other three scenarios (27.5, 32.5, and 37.5% averse) tested the effect of increasing the number of risk averse producers by shifting a fraction (10, 30, or 50%) of producer agents from the risk tolerant to the risk averse category and are color coded with blue shades. Each scenario distribution is drawn from a Monte Carlo experiment with 800 replicates. The compact letter display indicates significance from pairwise comparison. For the scenarios sharing a letter there is no evidence of a difference for that pair of distributions at adjusted \u03b1* = 0.002 level (Bonferroni adjustment for 21 comparisons).
