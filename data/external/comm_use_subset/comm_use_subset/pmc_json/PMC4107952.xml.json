Most such infections are due to viruses\n[2], which can provoke epidemics and, in some cases, pandemics. For example, in November 2002 a novel coronavirus emerged in southern China, then spread rapidly throughout world in 2003, affecting 25 countries across the five continents. This coronavirus, SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), affected 8000 people, of whom almost 800 died\n[3]. Likewise, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A (H5N1) spread extensively in migratory birds and poultry across 64 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa\n[4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 630 confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection, with a case fatality rate of approximately 60% and significant economic losses\n[4-6]. The pH1N1 pandemic that started in 2009 lasted 14 months, from June 2009 to August 2010, and was responsible for thousands of cases and deaths\n[7]. In August 2010, 214 countries and territories throughout the world reported 18 449 deaths from A(H1N1)pdm09 infection\n[8].",

In 2008, an estimated 28 000 to 111 500 deaths among children aged less than 5 years were attributed to influenza-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI), 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries\n[9]. A meta-analysis included 51 studies of children hospitalized between 0 and 4 years of age with severe ALRI from 1995 to 2011 on the American continent (Canada, USA, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, Argentina), Europe (Spain, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece), Africa (South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya), Asia (Israel, Jordan, India, China, South Korea, Japan, Burma, Malaysia) and Oceania (Indonesia, Australia). The main viral etiologies were adenovirus (8.8%), influenza virus (7%), and PIV (5.8%)\n[10]. In the Western Pacific region, the proportions of cases of ILI attributed to influenza virus between 2006 and 2010 were 57% in China, 19% in Japan, 7% in the Republic of Korea, 4% in the Philippines and Singapore, and 3% in Australia\n[11]. ILI and influenza virus infections usually peak during the winter months in temperate countries. In tropical countries, the most common viral etiologies of ILI reported in children under five years old are RSV, PIV-3, adenovirus and influenza virus, as in temperate regions\n[12]. Influenza virus accounts for 5% to 30% of cases of ILI worldwide\n[13-18].",

In this large nationwide study of ILI in Gabon, central Africa, we found that 61.4% of nasal swabs contained at least one virus. Most previous studies have shown a viral prevalence below 50%\n[13,37-39], although figures up to 75% have been reported\n[14,16,17]. Children less than 5 years old accounted for most cases of ILI in our study (77.8%), and 68.1% of them had a documented viral infection (Tables \n1 and\n2). According to a WHO communication in 2012, 1.2 million children under five years old die each year from pneumonia\n[40]. It should be noted that Gabonese adults rarely consult for ILI, possibly explaining why they only represented 11.5% of our study population. All these reasons led us to focus on children under five years old.",

The predominant viruses in our study are broadly the same as those diagnosed in neighboring countries, especially among young children. Indeed, in Cameroon, 28.2% of specimens was influenza virus, however, the most common viruses found in children under 5 years of age were RSV (83.9% of specimens) PIV (76.9%) and HRV (64.6%). In the Central African Republic, respiratory viruses were detected in 14.9% of children aged 0\u201315 years with ILI or acute respiratory illness, including influenza virus in 8.8%, PIV1/3 in 3.3% and RSV 2.7%\n[44]. Influenza virus was found in 15% of ILI patients in DRC from 2009 to 2011\n[45]. Despite the prevalence sometimes different depending on the viruses diagnosed in central Africa countries, the main viruses responsible for ILI were the same. An exception is made for Adv which are predominant in our study. In other tropical country as Brazil, ILI sentinel surveillance from 2000 to 2010 showed that the viral etiology of ILI was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 31% of cases, influenza A in 26%, adenovirus (AdV) in 12%, parainfluenza 2 (PIV-2) in 9%, parainfluenza 3 (PIV-3) in 9%, and influenza B in 9%\n[9]. In others countries African countries as Kenya, Ghana, in India, or Europe, the prevalence of RSV in children under 5 years of age with ILI ranges between 12% and 60%\n[13,42,46-48], while that of PIV and adenovirus ranges between 3-22% and 5-25% respectively\n[13,15,42,46-50].

A similar prevalence of AdV was observed in a Kenyan study in which the median age (1 year) was similar to that of our population (2 years)\n[13]. In young children, asymptomatic porting has been shown for some respiratory viruses such as adenovirus or rhinovirus\n[53]. More specifically, asymptomatic adenovirus infections are common in young children\n[53,54]. In our study, adenoviruses have a predominant prevalence. They are also common in co-infection. Asymptomatic carriage of the virus among young people and their high prevalence in co-infection suggested that they might not be the cause of the disease. RSV, the main etiologic agent of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children, has a reported prevalence of 14% to 34% in children with respiratory tract infection, and is particularly frequent in infants less than one year old\n[42,52,55]. The prevalence of RSV was lower in our study than in many previous reports, in which it reached 50% among children aged between 0 and 4 years\n[10,56]. However, the children in these latter studies were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infections, whereas the children in our study did not always require hospitalization. RSV was none the less one of the five main viruses detected in our study (13.5%). All PIV types were detected in our study, with a predominance of PIV3 as in several previous studies\n[57-59]. The prevalence of influenza virus (11.9%) was similar to that observed in other countries (10% to 13%) after the pH1N1 pandemic\n[17]. Among the influenza viruses, A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B represented 57.3% and 42.7% of cases, respectively. These results could be explained by the fact that our study took place after the global emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09: pandemic influenza and influenza B was more frequent than non A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza A. From November 2010 to February 2011, the subtypes of influenza virus which were mostly prevalent in North Africa, the Near East, Europe and Asia, were the subtype B and the A(H1N1)pdm09\n[60]. Our results match those described in the world for this time of year and show that these two types of influenza are predominant.",

In Gabon, we found that, among children less than five years old, the number of cases of ILI and the virus detection rate were highest during the rainy seasons from March to May and October to December. The prevalence of PIV infection was highest in April 2010, during the rainy season (Figure \n2). Influenza virus and RSV detection increased from November 2010 to December 2010 and then declined in January and February during the short dry season. Our results are compatible with those of a Malaysian study showing seasonal increases in RSV (September to December), PIV1 and PIV3 (March to May), and influenza B (November). Moreover, this latter study showed a correlation between the prevalence of RSV and the number of rainy days\n[41]. RSV infection has been found to peak in the rainy season in tropical countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Gambia and Colombia\n[12,42]. Influenza viruses are most prevalent during cold winter months in the temperate northern hemisphere, and during the rainy season in tropical countries such as Senegal, India and Brazil\n[11,12,20]. EV was detected throughout the year in our study but peaked in May 2010 and March 2011 (rainy seasons). EV seasonality was observed in a study of Caribbean asthmatic children, in which the prevalence increased during the rainy season\n[64]. In France, EV respiratory infections peaked in children in June-July over several years\n[65]. In our study, HRV was detected throughout most of the year, as in Madagascar and the West Indies, but peaked from February to April 2011, revealing a seasonal pattern\n[16,64]. Another study showed that HRV infection in South African young children peaked from February to April, corresponding to autumn months\n[66]. We detected the highest prevalence of HCoVs (50%) during April 2010 (rainy season). HCoV-OC43 co-circulated with HCoV-NL63 during the long rainy season in 2010, with HCoV-229E during the short rainy season in 2010, and with HCoV-HKU1 during the long rainy season in 2011. A seasonal pattern of HCoVs was also observed in Hong Kong, where HCoV-NL63 infection peaked in September-October, while HCoV-OC43 peaked in December-January\n[67].",
