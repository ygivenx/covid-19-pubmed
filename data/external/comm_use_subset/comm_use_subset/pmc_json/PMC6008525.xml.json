Through its volunteer members, it houses scientific sections that promote areas of specific interest. The Union's ZTB sub-section is a global network of physicians, veterinarians, researchers, economists and social anthropologists that works to understand the dynamics of ZTB, create global awareness, and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration to address the challenges posed by it. Efforts conducted by the ZTB sub-section has led to a continuous and stable increase in the number of activities, attention, and attendees to ZTB-related activities at the annual Union World Conference on Lung Health. For example, at the 2010 conference in Berlin, Germany, there was only one ZTB session (symposium) attended by less than 10 people. Over the last seven years, the ZTB activities at the annual conference have increased to two scientific symposia, one poster session, one meet the expert session, press releases, and a keynote talk on ZTB at the plenary session in South Africa during the 2015 conference. During the last conference in Guadalajara, Mexico in October 2017, an audience of approximately 75 professionals from different disciplines attended each of the two ZTB scientific symposia.",

The combined involvement and commitment of these three institutions has been crucial to successfully develop a ZTB roadmap since these institutions jointly: (1) provide global leadership for TB prevention, care and control (WHO); (2) is responsible for improving animal health and welfare (OIE); and (3) work toward improving food security, nutrition and agricultural productivity and reduce rural poverty (FAO).",

The strategy aims to end, rather than merely control, the global TB epidemic, with targets to reduce TB deaths by 95% and to reduce new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035, and to ensure that no family is burdened with catastrophic expenses due to TB. It set interim milestones for 2020, 2025, and 2030 (16). Thus, finding and treating every case of TB, whether caused by M. tb or M. bovis, will count toward the achievement of this ambitious goal. For this reason, as countries move toward detecting the 3 million TB cases estimated to be missed annually, and in light of the endorsed WHO \u201cEND TB\u201d strategy, the Tripartite, The Union and the key organizations concerned with human and animal health, agriculture and TB joined forces to develop a Zoonotic TB Road Map outlining medium- and long-term milestones to globally address the prevention, surveillance, diagnostic, and treatment challenges faced by persons with ZTB.",

Table 1 is an excerpt from the ZTB Roadmap in which the short (year 2020) and medium term (year 2025) milestones to be accomplished are outlined under the three core themes of the roadmap. One of the key elements toward accomplishing these goals is that the unique cultural and socioeconomic factors that shape the relationship between people, livestock, and wildlife species in different ecosystems must be taken into account, while including the at- risk communities in future efforts to reduce the risk of zoonotic transmission of M. bovis across species. These efforts not only need to focus on preventing transmission from livestock (mostly cattle) to humans, but also, and in parallel, to reduce the prevalence of the disease in both domestic and wildlife species. The availability of improved diagnostic tools for ZTB in different species, as well as the implementation of disease monitoring, surveillance, and prevention strategies in livestock and wildlife species will be a crucial and much needed component to be able to implement comprehensive programs that will account for the complexities ZTB poses due to its zoonotic nature. Finally, including vaccination of wildlife (where feasible), not only has the potential for reducing the burden of disease, but also could play an important role in conservation efforts, especially among endangered and protected species.",
