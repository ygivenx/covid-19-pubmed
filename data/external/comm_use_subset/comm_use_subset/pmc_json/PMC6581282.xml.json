            "text": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic emerging virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. The virus was first detected in 1998 when it caused an outbreak of severe, rapidly progressing encephalitis in pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore, with a case-fatality rate of 38% [1]. Pigs were most likely infected after eating fruit contaminated by infected fruit bats of the genus Pteropus, the animal reservoir of NiV [2]. This was then followed by pig-to-human infection, but only very limited human-to-human transmission was reported [3]. Since then, NiV has caused near annual outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. Reported outbreaks in these countries involve fewer patients, with a higher case-fatality rate (average 75%) [4] and, in contrast to the Malaysia outbreak, there are well-documented cases of human-to-human transmission [5]. It has been hypothesized that the source for NiV infection in index cases in India and Bangladesh is palm sap contaminated with bat urine [6\u20139]. The most recent outbreak of NiV occurred in the Indian state Kerala in May 2018 where 19 patients were infected resulting in 17 fatalities. Although this state had not seen NiV infections before 2018, bats of the genus Pteropus are prevalent in this area. Sequence analyses have demonstrated that isolates originating from Malaysia and Bangladesh represent two different genetic lineages [10\u201312].",

The current lack of licensed vaccines or treatments has prompted the WHO to identify NiV as a pathogen requiring urgent investment into development of countermeasures [16]. Given the sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks, the aim is to develop a vaccine that demonstrates protective efficacy in animal models and acceptable safety and immunogenicity profiles in phase I and II clinical trials. Vaccines which meet these criteria will be stockpiled and may then be used in the event of an outbreak, following clinical trial protocols for use prepared in advance.",

A common feature of these vaccines is their low reactogenicity, strong immunogenicity, and the absence of vector replication after immunization, an important safety feature. In pre-clinical studies a single dose of ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines has been shown to be protective against infection with Rift Valley Fever Virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Zika virus [18\u201321]. Large scale manufacturing has been performed for replication-deficient adenoviral vectored vaccines for Ebola, with one vaccine now licensed and another in advanced clinical development [22, 23]. Further, a simple thermostabilization process allows for vaccine storage at ambient temperatures [24], removing the need for a cold chain for storage and shipping. We now report on pre-clinical immunogenicity and efficacy testing of ChAdOx1 NiVB.",

For the homologous challenge vaccine experiment, animals were vaccinated at D-70 and/or D-42. For the heterologous challenge experiment, animals were vaccinated at D-28. Three days prior to vaccination and virus challenge animals were bled via orbital sinus puncture.

We chose the I.P. route as a uniformly lethal challenge route and to be able to compare with previously conducted vaccine experiments [27]. For each study group, 10 hamsters were utilized. Of these, four animals were euthanized 4 (HeV) or 5 (NiV) days post inoculation and the remaining six animals were followed for 28 days post challenge.

Animals were challenged with a lethal dose of NiV Bangladesh (1000 LD50) one day post passive transfer (Fig 5A). We were unable to detect neutralizing antibodies in serum obtained at D5 from four hamsters from each group. However, serum from animals treated with NiV antibodies was positive by ELISA against NiV G protein, albeit with a lower reciprocal titer than antibodies in serum obtained from single-dose vaccinated animals (Fig 5B). One out of six animals treated with NiV antibodies succumbed to disease on D11. No weight loss was observed, however the animal showed severe neurological signs. None of the other NiV antibody-treated animals experienced weight loss or signs of disease. Four out of six animals treated with GFP antibodies succumbed to disease between D6 and D8. These animals showed weight loss and respiratory or neurological signs. The two surviving animals did not show any signs of disease throughout the experiment. One of these animals did not seroconvert as measured by ELISA against NiV F and G protein, and it was suspected this animal was not infected. Therefore, this animal was excluded from the survival curve.

Having one vaccine that protects against both lineages of NiV virus would be the easiest and cheapest countermeasure. A single-dose vaccination with ChAdOx1 NiVB, which is based on NiV Bangladesh, fully protected Syrian hamsters against lethal disease caused by NiV Malaysia. The G proteins of the NiV strains used in this study are 95.5% pairwise identical on the amino acid level, with 27 amino acid differences scattered throughout the protein. Although we did not see sterile protection against NiV Malaysia, none of the vaccinated animals showed signs of disease and all were protected against lethal disease.

ChAdOx1 NiVB only protected partially against HeV challenge; four out of six animals did not survive challenge. We observed a non-significant decrease in infectious HeV titer in lung and brain tissue of vaccinated animals compared to control animals.

Furthermore, the total number of human cases that contracted HeV is relatively low at 7 [13]. Thus, the requirement of a human vaccine for HeV is therefore less urgent than that of a NiV vaccine.",

Likewise, administration of a human neutralizing monoclonal antibody (m102.4) provided full protection against both HeV and NiV in multiple animal models [51, 52]. Administration of purified IgG obtained from ChAdOx1 NiVB vaccinated hamsters provided partial protection against NiV challenge. Furthermore, infectious virus could only be detected in the lungs of control animals and not in the lungs of vaccinated animals, and thus as in previous studies, ChAdOx1 NiVB-elicited antibodies are able to provide protection against a lethal challenge with NiV. Although we were able to detect NiV G protein-specific antibodies in serum obtained from NiV antibody-treated animals, the reciprocal titer was much lower than that detected in serum from Syrian hamsters after a single dose of ChAdOx1 NiVB. It is possible that administering a higher dose of IgG would have led to uniform protection.",
