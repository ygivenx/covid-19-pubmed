Most of the early studies addressed the effects of relative higher doses that are not relevant to most populations. Despite intensive recent studies with regard to the immune system as a target of heavy metals, some inconsistencies have been evolved especially regarding the effects of low-dose exposure. The reported impairments ranged from minor insidious or transitional changes up to occasional death of the exposed subjects [1-8]. This variation in susceptibility has been attributed to genetic variability, variety of methodological regimes such as the metal form, duration of exposure, the dosage applied as well as the activity of the cells [9]. The biological indicator or the read-out system used to evaluate the changes elicited can not be ruled out.",

            "text": "Cytokines are very important agents to detect modulations of the immune system. Due to their sensitivity, they can be modulated at lower doses than other arms of the immune system [10]. Measuring cytokines and other soluble mediators involved in immune regulation has been the focus of researchers for over three decades. Several reports on the quantification of ever-growing number of analytes in a single reaction vessel have been emerged using fluorescent-labeled microspheres, the protein bead array (PBA)-based assays [11-17]. The importance of assessing cytokines is evidenced by the fact that they form the basis of a sophisticated cellular communication network for normal as well as modulated immune responses. Experiments using isolated human cells or cytokine gene knock-out mice have been proven to be useful for evaluating the regulation of immunocompetent cells in response to infection or following exposure to heavy metals. Central to these regulatory agents are CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, that are known to differentiate into at least two subsets, Th1 and Th2, both in mice [18] and in humans [19]. These cells secrete different but overlapping sets of cytokines: the common precursor Th0 secrete cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b3; Th1 cells produce IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b2, and low levels of IL-10 (only in human); and Th2 cells IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13 [20-22] and IL-6 [23]. Differentiation of Th0 is believed to be a consequence of several cellular influences, such as the cytokine milieu. While differentiation into Th1 cells requires the presence of IL-12, Th2 cells response warrants the presence of IL-4 [24]. Moreover, both types cross-regulate each other in a variety of ways [20,24,25]. The dominance of one of these subsets results in either a predominantly cellular (Th1-mediated) or an antibody (Th2-mediated) response [9]. Therefore, the inclination of the Th1/Th2 balance indicated by cytokine profiles changes and/or cytokine-dependent regulatory pathways have been often considered to evaluate heavy metal-mediated immunomodulation and in risk assessment studies [26].",

Treg cells includes, among others, constitutive CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ Treg cells, Type 1 T regulatory cells (Tr1) and Th3 cells, characterized by production of high levels of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 [28]. Most recently, studies of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and adjuvant-induced arthritis have pointed to the importance of IL-17-producing (Th17) cells, [27]. The optimal recipe to differentiate into Th17 remains so far unclear; yet, together with TGF-\u03b2 [29-31], a group of cytokines produced by LPS-activated DC, namely IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 favor Th17 differentiation [32]. Other cytokines seem to share inducing or maintaining different Th cell subsets, e.g. IL-23, due to its p40 unit, just like IL-12, in addition to induction of Th1, is known to be important for the survival of Th17 cells [33].",

            "text": "Interleukin-12 is a 70-kDa heterodimeric (composed of covalently linked p35/p40) pro-inflammatory cytokine produced mostly by phagocytic cells and to some degree by B cells. It is considered to date the most critical factor for skewing the immune response towards a Th1 type, and thereby exerts a substantial stimulatory influence on host responses to intracellular pathogens [34-36]. However, there are clues that IL-12, in synergy with IL-4, supports the long-term proliferation and maturation of resting neonatal CD4+ T cells into IFN-\u03b3 \u2013 or IL-4-producing cells, and transiently increases the production of both cytokines by human Th2-like cell clones [37]. The present study was conducted to examine the relationship between heavy metal-induced IL-12 profile modifications and the accompanying Th1/Th2-polarized responses of cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). To this end, two pathways of cell activation were adopted, either through monoclonal antibodies (mAb: anti-CD3/-CD28/-CD40) or heat-killed Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (hkSE). Furthermore, the association of IL-12 with a skewed in vivo immune response was also investigated in BALB/c mice exposed to heavy metals in a pathogen-free environment. In order to test the metal effects at the protein as well as mRNA levels and to evaluate the relevance of various traditionally-used methods, cytokines were assessed by ELISA, cytometric bead-based array (CBA) and RT-PCR.",

Previous reports on this issue indicated that Cd- or Hg-induced immunomodulation was dependent on cell stimulation pathways [26,42]. Moreover, in vivo data using BALB/c mice revealed a distinct Th1/Th2 pattern following exposure to sub-lethal doses of Cd acetate or Hg chloride for different periods [43]. These effects were evident even at low concentrations of both metals, at which only insignificant changes in cell vitality were detected, indicating that \"cytokines\", may serve as more sensitive indicators for heavy metal-induced immune modulation than other parameters such as vitality response. The current data indicates the synergism between IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 and reveals distinct patterns of response to heavy metals depending on the metal ion itself as well as duration of exposure.",

In accordance with previous reports [14,26,40], the three methods revealed comparable results indicating their relevance to evaluate the immune response. Comparing the serum cytokine profiles of heavy metal-exposed mice with mRNA expression ratios revealed an overall concordance between them (spearman's r value in all cases \u2265 0.81, p < 0.01). This infers that these metals exert a modulatory effect at the pre-transcriptional stages of cytokine production and indicates the relevance of CBA and RT-PCR to evaluate such modulation. However, evaluating cytokines by the PBA-based assays offers definitive advantages including being quantitative. RT-PCR is quantitative as well [41], but only using other reference house-keeping gene for calibration, which can be even affected by the treatment. Another advantage of the PBA over enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) or ELISA and RT-PCR is that it is performed with a smaller sample volume to measure multiple analytes simultaneously in a single sample [12,14-16,40]. This factor reduces execution time and costs, even adds more precision to the assay and is an advantage when the sample volume is limited as in pediatrics, disease surveillance or in experiments using animal models [12,16,40]. Therefore, and because of the longer processing time and the elaborate sample preparation as well as the costs of RT-PCR techniques, quantifying cytokines using the PBA offers a great ease of performance. In comparison with ELISA, the wide calibration range of the PBA offers a great flexibility [40]. Moreover, analyzing the performance of an established HIV-1 PBA for detection of plasma Abs revealed its advantage in the resolution of weakly reactive samples comparable to two EIAs and Western blot technique [16], the former being able to offer the high throughput of EIA combined with the individual protein testing capacity of the Western blotting.",

One of the most consistent observations is that, although it is more flexible, user friendly and cost-effective than ELISA, both still detect non-overlapping parameter populations. Another limitation may be the interference with some serum proteins as some samples revealed different results when measured with different titrations. Replacing such low-sensitive parameters with more reliable agents and applying sample dilutions may relieve such problems. Here, the use of 20 \u03bcL of 1:2 diluted serum samples allowed quantification of cytokines adequately. Taken together, the PBA may be ranked as the most relevant to quantify cytokines in animal experiments and for immune surveillance in heavy metal-exposed subjects. Optimizing the assay may include acquiring a large number of individual bead measurements at low ligand concentrations [13]. This will improve cost benefits and raise the reproducibility of PBA. A recently established analytical workflow [17] may offer the possibility for a subsequent population-level analysis to test hypotheses generated by donor-profile analysis and thereby adding scientific insights to allow the practical distinguishing between different cohorts of the same population using such a promising tool of immune detection.",

            "text": "The results described here are consistent with previous reports and support the reciprocal interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune responses. The early preference of the Th differentiation was believed to depend on the balance between IL-12 (Th1 responses) and IL-4 (Th2 responses) profiles [44]. Infection models of Listeria, Leishmania, Schistosoma and Toxoplasma inferred that IL-12 induced Th1 immune responses and inhibited Th2 cells differentiation [45,46]. Similarly, in peripheral type 1 response, IL-12 induced the synthesis of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF-\u03b1 [47]; TNF-\u03b1 implicated in mediating the effects of IL-12 on NK cells. Furthermore, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 were found to activate IFN-\u03b3-producing NK and T cells [34,48]. Therefore, administration of IL-12 reversed the Th2-dominant heavy metal-induced inhibition of host defense and boosted the resistance of untreated mice marked by elevation of IFN-\u03b3 profiles [35]. Similar effects were elucidated in wild-type as well as in IL-12 KO and IL-4 KO BALB/c mice [49,50], where IL-12 was indispensable for the induction of a protective Th1 response against Salmonella infection. The possible promotion of IL-12 in Th1 effector function was confirmed by the observation that fully differentiated Th1 cells continue to express functional IL-12 receptor [51]. The loss of the transcription factor GATA-3 expression by developing Th1 cells [52], an augmenting Th2-cell-specific factor [53], constitute an additional evidence for the requirement of a continued IL-12 signaling in the maintenance of a Th1 response.",

            "text": "However, there is evidence that diminishes the role of IL-12 in favoring a Th1-type immune response and indicates that the differentiation into either Th1 or Th2 phenotype does not constitute a simple dichotomy. For example, although Leishmania major evokes an IL-4 response in IL-12p40 KO mice [54], the diminished Th1 response observed in STAT4-deficient mice following infection with L. major or Toxoplasma gondii was not accompanied by a compensatory Th2 response [55]. Furthermore, neither the depletion of IFN-\u03b3 in IL-12 KO mice nor the neutralization of IL-12 in IFN-\u03b3 R KO mice affected the corona virus-elicited type 1 cytokine pattern [56], and hence IL-12 was proposed not to be essential for the generation of a Th1-polarized response and that viruses may selectively induce IFN-\u03b3 production even in the absence of IL-12. Other cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1 [57] or other host factors or signaling elements, e.g. MyD88 [58], may compensate for the lack of endogenous IL-12 or IFN-\u03b3 in determining Th cell differentiation in such viral infections. Recently, it has been found that bacterially-stimulated DC can not produce IL-12 unless the cultures also contain other cells or cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 [59]. Taken together, these data recall the importance of IL-12 for Th1 competence rather than cell priming per se [60], i.e. it is involved in the maintenance of an ongoing Th1 response rather than part of the initial immunological decision-making process. In the current study, the finding that production of IL-12 depends on cytokines from previously activated T cells may indicate a direct effect of heavy metals on Th1- or Th2-priming cytokine milieu (e.g. IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4). According to the current results inferring the close association between IL-12p70 and the induction of Th1 response, it seems that IL-12 may play a central role in attaining a polarized Th1/Th2 response in heavy metal-exposed individuals even in the absence of pathogenic antigens. This may raise the importance of IL-12 as a target for therapeutic approaches to re-stabilize the immune response in heavy metal-exposed individuals.",

Moreover, the association of modulating Th cell differentiation and IL-12 levels support the use of this cytokine as a target for therapeutic approaches to re-establish a normal balance that may modify Th1- or Th2-dependent diseases. Finally, measuring cytokines by CBA seems to be the most relevant and cost-effective methodology to evaluate immune modulation.",
