This peptide includes the charge distribution pattern with two essential positively charged amino acid residues (underlined) spaced apart by four amino acids that is similar to that of the TCR\u03b1 chain TMD either of human (VIGFRILLLKVAGFNLLMTL) or mouse (SVMGLRILLLKVAGFNLLMTL) origin. Based on the SCHOOL model, this sequence has been previously hypothesized to have a similar immunomodulatory activity as TCR CP (GLRILLLKV) or HIV gp41 FP29. A SARS CoV FP peptide mutant with two functionally important lysines replaced by glycines (MG11-2G) was used as a negative control peptide. We used the CIA mouse model, the most commonly studied autoimmune model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)30, since a vast majority of the studies of immunomodulatory activity of TCR CP and HIV gp41 FP has been done in animal models of autoimmune arthritis182022233132.",

On day 38, the mean \u00b1 SEM clinical arthritis score in MG11-treated mice with CIA was much lower than that in MG11-2G-treated mice (0.89 \u00b1 0.30 versus 3.16 \u00b1 0.47; P < 0.001).

To evaluate whether incorporation of MG11 into sHDL may have a similar effect, sHDL-bound MG11 was i.p. administered daily at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg MG11. Despite a 10-fold decrease in administration dose of MG11, the arthritis inhibitory effect observed for 2.5 mg/kg/day MG11-HDL was comparable to that observed for 25 mg/kg/day peptide in free form (Fig. 2a). Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are not completely understood and need to be further investigated, one can suggest that this results from the prolonged circulatory half-life of sHDL-bound MG11: while the in vivo peptide half-life is short, typically a few minutes35, sHDL are characterized by much longer half-lives up to 3\u20135 days36.",

The ankle joints had moderate inflammation and cartilage damage with minimal pannus and bone resorption, as well as mild periosteal bone formation (Fig. 4). Markedly thickened synovial membrane and capsule were observed as a result of pannus formation and inflammatory cell infiltration. As shown in Fig. 4, the chronic inflammation destroyed the joint lining, including the cartilage and other nearby supporting structures, such as bone. The formation of pannus is probably a result of overgrowth of the synoviocytes and the observed accumulation of inflammatory cells that led to deformed cartilage and bone. This agrees with the observed clinical scores. Similar histopathology of the joints was observed in the animals treated with MG11-2G at 25 mg/kg/day (not shown).",

            "text": "To successfully infect, replicate and persist in the host, viruses have evolved numerous strategies to take control of multiple cellular processes including those that target transmembrane signal transduction mediated by immune receptors including MIRRs (reviewed in424344). For T lymphotropic viruses, this approach allows the virus to inhibit TCR signaling to disarm the receptor and successfully enter the cell while for other viruses it allows for evasion from T cell response towards the infected cells424546. Recently reported TCR-targeted immunomodulatory activity mediated by HIV gp41 FP1718 suggests that fusion peptides function not only to fuse the virion with the host cell4748 but also to silence the TCR signaling pathway. Interestingly, the characteristic pattern of TCR-targeted inhibitory activity of HIV gp41 FP is strikingly similar to that of TCR CP: both peptides colocalize with TCR in the cell membrane, inhibit antigen- but not anti-CD3-stimulated T cell activation in vitro, and suppress autoimmune arthritis in vivo181920212325. Both peptides were suggested for the treatment of T cell-mediated pathologies including inflammatory skin diseases and RA18495051. In addition, TCR CP has been shown in human studies to be a proper treatment for human T cell-mediated dermatoses that can substitute for corticosteroids52. The molecular mechanisms of action for these clinically relevant peptides were first explained by the SCHOOL model13274353. Later, based on the SCHOOL model and primary sequence analysis of a variety of viral FPs including SARS-CoV FP, we hypothesized that similar to HIV gp41 FP, these FPs may not only have fusogenic but also TCR-targeted immunomodulatory activity and that the SCHOOL model, together with the lessons learned from viral pathogenesis, can be used practically for rational drug design and the development of new therapies for immune disorders29.",

In the present study, in order to provide compelling experimental in vivo evidence to support our hypothesis29, we used the SCHOOL model to design a 11-mer synthetic peptide MG11 (MYKTPTLKYFG) derived from the SARS-CoV FP sequence with the positioning of two essential positively charged lysine residues (underlined) spaced by four amino acids. The model suggests that this charge distribution pattern is functionally important to provide TCR-targeted inhibitory activity13294244. If our hypothesis is correct, the MG11 peptide should demonstrate the immunomodulatory activity in vivo similar to that demonstrated earlier for TCR CP and HIV gp41 FP in animal models of autoimmune arthritis18202123. The SARS CoV FP peptide mutant with lysines replaced by glycines (MG11-2G) was used as a negative control peptide. According to the SCHOOL model1329, this peptide cannot compete with the recognition TCR\u03b1 subunit for binding to \u03b6\u03b6 and CD3\u03b5\u03b4 signaling homo- and heterodimers (Fig. 1), and thus cannot inhibit TCR signaling. Because of discrepancies found in prior studies of the immunomodulatory activity of TCR inhibitory TM peptides between in vitro (no activity observed) and in vivo (anti-arthritic activity observed in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis, AIA) data23, in this study, we moved directly to in vivo studies and tested the MG11 and MG11-2G peptides in the CIA model of autoimmune arthritis.",

In order to prolong the half-life of MG11, we tested in the present study whether this peptide can be incorporated into sHDL nanoparticles that mimic human HDL, a group of native lipoproteins that transport cholesterol from the peripheral tissues to the liver and can be readily reconstituted in vitro from lipids and apolipoproteins (apos)54. Due to the half-life of native sHDL in normal subjects being 3\u20135 days36, these particles represent a promising and versatile delivery platform for peptide therapeutics. Synthetic (reconstituted) HDL have several competitive advantages as compared with other delivery platforms: 1) apo A-I, the major HDL protein, is an endogenous protein and does not trigger immunoreactions, 2) the small size (8\u201312 nm) allows HDL to enter and accumulate in tissue and organ areas of interest, and 3) a variety of drugs and imaging agents can be incorporated into this platform335556. With respect to therapeutics, human apo A-I is a large protein, which is purified from human plasma. Thus, in addition to the immense monetary cost in purification, further development of apo A-I-containing therapeutic agents would require a number of safety precautions followed by a complicated transition into clinical practice. Previously, we demonstrated that synthetic apo A-I peptides can functionally replace the native apo A-I protein in HDL. This encourages the further development of the HDL-based delivery platform. In the present study, synthetic sHDL that contain apo A-I peptides were successfully loaded with MG11 and subsequently purified and characterized using a variety of biophysical procedures.",

            "text": "This is the first study to test previously predicted immunomodulatory activity of SARS-CoV FP29. As expected from the anti-arthritic activities demonstrated in animal models of autoimmune arthritis for TCR CP202123 and HIV gp41 FP18, the SARS-CoV FP-derived peptide sequence MG11 significantly suppresses CIA in mice: the peptide at 25 mg/kg/day inhibits inflammation in CIA as assessed by clinical evaluation and scoring of the disease (Fig. 2). Histological analysis of the joints reveals that MG11 substantially reduces joint inflammation, protects against cartilage damage, abrogates bone erosion and reduces systemic bone loss (Figs 3 and 4) The effect is specific as the control MG11-2G peptide administered daily at the same dose of 25 mg/kg does not affect CIA. Incorporation of MG11 into sHDL reduces the effective dosage of the peptide: MG11 in free form at 25 mg/kg/day and sHDL-bound MG11 at 2.5 mg/kg/day show similar anti-arthritic effects in CIA both clinically and histologically. Interestingly, mice treated with free MG11 at a daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg did not exhibit any significant disease improvement as compared to vehicle-treated mice (not shown). At the molecular level, activated T cells mediate production of multiple cytokines and growth factors that are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of RA57. Many of these molecules serve as targets of cytokine-blocking therapies that are currently in development (e.g., IL-21, IL-23, and IL-33), at different phases of clinical trials (e.g., IL-7, IL-15, IL-17, and M-CSF) or approved (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1 blockers)57. In the present study, significantly reduced serum cytokine levels were observed in mice treated with MG11 as compared to vehicle-treated arthritic mice or mice treated with MG11-2G (Fig. 5). Colocalization of MG11 with TCR in the T cell membrane (Supplemental Fig. 1) further supports the suggested molecular mechanisms of the observed immunomodulatory activity of the peptide. These findings are consistent with those previously reported for TCR CP and HIV gp41 FP1858.",

Interestingly, immunosuppressive activity of the influenza FP has been recently demonstrated in vitro59. Further, we suggested before that: 1) short synthetic peptides (SCHOOL peptides) can be designed in line with the SCHOOL platform-based strategy for therapeutic inhibition and modulation of a variety of functionally unrelated multichain receptors expressed on various cells, and 2) the molecular mechanisms of action of the SCHOOL peptides is similar to those that viruses use to evade the immune system264344. To date, the SCHOOL peptides that target TREM-1, glycoprotein receptor VI (GPVI), and TCR were demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo to represent promising therapeutic approaches to the treatment of a variety of diseases with unmet clinical need including sepsis, lung cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatoses, and others3334525860. Taken together, these findings further support our unifying hypothesis2944 that the viral immune evasion strategies developed and optimized during millions of years of evolution of virus-host interactions can be practically used for the rational drug design of new mechanism-based therapies.",

Daily clinical scores were given on a scale of 0\u20135 for each of the paws (right front, left front, right rear, left rear) on days 24\u201338 using the following criteria: 0 = normal; 1 = one hind or fore paw joint affected or minimal diffuse erythema and swelling; 2 = two hind or fore paw joints affected or mild diffuse erythema and swelling; 3 = three hind or fore paw joints affected or moderate diffuse erythema and swelling; 4 = four hind or fore paw joints affected or marked diffuse erythema and swelling; 5 = entire paw affected, severe diffuse erythema and severe swelling, unable to flex digits. On day 38, mice were humanely euthanized for necropsy. Mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane and bled by cardiac puncture. Serum was prepared and stored frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C for cytokine analysis.",

Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) are shown as spheres and are colored accordingly by subunit. The recognition and signaling subunits are bound together by electrostatic transmembrane (TM) interactions. These TM interactions occur between basic and acidic amino acid residues. The TCR\u03b1 transmembrane domain (TMD) contains two basic residues: a lysine, which interacts with two acidic residues of aspartic acid present in the TMDs of the CD3\u03b5\u03b4 heterodimer, and an arginine, which interacts with two aspartic acid residues present in the TMDs of the \u03b6\u03b6 homodimer. The TCR\u03b2 TMD contains a lysine, which interacts with one aspartic acid residue and one acidic residue of glutamic acid present in the TMDs of the CD3\u03b5\u03b3 heterodimer.
