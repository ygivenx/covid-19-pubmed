The ORF 7a gene is conserved in all SARS-CoV strains [8], and sequence analysis predicts that ORF 7a encodes a type I transmembrane protein. The crystal structure of the luminal domain of the 7a protein has been resolved, revealing a structure unexpectedly similar in fold and topology to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily [9]. It has been demonstrated that 7a is incorporated into SARS-CoV particles by interacting with viral structural proteins E and M [10,11]. In addition, 7a interacts with the viral proteins 3a and S [10,12], and these proteins may form a complex during viral infection.",

Over-expression of ORF 7a induces apoptosis via the caspase-dependent pathway [13] and inhibits cellular protein synthesis by activation of p38 MAPK [14]. The induction of apoptosis by the 7a protein is dependent on its interaction with the Bcl-XL protein and other pro-survival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1 and A1) [15]. In addition, 7a can block cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase via the cyclin D3/pRb pathway [16]. Also, interaction between 7a and hSGT (human small glutamine-rich tetricopeptide repeat containing protein) has been demonstrated although the biological significance of this interaction needs to be further elucidated [17]. Taken together, these observations suggest that the 7a protein interacts with several host cell proteins and may play a role in the SARS-CoV pathogenesis.",

It is an asymmetrically-cleaving enzyme, catalyzing the reaction (Ap4\u2192ATP+AMP). The intracellular concentration of Ap4A has been shown to increase in cells after heat, oxidative, nutritional or DNA damage stresses [20]. A recent study demonstrated that Ap4A-hydrolase belongs to the transcriptional regulation network in immunologically activated mast cells and that it is involved in regulation of the MITF gene in cardiac cells [21].",

As a negative control, the same protein extracts were immunoprecipitated using an unrelated antibody - mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (Fig. 1, lane 4). Antibody-antigen complexes were immobilized on protein A and G-sepharose bead mixture. The immobilized proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were subsequently analyzed by Western blot, using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody, to detect HA tagged co-immunoprecipitated proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, the HA-tagged 7a protein co-immunoprecipitated with V5-tagged Ap4A-hydrolase. As described earlier [12], the 7a protein was detected in the transfected cells in two forms: unprocessed and processed.

It is well established that over-expression of 7a protein in cultured cells induces apoptosis via increasing level of caspase-3 protease activity [13]. Interestingly, Ap4A is also involved in caspase activation [34]. Elevation of Ap4A level could be achieved by direct up-regulation of the amino-acyl-tRNA synthetases, or down-regulation of the Ap4A-hydrolases, or both, in response to the appropriate signal. Our data indicate that 7a interacts with Ap4A-hydrolase and thus may down-regulate the Ap4A-hydrolase enzymatic activity. Theoretically, this would result in an increase of Ap4A level and contribute to the induction of apoptosis. Further study is required to confirm this hypothesis.",

As for 7a, it has been demonstrated that its expression inhibits phosphorylation of one of the key regulators of cell cycle progression - Rb protein [15]. The hyperphosphorylation of Rb allows activation of E2F family of transcription factors, permitting the transcription of the S phase genes [39]. The inhibition of Rb phosphorylation by 7a suggests that the expression of G1 cyclin/cdk complexes is suppressed.
