Next to antibiotics, vaccines are the best defense that we have to date against infectious diseases; however, no vaccine is actually 100% safe or effective for everyone. This is attributed to the fact that each body reacts to vaccines differently (2\u20134). Significant progress has been made over the years to monitor side effects and conduct research relevant to vaccine safety. In addition, vaccine licensing is a lengthy process that may take 10 years or longer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) require that vaccines undergo the required phases of clinical trials on human subjects prior to any use in the general public. This process is becoming more complex as more caution and care is being allocated to the quality of the market product.",

This will produce a form of the virus that is no longer able to replicate in human cells. However, it will still be recognized by the human immune system, hence protecting the body from future invasions. Examples of such vaccines are measles, rubella, mumps, varicella (more commonly known as chickenpox), and influenza. The disadvantage of using this technique is that the virus may transform into a more virulent form due to a certain mutation and cause illness once injected into the body. Although this rarely occurs, it must always be taken into consideration (6).",

This, however, has not been the case for a few diseases such as tuberculosis where the humoral immunity mounted by the bacille Calmette\u2013Guerin (BCG), the only currently used human vaccine, is inefficient in conferring proper immunization (8). However, T cells do take part indirectly in the production of antibodies and of secreted biological molecules (e.g., Interferon) for protection. It seems that a proper mounted immunity is better achieved by vaccine-induced antibodies, whereas a T cell immune response is needed for disease attenuation. Hence, a robust understanding of B and T cell function is needed for proper immunization (9).",

In the context of primary vaccination, this causes reduced response rate (7\u201312). B cells also undergo age-related changes that aggravate the functionality of B cells colonies. As effector B cells accumulate, na\u00efve B cells decrease in number and this leads to a reduction in the diversity of antibody responses.

Vaccination program efficiency is proportional to vaccine potency or efficacy in addition to the degree and success of immunization of the target groups in the population. In brief, it is influenced by other non-vaccine-related factors that could influence the outcome.

Translating research data into real public health application are a process that has been reengineered by the NIH as part of a road map for future research. Consequently, a new expanded definition of translational research, consisting of four steps was proposed, which fits nicely within the continuum of vaccine research (21). In this new process of phase I to phase IV clinical trials, safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, and post-licensure effectiveness of a particular vaccine are assessed ending up in phase IV with the burden of the disease (15).",

Another method used for inoculation was the removal of fluid from the pustules of an infected individual and subsequently rubbing it into a skin scratch of a healthy individual. This procedure was later introduced into Turkey around 1672, long before reaching Europe (25). It took six centuries for variolation to be introduced to Great Britain, in 1721 (26).",

Jenner became interested in certain individuals who were immune to smallpox because they had contracted cowpox in the past. He personally witnessed this when he learned of a dairymaid that was immune to smallpox due to her previous infection with the cowpox virus, usually transmitted from infected cattle. During that time, an English farmer named Benjamin Jesty personally took charge of inoculating his wife and children with fresh matter from a cowpox lesion in one of his cows out of fear of having his wife and children become victims of the smallpox epidemic. He applied this method after having contracted cowpox himself and believing he was immune to smallpox. He never published his results even though his wife and children did not show symptoms after being exposed to smallpox (27). During these years, there were still outbreaks of smallpox. George Washington, after surviving smallpox, ordered mandatory inoculation for his troops in 1777 (27).",

After several days, Jenner inoculated the boy again but this time with fresh matter from a smallpox lesion and noted that the boy did not acquire the disease proving that he was completely protected (27).

Dr. Jean de Carro, for example, aided in the elimination of variolation and its substitution with vaccination. Some of the major efforts implemented in America were initiated by Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, who received the vaccine from Edward Jenner and vaccinated his own family. He later proved that they acquired immunity when they remained asymptomatic after he infected them with smallpox. Waterhouse worked effectively on making vaccination universal in the U.S. Unfortunately, like any other medical breakthrough, problems arose both because Waterhouse aimed at making profit and the public was not ready to implement these procedures. However, after breaking his initial monopoly, Waterhouse accepted to share his vaccines and made the supplies available to other physicians (24). Despite all these efforts, smallpox epidemics continued to occur and Jenner stated in a pamphlet that he wrote, \u201cThe annihilation of the small pox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final result of this practice.\u201d Eradication was finally achieved 176 years later. The time it took could be attributed to the fact that Jenner did not think of the necessity of revaccination nor of the instability of vaccines, which made them unable to handle different environmental conditions, including countries other than England (30).",

Louis Pasteur (1822\u20131895), a French chemist and microbiologist, was the first to propose the \u201cGerm Theory\u201d of disease in addition to discovering the foundations of vaccination (26). He studied chicken cholera and received strains of bacteria causing anthrax and septic Vibrio. Pasteur started his experiments by intentionally infecting chickens by feeding them cholera-polluted meals and then recording the fatal progression of the illness. At first, Pasteur was using fresh cultures of the bacteria to inoculate the chickens, most of which did not survive. During that time, Pasteur had to go on a holiday, so he placed his assistant in charge of injecting the chickens with fresh cultures. However, his assistant accidentally forgot to perform the injections, and the bacterial cultures were left in a medium that was exposed to room air for about a month. Later, the attendant injected the chickens with the now \u201cattenuated\u201d strain of bacteria resulting in mild, non-fatal symptoms. Pasteur later re-injected these chickens, but this time with fresh bacteria. To his surprise, they did not get ill. Ultimately, Pasteur reasoned that what made the bacteria less deadly was exposure to air, mainly oxygen. Pasteur used the French verb \u201cvacciner\u201d during the years 1879 and 1880 to describe how he was able to provide total body immunity through vaccination by inoculation of an attenuated virulence which was the first vaccine made by a human in the laboratory (31).",

During the same year, Louis Pasteur in France and George Miller Sternberg in the U.S. almost simultaneously and independently isolated and grew the pneumococcus organism. Later in 1884, Pasteur successfully fought rabies that was endangering the European livestock by using his attenuated rabies vaccine obtained from desiccated brain tissue inactivated with formaldehyde, which provided immunity to dogs against rabies in his experiments (26). He reported his success to the Academy of Sciences in France, and a year later, he applied his original vaccine 60 h after a 9-year-old boy was bitten several times by a rabid dog. The boy survived after being first inoculated with the most attenuated organisms, then subsequently with less attenuated organisms each day for 10 days (33). In 1888, the Pasteur Institute was established as a rabies treatment center as well as an infectious diseases research and training institute.",

However, the first killed vaccine for cholera was developed in 1896 by Wilhelm Kolle (1868\u20131935) and was used in Japan in 1902 with over 80% efficiency.

In 1907, it was demonstrated that toxoids could be used to durably immunize guinea pigs. It is crucial to briefly address the historical background of the bacterial infections that led to some of the earliest and most successful use of toxoids, inactivated forms of bacterial toxins, for the purpose of immunization. Until the twentieth century, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis proved to be significant causes of illness and death with no effective treatments or prevention in sight. Fortunately, advances in 1890 improved the prognosis of numerous future patients (35). At the end of the nineteenth century, especially in 1896 and 1897, the cholera and typhoid vaccines were developed, followed by the introduction of the plague vaccine.

His discovery led to the development of passive serum therapies through the scientific contributions of many, including Emil Von Behring and Paul Ehrlich (26). Similarly, the etiological agent of Pertussis, commonly known as the \u201cwhooping cough,\u201d was found to be a bacterium isolated from infected patient tissues in 1906 (36). Tetanus was similarly a significant cause of mortality usually resulting from dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system or the respiratory muscles (37). In 1884, another German scientist, Arthur Nicolaier (1862\u20131942), correlated tetanus with an anaerobic soil bacterium found in wounds. A few years later, the Japanese investigator Shibasaburo Kitasato (1853\u20131931) was able to isolate this bacterium (35). At the beginning of World War I in 1914, the tetanus toxoid was introduced following the development of an effective therapeutic serum against tetanus by Emil Von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato. The rabies and typhoid vaccines were then licensed in the U.S. as the etiology of these destructive diseases was slowly being uncovered, by Shibasaburo Kitasato along with Emil von Behring (26). They discovered that the serum of animals that had been exposed to sub-lethal doses of the bacteria involved in tetanus and diphtheria was protective against the lethal effects associated with these pathogens by having an antitoxin effect when injected into another animal. Additionally, this discovery, which earned Behring the inaugural Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1901, was the concept of passive transfer in addition to serum therapy. He proved that serum could be acquired from immune animals and transferred to others as protection (38). Once this concept made its way to clinical practice in 1891, technical problems were faced while developing the right antitoxin concentration and potency. As a result, in the early twentieth century, the U.S. Congress enacted the Biologics Control Act legislation \u201cto regulate the sale of viruses, serums, toxins, and similar products\u201d to ensure medication quality control. Nevertheless, with the increasing use and popularity of antitoxins derived from animal serum, scientists began to observe a syndrome now called serum sickness, or a reaction to immune-complexes formed from combining high concentrations of antigens with antibodies. This eventually led to the use of human rather than animal serum in order to decrease the frequency of adverse events; still, serum therapy was not perfect in preventing disease due to the frequency of adverse events and its brief duration of action. Later on, combining diphtheria toxin and antitoxin in the same syringe proved much more effective in decreasing mortality rate. This combination became commercially available in 1897. This was the first step in the shift from passive to active immunization (35). In 1923, Gaston Ramon (1886\u20131963), a French veterinarian working at the Pasteur Institute, used a diphtheria toxoid produced by formalin and heat inactivation without the use of antitoxin to safely induce active immunity in humans. This product, termed anatoxine, was the basis for the novel and clinically effective toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. Experiments followed to improve the durability of the protective response of the vaccine, and in 1926, the importance of aluminum salts as an adjuvant added to the vaccine to augment the immune response to the antigen, became apparent (38). This was discovered by Alexander Thomas Glenny (1882\u20131965) who proved that toxoid alone produced a lower level of antibody and immunity than desired, whereas better immunity was achieved when an inflammatory reaction was triggered. With these significant improvements, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids became routinely used across America and Europe in the 1930s and 1940s (35).",

Reed\u2019s experiments took Finlay\u2019s discovery one step further by adding an incubation period of approximately 2 weeks and achieved the same positive results. When mosquitos bite non-immune individuals after feeding on individuals who had yellow fever, none of the non-immune subjects died and very few suffered disease. This led the Commission of investigators to a major discovery, namely, the identification of the Asibi strain, which is the parent strain of the present 17D vaccine, obtained via continuous indirect passage through the Aegypti mosquitos and direct passage through monkeys. In addition to identifying the etiological agent of the disease, the Commission also identified rhesus monkeys as susceptible hosts, hence providing a means for testing future vaccine attempts. This paved the way for Max Theiler and other Rockefeller Foundation scientists to develop a successful live-attenuated vaccine for yellow fever in 1937. \u201cThe most important experimental passage series \u2013 designated 17D \u2013 used a virus that had been subcultured eighteen times in whole mouse embryos, followed by 58 passages in whole-minced chick embryo cultures, after which the virus was passed in minced chick embryo depleted of nervous tissue.\u201d Theiler himself was actually one of the first individuals to be successfully vaccinated. The vaccine was quickly implemented, and alternative vaccines shown to be more dangerous were discontinued (42).",

It was not until the early twentieth century that influenza outbreaks began to be systematically studied due to well-documented clinical descriptions and epidemiological data. In 1918, the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d influenza pandemic was responsible for 25\u201350 million deaths worldwide and more than one-half million in the U.S. This virus was unusual because it spread so quickly, was so deadly (26). Richard E. Shope (1901\u20131966), a physician who conducted his research in the Department of Animal Pathology at The Rockefeller Institute in Princeton, was the first to isolate influenza virus; a member of the orthomyxovirus family, from a mammalian host in 1931 (43). He was able to induce the syndrome of swine influenza in pigs by applying respiratory secretions intranasally. He also isolated a bacterium from the respiratory tract of infected pigs called Haemophilus influenzae suis. When this bacterium was combined with a filterable agent and inoculated, the pigs developed the clinical manifestations of swine influenza. These two agents seemed to act synergistically with the virus to damage the respiratory tract hence creating the suitable environment needed for the virus to exercise its pathological effects. In 1933, scientists from the British National Institute for Medical Research including Christopher Andrews, Wilson Smith, and Patrick Laidlaw successfully isolated and transmitted the influenza virus from humans. Throughout this year, \u201cBurnet has successfully cultivated the organism in chick embryos; other influenza types had been recognized; neutralizing antibodies had been identified and quantitated; and viral surface glycoproteins, H and N had been described\u201d (43).",

It is a disease of the developed nations striking younger individuals most frequently in warmer weather. One of the most famous polio victims, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis in 1938, later known as the March of Dimes (26). It is well established that better hygiene decreases childhood exposure to the disease, when infection would usually be milder since protective maternal antibodies are present (45). In 1954, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Fredrick Robbins for their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in tissue cultures (26). Two major lifelong competitors were involved in the race for the Polio vaccine, Jonas Salk (1914\u20131995) and Albert Sabin (1906\u20131993). Salk took a more traditional route using a killed-virus approach, which did not involve natural infection in acquiring immunity. Instead, his approach involved a fully inactivated virus that still had the ability to induce protective antibodies. Sabin, on the other hand, set out to create a live-virus vaccine based on the belief that this would trigger natural immunity and provide a lasting protection. Salk had speed, simplicity, and safety on his side since a killed-virus did not have the ability to revert to virulence, whereas the live-virus vaccine could be given orally, establish longer lasting immunity, and offer passive vaccination through the excreted weakened virus potentially immunizing a large portion of non-vaccinated communities (46).",

Following successful clinical trials in 1954, six companies began mass production of the vaccine. Unfortunately, Salk\u2019s vaccines were soon suspended and recalled when contaminated samples were found in the market due to poor monitoring and control in some laboratories leading to serious health consequences and national panic. The first Cutter polio vaccine incident was reported on April 25, 1955 with 5 more cases reported just a day later with the number eventually rising to 94 of those vaccinated and in 166 of their close contacts. On April 27, the Laboratory of Biologics Control requested that Cutter Laboratories recall all vaccines and the company did so immediately. On May 7, the Surgeon General recommended that all polio vaccinations be suspended pending inspection of each manufacturing facility and thorough review of the procedures for testing vaccine safety. The investigation found that live polio virus had survived in two batches of vaccines produced by Cutter Laboratories. Large-scale polio vaccinations resumed in the fall of 1955 (26). At the same time, Sabin had been making great advances with his live-virus vaccine since 1951. After successful clinical trials conducted in the Soviet Union that left polio virtually wiped out with no safety issues, it soon became the vaccine of choice in the West. The Polio Vaccination Assistance Act was enacted by Congress and was the first federal involvement in immunization activities. It allowed Congress to appropriate funds to the Communicable Diseases Center [later the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)] to help states and local communities acquire and administer vaccines. At the beginning of the 1960s, the oral polio vaccine types 1, 2, and 3 as well as the trivalent product were licensed in the U.S. The first 2 were developed by Sabin and grown in monkey kidney cell culture, while the trivalent oral polio was developed to improve upon the killed Salk vaccine (26). As a result, in the late 1990s, the CDC recommended switching back to Salk\u2019s killed-virus polio vaccine, while the WHO also advocated the switch for polio-free nations and the continued use of the favored live-virus vaccine for routine immunization (45).",

A formalin-inactivated measles virus vaccine derived from this strain was subsequently licensed in the U.S. in 1963. However, following the discontinuation of this vaccine in 1967 due to short-lived and incomplete immunity, over 20 further attenuated vaccines were developed and used throughout the world, most of which were also derived from the Edmonston strain (48). The first live-virus measles vaccine, Rubeovax, was licensed in 1963. Other live-attenuated virus measles vaccines were eventually licensed in the U.S. in 1965. The recommended age for routine administration was changed from 9 to 12 months of age.",

Hilleman isolated the wild type virus from his daughter, Jeryl Lynn, who contracted the virus at the age of 5 and was recovering from it. It became known as the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus.

Maurice Hilleman discovered the superior RA 27/3 vaccine that became the only vaccine used outside of Japan starting in the late 1970s. This vaccine maintained its preference due to many factors including increased durability and harmlessness to fetuses of inadvertently vaccinated pregnant women (47). In 1969, three rubella virus strains were licensed in the U.S.: HPV-77 strain grown in dog-kidney culture, HPV-77 grown in duck-embryo culture, and Cendehill strain grown in rabbit-kidney culture. A decade later, in 1979, the RA 27/3 (human diploid fibroblast) strain of rubella vaccine (Meruvax II) by Merck was licensed. All other strains were discontinued. Merck\u2019s combined trivalent MMR as well as the combined measles and rubella vaccine (M-RVax) developed by Maurice Hilleman and colleagues, was licensed by the U.S. government in 1971 (26), and is still in use today. Moreover, the age for routine vaccination with MMR vaccine was changed from 12 to 15 months in the year of 1976. The next vaccine that combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella antigens (Proquad) was licensed in 2005. It was indicated for use in children 12 months to 12 years. In response to the association of this vaccine with autism, in 2004, the eighth and final report of the Immunization Safety Review Committee was issued by the Institute of Medicine concluded that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism (26). Combination vaccines hold many advantages including reduced need for several injections, therefore, reducing the incidence of vaccination site reaction (48).",

The discovery of the surface antigen particles of the hepatitis B virus by Blumberg and colleagues in the plasma of human carriers was followed by attempts to create a vaccine. In 1968, a killed hepatitis B vaccine was developed and clinical trials began in 1975 proving the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Merck and Pasteur Institute subsequently independently licensed the plasma-derived vaccine in 1981 (50). On July 23rd 1986, the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax HB) was licensed. Using recombinant DNA technology, Merck scientists developed a hepatitis B surface antigen subunit vaccine. Three years later, on August 28th 1989, the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) was licensed. A decade later in 1999, the FDA approved a two-dose schedule of hepatitis B vaccination for adolescents 11\u201315 years of age using Recombivax HB (by Merck) with the 10-\u03bcg (adult) dose at 0 and 4\u20136 months later.

The following year, a vaccine combining diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated polio, and hepatitis B antigens (Pediarix) was licensed (26).

Michiaki Takahashi, Professor of Virology at the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases at Osaka University, successfully produced the Oka vaccine strain of live, attenuated varicella vaccine in the 1970s. Takahashi was able to make this remarkable advance at a time when very few viruses had been attenuated to produce efficacious live-virus vaccines including yellow fever, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella as previously mentioned. The VZV vaccine is the first and only licensed live, attenuated herpesvirus vaccine in the world. Numerous trials in the early 1970s continued to prove the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in both healthy and immunocompromised, high-risk individuals. As a result of these successful trials, the live varicella virus vaccine (Varivax) was licensed in 1995 for the active immunization of persons 12 months of age and older (51). About 10 years later, in 2006, VariZIG, a new immune globulin product for post-exposure prophylaxis of varicella, became available under an Investigational New Drug Application Expanded Access Protocol (26).",

No significant difference was found in the incidence of rotavirus in industrialized and developing countries, suggesting that vaccination may be the only way to control the impact of this severe disease. Dr. Ruth Bishop and colleagues were the first to describe rotavirus in humans in 1973. It was clear, early on, that a naturally acquired first infection, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, was the most effective defense against severe reinfection, and subsequent infections progressively created greater protection. Therefore, the goal was to create a vaccination that mimicked the effectiveness of naturally acquired immunity following infection. The development of live, attenuated, oral, safe, and effective rotavirus vaccines was then attempted starting in the mid-1970s. Dr. Albert Kapikian and colleagues, at the NIH, developed the RRV strain that was subsequently used to develop the RRV-TV, or the RotaShield, live oral, and tetravalent vaccine licensed in 1998 to be used in infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (26). However, due to several reported cases of vaccine-associated intestinal intussusception, RotaShield was pulled off the market in the U.S. 14 months after its introduction on the 16th of October, 1999. In 2004, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, awarded a new license agreement for RotaShield to BIOVIRx, Inc. of Minneapolis, MN, USA, which planned its global commercialization. In 2011, history of intussusception was added as a contraindication for rotavirus vaccination (26). Clark, Offit, and Plotkin then produced the RotaTeq vaccine by Merck based on their bovine strain WC3 in 1992, which was licensed in 2006 by the U.S. FDA. This vaccine, live oral and pentavalent, is destined for use in infants ages 6\u201332 weeks (26). Another vaccine, Rotarix, was also licensed in 2008. It is a liquid given in a two-dose series to infants from 6 to 24 weeks of age. Before being licensed, both vaccines were shown to be safe and effective in rigorous clinical trials (52).",

Such emerging diseases represent a major public health concern; they affect livestock and humans thus threatening the world\u2019s economy and public health.

Novel methods to rapidly develop vaccine are being experimented, whereby investigators are working to achieve a better understanding of the nature of the interactions between the immune system and a panel of novel harmful microbes. On this basis several novel strategies have been developed and applied. Such strategies included the use of (1) recombinant proteins, or nanoparticles like in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, (2) synthetic peptides like the case of influenza virus, (3) virus-like particles, (4) multimeric presentation of viral antigens like the case of Hepatitis, (5) replication of competent viral vectors like in the Rift Valley Fever virus or the EBOLA viruses, (6) recombinant bacteria for Listeria and Salmonella among others, and (7) nucleic acid vaccines for EBOLA or Dengue or Rift Valley Fever viruses (54).",

Another emerging disease, MERS-CoV, has caused the death of around 36% of people reported to have contracted the disease. Another disease with high health and economic burden would be rotavirus which was estimated to have annual direct and indirect costs of around $1 billion with \u201cmore than 400,000 physician visits, more than 200,000 emergency department (ED) visits, 55,000 to 70,000 hospitalizations, and 20 to 60 deaths each year in children younger than 5 years\u201d (CDC, 2015).

On the other hand, the influenza virus which was estimated to cause an average of 23,607 deaths annually with a $12 billion cost of an epidemic, showed that with the introduction of its vaccine, studies proved it to be 80% effective in preventing death (55).

Through reviewing the factsheets provided by the World Health Organization, which provide statistical data on the mortality and morbidity percentages before and after the introduction of the vaccines, one can comprehend the vital role vaccines have played up till this day. Some of the figures that depict the impact of vaccines in decreasing mortality and morbidity include more than 99% decrease in Polio cases since 1988, with cases reaching 350,000 from over 125 endemic countries down to 359 cases as reported in 2014 with only 2 endemic countries, measles vaccine has prevented the death of around 15.6 million children during 2000\u20132013, in general vaccines prevent around 6 million deaths annually worldwide (57). This success in providing better public health does not negate the economic burden of vaccination. Vaccination programs require excessive funding to ensure proper handling and maintenance of vaccines, adequate staffing and ongoing provision over efficacy and safety of vaccines and the development of newer vaccines (58). Nevertheless, the economic and social burden related to the expenses in hospitalizing affected unvaccinated people still outweighs the aforementioned burden. Moreover, better health in the society would promote economic growth and productivity. Consequently, public awareness and public efforts agree on the importance of vaccination and the implementation of policies regarding mandatory vaccinations as a way to decrease outbreaks of preventable diseases and improve global health and prosperity.",

As with any new medical intervention there are safety concerns that arise which might be deleterious to the public health. Concerns regarding vaccines often follow a path that starts with the hypothesis of a potential adverse event that is impulsively announced to the public without having reproducible studies to confirm this hypothesis, and thus it would take the public several years to regain trust in the vaccine. A notable example in the recent history would be of the paper published by Andrew Wakefield in the British medical journal the Lancet in 1998, linking the MMR vaccine to autism. However, his research was discredited and the paper was retracted from the journal after it was proven that actually there is no link between MMR vaccine and autism as per the systemic review by the Cochrane library (59). The battle against vaccines did not reach a halt, and there are still ongoing campaigns that come from religious, political, community-based, and even individual-based grounds raising even ethical issues regarding the mandatory vaccinations proposed by the government. According to the CDC, this year 95% of the children were vaccinated in the U.S., leaving 5% unvaccinated due to religious and philosophical exemptions or even parental refusal due to the fear of vaccine\u2019s side effects and concerns regarding autism from vaccines (60); this is still a critical number since the unvaccinated would pose risk of outbreaks even among the immunized, which necessitates the need for additional awareness campaigns regarding the importance of vaccination since vaccines remain the only plausible measure of protection against preventable diseases. Actually, a trend was reported in the health news lately, in the U.S., that pediatricians refuse to offer medical care for children whose parents declined their vaccination.",

The importance of vaccine safety continued to grow throughout the twenty-first century, with the development and licensure of new vaccines added to the already robust immunization armamentarium. Scientists also perfected new ways of administering immunizations including edible vaccines and needleless injections.
