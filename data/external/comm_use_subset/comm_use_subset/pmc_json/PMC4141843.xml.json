According to the most recent release of the Universal Virus Database of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the genus Circovirus consists of eleven recognized species, including Porcine circovirus 1 (PCV-1), Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), Canary circovirus (CaCV), Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), and other viruses of domestic and wild birds (http://ictvdb.bio-mirror.cn/Ictv/fs_circo.htm).

On the bases of the similarity with other circoviruses, the origin of replication site for strain Bari/411\u201313 was predicted to consist of a palindromic sequence that includes dodecanucleotide pairs in the stem, whereas the loop is formed by the decanucleotide motif CATAGTATTA.
