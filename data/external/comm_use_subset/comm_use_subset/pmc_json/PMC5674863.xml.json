            "text": "Canine parvovirus diseases, caused by canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), is highly contagious and prevalent worldwide in domestic and wild canids. CPV-2 emerged as a novel pathogen in 1978 and spread rapidly worldwide [1, 2]. Within a few years, the original type 2 virus underwent a rapid and extensive evolution, and was replaced by two antigenic types, termed CPV-2a and CPV-2b. Recently, a new antigenic variant, CPV-2c, was reported in dogs [3]. CPV-2 is a small non-enveloped, linear single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family Parvoviridae, genus Parvovirus, and is considered as a major cause for large numbers of animal deaths worldwide [4]. CPV2-infected dogs are characterized by a gastroenteritis disorder with clinical signs of anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, fever and diarrhea (from mucoid to hemorrhagic) [5, 6]. Because of infection and damage to the bone marrow, parvovirus can also cause acute leukopenia with lymphopenia and neutropenia. When CPV-2 shed into the feces, it can be spread by direct oral or nasal contact. Furthermore, CPV-2 is extremely stable in the environment and can survive for several months. Therefore, early, rapid and accurate diagnosis of CPV-2 infection would help veterinarians to implement appropriate strategies in time to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks, particularly within a shelter environment.",

            "text": "Several traditional diagnosis methods exist for CPV-2, including direct observation by electron microscopy, virus isolation in a suitable cell culture system, serological tests such as the latex agglutination test (LAT), hemaghaemagglutination (HA) test, ELISA and so on. These methods are often time-consuming, laborious, and have low sensitivity [7, 8]. With the advances in molecular detection techniques, a substantial number of gene amplification-based assays have been described for CPV-2 diagnosis such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR, reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) [9\u201315]. Among these methods, nested PCR, real-time PCR and RT-LAMP have shown high sensitivity. However, due to the requirement of an expensive thermocycler and well-experienced technicians, implementation of these assays is limited in the field and at the point- of -care (POC). The iiPCR method was reported for its sensitive detection of CPV-2, but the reaction time was about 60 min [9]. In addition, the SNAP test based on ELISA protocols for detection of viral antigens is commonly used for CPV-2 diagnosis and can be completed in about 8 min by employing the commercial kit, whereas PCR seems to be more sensitive than SNAP [8, 13, 16, 17]. Recently we reported on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) as a rapid, specific, sensitive and cost-effective molecular method for POC diagnosis of CPV-2 infection [18].",

The diagnostic performance of the real-time RPA assay to detect CPV-2 in the 91 clinical swab samples was compared to that of the real-time PCR. These two assays showed the same results (76 positive and 15 negative cases), and further analysis demonstrated that the real-time RPA had a diagnostic agreement of 100% with the real-time PCR (Table 3). No discrepancy was found in samples (14/76) containing low levels of CPV-2 DNA (Ct > 35, real-time PCR), indicating that the established real-time RPA reliably detected low amounts of CPV-2 in clinical samples. Positive samples had real-time RPA Ct values ranging from 17.52 to 36.29, indicating that the method was able to detect CPV-2 DNA across the entire range of the assay. Twenty-three positive samples were selected randomly, and the threshold time (TT) and cycle threshold (Ct) values of real-time RPA and real-time PCR, respectively, were well correlated with an R2 value of 0.846 (Fig. 3). The relative sensitivity of the real-time RPA assay was further evaluated by comparing with the SNAP test. A total of 30 fecal swab samples were collected for this experiment. Twenty-four of the above tested clinical samples displayed CPV-2 positive, six of them were CPV-2 negative by real-time PCR assay. The result showed that the SNAP test was able to detect CPV antigen in 16/30 (53.3%) of analyzed samples. A higher detection rate (24/30, 80%) was obtained using real-time RPA for CPV-2 DNA. The relative sensitivity of the SNAP test was 66.7% (16/24), when compared to real-time RPA. The best correlation was observed again between conventional real-time PCR and real-time RPA analysis (shown in the Additional file 1: Table S1). The detection results of the swab samples showed that the real-time RPA method we developed was effective in detecting CPV-2.\n\n",

            "text": "In this study, a real-time RPA method was developed based on an exo probe for the rapid and sensitive detection of CPV-2. With real-time RPA, only CPV-2a and CPV-2b among multiple viruses infectious to canines tested could be amplified, demonstrating the high specificity of this assay (Fig. 1). Using the CPV-2 plasmid DNA as a template, it was detected between 4 and 12 min for 105\u2013101 copies of DNA (Fig. 2a). The limit of detection of the real-time assay was 101 copies/reaction, which was 10 times higher than that of the conventional RPA [18]. Further validation of this method was performed using clinical samples. The detection rate of the real-time RPA assay was comparable of that of the real-time PCR, although the former assay was much faster than the latter. The real-time RPA assay detected the positive samples within 4\u201312 min. While the CPV-2 detection results by real-time RPA could be obtained in about 30 min including the time for nucleic acid extraction, the reaction time for positive samples reached up to 1 h with real-time PCR. Additionally, the cost per reaction performed in the real-time RPA, real-time PCR assays and commercial SNAP tests including the cost of the reagents and the samples preparation was about 4.3, 6.0 and 5.0 US dollars, respectively. The cost of real-time RPA decreased 28.33%, when the method was compared to real-time PCR, and 14% respectively, when compared to SNAP tests. RPA has been widely explored for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens, including H7N9 virus and Dengue virus infection, and real field testing also has been achieved [23, 24]. Moreover, the portable POC tube scanner (Genie III, OptiGene Limited, West Sussex, United Kingdom) used in the study, weighing only 1.75 kg with the dimensions of 25 cm \u00d7 16.5 cm \u00d7 8.5 cm, is much more simple and less expensive than a real-time PCR machine and can be run on battery power for use in the field. For CPV-2, it is often sufficient to simply boil the fecal samples before running diagnostic PCR. In our subsequent experiments we obtained similar results using boiling only to extract CPV-2 from clinical samples. In recent years, a number of isothermal DNA amplification methods have been developed as a simple, rapid technique alternative to PCR-based amplification. In the LAMP assay for the rapid and sensitive detection of CPV-2, a set of four primers was needed, and the optimum time and temperature were 60 min and 65 \u00b0C, respectively [12]. The developed iiPCR could detect as low as 13 copies of CPV-2 DNA in about 60 min [9]. For the real-time RPA assay described in this work, 101 copies of CPV-2 DNA could be detected in 4 min, which was much more rapid than the above assays, including the common RPA assay. Compared to other isothermal amplification techniques, RPA does not require initial heating for DNA denaturation, and the results can be obtained in less than 12 min. The major advantages of RPA compared with other isothermal DNA amplification methods are that it (1) shows a certain degree of tolerance to common PCR inhibitors, (2) can tolerate a wide range of biological samples [19] and (3) utilizes reagents stored in lyophilized pellets, which are very stable and can react satisfactory at 25 \u00b0C for up to 12 weeks and at 45 \u00b0C for up to 3 weeks [25]. The SNAP test based on ELISA protocols for rapid detection of viral antigen is commonly used for CPV-2 clinical diagnosis, but it is less sensitive than RCR-based methods, especially RAP assay we developed in this study. The lower sensitivity of the SNAP test is generally associated with the host immune response, such as the very small amounts of virus shed in the feces during the late stage of infection and/or the presence of high CPV antibody titres in the gut lumen and so on. In our RPA assay, the detecting target was the nucleic acid of CPV-2. The virus-specific gene was amplified first, and its amplification products were tested. In this process, the detection signal is magnified hundreds of thousands of times. More importantly, it is not affected by the host immune response. One limitation of our assay is that it fails to distinguish CPV-2 vaccine from wild type stains. If vaccine strain is shed post vaccination it will be detected by this assay. All in all, these distinguishing features of the RPA assay and hands-on experience of real field testing using RPA from other research groups make us believe that RPA could work well in a clinical diagnostic setting. It may also be the most applicable approach for the field and POC diagnosis of infectious diseases.",
