            "text": "Fundamental to understanding dynamics of infectious disease in populations is an appreciation of the force of infection (FOI), defined as the per capita rate at which susceptible individuals acquire infection (Anderson & May, 1991; Muench, 1959). This is driven by two critical components: the rate of contact and probability of transmission given a contact. It also depends on the number of infectious individuals in the population. In general, precise measurements of pathogen transmission are challenging to establish because of the considerable difficulties associated with identifying the nature of a potential contact and the probability of infection (McCallum, Barlow, & Hone, 2001). Additionally, heterogeneities in transmission can arise, for example due to age\u2010 or sex\u2010specific differences among individuals, or in different geographic locations. Estimating the FOI can elucidate the transmission process and offer insight into how disease is spread; this can help us better manage disease by understanding the subpopulations most at risk of infection.",

Age\u2010specific FOI estimates show the risk of infection with respect to age: the risk of infection could be constant across a lifetime, could increase or decrease with age, or could peak or dip at a certain age. Age\u2010specific FOI estimates can therefore help identify age classes most at risk of becoming infected and may highlight likely transmission routes. Using age\u2010prevalence data to estimate the FOI has the additional advantage of enabling the disease\u2010associated mortality rate to be estimated, hence establishing a more complete picture of the foothold of a disease on a population. Disease\u2010associated mortality is the increase in mortality hazard resulting from becoming infected, relative to an animal that remains susceptible.",

            "text": "Lentiviruses, a genus of the Retroviridae, cause persistent infection that results in chronic and sometimes deadly disease. These viruses are widespread, forming species\u2010specific infections in primates, felids, ungulates, and humans (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus or HIV). Lentiviral transmission is dominated by sexual contacts and blood transfusions for humans, and through aggressive encounters for wildlife. HIV infection results in a gradual depletion of CD4 T\u2010lymphocytes, eventually compromising the host immune system and ultimately resulting in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a feline analogue of HIV, and both domestic and wild cats can become infected with species\u2010specific forms (Troyer et al., 2005). Infection by FIV in felids seems to result in a continuum of disease effects. Domestic cats are affected by FIVFca, which in some cases can result in disease symptoms including immunodepression, similar to HIV infection in humans (B\u0229czkowski et al., 2015; Diehl, Mathiason\u2010Dubard, O'Neil, Obert, & Hoover, 1995; Pedersen, Ho, Brown, & Yamamoto, 1987). In some instances, FIVFca infection in domestic cats has been reported to lead to mortality (Diehl et al., 1995; Pedersen et al., 1987), although not in other studies (Addie et al., 2000; Hofmann\u2010Lehmann, Holznagel, Ossent, & Lutz, 1997; Liem, Dhand, Pepper, Barrs, & Beatty, 2013). African lions infected with their species\u2010specific form (FIVPle) have been shown to display significant CD4 depletion (Bull et al., 2003; Roelke et al., 2006) and other adverse clinical and immunological outcomes that parallel those caused by lentivirus infection in humans and domestic cats (Roelke et al., 2009). However, there is evidence to suggest that there are also infected lions without overt disease that can have normal life spans and reproduce successfully (Carpenter & O'Brien, 1995; Hofmann\u2010Lehmann et al., 1996; Packer et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The puma (Puma concolor; also called cougar, mountain lion or panther) is a large felid in the Americas that harbors a distinct FIV strain adapted to puma (FIVPco; Lee et al., 2017), with unknown FOI and largely unknown pathology to the host. Pumas are currently found throughout most of South and Central America and in the western part of North America, as well as in a relictual population in southern Florida (Hansen, 1992). FIVPco, hereafter called FIV, is common in pumas across their geographic range (Bevins et al., 2012; Carpenter et al., 1996; Evermann, Foreyt, Hall, & McKeirnan, 1997), with up to 60% of individuals in a population infected (Biek et al., 2003; Biek, Ruth, Murphy, Anderson, & Poss, 2006; Carpenter et al., 1996; Carver et al., 2016; Roelke et al., 1993). Despite its endemic status, the effects of the virus on the health of pumas remain undefined. FIV infection persists throughout the lifetime of the animal (VandeWoude & Apetrei, 2006), and infected pumas exhibit a decline in lymphocytes (Roelke et al., 2006), suggesting immune perturbations are induced during infection similar to other lentiviral infections. Published accounts indicate that FIV\u2010infected puma do not have increased co\u2010exposure to other pathogens (Biek et al., 2006; Gilbertson et al., 2016). A study of pumas from Montana and Wyoming found no evidence for an overall reduction in survival due to infection when accounting for other sources of demographic variation (age, sex and population); however, results from stochastic simulations in this study (Biek et al., 2006) indicated that only larger reductions in annual survival (>20%) could be excluded with confidence. Therefore, the impact of FIV infection on puma mortality is still uncertain.",

This may also increase the understanding of the disease in its other hosts. We use age\u2010prevalence data (based on serology, a marker of infection owing to FIV being chronic and lifelong) to estimate the age\u2010specific FOI of puma FIV. Our specific goals are to determine (a) if and how the FOI depends on age; (b) if the FOI is sex\u2010specific and if it depends on location; and (c) if there is evidence of disease\u2010associated mortality. Because there is a strong positive relationship between puma age and FIV prevalence (Bevins et al., 2012; Biek et al., 2003; Carver et al., 2016; Lewis et al., 2017; Roelke et al., 2006), it can be difficult to determine the effects of FIV on puma; factors that may seem to be increasing with FIV infection may instead be increasing as a result of the pumas aging. Age\u2010prevalence data alone do not accurately measure a disease's impact on a population, as it is subject to the biasing effects of disease\u2010associated mortality. The FOI is a preferred metric to evaluate a disease's foothold (Heisey, Joly, & Messier, 2006), as it adjusts for disease\u2010associated mortality and can show directly how the risk of infection varies with age.",

            "text": "To better understand the risk of FIV infection for puma, it is important to consider the natural history of the species. Pumas are apex predators that exist at low population densities and are considered solitary, except for mothers and cubs in juvenile dependency (Logan & Sweanor, 2001). Pumas can live for up to 15 years and sometimes even 20 years. Contact between adults occurs mainly through mating or during territorial fights among males. In addition, a recent study shows that there is more contact among adult pumas at food resources than previously thought and demonstrates the existence of sophisticated social behaviors such as reciprocity (Elbroch, Levy, Lubell, Quigley, & Caragiulo, 2017). Sexual maturity is reached after 2 years or sometimes earlier for female pumas. Females give birth typically at around 27\u201329 months old (Ashman, Christensen, Hess, Tsukamoto, & Wickersham, 1983; Logan & Sweanor, 2001), with an average litter size of 2 or 3 (Beier, Riley, & Sauvajot, 2010). Kittens are weaned from around two months old. They remain with their mother until becoming independent after 6 months (but usually between 10 and 20 months of age); they disperse out of the mother's home range shortly thereafter (Maehr, Land, Shindle, Bass, & Hoctor, 2002; Sweanor, Logan, & Hornocker, 2000). Almost all male offspring disperse out of the natal population, whereas 50%\u201380% of female offspring remain (Sweanor et al., 2000). Home ranges of adult male pumas are larger, with less overlap among them, compared to those of females (Beier et al., 2010). Fights between adult males and younger male or female pumas are common (Beier et al., 2010) with male pumas having more aggressive interactions than females.",

To determine if the FOI displays such variation, we compare puma in three different locations with contrasting landscape fragmentation and management (southern California, Colorado, and Florida). Southern California puma persist in highly fragmented urban populations; Colorado puma exist in more intact habitat and in some areas are recreationally hunted; while Florida panthers are endangered and have had their population genetically supplemented from Texas puma. Sex is another factor that has been reported to influence FIV prevalence, with male pumas generally more likely to be infected with FIV than females (Bevins et al., 2012). Due to this, we compare the FOI of females and males to determine if this difference in FIV prevalence between the sexes is reflected in the FOI.",

            "text": "In order to estimate the FOI, we test a range of different candidate FOI models. Transmission of FIV occurs via direct contact between individual pumas, although the exact route(s) of transmission are not clear. Our candidate models are flexible and represent a variety of combinations of possible direct transmission modes. If the main transmission routes are aggressive interactions involving biting/fighting (Pontier, Fromont, Courchamp, Artois, & Yoccoz, 1998) and mating (Biek et al., 2003; VandeWoude & Apetrei, 2006), we might expect adults to have a higher FOI than juveniles. This hypothesis is supported by research suggesting that transmission is more common after sexual maturity (as reviewed in VandeWoude & Apetrei, 2006). We might also expect to see a higher FOI for males than females, possibly as a result of males having a higher frequency of aggressive interactions (Beier et al., 2010). Alternatively, if mother to kitten transmission is the main route (perhaps via saliva during grooming or feeding together) we might expect to see a higher FOI in younger animals, prior to independence of offspring. Closely related virus sequences have been isolated from mother\u2013cub puma pairs, suggesting that transmission can occur via contact between mother and kitten (Biek et al., 2003; Carpenter et al., 1996), although this has been considered to occur only rarely (VandeWoude & Apetrei, 2006). Our estimation of the FOI can thus potentially yield important insights into the likelihood of different transmission routes of FIV between pumas.",

Specifically, the three study sites were Orange County in California, Western Slope in Colorado, and southern Florida; descriptions and details of these sites are given in Carver et al. (2016). Pumas were captured and biological samples collected from 1999 to 2013 as part of ongoing research (Bevins et al., 2012; Carver et al., 2016; Troyer et al., 2014). Exposure to FIV was estimated by measuring serum antibodies according to protocols previously described (Bevins et al., 2012; Carver et al., 2016). Puma sex and age were also recorded at capture. Some of the younger pumas in the study were of known age, that is, the approximate birth date was known. For all other animals, age was estimated using a variety of different methods (including those described in Ashman et al., 1983; Laundr\u00e9, Hernndez, Streubel, Altendorf, & Lpez Gonzlez, 2000). This involved assessment of size, weight, dental characteristics, and morphological features (e.g., tail length). Comparing animals to those of known age was useful in deriving age estimates. If the same animal was captured on more than one occasion, we used the result from the most recent capture in our analysis. There were less results for older pumas, so we opted to include the most recent capture in order to maximize the data for older pumas. Kittens were excluded from the study if they tested positive but were younger than 6 months of age (due to the possibility of maternal antibodies being present). There were a total of 209 pumas in the data set (109 females and 100 males).",

Age bins were used rather than separating the data into single year groups, due to the age estimation process not being completely accurate, and to increase the number of animals in each data group. We used broader bins as puma age increased, both because age accuracy tends to be more uncertain as pumas get older, and because there were fewer older pumas in the data set. The age bins were also selected with consideration to the life history of the puma. In addition to analyzing all data together, we separated the data according to sex and then area and sex.",

Considering this range of candidate models ensures that we test a full range of possible shapes for the FOI (including constant, decreasing, increasing curves, and curves with peaks) and hence consider a wide variety of possible different means of FIV transmission. From each candidate FOI, one can derive the predicted age\u2010specific disease prevalence, for two different cases: with and without disease\u2010associated mortality.

In addition, we found 95% confidence intervals using the method of profile likelihood (Caley & Hone, 2002; McCallum, 2000), a method for determining confidence intervals for maximum likelihood estimates, for the parameters of the best models. Pearson residuals were calculated and plotted in GNU Octave to further examine the fit of the best models.",

This supports the idea that transmission can occur both from mothers to kittens (during postweaning period) and also throughout adult life. This is in agreement with the findings of Biek et al. (2003), but implies that transmission from mother to cub is more frequent than previous research suggests (reviewed by VandeWoude & Apetrei, 2006). Note that in utero transmission of FIVFca can occur in domestic cats (O'Neil, Burkhard, Diehl, & Hoover, 1995), but we cannot draw conclusions from our study regarding the possibility of this type of transmission for puma; the youngest animal in our study was 3 months old. For Florida males, the shape of the FOI curve suggests that FIV transmission occurs at a higher rate in the first few years of life (prior to sexual maturity) than in later life, indicating that mother\u2013cub transmission is potentially a particularly important route in this subpopulation. In addition, young males in Florida may have more aggressive encounters; in an examination of the causes of mortality in Florida puma, the majority of animals that died from intraspecific aggression were males under 3 years old (47%; Taylor, Buergelt, Roelke\u2010Parker, Homer, & Rotstein, 2002). It is possible that the apparently common occurrence of fighting among young Florida males may be related to a lack of unoccupied, suitable habitat for dispersing subadults (Maehr, Land, & Roelke, 1991). The risk of infection in older male pumas in Florida is relatively low.",

When the data are separated by sex, the fit of the best models is better than for when we used the data all together. FIV prevalence is higher for males than females in our data set overall (although not in Colorado, possibly as a result of the lack of males over 6 years old in our Colorado population), which is in agreement with other studies (Bevins et al., 2012; Biek et al., 2006) and is also consistent with previous research in domestic cats (Pontier et al., 1998). In each of our three study areas, males have a higher FOI than females, except for older Florida males. This higher risk of infection for males is probably as a result of males having more aggressive contacts (e.g., territorial fights) than females (Beier et al., 2010; Logan & Sweanor, 2001). California has the lowest FIV prevalence and the lowest FOI (except for older Florida males); this is possibly due to anthropogenic factors in this area (e.g., habitat fragmentation) influencing the frequency of contacts that may occur in less disturbed habitats (Hess, 1996). Using an agent\u2010based modeling approach in another wild felid (bobcat, Lynx rufus), Tracey, Bevins, VandeWoude, and Crooks (2014) found that generally pathogen transmission within habitat patches was lower, and between\u2010patch transmission was higher, in more fragmented landscapes. They also concluded that overall disease prevalence typically was lower in more fragmented landscapes, in accordance with our findings for California. It should be noted that the effects of habitat fragmentation on transmission are complicated and dependent on interactions with animal movement behavior and epidemiology (White, Forester, & Craft, 2018).",

This is supported by all the best fit models and any other competitive models. Thus, puma in our study do not appear to suffer marked mortality effects from FIV, despite the known immunosuppressive consequences of lentiviruses in humans and some cat populations. There is both theoretical and empirical evidence that argues that endemic parasites (i.e., those that are permanently maintained) can have important effects on their host (Anderson & May, 1978; Scott, 1988; Tompkins et al., 2002). For example, studies have demonstrated that parasites, including viruses, can significantly affect wildlife mortality and shape population dynamics (Cavanagh et al., 2004; Hudson, Dobson, & Newborn, 1998; Telfer et al., 2002; Tompkins & Begon, 1999). An opposing notion is that endemic parasites may have little effect on their host because parasite fitness would suffer if parasites measurably reduce host life expectancy (Lack, 1954). Our lack of evidence for FIV\u2010induced mortality in puma supports this and fits a theory of a long history of coevolutionary association between FIV\u2010like viruses and wild feline hosts (Carpenter et al., 1996; Carpenter & O'Brien, 1995), or a lack of virulence in the FIV strain adapted to puma. Time post\u2010infection to disease effects could also be a factor governing the impacts of FIV; perhaps the normal lifespan of the puma is relatively short compared to the time taken for the disease effects to become apparent. A possibility is that disease\u2010associated mortality may be dependent on time since infection, so that the disease becomes more lethal the longer an animal is infected. A potential avenue for further research would be to test a model with a disease\u2010associated mortality term that increases with puma age.",

(2006) found a consistent but nonsignificant trend toward poorer reproductive performance in FIV\u2010infected females. In addition, it is possible that infection with FIV may mean that animals are at a higher risk of contracting other diseases, for example feline parvovirus or feline leukemia virus (FeLV; Cunningham et al., 2008). However, data collected from 207 pumas indicated no serological evidence for a higher probability of secondary infections associated with FIV (Biek et al., 2006). Indeed, some reported co\u2010infection relationships may simply reflect behavior phenotypes of hosts, such that some individuals are more likely to be exposed to multiple pathogens, rather than owing to pathogen\u2013pathogen interactions (Carver et al., 2015). An additional complication is that FIV may influence the impact of other infections rather than (or as well as) affecting exposure rates, yet the serology data is only indicative of exposure. Further examination of co\u2010infection patterns in puma would be a valuable direction for future research.",

In addition, a strong age dependency in the FOI of Mycobacterium bovis in bison in Canada has been demonstrated, as well as disease\u2010associated mortality (Heisey et al., 2006). Like in our study, the FOI was found to be higher in males than in females for both these systems (Caley & Hone, 2002; Heisey et al., 2006). In an investigation into the FOI of Mycoplasma agassizii in gopher tortoises in Florida, sites with high seroprevalence were found to have substantially higher FOI than low seroprevalence sites (Ozgul, Oli, Bolker, & Perez\u2010Heydrich, 2009).

Cross\u2010species transmission of the bobcat FIV subtype has occurred from bobcats to puma (Franklin et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2017), and of FeLV from domestic cats to puma (Brown et al., 2008). These transmission events may occur as a consequence of puma predation on bobcats and domestic cats, situations similar to that which fostered transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to humans (becoming HIV). Studying the FOI of FIV leads to an improved understanding of disease transmission in these feline species, and of lentiviral transmission in general (e.g., SIV and HIV) through potential parallels. Investigating the FOI in reservoir hosts may also help identify which age class of individuals are most likely to contribute to spillover events, and estimating the FOI in newly established host species could inform mitigation strategies, such as targeted vaccination of particular age classes.",

Our method may be particularly applicable for pathogens with a relatively high seroprevalence, and for species in which it is relatively easy to collect biological samples, such as species of conservation concern where there is routine monitoring, or species which are hunted for sport.",

Also, the frequency and nature of different transmission routes for wild animals, such as pumas, can be unclear, due to the difficulty in observing or simulating transmission. This study presents a method of assessing vital parameters for pathogen transmission and the impact of a disease on host mortality, using age\u2010prevalence data. Our approach to estimate the age\u2010specific FOI is a way of revealing the effects of age on infection risk, which can identify those subpopulations most at risk of infection, highly useful for disease management. It also offers insights into the plausibility of different transmission routes. In our study system, aggressive encounters between pumas seem to be one important mode of FIV transmission, supported by the result that males generally have a higher FOI than females. Our findings also suggest that transmission from mothers to cubs is a more common means of puma FIV transmission than previously thought.",
