            "text": "Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek (Figure S1), widely distributed in Southern China, is the only plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. Its roots are used as a traditional Chinese medicine, named \u201cNan-Ban-Lan-Gen\u201d (National Pharmacopoeia Committee, 2015), for its antibacterial, antiviral, and immunoregulatory effects in treating colds, fever, and influenza, and especially severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sun et al., 2008). Its leaves and stems are used to extract indigo naturalis (Qingdai). Previous studies have shown that Qingdai is used to treat leukemia (Li et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2014), ulcerative colitis (Suzuki et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2014), oral cancer (Lo and Chang, 2013), and psoriasis (Lin et al., 2012). Numerous active compounds have been identified from B. cusia to date, such as indole alkaloids, quinazolinone alkaloids, monoterpenes, triterpenes, flavonoids, sterols, anthraquinones, benzoxazinones, and lignans. Of these ingredients, the pharmaceutical activities of indole alkaloids are most frequently reported for their leukocyte-inhibitory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities (Li et al., 1993; Wu et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2014). Recently, indirubin, tryptanthrin, and isorhamnetin were successfully characterized, and their anti-leukemia effects were validated (Wu X. X. et al., 2016). These compounds are secondary metabolites synthesized during normal plant growth or in response to environmental stresses (Borowski et al., 2014). The stress response mechanism of B. cusia to harsh environmental conditions needs to be explored to better understand its role in producing active ingredients. At present, the genetic information of B. cusia for molecular biology research is limited in public databases, which makes further in-depth studies more difficult. The mRNA has recently been sequenced, and the partial contigs have already been deposited into the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (SRR4428209) to accelerate genetic studies in B. cusia.",

Moreover, studies show that most hormones can regulate plant physiological activities, and exogenous plant hormones can improve plant resistance to variable environments (Bari and Jones, 2009). For example, abscisic acid (ABA) is called \u201cstress hormone\u201d in plants because it plays an important role in resisting drought, salinity, and heat (Tuteja, 2007). Jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA) plays a key role in plant defense and growth (Zhang M. et al., 2015). Moreover, ultraviolet (UV)-B and MeJA were applied in combination for their synergistic effects on the expression levels of key genes in the biosynthetic pathway (Wang et al., 2016).",

The main outcome of RNA-Seq data is the identification of differentially expressed genes. It is also used to search for reference genes. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a sensitive, specific, and reproducible technique widely used to analyze the expression of genes in different organisms and tissues under different conditions (Bustin, 2002; Andersen et al., 2004; Caldana et al., 2007). Consequently, it has become the method of choice for validating candidate genes with a large sample of individuals and replicates. However, it is necessary to select suitable reference genes as internal controls under different experimental conditions for accurate RT-qPCR evaluation because of the variability in initial material, RNA integrity, RT-PCR efficiency, and RT-qPCR efficiency (Derveaux et al., 2010). Further, gene expression can be highly tissue specific and differentiated based on the physiological status of the organism or experimental treatments.",

In this regard, several free Excel-based statistical algorithms such as geNorm (Vandesompele et al., 2002), NormFinder (Andersen et al., 2004), and BestKeeper (Pfaffl, 2001) permit the identification of the best internal controls from a set of candidate normalization genes in a given series of biological samples. They have been successfully employed to identify the most stable reference genes in animals, microorganisms, human diseases, and various plant species, such as parsley (Li M. Y. et al., 2016), Chrysanthemum morifolium (Qi et al., 2016), Camellia sinensis (Wu Z. J. et al., 2016), Oxytropis ochrocephala (Wang et al., 2015), and Gentiana macrophylla (He et al., 2016). Besides these software programs, the best suitable reference gene should be evaluated with target genes associated with experimental conditions to obtain reliable results. B. cusia is still a less-studied species at the molecular level. Terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs), derivatives of shikimate and terpenoid pathways, are important medicinal ingredients in B. cusia, and they are activated in response to hormonal stresses (Schluttenhofer et al., 2014; Zhang W. et al., 2015). Shikimate kinase and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) are the main enzymes involved in the synthesis of TIAs (Veau et al., 2000; Kasai et al., 2005). Therefore, the genes coding for them are interesting target genes that may be able to testify the reliability of the reference genes under different experimental conditions.",

In ABA stress, the expression level of BcSK and BcDXR reached the highest at 6 h when using the most stable reference genes (18S) as the internal control, while the expression level was overestimated when the least stable genes were used (GAPDH). Similarly, the relative expression level of BcSK increased when normalized using the most stable genes (18S) in normal organs, while the expression level was overestimated when normalized using the least stable combination (GAPDH). The relative expression patterns of BcDXR were opposite when the foregoing two genes were used as controls. Meanwhile, UBC and TUBa, which showed the most and least stable genes, respectively, in different organs subset were used as the reference genes, and the expression levels of BcDXR and BcSK were generally identified with the expression profile in RNA-Seq (Figure 4).

The accurate expression level of a selected gene requires appropriate internal controls, which are commonly called housekeeping or reference genes (Derveaux et al., 2010). The ideal control genes should be stably expressed under each experimental condition, independent of organs, tissues, developmental stages, and different treatments (Bustin et al., 2009). However, no universally suitable control genes are available, since numerous studies have reported that the expression of reference genes can also vary considerably with experimental conditions and different species (Reid et al., 2006; Wan et al., 2011; Galli et al., 2013; Li J. et al., 2016). Therefore, a set of potential housekeeping genes must be previously validated in each particular experimental subset. To date, few studies have compared and selected housekeeping genes in B. cusia. This has hindered the characterization of genes involved in different organisms and stress responses in B. cusia. This novel study performed the first large-scale transcriptome data analysis for B. cusia (unpublished), consisting of 293,666 unigenes, which were used for reference gene selection. The RNA-Seq data were useful sources for screening candidate housekeeping genes and represented an important strategy for large-scale reference gene selection for non-model plants (Zhuang et al., 2015).",

However, another study showed that 18S and 25S rRNAs had the least stable expression at different developmental stages and in different varieties of rice (Li et al., 2010). Moreover, the selections of reference genes were not consistent in various species. ACT and TUBb in carrot (Tian et al., 2015) were the most suitable reference genes under \u201cabiotic stress\u201d and \u201chormonal stimuli,\u201d but they were not suitable choices in the present study. Moreover, GAPDH showed a good performance in \u201chormonal stimuli\u201d in parsley (Li M. Y. et al., 2016) but was the least stable in carrot. Also, GAPDH was the least stable gene in Eucalyptus spp. (Boava et al., 2010) and Petunia hybrida (Mallona et al., 2010). The results demonstrated that each species might choose its own stably expressed genes for each subset of experimental conditions. 18S rRNA is frequently used as the control gene for normalizing because it is independent of developmental stages and external stimuli (Gantasala et al., 2013). Moreover, the 26 reports (real-time RT-PCR carried out on barley; published in the period of January 1996 to March 2008) examined indicated that 18S rRNA was the most frequently used gene (8 times) among the 16 different reference genes used (Kozera and Rapacz, 2013).",

BcSK and BcDXR were found to play important roles in the indole and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways, respectively. GeNorm is used in most studies because of its capacity to determine the number of genes necessary for normalization (Kozera and Rapacz, 2013). The pairwise variation (V) was analyzed in this study to determine the optimal number of genes required for normalization; the Vn/Vn+1 values were below 0.15 under all subset conditions (Figure 3), indicating that one stable reference gene was enough to obtain accurate results. Therefore, 18S rRNA and GAPDH were used to testify the expression levels of BcSK and BcDXR under stress conditions and different plant organs. The expression levels of BcSK and BcDXR increased with induction time in the MeJA treatment subset, verifying that TIAs are also induced by MeJA in B. cusia. Moreover, the more the expression of BcSK, which participates in the shikimate pathway, the higher the production of indigo (Figure S5). However, it decreases later because of branching to other aromatic compounds. Both the target genes had a peak expression at 6 h in the ABA stimuli subset as a result of the plant resistance to stress, conforming to the phenomenon that ABA not only promoted withering of an organism but could also improve disease resistance in plants. The expression pattern of both genes was generally identified with the expression profile in RNA-Seq in different plant organs.",
