            "text": "Cerebral inflammation involving activation of resident glial cells, release of soluble mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, and infiltration of peripheral bone marrow\u2013derived myeloid cells (BMDCs) is a process that occurs throughout the course of many neurodegenerative diseases. The chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) protein (also known as macrophage chemoattractant protein 1, or MCP-1) is well-recognized for its ability to mediate macrophage recruitment and migration to sites of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke and Alzheimer disease (AD) [1-7]. Transgenic mice that overexpress CCL2 in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibit a robust accumulation of macrophages and activation of microglia in the brain [8,9], whereas mice deficient in the CCL2 gene show reduced leukocyte infiltration after autoimmune encephalomyelitis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and HIV-associated dementia [10-12]. In neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, recent evidence derived from genetically modified animal models suggests that infiltrating macrophages contribute to reduced amyloid pathology [13-18]. Other studies have indicated that CCL2 expression accelerates amyloidosis in an amyloid precursor protein (APP)/CCL2 bigenic mouse model, suggesting a different role of CCL2 in resident microglia and ultimately the AD pathology of these mice [19]. Also, CCL2 levels are reportedly increased in the brain, serum and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients [20-22], further supporting a central role for this chemokine in neuroinflammation.",

Hence, in this experiment, we used recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to overexpress and distribute CCL2 in the CNS of adult mice and to investigate the effect of CCL2 on microglial activation in vivo. Microglia, the primary immune-competent cells of the CNS, exhibit many stages of activation and varying morphology [23,24]. Resting microglia exhibit a ramified morphology and express low levels of many cell surface immune molecules. Activated microglia exhibit an amoeboid morphology [25], increased phagocytic ability and enhanced migratory capacity within the brain, along with increased expression of cell surface glycoproteins, including CD45 and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) [26]. The activation state of microglia is characterized by two main classes [27]. The \u201cclassically activated\u201d M1 microglial phenotype is characterized by strong antigen-presenting abilities, proinflammatory cytokine production and the production of toxic intermediates such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species. The \u201calternatively activated\u201d M2 microglia are involved in tissue repair and wound-healing processes, are characterized by high levels of arginase expression and are generated in response to cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 [28,29].",

Interestingly, introduction of CCL2 via rAAV9 transduction resulted in secretion of cytokines representing both spectra of microglial activation states. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated a dual effect of CCL2 on gene expression associated with microglial activation in vivo. We showed that a single chemokine can affect two very essential pathways, suggesting that CCL2 is an attractive target in neuroinflammatory diseases.",

The BMDCs ubiquitously overexpressed GFP. Twenty-four hours before tissue collection, 5 million CD11b+/GFP cells (mostly monocytes) in a volume of 100 \u03bcl were injected into recipient mice previously treated with rAAV9-CCL2 or rAAV9-GFP (cohort 1 or 2). Using both histological evaluation and flow cytometry, we confirmed the migration of these cells into the CNS of CCL2-injected mice (Figure 3). To identify the extravasation and distribution of GFP+ cells, we first performed immunohistochemical staining for GFP using sections from rAAV9-CCL2-injected animals (cohort 1). Our data showed that GFP+ BMDCs were located mainly in the parenchyma of the ipsilateral hippocampus and cortex as well as in the perivascular area (Figures 3A through 3D). Furthermore, we used unbiased stereology [44] to count CD11b+/GFP+ labeled cells in the CNS after overexpression of CCL2 (Figure 3E). More GFP+ cells were counted in the ipsilateral hippocampus compared to the ipsilateral cortex. GFP+ cells in the rAAV-GFP-injected mice could not be counted, because there was marker overlap between the rAAV-GFP and the GFP+ monocytes.",

To verify the effect of CCL2 expression on activation of microglia, immunoreactivity of brain tissue for CD45 + microglia was measured in rAAV9-CCL2 and rAAV9-GFP injected mice. Accumulation of mononuclear cells positive for CD45 in the brain 7 weeks post rAAV injection were observed in both hippocampus and cortex of CCL2 overexpressing animals (Figure 4). CD45 mononuclear cells occupied areas around the injection site and in the blood vessels lining ipsilateral hippocampus (arrow, Figure 4D, E and F). Following CCL2 overexpression, microglia were activated and acquired a ramified morphology throughout both cortex and hippocampus (Figure 4B, D, G and H). CD45+ microglia levels were significantly higher in the parenchyma of the ipsilateral hemisphere in CCL2 injected mice compared to the GFP control mice. When quantified using image analysis (percent positive area), we found that CD45 expression was significantly increased in cortex and in the hippocampus of CCL2 overexpressing mice (Figure 4I and J). Microglia from rAAV9-GFP injected mice remained negative for CD45 expression in both regions of interest (Figure 4A, C and I-J).",

CCL2 increased the accumulation of cells that were highly immunoreactive for MHCII in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampi of rAAV-CCL2-injected animals (Figures 5B and 5D through 5H). These MHCII cells presented various morphologies, including the ramified morphology typical of activated microglia (higher magnification shown in Figures 5E and 5H, arrows), although other cells had a more rounded morphology consistent with perivascular macrophages (Figures 5F and 5G, arrowheads). We observed that MHCII+ round cells accumulated near the sites of injection, such as the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, blood vessels in the hippocampus and vessels descending from the pia in the cortex (Figures 5B and 5D, arrows). We were unable to detect MHCII immunoreactivity in the brain microglia of animals transduced with rAAV9-GFP, except in the immediate vicinity of the injection site (Figures 5A and 5C).

            "text": "To this point, our data suggested that CCL2 overexpression can generate activation of microglia using markers such as CD45 and MHCII. CCL2 has been reported to be a pro-inflammatory chemokine, with its primary effect on the innate immune system via chemotaxis of monocytes. However, a few studies have reported that CCL2 affects the adaptive immune system by Th1/Th2 polarization [32,33]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of increased CCL2 levels on the CNS microglia activation stages, also referred to as M1/M2 activation. To understand the effect of CCL2 on polarization of brain microglia, we evaluated markers of microglial classical activation (Figures 6A through 6F). Both IL-1\u03b2 and calgranulin B (S100A9) are proinflammatory proteins that are associated with classical activated microglia. S100-A9 is an inflammatory marker protein expressed almost exclusively in myeloid cells [62]. We found that CCL2 induced high levels of S100-A9 expression and that S100-A9 positive cells were prominently located around the site of injection. The positive cells were exclusively of the rounded mononuclear phenotype (Figure 6B and C). These findings suggest that the S100A9-expressing cells did not transform into an activated phenotype, in spite of the CCL2 stimulus, or that the observed mononuclear phenotype represents the newly recruited cells responding to the CCL2 stimulus [63]. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed IL-1\u03b2 positive microglia, found in the parenchyma of the ipsilateral hemisphere of CCL2 injected mice. The parenchymal IL-1\u03b2 positive cells displayed predominantly a ramified/activated phenotype (Figure 6E) although rounded mononuclear cells were observed in the vicinity of blood vessel and meninges (Figure 6F). Brain tissue from control animals did not stain positively for any of the M1 markers (Figures 6A and 6D).",

The pattern of inflammatory cells was different in rAAV9-CCL2-injected mice than in rAAV-GFP-injected control mice (Figure 6). The microglia of CCL2-overexpressing mice were immunoreactive for the Arg-1 marker in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and the Arg-1+ microglia showed a range of morphologies (Figures 6H and 6I). For instance, we observed Arg-1+ microglia displaying a rod-shaped phenotype (Figure 6I), whereas Arg-1+ rounded mononuclear cells were occasionally found in the CCL2 mice (Figure 6H). YM1 represents another alternative activated microglial cell\u2013surface marker. We found that CCL2 overexpression induced YM1 expression on brain microglia, and, overall, YM1+ cells were present in the regions where overexpression of CCL2 was more abundant. YM1+ microglia displayed equal distribution between ramified and rounded morphologies in both brain regions (Figures 6K and 6L). We found that rAAV9-GFP animals did not show positive immunoreactivity for any of the alternative activation microglial markers (Figures 6G and 6J). These results suggest that microglia adopted the M2 phenotypic characteristics in response to CCL2 overexpression.",

Hippocampi from rAAV9-CCL2- and rAAV9-GFP-injected animals (cohort 2) were homogenized and processed as described above. We observed nine- and sixfold increases in the levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF (Figure 8), respectively, in the hippocampi of CCL2-treated mice (5.8 \u00b1 1.9 pg/ml vs 7.5 \u00b1 3.9 pg/ml) compared to GFP-injected mice (0.5 \u00b1 0.2 pg/ml vs 1.2 \u00b1 0.4 pg/ml). In addition, eotaxin 1 (CCL-11) levels were increased 2.5-fold in response to CCL2 overexpression (13.9 \u00b1 3.4 pg/ml vs 7.5 \u00b1 0.8 pg/ml, P < 0.05, in CCL2-injected animals vs GFP control animals, respectively). Meanwhile, CCL2 overexpression did not significantly increase the levels of the M1-related cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17, whereas levels of IL-12p70 and IFN-\u03b3 were undetectable. In addition, mean levels of M2-related cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 were slightly increased in the CCL2-injected mice but these data did not reach statistical significance (26 \u00b1 5.1 pg/ml, 12 \u00b1 3.6 pg/ml and 392 \u00b1 207 pg/ml, respectively) compared to control animals (14 \u00b1 5.6 pg/ml, 7.2 \u00b1 3.0 pg/ml and 482 \u00b1 396 pg/ml, respectively).

We used the anterior cortex region of animals from both groups of cohort 2 to identify the genes that were differentially expressed. We used the rigorous criteria of qRT-PCR described previously [65] to determine that 7 of 14 gene transcripts were significantly changed by overexpression of CCL2 (Table 1). We showed a significant increase in gene transcripts such as Arg-1, Chi3L3 (YM1) and EAR2 (2.4-, 2.7- and 3.8-fold increases, respectively). These genes and their respective proteins are widely used as markers of M2 alternatively activated macrophages and are generally responsive to the effects of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 [64]. Gene transcripts associated with M1 classically activated microglia were also induced. S100A8 and S100A9 are two small calcium-binding proteins increased during proinflammatory activity. The expression of S100A8 was increased threefold in the cortex of CCL2-overexpressing animals compared to controls. The expression of the Sirp1\u03b2 transcript, a member of transmembrane glycoproteins expressed in myeloid cells and associated with phagocytosis [66], was strongly (17-fold) increased in response to CCL2. Because CCL2 overexpression significantly increased levels of eotaxin 1 protein, we investigated the expression levels of other C-C motif ligands with chemotactic activity. We found a 1.7-fold increase in CCL24 (eotaxin 2), but not in CCL26 (eotaxin 3, Table 1), compared to control tissue. Not all the genes related to the M1 or M2 activation state of microglia were affected by CCL2 (Table 1). For example, expression of iNOS, which is involved in the M1 classical activation of microglia, was not changed. Marco expression, another M1 marker, declined slightly, whereas the expression of S100A9 RNA was unchanged, despite the increased protein observed by immunohistochemical analysis. These findings suggest that the effect of CCL2 can be specific to some of the gene transcripts, but not to all microglia-related gene transcripts.",

In addition, whether their effect is beneficial or pathological appears to be dependent on the CNS insult (for review, see [67]). Less attention has been focused on the responses of resident brain microglia to CCL2. Consequently, we used viral vectors to generate CCL2 overexpression in the adult brain. Seven weeks after intracranial injection of rAAV-CCL2, CCL2 was expressed at high levels in cortical and hippocampal neurons. Previous work has documented neuronal tropism for AAV vectors and long-term expression [35,68]. In response, two markers of microglial activation, CD45 and MHCII, were elevated around the site of injection. Both rounded and ramified morphologies were observed. CCL2 also increased expression of markers indicating both a proinflammatory M1 phenotype and an alternative M2 phenotype. Increased staining was observed for the M1 markers calgranulin B (S100A9) and IL-1\u03b2, as well as for the M2-selective markers arginase 1 and YM1. In addition, cytokine/chemokine production and gene expression data confirm that both M1 and M2 marker RNAs and proteins were induced. Together, these results indicate that CCL2 induces a unique profile of activation markers, thereby influencing the cerebral inflammatory environment. The dichotomy between M1 and M2 activation states appears blurry and may not be a useful categorization of microglial activation.",

            "text": "Microglia populate the CNS during early embryogenesis, whereas monocytes circulate in the blood, patrolling the environment. In untreated normal mice, monocytes are generally unable to enter the brain, which is anatomically separated from the periphery by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [40,69]. The roles of peripheral monocyte subsets and their extravasation vary in different disease models and different organs [70]. Identification of monocyte infiltration has been greatly improved by the development of GFP/RFP knock-in reporter mice [71-73] and the use of GFP-labeled bone marrow chimeras following X-irradiation. However, potential effects of radiation on the brain microenvironment, including microglial activation, BBB integrity and promoting myeloid cell engraftment have been raised [74]. To track the rate of monocyte infiltration in vivo, we used the transfer of GFP+ bone marrow cells positively selected for the CD11b monocytic subset. We have previously shown that this monocytic subset migrates into APP/PS1 mouse brain in the absence of X-irradiation and become localized around amyloid plaques [40]. In the present study, we have shown that CCL2 was able to promote the extravasation of blood-derived GFP monocytes into wild-type mouse CNS. Immunohistochemistry revealed GFP+ cells in the parenchyma of the ipsilateral hemisphere in the vicinity of the injection site as well as in perivascular areas. These cells were round with a diameter approximating 10 \u03bcm, consistent with the size expected for monocytes. Stereological counts showed significantly more GFP+ cells in hippocampus than in anterior cortex. No GFP+ cells were observed in the contralateral hemisphere (cohort 1) in the absence of CCL2 overexpression. We also isolated single-cell suspensions from brain homogenates from cohort 2 for flow cytometry. GFP+ cells could be identified only in CCL2-treated brains. It is likely that neurons are not captured by this isolation procedure. Nineteen percent of the recovered cells were recruited GFP+ in the brains of CCL2-treated mice. Our data are in agreement with other findings showing that CCL2 is sufficient for recruiting blood-borne cells to sites of brain injury [75]. It is likely that the CCL2 levels achieved in this model may also be reached during periods of CNS inflammation. This model may be a useful experimental system to analyze the effects of CCL2 on extravasation of blood-borne macrophages across the BBB.We used immunofluorescence to determine whether recruited GFP+ cells express markers in common with microglia. We observed colocalization of GFP with YM1, but not with MHCII. Thus, it is not possible to discriminate resident microglia from infiltrating monocytes with the microglial markers in common use at present. The extent to which infiltrating cells can enter the brain in disease states and differentiate into macrophages and/or microglia is unclear. Future experiments could examine longer time periods to determine patterns of differentiation of the monocytes entering the CNS in response to CCL2.",

            "text": "Several transgenic CCL2 mouse models have been developed in an effort to understand the chemotactic and recruitment properties mediated by brain CCL2 in vivo. CCL2 expressed under the control of the myelin basic promoter caused prominent mononuclear cell infiltration in the brain [3,76]. These cells were characterized as F4/80, Mac-1 and CD45 leukocytes and were located largely in the perivascular space. Inflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pertussis toxin) promoted parenchymal infiltration of leukocytes. Similarly, the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter was used to overexpress CCL2 in another line of mice. These mice developed age-dependent accumulation of leukocytes in the perivascular space and increased expression of CD45 [77]. Inflammatory signals or viral infection resulted in more severe disease and/or more rapid onset of symptoms [33,78,79]. Our data demonstrate that CCL2 expressed under the chicken \u03b2-actin promoter and introduced into the adult CNS via AAV9 resulted in parenchymal recruitment of GFP+ BMDCs, as well as local presence of ramified and amoeboid-activated cells expressing MHCII and CD45.",

On the basis of published work, we believe the CCL2 was overexpressed for the majority of the 7-wk treatment period. Other authors have demonstrated that a transgenic mouse that expressed CCL2 under the GFAP promoter developed pertussis-induced reversible inflammatory encephalopathy and that CCL2 directed a Th1-biased inflammatory reaction, as shown by high levels of TNF-\u03b1, INF\u03b3 and IL-2 in the CNS. In contrast, mice lacking CCL2 exhibit decreased severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with diminished Th1 cytokine secretion in the CNS [10,33,77,80]. Other research highlights the importance of CCL2 in Th2-selective activation [32,81]. In a pulmonary granuloma model, overexpression of mouse CCL2 via recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 differentially altered the outcome of the immune responses toward the Th2 phenotype and was accompanied by increased production of IL-10 and IL-13 [82]. However, we found that the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampi of CCL2 mice either were not significantly increased (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17) or were undetectable (IFN\u03b3 and IL-12p70). In addition, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 were slightly but not statistically significantly increased, suggesting a modest impact of CCL2 on the M2 activation state. Instead, CCL2 induced a pattern of cytokine induction that was unique and not completely consistent with either an M1 or an M2 pattern. We observed elevations in the levels of IL-6, GM-CSF and CCL11 (eotaxin 1) following CCL2 overexpression.",

            "text": "The phagocytic activity of microglia expressing S100A8 and Sirp\u03b2 proteins have been reported in acute and chronic inflammation [46,85]. It is still not clear whether CCL2 acts as a modulator of resident microglial phagocytosis or as a chemoattractant for peripheral macrophages to infiltrate the brain and accelerate clearance of pathological aggregates. Recent evidence derived using genetically modified animal models of amyloid deposition suggests that infiltrating macrophages reduce amyloid deposits [15-18,86,87]. Other studies have suggested a role of CCL2 in accelerating the development of oligomeric and soluble amyloid-\u03b2 levels [19,88,89]. Our data demonstrate that CCL2 not only was able to activate resident microglia but also induced gene expression linked to both the M1 and M2 activation pathways. The presence of both classes of markers could demonstrate a continuum of microglial activation. For instance, increases in mRNA levels for markers of both M1 and M2 activation in animal models of AD have been reported, suggesting heterogenicity of these cells [27,90]. Induction of \u201cclassical\u201d activation of microglia has been proven to be beneficial in the clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 pathology [91]. On the other hand, a recent report by Heneka and collaborators demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome deficiency skewed microglial activation toward a M2 signature but also resulted in decreased amyloid-\u03b2 deposits [92]. Meanwhile, activation of microglia via LPS- or CX3CR1-deficient microglia significantly induced tau pathology, possibly via IL-1/p38MAPK signaling pathway activation [93,94]. These findings underscore the need for further examination of the functional properties of M1 vs M2 microglial activation. Although we did not investigate how this inflammation correlates with the pathology related to a specific neurological disease, the role of CCL2-mediated inflammation in pathological settings needs to be clarified. Interestingly, increased CCL2 levels have been found in the brain, serum and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients [20,95]. Further, in a recent study, Westin et al. reported that the CCL2 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid are correlated with faster cognitive decline in patients with early-stage AD [96]. Changes in the levels of CCL2 and its CCR2 receptor have been found in the brain tissue of patients with trauma, prion disease, cerebral malaria, HIV dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis (see [67] for review).",

The finding that CCL2 can influence the direction of an immune response further indicates the complexity of inflammatory responses and the importance of this molecule. Our data suggest an important role of CCL2 in activating microglia and defining the CNS inflammatory milieu. It also highlights the use of gene therapy approaches to investigate the role of blood-borne myeloid precursors in CNS diseases.",
