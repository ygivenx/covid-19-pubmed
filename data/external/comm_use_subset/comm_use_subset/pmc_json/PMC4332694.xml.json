            "text": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is an important pathogen of domestic cats that is distributed worldwide. Prevalence estimates vary from 1% to 44%, depending on the geographical location as well as the entry criteria of each study (Hartmann, 1998; Ishida et al., 1989). Outdoor, adult, male, sick cats with bite wounds are at increased risk of infection, since transmission is mainly via bites from infected cats (Hartmann, 1998). Clinical signs are similar to those described for human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS) and include signs of immunosuppression, hematopoietic changes and neoplasia (Hartmann, 2011). The progression of experimental FIV infection can be monitored using the staging system used in HIV infection: acute, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, asymptomatic carrier phase (AC), AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS (English et al., 1994). While this classification is useful in well-controlled, experimental settings, it has limitations under field conditions, mainly because of strain-related variability in pathogenicity, variation in the ages of cats at the time of infection as well as possible exposure to secondary pathogens (Hartmann, 2012; Pedersen et al., 2001; Podell et al., 1997). Hence, there have been variable morbidity and mortality rates reported in naturally infected cats (Addie et al., 2000; Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1997; Kohmoto et al., 1998; Liem et al., 2013).",

Surrogate markers for HIV infection are well established and valuable in monitoring both responses to therapy and the likelihood of disease progression (Churchill, 1997; Katzenstein, 2003; Okonji et al., 2012; Shaunak and Teo, 2003; Smith and Stein, 2002). In contrast, to our knowledge, prospective controlled studies investigating the course of FIV infection and markers of disease progression have not been described. Consequently, the longitudinal course of naturally acquired FIV infection is poorly described and the variability in rates of progression to immunodeficiency are poorly understood.",

The relationship between FIV infection and clinical disease is unclear, with some studies reporting that infected cats are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality (Muirden, 2002), while others report no such association (Akhtardanesh et al., 2010; Liem et al., 2013). Considering all 44 FIV-positive cats, there was no relationship between mortality and morbidity and FIV infection; however, this was not the case when the two cohorts were examined separately. Our observations in Group 2 indicated that living conditions might have played a role in the more rapid disease onset. In contrast, cats from Group 1 were generally housed in single cat households and remained alive and in relatively good health over the study period. Therefore, it appears that FIV infection is more likely to progress in cats kept in crowded shelter conditions compared to those living in spacious environments. As a corollary, our results suggest that the FIV-positive cats in our study that lived in single or dual cat households remained free of clinical signs of illness over the study period; this can most likely be attributed to lower risks of exposure to opportunistic pathogens and reduced levels of environmental stress.",

            "text": "FIV infected cats are at greater risk of opportunistic infections and neoplasia (Hartmann, 2012). Regular assessment of their health status is essential and, according to European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases guidelines (Hosie et al., 2009), health checks are recommended every 6 months. The short time to disease progression leading to the deaths of 63% of cats in Group 2 within the 22-month follow-up period was unexpectedly high, especially in light of previously published studies that were unable to demonstrate a difference in lifespan between FIV-positive and FIV-negative cats (Addie et al., 2000; Ravi et al., 2010). The health status of cats from Group 1 was similar to that of cats in a household in which FIV infection did not reduce life expectancy over a period of 2 years (Addie et al., 2000). There are several clinical abnormalities associated with FIV infection, with gingivostomatitis being the most common. Although one study (Quimby et al., 2008) did not observe an association between FIV infection and gingivostomatitis, the high prevalence observed here was in agreement with previous reports (Bandecchi et al., 1992; Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1995; Hosie et al., 2009; Knotek et al., 1999). As gingivostomatitis is rare in SPF cats experimentally infected with FIV, co-infections with other infectious agents, such as feline calicivirus, might have contributed to this syndrome in naturally infected cats (Reubel et al., 1994; Tenorio et al., 1991). It is perhaps relevant that severe acute on chronic upper respiratory tract disease was diagnosed in four cats from Group 2 at post-mortem. Other abnormalities previously attributed to FIV-induced dysregulation and impairment of immune surveillance include dermatitis, ocular disease, renal insufficiency, lower urinary tract infections and other opportunistic infections (Barlough et al., 1991; Reche et al., 2010). Although neurological abnormalities have been reported in natural and experimental, acute and chronic FIV infections (Abramo et al., 1995; Dow et al., 1990; Podell et al., 1997, 1999), neither behavioural nor motor abnormalities were observed in our study population.",

Although FIV infection is generally associated with immunosuppression, immune hyperstimulation is evident during the early stages of infection, including B cell activation, manifested as polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (Hopper et al., 1989; Takano et al., 2012), expansion of CD8+ T cells with an activated phenotype and subsequent CD8+ T lymphocytosis (Beatty et al., 1996; Willett et al., 1993).

FIV strain variability was examined, since the Memphis FIV strains (Group 2) might have had greater oncogenic potential than the strains infecting the Chicago cohort (Group 1). However, a comparison of full-length env gene and long terminal repeat sequences revealed no significant differences (unpublished observation). It is possible that the local cluster of lymphoma in Group 2 was associated with another infectious agent, such as FeLV, but this seemed unlikely since FIV/FeLV Snap test (IDEXX) results were negative for FeLV antigen. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of regressive FeLV infection (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 2001), since PCR testing to detect integrated proviral DNA in bone marrow was not performed. Breed was unlikely to play a role, as the cats from Group 2 diagnosed with lymphoma and those from Group 1 were all classified as domestic shorthairs and came from a variety of sources within their geographic area. The shelter environment in which the cats from Group 2 lived was likely to play a role in the development of the various clinical manifestations of FIV, although exposure to potential carcinogens cannot be ruled out.",

Here we provide further evidence that FIV-positive cats had significantly lower CD4:CD8 ratios than those for FIV-negative cats over the 22-month study period in each of the cohorts (Fig. 3). We also observed a statistically significant decline in the CD4:CD8 ratio between the time of enrolment and the terminal sampling in those cats that died over the study period (Fig. 5). However, there was not a significant difference in median CD4:CD8 ratio at enrolment when cats classified as either healthy or not healthy were compared (Fig. 4). Both groups of cats had relatively low CD4:CD8 ratios with median values less than 1, regardless of their health status. Indeed, the cat that had the lowest CD4+ T lymphocyte count (0.09 K/\u03bcL) and the lowest CD4:CD8 ratio (0.08) at enrolment was classified as healthy and is still alive. Similar observations have been reported previously in FIV (Novotney et al., 1990) and HIV infections (Levy, 1988), where seropositive individuals remained asymptomatic despite significant loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes. The variability in CD4:CD8 ratios among healthy and not healthy cats in this study population also limited their utility in the prediction of disease progression.",

A study focusing on disease progression in SPF cats experimentally infected with two strains of FIV of different virulence reported a correlation between disease progression and increased plasma viral load (Diehl and Hoover, 1995). Similarly, the relationship between plasma viral load, disease progression and survival time was found in a study of naturally infected cats in Japan (Goto et al., 2002). In the present study, the median FIV load at the time of enrolment from Group 2 was 67-fold higher than that from Group 1 (P < 0.0001) and there was a marked difference in health status and mortality rate between groups over the following 22 months. It is not possible to discern whether an increased viral load was a cause or a consequence of poor health status, since that would have required knowledge of viral load kinetics and changes in health status from the time of initial infection in the FIV-infected \u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018not healthy\u2019 cats; in this prospective study the data were collected from the time of enrolment. However, statistically significant differences in FIV load between cats from Group 2 classified as \u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018not healthy\u2019 and cats that remained alive or died during the study were not apparent.

However, this hypothesis was not supported by the phylogenetic analyses performed, as cats from both groups were infected with comparable numbers of clade B and recombinant A/B viruses. Furthermore, sequences isolated from serial 6-monthly blood collections demonstrated that highly monophyletic groups were formed in 96% of the cats from Group 2, suggesting that viral isolates were not transmitted between cats despite unrestricted cohabitation (B\u0119czkowski et al., 2014).

Additionally, for the purposes of this study of naturally infected cats either adopted from shelters or rescued, it was necessary to estimate the ages of the cats and to use the date that the cat first tested FIV-positive since the precise dates of infection were not known. It has been reported previously that age at time of first exposure to FIV can influence the course of infection (George et al., 1993) and can determine the outcome of disease (Akhtardanesh et al., 2010). From a biological and behavioural perspective, the age of approximately 1\u20132 years old at the time of first diagnosis reported in this study is consistent with young cats engaging in territorial fights, especially if they are entire. The cats in our study were originally adopted from shelters and many were entire and had outdoor access at the time of shelter intake, both known lifestyle risk factors for FIV (Levy et al., 2006). In our study population, infection was more common in male cats, confirming the results of previous studies (Grindem et al., 1989; Hosie et al., 1989; Ishida et al., 1989; Levy et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al., 1989). Additionally, FIV status and multi-cat housing status could have affected the health of the cats in our study; it was not possible to discern whether they acted independently or as cofactors. FIV-negative cats matched to enrolled FIV-positive cats on housing status, as well as age and sex, were not available during the study enrolment period. While an extra layer of matching based on housing status would have been ideal, it was not achievable in this real-world study.",

It is apparent that the conclusions of this study would have been very different indeed had efforts been focused on only one of the cohorts presented herein.",
