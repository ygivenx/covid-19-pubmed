            "text": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the rarely existing traditional medicines that hold systematic theories as well as preventative and therapeutic methods for diseases in practice [1]. Since the 1950s, research methods in modern medicine (Western medicine) have been gradually introduced to TCM studies; the first TCM systematic review appeared in medical journals in the late 1990s, and now hundreds to thousands of reviews have been published on the area of TCM [2, 3]; systematic reviews have become the standard approach in assessing and summarizing primary studies. However, even though systematic reviews proved to be useful, serious consideration must be given to how they were conducted; high methodological quality of systematic reviews is a prerequisite for recommendation of the use or avoidance of a TCM intervention. At present, either researches or methods for assessing quality of systematic reviews are still not fully developed in TCM and there is substantial room for improvement [2, 3]; even in Western medicine current instruments for assessing methodological quality of systematic reviews are still suboptimal and need revision and updating [4, 5]. A new tool termed AMSTAR, an acronym for \u201ca measurement tool to assess systematic reviews,\u201d was developed strictly upon the OQAQ (Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire) [6], the Sack checklist (quality assessment checklist) [7], and three additional items. This tool is an 11-item questionnaire requiring assessors to answer \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d \u201ccannot answer,\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d; and a recent study reported that AMSTAR has good agreement, reliability, construct validity, and feasibility to assess the quality of systematic reviews [8]. However, these psychometric properties within AMSTAR were tested by having it apply to only a limited set of systematic reviews from Western medicine; a further step is needed to assess its validity and reliability, by a broader range of assessors and more samples of reviews in diverse circumstances [8]. Will the results be reproducible when assessing methodological quality of systematic reviews on traditional chinese medicine (TCM)? The answer is not clear yet, further validation is necessary. The aim of this study is to validate the reliability and external validity of AMSTAR by applying it to a sample of TCM systematic reviews.",

Two reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of identified studies independently, disagreement was resolved by discussion. A total of 165 systematic reviews on TCM were included, full detail of evaluations has been reported separately [10]. We used a computer-generated random sample (approximately 25% of the 165 systematic reviews) as a test set for validation.",

Each translator prepared a separate translation and the difficulty in obtaining conceptually equivalent expressions in Chinese was assessed too; subsequently, a sample of 2 systematic reviews on TCM was taken to perform pilot test by two authors independently; based on the results and consensus from reviewers, the final Chinese versions of AMSTAR and OQAQ were then developed for formally evaluating methodological quality of Chinese systematic reviews; all inconsistencies identified either in translation or in application were resolved by discussion. On the basis of this, we constructed a data extraction form in Chinese for this study, in which 11 items of AMSATR and 10 items of OQAQ were adopted directly. In addition, publication status and reporting characteristics of systematic reviews, such as publish language, number of pages, funding source, update or not, Cochrane systematic review or not, target disease, and institution of first author, were also incorporated; besides, the time required to complete an assessment while applying AMSTAR and OQAQ was recorded too.",

Kappa coefficient is a popular measure for chance-corrected nominal scale agreement between two raters. We adopted the Kappa values of <0 rates as less than chance agreement, 0.01\u20130.20 as slight agreement, 0.21\u20130.40 as fair agreement, 0.41\u20130.60 as moderate agreement, 0.61\u20130.80 as substantial agreement, and 0.81\u20130.99 as almost perfect agreement [8].",

Construct validity was showed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); for the purpose of calculating ICC, we adopted methods used by the AMSTAR group [8], and converted the mean total scores (mean of two assessors) of per review to the percentage of maximum score (11 points in AMSTAR and 9 points in OQAQ accordingly); in addition, we developed a 100-point rating scale for overall quality assessment based on answers to the eleven questions in AMSTAR, in which two assessors indicated his or her judgments by checking tick-marks on a horizontal line (0 to 100 point), an SR without any flaws would be scored 100 points. Meanwhile, we also adopted the item 10 in OQAQ as a validated global assessment instrument. The overall mean scores (mean of two assessors), either using the self-developed 100-point rating scale or using the item 10 from OQAQ, were also taken to verify the construct validity of AMSTAR. The feasibility of AMSTAR was assessed by recording the time it took to complete scoring, and paired t-test or nonparametric test was applied when comparing with OQAQ.",

As the methodological quality and the reporting quality were not mutually exclusive addressing in AMSTAR [8], we explored whether the number of pages had a positive or negative effect on the AMSTAR score, the result showed there was a statistical association between AMSTAR score and the number of pages (Spearman's rho = 0.67, P < 0.001).",

The analysis revealed that the construct validity was excellent, that is, the AMSTAR is a reliable and valid tool. Given the extremely strict implementation of Cochrane systematic review, such reviews conducted with high methodological quality have been widely recognized [52]; the AMSTAR revealed Cochrane systematic reviews have higher quality scores than non-Cochrane systematic reviews, that is, the AMSTAR has an ability to discriminate methodological quality, so it is sensitive when applying it to a sample of systematic reviews in diverse quality. The relationship between AMSTAR quality score and the number of pages can be explained by the fact that Cochrane reviews always have considerable amount of pages, these extreme outliers determined the direction and strength of the association.",

The statistical analysis revealed that the AMSTAR was slightly more time consuming in contrast to OQAQ; there may be several explanations for this. First, the AMSTAR has 11 items, longer than the 10 items in OQAQ; second, the AMSTAR was developed based on two instruments, including OQAQ itself, so items in the instruments may be overlapped, and it would take less time to complete scoring when filling replicated items; third, the sequence of applying tools may be another explanation, as we conducted the assessment in the order of first AMSTAR and then OQAQ, assessors need more time to look through a systematic review to facilitate it in the first round of assessment by using AMSTAR, while in the second round by applying OQAQ, such time would be saved.",

The current Chinese version should be translated back into English by a third party, and the back translations would be compared with the original tools to ensure the conceptual equivalence.
