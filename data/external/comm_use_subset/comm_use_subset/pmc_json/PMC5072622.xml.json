DENV and its Aedes sp. mosquito vectors are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions and is the most prevalent arthropod borne viral pathogen worldwide. Approximately half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of being infected, resulting in up to 390 million reported cases of infection yearly. Roughly 1 million infections develop into severe disease of which nearly 2\u20135% is fatal [1,2]. More than 125 countries are endemic to DENV, but geographical expansion is expected to increase due to climate change, globalization of travel and trade and viral evolution [3\u20136]. Additionally, dengue is a complex disease resulting in a wide variety of clinical symptoms. The majority of infections are very mild or clinically in apparent. Infections are often misdiagnosed due to similarities between other prevalent tropical diseases. When symptoms are present, most patients undergo a sudden onset of fever that remains for 2\u20137 days, accompanied by arthralgia, myalgia and skin rash [7].",

            "text": "The dengue virus complex consists of 4 distinct serotypes designated DENV1-4. Primary infections induce long-term protective immunity to the serotype of infection only. Individuals are susceptible to secondary infections with a new serotype. Secondary heterotypic infections are associated with the more severe and potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome [8]. As protective immunity to just one serotype may increase risk of disease upon exposure to other serotypes, leading dengue vaccines are based on tetravalent formulations to induce simultaneous immunity to all 4 serotypes. Several vaccine platforms are currently in preclinical or clinical development. These include live attenuated virus vaccines, live chimeric vaccines, inactivated virus formulations, recombinant virus vaccines, DNA and subunit vaccines [9]. Live virus formulations have progressed into clinical trials. The leading candidate, which has been tested in two large efficacy studies, demonstrated partial efficacy that varies between serotypes and based on the prior dengue exposure history of individuals [10]. Moreover, in some populations, the vaccine appeared to transiently increase risk of disease when people were exposed to a natural infection [10]. Recent advances in molecular biology have shown the safety and potential of rationally designed vaccine candidates, moving away from the whole virus paradigm and directing vaccinology towards subunit vaccine formulations. Subunit approaches for dengue generally involve the exploitation of E-protein as the major immunogen [11\u201314]. Even though several protein-based subunit vaccine approaches appear immunogenic and effective in small animals models, they have generally not been as immunogenic in primates [15].",

In general, subunit antigens as vaccine candidates are poorly effective as vaccine candidates due to size, degradation, non-specific targeting, the lack of cross-presentation and poor uptake by APCs. Coating soluble antigens to carriers is an effective strategy to increase the immunogenicity of weak immunogens. In the past decades, controlled release of prophylactic antigens has been achieved using nanoparticle vehicles or carriers composed of biodegradable polymers. One of the most promising aspects of coating subunit peptides to nanoparticle carriers is the potential to mimic structural and immunogenic features of the target pathogen. In addition to the generation of an antigen depot, the enhanced adjuvanticity of nanoparticles also contributes to enhanced vaccine efficacy by particulate antigen presentation and efficient targeting of APCs [16\u201319].",

Particle size could have implications on APC uptake, biodistribution and bio-availability. Smaller particles are phagocytosed slower than larger particles, which contributes to better distribution by rapid dissolution [20]. Therefore, the optimization of nanoparticle composition, size and shape depends on disease target and application characteristics. One of the most commonly used polymeric nanoparticles are poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles, a biodegradable polymer that can be tailored to vary degradability and release. A wide range of PLGA-based drug delivery systems have been used for the treatment and diagnosis of many diseases and disorders [21\u201323]. Many different fabrication processes have been utilized to produce PLGA based nanocarriers, out of which the PRINT (Particle Replication In Non-wetting Templates) process stands out in its capacity to control particle parameters [21,24\u201328]. The PRINT process creates monodispersed particles of uniform shape and size, is a scalable process and can be used to encapsulate or to be decorated with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic biological cargo [29\u201332].",

Analysis of the final product by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining and Western blot (WB) detection with mouse Mab 4G2 showed high yields of purified recombinant protein (Fig 1B). sRecE had a slightly lower molecular weight (expected size of ~45kDa) then the full length wildtype E-protein control containing the membrane proximal and integral regions of the protein.

After the indicated time points post footpad inoculation, the draining popliteal lymphnodes (PLNs) were isolated and analyzed for the presence of antigen (Fig 6A). Similar rapid initial drainage of antigen was observed for both sRecE and particle-adsorbed RecE at 1 hr post injections. However, the PLNs of mice inoculated with the sRecE mono-subunit was clearly detectable at 6 hr, yet undetectable at 24 hr post inoculation. The adsorption of sRecE to PLGA particles, regardless of size or shape, clearly increases bio-availability in the PLNs, since the antigen was still detected at 72hr post inoculation. Analysis of the inoculation site showed corresponding antigen presence, relative between the different groups (Fig 6B). Particulate sRecE was detected longer in the footpad compared to its soluble counterpart.",

Several groups are performing clinical trials with TV-live attenuated dengue vaccines. The leading candidate had lower efficacy against serotype 2 and also overall poor efficacy in young children [10], highlighting the importance of exploring new vaccine platforms. The use of nanotechnology in vaccine development has taken a rise in recent decades. Instead of using whole or live virus formulations to induce immunological protection against infectious diseases, subunit or subviral particle based platforms provide elegant and safe alternatives that have been proven efficacious against a large variety of viral pathogens [42\u201347].",

We will also analyze the breadth of the response by testing if different genotypes of DENV2 are neutralized by the vaccine.

In vitro, both sRecE and PLGA adsorbed RecE were readily taken up by BMDCs (S2 Fig), indicating that uptake into these antigen presenting cells was unlikely to be responsible for the enhanced immunogenicity of the PLGA vaccine. PLGA adsorbed sRecE was detected at the site of vaccination and in the draining lymph nodes for much longer than sRecE alone indicating that extended bio-availability was most likely responsible for the enhanced antibody responses in PLGA vaccinated animals. We propose that PLGA vaccination leads to the formation of an antigen depot at the inoculation site and gradual release of antigen, whereas the soluble antigen alone is efficiently cleared after vaccination.",

We clearly show the added effect of particulation on raised immune responses and antigen trafficking.
