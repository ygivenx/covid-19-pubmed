            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family. It is a significant human pathogen which causes a wide spectrum of clinical illnesses ranging from a silent or mild febrile infection, self-limited dengue fever (DF) to the severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There are four dengue virus genotypes, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 which are transmitted to humans mainly by two species of mosquitoes, Aedes agypti and Aedes Albopictus [1]. All four DENV can cause dengue. To date there are no effective vaccine or antiviral treatment for dengue. Dengue patients are usually supportively-treated until they recover without any specific treatment measures. Several studies have shown that the level of viremia correlates with the severity of disease with high viremia often seen in severe dengue. Hence, antivirals that can reduce the level of viremia or the viremic phase could possibly reduce the severity of dengue.",

There have been numerous reports on the antiviral activity of various phytochemicals against dengue viruses and these include various flavonoids [5-8]. Flavonoids are basically low molecular weight phenolic compounds found widely in different kinds of plants. Different types of flavonoids can be found in fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, bark, steams and flowers of plants. These include quercetin which can be found in some foods and fruits such as green and black tea, apple, onion, citrus, tomato and some other plants [9,10]. Antiviral activities of various other flavonoids have also been reported against some viruses including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), HSV-1, HSV-2 and some types of human adenoviruses [11-13].",

Hesperetin is a flavonone and its glycoside form, hesperidin is water soluble and it could be found in various citrus fruits. After ingestion of hesperidin, its sugar moiety is released from the backbone of this compound and the aglycone form known as hesperetin can be released. In vitro antiviral activities of hesperetin have been reported against some RNA viruses [14-16]. Naringin on the other hand, is a flavonone glycoside found abundantly in grapefruit juice. Antiviral activity of naringin were reported against HSV-1 and HSV-2 but this finding remains controversial [12,17]. Daidzein is an isoflavone found in soybeans and its antiviral activity against influenza viruses has been reported [18]. Currently, there is no published data on the possible anti-dengue virus activities of quercetin, hesperetin, naringin and daidzein. Therefore, in this study we evaluated these compounds activities on DENV-2 (NGC strain) replication in cell culture system. The effects of each compound were evaluated against different stages of dengue virus replication including virus adsorption, intracellular replication and direct virucidal activities.",

Similarly, other synthetic flavonoid derivatives also showed antiviral activity in HepG2 cells [23]. Whereas, pinostrobin was reported to inhibit DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease an enzyme important in dengue virus replication in an in vitro study [24]. These suggest that flavonoids as a group could consist of select compounds that possesses inhibitory activities against DENV. To investigate which of the many flavonoids could affect DENV infection, in the present study, we examined the potential effects of quercetin, naringin, hesperetin and daidzein on dengue virus infection of Vero cells. Unlike the previous studies which evaluated antiviral activity of flavonoids only after adsorption of virus to the cells [22,23], the present study evaluated antiviral activity by different treatment procedures tailored to determine prophylactic, post adsorption, continuous treatment and direct virucidal activities of quercetin, naringin, daidzein and hesperetin.",

The noted differences between SI values for quercetin could be due to the intracellular accumulation of quercetin during continuous treatment. A weak effect for prophylactic activity of quercetin however, was also observed. These findings suggest that the main anti-dengue activity of quercetin is likely due to its activity against the different stages of intracellular replication of DENV-2 instead of early stages of its replication cycle such as virus attachment or entry. Although, no direct virucidal activity or anti-attachment activity of quercetin was observed in the present study, antiviral activity of quercetin against human cytomegalovirus was reported with IC50 = 3.2 \u03bcM [13].

In the present study, the only anti-dengue activity of this flavonoid was demonstrated against adsorption and attachment of virus to the Vero cells and based on its antiviral activity (IC50 = 168.2 \u03bcg mL-1) and its related selectivity index (SI = 1.3), it may not be a good candidate for further development as anti-dengue drug. Similarly, daidzein activity against DENV-2 was not significant compared to quercetin (SI = 1.03). Continuous treatment of the infected Vero cells from 5 h before virus infection up to 4 days post infection did not improve its anti-dengue activity significantly. This compound therefore, could not be a suitable candidate for further development as anti-dengue drug. Hesperetin, the other flavonoid evaluated in our study, did not show no anti-dengue activity in any stages of virus infection and replication processes and this is despite the previously reported antiviral activity of hesperetin against sindbis virus [14]. Therefore, hesperetin is also not recommended for further investigations for anti-dengue drug development. In all our experiments, we showed that 0.5% of DMSO, the highest concentration of solvent used in the bioflavonoid treatment did not exhibit any antiviral activity against DENV-2 and this eliminated any probable antiviral activity from DMSO.",

Further studies will be needed to demonstrate the antiviral activities of these compounds against different genotypes of dengue virus and in appropriate animal model. There is also a need to address the issue of the low bioavailability of quercetin especially for therapeutic use [29-31]. Several strategies to increase the bioavailability of quercetin that include using lipids and emulsifiers, co-crystalization of quercetin or using ester-based precursors have been investigated [32-34]. The other topic of research would be combination drug study. At its current calculated IC50 values, the antiviral efficacy of quercetin can be further improved possibly by combining it with other potential anti-dengue compounds. This is exemplified in a study that reported the synergistic effect of \u03b1- glucoside in combination with a standard antiviral drug, ribavirin is effective against dengue infection [35].",
