Though there are several human CoV responsible for a mild respiratory disease1, most notable are the highly pathogenic human CoVs: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV capable of causing a severe respiratory disease. The zoonotic SARS-CoV emerged into human populations in 2002, spreading to 26 countries during its brief 9-month circulation in humans2. This epidemic resulted in >8000 infections with a ~10% case fatality rate and was eventually contained through public health measures, as there are no specific treatments approved for human CoV infections. With the exception of a smaller second SARS-CoV outbreak in 20043, SARS-CoV has been absent from human circulation since the initial outbreak ended. Despite the lack of recent human infections, SARS-CoV-like viruses continue to circulate in bat reservoirs4. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic human CoVs remain an emerging threat to global health security and are likely to continue to occur.",

The multi-subunit CoV RNA synthesis machinery is a complex of non-structural proteins (nsp) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1ab viral polyproteins5. The nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase possesses some minimal activity on its own6, but the addition of the nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors greatly stimulates polymerase activity7. Though additional viral nsp subunits are likely necessary to carry out the full repertoire of replication and transcription activities, the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex so far represents the minimal complex required for nucleotide polymerization. In addition, many other CoV nsps possess enzyme activities related to RNA modification8,9.",

All eight of these metal-coordinating a.a. are highly conserved across the CoV family (Supplementary Fig. 3). Both of these metal-binding sites are distal to known active sites as well as protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013RNA interactions.

The presence of structural zinc ions in nsp12 is reminiscent of bound zinc atoms in coronavirus nsp3, nsp10, nsp13, and nsp1410,13,18,19 and points to an extensive utilization of zinc ions for folding proteins of the viral replication complex.",

Sequence analysis of polymerase subunits across the Nidovirales order, which includes CoVs, revealed three conserved sequence motifs within this region: AN (SARS-CoV a.a. 69\u201389), BN (a.a. 112\u2013130), and CN (a.a. 202\u2013222)9 (Supplementary Fig. 3).

The N-terminal region of nsp8 (1\u201381) adopts a more extended or disordered conformation. In the crystal packing of the nsp7-nsp8 structure, the authors hypothesized the formation of a hetero-hexadecamer protein complex. However, for feline CoV, the co-crystal structure of nsp7 and nsp8 displayed a 2:1 stoichiometry and lacked the higher-order oligomer formation hypothesized in the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8 structure29. nsp8 has also been suggested to possess an activity polymerizing short RNA oligonucleotides proposed to be used as primers during RNA synthesis15. Mutagenesis has suggested that this primase activity lies in the N-terminal region of nsp8 and requires the formation of large oligomeric complexes to bring the active site residues into proximity15,16.

This second subunit of nsp8 interacts with the nsp12 interface domain proximal to the fingers domain and the RNA template-binding channel.

            "text": "SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 have been extensively mutated and tested in in vitro polymerase activity assays7. Of the three nsp7 mutants previously found to diminish polymerase activity, the lysine of K7A hydrogen bonds to the carbonyls of the nsp7 25\u201342 helix that interacts with nsp12 and H36A and N37A mutations lie in the nsp7\u2013nsp12 interface. Of the nsp8 residues previously mutated7 and visible in the structure, four mutants were detrimental to polymerase function. Mutation of nsp8 P183A results in the mutation of a cis-proline residue and may result in an nsp8 folding defect. The three remaining mutated nsp8 residues make important contributions to interactions with nsp12 through the second nsp8 subunit, while these same nsp8 a.a. positions are distal to the observed interaction sites in the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer. nsp8 D99A would disrupt an electrostatic interaction with nsp12 K332. P116 sits in a turn between two nsp8 helices and mutation to an alanine at this position may disrupt the ability of this loop to adopt the unique nsp12-bound conformation. Mutation of nsp8 R190A would disrupt the hydrogen bonding of R190 with carbonyls of nsp8 helix a.a. 116\u2013121, which may destabilize the unique conformation of this nsp8 region and prevent nsp12 binding. These previous mutagenesis studies validate the protein interfaces presented here and emphasize the importance of the observed interactions of nsp12 with nsp7 and nsp8.",

Further 3D sorting and refinement of these particles yielded a reconstruction at 3.5-\u00c5 resolution, which largely resembles the larger complex (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, in addition to missing the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer, this structure also displays a significant amount of disorder in the fingers domain index and ring loops, which play a role in template and NTP binding (Fig. 5). We hypothesize that the binding of the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer to the index finger loop stabilizes the polymerase domain to permit template recognition. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that, while nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 all individually recognize RNA with no or poor affinity, the complex of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 is significantly more capable of binding RNA7.",

The NiRAN domain of nsp12 presents a conserved face for interaction with the N-terminal disordered domain. Structural homology of nsp12 to the polymerases of the picornavirus family suggests residues involved in template recognition and catalysis. The role of nsp7 and nsp8 heterodimers appears to be the stabilization of nsp12 regions involved in RNA binding while a second subunit of nsp8 also plays a crucial role in polymerase activity possibly by extending the template RNA-binding surface.",

Structurally, the SARS-CoV nsp12 most closely resembles the polymerases of picornaviruses, such as poliovirus, norovirus, and rhinovirus24,25. Picornaviruses use a protein primer called VPg to prime RNA synthesis and serve as a 5\u2032 cap. However, CoVs cap their RNAs with a 5\u2032 GTP resembling host RNAs33 and hence are likely to use a distinct mechanism for RNA initiation. Biochemical evidence has shown that the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex possesses de novo initiation activity that is dependent on the nsp12 polymerase-active site7 similar to NS5 and NS5B polymerases of the Flaviviridae family such as dengue virus and hepatitis C virus, which use protein elements within the thumb domain to position a priming nucleotide in the \u22121 primer position34. However, the SARS-CoV nsp12 double-stranded RNA exit tunnel has no obstructions to act as a platform for priming nucleotides. Hence, the mechanism by which CoV polymerases carry out de novo RNA initiation is likely to be distinct from either the picornaviruses or flaviviruses, but the nature of this mechanism remains unclear.",

The homologous region spans the C-terminal large kinase domain, with the closest structural homology residing in the kinase nucleotide-binding site. Though kinase activity has not been demonstrated for nsp12, there are several shared kinase catalytic residues visible in the SARS-CoV nsp12 NiRAN structure including Asn209 and the nidovirus-conserved Asp218 and Phe219. As the nsp12 N-terminus is disordered, we are unable to determine whether this region of nsp12 resembles the small kinase domain. However, the shared residue identities with the large kinase domain do suggest a potential nucleotide-binding site within the nsp12 NiRAN domain. How such a kinase-like domain carries out the previously reported nucleotidyltransfer9 remains a subject for further study. One possibility is a mechanism similar to that of the pseudokinase SelO, which binds ATP in an alternate configuration and possesses AMPylation activity36,37.",
