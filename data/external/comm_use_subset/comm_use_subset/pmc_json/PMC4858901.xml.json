RVA infect both animals [18] and humans [5], and cause an acute gastroenteritis (AGE) accompanied by abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

Dimers of VP4 form spikes that extend from the virus surface and have essential functions in the virus life-cycle, including receptor binding and cell penetration [9].",

These tests while faster, highly sensitive and specific present some limits. They require subsequent virus isolation for the evaluation of agent infectivity. Indeed, virus isolation remains the gold standard test to recover the viral particles from clinical fecal samples, to determine their behavior in tissue culture and to measure their infectivity. In addition, isolation remains the basic assay to provide antigens that can be used as successful immunogenics to raise prominent antibodies which can be useful for the construction and development of a wide variety of immunoassays (rapid immunochromatographic strip test, microneutralization assays (SNT), ELISA, IF or qRT-PCR standards). Thus, the direct cultivation method would be necessary when large numbers of samples need to be analyzed during epidemiological surveys, vaccine trials or when further sensitivity is required. Moreover, efficient and accurate isolation of RVA is of primary importance for pathogenesis, vaccine development and academic research.",

We realized that hemagglutination (HA) of chicken erythrocytes by RVA particles decreased three to eight folds when a sample is freeze\u2013thawed at room temperature and the loss of HA was irreversible after three rounds of freeze\u2013thaw (data not shown). This observation, although reported not to alter the virus morphology [3, 4], is consistent with earlier biological studies suggesting that effective HA of a RVA strain may increase its infectivity and therefore, RVA isolation [15]. Indeed, HA phenotype of RVA is mediated by the VP4 gene which was clearly shown to code for protease enhanced plaque formation in MA104 cells [15]. This VP4 gene, was also shown to be protease-sensitive. It is cleaved to VP5 (60 kDa) and VP8* (28 kDa) in the presence of trypsin, resulting in the conversion of noninfectious rotavirus to an infectious form [7, 8].",

The results demonstrate that at lower concentration (i.e., 3\u201310 \u03bcg of trypsin), no changes at the cellular level were observed (Fig. 1a) after six passages and samples were considered negative for RVA isolation. On the contrary, cells activated as well as controls degenerated and trypsin cytotoxicity was enhanced with 25\u201330 \u03bcg of trypsin (Fig. 1b, c). In parallel, when samples were assayed with 15\u201320 \u03bcg of trypsin for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C (or 2 h at room temperature) (data not shown), appreciable changes in cell\u2019s morphology were detected 2\u20133 days post infection (pif) (Fig. 1d). RVA isolation was achieved for nine clinical samples following one or two passages (60 %). CPE was observed during the first passage for samples 3/25, 3/34, 1/10, 2/20, 2/12, 8045 and 9864. The first sign of CPE detected consisted of increased cell granularity, obscure cell boundaries, cell rounding, and eventual degeneration and detachment of cells. This phenomenon was more pronounced when samples were activated with 20 \u03bcg of TPCK. CPE were consistently observed thereafter and the cells became completely destroyed after 4 days pif (Fig. 1e, f). For two samples (3/T and 7/T), the CPE effect was observed in the second passage on day 2 pif. Therefore, we consider that 15 \u03bcg/inoculum of TPCK was the optimal concentration for bovine RVA isolation (Fig. 1g, h).",

Data from qRT-PCR confirmed that 3/T, 7/T, 3/25, 3/34, 1/10, 2/20, 2/12, 8045 and 9864 isolates were of group A rotavirus with Ct values ranging between 12.17 and 24.69. However, no RNA loads (No Ct in Table 1) were detected for 1/13, 1/18, 2/15, 1/25, 2/23 and 3/4. G and P typing were performed for all strains, and analysis sequencing revealed that two isolates (3/T and 7/T) were of G6P[5] serotype and seven (3/25, 3/34, 1/10, 2/20, 2/12, 8045, 9864) were of G10P[14] serotype.

Our study constitutes a crucial and a necessary step allowing preventive and veterinary medicine to support RVA disease controls in the country. RVA could be isolated from 60 % of clinical fecal samples and the efficient isolation procedure depends on four major factors:The use of a sensitive and permissible cell line, such as MA104.The use of an optimal trypsin concentration both for viral activation (10-15 \u00b5g/inoculum) and penetration and propagation (0.5\u20131 \u00b5g/ml).An adequate washing of cells before viral adsorption.An adequate storage of viral particles after collection.",

Diagnosis of RVA infection was based on positive fecal immune-chromatographic rapid test (Rota-Check-1 test -Veda-lab France-). All isolated were evaluated for their hemagglutination (HA) activity using red blood cells as described by the microtiter method [13]. Hemagglutination titers were determined by serial dilutions of 50 \u00b5l of antigen in Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (CAT No. 211-410-QK, Wisent Bioproducts). These were mixed with 50 \u00b5l of chicken\u2019s erythrocyte suspension (0.1 %). The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
