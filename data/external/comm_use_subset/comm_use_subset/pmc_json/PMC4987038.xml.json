One of the reasons researchers could share genetic sequences effectively during the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, besides longstanding openness norms in the community, was their familiarity with public databases designed for such data (e.g., GenBank). Widely accepted central databases do not exist for other types of research data. Clinical trial data, for example, mostly reside in independent databases and are collected under various standards [35]. Some platforms are little more than \u201cdata dumpsters\u201d without the metadata, data dictionaries, or documentation required for responsible analysis [36].
