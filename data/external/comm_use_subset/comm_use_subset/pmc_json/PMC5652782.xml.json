            "text": "Prostate cancer (PC) represents the second cause of cancer mortality in men, mainly because patients relapse to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) two years after androgen ablation. The final treatment option is chemotherapy (docetaxel), but the median overall survival is only two/three months. Recently, cabazytaxel and Abiraterone has been approved as chemo- and endocrine-therapy agents but overall survival is only around 12 to 18 months [1, 2]. The actual therapeutic strategy to delay or prevent the emergence of the castration-refractory phenotype in advanced PC involves targeting genes activated by androgen withdrawal (for review [3]). Hsp27, a heat shock protein involved in pleiotropic cell functions [4] (for review [5]) is a highly overexpressed gene in CRPC [6, 7]. Aberrant expression of Hsp27 has been associated with tumor growth, resistance to hormonal therapy, cell death inhibition, and poor prognosis [6\u20139]. Silencing of Hsp27 expression by the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) increases apoptotic rates, induces tumor regression and enhances hormone- and chemotherapy in PC [6, 7]. Despite excellent results observed in relevant clinical trials (\nhttp://www.oncogenex.ca/) the functional role of stress-induced Hsp27 in castration or chemotherapy-induced cell death remains poorly defined. The purpose of our work is to elucidate the pathways leading Hsp27 action in CRPC and to find new specific therapeutic targets and treatment strategy for CRPC that would have limited toxicity for normal tissues. Using two-hybrid experiment, we previously found that Hsp27 plays a major role in the protein translational initiation process [10]. These data led us to investigate the protein synthesis initiation pathway, a prerequisite for cell growth and proliferation. Thus, by northern and western blot analysis we found that Hsp27 down-regulation decreased eIF4E expression only at the protein level, without affecting mRNA content. The cytoprotection afforded by Hsp27 overexpression was attenuated by eIF4E knockdown using specific eIF4E siRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that Hsp27 co-localizes and interacts directly with eIF4E. Hsp27-eIF4E interaction decreases eIF4E ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. By chaperoning eIF4E, Hsp27 protects the protein synthesis initiation process to enhance cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Forced over-expression of eIF4E induced resistance to androgen-withdrawal and docetaxel treatment in the prostate LNCaP cells line in vitro. In aggregate, these findings identified Hsp27 as a modulator of eIF4E and established a potential mechanism for the eIF4E-regulated cell death after androgen ablation and chemotherapy. Accordingly, targeting Hsp27-eIF4E interaction may serve as a therapeutic option in advanced PC [10].",

Many approaches over the years have been used to try to inhibit eIF4E functions, particularly the use of small molecule inhibitors that can disrupt the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, the use of cap analogs to directly target the eIF4E cap-binding site, or ASOs that have been proven to be efficient in reducing the expression level of eIF4E and are tested in many clinical trials in prostate cancer patients [12].",

To evaluate how the Hsp27/eIF4E interaction is involved in chemo-resistance, cells were transfected with the Hsp27 deletion mutants prior to docetaxel treatment in combination with androgen deprivation in rat colon carcinoma cancer cell line (REG) cells that have no endogeneous expression of Hsp27. The analysis of cells viability showed that cells sensitivity to chemotherapy (docetaxel) and androgen withdrawal (serum free media) increased in the presence of the N1 and N2 mutants (Figure 1d).

A per-residue binding enthalpy (\u0394Hbind,res) analysis [13, 14] allowed to determine which Hsp27 residues are mainly involved in this interaction (Figure 1j). Accordingly, we found that WT Hsp27 binds the initiation factor mainly by exploiting the initial residues of the domain WDPF (W=tryptophan, D=aspartic acid, P=prolin and F=phenylalanine) and the final residues of the flexible domain in the C-terminal region, these last providing a favorable contribution to the binding two times larger than that afforded by the amino acids of the N-terminal part (Figure 1k).",

As expected, the \u0394Gbind values of the truncated forms were all less favorable compared to the WT protein (Table 1). Yet, a specific trend could be clearly discerned. Indeed, the presence of the C-terminal part still endow the Hsp27 C1 mutant with good eIF4E binding capability, inducing only a small decrease in binding affinity with respect to the WT (\u0394Gbind(C1) = -9.99 kcal/mol). On the other hand, the Hsp27 N2 isoform is still able to maintain a minimal affinity against the eIF4E through its WDPF residues; however, the absence of the C-terminal region leads to a strong reduction of the interaction surface (Figure 1h) and this, in turn, reflects into a loss of almost 6 kcal/mol in \u0394Gbind (Table 1). Lastly, the presence of the sole WDPF domain in the N1 Hsp27 mutant form allows the formation of a network of very weak interactions with eIF4E, reflecting in a plummet of ~9 kcal/mol in the relevant value of \u0394Gbind (Table 1, Figure 1i). In aggregate, our in silico results confirmed that the most important interactions involved in binding of the Hsp27 protein with the initiation factor eIF4E are provided by its C-terminal part, strictly in agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation experiments.",

We confirmed the interaction between fusion protein Hsp27/YFPC-ter and fusion protein N-terluc/eIF4E in HEK293T living cells (Figure 2b). BRET signal with the same couple of proteins was obtained as previously described for BRET experiment on living cells (Figure 2c). Next, to identify potential inhibitors of the Hsp27/eIF4E interaction, a screening of chemical compounds on cell extracts was carried out. We performed our screening using phenazine derivatives that were previously shown to have an anti-tumor activity in pancreatic and prostatic cell lines [15, 16] and structure similar to inhibitors of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction (Figure 2d). At the same time, we tested the compound \u201c4E2RCat\u201d reported in literature as an inhibitor of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, in order to see if it also inhibited the Hsp27/eIF4E interaction [17, 18] (Figure 2e). Of all compounds tested, only 14 revealed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the Hsp27/eIF4E interaction (Figure 2f). Other phenazine derivatives, as well as 4E2RCat, showed no significant inhibition (not shown). To see if this inhibition was specifically due to Hsp27/eIF4E interaction rather than to non-specific protein degradations, 14 was tested on an irrelevant couple of proteins, CCND3/Luc and CDK6/YFP. The result showed no inhibition of this interaction by 14, supporting the specificity of Hsp27/eIF4E interaction inhibition (Figure 2g). This screening allowed us to highlight 14 as the first compound that potentially inhibits Hsp27/eIF4E interaction.",

Until recently, the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel represented the treatment of choice after castration resistance emerged, prolonging the mean life span of patients for 2.9 months [20]. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, mRNA splicing events, gene fusions, loss of expression of tumor suppressor genes, post-transcriptional modification using miRNA, and epigenetic alterations are all hallmarks of CRPC [3]. Hsp27 has numerous cytoprotective functions and is involved in cell migration, cytoskeleton architecture, cell growth, differentiation, and tumor progression [21]. Despite the promising clinical trial results of Hsp27 inhibitor (OGX427, Apatorsen), long-term inhibition of the survival protein Hsp27 might be accompanied by cytotoxic effects due to the role of this protein in several physiological processes [22]. To avoid this problem, an alternative therapeutic strategy consists of using compounds that disrupt specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between Hsp27 and partners that mediate its cytoprotective effects [10, 21, 23].",

In this study, we sought to further characterize important facets of the interaction between Hsp27 and eIF4E. First, using both co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 1) and BRET assays (Figure 2), we demonstrated that the interaction between Hsp27 and eIF4E may involve the C-terminal domain of Hsp27, and that loss of this interaction restores chemo- and hormone-sensitivity of PC. Next, we determined that phosphorylation of Hsp27 enhances its interaction with eIF4E (Figure 1f\u20131g). Finally, we identified and characterized the first compound, 14 able to inhibit the Hsp27/eIF4E interaction (Figure 3).",

Structure and function studies indicate that the chaperone properties of Hsp27 correlate with the ability of the protein to form large oligomers, which are mediated by the non-phosphorylated form of Hsp27 [24, 25]. On the other hand, the triple mutant phosphorylated (3D) mimic is capable of forming at most tetramers and has less chaperone activity than the wild type protein [26].",

This interaction further avoids MDM2/AR binding and promotes MDM2 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome [27]. Our work indicates that Hsp27 has a similar role on eIF4E, protecting it from degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system and allowing maintenance of protein synthesis. The hypothesis of the \u201csorting\u201d function of this protein is reinforced by the fact that Hsp27 seems to be selective with respect to targets to be degraded. For example, it acts on p27 kip1 but has no action on other cell cycle proteins such as cyclin A, E, D1 or \u03b2-catenin [28, 29].",

Thus, different portions of the Hsp27 molecule may be responsible for mediating the response to different stimuli. For example, the C-terminal domain may be largely responsible for the response to stress, whereas the N-terminal could be responsible for modulating hormonal signaling [30]. Another study indicates that the C-terminal of Hsp27 retains its flexibility during the interaction with dithiothereitol and suggests a highly flexible C-terminal in mammalian sHSPs is required for full chaperone activity [31].",

Figure 4f reveals that the Ki-67 level of compound 14 treatment group was much lower than those of the alternative treatment group (PBS), indicating lower cell proliferation in tumors and hence higher antitumor activity of 14. In this study, we managed to determine the site interaction between two proteins considered as therapeutic targets in PC. Indeed, eIF4E is considered to be a proto-oncogene and its overexpression causes tumorigenic transformation of fibroblasts [35], while the overexpression of Hsp27 causes the resistance of tumor cells to treatment. The rationale of targeting Hsp27/eIF4E interaction is that long-term inhibition of two proteins separately may be toxic for the cells. Indeed, Hsp27 is a multifunctional protein involved in several biological processes and long inhibition of eIF4E leads to deregulation and malfunction of the translation initiation mechanism disrupting the process of cell transformation.",

In conclusion, the phenazine-derivative 14 could represent an interesting therapeutic option to restore hormone- and chemo-sensitivity in late stage of the disease where there is no therapeutic alternative. We are currently working to improve solubility and biodisponibilty of this phenazine 14 compound by using nucleolipids nanovectors in order to be tested in further clinical trials.",

Specifically, the ligand is docked between a \u03b1-helix of eIF4E protein spanning residue L117*-E132* and a structurally hybrid region from E185* to I193*. The ligand is portrayed in ball-and-stick representation and colored by element (C, gray; N, blue; O, red). The main protein residues involved in compound binding are depicted as gold sticks and labelled. Transparent light blue spheres represent water oxygen atoms, while chlorine and sodium ions and counterions are shown as green and purple spheres, respectively. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. (Right Panel) Per residue binding enthalpy decomposition for eIF4E residues mainly involved in binding with 14. Only those Hsp27 amino acids affording a meaningful contribution to protein-drug formation (\u0394Hbind,res* < -0.50 kcal/mol) are shown for clarity. The network of stabilizing hydrophobic interaction involves the two C12 alkyl chains of the 14 and the side chain of the protein residue L117*, N118*, F129*, L189*, P190*, K192*, and I193*. The two amine substituents of 14 are engaged in two persistent polar interactions with the carboxylic side chain of E132* and E185*. In addition, a further stabilizing interaction via a weak hydrogen bond between the side chain of R128* and a nitrogen atom of the phenazine ring is detected. (b) (Left panel) MD simulation distance between the charged side chains of E132* and R186* in the eIF4E alone (red line) and in the eIF4E/14 complex (salmon line). In the eIF4E free protein, the two \u03b1-helixes spanning residues Q122*-I138* and R173*-G188*, respectively, are persistently stabilized by the presence of permanent interaction points between the side chain of their residues. In particular, a strong polar interaction between the charged side chain of the amino acids E132* and R186* is detected. As shown, the Average Dynamics Length (ADL) of this interaction between the two involved atoms is 2.96 \u00c5, and its persistence is verified along the entire MD run. Conversely, the same distance progressively increases during the first part of the simulations and finally settles around 9\u00c5 when the eIF4F is simulated in presence of the ligand. The reason for this behavior can be explained by that fact that E132* is engaged in a polar interaction with 14, as demonstrated by the complementary trend exhibited of the corresponding distance between the carboxylic moiety of E132* and the amine group of 14 shown in the right panel (MD simulation distance between the N2 nitrogen atom of 14 and the charged side chain of E132* (blue line), and between the N3 nitrogen atom of 14 and the charged side chain of E185* (green line). (c) (Left panel) Overall view of an equilibrated MD snapshot of the Hsp27 WT/eIF4E/14 complex. All molecules are visualized by their van der Waals surfaces, colored as follow: WT Hsp27, firebrick; eIF4E, khaki; 14, navy blue. The amino acids of Hsp27 mainly involved in binding eIF4E are highlighted as follows: purple, residues belonging to the WDPF domain; green, residues belonging to the flexible domain. The residues of eIF4E mainly involved in binding with 14 are depicted in gold. (Upper right panel) Binding free energies (\u0394Gbind) and binding free energy differences (\u0394Gbind) for the WT Hsp27/eIF4E (plain filled columns) and the WT Hsp27/eIF4E/14 (patterned filled columns) complexes. (Lower right panel) Comparison of the clustered per residue enthalpic contribution to binding for WT Hsp27/eIF4E and WT Hsp27/eIF4E/14 complexes.

Cell death quantification (SubG0 phase) using flow cytometry (b) was performed on PC-3 cells non treated (NT) or treated with compound 14 at 100\u03bcM during 48h. Cell viability using MTT assay was also performed on PC-3-docetaxel resistant cells non treated (NT) or treated with compound 14 (c) at different concentrations (25, 50, 100\u03bcM) during 48h. (d) PC-3 cells were subcutaneously implanted in Node Scids by injection of 10 \u00d710 6 cells in the right flank of animals. When tumors reached 100mm3, mice were randomized in two groups that received twice a week an intra-peritoneal injection of PBS (control n = 6, blue) and phenazine 14 (n = 8, green) (1 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Tumor volume was measured once weekly and calculated by the formula length x width x depth x 0.5236. Compound 14 reduced significantly PC-3 tumor volume by up to 50%. During the entire treatment period, all mice treated with PBS and 14 did not show any abnormal behavior, and no significant alteration of mice body weight was observed.
