Although infrequently recognised, RSV infection is common in adults and sometimes causes severe illness especially in the elderly [2,3]. RSV infection presents with similar clinical symptoms to other respiratory viral infections, including influenza [4,5]. Influenza is associated with increased general practice consultation rates [6], increased hospital admissions [7] and excess deaths [7,8]. RSV and influenza viruses frequently co-circulate around the same time of the year making it difficult to estimate their separate clinical impacts [9]. The contribution of RSV to influenza-like illness needs to be assessed if this is to be used as a clinical endpoint for evaluating influenza vaccine effectiveness [10,11].",

A timely RSV surveillance system could be valuable in optimizing the use of palivizumab by increasing its efficiency and reducing costs [14] as doctors would become aware of the circulation of the virus and probable cause of illness in high-risk infants.",

In addition, general practitioners in Scotland were requested to sample patients with acute respiratory infections in the absence of influenza-like illness. The respiratory specimens were transported to participating laboratories mainly by regular mail [18]. Similar laboratory methods were used in three out of four countries (Table 1); France used enzyme-linked assays including ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) instead of RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) [19]. Although the sensitivity of ELISA has been reported to be lower than RT-PCR, ELISA is reliable for rapid laboratory diagnosis of influenza in infants and young children; for older patients application of virus isolation or RT-PCR is necessary [20].

The EISS system has demonstrated timeliness in providing data on influenza and as this report shows in four countries, timely data on RSV. Sentinel data indicated that RSV contributed considerably to influenza-like illness, especially in young children. Since the infrastructure of EISS is well established [24], we suggest the use of EISS as a model for setting up an RSV surveillance system in Europe.",

For common respiratory infections, there are many more infected persons in the community who do not consult their doctor. Selection biases which start with the decision to consult are compounded at the point of consultation. In addition, sensible use of virological investigation does not necessarily mean that every suspect case is investigated. Certainly as far as patients in the community are concerned, routine virological investigation for a common condition which is usually minor is not economically justifiable. Furthermore, the patient's willingness to be sampled will always be a major consideration.",

Sentinel networks in Europe are chiefly based on general practices (and in some European countries also on paediatric primary care services) and these are essential to provide insight into what is happening in the community at large. However, the hospital admission is a useful proxy for severity of illness and it is desirable therefore to have access to additional hospital source data. This is particularly important when an illness is common in all age groups but hospital admission is much more likely in particular age groups. Accordingly we wish to encourage data collection from hospitals either on a routine basis from all hospitals or perhaps more thought might be given to the development of sentinel hospitals with a higher level of commitment to high quality data capture and more structured virological investigation.",

Within EISS the need for harmonization of laboratory methods is recognised and a Community Network of Reference Laboratories has been established in 2003. This Network encourages the harmonisation of laboratory methods for the detection of influenza in EISS and assesses the quality of laboratory testing for influenza and RSV [25].",

The majority of sentinel respiratory specimens did not test positive for either influenza or RSV. This may be explained by other respiratory viruses that are known to cause symptoms similar to influenza and RSV infection [29,30] but few are regularly investigated. As an example, for Scotland, 83 (13.9%) sentinel swabs tested positive for picornavirus during the 2002\u20132003 winter season. Furthermore, positivity rates differed considerably between countries: e.g. in Scotland the percentage positive for RSV and influenza was only 8%. In the future, the EISS might implement more respiratory viruses for surveillance purposes simultaneously after introducing RSV. Nine countries in EISS already tested sentinel specimens for more viruses than RSV and influenza in 2002, e.g. for human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, C. pneumoniae or para-influenza virus.",
