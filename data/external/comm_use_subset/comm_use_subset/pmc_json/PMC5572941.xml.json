Upon arriving at the airport, the patient took a taxi to a hotel and checked in before leaving to a private hospital in another taxi. Upon presentation at the emergency room at the private hospital, the patient was promptly diagnosed with heart failure and possible pneumonia. As the patient had travelled from the Middle East that day, MERS was suspected and he was isolated in a negative pressure room (NPU). On day 3, the private hospital notified the Bureau of Epidemiology, under the Thai MOPH, of the Omani patient. RT-PCR for MERS-CoV on upper respiratory tract samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) that were sent on days 2 and 3 resulted in false negatives, leading to a 48-hour delay in diagnosis and a decision to transfer the patient out of the negative pressure unit (NPU) on day 3. Subsequent examination of a sputum sample later on day 3 confirmed MERS-CoV infection in the patient. The patient was immediately transferred back into the NPU. On day 4, Thailand\u2019s MOPH officially reported the first imported MERS case and the patient was transferred from the private hospital to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute (BIDI).",

At the hotel, potential contacts were identified by interviewing the personnel on-duty when the patient checked in and by using the hotel\u2019s surveillance camera. The investigation team from the Department of Disease Control (DDC) at the Thai MOPH identified the airport-to-hotel taxi driver using the airport taxi booking slip and the hotel-to-hospital taxi driver by looking at the surveillance camera from the Traffic Control Department. The airline provided the investigation team with the passenger manifest and the Thai authorities identified passengers\u2019 local address using immigration arrival cards. Local health authorities in relevant provinces were informed and asked by the investigation team to locate and contact the identified passengers in their jurisdiction. Some passengers voluntarily reported to a hospital or health authority in response to the MOPH\u2019s announcement of first imported MERS case in Thailand. Central authorities were responsible for locating all high-risk close-contacts, while local authorities were responsible for low-risk contacts. The time lapse between the affirmed diagnosis and each contact-tracing varied. Contacts at the hospital were identified within a day, while other high-risk close contacts, such as passengers on the flight, were identified within 3 days. Other low-risk contacts were traced within 7 days.",

He only had a mild, non-productive cough. This case report also provides important lessons regarding clinical case identification. The clinical diagnosis was complicated due to the existence of congestive heart failure, a condition that predisposes to either community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia of various aetiologies. Furthermore, initial chest radiographs did not show clear signs of interstitial pneumonia as expected with MERS-CoV infection. Various contact tracing methods involving the cooperation of several authorities and business institutes, such as the border control, airline, hotel management, traffic control, local authorities and hospitals, were used to track-down all potential contacts in order to prevent an outbreak.

This aligns with the WHO interim guidelines, which encourage using lower respiratory tract samples if available [8]. Physicians, surveillance staff and laboratory personnel must be well-informed about the procedures, reliability and limitations of diagnostic tests, and should be able to recognise signs of mismatch between laboratory results and clinical presentations. In this case, the initial diagnostic testing of upper respiratory tract samples on days 2 and 3 caused a delay in diagnosis that could have facilitated onward transmission. Fortunately, the patient was isolated in a NPU upon initial admission; however, he could have exposed other patients and hospital workers during the 8 hours he spent in regular ICU after the initial false negative test results.
