The nature of these models and data means that there are not simple optimal values for the rate parameters, but instead the data constrain the parameters to lie close to a nonlinear curve in parameter space. We show that modern computationally intensive Bayesian methods that make use of information geometry can be used to calculate the posterior density for models of influenza, norovirus and Ebola. We then use forward modelling based on this posterior knowledge to show that some epidemiological conclusions are robust under the remaining uncertainty, but others require additional information to determine. In particular, for influenza, we show that the predicted effectiveness of quarantine-type interventions is unaffected by the remaining uncertainty, but antiviral-like interventions have a bimodal uncertainty structure. For norovirus, we show that the frequency of epidemics is predictable under the remaining uncertainty, but the severity and timing of each seasonal epidemic is not. For Ebola, we are able to distinguish between high- and low-viraemic infectious disease progression, giving results that are consistent with population-level observations of the case fatality ratio.",

Our results show that the epidemiological consequences of uncertainty in natural history parameters can often be highly significant since these are important for interventions such as reducing transmission through quarantine or medication, as well as prediction of long-term disease behaviour and clinical outcomes. Natural history parameters also strongly affect other aspects of infectious disease epidemiology such as outbreak reconstruction and we would expect similarly strong effects in these contexts.",

One example is that the simple likelihood functions (2.18) and (2.17) assume independence that could be extended to include more general functional relationships, which would be particularly important if the methodology were extended to diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus where there are very different time scales involved in passing between compartments [43]. In such an example, one might wish to consider more general models, for example, ones in which the progression between the latent, infectious and removed classes is governed by more general distributions than those we have considered here. Provided the Laplace transformations of the probability density functions for these distributions are available, then expressions for \u039b and its derivatives with respect to the parameters can be obtained via the convolution theorem, although this can result in a computationally intensive likelihood function. Alternatively, it might be possible to approximate the derivatives since inaccuracies in any such approximation will lead to algorithmic inefficiency rather than bias.",
