Her measured temperature at the arrival gate was 38.6 \u00b0C by thermoscanner, and confirmed with a tympanic thermometer. After being interviewed by quarantine officers, she was transferred to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute (BIDI) Hospital, Nonthaburi, for isolation and laboratory investigations. She reported a runny nose and sore throat but no dyspnea or diarrhoea. Upon admission, her vital signs were normal except for elevated blood pressure. Her physical examination was unremarkable including inconspicuous lung sounds. Her complete blood count suggested a viral infection from relatively decreased neutrophil (48%; norm: 35\u201375%) to lymphocyte (40%; norm: 20\u201359%) ratio [8]. The chest X-ray (CXR) results on 8 January were compatible with pneumonia with mild thickening lung marking at both lower lungs possibly because of crowded lung rather than infiltration. It also showed borderline cardiomegaly. Repeat CXR after 7 days showed no remarkable changes.",

Follow-up CXR on 17 January additionally showed recent hazy with reticular opacities at left middle lung field. The patient was not in severe condition but stable.",

Although within-outbreak sequence divergence is low for this virus, identical genomes of up to 30 kb are rare and a strong sign of recent transmission linkage, albeit with unknown number of generations within the transmission chain. The missing link to the market, the time of travel and onset of symptoms in the two COVID-19 cases together with the incubation period of mean 6.4 days (range: 5.6\u20137.7) [16] and the time of closest genome neighbours obtained from sequences in Wuhan, suggest that transmission within Wuhan beyond the Huanan Seafood Market is likely to have occurred in the first week of January or earlier. People travelling out of the city since then may have spread the virus further before travel restrictions were enforced on 23 January [17].",

The two cases described here who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were the first confirmed exported cases from China, suggesting early international spread. Therefore, while one cannot exclude the possibility that asymptomatic cases in their incubation period would be missed and become infectious later, screening of incoming travellers from an affected area proved successful at least in these two instances, when COVID-19 cases were detected, isolated, observed and only discharged once they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid response including genome sequencing and sharing via GISAID [18,19] (https://www.gisaid.org/) enabled fast dissemination of results and provided a glimpse of early transmission patterns in this outbreak.",
