Besides their social and healthcare impacts, severe infectious disease outbreaks also present an important burden to the economy through the decrease in productivity and high cost of treatment. As denser populations promote faster spreading, this problem can only grow in severity and magnitude with the increasing world population density. Motivated by this, many works have been done to predict [1], [2] or even contain [3]\u2013[6] the spread of severe epidemics. In spite of these efforts, effective control of infectious disease outbreaks continues to elude us.",

This strategy involves estimating the infection network of a severe disease using incidences data from common infections sharing the same infection network, and fragmenting the network into disconnected pieces using a graph partitioning method. To test the proposed strategy in principle, we first generate artificial social networks of different sizes but with roughly the same clustering characteristics to serve as our infection networks. Then we simulate multiple SIR epidemics on the networks to play the role of common infections circulating in society. We apply censorships on the incidence data collected to emulate the low reporting rates of common infections, and use the censored incidences to construct estimates of the original infection networks. To mitigate new epidemics, we fragment the estimated infection networks. To do this, we apply a graph partitioning method on the estimated networks to identify the smallest sets of nodes that, when removed, will efficiently break the networks up into isolated pieces. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of this targeted strategy by comparing against traditional untargeted methods. While each of the problems has been studied independently (see for example [8], [18] for network reconstruction and [19]\u2013[22] for graph partitioning), to the best of our knowledge no work has been done applying both methods to control epidemics.",

This is done by first picking nm intermediate nodes at random, before choosing two neighbours of each to become the pairs. In addition to this, we choose nr other pairs of nodes uniformly at random, with nm>nr. For every pair that is not already connected, we form a new link between them provided that both nodes have not reached the maximum number of friends L. At the end of each time step, we randomly break r existing links to simulate the friendship decay. We then calculate the clustering coefficient c of the network using the method by Schank and Wagner [29]. After the clustering coefficient stops increasing and only fluctuates about a time-independent long-run average, we say the network has converged and stop the simulation.

Suppose some of these incidences were censored, and we ended up with the censored incidences {9}, {5}, {4, 11, 13}, {8} at time steps t = 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. Based on these censored incidences, we then draw a tentative link between nodes 9 and 5, because the infection of node 9 precedes the infection of node 5. We then draw tentative links between the pairs (5, 4), (5, 11), (5, 13) because the infection of node 5 precedes the infection of nodes 4, 11, 13. Finally, we draw a tentative link between the pairs (4, 8), (11, 8), (13, 8), because the infection of nodes 4, 11, 13 precedes the infection of node 8.",

We then repeat the estimation over more SIR epidemics. In subsequent epidemics, if an existing estimated link is reactivated, it is reinforced by adding \u0394w = 1.00 to its weight. We expect the algorithm to produce mostly wrong links at first. However, as the weights are decaying with time, most of the wrongly-estimated links will disappear at the end, because they will not consistently appear in the estimation process. On the other hand, correctly-estimated links tend to get constantly reinforced over multiple epidemics. Hence, we expect the population of correctly-estimated links to increase over time. More importantly, we note that existing estimation can always be further refined by incorporating new incidence data as and when they become available.",

This is why we need to accumulate information from successive epidemics to make consistent and reliable estimates of the network links that participate in the transmission. In Figure 4b, we show the estimation accuracy as a function of the number of different SIR epidemics S used in the estimation with 50% censor rate.

Figure 4a suggests that the estimation accuracy goes to zero at censor rate CT<100%. This implies that it might be difficult to do network estimation in the US, where censor rates for mild illnesses are close to 100% because of the expensive medical insurance and co-payments. However, we stand a better chance of making the scheme work in Singapore as the low medical cost and the necessity to obtain medical certificates to stay away from work promote doctor consultations even for mild symptoms. To further improve the accuracy, the incidence data can be easily complemented with other types of relevant data. For instance, cell-phone and GPS co-location information can be used to rule out a large proportion of tentative links connecting pairs of individuals that have never been found in the same location over the infection time step of about three days.

In subtropical countries, there is typically one flu season each year. So if the estimation is based solely on flu, it would take 100 years to obtain the estimated network. In Singapore, because of the tropical climate and high population density, there is anecdotal evidence that epidemics of mild respiratory infections come around every one or two months. Assuming there are six epidemics a year, the estimation above will take a much shorter time of 17 years in this country. The main risk of using multiple infections to shorten the estimation time is the increased number of wrong estimates when two epidemics overlap. However, this is a problem that cell phone and GPS co-location can help to solve as well.",

The results of Section 3.3 beautifully illustrate this, where targeted isolation based on an estimated network which is only 16.6% accurate is still very effective in mitigating epidemics (Figure 5a\u2013b). This unexpected effectiveness of EGP applied on an inaccurately estimated network prompted us to better understand why this is happening. A deeper look at the preliminary study which we can visualize suggests that, while the predicted links are inaccurate, the nodes that emerged from the estimation are mostly hubs and are concentrated along the backbones of the infection network. Hence, removal of these nodes will effectively slow the advancing epidemic. Naturally, we expect even better results with a more accurate estimation.",

Lack of medical attention and insufficient resources (medics, vaccines, and healthcare apparatus) might delay the recovery process and result to a higher number of casualties than need be. This is why it is important for an epidemic mitigation strategy to consider peak load reduction as a primary goal. Delaying the peak infection time, thus stretching the overall time scale of the epidemic, is also crucial. When dealing with a deadly epidemic caused by a new infection agent, chances are we would not have vaccine at hand, or even a vaccine development program. As development of vaccines and drugs for new diseases can only begin after cases have been confirmed and analyzed, the race against the epidemic to develop and administer such drugs would be inevitable. Delaying the progress of the epidemic will not only buy time for drug development, but will also give governments more time in general to implement other crisis handling measures.",

In a country like the US, this strategy is unlikely to be adopted no matter how well it is shown to work in simulation due to privacy concerns when we selectively isolate individuals according to EGP. However, the proposed strategy may find a more receptive audience in a country like Singapore, given that home quarantine orders have been issued by the Ministry of Health during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks. Here we must stress that node removals as suggested by EGP need not be home quarantine or any other physical isolation practices. If early vaccine stocks are available but limited, the EGP nodes should be the ones to receive it, because of the role they play in disease transmission. We must nevertheless be wary that this procedure should not be used as a mean of discrimination.",

Unlike conventional quarantine, this intervention involves isolating healthy individuals from the rest of the infection network. At first this might sounds absurd: \u201cWhy isolate healthy people and not the infected ones?\u201d From network point of view, however, the reason is clear: by isolating these people we are intercepting the path of an ongoing epidemic. As comparison, it is a standard practice in controlling forest fire to cut or burn down trees ahead of advancing fire to contain it. For infectious diseases no one has imagined this intervention possible, but with an estimated infection network our proof-of-concept results are impressive. If all nodes on the entire estimated network are isolated, the results are even more impressive: for our N = 10,000 network with <k> = 10, we find propagating epidemics in only 60% of the simulations. In these propagating epidemics, the epidemic peak with intervention is less than 1/10 the epidemic peak without intervention, while the total number of infections with intervention is 1/3 that without intervention. Also, instead of peaking at t = 12 and ending at t = 20 without intervention, the epidemic peaks at t = 28 and ends at t = 60 with intervention. In terms of actual durations, removing all nodes on the estimated network stretches two-month epidemics to over half a year. However, about 1/4 of the population needs to be isolated, compared to only about 9% of the population for EGP intervention. A separate systematic study will be necessary to understand how effective and efficient this more aggressive intervention strategy can be.",

We used computer simulations to study and show the effectiveness of the method. First, we followed the intuitive JGN method to generate artificial social network of various sizes but with roughly the same clustering characteristic to serve as the infection networks. We then simulated SIR epidemics on the artificial infection networks, recorded the incidences, and applied censorship with rates between 50% and 85% to mimic low reporting rates for mild infections. We then used the remaining incidence data to construct an estimate of the infection network using a modified JGN algorithm. We found that the estimation accuracy falls with increasing censor rate, average degree, and size of the network, but improves as more data from multiple epidemics are incorporated.",

We also applied the proposed strategy at different times after the epidemic has started and showed that it is still effective in decreasing the peak infection rate and total number of cases even when applied late into the epidemic. In particular, we demonstrated that the EGP based strategy is surprisingly effective in mitigating epidemics even when the estimated network is not very accurate. Through visualizing small network, we find that in spite of the large number of wrongly estimated links, the nodes appearing in the estimated network are concentrated along the backbones of the actual network and thus play important roles in the disease transmission.",
