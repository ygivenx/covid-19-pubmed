A recent study reported that Klebsiella pneumonia NDM-1 positive strain or Escherichia coli NDM-1 positive strain was highly resistant to all antibiotics tested except tigecycline and colistin [2]. Since August 2010, the spreading and dissemination of NDM-1 positive strain has occurred, with cases being globally reported by medias from countries including United States, Canada, Sweden, United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Germany, Africa, Oman, Australia, Japan and China [3]. Although NDM-1-positive cases are not currently prevalent in the worldwide, it can spread through renal or bone marrow transplantation, dialysis, cerebral infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pregnancy, burns, road traffic accidents, and cosmetic surgery. In addition, NDM-1 positive strain can destroy carbapenem antibiotics such as meropenem, imipenem, doripenem and ertapenem by breaking down the carbapenem groups of antibiotics, which have been serving as the basis for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and now can no longer be relied on for this purpose due to the emergence of NMD-1 positive strain. Therefore, the spread of the pathogenic microorganisms carrying NDM-1 gene (also been called \u201csuper bugs\u201d) now becomes potentially a major global health threat.",

It inactivates almost all classes of \u03b2-lactams antibiotics including carbapenems by catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of the substrate amide bond. On the basis of the protein sequence similarities, three different lineages, named as subclass B1, B2 and B3 have been characterized. A number of experimental and theoretical studies have also been devoted to understanding structural and mechanistic properties of MBLs [4], [5], [6], [7]. However, since this novel MBL\u2014NDM-1 is likely more potent and extensive than known MBLs in inactivating \u03b2-lactams antibiotics, it is urgent for us to address the ligand binding properties and catalytic mechanism of NDM-1 in order to light up the road for the development of novel antibiotics to combat emerging NDM-1 positive pathogen.",

Then molecular docking method was applied to obtain the binding modes with antibiotics and the comparison of NDM-1 with other MBLs complexes was also investigated. In addition, NDM-1 catalyzed hydrolysis of various antibiotics substrates was monitored by following the absorbance variations resulting from the opening of the \u03b2-lactam ring, which suggested that NDM-1 displays different resistant abilities to different kinds of antibiotics. Based on the modeling results, four point mutants, including D124A, C208A, K211A and K211E, were made and their enzymatic activities were measured comparing with the wild-type. The significantly decreased activity of mutants validated the accuracy of our model. On the other hand, it shed light on the catalytic mechanism of the novel NDM-1 from the molecular basis for the first time. Furthermore, enzymatic activities toward different antibiotics tested in our study would provide clues to accelerate the new antibiotics design against NDM-1 positive strain in further studies.",

In addition, sequence alignment indicates that NDM-1 contains the identical coordinating residues (His-His-His) in the Zn2+(I)-binding site and (Asp-Cys-His) in the Zn2+(II)-binding site of the B1 subclass, which implies that NDM-1 belongs to the B1 subclass of MBLs. Accordingly, the crystal structure of VIM-4 (PDB ID: 2WHG) was used as the template in homology modeling [8]. As shown in Figure 1B, the overall structure of NDM-1 shares the common characteristic folding of \u03b1\u03b2/\u03b2\u03b1 sandwich, which resembles the architectural features in other B1 subclass. The active site of NDM-1 is highly homologous to that of VIM-4. In the active site (Figure 2A), Zn2+(I) is coordinated with three conserved histidine residues 120, 122 and 189, while Zn2+(II) is coordinated with the conserved residues Asp124, Cys208 and His250, which is exactly consistent with the X-ray crystal structures [9], [10]. A water molecule bridging both zinc ions acts as the nucleophile during the \u03b2-lactam hydrolysis.",

            "text": "Two mobile loops in the active site shown in Figure 1B are crucial for substrate recognition, binding and catalysis in MBLs [11], [12]. In NDM-1, the loop1, also called the flapping loop, is composed of amino acids LDMPGFGAVA (residues 65\u201374). Compared with the loop1 (QSFDGAVYP) in VIM-2 and VIM-4, the size of the active site cavity is enlarged with less bulky amino acids, suggesting a broader substrate profile. Besides it is worth noting that it is more hydrophobic than others [9]. There is only one benzene ring of Phe70 in the middle of the loop1 of NDM-1, and the side-chains of Asp66 and Met67 pointed to the solvent, the less bulky amino acids, especially for the glycines, are proposed to make the loop1 more flexible for substrate binding. In the crystal structure of NDM-1 in complex with hydrolyzed ampicillin (PDB ID: 3Q6X) [9], the loop1 represents a more open state compared with our model, while in the crystal structure of apo NDM-1 (PDB ID: 3S0Z) [10], the loop1 displays a semi-closed state. Consequently, it is proposed to undergo significant conformational changes during the substrate binding, in different states with or without substrate. Regarding the loop2, Arg185 and Asn190 in VIM-2 was proved to play important roles for substrate binding, catalysis and inhibition through H-bond interactions [12], [13]. While in NDM-1, the arginine is mutated to Ala215, which also enlarges the size of active site cavity. Moreover, Lys211 instead of Tyr181 in VIM-2, probably plays the similar role of Arg185 in VIM-2 by forming electrostatic interaction with the carboxyl of substrate. The detailed comparison of the two loops in NDM-1 and VIM-2 is shown in Figure 2B. Furthermore, two residues, Lys125 and Tyr229, were pointed to play crucial roles in stabilizing the conformation of the active site, through H-bond network (with residues Asn76, Asp90, Thr91, His122 and Ser249) and hydrophobic interactions (with residues Leu209, Leu218, Leu221 and Leu269) [9]. Besides the unique residues in the two loops, the N terminus of NDM-1 is longer than other analogues. Even without modeled in our structure, it is speculated to assist in loop1 packing so as to affect the hydrolytic catalysis. NDM-1 also contains an additional insert between residues 162 and 166, which is not present in other MBLs. Since the insert is in the opposite side of the active site, with a distance of around 20 \u00c5, its role in the hydrolysis reaction is still unknown. In summary, the unique structural characteristics probably contributes to the more potent hydrolysis and broader substrate range of the novel MBL\u2014NDM-1, especially for those bulkier antibiotics, which are not degraded by other MBLs.",

Two reported effective antibiotics (tigecycline and colistin) against NDM-1 positive strains [2] and other 13 well-known antibiotics including carbapenem, which were reported to be destroyed by NDM-1 positive pathogen, were docked into the active site of NDM-1. The molecular docking data indicates that the latter 13 antibiotics fit the active site of NDM-1 quite well. Taking two typical antibiotics, imipenem and carbapenem as example, the docked complex structures revealed that although the antibiotics adopted diverse conformations in the active site, the lactam motifs were positioned in the same orientation by coordinating with zinc ions tightly (Figure 2C), which suggested that the catalytic mechanisms were highly conserved among B1 subclass enzymes, as shown in Figure 3. Substrate-binding polarizes the lactam bond due to coordination of the carbonyl oxygen with Zn2+(I) and the lactam nitrogen with Zn2+(II). Attack of the water oxygen leads to oxyanion stabilized by Zn2+(I), which is followed by subsequent cleavage of the C-N bond. Then, the lactam nitrogen is expelled as an anion and stabilized by coordination with Zn2+(II) acting as a general acid. The last step is the protonation of the nitrogen, which is considered as the rate-limiting and the most controversial step to date [4]. Compare to other known B1 subclass enzymes such as VIM-2 and VIM-4, the loop2 of NDM-1 harbors a lysine-rich positive-charged region, which is more favorable for protonation, probably accounting for its potent catalytic activity at least in part. Notably, colistin, the reported antibiotic susceptible for NDM-1 positive pathogens, was not able to fit the active site well probably due to its bulky volume.",

            "text": "To gain the structural insight into the mechanism of the potent hydrolysis of NDM-1, the intermolecular interactions of three models of NDM-1, VIM-2 and FEZ-1 in complex with antibiotics meropenem were compared and analyzed in details (Figure 4A\u2013C). In NDM-1 complex structure, the lactam oxygen and the carboxyl oxygen atoms coordinate with Zn2+(I) and Zn2+(II) with distances of 3.56 \u00c5 and 2.64 \u00c5 respectively. In addition, the H-bond between the atom N\u03942 of Asn220 and the lactam oxygen atom with distance of 2.96 \u00c5 also contributes to the polarization of the lactam bond. Meanwhile, the water molecule, which bridges with the two zinc ions with distances of 1.88 \u00c5 and 2.40 \u00c5 respectively, can serve as the nucleophile to attack the atom C of \u03b2-lactam. The carbonyl methyl of meropenem forms H-bonds with the atom N\u03b52 of Gln123. Together with the fact that the relatively bulky active site cavity caused by the residue variations in the flexible loop1, NDM-1 is potent to hydrolyze bulkier antibiotics. Different with NDM-1/meropenem, the VIM-2/meropenem has a strong H-bond between the carboxyl of meropenem and Arg185 in the loop2. Moreover, Phe61 and Try67 in the loop1 form hydrophobic interactions with meropenem, and dramatically reduce the size of the active site cavity. Structurally, the hydrophobic interactions make the lactam ring rotate to the loop1 and elongate the distance between the lactam oxygen and Zn2+(I) to 4.3 \u00c5. (Figure 4B) Consequently, the shallow active site makes the lactam more difficult to be positioned in a proper orientation for catalysis, which probably explains its weaker activity to catalyze antibiotics compared with NDM-1. In contrast, FEZ-1 shares little structural similarity with NDM-1 and VIM-2, especially for that the flapping loop is not conserved in FEZ-1, which leads to a flat active site cleft [14]. Obviously,meropenem mediates no other interactions with FEZ-1 except for the lactam motif (Figure 4C), suggesting the low binding affinity for substrates. And the FEZ-1/meropenem flexible characteristic makes the antibiotic little access to proper orientation for hydrolysis. In agreement with our intermolecular interaction models of enzymes with antibiotics, the reported minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for VIM-2 and FEZ-1 positive E.coli strains are both 0.25 \u00b5g/ml, while for NDM-1 positive E.coli strain, it is 32 \u00b5g/ml [2], [15], suggesting that NDM-1 is probably more potent in antibiotics hydrolysis. Besides, the binding modes of hydrolyzed antibiotics were also investigated. Taking the hydrolyzed meropenem for example (Figure 5), it is noticed that the original carboxyl formed electrostatic interactions with Lys211. The hydrophobic residues such as Leu65, Val73 and Ala74 in the loop1 formed stable hydrophobic interactions with the dimethylamino group. It appears that the conformations of antibiotics undergo slight exchange during the catalysis.",

More than 95% pure NDM-1 protein was obtained by final gel filtration chromatography (Figure 6A, B and C). Secondly, the NDM-1 catalyzed hydrolysis of various antibiotics substrates was monitored by following the absorbance variations resulting from the opening of the \u03b2-lactam ring. The susceptibilities of seven typical antibiotics were assessed. The chemical structures of these antibiotics are displayed in Figure 7. As shown in Figure 8A, NDM-1 rapidly hydrolyzes the carbapenem antibiotics including meropenem and imipenem, and it harbored moderate catalytic hydrolysis ability against cephalosporin antibiotics, including ceftazidime, cefotaxime and cefpirome. In contrast, NDM-1 is susceptible to tigecycline and monobactam\u2014aztreonam, which is similar with the catalytic ability of VIM-4 and NDM-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae [2], [8].",

Then the activity of the mutants for meropenem was measured and the result is shown in Figure 8C. It is obvious that the mutants almost completely lose their activity in antibiotics hydrolysis. This result in turn verified the accuracy of our 3D model in which the Zn2+(II) is coordinated with the conserved residues Asp124 and Cys208, in spite that it is still intriguing whether the effect is structural or functional. However, the decreased catalytic activity implied the mechanism should be Zn2+(II) assisted, supporting the proposal that Zn2+(II) ion is crucial for stabilizing the development of a negative charge on the \u03b2-lactam nitrogen atom(as show in Figure 3). Regarding K211A and K211E mutants, the significantly decreased hydrolysis activity indicated that the electrostatic interaction between the original carboxyl group of hydrolyzed antibiotics and positive-charged side-chain of K211 probably afford one of the driving force for the catalysis. While with respect to loop1 (LDMPGFGAVA), we did the loop displacement with QSFDGAVYP in VIM-2 and VIM-4. Different with the point mutants, the hydrolytic catalysis didn't decrease compared with the wild-type, which means only the loop1 change wouldn't affect the hydrolytic catalysis very much. Moreover, it was reported that A121F, Q123D and A121F/Q123D mutants strongly weakened the imipenem hydrolysis activity of NDM-1, proving the crucial roles of the unique HA(121)HQ(123)D motif compared with HFHDD motif in other MBLs [10].

The newly emergent NDM-1, called \u201csuperbug\u201d, possesses more potent hydrolysis ability toward almost all antibiotics and hence becomes a new threat in clinical surgery. This is one typical example of the remarkable ability of bacteria to adapt and eventually become resistant to new antibiotics. It is made much easier by the existence of plasmids, which can transmit easily from bacterium to bacterium. In this study, the structural models of NDM-1/antibiotics complex were obtained from homology modeling and molecular docking methods. The detailed analysis indicates that the loop1 of more flexibility and hydrophobic, together with the loop2 of more positive-charged, leads to NDM-1 more potent in antibiotics hydrolysis compared with other MBLs. Meanwhile, the experiments proved that NDM-1 was highly resistant to carbapenems and cephalosporins and susceptible to aztreoname and tigecycline, which was firstly implied to slow down the hydrolysis velocity of meropenem by NDM-1 in our study. Moreover, the mutant results displayed the molecular basis for the catalytic mechanism. At present, there are no effective antibiotics against NDM-1 positive pathogen. An appreciated strategy is to identify drug candidates from the existing antibiotics, such as tigecycline, based on the 3D model of NDM-1 by using structure-based virtual screening (e.g., molecular docking and ligand-based, receptor-based and pharmacophore-based drug design) in conjunction with bioassay. This strategy has been used successfully in the discovery of the compound cinanserin against SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) [16]. Taken together, our study provided clues to investigate the molecular basis of extended antibiotics resistance of NDM-1 and shed light upon the discovery of new antibiotics against NDM-1 positive strains in clinical studies.",

The grid-enclosing box was centered on the Zn2+(I) and defined so as to enclose residues located within 10 \u00c5, and a scaling factor of 1.0 was set to van der Waals (VDM) radii of those receptor atoms with the partial atomic charge less than 0.25. In the docking process, extra-precision (XP) docking was adopted to generate the minimized pose, and the Glide scoring function (G-Score) was used to select the final 20 poses for each antibiotic. Together with reported study, the reasonable poses were used for the binding mode analysis.",
