The precise cost of BRD to the industry is not well understood [2], but losses of at least $1 billion annually have been estimated considering costs of prevention, treatment, loss of productivity and labor [3]. Despite BRD being one of the most common and expensive diseases of feedlot cattle, annual morbidity and mortality rates have increased despite the extensive use of vaccines and antimicrobials [4]. BRD is caused by a number of bacterial and viral pathogens which are collectively referred to as the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). This complex includes bovine herpes virus type 1 also known as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bacterial pathogens Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis [5]. However, the onset of disease is usually associated with environmental stressors, a susceptible host and the presence of both viral and bacterial pathogens [4].",

            "text": "Stress resulting from management procedures can predispose calves to an initial infection by a viral pathogen which may suppress the animals\u2019 defense mechanisms, facilitating a secondary infection due to the colonization of the lower respiratory tract by bacteria [6]. While respiratory viruses are capable of causing a clinical disease that is consistent with BRD in the absence of a bacterial co-infection [7], viral infection is usually considered to be the precursor to a secondary bacterial infection which leads to the disease syndrome of BRDC [6,8]. Although the importance of many environmental and management stress factors, such as weaning and transportation are well understood, as is the fact that susceptibility to BRD is lowly to moderately heritable [9], the genetic dissection of the specific loci underlying susceptibility has yet to be tackled. Two approaches are commonly used either individually, or in conjunction, for the dissection of loci underlying phenotypic variation. Genome-wide association analysis is used to identify regions of the genome which harbor variants that have large effects on phenotypic variation and gene expression studies are used to identify transcripts which differ in abundance between individuals which differ in phenotype. When these data are integrated, differentially expressed (DE) genes which reside in genomic regions that have been shown to be trait-associated suggests a direct role for these genes in regulating trait variation [10\u201312].",

These variants may be directly selected in livestock populations to reduce the prevalence of multi-agent diseases such as BRDC. The aim of this research was to compare, relative to controls, the bronchial lymph node transcript levels of steers produced from Angus bulls mated to advanced generation Hereford-Angus crossbred cows that were experimentally challenged with IBR, BVDV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, P. multocida or M. bovis. Bronchial lymph nodes were chosen for analysis because the immune response to pathogens in the lung is important to the host response and these nodes contain lymphocytes that come from the lung. Moreover, these nodes are where antigen presentation occurs and where the T and B cells are stimulated. Consequently, bronchial lymph nodes provide the best window into lymphocyte responses within the infected lung compartment.",

Blood was collected and steers seronegative, or with the lowest titers against each bacterial and viral pathogen, were selected. The six to eight month old steers were transported to the University of California Davis where they were maintained in pens, fed a 65% concentrate starter diet and were provided water ad libitum. The challenge studies were performed sequentially starting with the control animals and with animals housed in groups by control or challenge pathogen.

In addition, two control animals were aerosol administered with 8.5 ml of tissue culture media via a nebulizer and two additional control animals were inoculated by intratracheal instillation with 8.5 ml of phosphate buffered saline. The volume of phosphate buffered saline given by intratracheal inoculation was followed by two volumes of air to make sure that no saline was left in the tube; whereas, the tissue culture media was given by aerosol to mimic one mechanism of viral exposure. One animal challenged with M. bovis was euthanized early due to extreme disease and tissues were not collected, leaving 27 animals with bronchial lymph node tissues available for analysis from the optimized study.

Because these RNA-seq data were from a relatively well-annotated organism, and the number of potential novel isoforms appeared to be very large (68.33% of the identified transcripts; Table 1), we chose to not use the merged assembly file in the downstream Cuffdiff analysis to avoid the potential for bias caused by assembly errors [21]. The large number of potentially new isoforms was expected because most human multi-exon genes are known to undergo alternative splicing [22]. We manually evaluated 100 potentially new isoforms by randomly sampling transcripts within different size ranges and searching the NCBI \u2018nr\u2019 database for these sequences with BLAST and observed that 76% were new isoforms, 8% were likely assembly artifacts, 10% represented incompletely assembled reference genes (i.e., missing exons or possessing larger 3\u2019 or 5\u2019 end sequences) and 6% had retained introns.",

First, the variation between biological replicates was assessed using an MDS plot based on all expressed genes, which revealed a strong clustering of samples from control, bacterially and virally challenged animals with little variation between replicates (Fig 1). The first dimension clearly separated the virus- from the bacteria-challenged and control animals, while the second dimension separated controls from bacteria- and virus-challenged animals and suggests an ordering of pathogenicity. This postulate was also supported by the Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence statistics between the challenged groups estimated from FPKM values for all genes (Fig 2) and by the principal component analysis (PC1 vs PC2; Fig 3), which show that the perturbation of gene expression was greatest for the animals challenged with viruses. The dynamic range of FPKM values was also evaluated by creating a boxplot of log10 transformed FPKM values for each biological replicate (Fig 4). The median FPKM values across the challenge groups were similar and the ranges indicate that our depth of sequence coverage was sufficient to allow the identification of genes with low transcript abundance.",

In particular, the QTL regions from 107\u2013108 Mb on BTA3, 67\u201368 Mb on BTA13, 30\u201331 Mb on BTA15, 72\u201373 Mb on BTA17 and 55\u201356 Mb on BTA18 harbor from 6 to 16 genes that were DE in animals challenged by all pathogens except for M. bovis. The QTL region from 65\u201366 Mb on BTA18 harbors 10 DE genes for which the upstream predicted regulators BCL2-Associated X Protein (BAX) and Protein Phosphatase 1, Regulatory Subunit 15A (PPP1R15A) were located in the syntenic QTL region at 55\u201356 Mb. The 10 genes in this QTL region were found to only be DE in response to challenge by the three viral pathogens.",

However, each pathogen may trigger a specific immune response.

This was consistent with the sampling of steers for the challenge experiment which had either no, or low, blood titers against the challenge pathogens.

PRR ligation stimulates several signaling pathways that result in the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and interferon regulatory factors, which mediate the production of cytokines and type I interferons needed for an effective innate response [28\u201332].

For example, we found the toll-like receptor pathway and MAPK signaling which are responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of kinases which regulate cytokine production [33], TGF-beta signaling, which functions in cytokine regulation [34] and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity whereby populations of lymphocytes are activated to cytotoxicity via the production of cytokines and chemokines [35]. The cytokine and chemokine-related pathways were all up-regulated in the challenged animals. Cytokines and chemokines have important functions in the innate and adaptive immune systems. The production of cytokines by innate immune cells occurs as an acute response to inflammation and infection across diverse etiologies. The release of cytokines and chemokines orchestrates immune responses through communication with other cells. For the immune response to efficiently function, the synthesis and release of cytokines must be controlled [36] and the pathways enriched for DE genes detected in our analyses of these data are involved in this process. It is important to note that cytokines underlying the control of viral immunity differ from those that are most relevant to anti-bacterial defense. For example, an effective immune response to BRSV, IBR and BVDV requires the development of cytotoxic T cells, which are critical for the elimination of virus infected cells. Production of interleukin 12 and interferon gamma by T helper type 1 cells facilitates the priming of CD8 cytotoxic T cells. Whereas, in humoral immunity, antibody production is associated with interleukin 4 expression and interleukin 17 stimulates a neutrophil response in the defense against many bacterial pathogens [37].",

In response to the M. haemolytica challenge, TLR1 and TLR6 are induced while for IBR, TLR2 and TLR4 are induced. TLR2 and TLR4 proteins are present on the surface of immune cells and are known to be involved in the recognition of several viruses via the detection of envelope glycoproteins [38]. The activation of TLRs initiates downstream signaling cascades which regulate intracellular kinases and may stimulate an inflammatory and an antigen-specific immune response. The signaling pathways associated with each TLR differ and may involve different biological responses [39]. Our results suggest that TLR1 and TLR6 mediate the innate immune response to M. haemolytica while TLR2 and TLR4 mediate response to infection by IBR and other viruses.",

Cultures of the upper respiratory tract from the steers revealed the expected common bacterial pathogens. However, culture of lungs from these steers predominantly demonstrated the pathogen that was introduced by experimental challenge. Our selection of the bronchial lymph node for RNA sequencing was based upon the fact that lymphocytes within the node drain the lung and therefore their RNA expression represents a response to pathogens in the lung [55]. Thus, lymphocyte responses to bacterial agents found in the upper respiratory tract, where they normally occur as commensals, were not expected to be observed in transcripts from the bronchial lymph nodes.",

Among these are several key upstream regulators which are predicted to regulate the expression of numerous downstream genes that were DE between challenged and control animals. Polymorphisms within regulatory elements controlling the expression of these genes and their isoforms or within the primary transcripts themselves are strong candidates for the detected QTL. Due to the difference in breeds between this and the GWAS [23] and because animals in this study were randomly assigned to challenge groups without regard to their BRD susceptibility, the transcript variants for the DE genes reported in S14 Table do not inherently provide strong candidates for the causal variants underlying the QTL. Rather, variant detection using genomic DNA from cases and controls drawn from the GWAS population offers the greatest likelihood of identifying the causal variants.",

A set of the 200 most variable of the DE genes was able to partially classify each replicate into its respective challenge group and may be useful for predicting the immunopathogenesis of disease caused by each pathogen and the effects that genetic manipulation might have on disease outcomes. Key upstream regulators were identified which provide possible targets for the development of novel molecular therapies and studies exploring the effects of manipulating their signaling on the modulation of bovine immune function should be considered. One hundred and forty two DE genes, some of which are key upstream regulators were found to be located in previously identified QTL regions associated with risk of BRD. Our analyses of these data provide new insights and perspectives into the genetic basis of BRDC susceptibility and the molecular mechanisms underlying bovine immune responses to respiratory disease which may be useful for the identification of large effect loci underlying differential susceptibility and for the development of new therapeutic intervention strategies.",
