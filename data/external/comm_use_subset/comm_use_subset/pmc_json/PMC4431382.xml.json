            "text": "Emerging pathogens such as Ebolaviruses (EBOV), Avian Influenza viruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, Middle-East coronavirus (MERS), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus pose public health challenges that demand researchers and governments work together to assess their pandemic potential and plan mitigating strategies. Of the five species of EBOV belonging to the\nFiloviridae (including\nZaire ebolavirus (EBOV-Z),\nBundibugyo ebolavirus (EBOV-B),\nReston ebolavirus,\nSudan ebolavirus (EBOV-S) and\nTai Forest ebolavirus\n1), EBOV-Z and EBOV-S are responsible for the majority of outbreaks of highly pathogenic haemorrhagic fevers causing high fatality rates\n2. Past outbreaks have been of limited size affecting a local population, however a strain of EBOV-Z is the causative agent of the current outbreak that began in late 2013 and has since become an unprecedented and devastating epidemic\n3,\n4, resulting in over 20,000 suspected cases, of which those confirmed had a case fatality rate of around 60% in the afflicted West African countries (\nhttp://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-20150107?lang=en and\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/). Towards the end of 2014 the trend in case numbers reversed in Liberia and the epidemic slowed in Sierra Leone and Guinea, but the virus continues to transit in new geographical areas\n5. This epidemic has triggered a significant global health response relying on primary hygiene and other containment measures that have proved successful in limiting the spread of the virus in previous outbreaks. Given the scale of this outbreak and the fear that traditional containment measures may fail to prevent global spread, several vaccines have been fast-tracked into phase I clinical trials\n6\u2013\n8 although even if proved efficacious, the limited supply of sufficient quantities of vaccine will hinder their use in the current situation. For disease treatment, patients suffering a haemorrhagic fever have relied on the clinical management of symptoms (\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/treatment/), with a handful of patients in this outbreak receiving experimental therapies such as ZMapp, TKM-Ebola, brincidofovir and favipiravir (\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/ebola-trials-to-start-in-december-1.16342)\n9\u2013\n12. Alternatively antibody treatment by transfusion therapy using blood or plasma from Ebola virus survivors has been approved\n11,\n13\u2013\n16; although issues with safety and lack of resources for this method limit its suitability in West Africa today. Having no approved or widely available therapeutics for EBOV, as with many other emerging viral diseases, focus has turned to possible re-purposing of drugs already licensed for other uses by the EMA and FDA. Several clinically approved drugs have been identified by researchers\n17\u2013\n20, including amiodarone, one of the several cationic amphiphiles found to inhibit filovirus entry which is currently being trialled in Sierra Leone\n21. However reservations have been expressed about the complications that could be caused by side effects of the drug in EBOV patients. The anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ) has also been shown to inhibit EBOV entry and protected mice from EBOV infection\n18,\n22 and has been previously highlighted as a possible drug to treat EBOV infection\n11.",

Therefore it is important to try and understand the mechanism of virus inhibition by such drugs. To this end we re-examined the anti-viral properties of CQ, and show here that it inhibited the pH-dependent endosomal entry of a pseudotyped virus (PV) bearing EBOV glycoproteins, in the same way as did the potent and specific vacuolar-ATPase (vATPase) inhibitor bafilyomycin A1 (BafA1) (a non-medical laboratory compound). We also show that licensed and widely used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for treatment of gastric acid reflux, omeprazole (OM) and esomeprazole (ESOM), inhibited PV EBOV entry, likely by their off-target inhibitory activity on endosomal vATPase.",

In one study BafA1 treated mice were not protected from influenza infection but treatment with a related compound, SaliPhe, was protective, even though both drugs were potent\nin vitro\n43. Inhibition of endosome acidification as a target for inhibiting EBOV can be justified by the knowledge that the filoviruses depend on the low pH for two separate steps of their entry pathway. Not only is the fusion by G protein triggered by low pH, but its cleavage into a fusogenic form is carried out by endosomal enzymes cathepsins B and L whose activation is also pH dependent\n44. Some have argued that G protein cleavage by cathepsin is less essential than previously thought\n45,\n46 and that EBOV species other than Zaire together with closely related MARV do not require cathepsin cleavage for entry\n47,\n48.

Interestingly, compounds belonging to the omeprazole family have also been described as having anti-malarial properties\nin vitro, possibly via their reported ability to target vATPase in the plasma membrane of Plasmodium parasite\n54. Soon after its discovery OM was found to also inhibit intracellular vATPase at \u00b5M concentrations as opposed to its licensed target of gastric H+/K+-ATPase against which it is effective at much lower concentrations\n32,\n33. Indeed there are a plethora of publications indicating use of OM and ESOM in cancer therapy, as a means to inhibit the characteristic acidic intracellular environment, and thus permit sensitivity to cytotoxic therapies\n55\u2013\n59. A role of OM and ESOM has also been noted in the suppression of bone resorption, another physiological process dependent on pH\n60\u2013\n62. Given the volume of research suggesting these off target effects depend on an ability to affect intracellular pH, we hypothesised that these drugs would, like CQ and BafA1, inhibit EBOV, MARV and influenza virus pH dependent entry. We used GALV as a control again since its entry is reportedly independent of pH. Indeed, EBOV, FLU-H5 and MARV were inhibited by lower doses of OM or ESOM than GALV (\nFigure 1 and\nTable 1). GALV entry was also inhibited at the highest concentration, but we cannot exclude that this was due to a toxic effect that was not measured by the\nRenilla control we employed here. We did not observe as close a correlation between drug doses that mediated the inhibition of EBOV or influenza PV entry and increase in pH of intracellular vesicles for OM and ESOM as for CQ and BafA, (\nFigure 1 and\nFigure 2). More recently, it has been reported that OM and ESOM altered the localisation of vATPase in the cell as well as the pH of intracellular vesicles\n46 and this may explain their ability to inhibit PV entry more potently than the pH changes we observed would suggest.",

Some epidemiological evidence from population studies suggests that OM could exert a protective effect against influenza-like-illness\n64, but our studies suggest that doses required for potent inhibition might be difficult to achieve without significant toxicity. Despite these drugs being readily available, even without prescription in some countries, the licensed dosing would generate a plasma concentration reportedly 1.59\u20139.61\u00b5M for ESOM that falls short of the IC\n50 calculated in this study, although higher doses have been used clinically\n65. Therefore it seems unlikely that OM and ESOM would be a suitable therapy for ebolavirus infection, but more specifically designed vATPase inhibitors may have potential as broad acting antivirals against several emerging viruses in the future. With regard to CQ, the evidence suggests a more promising position for use against ebolavirus. Standard adult dosing (25mg/kg) achieves plasma concentration of 2\u00b5M, close to our IC\n50 value against EBOV PV entry. Protection in the mouse model was previously shown with a 90mg/kg dosage\n18,\n66.",

In Ebola patients with severe life-threatening disease it would be important to ensure that any side effects of a therapy did not enhance disease progression, particularly if higher doses of re-purposed drugs, as suggested here, were considered. On the other hand, CQ has been taken prophylactically in a tropical setting for many years to prevent malaria and we suggest that, with little additional need for scale up of production of a new agent, this might represent a useful adjunct to the current antiviral strategies being trialled in West Africa. We envisage that in contacts of EBOV cases, CQ might decrease the viral load that establishes in the early days after virus transmission. Further work in\nin vivo models including guinea pig and primates should inform about doses and administration regimens.",
