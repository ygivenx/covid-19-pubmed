The accurate description of contact patterns between individuals is crucial to this end, as it can help to understand the possible transmission dynamics and the design principles for appropriate control measures. In particular, the mutual exposures between patients and health-care workers (HCWs) have been documented for bacterial and viral transmission since decades [1], [2], [3]. Transmission might be the result of effective contact, as in the cases of S. aureus\n[4], [5], K. pneumoniae\n[6] or rotavirus [7], of exposure to contaminated aerosols, as for M. tuberculosis\n[8], or the result of exposure to droplets, as for influenza [9]. Some pathogens such as influenza can also be transmitted by different routes. Although close-range proximity and contacts between individuals are strong determinants for potential transmissions, obtaining reliable data on these behaviors remains a challenge [10].",

These approaches provide essential information to describe contacts patterns and inform models of infectious disease spread. The gathered data, however, often lack the longitudinal dimension [10], [12], [16] and the high spatial and temporal resolution needed to accurately characterize the interactions among individuals in specific environments such as hospitals. Moreover, they are subject to potential biases due to behavioral modifications due to the presence of observers, to short periods of observation, and especially to missing information and recall biases. Evaluating biases and understanding the accuracy of the collected data is therefore a difficult task [16].",

The power level is tuned so that devices can exchange packets only when located within 1\u20131.5 meters of one another, i.e., package exchange is used as a proxy for distance (the tags do not directly measure distances). Individuals were asked to wear the devices on their chests using lanyards, ensuring that the RFID devices of two individuals can only exchange radio packets when the persons are facing each other, as the human body acts as a RF shield at the frequency used for communication. In summary the system is tuned so that it detects and records close-range encounters during which a communicable disease infection could be transmitted, for example, by cough, sneeze or hand contact. The information on face-to-face proximity events detected by the wearable sensors is relayed to radio receivers installed throughout the hospital ward (bedrooms, offices and hall).",

We therefore define two individuals to be in \u201ccontact\u201d during a 20-second interval if and only if their sensors exchanged at least one packet during that interval. A contact is therefore symmetric by definition, and in case of contacts involving three or more individuals in the same 20-second interval, all the contact pairs were considered. After the contact is established, it is considered ongoing as long as the devices continue to exchange at least one packet for every subsequent 20 s interval. Conversely, a contact is considered broken if a 20-second interval elapses with no exchange of packets. We emphasize that this is an operational definition of the human proximity behavior that we choose to quantify, and that all the results we present correspond to this precise and specific definition of \u201ccontact\u201d.

Models of transmission within hospitals might be based on contact matrices such as those presented here, and used to better understand the epidemiology of different types of microbial agents, to assess the impact of control measures, and to help improve the delivery of care during emergency epidemic situations. In our study, specific mixing patterns were observed between different classes of individuals, showing a clear departure from homogeneous mixing, as it is expected in a hospital setting, and highlighting the relevance of correctly informed contact matrices. Moreover, although an important turnover between the persons in contact with a given individual was observed across different days, and although the average contact durations between different classes of individuals varied between mornings, afternoons and nights, the contact patterns remained statistically very similar across successive days. These results suggest that, in order to correctly inform computational models, data collected over just a few hours might be insufficient, but that measures lasting 48 hours would be sufficient to evaluate the statistical properties of contact patterns as well as the mixing patterns between individual classes, and to estimate the similarity between the contacts of an individual across days. The statistical features of the gathered data could then be used to model contact patterns over longer time scales.",
