            "text": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the incidence of related complications like diabetic nephropathy have increased dramatically worldwide. This pandemic of diabetes is expected to escalate further as the population ages and obesity rates continue to soar. As the most common medical complications of diabetes include a range of progressive, chronic, renal, and cardiovascular problems, there is a great need for clinical tools that would enable the prevention and early diagnosis of such complications. Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes, and a leading cause of end-stage renal disease indicating a failure of current available preventive therapeutic strategies. Microalbuminuria, defined as a urinary albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg/day, is a commonly considered clinical sign of renal dysfunction and an early predictor of diabetic nephropathy [1]. Despite therapeutic intervention, kidney function progressively worsens in many diabetic patients underscoring the importance of novel and disease-specific biomarkers. The renal renin angiotensin system (RAS), specifically angiotensin II (Ang II), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy [2]. Ang II and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are activated in type 2 diabetes [3], and are involved in the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes such as nephropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular disease [4]. In addition to glycemia control, lowering blood pressure as well as therapeutic approaches aimed at blocking the RAS, are strategies known to improve symptoms of diabetic nephropathy and preserve renal function in individuals with chronic disease due to different causes [5].",

ACE2 plays an integral role in the protection against renal damage and cardiovascular disease [8]\u2013[10]. Administration of ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760) increases albuminuria, mesangial pathologies and fibronectin deposition in diabetic mice [11], [12]. ACE2 delivery in form of recombinant protein or virus ameliorates the progression of diabetes-related complications, such as nephropathy and retinopathy [13]\u2013[15]. In addition, urinary ACE2 is elevated in patients with diabetic nephropathy, renal disease, or renal transplant suggesting a possible role of urinary ACE2 as a non-invasive disease biomarker [16]\u2013[18]. A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17, also known as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE), is involved in the ectodomain shedding of several membrane bound proteins [19]\u2013[21]. This includes ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of ACE2 in human embryonic kidney cells and airway epithelial cells [22], [23]. Loss of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), an endogenous inhibitor of ADAM17, has been shown to exacerbate diabetic nephropathy [24].",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that thiazolidinediones (TZDs) exhibit renoprotective effects. TZDs are synthetic ligands with high affinity toward the \u03b3 isoform of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR\u03b3). TZDs used to be among the first line choice medications to control hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients [25]. Although TZDs are very effective in glycemic control, meta-analysis suggests that they can also increase the risk of macrovascular complications [26]. For this reason, the use of TZDs is restricted in the United States in favor of less aggressive treatment options. Clinical studies revealed that chronic treatment with the TZD rosiglitazone markedly reduced urinary albumin excretion in type 2 diabetic patients [27], [28]. In addition, TZDs modulate the RAS, in particular ACE [29], Ang II receptors [30], Ang I and Ang II levels [31]. However, the effect of TZD\u2019s on ACE2 has not been investigated before.Our central hypothesis is that renal ACE2 is upregulated to combat the detrimental effects of enhanced Ang II during early stages of diabetic kidney damage. Ang II is known to activate and redistribute ADAM17 [32], causing ACE2 to be shed from the renal tubules into urine. This loss of renal ACE2 function leads to increased renal injury, which can be reversed by anti-diabetic medication with rosiglitazone resulting in reduced renal ADAM17 expression and consequently, decreased urinary ACE2 levels and improved renal ACE2 function.",

This urinary ACE2 excretion correlated positively with the progression of diabetic renal injury represented by progressive albuminuria, mesangial matrix expansion and renal fibrosis. Overactivation of the RAS in diabetes, especially Ang II and ACE [3], leads to hypertension, fluid retention, and inflammation, causing renal and vascular end-stage disease in the long term [35]. Ang II plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic renal disease by affecting intraglomerular capillary pressure, the podocyte skeleton, and components of the slit diaphragm leading to glomerular sclerosis and microalbuminuria [36]. There is evidence that deletion of ACE2 leads to the development of Ang II dependent renal damage, suggesting ACE2 as renoprotective target in diabetes [37]. The ability of ACE2 to inactivate Ang II and generate the putative reno- and cardio-protective metabolite, Ang-(1\u20137), suggests that ACE2 is an important participant in cardiovascular homeostasis [38], [39]. Indeed, we found an activation of renal ACE2 in db/db mice, most likely a part of a mechanism to compensate for elevated Ang II levels. Moreover, our results demonstrated that ADAM17, a protease known to be involved in the ectodomain shedding of several integral proteins, including ACE2 but not ACE [40], was significantly upregulated in the kidneys of db/db mice. Accordingly, treatment with Ang II results in enhanced accumulation of renal ADAM17 [32]. This study is also the first report showing upregulation of renal ADAM17 in db/db mice. Moreover, renal TIMP3 expression was significantly reduced, supporting earlier findings that the loss of endogenous ADAM17 inhibitor exacerbates diabetic nephropathy [24]. Based on these data, we postulate that during early stages of kidney damage, renal ACE2 and sheddase activity of ADAM17 increase in the event of high circulating Ang II, while expression of renal TIMP3 is reduced. In consensus with our hypothesis, immunostaining results demonstrated that ADAM17 colocalized with tubular ACE2 in diabetic kidney. Consequently, due to the actions of ADAM17, proteolytically active forms of ACE2 from the kidney are shed into urine of db/db diabetic mice. Thus, the loss of renoprotective enzyme ACE2 could contribute to kidney damage.",

Hyperglycemia leads to nephropathy by various mechanisms, such as increased endothelial cell permeability to albumin, hypertrophy and thickening of the basement membrane. We observed a decrease in a slit diaphragm associated protein, nephrin, from the glomeruli of db/db mice. We hypothesize that loss of nephrin from the slit pore may result in the enhanced passage of albumin into urine, which is consistent with previous studies [42]. At five weeks of age, db/db mice exhibited hyperglycemia, as well as microalbuminuria. Our previous studies demonstrated that blood pressure in db/db mice starts to rise after eleven weeks of age [3]. Therefore, we propose that kidney damage in db/db mice is initially triggered by hyperglycemia. With increasing age, disease progresses and kidney function deteriorates further, resulting in a significant rise in albuminuria, mesangial expansion, and renal fibrosis.",

            "text": "Retrospective clinical studies suggest that strict control of hyperglycemia depreciates the progression of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular complications [43]. To this end, we explored the effect of normalizing glycemia by rosiglitazone on kidney function, renal ACE2 shedding, ADAM17 and TIMP3 expression in db/db mice. We observed after only one week of treatment of db/db mice a significant decline in blood glucose levels to normal levels, which was associated with decreased urinary albumin and an attenuation of renal pathologies at the end of the study period. These findings clearly demonstrate the significance of glycemic control in preventing diabetic renal injury. Treatment with rosiglitazone attenuated urinary ACE2 protein excretion and activity but had no effect on renal ACE2 in treated db/db mice compared to untreated db/db mice. Unchanged levels of renoprotective tubular ACE2 might complement the positive effects of treatment with rosiglitazone in the diabetic kidney. In addition, rosiglitazone markedly attenuated renal ADAM17 in db/db mice. Thus, rosiglitazone treatment may impart renoprotection via attenuated shedding of ACE2, possibly through its direct influence on ADAM17. Interestingly, treatment with rosiglitazone had no effect on TIMP3 suggesting that hyperglycemia has no control over TIMP3.In addition to the conventional fluorogenic assay, urinary ACE2 activity was further verified by MS, which is known for its high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy [34], [44]. In agreement with the Western blot results, both enzymatic test systems confirmed that urinary ACE2 activity increased significantly in db/db mice compared to lean controls. In contrast, rosiglitazone treatment significantly attenuated urinary ACE2 activity in db/db mice. Moreover, plasma ACE levels were significantly reduced in treated db/db mice, supporting the hypothesis that the renoprotective effects of rosiglitazone could be partly mediated by its influence on the RAS. To investigate the source of ACE2 in urine, we measured ACE2 activity in plasma and kidney of db/db mice. ACE2 activity has previously been observed in sheep serum [45] and plasma of diabetic rodent models [15], [46]. However, plasma ACE2 activity was not detectable in normal and healthy subjects [47]. In turn, the latter attributed this effect to the presence of endogenous ACE2 inhibitor. Another study showed an elevation in serum ACE2 activity of type 1 diabetic patients with macro- and microvascular complications [48]. Reasons behind this disparity might be differences in species, type of substrate used, incubation time (up to 24 hours) or the method adopted. Concurrent with our previous findings [34], we found that there is neither detectable plasma ACE2 activity in control nor db/db mice, but there is significantly elevated ACE2 activity in the kidneys of db/db mice. In addition, clinical data from CKD and diabetic renal transplant patients [17], [18] also support our conclusion that the kidney, not plasma, is the source of urinary ACE2. Thus, urinary ACE2 could be a promising non-invasive biomarker for assessing renal function in diabetic pathologies.",

Although blood pressure control was effective for preventing onset and progression of microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients, it did not prevent the development of end stage renal disease, as shown in the ADVANCE trial [49]. Therefore, there is a need for more sensitive and specific urinary markers to early and reliably predict kidney disease. Previous studies in humans suggested RAS components, such as urinary angiotensinogen, for the determination of kidney disease in diabetic as well as CKD patients [50], [51]. In rodent models of CKD, pathophysiological changes were associated with an increased overexpression of urinary ACE suggesting that this enzyme could be used as a biological urinary marker in CKD [52]. Moreover, ACE was found in human urine and associated with hypertension [53]. We propose that urinary ACE2 can be used as a potential marker of diabetic nephropathy. Our results show that urinary ACE2 activity is elevated in db/db mice compared to control mice and persistently increased throughout the study period of eight wks. Excretion of urinary albumin followed the same trend and a strong positive correlation was observed between urinary ACE2 activity and albumin excretion among the groups throughout the experiment. These finding are consistent with a recent study comparing urinary ACE2 and albumin excretion in human patients [54]. Interestingly, plasma abnormalities (glucose, glucagon and triglycerides) seen in db/db mice demonstrated a significant positive correlation with urinary ACE2. Correlation between urinary ACE2 excretion and well-established plasma risk factors of diabetes, such as triglycerides and glucagon, suggest urinary ACE2 as a novel surrogate marker for diabetes. Based on these results, it is tempting to hypothesize that urinary ACE2 is an independent risk factor for predicting early onset of diabetes and its related complications in high-risk patients.",
