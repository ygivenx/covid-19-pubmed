Serious H5N1 outbreaks in poultry accompanied by human casualties soon followed in Hong Kong in 1997 [2]. In 2002, outbreaks reemerged in both terrestrial poultry and wild waterfowl [3]. In late 2003, an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in poultry was confirmed for the first time in South Korea. This was followed by eruptions in Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, China, Laos, and Indonesia at the beginning of 2004 [4]. By 2006, H5N1 HPAIV, the so-called Qinghai strain, had spread throughout Central and Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa [5].",

            "text": "The H5N1 virus is endemic in poultry and has caused occasional infections in mammals. It poses a severe threat to the poultry industry in Southeast Asia and Africa. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the highly pathogenic manifestation of the H5N1 viruses in chickens has not been fully elucidated. Viruses like influenza are continually exposed to host immune systems, and their pathogenicity is thought to be related to viral replication, which either overwhelms the host immune system or causes it to malfunction. Various viral factors have been shown to be related to differences in pathogenicity. Specific amino acid substitutions in PB2 [6,7], PB1 [8,9], PB1-F2 [10], PA-X [11], NP [12], M1 [13], and NS1 [6,14] are correlated with viral replication or alterations in the host cytokine response against viral infection. Differences in HPAIV pathogenicity may also depend on the susceptibility of the host. Differences in the lethality of HPAIV infection among various lines or breeds of chicken have been described [15,16]. The host innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens are related to the genetic background of the host. Mx protein, which is induced by type I interferon and is encoded by the Mx1 gene [17], was reported to display intrinsic antiviral activity, and is associated with resistance to influenza virus infection in mammals [18]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that a substitution in the Mx protein (S631N) is associated with resistance to avian influenza virus infection in chickens [19,20]. However, some in vivo and in vitro studies have failed to demonstrate this association [15,21,22]. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype is another candidate host resistant factor. In chicken, virtually all cells express MHC class I molecules, and they are thought to play a central role in MHC-restricted antigen presentation to cytotoxic T cells [23,24]. Studies suggest that chicken MHC haplotypes are associated with resistance or susceptibility to infectious diseases [24,25]. In a previous study, some Thai indigenous chickens were reported to have survived the H5N1 outbreaks during 2004\u20132005, and the B21 haplotype was suggested to be associated with the resistance to H5N1 infection [16]. However, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the differences in susceptibility among the various breeds of Thai indigenous chickens. The identification of a genetic factor affecting the resistance/susceptibility to HPAIV would aid in the elucidation of the mechanism underlying pathogenesis.",

The HA sequence of pigeon-04 was classified as clade 1 (WHO/OIE/FAO/H5N1 Evolution Working Group 2007) [26]. Virus stocks were propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and the culture supernatant was harvested and stored at -80\u00b0C. The viral infectivity of each strain was determined by serial titration in 10\u201311-day-old embryonated eggs, and was expressed as 50% of the egg infective dose (EID50)/mL using the method reported by Reed and Muench [27]. The complete coding sequences of the gene segments were determined, and phylogenetic analyses were performed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA5 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) [28].",

Crane-05, openbill-6-04, and openbill-1640 showed 100% lethality at 104EID50; however, the MDT of openbill-1640 was extended compared to that of the other viruses, and the infected chickens displayed variable clinical symptoms. Viral shedding in the trachea of dead chickens was significantly higher in openbill-1640 than in other H5N1 isolates (Fig 1C), while that in cloaca was significantly lower (Fig 1D). In HPAIVs, the virus shedding patterns have been reported to be varied in the different isolates [33]. Because viral titers in organs of chicken infected with openbill-1604 at 24 h after inoculation were also lower than other viruses (Fig 2), this might result in the lower titer shedding from cloaca.",

These observed differences in virus pathogenicity could be due to slight differences in the viral genomes. Pigeon-04 possess several unique amino acid substitutions, at positions 451 of PB2, 106 of PB1, 74 and 75 of PB1-F2, 584 of PA, and 492 of NP. Openbill-6-04 possessed dual amino acid substitutions at positions 627 and 701 in the PB2 genes, which affects polymerase activity in chickens and mice [6,7]. This strain also possessed the other many unique substitutions at 643, 644 and 752 of PB1, 11 and 192 of PA, 59, 152, 231, 451 and 518 of HA, 111, 146 and 266 of NA, 86 of M2, 76, 147 and 166 of NS1, and 14 of NS2. Among these substitutions, the nucleotide sequences at 192 codon of PA were UGU in openbill-6-04, and CGU in the other isolates. CGU is a rare codon that stimulates the ribosomal +1 frameshifting, resulting in the PA-X expression [34,35]. Substitution from CGU to UGU that exhibits higher codon usage frequency may affect PA-X expression, resulting in alteration of virulence governed by this protein [34\u201337], although relationship between frameshift efficay and codon usage remained to be elucidated [35]. The one or a combination of these other amino acid differences may affect viral replication and pathogenicity in chickens. Further evaluation of these substitutions using reverse genetics techniques to construct individual mutants is required to determine the contribution of each substitution to pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Type 1 interferon exerts an antiviral effect through activation of innate immune cells such as macrophages and NK cells. A previous study showed that A/Vietnam/1203/2003 (H5N1) induced strong inflammatory and Th1-associated cytokines in multiple organs of chickens [38]. Another study showed that a highly virulent H5N1 virus induced antiviral (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and proinflammatory (IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-15) cytokine mRNA expression in the lung at 24 h post infection, which abruptly decreased within the next 8 h [39]. Kuchipudi et al., also reported the highly elevated immune and proinflammatory response following H5N1 HPAIV infection in chicken cells, and that the response is mediated in part by the inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) [40]. The enhanced pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAIV in chickens may be associated with the extremely rapid replication of the virus in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells, which disrupts the innate immune response [39,40]. In our study of chickens inoculated with three viruses, interferon expression in the lungs was not upregulated at 24 h after inoculation, even though the interferon-stimulated genes OASL and Mx (Fig 2) were upregulated. This suggests that peak interferon expression might have occurred at an earlier time point. In contrast, at 24 h post inoculation, the expression of these cytokines was slightly elevated in the brain and spleen. Although the changes in each tissue were not evaluated as a time course, we hypothesize that the timing of cytokine upregulation in the lung, brain, and spleen may differ. A comparison of the cytokine responses among chickens inoculated with the three different viruses showed that IL-6 expression in the lungs and spleen was significantly lower in chickens infected with openbill-1604 than in chickens infected with the other viruses. As openbill-1604-infected chickens showed lower viral loads, the difference observed in cytokine levels might be associated with the differences in viral multiplication. On the other hand, although pigeon-04 showed the least mortality at a dose of 104EID50, virus multiplication and IL-6 expression in organs were similar to crane-05 that showed the highest mortality (Fig 3). Some other host factors as well as viral genomic factors described above, might affect the differences. For understanding why there was a pathogenicity difference where virus titers were not appreciably different, a global gene expression analysis, such as microarray or RNA sequences, may reveal such host factors that are differentially regulated in chicken infected with the different strains.",

            "text": "The commercial breed of chicken used in this study, White Leghorn, appeared to be more sensitive to HPAIV than the Thai indigenous breeds. Differences in sensitivity among breeds of chickens have been reported for other diseases, such as Marek\u2019s disease [41], and Sironi et al. reported variable responses of different chicken lines to HPAIV infection [15]. In addition, Kalaya et al. reported that some Thai indigenous chickens displayed resistant traits during the H5N1 outbreak in 2003\u20132004 [16]. In our study, we demonstrated that White Leghorns appeared to be more sensitive to pigion-04 infection than the Chee, Dang, and LHK lines of Thai indigenous chickens, as evaluated by the MDT and virus shedding. Based on the results of a microsatellite analysis, Thai indigenous chickens are believed to be closely related to original domesticated chickens [42]. Due to the genetic diversity displayed by the indigenous chicken population, they are expected to present unique genotypes and traits. Mx proteins confer resistance to different viral families, and the antiviral activity of Mx gene products has been described in several vertebrate species [43,44]. Mx gene expression is induced by interferon [45]. The Mx gene product has been suggested to be a major component of resistance to influenza virus in mice [46,47], and a serine to asparagine substitution at position 631 is thought to confer antiviral activity [19]. However, in some in vivo studies, no association has been found between the Mx genotype at position 631 and the response of chickens towards H5N1 and H7N1 HPAIV infection [15,48]. In a previous in vitro study, asparagine 631 allele of chicken Mx did not inhibit influenza virus replication [22]. Likewise in the present study, no statistical association was found between the Mx genotype at residue 631 and the survival time after inoculation with HPAIV. Although no association with resistance to HPAIV infection was found, we identified 13 other polymorphic residues in the Mx gene. Four polymorphisms (Mx31, 94, 171, and 552) were newly discovered in this study, and nine others were previously found in different Japanese and Egyptian indigenous chickens [19]. Among these polymorphisms, 10 displayed significantly different frequencies among the chicken breeds (S2 Table).",

            "text": "Some MHC alleles have been shown to confer resistance against virus infection, and in this study, we identified 24 and 26 alleles of BF1 and BF2, respectively, in Thai indigenous chicken lines and White Leghorns. Of these, 15 putative BF1 loci, 16 BF2 loci, and the \u03b11 and \u03b12-coding sequences appear to be novel. The chickens used in this study were native breeds, and high variability in the BF loci and novel alleles were observed. Previous studies have reported that the MHC-B21 haplotype was associated with resistance to H5N1 virus infection, with a 100% survival rate. In contrast, chicken with the MHC-B13 haplotype showed 100% mortality during HPAI outbreaks in Thailand [16]. The MHC-B21 haplotype is also associated with lower tumor-related mortality due to Marek\u2019s herpes virus infection than other haplotypes [49]. In this study, BF2*WL1 and BF1*WL1 showed 100% homology to the MHC-BF21 haplotype reported in a previous study [41]. However, there did not appear to be an association between these alleles and sensitivity to HPAI infection in our study. Hunt et al. performed an experiment using a series of MHC congenic White Leghorn chicken lines (B2, B12, B13, B19, and B21), and reported that none of the lines were completely resistant to a lethal challenge, as evidenced by mortality rates ranging from 40\u2013100% [50]. In our study, although the Thai indigenous chickens had variable BF alleles, whether a specific BF allele was related to resistance against HPAIV could not be determined. Non-MHC immune-related genes, for example dsRNA dependent protein kinase (PKR) [51,52], 2\u2019, 5\u2019-Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [53], and Smad7 [54], and/or a combination of such genes with particular MHC alleles may contribute to the sensitivity of chickens to HPAIV infection. More global genetic analysis on immune related genes, using next generation sequencing technologies would be help to the elucidation.",

Because of the constraints regarding laboratory setting in the BSL-3 facility, we were not able to perform kinetic analysis of the viral replication in inoculated chickens, such analysis would deepen our understanding on the viral replication of those isolates in vivo. Also, scrutiny on transmission ability of those isolates in chickens would have provided further insights in pathogenicity of those isolates, as one of the isolates, pheasant-04, showed longer survival time than the crane-05 while there were no appreciable differences in the virus shedding in the cloaca. Beyond such constrains, we demonstrated that one strain of H5N1 HPAIV, pigeon-04, induced an extended MDT in Thai indigenous chickens. Although we could not identify the host factor associated with increased resistance to HPAIV, the genetic diversity of Thai indigenous chickens may be useful tool for determining the host defense mechanism against HPAIV through extensive genetic analyses.",
