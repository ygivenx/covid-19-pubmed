            "text": "One memorable event was the worldwide movement of young people for the climate. Even if not directly related to infectious disease prevention and control, it reminded us of our collective obligation to the upcoming generations. Disease prevention is about improving future health outcomes. Continuous vigilance and surveillance are necessary elements in ensuring the best possible protection of the heath of the population as a whole. Pathogens continue to evolve in their ability to cause human disease. This was demonstrated by the recent detection of pneumonia cases of unknown origin in Wuhan, China since mid-December, for which an unknown, novel corona virus has been preliminarily determined as the cause [1,2]. An example of how pathogens are able to escape tools and technologies developed to control and stop their spread is antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR has been a worldwide concern for some time already and has featured prominently in Eurosurveillance. In 2019, we covered various aspects of AMR such as the emergence of multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae related to international travel [3], an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a German hospital [4], and the surveillance of antimicrobial consumption and prescribing for example in Belgium, Israel and Switzerland [5-7]. Another aspect driving spread and severity of communicable diseases is human behaviour. The continued spread of measles in Europe over the past decade has been facilitated by insufficient vaccine coverage in specific population groups or regions. Over the past year, vaccine hesitancy and mandatory vaccination were covered in several Eurosurveillance articles [8] as were interventions to improve confidence in vaccines, for example, motivational interviews conducted with parents of newborns on maternity wards in Canada resulted in lower hesitancy and greater intention to vaccinate [9].",

As a reflection of the European focus of Eurosurveillance, the vast majority of published articles were from Europe, even though 15% of accepted articles in 2019 were from non-European countries. We will continue to welcome contributions from around the globe that are relevant for public health in Europe in the year ahead. Our rapid communications on ongoing or emerging threats were published within 2 to 3 weeks of submission, creating awareness and providing evidence to support rapid public health action. Some examples of the rapids we published included the worsening epidemiological situation of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Europe [13], a case of extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever imported from Pakistan to Denmark [14] and the detection of a Chlamydia trachomatis variant escaping detection by a widely used assay in Finland that was found in other European countries thereafter [15-17].",

The 2019 seminar about Point-of-care testing (POCT) and its impact on surveillance of communicable diseases and public health was well received and we look forward to publishing a respective special issue sometime in early spring. The call for the next special issue on Food as a vehicle for AMR will be launched in the second half of 2020. Other 2019 activities by the Eurosurveillance editors comprised several workshops on publication ethics, tools to increase transparency in scholarly communications, and on how authors can improve their chances of getting published. Last but not least, we started to post educational article-related quizzes on Twitter.",

We also value the contributions of our reviewers who go the extra mile, often on short notice and in their spare time, to help us select the right articles and guide authors in how they can improve their manuscripts. We are indebted to each of them. To acknowledge the ca 550 experts who reviewed for us in 2019, we are publishing a list with their names in this issue [18] and sent certificates to all those who supported us with more than one review.",

To get a better idea of the various needs and interests, we launch a satisfaction survey today. The results should inform our strategy by identifying areas of particular interest to our audience.
