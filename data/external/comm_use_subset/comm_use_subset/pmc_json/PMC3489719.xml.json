Ideally, vaccines against pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which infects the airways should elicit immune responses in the mucosa of the respiratory tract [3]. Although mucosal application of vaccines is attractive for many reasons, only few mucosal vaccines [most of them are given by the oral route and only one intranasal (i.n.) live-attenuated influenza vaccine] have been approved for use in humans. Because oral administration of vaccines has been proven difficult for inducing immune responses in the respiratory tract [2], i.n. delivery of vaccines has been selected as an attractive alternative to injection. While i.n. vaccination elicits strong local and systemic immune responses, concerns about its safety have been raised following reports of unacceptable neurological side-effects associated with retrograde transport of antigens or adjuvants through the olfactory epithelium [4-7].",

Two weeks after the third immunization sera were collected and analyzed for SARS-CoV neutralization using microneutralization assay. As shown in Figure 3, all immunization routes induced significant levels of nAbs. The endpoint titers of nAbs are far above the titer of 1/35 that is considered to be protective in mice [36]. Thus, the results demonstrate that s.l. immunization with rADV-S induced high titer of nAbs against SARS-CoV infection, presumably protection against infection with SARS.",

Ten days after the third vaccination, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells binding to MHC I tetramers containing the H-2Kd-restricted SARS-CoV S epitope366-374 (CYGVSATKL) [43] and producing intracellular IFN-\u03b3 after in vitro re-stimulation with CYGVSATKL peptide were determined. As shown in Figure 4A, i.n. and s.l. immunization routes induced significantly higher percentages of SARS S-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs (6.7 and 6.4%, respectively) as compared to i.m route (3.2%). Similarly, i.n. and s.l. immunization routes induced significantly higher percentages of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells in the lung (10.5 and 8.5%, respectively) in response to SARS S protein. As expected, i.n. and s.l. immunization routes induced lower percentages of SARS S-specific CD8+ T cell and IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cell in the spleens (Figure 4B) as compared to that induced by i.m. immunization. The results clearly demonstrate that s.l. and i.n. administrations of rADV-S are equally efficient in induction of CD8+ T cell responses in the lungs.",

The results are in the line of our previous studies and those of others indicating that s.l. immunization induced broad spectrum of specific immune responses [30,31]. Indeed, s.l. immunization induced immune responses in respiratory [30] and vaginal tracts [44-46]. The former is not exceptional for our ADV encoding SARS-CoV since the rADV-S induced significant immune responses in respiratory tracts and systemic compartments. It is noteworthy that protein S specific IgA Ab response in BAL could be only induced when the animals were immunized either intranasally or sublingually. This characteristic of rADV is particularly important for the development of mucosal vaccines against respiratory pathogens. The levels of IgG and IgA induced in the blood upon s.l. immunization are comparable to those elicited by i.n. immunization which has been considered to be the best immunization route for induction of broad mucosal and systemic immune responses [30], indicating that s.l. immunization with rADV-S is an option for effective induction of systemic immunity. Importantly, s.l. immunization with rADV-S induced nAb at the level that is presumably protective against the challenge with live virus. It has been reported that nAbs targeting S protein play an important role in protection against SARS-CoV infection [47]. We found all immunization routes including s.l. immunization induced nAb titers above 1/35 that is considered to be protective in mice [36], indicating that our designed rADV-S is suitable for induction of protective immunity to wild type SARS-CoV.",

Although i.n. delivery of vaccines induces effectively protective immunity, several observations raised safety concerns for its use in humans [7,25]. I.n. delivery of protein antigen together with CT as an adjuvant redirects antigen to CNS [31] and i.n. delivery of inactivated influenza vaccine caused Bell\u2019s palsy in some human recipients [52]. In addition, i.n. delivery of rADV redirects the virus to the olfactory bulb via retrograde transport. These concerns call for an alternative immunization route for safe and effective induction of mucosal immune responses. Oral vaccination has been known to induce mucosal immunity and is safer than i.n. immunization, however degradation of the vaccine by the acidic pH and proteolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract complicate the oral vaccination [2].

            "text": "The ectodomain (amino acids 14\u2013891) of the SARS-CoV S protein lacking the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmatic tail was codon-optimized for high-level expression in mammalian cells and synthesized by GenScript Co. (Piscataway, NJ). The natural signal sequence was replaced by that of tissue plasminogen activator. Helical regions together with transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain were deleted as previously reported [39]. Briefly, rADV expressing SARS-CoV S gene was generated using the AdEasy Vector System according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To inhibit the expression of SARS-CoV S gene during the course of ADV production, a tetracycline-regulated expression system was adopted. Two tetracycline operator sequences derived from pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) have been inserted between the TATA box of the CMV promoter of pShuttle-CMV (Stratagene), resulting in pShuttle-TetO2. After subcloning of SARS-CoV S gene into pShuttle-TetO2 (Figure 1A), this was co-transformed with adenoviral backbone vector, pAdEasy, into Escherichia coli (E. coli) BJ5183 by electroporation to achieve homologous recombination. The resulting construct was transfected into T-Rex-293 cells (Invitrogen) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. T-Rex-293 cells were maintained according to the manual. Recombinant ADV was isolated from a single plaque, expanded in T-Rex-293 cells, and purified by double cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. The purified viruses were extensively dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, 5% sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2 and stored in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Titers of ADV were determined by Tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) and by plaque assays in T-Rex-293 cells.",

Complexes were then enzymatically biotinylated by BirA ligase (Avidity, Denver, CO) and were purified by Superdex-75 gel filtration and Mono-Q anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The biotinylated monomer complexes were tetramerized with PE-labeled streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Tetramers were stored at 5 mg/ml in PBS (pH 8.0) containing 0.02% sodium azide, 1 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin, 1 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mM EDTA at 4\u00b0C. The lungs were perfused with 5 ml of PBS containing 10 U/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich) through the right ventricle using a syringe fitted with 25-gauge needle. The lungs were then removed and placed into RPMI medium supplemented with glutamine, gentamicin, penicillin G, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT). The tissues were then processed through a steel screen to obtain single cell suspension, and particulate matter was removed by passing through 70 \u03bcm Falcon cell strainer (BD Labware). Freshly explanted lung cells were then purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Spleen cells from immunized mice were resuspended in complete IMDM at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/ml. A total of 100 \u03bcl of these cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells) were stained for CD8 (clone 53\u20136.7), CD44 (clone IM7), and Kd/SARS-CoV tetramer and samples were acquired on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For intracellular staining, the cells were first stained for CD8 and CD44, washed, fixed and permeabilized with FACS buffer containing 0.5% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-IFN-\u03b3 (XMG1.2) (eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA) or its control isotype Ab (rat IgG1) (eBioscience). Gates were set on lymphocytes by forward and side scatter profiles, and the data were analyzed using WinMDI version 2.9 software (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).",
