Adequate progress can only be achieved by integrating local, provincial, and national systems [3]. Health systems are essential to enhance disaster resilience, and therefore planning at all levels should include health care facilities, such as tertiary hospitals, primary health care facilities, public health departments, and emergency medical services [4]. Within regional health systems, tertiary hospitals are the key component, as they are the main providers of health care during disasters. They also provide leadership during response phase of a disaster, and represent a critical linkage for disaster management for the whole system.",

Moreover, standardised or consistent methods for describing and measuring hospital resilience or relevant comprehensive ability are lacking [17]. Understanding the status of hospital disaster resilience is the first step in planning to enhance effective emergency response of hospitals. This article aims to explore the current status of disaster resilience in tertiary hospitals in Shandong Province. It has four objectives: (1) to identify the current status of tertiary hospitals\u2019 ability to cope with disasters in the Province; (2) offer references for similar studies; (3) to test the construct validity and the utility of an emerging framework as a basis for understanding and measuring hospital disaster resilience; and (4) to identify any variability in hospital disaster resilience in Shandong Province using this framework, in order to inform a more cohesive approach to health authorities and hospital managers.",

Shandong province is the second largest province and is located in the east of China. In this study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in tertiary hospitals of Shandong province in China. A total of 50 tertiary hospitals in Shandong Province were selected using stratified random sampling according to their subgroups (i.e., Grade A, B, C). The sample was composed of 28 tertiary A hospitals, 20 tertiary B hospitals and 2 tertiary C hospitals, which was selected using the contact list obtained from the Provincial health department. Between January 2013 and June 2013, the questionnaire accompanied by an official letter from the provincial health department stating the importance of the survey was sent to these hospitals. Each hospital was asked to designate a department director to be responsible for coordinating the completion of the questionnaire.

For onsite-rescue, most (92.7%) had their own ambulances, among them 73.7% had ward-type ambulances, but only 15.8% had access to a negative pressure isolation ambulance. Only two of them had their own rescue helicopters and access to a helicopter landing pad. More than half (65.8%) could dispatch emergency staff during disasters for the on-site rescue. About one third (31.7%) could organise an independent rescue team that is equipped with emergency package of supplies for living 3 days (including daily necessities, a set of emergency package, and first aid kit, et al.). Not surprisingly, among them most (92.3%) were tertiary A hospitals. Less than a quarter of the hospitals (22.0%) were equipped with portable medical equipment (e.g., portable breathing machine, ECG monitoring machine, and the X-ray machine), and all of these hospitals were tertiary A. The rescue teams comprised physicians, nurses and administrative staff from various departments (e.g., surgery department, medicine department, psychology department, infection control department and management department), and the dispatched staff number had a wide range from 13 persons to 103 persons. Over a third (36.6%) of the responding hospitals had an on-site command vehicle and a similar proportion (39.0%) had on-site communication equipment for data transmission, video-audio connection, and remote consultation. However, only 4.88% hospitals had a \u2018portable hospital\u2019 or the capability to support field surgery, and other critical care in the field, which is similar to the function of ICU (using vehicles which are equipped with beds, and portable medical equipment).",

This framework of hospital resilience provides a starting point for integrating these key components of hospital resilience together into a comprehensive disaster management framework (including prevention, preparedness, responsiveness, and recovery and adaptation phases). It also seeks to make an achievable goal of improving hospital pre-disaster strength (robustness) and promoting rapidity of response and recovery. This goal can be achieved through a wide range of management approaches including redundancy of processes and resources, and resourcefulness (or flexibility) of plans or strategies (i.e.: can be reflected by some key variables in the survey) [22-26].",

This may be due to different levels or types of hospitals having divergent functions in disasters. For example, most (92.3%) of the hospitals that have been assigned missions were tertiary A, and thus they should be more resilient to disasters for health service supply, and should have better arrangements in the above areas for disaster preparedness and response.",

Thus, to some extent, it was validated the representativeness of the sample in this study to reflect the status of the province. Additionally, it was found that hospital disaster preparedness in Shandong province is close to Beijing (the capital city), and it is above the average level of preparedness in China, due to economic factors and other factors [13].

However, there is still insufficiency of on-site medical rescue, especially a lack of \u201cportability\u201d of critical care service (i.e., patient transport and bringing care to the patient). These two models of on-site rescue still need to be further developed, as they are scalable, mobile and can surge medical care service significantly even after catastrophic disasters [28]. Additionally, medical care capability requires significant surge capacity during disasters, with a critical feature of hospital staffed beds [4]. In US, most hospitals had plans and flexible procedures for surging staffed beds [27]. Also it has been surveyed that in the hospitals of Kentucky, the surge capacity equal to 27% of licensed beds [29].

            "text": "The current study has several limitations. Firstly, the likelihood of non-response bias was likely to exist. As a relatively larger percentage of tertiary A hospitals replied to the survey than the tertiary B and tertiary C hospitals. Although two reminders were sent to the hospital coordinators, there were still 9 hospitals who failed to attend the survey. The follow-up telephones demonstrated that they could not assign the responsible staff to fill the survey, or they are lack of relevant data. Thus it is very possible that the 41 participating hospitals may have relatively good backgrounds of disaster rescue than other 9 nonparticipation hospitals. Also, we suspect that the participating hospitals are better prepared in terms of disaster management than the non-participating hospitals. Secondly, due to the sample size (n = 41), it was possible that not all the significant difference of the mean score of each domain was tested statistically between different hospital categories (as illustrated in Table 1). Despite the limitation, the sample accounted for 52.1% of total hospitals that the study targeted, and did get a response rate over 80%. Thirdly, as the findings are self-reported by the respondents there may be a bias in their reporting. While the inclusion of official documents from Provincial Health Bureaus may have encouraged respondents to complete survey, this may have also been interpreted as an official assessment, thus leading some hospital representatives to overestimate their capability. Fourthly, due to ethical issues, the surveyed hospitals have to be anonymous which impedes comparison with their actual levels of preparedness. Finally, the study was undertaken only in one Province of China. And due to the limitation of funding and investigation time, stratified sampling was used in this study rather than investigating all the tertiary hospitals.",

The difference between tertiary A and tertiary B hospitals was also identified in essential areas. A framework was presented which may assist hospitals to better understand what constitutes effective hospital resilience. The framework may also assist hospitals to undertake a self-analysis or audit of their current plans and capacity, and to use this information for future planning. Clearly, more progress is still needed to improve hospital disaster resilience, especially the focus of community-wide disaster cooperation, on-site medical rescue, and hospital patient care surging capacity. It has been shown that hospitals need to take a more cohesive approach to be resilient in order to position themselves to be able to best cope with a potential disaster.",
