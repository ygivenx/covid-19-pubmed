RSV causes common cold like symptoms that can progress to LRTI leading to hospitalization, significant morbidity and even mortality [1\u20137]. By the age of three, nearly all children have been exposed to RSV at least once and re-infection is common throughout life [3, 8]. RSV has been estimated to cause 3.4 million LRTI episodes that require hospitalization and up to 199,000 deaths of children under 5 years old, mostly in developing countries [9]. No vaccines or therapeutics are currently on the market since the discovery of the virus in 1957 [10]. Only high-risk premature infants are qualified to receive expensive passive immunization of Synagis\u00ae (Palivizumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets a conserved epitope of the RSV fusion protein [11]. At this time, treatment of severe RSV disease consists of supportive care, such as hydration and oxygenation.",

The 15.2 kb genome is non-segmented, single stranded and encodes 11 proteins in 10 genes [3]. Three of the proteins are present in the envelope of the virus: the attachment glycoprotein (G), the fusion glycoprotein (F) and the small hydrophobic (SH) protein. RSV entry has been theorized to follow the entry model of other paramyxoviruses, where the G protein initiates binding to the host cell through interactions with GAGs [12, 13], followed by F-mediated fusion of the host membrane with the viral envelop, allowing virus entry [14]. The location of RSV fusion has to be further elucidated, since evidence is available for RSV using different pathways into the cell. Main theories consist of fusion at the cell surface or entry by endocytic mechanisms such as macropinocytosis [15], caveolae [14, 16] or endosomes [14] followed by fusion.",

Therefore, other paths are being researched to discover alternative antiviral pathways and inhibition methods. In this view, host proteases which have been shown to be involved in many viral activities such as uncoating, viral protein production and post-translational modifications, provide potential antiviral targets through the use of protease inhibitors. The advantage of developing inhibitors for host proteins is that they generally have a reduced risk for the induction of drug resistance [17, 18]. For viruses such as Ebola [19], HCV, HIV [20], Influenza [21] and MERS [22], host proteases have been described that play an essential role in virus replication, allowing the use of specific protease inhibitors to reduce the infection.",

The RSV F protein is synthesized in the host cell as a 68 kDa precursor, F0, which is transported to the cell surface through the trans-Golgi network where it is activated by a double cleavage performed by furin [23], resulting in two disulfide-linked membrane anchored subunits of approximately 48 kDa (F1) and 20 kDa (F2) [24\u201326] and the release of a 27 amino acid long peptide called Pep27 [27]. This enzymatic processing is associated with structural changes and is required to activate the fusogenicity of the F protein [15, 28]. The RSV G protein was recently shown to be subjected to cleavage by Cathepsin L during endocytic recycling in Vero cells, resulting in a smaller size, but this feature seems to occur only in Vero cells [29].",

This single infection cycle technique consists of an inoculation period of 2 h, followed by an incubation period to allow viral protein expression, but before a second round of replication can be detected. Afterwards, cells were fixed, stained with polyclonal antibody (pAb) anti-RSV IgG and quantified by counting the number of cells expressing RSV proteins versus the total number of nuclei. Kinetic experiments of the RSV A2 infection in cell lines allowed us to follow the replication of the virus in the cell by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). Expression of viral proteins in the cytoplasm is detected by the pAb and this visualizes the viral replication (Fig. 1b): at 6 h post infection, the first signs of translation of viral proteins become visible as faint fluorescent spots in the cytoplasm. At 12 h post infection, the viral proteins have spread throughout the entire cell cytoplasm. At 18 h post infection, we reproducibly observed a plateau phase of the number of RSV positive cells, indicating all viable RSV particles have infected cells resulting in production of viral proteins (Fig. 1a). Signs of budding and release of new virus were first observed at 16 h post infection and continued throughout the rest of the assay (data not shown), indicating the start of a new infection cycle which would show new signs of infection at the earliest 6 h later. By using this single infection cycle assay, inhibitors that specifically have an effect on the entry (attachment or fusion) or intracellular replication of RSV can be identified, without interference of potential effects on virus assembly, release and spreading.\n",

Peri-inoculation treatment was comprised of treatment during the 2 h inoculation phase which would inhibit proteases needed for attachment, fusion and uncoating. The post-inoculation phase started when the inoculum was removed 2 h post inoculation and replaced with complete medium. AEBSF was administered to the culture in a final concentration of 0.3 mM in each phase separately or in multiple phases. These time-of-addition experiments indicated that treatment only during the pre-inoculation phase did not result in a significant decrease of the RSV infection. Minor, but significant decreases were observed in the peri-inoculation only treatment, and the post-inoculation treatment only, as well as the combined treatment comprised of pre- and peri-inoculation treatment. Treatment that combines the post-inoculation phase with either the pre- or the peri-inoculation phase did result in a larger significant decrease of RSV infection.

Cells were placed at 4 \u00b0C 1 h prior to RSV infection to ensure a completely cooled culture. Cold inoculum was placed on the cells, followed by incubation at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h to allow attachment of the virus. Afterwards, the inoculum was removed, the cells were washed once with cold medium to remove unbound particles and complete medium at 37 \u00b0C was added to the cells to induce a temperature shift to 37 \u00b0C. Cells were further incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h, fixed, stained and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Treatment during the peri-inoculation phase at 4 \u00b0C only did not result in a decrease in RSV infection which we considered normal since the cell metabolism is shut down at 4 \u00b0C and the virus particle only attaches at this temperature, however addition of AEBSF at the temperature change in the post-inoculation phase did result in a significant decrease of infected cells. This decrease is similar to the near complete block observed when AEBSF is present during combined peri-inoculation and post-inoculation treatment. These results confirm previous results and suggest that AEBSF treatment of RSV infection is most potent after the attachment of the virion to the host cell and before the start of replication.",

Since many of the compounds evaluated may have a limited half-life in cell culture or inhibit an enzyme pool that is quickly replenished, it is important to address inhibition effects when the compound is still active. Therefore, we developed an assay to visualize and quantify one cycle of RSV infection in immortalized cell lines, 18 h after inoculation by using antibody staining to follow the protein replication of RSV. This allows for a sensitive detection of potential effects of protease inhibitors on the RSV infection. This single infection cycle assay can pick up disturbances in the replication at very early stages of the infection, which would result in a decrease of infected cells or a change in cell morphology that can be easily detected by counting and evaluating the number and shape of infected cells with fluorescence microscopy.",

These experiments clearly showed that treatment would only result in a near complete block when AEBSF was present at the same time as the virus inoculum. Pre-treatment did not differ significantly from the non-treated control and neither did peri-inoculation treatment at 37 \u00b0C. Post-inoculation treatment resulted in a significant decrease of the infection as did all the treatments combining phases. The most notable decrease in RSV infection was achieved by the combined treatment of peri- and post-inoculation treatment. This decrease was comparable to the earlier experiments in which the treatment was continued throughout all phases, which indicates that pre-treatment with AEBSF has no effect on the RSV infection.",

However, in our experiments at 37 \u00b0C, pre-treatment of the cells had no effect on infection, indicating that the cellular protease that mediates fusion or uncoating is not yet present, active or accessible. This suggests that the binding of RSV is needed to induce enzyme activity that can be blocked by the inhibitor. This hypothesis was tested by inoculating the cells at 4 \u00b0C, at which the virus can attach to the cells but cannot fuse. As also enzymatic activity is halted at 4 \u00b0C, binding of the particle to the cell will not yet influence the activity or accessibility of the enzyme that is inhibited by AEBSF. Afterwards, the cells were given warm medium and were incubated at 37 \u00b0C to induce fusion of the virus with the host cell as well as re-activation of enzymatic processes. A near complete block of RSV infection was observed in the HEp-2 cells that were treated with AEBSF starting from the moment the cells were placed at 37 \u00b0C, compared with the marginal decrease in the cells treated peri-inoculation at 4 \u00b0C. This indicated that AEBSF is most potent at the moment of the temperature shift, presumably the time of fusion of the particle with the host cell.",
