Although it has a mild and self-liming course, it can be severe and cause complications that carry a significant risk of death. In the United States, more than 3,00,000 patients are admitted with incident pancreatitis and about 20,000 die from the disease each year.[1\u20133] In Taiwan, the incidence rate of acute pancreatitis is 0.03% and the mortality rate among severe acute pancreatitis is 16.3%.[4] The pancreas is a source of hormones, insulin, and glucagons that are important for regulating metabolism. The key exocrine function of the pancreas is to produce pancreatic juices that contain water, bicarbonate, and various digestive enzymes.[5]",

Epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting are the main symptoms of acute pancreatitis. Abdominal pain, which occurs in about 95% of cases, typically occurs acutely, and rapidly reaches maximum intensity.[1,16] Two key diagnostic tests for acute pancreatitis involve measuring the levels of serum amylase and serum lipase. Measurement of serum amylase is a very sensitive diagnostic test, but has low specificity.[17] Measurement of serum lipase, however, has a much higher sensitivity (90%) and specificity (90%) for diagnosing acute pancreatitis.[18] Treatment for acute pancreatitis includes pain control, intravenous fluids, pancreatic rest, and monitoring for complications. Aggressive surgical intervention may be necessary for patients who have signs of infected necrosis and whose disease is not controllable by conservative methods.[19] Nutrition should be instituted within a few days.",

National health care expenditure in Taiwan increased from 5.3% to 6.0% of gross national product during the period 1995 to 2001. The NHI used to operate on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis and as a result health care spending increased by approximately 50% during the period 1995 to 2001. In order to prevent unlimited and rapid growth of spending on health care, the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) implemented global budgeting to modify the FFS mechanism in 2002. Global budgeting in Taiwan is an overall spending target, designed to limit the volume of service and its total price.[20\u201324] The global budgeting program adopted in Taiwan is an expenditure-cap system with a \u201cfloating point value\u201d mechanism. The national budget for a given year is determined before the end of the previous year by consultation between the BNHI and hospital representatives. The aggregate level of expenditure in the previous year and age structure of the population determine the size of the national budget. The monetary value of each point has been equal to the fixed budget divided by the number of points that all hospitals claim, so it fluctuates to precisely match the pre-determined budget. Reimbursement to providers is based on an existing FFS schedule, which lists a relative value or number of points for each item of service. The degree of cuts in reimbursement was measured based on the quarterly monetary value of each point.",

Possible reasons for the incremental increases in health care expenditures during the study period include longer LOS, older age, and the presence of more comorbidities in the study population. Another possible cause is that the in an expenditure cap system, the budget is fixed ex ante but the reimbursement prices are determined ex poste. Once the services have been provided, the prices of those services are adjusted so that the fixed budget will cover them. In this type of situation, providers are in a situation similar to Cournot competitors, having to make supply decisions before knowing the price they will receive for the service, because the price of the service will be determined by the summed supply decisions of all the providers. Each provider will have an incentive to increase their supply and result in a rise in the total costs post global budgeting.",

Those findings indicate that the quality of care of patients with acute pancreatitis improved after adoption of the global budgeting system. Improvements in care may be attributed to the use of more effective antibiotics, advances in standard operative procedures, and better-trained medical providers. After adjusting for other covariates, there was a significantly negative correlation between global budgeting and the risk of readmission within 14 days. The impact of global budgeting on the risk of revisiting the ED within 3 days, however, was not significant. Neither hospital accreditation level nor geographic area was associated with the risk of revisiting the ED within 3 days. Nevertheless, patients treated at local hospitals were at significantly lower risk of readmission within 14 days than patients treated at medical centers. Risk factors for early re-admission in patients with acute pancreatitis include moderate to heavy alcohol use, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), and diet at the time of discharge.[34] Those patient characteristics were not available from the database; it is, therefore, not clear whether those factors played a role in early readmission in this study. The reasons why patients treated in local hospitals were at a lower risk of readmission within 14 days than patients in medical centers is also not clear. Whether patients with acute pancreatitis in local hospitals received better quality care than patients in medical centers or whether patients in medical centers had more risk factors for early re-admission needs to be investigated.",

Sixty-three percent of physicians are salaried employees of hospitals, some receiving bonus payments based on productivity. In response to an expenditure cap, physicians increased their activity levels including do more tests, provide more complex and high-priced procedures which make diagnostic costs, therapy costs, and total costs significantly increased after global budgeting. The major treatment for acute pancreatitis includes supportive care, fluid resuscitation, transfer to intensive care unit and enteral feeding. Since routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended; drug costs after global budget were not affected significantly. It has been reported that the launch of global budgets leads to an increase in the quantity of medical services supply to maximize profits. In order to maximize revenue, the medical providers in Taiwan present incentives to increase medical care utilization and result in significantly longer length of stay after global budgeting. Market competition between hospitals continues to increase in the health-care industry. For survival, hospitals must focus on quality of care. Furthermore, if the hospital has the plans to improve its service quality, there is more room for a hospital to negotiate the expenditure cap with the BNHI. Thus quality of care significantly improved after global budgeting in Taiwan.",
