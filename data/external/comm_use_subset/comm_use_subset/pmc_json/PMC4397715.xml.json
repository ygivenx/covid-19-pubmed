Evaluations of recent crises show large variation in the implementation of crisis advice and thus in the quality of outbreak response. A Dutch study examining the response to the Q-fever outbreak showed large regional variance in the implementation of the nationally advised measures [7]. Similarly, evaluation of the control measures during the early stages of the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) outbreak in the various EU countries showed great differences between countries with respect to case definitions, laboratory testing and antimicrobial drug treatment [8]. A study examining the causes of differences in the implementation of crisis advice showed that among others, the various categories of professionals involved in outbreak control lacked clearly defined measures to monitor the execution of \u2018key actions\u2019 [9].",

A limitation of our study is that, from the 656 recommendations which served as a basis for the first questionnaire round, only 35 were extracted from the international literature. In addition, the recommendations are merely practice and expert opinion based. Expert opinion is considered to be the lowest degree of evidence [66]. This is in line with Yeager et al., who studied the literature and concluded that \u201cthe public health emergency preparedness literature is dominated by nonempirical studies\u201d. They also describe how only 15 percent of scientific literature on infectious disease outbreaks concerns the response to outbreaks [67]. Although this explains the lack of evidence based recommendations in our study, at the same time it stresses the importance of building a knowledge base for \u2018good quality\u2019 response to infectious disease outbreaks. Our set of key could be the starting point for such methodologically sound empirical studies. Another limitation of our study is that our results are, for pragmatic reasons, based on judgments by Dutch experts and partly on Dutch grey literature which may reduce transferability to other countries. To reduce this risk as much as possible, we used a large group of experienced experts with various backgrounds. In addition, a considerable part of the Dutch grey literature is based on documents issued by supranational institutions (e.g. the WHO checklist, ECDC or CDC guidelines). We therefore assume that our key recommendations describe essential elements of outbreak response and will have an added value in improving efforts to deliver high quality response to outbreaks. These key recommendations are formulated in such a way that they allow for adaptation to fit the specific organizational structure of different countries. Most countries have their own national guidelines. European countries lacking national guidelines are very likely to use ECDC guidance instead (such as the RAGIDA guidelines or guidance disseminated through Rapid Risk Assessments).",
