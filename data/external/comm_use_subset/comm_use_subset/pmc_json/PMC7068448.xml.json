Leptospirosis is directly or indirectly transmitted to humans [5] through contact with infected animal urine in water, soil, or other materials [6,7]. Among animals that are most likely to spread the disease are rodents (20%), marsupials (35%) and bats (35%) [8].",

All these activities provide a conducive environment which favours the presence of rodents [9,10]. Recent studies also showed that pathogens of Leptospira sp were present in trapped rodents and environmental samples in wet market areas. Poor environmental settings of wet markets are known as sources for certain infections and have attracted certain rodent species [10]. The increasing number of rodents in these areas is mainly due to presence of food remnants, poor sanitation and improper waste disposal [11].",

One of the major international migrations in Malaysia was among the refugee community. Malaysia has been accepting refugees from a humanitarian point of view, and the country did not sign the Refugee Convention [14,15]. Therefore, its role remains confined to receive refugees based on a humanitarian point of view without available clear lines that define and regulate their lives, issues, rights and demands in the country [14]. Attention is given only to some groups that have received United Nations High Commissions for Refugees (UNHCR) cards, but this did little to improve their access to various services, such as education and health [16,17]. A major setting where non-Malaysians are working include services sectors like plantations, restaurants and wet markets [18].",

The questionnaire consisted of five main sections which covered demographic and socioeconomic information, knowledge about leptospirosis, attitude towards leptospirosis prevention and preventive leptospirosis practices. Content validation was carried out through a discussion with content experts and cross-referenced with documented scientific materials. Construct validation was done through item analysis in which questions with low reliability were deleted. Assessment of reliability was done through internal consistency reliability analysis. Cronbach\u2019s alpha values for scope of knowledge, attitude and practice in the questionnaires were 0.71, 0.76 and 0.70, respectively.

Presence of a significant proportion of non-Malaysian workers in wet market settings has led to new landscape variations in the heterogeneity of social strata in Malaysian population. With a significant number of foreign workers in wet market setting, our healthcare approach is recommended to address specific information delivery in respective languages to prevent the occurrence of specific diseases. These findings enhanced the understanding of delivering health information related to leptospirosis, and the focus should be prioritised not only to Malaysian but also to non-Malaysian workers.",

Besides, it is crucial to target the public, especially those with low education levels to have positive attitudes toward leptospirosis prevention. This information can be used to develop relevant interventions aimed at urban markets, especially at high rodent infestation areas. A future study to investigate knowledge, attitude and practice on leptospirosis prevention among wet market workers in rural areas is recommended to provide additional information on the actual view of leptospirosis perception in market workers as a whole.",
