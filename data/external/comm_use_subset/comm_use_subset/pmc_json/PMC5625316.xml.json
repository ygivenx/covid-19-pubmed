A conceptual framework for understanding a reservoir of infection has been established through various studies that have emphasized different aspects of zoonotic diseases.1, 2, 3, 4 However, empirical characterization of reservoirs often remains controversial and challenging. The most applicable and accepted way to investigate and define a reservoir emphasizes the annotation of a target group (Figure 1), which is an explicitly defined population of interest in a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape (for example, humans at the livestock\u2013wildlife\u2013human interface).4, 5 According to Haydon et al.,4 the target group is a matter of definition and may therefore be disconnected from the ecological reality. The target group provides a directionality to the study of a reservoir system. All other susceptible populations (non-target populations), which directly or indirectly connect epidemiologically to the target (Figures 1 and 2), can be part of the potential reservoir.4 For a non-target population to be considered an accepted functional reservoir, maintenance of a single pathogen in the population needs to be shown in combination with a feasible transmission route between the target and non-target populations.4",

The simplicity and functional orientation of the presented framework allows for straightforward application but does not negate more complex populations, as the same principles can be applied to multi-species systems and metapopulations (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Increases in technological advancements (for example, next-generation sequencing) and vast quantities of available data have not led to concrete applicable criteria when examining the capacity of a pathogen to be maintained in a population. Recognizing both the ethical limitations in regards to animal testing8 and the advances in the molecular detection of pathogens, we propose the following criteria to demonstrate the maintenance of a pathogen in a population: (i) a high-genetic similarity of the pathogen found in the reservoir system, (ii) a high degree of functional similarity (infectivity and viability), and (iii) a longitudinal approach that considers the factor of time (Table 1). Owing to the functional orientation of the requirements and for simplicity, all entities involved in the biological lifecycles of a parasite (for example, primary and intermediate hosts) should be considered a single functional unit. Appropriate sequence and functional analysis of a pathogen isolated multiple times from a potential reservoir should be required to prove that a pathogen is maintained in a population. The ability to quickly and cheaply sequence whole genomes has allowed for better genetic resolution.49, 50 Sequence data can be used to examine similarity in the pathogen between a potential reservoir and a target. However, mutation rates vary significantly between pathogens51, 52 and the threshold for sequence and functional similarity must be individually defined and accepted by the scientific community. A single-nucleotide difference can potentially result in a loss of infectivity, for example, when important invasion mechanisms are affected (receptor affinity). In bacteria, investigations can be further complicated by plasmids that can be exchanged and mutated over time.53 A high amount of phylogenetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from the non-target and target populations does not provide sufficient evidence for the involvement of a pathogen and its ability to infect both groups. Importantly, DNA-based analyses only provide information on the functional potential of a pathogen and must not reflect the gene-expression within a host.54 For example, the bacterium Treponema paraluiscuniculi (which causes syphilis in rabbits), is over 99% identical on the basis of the whole genome to the human pathogen T. pallidum (which causes human treponematosis), but does not infect humans.55 As phylogenetic information fails to reflect the downstream effects of mutations, proof that a pathogen can proliferate in the potential reservoir is required.56 Information on the transcriptome and proteome of bacteria or the phenotype of viruses are necessary to see the effect of mutations on pathogen viability.57 There are different ways to test for the functional ability of a pathogen in different species. Owing to the ethical concerns, cell and tissue assays have been increasingly used in therapeutic research instead of animal models.8 Although these assays are limited in their conclusiveness, they can provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms involved. For example, the failure to infect primary tissue culture from rhesus macaques with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) demonstrates that non-human primates were unlikely to act as a maintenance population (Table 1).58 In some instances, for example, with uncultivable bacteria such as Treponema pallidum, it may be necessary to use animal models to examine the functionality of a pathogen within a potential reservoir species. Knowledge of the biology of the pathogen is essential to properly define a sequence and functional similarity threshold for a particular reservoir system.",

Defining a population that was infected at a single time point as a maintenance population for a pathogen is based on assumptions and is therefore speculative. Sero-prevalence surveys are an attractive way to detect the presence of pathogens in a population, as it indicates that an immunocompetent subject was in contact with the pathogen.1 However, only longitudinal studies with adequate sampling regimes (multiple sampling) to test for antibodies against a pathogen can provide information on the timing or frequency of infection, both of which are important for reservoir studies.59 Furthermore, cross-reactivity and erroneous assays can lead to false-positive results. For more diffuse reservoir systems, including multi-species compositions where the diversity of host susceptibility (at the individual, species or population level) protects against widespread infection (dilution effect),60 a longer time frame must be applied. This guarantees a more accurate understanding of the maintenance within a population (for example, Ebola36).",

For multi-species reservoir systems, the transmission route between the target and non-target populations may be indirect (Figure 2, connection between b and target), possibly incorporating different hierarchical levels of a non-target community.4, 61 The type of transmission route dictates the form of evidence needed to prove that a feasible transmission route exists between the reservoir and target. For simplicity, we define vectors as part of the transmission route, although under certain circumstances (for example, permanency or substantial amplification in the vector), they may act as part of the non-target community.61 Four basic requirements need to be met to make a compelling argument for the existence of a feasible transmission route: (i) spatial (direct or indirect) and temporal connectivity between the reservoir system and the target population, (ii) pathogen involvement in this feasible transmission route, (iii) proof of viability of the pathogen during the proposed transmission route and (iv) a longitudinal approach that requires the isolation of a pathogen multiple times in a given transmission route (Table 1).",

Connectivity measurements depend on the type of transmission route; for example, direct contact transmission requires overlapping territory. Computational tools can help determine the necessary overlap in a population by modeling the transmission across an affected population.62 In addition to spatial and temporal overlap, the involvement of the pathogen in the particular transmission route needs to be shown, which again requires long-term field projects. In the case of Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, nucleic acids from the bacterium were detected in ticks using PCR.44 However, the detection of DNA does not directly prove that transmission occurs. To gain further confidence that the transmission is feasible, it is therefore essential to show that the infectious organism remains viable during the proposed transmission route.45 This means that in addition to PCR detection, the viable pathogen needs to be isolated during a transmission event, where the measure of viability depends on the type of pathogen. In airborne transmission, for example, environmental factors such as size of droplets, UV light and humidity can greatly influence the transmissibility of a virus (as reviewed in Tang63). If the amount of viable and therefore infectious organisms is below the infectious dose, the particular transmission route is unfeasible. Without a feasible transmission route between target and non-target populations, no functional reservoir exists. Furthermore, to include all parts of a reservoir population, long-term investigations must focus on the transmission between the non-target and target groups as well as feasible transmission within the non-target community.61 Unconnected maintenance host populations may become a future reservoir through temporal shifts of the ecosystem.",

Well-designed intervention studies can be used as quasi-experiments to study a reservoir of infection but should not be used as a stand-alone test for the existence of a reservoir.1 Despite sufficient planning, the cause and effect of intervention studies are often difficult to determine1, 64 and the removal of a pathogen from a particular ecosystem may cause unanticipated effects.
