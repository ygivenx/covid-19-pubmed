Moreover, some genomic sequences have been found not to cluster with HRV-A and HRV-B species, which suggests the existence of other species (HRV-C and HRV-D) [16]. A new species of HRV-C was recently identified worldwide by comparative analysis of VP4 or VP4/VP2 genes [7], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] and 5\u2032UTR [14], [15]. However, discrepancies have appeared in the classification of some of the new HRV-A or HRV-C strains, depending on the size and location of the nucleotide sequence in the viral genome and on the phylogenetic methods used for direct analysis of HRV sequences [3], [7], [14], [15], [17], [18], [20], [21], [22], [23].",

Moreover, little is known about the characteristics and diversity of HRVs circulating in a given area in a short period of time. In the present study, we looked for HRVs in a 2-year collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) of children with ARI visiting a district hospital in Shanghai, and compared sequences in two regions previously defined for genetic classification of HRV serotypes [13], [15]. Our study showed a high diversity of HRV species and genotypes, and a prevalence of the novel HRV-C species in NPSs of children with bronchitis and pneumonia. This biodiversity appeared to result partly from recombination events in the 5\u2032UTR, between HRV-C strains and those close or similar to HRV-A species, which led to the suggested classification of HRV-C into at least two subspecies.",

Sixty-four samples (7.7%) were positive for HRV, according to the length of the amplified fragment in the VP4/VP2 region visualized on agarose gel (data not shown). A larger fragment of 924 nt, including part of the 5\u2032UTR (starting at nt 163) and the VP4/VP2 genes (ending at nt 1086), was amplified and cloned into plasmid vectors for genetic analysis (Table 1). Only one sample, N1, could not be amplified and was amplified in two steps in the 5\u2032UTR (nt 163\u2013552) and in the VP4/VP2 region (nt 528\u20131086), respectively. Analyses of different clones for each sample allowed the identification of multiple infections: sample N16 was shown to contain one HRV-A and one HRV-B (N16A and N16B, respectively), while N58 contained one HRV-A and one HRV-C (N58A and N58C, respectively) (see below). In order to further characterize the 66 HRVs identified in the 64 samples, the nucleotide sequences located in the 5\u2032UTR (285 nt) and the VP4/VP2 genes (420 nt) were chosen to allow comparative alignment with sequences of reference serotypes and field strains available in GenBank.",

HRV-Ca nucleotide sequences were scanned against sequences of N10, R16 and R52, which are considered as representative strains of HRV Cc subspecies and HRV-A and HRV-B species, respectively. Stretches of nucleotide sequences that were closer to HRV-A (R16) than to HRV-Cc (N10), flanked by sequences related to HRV-C could be detected in the 5\u2032UTR of HRV-Ca strains, as exemplified with HRV-Ca N25 strain (Fig. 3a and b). These HRV-A-related nucleotide stretches were thus flanked by putative recombination sites. These sites were located differently among the HRV-Ca strains, delimiting HRV-A-related stretches that ranged from 150 to 400 nt in length (Fig. 3c). While variable among the strains, the identified recombination sites were all located inside the 5\u2032 UTR and none of them was identified in the downstream VP4/VP2 coding sequence. HRV-A-related nucleotide sequences and putative recombination sites were also found in the 5\u2032UTR of the previously described HRV-C strains C024, C025, C026, NAT001, NAT045 and QPM (Fig. 3). The results corroborated the clustering observed in the phylogenetic tree based on 5\u2032UTR sequences (Fig. 2), since strains gathered in the same HRV-Ca subcluster (for example N24, N25, N28 and N32, or N4, N7, N8, N21, N36 and N46) displayed the same recombination pattern. These subclusters revealed different recombinant lineages, each of which originated from independent recombination events.",

We characterized by RT-PCR and sequenced 66 HRVs, among them 27 HRV-A, five HRV-B, and 34 HRV-C strains. When sequencing the VP4/VP2 region of the HRV genome, several recent studies have identified new strains of viruses from children and adults with ARI, asthma, or otitis, which are clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B, and have been classified into a novel HRV-C species [7], [8], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Other groups have also identified novel HRV-C strains by sequencing the VP1 gene [29] or the 5\u2032UTR [14], [15] . The different sizes and locations of the regions amplified in the HRV genomes renders difficult comparative genetic analysis. Recently, Palmenberg et al. (2009) have finalized the full-length genome sequences of all HRV-A and HRV-B reference strains, and identified structural features of these two species and the novel HRV-C species [16]. In our study, we identified 34 HRVs (51.5%) that clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B in a phylogenetic tree that was established on the basis of VP4/VP2 sequences, which were related to recent strains classified in the novel HRV-C species (Fig. 1, Table 2). Fourteen HRV-C strains (41.2%) segregated from the other 20 strains (58.8%) that were closely related to HRV-A in their 5\u2032UTR sequence (Fig. 2). This led us to propose a classification of two HRV-C subspecies, HRV-Cc and HRV-Ca. In previous studies targeting the 5\u2032UTR of HRVs, Lee et al. (2007) have identified nine novel HRVs among 103 HRVs from Wisconsin (19.4%), which segregated from HRV-A and HRV-B and were classified as HRV-C [15]. These strains clustered with our field strains within the HRV-Cc subspecies. Moreover, 17 strains that clustered with HRV-A, and had 12\u201335% pairwise nucleotide divergence from the nearest reference serotype [15], clustered within the two major branches of HRV-A and HRV-Ca strains (Fig. 3). Therefore, we cannot ensure that some of the 17 strains were HRV-A or HRV-Ca strains. Kiang et al. (2008) have identified five novel HRVs out of 24 clinical samples (20.8%), which segregated from HRV-A and HRV-B, and were classified as HRV-C, and three additional strains (12.5%) that also clustered with QPM, C024, C025, C026, NAT001 and NAT045 [14] (Fig. 2). However, the field HRV strains of these previous studies were sequenced using a 5\u2032UTR that did not match fully our sequence and that of Lee et al. (2007) [15], and could not be included in the present study for comparative analysis. Interestingly, the five strains identified in California in 2007 [14] and N42 and N45 from our study were closely related to strain W37 isolated in Wisconsin in the late 1990s [15], and to NAT001 isolated in the winter of 2004 in California [18], which confirms that similar genotypes of HRV-Ca are widespread [17].",

Analyzing sequences that covered the 5\u2032UTR and the downstream VP4/VP2 capsid region allowed identification of co-infections when several clones were sequenced, and helped to locate the recombination sites in strains of the HRV-Ca subspecies.

Previous comparison of genome sequences between 34 HRVs showed only limited recombination events and a pattern of genetic diversity lower than that observed with other picornaviruses [25]. The presence in HRV-C subspecies of sequences that share 90.5\u201398.6% identity with HRV-A strains (Table 3) suggests that recombination events occurred between HRV-C and HRV-A. Bootscanning of the 5\u2032UTR of HRV-C strains also showed different sites and lengths of recombination (Fig. 3c), which suggested that there were several independent events that led to several groups of HRV-Ca genotypes, which formed clusters in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2).",

These findings are in agreement with those observed for other HEVs, for which recombination events in the capsid-encoding sequence are very rare, probably because of structural constraints that restrict the functioning of chimeric capsids [31]. This result appeals for the full-length genome sequencing of the major representatives of the HRV-C species, in order to establish a clear understanding of the evolution and classification of the novel virus into subspecies. Comparison of the coding sequences of N10 HRV-Cc with other strains of HRV-Ca subspecies [20], including our field strain N4, showed high similarities in the lengths of the 11 proteins, their cleavage sites, and the structural features of VP1. These characteristics and the absence of growth in cell culture, noted in our laboratory and by others (data not shown), support the classification of the novel strains into a unique HRV-C subspecies.",

            "text": "Our clinical specimens all originated from NPSs from pediatric outpatients. The remarkable outcome of the study is the large diversity of genotypes that has circulated in a relatively small group of people in a district of Shanghai during a 2-year observation. Although some clusters of similar genotypes in a limited period of time were observed, co-circulation of different genotypes and HRV species and subspecies, and co-infections with two HRV species were observed. The prevalence of the novel HRV-C in our specimens (4.1%) differed from previous studies that associated the prevalence of the novel variant with severe disease outcomes, which ranged from influenza-like illness or infection of the low respiratory tract [17], [28] to asthma exacerbation, bronchiolitis, and febrile wheeze [7], [8], [15], [18], [20], [21], [29], [39]. All our patients showed bronchitis or pneumonia, with no etiological correlation with any of the species or subspecies of HRV. Only one patient co-infected with HRV-C, IAV and RSV was diagnosed with asthma among the HRV-positive patients (1.6%), whereas 100 of the 827 children had asthma (12%). The difference observed with previous studies, 44.6% [8] and 12% [29] asthma in HRV-positive patients, may be related to the criteria for enrolment. Moreover, none of the patients in our study were hospitalized, which makes comparison with hospitalized children difficult [20], [24]. Another criterion to consider in the trend to correlate clinical symptoms with HRV infection is the presence of co-infecting pathogens. In our study, four strains of HBoV and six strains of RSV (17.6%) were identified in association with HRV-C (11.7%). HBoV and RSV are common viruses diagnosed in ARI, which are often associated with HRV [40], [41], and HBoV was identified in >50% of children co-infected with HRV [20]. Nevertheless, the incidence of HBoV in ARI and in severe outcomes remains elusive [42]. More studies need to be carried out on large numbers of samples from severe and mild diseases, to identify any obvious role of HRV sequence diversity and association with other pathogens in disease severity. Since a large diversity of recombination in HRVs has become obvious, we must be aware of the occurrence of novel HRVs that may become highly virulent.",

Multiple sequences were aligned using Clustal X [45]. The multiple-sequence alignment was subjected to phylogenetic analyses using programs in the PHYLIP package (v3.6). Bootstrap analysis was performed using SEQBOOT, with a replicate number of 1000. Then, DNADIST and NEIGHBOR were used to obtain distance matrices with the F84 parameter, and a transition/transversion ratio of 4. Consensus trees were computed by CONSENSE, and then re-rooted with RETREE. The final tree was visualized and edited with MEGA version 4 [46].",
