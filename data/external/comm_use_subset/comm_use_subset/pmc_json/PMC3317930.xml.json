It infects approximately 50\u2013100 million people each year, of which 500,000 people exhibit the life-threatening form of severe dengue \u2013 dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1]. The current lack of treatment or licensed vaccine means dengue poses a serious public health threat [2]. Infection by one serotype of DENV confers lifelong immunity against the homologous serotype, but only limited cross-protection to the remaining three serotypes [3], [4]. The presence of cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies generated during a primary infection has been suggested to enhance the pathogenicity of subsequent infections via the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [5]. A successful and safe vaccine candidate must therefore elicit a protective long-lasting immune response to all four serotypes [4], [6]\u2013[8].",

These prM-specific antibodies are highly cross-reactive and non-neutralizing. When complexed with immature DENV (imDENV), it has the ability to render normally non-infectious imDENV highly infectious [11], [12]. This has caused concern over current vaccine candidates that contain native dengue prM [9] \u2013 which is a component of most current vaccine strategies whether naturally attenuated, recombinantly attenuated, yellow fever-dengue-virus chimeras, chemically inactivated virus, DNA vaccine or recombinant subunit protein vaccines [13], [14].

Broadly cross-reactive prM-specific antibodies dominated the screen and the Fab with highest affinity, D29 Fab-IgG, was converted into full-length human IgG1 format for thorough characterization. This antibody (D29 Fab-IgG) was found to have high affinity for a conformational epitope on prM and, like other prM antibodies [11], [12], was capable of restoring the infectivity of virtually non-infectious immature DENV (imDENV) in Fc\u03b3R-bearing K562 cells. The antibody also cross-reacted with E protein \u2013 fine mapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies localized the epitope to the DI/DII junction of E, which would be inaccessible in a native virus particle. This suggests the possibility that immunization strategies employing E protein alone or subunits of E proteins may not be able to completely avoid generation of anti-prM antibodies that enhance DENV infection.",

However, as prM intrinsically interacts with E to form heterodimers, it is possible that antibody binding to one of the components in the heterodimer would pull down the other. To address this, dissociation of the heterodimer with 1.25% SDS was performed prior to the assay. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Identity of the precipitated proteins was verified by non-reducing Western blot analysis with h3H5 and m2H2, respectively (Fig. 3B). The control antibodies were able to precipitate their corresponding binding partners. Despite the ability to recognize both prM and E on western blots, D29 Fab-IgG only precipitated prM.

No TUPs were detected and the resulting 20 unique clones fall into three main consensus groups: 26% contained the motif W(TL/SV)K(L/X)PXW; 14% contained the motif AKTMP and 33% contained the motif KXPXW (Table 1).",

Although most of the selected peptide-phage clones only weakly inhibited D29 Fab-IgG\u2019s binding to DENV2, clone P3 (Cluster 1) and P9 (Cluster 2) significantly competed by 30% and 70%, respectively (Fig. 4C).

Their reactivity with D29 Fab-IgG was tested by Western blot analysis, using h4G2 and m2H2 as control antibodies. All antibodies reacted with their respective protein targets for the non-mutated prM-E protein; however, binding of m2H2 and D29 Fab-IgG to the prM protein was almost completely abolished by mutation at the prM residues in M1 (Fig. 6B). Mutation at the E residues within the P3 sequence (M2) on the other hand, did not have significant impact on the reactivity with D29 Fab-IgG (Fig. 6B). Detection of both M1 and M2 by h4G2 verified the expression of both mutants. To verify the P9 (E) epitope, eight mutants were generated: M3 (E55T-A), M4 (E56L-A, E57R-G), M5 (E129V-A, E131Q-G), M6 (E133E-G, E134N-G), M3/4 (E55T-A, E56L-A, E57R-G), M3/5 (E55T-A, E129V-A, E131Q-G), M4/5 (E56L-A, E57R-G, E129V-A, E131Q-G) and M5/6 (E129V-A, E131Q-G, E133E-G, E134N-G) (Fig. 6A). Both control antibodies were able detect their respective protein targets for all mutants, apart from M3/4 and M4/5 which appeared to be non-viable (Fig. 6B). The binding of h4G2 to E of M4 also appeared to be affected by the mutation introduced (Fig. 6B); likely to be caused by a change of local conformation, rather than a drop of expression level since prM-binding by m2H2 was normal. Notably, the binding of D29 Fab-IgG to the E protein of the M3, M5 and M6 mutants were severely affected; in particular, D29 Fab-IgG failed to detect E of M4 and M5/6, whereas binding of prM for all these mutants was not affected at all (Fig. 6B). Together these results confirm the epitopes identified through peptide-phage display.",

Indeed, D29 Fab-IgG failed to neutralize any of the 4 serotypes of DENV at the highest concentration tested (400 \u00b5g/ml) in a PRNT assay (Table S1). Next, the ability of D29 Fab-IgG to enhance infection of DENV2 and imDENV2 was determined by carrying out ADE assays with Fc\u03b3R-bearing K562 cells. The specific infectivity of the viruses was established by qPCR and plaque assay to be 8.5\u00d7105:1 for imDENV2, which was significantly higher than that of the standard-grown DENV2 at 240:1 (Fig. 7A).",

Cross-reactivity between E and prM has been observed in antibodies isolated from mice as well as human patients [10], [11], [21].

            "text": "The epitope of D29 was mapped using a random-peptide phage display library, an approach which has been widely used for the identification of both linear and conformational epitopes [26], [31]\u2013[34]. Two peptide phage clones, P3 (Cluster 1) and P9 (Cluster 2), displayed significant inhibition of D29 Fab-IgG binding to immobilized DENV2 by ELISA; P9 was also able to significantly block the binding of D29 Fab-IgG in a non-reducing Western blot analysis. This may be due to a better sequence match of P9 to its predicted cluster compared with P3 (Fig. 5), hence, a higher affinity of the peptide to D29 Fab-IgG. To ascertain the authenticity of the predicted epitopes, the predicted residues were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the P3 and P9 peptide sequence. The residues P56L, P58Q and P59N within the P3 epitope were found to be the principle residues involved in the interaction between prM and D29 Fab-IgG; they were also critical for the binding of m2H2, corroborating with results of competition assays. The binding for E protein was not really affected by mutation of aa residues within the P3 epitope; contrasting to the significant impact caused by mutation of 1\u20132 residues within the P9 epitope. The combined mutation of E129V, E131Q, E133E, and E134N completely abolished binding of D29 Fab-IgG to E protein, establishing the critical residues within the P9 epiotpe. Taken together, these results suggest that D29 Fab-IgG recognises two epitopes on DENV \u2013 a solvent-accessible epitope on prM as the principle binding epitope, and a cryptic epitope on E which mimics the prM epitope but is not available on a native, functionally-folded E protein. The P3 and P9 epitopes are highly conserved across the four DENV serotypes, as well as two other flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus and West nile virus; but with increasing divergence in Yellow fever virus and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (Fig. S4).",

However, as demonstrated in this study and recent reports, prM-specific antibodies are able to restore and enhance the infectivity of imDENV and partially mature DENV [9], [11], [12]; it may be worthwhile to consider alternative vaccine approaches that minimize anti-prM responses during vaccine design [9]. The findings from our study also suggest that any partial denaturation or unfolding of an E protein vaccine preparation may result in the exposure of a cryptic P9-like epitope, which has the potential to induce D29-like antibodies with threatening ADE capability.",

The similarity of D29 Fab-IgG to germline sequence suggests that such antibodies are present in the immune repertoire of na\u00efve individuals and given the inherent high affinity of D29, such antibodies may be preferentially selected during clonal expansion and maintained as memory. Indeed, antibodies that cross-react between prM and E has been isolated from memory B cells in primary and secondary dengue patients [9], [11]. The original immunogens for these cross-reactive antibodies are difficult to determine since they were generated in the course of natural infections, but it would be interesting to identify the epitope and germline of these antibodies and compare the sequences with D29 Fab-IgG.",
