However, inadequate initial epidemiological investigations sometimes lead to an inability to elucidate the causes of the spreading of infectious diseases and to establish clear disease prevention strategies as well as strategies to prevent recurrence. For timely prevention, it is necessary to find the sources and routes of infection through prompt epidemiological investigations in the initial stages of outbreak. To do this, the availability of epidemiology experts in infectious diseases and staff dedicated to infectious diseases is the most crucial factor [1]. Nevertheless, South Korea (hereafter Korea) currently lacks experienced field epidemiologists who have an adequate understanding of epidemiology of infectious diseases [2].",

The Law for the Prevention of Communicable Diseases, which was enacted as the 308th Law on February 2, 1954, established legal systems on Korea\u2019s management of infectious diseases. The law was fully enforced when the enforced ordinance for the law was enacted on February 28, 1957 [6]. As part of the Research Project on the Training and Development of Experts in Infectious Diseases and Staff for Infectious Disease Management, which was established in 1999 to conduct research on precautions against newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, the field epidemiologist system was set in place. Initially, 19 public health practitioners were selected to receive 2 weeks of introductory education and were deployed at the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH) and in each city and province; these epidemiologists were employed for 1 year for epidemiological investigations of infectious diseases. This was part of a pilot project, which employed public health practitioners who were relatively more available to effectively respond to new and reemerging infectious diseases by ensuring an available supply of experts in epidemiological investigations. In 2000, the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP), a training program focusing on field epidemiological investigations, was newly created. For the program, public health practitioners interested in epidemiology and infectious diseases were selected to become field epidemiologists who would be responsible for epidemiological investigations and surveillance of infectious diseases for at least 2 years. After 4 weeks of introductory training for field epidemiologists, the epidemiologists were deployed at the KNIH and in each city and province to conduct epidemiological investigations and surveillance of various infectious diseases [1].",

Workshops are conducted between the introductory course and on-the-job training and aim to form networks between newly appointed and experienced field epidemiologists and to promote discussions on the field epidemiologist system. The on-the-job trainings are conducted in September and March for central, municipal, and provincial field epidemiologists and for epidemiological investigation staff at quarantine centers and in each city and province. The trainings focus on epidemiological investigation cases to promote acquisition of expert knowledge in smaller projects and discussion of epidemiological investigation cases. Conferences for field epidemiologists are conducted separately during the Fall Conference for the Korean Society of Epidemiology owing to a memorandum of understanding (MOU signed with the society; these conferences aim to investigate cases of epidemiological investigation and to promote presentation and discussion of studies on the characteristics of infectious diseases [2,11].",
