DNA sequences can be represented in different dimension spaces. For example, G-curve and H-curve [1] were first proposed by Hamori and Ruskin before thirty years. Later, Gates [2] established a 2D graphical representation that was simpler than H curve. However, Gate's graphical representation has high degeneracy because of some circuits appearing in its curve. Several researchers in their recent studies have outlined different kinds of DNA sequences graphical representation based on 2D [3\u201311], 3D [12\u201315], 4D [16], 5D [17], and 6D [18]. Among these methods, we here stress DV-curve representation which was proposed by Zhang [10]. DV-curve uses two vectors to represent one alphabet of DNA sequences and avoids degeneracy and loss of information. Furthermore, DV-curve has good visualization no matter how long these sequences are and can reflect the length of the DNA sequence.",

Although protein sequences and DNA sequences belong to symbolic sequences, the methods for the graphical representation of protein sequences are relatively less popular, compared with DNA sequences. The key reason is that the extension of DNA graphical representation to protein sequences enormously increases the number of possible alternative assignments for these 20 amino acids. The amino acid sequence is the key to discover protein structure and function in the cell, so analysis of amino acid sequences is a very important part of postgenomic studies. The graphical representation study of protein sequences emerged very recently. The first visualization protein model was proposed by Randi\u0107 et al. until 2004 [19]. Some researchers have studied on graphical representation of protein sequences from different perspectives [20\u201329].",

The closer the genetic relationship is, the smaller the difference in amino acid composition between them will be. Over the past thirty years, the characteristics of protein sequences have been studied by establishing different classified models [21\u201324, 26, 27]. A well-known model of protein sequences is the hydrophobic (H or nonpolar)-hydrophilic (P or polar), that is, the HP model may be too simple and lacks enough consideration on the heterogeneity and the complexity of the natural set of residues [30]. Based on Brown's work [31], 20 different kinds of amino acids are divided into four groups: nonpolar (np), negative polar (nep), uncharged polar (up), and positive polar (pp). This is called the detailed HP model, which can provide more information than the original HP model.",

A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Previous phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments shows that SARS-CoVs come from a new group distantly related to the above three groups of previously characterized coronaviruses [41, 42].
