The feasibility of an autonomous ancient RNA genome, and the mechanisms underlying such fateful transitions, are challenging to reconstruct. It is especially unclear whether RNA entities ever evolved genomes close to the 100\u2013300 kilobase (kb) range [2, 3] of the \u201cminimal\u201d reconstructed cellular DNA genome [4]. This range overlaps with the upper size limit of nuclear pre-mRNAs [5], which is likely the upper size limit for functional RNAs due to the relative chemical lability of RNA compared to DNA. However, pre-mRNAs are incapable of self-replication, the defining property of primordial genomic RNAs.",

The same constraints may also inform research on the biology and pathogenesis of RNA virus infections, because they shape the diversity of viral proteomes and RNA elements. The causes and consequences of changes in genome size can be understood in the context of a relationship that locks replication fidelity, genome size, and complexity within a unidirectional triangle [14]. RNA viruses appear to be trapped in the low state of this relationship (Eigen trap) [15], which is characterized by low fidelity (high mutation rate), small genome size (10 kb average), and low complexity (few protein/RNA elements). Specifically, low-fidelity replication without proofreading constrains genome expansion [16], since accumulation of mutations [17] would lead to the meltdown of larger genomes during replication (error catastrophe hypothesis) [18, 19].",

These and other proteins form a membrane-bound replication-transcription complex (RTC) [43, 44] that invariably includes two key ORF1b-encoded subunits: the Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) fused to an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [45, 46], and a zinc-binding domain (ZBD) fused to a superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1), respectively [47\u201350]. The RTC catalyzes the synthesis of genomic and 3\u2019-coterminal subgenomic RNAs, the latter via discontinuous transcription that is regulated by leader and body transcription-regulating sequences (lTRS and bTRS) [51\u201353]. Subgenomic RNAs are translated to express virion and, in ExoN-positive viruses, accessory proteins encoded in the 3\u2019ORFs [23, 54\u201359]. Most nidovirus proteins are multifunctional, but some released from the N-terminus of pp1a/pp1ab and/or encoded in the 3\u2019ORFs are specialized in the modulation of virus-host interactions [26, 60\u201365].",

Extant nidovirus genomes of different sizes have reached particular points on this trajectory of genome size, apparently due to the lineage-specific interplay of poorly understood genetic and host-specific factors. A single cycle of this process can account for genome expansion from the lower end of genome sizes (12.7 kb) to the upper end (31.7 kb); expansion of genomes far beyond that size range has been hypothesized to require a second cycle, beginning with a new wave of ORF1b expansion [66]. In the absence of newly discovered RNA viruses with significantly larger genomes since the time of that analysis, and due to the unknown nature of the ORF1b size constraint(s), however, the feasibility of a second cycle has remained uncertain, and the notion that ~34 kb is close to the actual limit of RNA virus genome size [35] has seemed plausible.",

PSCNV has the largest RNA genome by a considerable margin\u2013a feat made more remarkable by the fact that its genome is organized as a single ORF. Concomitantly, it has adapted the nidoviral regulatory toolkit in novel ways, and acquired many features that revise the known limits of viral genomic and proteomic variation\u2013some of these features being unique among nidoviruses, others among RNA viruses, and still others among all known viruses.

In one specimen, membrane-bound compartments containing 90\u2013150 nm spherical-to-oblong particles resembling nidoviral nucleocapsids [74, 75] were found in the cytoplasm of mucus-secreting cells. These sub-epidermal gland cells are notable for their abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and long projections into the ventral epithelium, through which they secrete mucus (S2 Fig). These cells provide an ideal environment for nidoviral replication, which co-opts host membranes to produce viral replication complexes [76, 77]. Putative viral particles were found both in deep regions of these cells, and in their trans-epidermal projections (Fig 4A\u20134C). The latter location suggests a route for viral transmission. Notably, particles in sub-epidermal layers have a \u201chazy\u201d appearance and are embedded in a relatively electron-dense matrix (Fig 4D). In contrast, particles closer to the apical surface of the epidermis appear as relatively discrete structures, standing out against electron-lucent surrounding material (Fig 4E). The size, ultrastructure, and host-cell locations are all consistent with these structures being nidoviral nucleocapsids [74, 75].",

We delineated at least twenty domains in the PSCNV polyprotein, including twelve domains conserved in nidoviruses or other entities, using a multistage computational procedure that combined different analyses within a probabilistic framework (Fig 2; S3\u2013S16 Fig; S5 Table; see Materials and Methods). We initially identified six regions highly enriched in hydrophobic residues characteristic of transmembrane domains, named TM1 to TM6 accordingly (Fig 2). The number and relative location of the TM domains resemble those found in the proteomes of nidoviruses, which commonly have five or more TM domains in non-structural and structural proteins [82\u201385]. We then identified fourteen regions enriched in individual amino acid residues (S4 Fig), with the strongest signal observed for Thr-rich region (residues 10429\u201310559, 44.3% Thr residues, up to 13.4 SD above the mean). Notably, the Thr-rich region overlaps with a Ser-rich region (10461\u201310501 aa, 19.5% Ser residues, up to 5.5 SD above the mean). Subsequently, two tandem repeats were identified toward the N-terminus of the polyprotein (residues 1616\u20131682 and 1686\u20131751, Probability 96.6%, S5 Fig), which showed no significant similarity to other proteins in the databases using HHsearch.",

Five of these domains (3CLpro, NiRAN, RdRp, HEL1, and O-MT) were identified by hits exceeding the 95% Probability threshold, while three others were based on weaker hits: 35.0% for ZBD, 39.1% for ExoN, and 80.8% for N-MT. Despite the lower Probability values obtained for the latter three domains, synteny and conservation of essential functional residues strongly suggest that they encode true homologs of canonical nidoviral proteins. Overall, the analysis demonstrates the existence of the three definitive nidoviral genomic subregions in the PSCNV single-ORF genome: ORF1a-, ORF1b-, and 3\u2019ORFs-like. Within these regions, TM2, 3CLpro, and TM3 map to the ORF1a-like region, while NiRAN, RdRp, ZBD, HEL1, ExoN, N-MT, and O-MT map to the ORF1b-like region.",

This protease includes a catalytic domain composed of a two-barrel chymotrypsin-like fold and a C-terminal accessory domain whose fold varies among nidoviruses [86, 87]. It is flanked by two TM domains in the polyprotein (TM2 and TM3), which anchor the RTC to the membrane [43] (Fig 2). The catalytic domain of PSCNV 3CLpro was identified in the canonical position between TM2 and TM3 (S3 Fig) through hits to hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles of cellular serine proteases with chymotrypsin-like folds, while its similarity to the HMM profile of the nidovirus 3CLpro was extremely low (Probability 2.8%; see S5 Table), indicating unique properties. The long distance (~250 aa) between the C-terminus of the putative catalytic domain of PSCNV 3CLpro and the N-terminus of TM3, suggests that PSCNV 3CLpro possesses a highly divergent C-terminal domain. Unlike other characterized invertebrate nidoviruses, which all employ cysteine as the catalytic nucleophile [88, 89], PSCNV 3CLpro appears to use the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad typical of cellular chymotrypsin-like proteases (S7 Fig). PSCNV 3CLpro was also found to have a residue variation that has never been observed in 3CLpro-encoding viruses before: it encodes a Val residue in the position commonly occupied by a His residue in the putative substrate-binding pocket (GXV vs G/YXH, highlighted in bold) [42, 88\u201391].",

Mutiple sequence alignments confirm the high conservation of canonical motifs and residues in these domains (S9 and S11 Figs). The only exception concerns the RdRp C motif: a Ser residue of the nidovirus-specific SDD signature [23] is replaced by Gly in PSCNV. As in previously described nidoviruses, PSCNV\u2019s HEL1-associated ZBD includes 12 Cys or His residues that are homologous to putative Zn-binding residues (S10 Fig). The PSCNV RdRp-associated NiRAN retains six out of the seven invariant residues observed in all known nidoviruses [45] (S8 Fig). The outlier is in motif BN, in which Thr takes the place of an invariant Asp as the distal residue. In addition, the BN motif in PSCNV also contains an Asn at a highly conserved Ser/Thr position. These substitutions might represent the \u201cswapping\u201d of the two residues, assuming that the chemically similar Asp and Asn residues play an equivalent role in the respective proteins. This hypothesis is plausible, given that the two affected residues are expected to be in close proximity to each other, separated only by an incomplete turn of the putative alpha-helix of the motif BN (S8 Fig). Another notable feature of the PSCNV NiRAN is the large distance between invariant Lys and Glu residues of the motif AN: 20 aa in PSCNV compared to 5\u20139 aa in other nidoviruses. The conservation of NiRAN and ZBD in PSCNV is significant for assignment of this virus to the nidoviruses, since both domains are the only known genetic markers of the order Nidovirales.",

Like its orthologs, the PSCNV ExoN contains the characteristic D-E-D-H-D pentad, which includes counterparts of catalytic and other active site residues. The H-D subset is embedded within a highly conserved domain, whose structure is maintained by two Cys and two His residues coordinating a Zn2+ in characterized nidoviruses. However, these residues are substituted in PSCNV (H-C-H-C by E-S-Q-Q), which may therefore lack this Zn-finger (S12 Fig). In this respect, PSCNV ExoN is more similar to its cellular homologs than to those of nidoviruses (S5 Table). In contrast, the ExoNs of all ExoN-positive nidoviruses, including PSCNV, include another (upstream) Zn-finger, which distinguishes them from related enzymes of other origins. The N-MT and O-MT are implicated in viral RNA capping machinery [31, 92, 95\u2013100]. In both transferases, a number of residues crucial for substrate and ligand binding are conserved in PSCNV homologs, including Zn-binding residues of N-MT (S13 Fig), and the catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad of O-MT (S14 Fig). Notably, like ExoN, O-MT is conserved in all nidoviruses with genomes >20 kb.",

The cellular domains clustered together in a phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary relationship between these proteins and the PSCNV ANK using BEAST software (LG+G4 model, relaxed clock with uncorrelated log-normal rate distribution) (Fig 6). The topology of this tree implies that an ancestor of PSCNV acquired a host ANK domain prior to the divergence of the S. mediterranea and D. lacteum lineages, but we cannot exclude an alternative explanation in which viral ANK repeats experienced accelerated evolution compared to host sequences that was not evident in our analysis.",

In nidoviruses, the TM domains encoded in the 3\u2019-genome region are known to be part of the S and M proteins or their equivalents, and occasionally additional accessory proteins [14, 58, 59, 106, 109]. The extracellular portion of the S protein is supported by multiple disulfide bridges between conserved Cys residues [56]. In PSCNV, a Cys-rich region was observed downstream of TM5 (S4 Fig). In an approximately 650 aa region surrounding the TM6 domain (4.7% of the polyprotein length), we identified six areas enriched in Pro, Leu, Gly, Gln, Asn, or Arg, in close proximity to each other (S4 Fig). This region accounted for 43% of all residue-enriched areas in the polyprotein; such an exceptionally high concentration of sequences enriched with specific amino acids is indicative of unusual properties. Accordingly, this area was predicted to include the longest stretch of disordered regions. In nidoviruses, disordered hydrophilic-rich areas are characteristic of N proteins.",

We reasoned that this part of its polyprotein might be processed by cellular signal peptidase (SPase) and/or furin to produce several proteins, as documented for maturation of the structural proteins of many RNA viruses, including nidoviruses [110\u2013114]. Indeed, our analysis of potential cleavage sites of these proteases revealed highly uneven distributions (S4 Fig), with sites predicted only in the N- and C-terminal parts of the polyprotein: 1400\u20133100 aa (one SPase and four furin sites) and 10200\u201313200 aa (three SPase and five furin sites). All of these are outside of the region that must be processed by 3CLpro. With the exception of the most C-terminal furin site, all predicted sites are in close vicinity to provisional borders of the domains described above, as would be expected if these domains function as distinct proteins. Specifically, if the predicted SPase and furin sites are cleaved, TM1, TM4, TM5, and TM6 would end up in separate proteins, with one protein including the TM4 and ANK domains. With predicted cleavage sites flanking it from both sides, TM5 may be released as a separate protein, most similar to M proteins in size and hydrophobicity. We also note that two putative proteins may combine a FN2 module with a disordered region: FN2a with a Thr/Ser-rich region and FN2b with the Pro/Leu/Gly/Gln/Asn/Arg-rich region, respectively. Based on the reasoning outlined above, the latter combination may constitute a region of the N protein.",

To resolve very deep branching, we used an outgroup in our analysis, and selected astroviruses for this purpose [23]. Astroviruses [115] and nidoviruses share multi-ORF genome organization, a central role for 3CLpro in polyprotein processing, and similarities in the RdRp domain. Conversely, astroviruses do not encode a HEL1, NiRAN or ZBD, and their 3CLpro is highly divergent. Given the divergent 3CLpro of PSCNV, RdRp remained as the only domain most suitable for phylogeny reconstruction; this domain has been used in many studies on macroevolution of nidoviruses [21, 23, 35, 116].",

The top prediction identified nucleotide 18512 as a putative PRF site. This nucleotide is positioned 240 nt upstream of the region encoding the NiRAN AN motif, and the free energy of the downstream pseudoknot is -16.2 kcal/mol (Fig 9, right).

As a result of -1 PRF at the identified PSCNV site, translation would shift from the main PSCNV ORF to a small 39-nt ORF. If -1 PRF at this site indeed occurs in a fraction of translation events of the ORF1a-like region, translation of the ORF1b-like region (and also 3\u2019ORFs-like region) will be attenuated, with a net result that should be similar to that of other nidoviruses: proteins encoded in the ORF1a-like region will be expressed in higher quantities than proteins encoded in the ORF1b-like region.",

Since these 22 nucleotides of bTRS are identical to those of the lTRS, the latter might alternatively form a stable secondary structure with the yellow region (upstream of bTRS; Fig 10C). The basal part of the hairpin is much smaller and may not be conserved in the possible interaction involving lTRS.",

We identified six contig sequences with highly significant similarity to PSCNV indicative of at least two nidoviruses (S18 Fig). These contigs originate from transcriptomes of S. mediterranea (uc_Smed_v2 and ox_Smed_v2 assemblies, two and one contigs, respectively; the latter contig was excluded from consideration due to being almost identical to one of the former contigs) and another planarian species, Planaria torva (dd_Ptor_v3 assembly, three contigs). Translations of the two uc_Smed_v2 contigs of 814 nt and 1839 nt gave hits of >99% aa identity to the very C-terminus of PSCNV polyprotein, indicative of a variant of PSCNV circulating in the same host species (see section above). In contrast, the dd_Ptor_v3 transcriptome included two short contigs (283 nt and 289 nt) with hits to the PSCNV RdRp domain (38 and 48% aa identity) as well as an 8811-nt contig, whose translation in the +1 frame gave 3 discontinuous hits, one to the O-MT domain of the ORF1b-like region (37% aa identity) and two to the 3\u2019ORFs-like region and its FN2b domain (25% and 37% aa identity). These domains are separated by different distances in PSCNV and the 8811-nt contig. It is notable that all three hits from the P. torva contig correspond to its translation in the same frame, uninterrupted by stop-codons, suggesting that ORF1b-like and 3\u2019ORFs-like regions of this putative and divergent virus could also be expressed from a single ORF.",

These were identified with high statistical confidence, using an iterative bioinformatics procedure with profile searches at its core. These domains include the definitive nidovirus markers NiRAN and ZBD, and all ten are syntenic between PSCNV and other nidoviruses. Most are located in the ORF1b-like (replicase) region, which also includes four subregions left unannotated (Fig 2). Of these unannotated subregions, one flanked by ZBD and HEL1 may correspond to the regulatory domain 1B, which is uniformly present but poorly conserved in helicases of nidoviruses [48, 49], while the other three may represent domains uniquely acquired by a PSCNV ancestor. Like all characterized invertebrate nidoviruses, but unlike most vertebrate nidoviruses [14, 129], PSCNV does not encode a homolog of an uridylate-specific endonuclease (NendoU) [31]. Accordingly, our rooted RdRp-based phylogenetic analysis assigned PSCNV to a monophyletic clade of invertebrate nidoviruses. Another topologically similar tree was inferred using five nidovirus-wide conserved domains with a dataset that did not include an outgroup. The observed tree topology is also broadly compatible with other observations of this study (see below), and with RdRp-based trees of known nidoviruses produced in other studies [14, 21, 35]. Given that PSCNV infects planarian hosts, consistent placement of this virus in the invertebrate nidovirus clade by different analyses makes biological sense. On the other hand, the precise position of PSCNV in the invertebrate nidovirus clade remains poorly resolved for several reasons, including the highly skewed host representation in the analyzed small sample of 57 nidoviruses, and the large divergence of invertebrate nidoviruses from each other.",

The replacement of the otherwise invariant His by Val in the putative substrate pocket is indicative of a modified P1 substrate specificity for this enzyme, which exhibits a strong preference for Glu or Gln residues in P1 position in most other ssRNA+ viruses, including vertebrate nidoviruses [42, 88\u201391]. Accordingly, we were unable to identify typical 3CLpro cleavage sites at the expected inter-domain borders in the portion of the PSCNV polyprotein that must be processed by 3CLpro. Furthermore, the nucleophilic catalytic residue of PSCNV\u2019s 3CLpro is Ser, while its counterpart in other characterized invertebrate nidoviruses is Cys. Similar variation of this residue has been described among vertebrate arteri- and toroviruses versus coronaviruses [42, 88\u201391], with distinct variants being associated with deeply separated virus lineages at the rank of (sub)family. Diversification of the nucleophile residue was also observed in other ssRNA+ viruses that employ 3C(L) proteases [132, 133]. This recurrent Ser-Cys toggling of the catalytic nucleophile in other well-established viral families argues against independent origins of 3CLpros in PSCNV and other nidoviruses, despite their weak sequence similarity.",

We reasoned otherwise, however, on the grounds that these mechanisms allow differential expression of three functionally different regions of the nidovirus genome, which are also conserved in PSCNV. We located a potential -1 PRF signal in the PSCNV genome. This signal is located at the canonical position observed in other nidoviruses, and could potentially attenuate in-frame translation downstream of the ORF1a-like region in a manner different from a mechanism used by other characterized nidoviruses, but with similar end-products (Fig 9).

The latter step is considered routine in the current model of sg RNA synthesis in well-characterized arteriviruses and coronaviruses [51, 135]. However, its mechanistic details are poorly understood and may operate differently among nidovirus families.",

DNA polydnaviruses and RNA pestiviruses are the only two other virus groups that are known to encode related enzymes [139, 140]. In pestiviruses, the RNase T2 homolog is a domain of secreted glycoprotein Erns found in virions, but dispensable for virus entry [141]. The Erns structure is supported by four disulfide bridges that are formed by eight conserved Cys residues [139]. None of these residues were found in the PSCNV RNase T2 homolog, consistent with its location in the polyprotein region that produces cytoplasmic proteins in other nidoviruses. In polydnaviruses and pestiviruses, the RNase T2 homolog modulates cell toxicity and immunity [139, 140], and a similar role could be considered for the PSCNV RNase T2 homolog. The origin of this domain in PSCNV remains uncertain due to the lack of close homologs in either its host, S. mediterranea, or other cellular and viral species.",

Because of the low similarity of FN2a and FN2b to each other and other homologs, it is not clear whether they emerged by duplication or were acquired independently. No other known virus encodes an FN2 homolog (although the putative nidovirus identified in P. torva may include an ortholog of FN2b, S18 Fig), suggesting that PSCNV\u2019s FN2 domains function in a unique aspect of its replication cycle. FN2 domains are known to possess collagen-binding activity, and are found in a variety of proteins that bind to and remodel the extracellular matrix [144, 145]. Thus, it is conceivable that these domains might play a role in the shedding or transmission of PSCNV virions. This hypothesis is compatible with the accumulation of PSCNV RNA and particles, presumably virions, in the planarian mucus-secreting cells. Besides FN2 domains, this process might also involve the Thr/Ser-rich region adjacent to FN2a in polyprotein, since Thr-rich and Thr/Ser-rich regions have been implicated in mediating adherence of fungal and bacterial extracellular (glyco) proteins to various substrates [146, 147].",

            "text": "The identification of the ankyrin repeats domain (ANK) in PSCNV is unprecedented and intriguing. In proteins of other origins, the ANK domain is a tandem array of ankyrin repeat motifs (~33 residues each) of variable number and divergence that fold together to form a protein-binding interface [148]. Ankyrin-containing proteins are involved in a wide range of functions in all three domains of cellular life. In viruses described to date, they have been identified exclusively in large DNA viruses with genome sizes ranging from ~100 kb to 2474 kb, the latter of Pandoravirus salinus, the largest viral genome described so far [38, 148\u2013150]. Acquisition of this domain, likely from a planarian host, might have provided a PSCNV ancestor with a mechanism to evade host innate immunity. Notably, according to SmedGB [102] annotation, host proteins SMU15016868 and SMU15005918, whose C-terminal domains are the closest homologs of PSCNV ANK (Fig 6), contain a Rel homology domain (RHD) at their N-termini. This N-RHD-ANK-C domain architecture is typical of the NF-\u0138B protein, a precursor of a cellular transcription factor that triggers inflammatory immune responses upon virus infection or other cell stimulation [151]. NF-\u0138B is activated for translocation to the nucleus by degradation of its inhibitor, C-terminal ANK domain of NF-\u0138B protein or its closely related paralog, I\u0138B protein [148, 152, 153]. Several large DNA viruses have been shown to encode I\u0138B-mimicking proteins that prevent NF-\u0138B from entering the nucleus in response to the infection, and thus downregulate the host immune response [154, 155]. PSCNV ANK may represent the first example of an I\u0138B-mimicking protein in RNA viruses, although RNA viruses including nidoviruses can target NF-\u0138B protein using other mechanisms [156]. This striking parallel between PSCNV and large DNA viruses blurs the distinction between these viruses regarding how they adapt to hosts [157]. It further highlights the exceptional coding capacity of PSCNV genome among RNA viruses.",

In this respect, determining whether the putative nidovirus we identified in P. torva also employs a single-ORF organization could be illuminating. An evolutionary switch between multi- and single-ORF organizations, regardless of its direction, must be a multi-step process, since it affects many translation regulatory signals. In our study, we used a simple model of this process with two character states within a Bayesian phylogenetic framework, to obtain support for the single-ORF organization of PSCNV emerging from the multi-ORF organization. This approach is apparently not sensitive to the choice of domains used for phylogeny reconstruction, or inclusion of an outgroup. However, given the deep position of the PSCNV lineage in the nidovirus tree, the ambiguous rooting of PSCNV relative to other invertebrate nidovirus families, and PSCNV being the only single-ORF nidovirus known, further analysis of this transition using improved sampling of nidoviruses and their sister clades [35, 36], and more sophisticated models is warranted.",

This observation is in line with the inverse relationship between genome size and mutation rate in viruses and prokaryotes [160, 161]. Accordingly, we may expect mutation rates to differ among ExoN-containing nidoviruses with different genome sizes, with PSCNV having a particularly low mutation rate. While characterization of mutation rates of PSCNV and other nidoviruses must await future studies, we already note a distinctive similarity between cellular proofreading exonucleases and ExoN of PSCNV, which separates it from its orthologs in other ExoN-positive nidoviruses. Specifically, there is a correlation between the presence of the Zn-finger motif in the exonuclease active site [33, 92] and the genome size of the biological entity encoding the exonuclease: non-PSCNV nidoviruses with genome sizes in the range of 20\u201334 kb include a Zn-finger embedding catalytic His, while PSCNV and DNA-based entities with genome sizes >41 kb do not (S12 Fig) [162]. Based on these observations, it is plausible that this Zn-finger might limit ExoN's capacity to improve replication fidelity while providing other benefits, and its loss in the PSCNV lineage could have been a factor promoting genome expansion.",

            "text": "Besides the lack of the Zn-finger in ExoN, the reported size increase of the ORF1b-like region in PSCNV relative to other nidoviruses (about 10-fold greater than expected under an assumption of uniform expansion in all genome subregions) is particularly notable in the context of the theoretical framework presented in the introduction. Briefly, expansion of RNA genomes requires escape from the so-called Eigen trap (or Eigen paradox): such genomes are confined to a low-size state, in which low replication fidelity prevents the evolution of larger genomes, which in turn prevents the evolution of greater complexity, which could introduce tools to increase replication fidelity [15]. The three-wave model of genome expansion in nidoviruses notes that the ORF1b region, which encodes the core replicative machinery, appears to play a central role in such constraints. It proposes that a wave of expansion in the ORF1b region of a common ancestor precedes and permits subsequent lineage-specific waves in the ORF1a and 3\u2019ORFs subregions. The wave of expansion in ORF1b involved the acquisition of the ExoN proofreading exonuclease, which permitted further expansion of other subregions due to a reduced mutation rate. Until now, however, the genomes of large nidoviruses (the 20-to-34 kb size range) appeared to have reached a plateau at the low-30 kb range, associated with very little variability in the size of ORF1b among members of this group (6.9-to-8.2 kb). The three-wave model predicts that further genome expansion far beyond 34 kb would require a second cycle of waves, beginning again with ORF1b [66]. The disproportionate increase in PSCNV\u2019s ORF1b-like region is consistent with this prediction. The acquisition of additional, still-uncharacterized domains in this region of the PSCNV genome, as well as the distinctive features of its ExoN domain, may help to explain this \u201csecond escape\u201d from the Eigen trap. Further characterization of the PSCNV ExoN and novel ORF1b domains are required, to assess their contribution to replication fidelity and other characteristics that may be critical for faithful replication and expression of exceptionally large RNA genomes.",

Thus, nidoviruses of yet-to-be-sampled hosts might prove to have evolved even larger RNA genomes than that reported here, further decreasing the gap between virus RNA and host DNA genome sizes.",

With E-value cut-off 10, 25 S. mediterranea transcripts were identified and used in reciprocal BLAST searches against the NCBI NR database. Two nested transcripts, txv3.2-contig_1447 (assembled from sexual planarians, GenBank BK010449) and txv3.1-contig_12746 (assembled from asexual planarians, GenBank BK010448), showed statistically significant similarity to other nidoviruses, which exceeded its similarity to other entries. Sequences of these two transcripts overlap by 23,529 nt with only 7 nt mismatches (0.03%). The larger transcript, txv3.1-contig_12746, was used to search in planarian EST clones [69, 164], which found the following overlapping clones showing >99% nucleotide identity: PL06016B2F06, PL06005B2C04. PL06007A2B12, PL06008B2B03 PL08002B1C07, and PL08001B2B04 (GenBank DN313906.1, DN309834.1, DN310382.1, DN310925.1, HO005314.1, and HO005110.1, respectively). Transcripts txv3.1-contig_12746 and txv3.2-contig_1447, and the six EST clones were assembled into an incomplete putative genome. Conflicts between overlapping sequences were always resolved in favor of the txv3.1-contig_12746 sequence. Fifteen 3\u2019-terminal nt of the reverse complement of txv3.1-contig_12746 (\u201cTATTATGTGATACAC\u201d) and two 3\u2019-terminal nt of HO005314.1 and HO005110.1 (\u201cTG\u201d) were discarded due to their likely technical origin. The assembled sequence contains a stop codon followed by a short untranslated region and a polyadenylated (polyA) tail. The planarian transcriptomes were surveyed again for transcripts with >50 nt overlap at the 5\u2019-end of the incomplete genome by consecutive rounds of nucleotide BLAST. This identified txv3.1-contig_349344 (from asexual planarians; 11,647 nt; 100-nt overlap with txv3.1-contig_12746 with no mismatches; GenBank BK010447) upstream of the original transcripts, and no further extension was achieved with more BLAST iterations. The 5\u2019-end of the genome was then extended using 5\u2019-RACE followed by Sanger sequencing (primers in S2 Table).",
