Local and systemic inflammation, however, can impair endothelial function and can lead to cellular damage increasing endothelial permeability and loss of epithelial barrier function [1], [2]. Endogenous RNA release and circulating RNA like virus\u2013associated double stranded RNA (dsRNA) may contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial cells express toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) [3] which is activated by dsRNA [4], [5]. The activation of TLR3 affects cell homeostasis [6], [7] and causes changes at functional [8], [9], as well as inflammatory gene expression level [10]. At cellular level, dsRNA induces a signaling cascade [11], [12] leading to TLR3 receptor upregulation [4], [13]. At organ level, repeated and long-term administration of synthetic dsRNA causes inflammation [14], [15] and leads to impairment of lung function in mice [16]\u2013[18]. However, the biological activity of circulating extracellular RNA is poorly understood.",

            "text": "Recently, an extracellular RNA-induced activation of VEGF has been shown, leading to increased permeability of cerebral endothelial cells, which are the main components of the blood brain barrier [19]. This hyperpermeability can occur due to exposure of the cells to total RNA [8] or the synthetic analogue of dsRNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) [20] and can lead to disintegration of adherens junctions [21]. Endothelial permeability regulation [22] and function [23], [24] is a Ca2+-dependent process [1], [25]. A rise in intracellular Ca2+ in the ECs occurs through Ca2+ influx or by release from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SER) resulting in plasma membrane-located Ca2+ channel activation [26], [27]. To maintain the Ca2+ homeostasis of the cell, the Ca2+ stores are refilled by the SER-membrane-located sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) [28]. SERCA is encoded by three homologous genes: SERCA1, SERCA2 and SERCA3 [29], out of these in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs) only SERCA2 and SERCA3 isoforms are expressed [30], [31]. However, SERCA plays an important role not only in the Ca2+ homeostasis [24], [30], [32], but it is vital for cell cycle control [33], proliferation and regulation of cellular permeability as well.",

Viral RNA has been identified as a pathogenic factor in different pulmonary diseases [39], [40]. Circulating RNA may lead to pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and thus to increased endothelial permeability [8]. The precise mechanism by which circulating RNA induces endothelial barrier disruption in the lung has not been completely understood yet. The present study addressed novel pathways of dsRNA effect on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs). Our data showed that natural dsRNA treatment significantly decreased electric resistance indicating disruption in the hPAEC monolayer integrity. A similar effect could be observed with the widely used synthetic dsRNA-analog, Poly I:C. Incubation with \u039b-DNA did not cause significant permeability changes indicating the specificity of the dsRNA effect. As dsRNA and Poly I:C treatment mimics viral infection, our results are in line with previous observations on bluetongue virus-infected human primary microvascular endothelial cells [41]. The EC monolayer disrupting effect of dsRNA was further confirmed by using fluorescently labeled dextran trafficking, showing that stimulation with either Poly I:C, total RNA or dsRNA resulted in an increase in transferred dextran amount suggesting a significant loss in endothelial barrier function.",

The major component for the maintenance of monolayer integrity belongs to the transmembrane protein family, the cadherins [21]. The vascular endothelial cells express in their membrane the vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) member of this family. Poly I:C incubation decreased VE-cadherin signal, pointing to disrupted cell-cell contacts in the monolayer. A similar decrease was reported as a result of dengue-2 virus infection in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [21]. We observed a similar decrease in the ZO-1 protein upon Poly I:C treatment. Furthermore, our results indicate that not only the junctional proteins contribute to dissociation of intercellular contacts, but also the actin reorganization. The Poly I:C treated cells presented with an intense peripheral actin staining accompanied by cellular shape changes visible on the immunofluorescent pictures. Similar cytoskeletal rearrangement was shown to be induced by 6 h bluetongue virus infection in primary human microvascular endothelial cells [41]. Although, the authors report on a recovery of both electrical resistance and actin/VE-cadherin staining after 24 h, this was not the case in either dsRNA, or Poly I:C treatment in our experiments. This could be explained by the differences between the human lung microvascular and arterial endothelial cells.",

It has been shown that the TLR3 - PI3-Kinase pathway could be involved in the dsRNA induced signalling [42]. Indeed, we observed an upregulation of the TLR3 receptor upon Poly I:C treatment. The block of PI3-Kinase resulted in increased hPAEC permeability, decreased proliferation and disruption of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 staining. On primary hPAECs, the blocking was additive to the effect of Poly I:C, pointing to a PI3-Kinase independent mechanism of action. However, others report that PI3-Kinase is involved in dsRNA signalling [42]. In their study, a mammalian heterologuos expression system (HEK293) was used with a higher concentration of Poly I:C. We could confirm the inhibitory effect of PI3-kinase on SERCA expression, as it was previously reported with a PI3-kinase inhibitor on SERCA dependent calcium handling [43]. However, the effect on downregulation of both isoforms was additive pointing to a PI3-Kinase independent mechanism of action, similar to the effects we observed on hPAECs permeability and proliferation.",

Endothelial barrier-disruptive agents have been reported to cause changes in cytoskeletal mechanics of hPAECs [44]. In our AFM images, cells treated with Poly I:C showed an elongated morphological shape. Furthermore, the Poly I:C treatment also led to an approximately 10-fold stiffening of the cells. This is in line with the observations of the effect of other barrier-disruptive agents on hPAECs [44], [45].

Our data suggest that, beside structural changes, Poly I:C and dsRNA also affects endothelial Ca2+ homeostasis. Acute administration of either Poly I:C, or dsRNA did not result in any Ca2+ response, but 24 hours of treatment led to a significantly prolonged histamine-induced Ca2+ response, without affecting the basal Ca2+ level. Further, we focused on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. The key player of the Ca2+ store refilling is the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) [28] and its proper regulation is vital for normal cell function [33]. An inhibitory effect of Poly I:C on SERCA is suggested by the increased duration of the histamine-induced signal, observed in the presence and absence of extracellullar Ca2+. We observed a decrease in the phospholamban phosphorylation upon Poly I:C or dsRNA treatment, which contributes to enhanced block of SERCA function. Phospholamban is a negative regulator of SERCA function [46]. Phospholamban phosphorylation causes its dissociation from SERCA and removes inhibition [47].",

SERCA dysfunction has been also reported following exposure of pancreatic beta cells to cytokines [48]. However, in our experiments not only the function, but also the expression of SERCA decreased upon Poly I:C treatment, which could result in disturbance of cell cycle regulation [33]. Exposure of hPAECs to Poly I:C in fact disturbed the regular cell cycle. Furthermore, a dose and time-dependent accumulation of hPAECs in the G1-phase was observed. This increase was accompanied by decrease in the number of cells both, in S and in G2/M phase, indicating that the cell cycle is arrested. In addition, Poly I:C treatment resulted in inhibition of proliferation, with no increase in apoptosis (Figure S2, Methods S1). As the Ca2+ homeostasis of the cells was altered through affecting the SERCA pump but without change in apoptosis, we conclude that Poly I:C causes Ca2+ mishandling, due to SERCA downregulation and functional inhibition, thereby leading to G1 arrest and finally to inhibition of hPAEC proliferation.",
