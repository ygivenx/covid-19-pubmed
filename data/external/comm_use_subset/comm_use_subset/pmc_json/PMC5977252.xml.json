            "text": "Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process in which long-lived cytoplasmic components or damaged organelles are sequestered through the formation of double-membraned autophagosomes. Mature autophagosomes ultimately fuse with lysosomes to form single-membraned autophagolysosomes that degrade or recycle their contents [11]. Upon autophagy initiation, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is converted from LC3-I to the lipidated LC3-II and anchored to the autophagic membrane. The punctate distribution of LC3-II is considered a marker of autophagy induction, and it is closely related to the accumulation of autophagosomes [12]. Lipidated LC3-II usually interacts with p62, which is a multifunctional protein that is degraded by the autophagic-lysosome pathway. The occurrence of complete autophagic flux is commonly reflected in the expression of LC3-II and p62 [13]. The regulatory mechanisms mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and autophagy-related protein Beclin-1 are confirmed to play crucial functions in the autophagy progress [13,14,15].",

Under these circumstances, autophagy is employed by host cells to ensure the survival of infected cells by removing damaged organelles and maintaining cellular homeostasis, as demonstrated by herpes simplex virus type-1(HSV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [17,18]. However, some single-stranded RNA viruses, such as dengue virus [19], coxsackievirus, and hepatitis C virus, develop an escape mechanism that evades the monitoring and protective functions of autophagy induced by host cells [19,20,21]. Meanwhile, some viruses take advantage of autophagy instead to benefit their own replication, and this has been demonstrated by several members of the Flavivirus genus [22]. ZIKV infection of human fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs) was found to cause inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway, leading to defective neurogenesis and aberrant activation of autophagy [23]. Another group discovered that secretory autophagy may facilitate ZIKV transfer across the placental barrier, and regulations to the equilibrium between degradative autophagy and secretory autophagy may influence the incidence of microcephaly [24]. Further studies demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy limits vertical transmission of Zika virus in pregnant mice [25], which corresponded with the previous work. ",

To determine whether the autophagic response of HUVEC is also triggered by ZIKV infection, a reporter construct named mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 was used. This tandem-tag reporter construct enables the detection of autophagic flux. The low-pH of lysosomes quenches the green signal and therefore puncta that are only red suggests autolysosomes, whereas puncta that appears red and green, or yellow when merged, indicate autophagosomes [32]. HUVEC were infected with lentivirus expressing mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 for 48 h, and were then infected with ZIKV at an MOI = 1 for 24 h. Mock or infected cells were observed under confocal microscopy to verify the activation of the autophagy machinery. Compared with mock-infected cells, the amount of fluorescent LC3 puncta noticeably increased in ZIKV-infected cells. However, a largely dispersed fluorescence distribution was observed in the cytoplasm of mock-infected cells (Figure 1A). Further quantitative analysis indicated that the number of cells with fluorescent LC3 dot formation increased during ZIKV infection. We also observed an increase in fluorescent LC3 puncta and an increase in the number of fluorescent cells with dot formation in cells treated with an autophagosome inducer, rapamycin (Figure 1B).",

The LC3-II/GAPDH ratio was then calculated to reflect autophagy activity. The conversion of endogenous LC3-I to LC3-II was monitored at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-ZIKV infection at an MOI of 1. Rapamycin treatment of HUVEC increased the conversion to LC3-II, and it was used as a positive control. As demonstrated in Figure 1C, ZIKV-infected HUVEC had substantial LC3-I to LC3-II conversion in the late stages of infection. To quantify these results, band intensity was measured by densitometry analysis. The densitometry ratio of LC3-II to GAPDH was increased at 18 h and 24 h in ZIKV-infected cells when compared to the mock-infected cells (Figure 1D). Comigration of LC3-II in infected cells and in cells treated with rapamycin confirmed that the band was authentic LC3-II. Additionally, similar results were obtained in ZIKV-infected cells at MOIs of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 (Figure 1E). Correspondingly, we detected a significant increase in the expression of LC3-II in ZIKV-infected cells by 18 h post-infection (hpi), and it was maintained until at least 36 hpi. (Figure 1E,F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that ZIKV infection induced an autophagic response in HUVEC.",

Wort inhibits autophagy in the early stages by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. CQ acts as an autophagic inhibitor during the late stages, because it causes accumulation of sequestered material in either autophagosomes or autolysosomes [34]. As shown in Figure 3A,B, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was reduced in Wort-treated HUVEC when compared to the control cells. Additionally, titers of viral progeny were noticeably reduced in Wort-treated cells, with a ~1.70-fold reduction occurring at both 14 and 18 hpi. Surprisingly, the expression of viral NS3 protein was not correspondingly decreased (Figure 3A). CQ treatment significantly increased the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in ZIKV-infected cells, and the expression of viral NS3 protein at 18 and 24 hpi was decreased. The yields of extracellular virus were decreased 6.51-fold at 18 hpi and 3.68-fold at 24 hpi (Figure 3E,F). Furthermore, both Wort and CQ treatment reduced the extracellular yields of ZIKV progeny (Figure 3D,H). The indicated concentrations of drugs did not affect the cell viability. These data from pharmacological experiments demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy, especially at late stages, reduces ZIKV production in HUVEC.",

Our data demonstrated an increase in the amount and distribution of LC3 fluorescent spots in ZIKV-infected HUVEC by confocal microscopy, indicating autophagy formation. The ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH band density increased at different time points (18, 24, and 36 h) after infections with different MOIs of ZIKV (Figure 1). This indicates that the conversion of LC3-I to lipidated LC3-II increases with increasing infection duration. In addition, the expression level of p62 was reduced starting at 12 h after ZIKV infection. GFP signals are susceptible to acidic conditions, but RFP is relatively stable [32]. Thus, yellow punctate dots (both red and green) indicate immature autophagosomes, and red dots indicate mature autolysosomes after fusion with lysosome. Increased autophagy was indicated after ZIKV infection by double-labeled fluorescence of LC3 (Figure 2). These observations suggest that ZIKV infection likely induces complete autophagy in HUVEC. However, whether ZIKV infection induces autophagy in other cell lines needs to be further investigated.",

By suppressing autophagy with wortmannin or chloroquine, we found a reduction in the yields of progeny virus. Additionally, we found that chloroquine treatment also reduced the synthesis of viral NS3 protein (Figure 3). In the case of Wort treatment, the expression of viral NS3 protein was not decreased significantly. It suggests that progeny virus formation is affected, rather than viral replication, upon the Wort treatment. However, Wort is not a specific inhibitor of the autophagosome, because it inhibits both class I and III PI3K [34,37]. Thus, we next assessed the effect of endogenous Beclin-1 on viral replication and production. As a core part of the class III PI3K (PI3K-III) lipid kinase complex, Beclin-1 is a key autophagic gene that plays a critical role in membrane trafficking and restructuring involved in cellular autophagy. As expected, knockdown of Beclin-1 significantly reduced both the expression of viral NS3 protein and the progeny virus titer when compared to the control (Figure 4). These results indicate that significant changes in ZIKV production result from the manipulation of host autophagy pathways by drug compounds or ATGs-specific RNA interference. They also suggest that ZIKV partially adopts the action of Beclin-1, which is required for the protective functions of autophagy, to benefit their own replication.",

Although the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II increased following rapamycin treatment in infected HUVEC, viral NS3 protein expression and the progeny virus titer were not increased significantly when compared with the control group without rapamycin pretreatment (Figure 5). These results are in agreement with previous studies performed in HCV and Andes virus (ANDV). Their results showed that rapamycin, or its analogue temsirolimus, inhibited HCV and ANDV replication in Huh-7.5 cells and primary human microvascular endothelial cells, respectively [42,43]. Treatment with rapamycin led to a reduction in the expression of several important viral proteins, and it even reduced virion release but not virus entry.

As a serine/threonine protein kinase, mTOR is one of the key regulators of the class I PI3K pathway, and it has a negative effect on the formation of autophagy [45,46]. Class I PI3K is a traditional upstream activator of mTOR. A previous study reported that ZIKV NS4A and NS4B proteins caused human fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs) nerve damage and induced autophagy by inhibiting the host Akt-mTOR signal transduction. This indicates that autophagy induced by ZIKV infection is regulated by the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [23]. In the current study, rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, triggered cellular autophagy, but it did not significantly promote viral protein expression and progeny virion production. This suggests that other regulators or mechanisms are involved in the ZIKV-infected HUVEC. Considering the role of mTOR signaling in HCV and ANDV replication, our data suggest that both the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and the class III PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway are likely to be involved in the regulation of autophagy triggering in ZIKV-infected HUVEC. Different mechanisms of autophagy triggering in various cell types cannot be excluded, and the molecular mechanism of ZIKV pathogenesis in different cell types requires further clarification.",

GAPDH was used as a protein loading control; (B) The ratios of NS3 to GAPDH were calculated and representative results are presented with graphs. Data are presented as means from three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01; (C) Extracellular virus yields were determined and expressed as pfu/mL. Data are presented as means \u00b1 SDs for triplicate assays. ** p < 0.01.",
