            "text": "We have shown that the HIV-1 LTR promoter can fold into three mutually exclusive G4s and that nucleolin, the most abundant nucleolar protein, can bind, induce and stabilize the LTR G4s22. We reasoned that other proteins may exist that regulate the G4/ds equilibrium at the LTR: we thus looked for additional proteins by pull-down assay of 293T nuclear cell extracts against the whole region in the HIV-1 LTR that can fold into G4, i.e. LTR-II + III + IV. This region can alternatively fold into three G4s, i.e. LTR-II, LTR-III and LTR-IV. As control, a two-point mutation LTR-II + III + IV oligonucleotide, which has been previously shown to be unable to fold into G4, i.e. LTR-II + III + IV M4 + 5, was used (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table S1)18. After washing at increasing ionic strength to destabilize weak protein-G4 interactions, the final eluted sample was run on SDS-PAGE and subjected to MS analysis. A series of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) were found to be present only in the G4-folded oligonucleotide (Table 1); among them, only hnRNP A2/B1 was obtained in all three independent tests, even if it did not obtain the highest score within each experiments (Fig. 1b). The identity and selectivity of hnRNP A2/B1 was confirmed by pull-down assay followed by western blot analysis with an anti-hnRNP A2/B1 antibody. The G4-folded LTR-II + III + IV was used along with the G-rich non-G4 forming LTR-II + III + IV M4 + 5 and a random oligonucleotide of the same length (Supplementary Table S1). The hnRNP A2/B1 protein was confirmed to bind mainly to the G4-folded sequence, even if in these settings it displayed mild recognition also of the G-rich non-G4-folding oligonucleotide (Fig. 1c). To confirm selectivity toward the G4 LTR oligonucleotide, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed. The recombinant purified hnRNP A2, which lacks 12 amino acids in the amino-terminal region and is the main isoform, accounting for ~90% of the protein in most tissues27, was immobilized on a SPR chip and binding affinity of the unlabelled oligonucleotides was measured. LTR-II + III + IV displayed the highest KD (19.5 \u00b1 1.5 nM), while the mutant LTR-II + III + IV M4 + 5 was bound with a lower affinity (KD 35.5 \u00b1 3.0 nM). Chi2 and U-values were <10 and <15, respectively, indicating optimal data fitting2829. In contrast, binding to a random oligonucleotide of the same length as LTR-II + III + IV was so low that in these conditions it was not possible to obtain a meaningful KD value (Fig. 2).",

In the presence of 100 mM K+, stop sites corresponding to formation of LTR-III and LTR-II were visible (compare lanes 1 and 2, Fig. 3a). No stop corresponding to LTR-IV was detected, as expected, since LTR-IV has been previously reported to form upon induction by G4 ligands18. Upon addition of hnRNP A2, both LTR-III and LTR-II stop sites showed an insignificant decrease (compare lanes 3 and 2, Fig. 3a and b). Similarly, no effect was induced by addition of K+ and hnRNP A2 in the control LTR-II + III + IV M4 + 5 template lacking the possibility to form G4 (lanes 5\u20137, Fig. 3a).",

            "text": "As suggested by Xodo30, the apparent lack of effect in the presence of an unfolding protein could be due to the protein binding to the template sequence which would stimulate polymerase stop and mask G4 release at the same binding site. We thus switched to a dual-labelled system where oligonucleotide folding could be monitored by changes in fluorescence. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a spectroscopic technique that provides information about structure and dynamics of nucleic acids folding. It involves a donor fluorophore in an excited state, the excitation energy of which can be transferred to a proximal acceptor chromophore. Given that the major determinant of FRET efficiency is the distance between the acceptor and the donor, fluorescence intensities depict nucleic acids folding states. Consequently, when annealed to its complementary sequence to form a double-stranded structure, the tested oligonucleotide would yield the maximum fluorescence intensity, while the G4 folded conformation would be the least fluorescent. In these conditions the measured fluorescence intensity allows to calculate the energy transfer (E) and the end-to-end distance (R) between the two fluorophores, and therefore the unfolding degree. The G4 folded LTR-II + III + IV sequence was characterized by R of ~38\u01fa, with E ~0.84. When the G4 structure was converted into the duplex conformation by addition of the complementary C-rich strand, the fluorophores were separated by ~150 \u01fa, and FRET was approximately 0. Treatment of LTR-II + III + IV G4 with hnRNP A2 increased fluorescence by 3-folds with respect to the free G4, and E decreased to 0.51 (Fig. 4a and b, Supplementary Table S2). Considering that the complete unfolding of the G4 structure required \u0394E = 0.72, the \u0394E = 0.30 induced by hnRNP A2 reflected a 42% unfolding (Fig. 4c). The negative control protein BSA showed negligible unfolding activity in these conditions (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table S2). To test the statistical significance of the effect observed in the presence of the protein, we applied a model comparison approach, which allows to test the statistical role of an independent variable (in our case the hnRNP A2 protein) through the comparison of two models differing only in that variable. The test yielded F (2, 189) = 36.27 and P < 0.0531, indicating that the difference observed in the presence and absence of the protein was statistically significant. Analysis of the activity of hnRNP A2 was extended to shorter LTR sequences, i.e. LTR-III + IV, LTR-III and LTR-IV G4s, folded in 100 mM K+. The unfolding of LTR-III + IV and LTR-IV was similar but lower than that on the full-length sequence (31%); unfolding of LTR-III was very low (8.5%) (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S2\u2013S4) When the G4-forming sequences were folded in lower K+ concentrations, i.e. 50 and 25 mM, a distinct enhancement of unfolding was observed: unfolding up to 83% was obtained in the LTR-II + III + IV oligonucleotide (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1).",

To test this hypothesis, melting temperatures (Tm) of the dual-labelled oligonucleotides were thus measured by FRET-monitored thermal unfolding (Table 2). The most stable sequence was LTR-III (Tm 62.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C), followed by LTR-IV and LTR-III + IV (Tm 59.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C and 55.2 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C, respectively); LTR-II + III + IV was the least stable sequence (Tm 49.1 \u00b1 0.1), confirming that the observed unfolding scale depended on the oligonucleotide stability in the FRET system.

We thus performed a Taq polymerase stop assay to assess the G4 mutual formation and stability at increasing K+ concentration in the full-length LTR. LTR-III was used as a control sequence where only one G4 could form. We observed that in the full-length LTR-II + III + IV sequence, both LTR-II and LTR-III G4s formed upon addition of K+ (lanes 2\u20133, Fig. 5a); of these, LTR-III G4 induced a slightly more intense stop than LTR-II, suggesting a preferred formation of LTR-III in the full-length sequence (Fig. 5b). LTR-III was also the only G4 forming in the LTR-III + IV template (lanes 5\u20137, Fig. 5a). Interestingly, the LTR-III that formed in the full-length sequence was less intense than LTR-III forming in the shortest oligonucleotides (compare lanes 2\u20133, with 6\u20137 and 9\u201310, Fig. 5a and b). These data indicate that i) LTR-III is the most prominent G4 among the mutually exclusive LTR G4s and ii) when LTR-III forms in the full-length LTR promoter, its stability maintains a level that is fully susceptible to hnRNP A2 processing.",

Silencing of the LTR G4 folding/stabilizing protein nucleolin significantly increased promoter activity, indicating the inhibitory effect of nucleolin on LTR-driven transcription22. To assess the effect of hnRNP A2/B1 binding/unfolding of the full-length LTR G4s, a set of anti-hnRNP A2/B1 siRNAs was used, which effectively silenced hnRNP A2/B1 expression in 293T cells (Fig. 6a). In these conditions, LTR-driven transcription decreased by 45% at the highest siRNA concentration in the wt LTR sequence (Fig. 6b). In contrast, the LTR sequence with two point mutations that disrupt G4 folding was only marginally affected by hnRNP A2/B1 depletion (Fig. 6b), indicating that the effect was G4-specific. In these conditions, hnRNP A2/B1-silenced 293T cells showed no reduction in cell viability at 48 h with respect to the controls, thus confirming the consistency of the inhibitory effects on LTR promoter activity. Silencing of hnRNP A2/B1 was also performed in the TZM-bl reporter cell line, which contains stably integrated copies of the luciferase gene under control of the LTR wt promoter and thus closely resembles the integrated provirus. The LTR-driven reporter transcription decreased up to 33% in hnRNP A2/B1-silenced cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). These data further confirm the unfolding activity of hnRNP A2/B1 on the LTR G4s.",

In this context, the lower virus production observed upon siRNA-mediated depletion of hnRNP A2/B1 in infected cells was ascribed to accumulation of viral genomic RNA in cytoplasmic compartments or in the nucleus41. Our results showing decreased transcriptional activity upon depletion of hnRNP A2/B1 indicate a possible additional mechanism of inhibition of virus production mediated by increased G4 folding in the HIV-1 LTR promoter in the absence of hnRNP A2/B1. Surprisingly, overexpression of this protein and other hnRNP members induced similar effects, i.e. inhibition of transcription and reduction of virus production42. We suggest that upon stimuli that boost viral transcription (i.e. integral release of LTR G4s upon hnRNP A2/B1 massive overexpression) the virus (or the cell) activates counteracting mechanisms to avoid excessive exploitation of the cell by the virus that would lead to fast cell death, in the end impairing virus production. Therefore, the reported transcription inhibition might be mediated by other factors triggered by hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression.",

In contrast, the same G4 structures folding in a longer context (LTR-II + III + IV) were less stable and were effectively processed by hnRNP A2/B1.

Currently, only the actively transcribed virus is targeted by antiviral drugs, while eradication of the HIV-1 infection has been made impossible by the existence of reservoirs of the latent virus50.

Bands were washed with 100 mM NH4HCO3, dehydrated with CH3CN twice, and then digested overnight with 1 \u03bcg of MS-grade trypsin (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in 50 \u03bcl of 50 mM NH4HCO3. Peptides were extracted twice with 5% formic acid and twice with 50% CH3CN/5% formic acid. The peptide mixture was further desalted in a silica nanocolumn (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ, USA) packed in house with pinnacle C18 pack material (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The desalted mixture was finally analyzed by direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI) on a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer utilizing quartz emitters produced in house. A stainless steel wire was inserted through the back-end of the emitter to supply an ionizing voltage that ranged between 0.8 and 1.2 kV. Putative peptides present in wt LTR-II + III + IV (but not in M4 + 5) samples were submitted to tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis. The masses of the 50 most intense fragment ions were employed to perform a Mascot Database Search51 to identify their parent protein. Significant Mascot hits were accepted as positive matches and their ion score reported (see MS protein identification in ref. 22 for more details). Supernatants were further analysed by Western blot with an anti-hnRNP A2/B1 antibody (mouse monoclonal DP3B3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA).",
