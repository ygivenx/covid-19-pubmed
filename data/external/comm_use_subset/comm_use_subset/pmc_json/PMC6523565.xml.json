            "text": "The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2)/SMA- and MAD-related protein (SMAD) signaling pathway plays a significant role in regulating numerous processes in the cell, including cellular proliferation [1], differentiation [2], and the cell cycle [3], as well as apoptosis [4], by introducing extracellular signal transduces into the cell nucleus. The classic TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway consists of a ligand (TGF-\u03b21) and two transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, namely TGF-\u03b2 receptor I (TGFBR1 or ALK5) and TGF-\u03b2 receptor II (TGFBR2), as well as SMADs (SMAD2/3/4). Activation of the signal depends on the interaction between the ligand and TGFBR2 leading to the dimerization of TGFBR2 and TGFBR1. During this process, TGFBR1 is phosphorylated and activated by the kinase activity of TGFBR2. Activated TGFBR1 phosphorylates downstream molecules SMAD2 and SMAD3, subsequently leading to the formation of a trimeric complex with SMAD4. Finally, this complex translocates into the nucleus and modulates downstream gene transcription in response to extracellular signals [5]. Therefore, as a core transmembrane receptor, TGFBR2 plays a significant role in the TGF-\u03b2 signal transduction. For example, odontoblast-specific TGFBR2 conditional knockout in mice results in the loss of responsiveness to TGF-\u03b2 along with inactivation of the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway, causing impaired matrix formation and pulpal obliteration in odontoblasts [6]. The mutational inactivation of TGFBR2 can inhibit TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway activity and its tumor-suppressing ability, thereby promoting colon cancer [7]. Besides, down-regulation of TGFBR2 by using TGFBR2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or a small-molecule inhibitor ablates the TGF-\u03b2 signal-mediated process [8,9].",

            "text": "The expression of TGFBR2, in vivo or in vitro, is controlled by multiple factors, including genetic and epigenetic factors [10,11,12,13]. At the genetic level, for instance, the TGFBR2 protein was truncated and inactivated because of TGFBR2 mutations, thus inhibiting its growth regulatory functions in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers [14]. Besides, TGFBR2 is also known to be regulated by several transcription factors such as zinc finger protein 32 (ZNF32) [15] and/or co-activators such as yes-associated protein 1 (YAP-1) [16]. At the epigenetic level, TGFBR2 expression is widely regulated by various factors, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [17,18]. For example, miR-93 down-regulates its target gene, TGFBR2, in prostate cancer and leads to acceleration of cell growth and invasion [19]. miRNA-520f and miR-7 are known to suppress TGFBR2 and inhibit epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells [20,21]. Furthermore, lncRNAs usually regulate TGFBR2 expression by interacting with miRNAs. A recent study reported that lnc-small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (lnc-SNHG1), an overexpressed lncRNA found in the tumor tissues and cells lines originating from invasive pituitary cancer, directly binds to miR-302/372/373/520 and promotes expression of their common target, TGFBR [22].",

Western blot analysis showed that p-SMAD3 levels were dramatically reduced in GCs when miR-1306 was overexpressed (Figure 2A), while p-SMAD3 levels in the GCs increased when miR-1306 was inhibited (Figure 2B). Next, we analyzed whether TGFBR2 mediated the modulation of the miR-1306 levels during the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway. As expected, we discovered that TGFBR2 overexpression rescued the miR-1306 levels by suppressing down-regulation of p-SMAD3 level induced by the miR-1306 mimics (Figure 2C), while knockdown of TGFBR2 inhibited the miR-1306 inhibitor-mediated enhancement in p-SMAD3 level in GCs (Figure 2D).

Results showed that the luciferase activity of plasmids with the wild-type SBE, SBE1-mut, and SBE4-mut were dramatically enhanced after SMAD4 overexpression, but that of the SBE2/3-mut construct remains the same (Figure 5C), suggesting that SMAD4 inhibits miR-1306 transcriptional activity via SBE2/3 motif of the core promoter. Subsequently, using a ChIP assay, we confirmed that only the SBE2/3 motif within the miR-1306 promoter could specifically bind to SMAD4 (Figure 5D). Collectively, these results provide compelling evidence that SMAD4 directly interacts with SBE2/3 motif and inhibits the miR-1306 gene transcription in GCs.",

Therefore, miR-1306 expression may be mediated through SMAD4 feedback regulation of TGFBR2. To further confirm this, we co-transfected miR-1306 inhibitor with SMAD4-siRNA and miR-1306 mimics with pcDNA3.1-SMAD4 into the GCs. After detection, we found that the knockdown of SMAD4 dramatically suppressed miR-1306 inhibitor-induced increase in TGFBR2 protein expression (Figure 6A). In contrast, the overexpression of SMAD4 rescued the miR-1306-induced decrease in TGFBR2 protein expression (Figure 6B), indicating that SMAD4 feedback activates TGFBR2 by decreasing miR-1306. Further, we tested whether miR-1306 expression levels are affected by the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway. Our results showed that the miR-1306 levels sharply reduced in the GCs treated with 20 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway activation) (Figure 6C). Therefore, miR-1306 can interact with SMAD4 and TGFBR2, which further participates in SMAD4-mediated positive feedback regulation of the classical TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway in GCs.",

Actually, ALK1 could also act as partner of TGFBR2 [25] but ALK1 mediates the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 [26] and activates SMAD2/3 only in the presence of ALK5, which is essential for SMAD2/3 phosphorylation [27]. In this study, we identified and characterized the 3\u2019-UTR of porcine TGFBR2 gene and observed several response elements such as ARE, GREs, and MREs for the first time. It is well known that the levels of mRNAs are largely controlled by mRNA decay mechanisms including mRNA decay induced or inhibited proteins and small regulatory RNAs [28,29]. Furthermore, some cis-elements in the mRNAs 3\u2019-UTRs are also known to mediate the regulation of mRNA decay, such as PAT [29,30], ARE [31], iron-responsive element (IRE) [32], GRE [33], and MRE [34]. Many studies have demonstrated that the expression of TGFBR2 is modulated by MREs and their miRNAs in various cell types, such as miR-145 in vascular smooth muscle cells [35], miR-9-5p in hepatic stellate cells [36], miR-9 and miR-9-5p fibroblasts (HCFs) [6,37], miR-520e, miR-9-5p, and miR-135b in cancer cells [38,39,40]. Notably, miR-143 [23], miR-130a, miR-425, and miR-1306 [9] are known to target TGFBR2 in porcine GCs. However, currently there are no studies investigating the involvement of other cis-elements like PAT, ARE, and GRE in TGFBR2 mRNA decay.",

In this study, we further confirmed that TGFBR2 is a functional target of miR-1306 in porcine GCs and miR-1306 promotes GC apoptosis by impairing TGFBR2 and inactivating TGFBR2-dependent TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway. TGFBR2 and TGFBR2-dependent TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway participate in GC apoptosis, as observed in several studies conducted on mammals. In pigs, for instance, TGFBR2 is a crucial repressor of GC apoptosis [9]. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 could activate TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway and inhibit GC apoptosis, while blocking the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway by a specific inhibitor such as LY2157299, which can promote GC apoptosis [23,41]. Similarly, the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway is also known to play an important role in GC apoptosis in mammals such as humans and rodents [42,43,44,45]. While the function of miRNA-1306 has been seldom reported, studies have strongly suggested that miRNA-1306 can target and inhibit ADAM10 gene, a key gene of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [46]. Our findings define the function of miR-1306 in GC apoptosis as well as follicular atresia in mammals. The results of our study also proved that miR-1306 might serve as a molecular stimulator for female fertility. Moreover, our findings reveal the mechanism of action of miR-1306 in GCs as well as its ovarian functions.",

The proportion of intragenic miRNAs varies from approximately 33% in pigs to 55% in mouse, and most of them are intronic miRNAs, while very few are exonic miRNAs [47]. The transcriptional regulation and functions of intragenic miRNAs and their host genes has been a hot topic of research [48,49]. Most intronic miRNAs are seen to co-express and are functionally consistent with their host genes [48,50,51]. A recent study showed that the transcription of intronic miRNAs does not depend on host genes and their functionally coordination is less extensive than expected [52]. However, the relationship between exonic miRNAs and their host genes still remains unknown [53]. Our study suggests that although the transcription of miR-1306, which is an exonic miRNA, is suppressed by the transcription factor SMAD4, its host gene DGCR8 is not regulated by SMAD4 in porcine GCs. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that miR-1306 has its own internal promoter that is independent of the host gene, and that SMAD4 serves as a negative regulatory factor and suppresses miR-1306 by directly binding to SBE motif within this promoter region. Therefore, our findings provide strong evidence that the exonic miR-1306 is transcribed independently of the host gene in porcine GCs. This not only clarifies the relationship between miR-1306 and its host gene DGCR8 but also lays a foundation for the further understanding of its regulatory mechanism.",

Recently, a few reports have revealed the mechanism of this feedback regulation, which was found to be mediated by the miR-122-5p\u2013TGFBR2 axis in mouse skeletal muscle fibrosis [55] or by the miR-425-TGFBR2 axis in porcine GCs [9]. Among the classical TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway, SMAD2 and SMAD3, another two SMAD proteins, were found to be feedback regulators in as early as 2001 and 1999, respectively [56,57]. This feedback regulation has recently been demonstrated to be achieved through the miRNA\u2013TGFBR2 axis (e.g., the miRNA-520e\u2013TGFBR2 axis) [38]. This suggested that TGFBR2 is an important target in the feedback regulation of the SMAD protein from the classical TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway. Another key receptor, TGFBR1, is a primary target of SMAD7 (an inhibitory SMAD protein [58]), which further regulated the classical TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway through negative feedback regulation. SMAD7 has been seen to regulate TGFBR1 through negative feedback in many ways [59]. In one of our recent studies, we have shown that SMAD7 directly binds to the promoter of TGFBR1 and further inhibits its transcription in porcine GCs [60].",

Moreover, the transcription factor SMAD4 was identified as a transcriptional regulator of the exonic miR-1306, but this process is not independent of its host gene DGCR8. Our findings also reveal a feedback mechanism of the classical TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway (Figure 6D) and provide novel insights into feedback regulation within the classical TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway.",
