The clinical features of the disease are characterized with watery diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and depression in pigs of all ages, and high morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets [1]. Enteropathogenic viruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) are causative agents for viral diarrhea in pigs [2]. Data from previous studies demonstrate that in recent years, highly virulent variant PEDV is the most common etiological pathogen responsible for porcine diarrhea in China. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by PEDV, was first recognized as transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE)-like diarrhea in pigs in Shanghai, China, in 1973. The causative agent of PED was defined in 1984 [3]. Prior to 2010, PEDV infections were sporadic or endemic in China [1]. Since late 2010, variant strains of PEDV have emerged in China, and rapidly spread throughout the country [4, 5]. Pigs of all ages have suffered from a serious PED pandemic, resulting in the huge losses of piglets within 7 days of being born due to 80\u2013100% morbidity and up to 100% mortality [2]. Currently, highly virulent pandemic variant PEDVs in genotype II group are dominant strains of PEDV, whereas classical strains of PEDV in genotype I group, including SD-M, AH-M, SQ2014, and SC1402 are rare [6\u20138]. In May 2013, PED was first reported in Iowa State in the USA, and afterwards rapidly spread to the main pork product states within a year [9, 10]. Thereafter, diarrhea outbreaks caused by variant PEDVs appeared in other Asian countries (Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam, and Philippines) [11\u201314], America (Canada, Mexico, etc) [15, 16], and European countries (Austria, Ukraine, Belgium, Germany, etc) [17, 18].",

            "text": "The newly emerged PDCoV is ranked as the number 2 agent responsible for pig diarrhea, with detection rates about 30% in diarrheal samples of pigs [19\u201321]. PDCoV belongs to the genus of deltacoronavirus, the family of coronaviridae, and was first described in swine samples from a surveillance performed in Hong Kong in 2012 [19]. Subsequently, the presence of PDCoV was successively recognized in the United States, South Korea, mainland China, and Thailand [20\u201322]. Clinical manifestations and histopathologic features referable to PDCoV are indistinguishable from those associated with PEDV and TGEV [20], and are characterized by acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, depression and dehydration. In early 2017, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a novel diarrheal coronavirus, was recognized in young piglets and resulted in high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets, and then, this virus was frequently detected in diarrheal samples but confined in several pig farms in Guangdong province in Southern China [23, 24]. The SADS-CoVs had 95% genetic homology with bat-HKU2 coronavirus [25]. In the context of porcine diarrhea-associated viruses, TGEV and PoRV used to be the major pathogenic agents in pigs associated with severe diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets. TGEV is a coronavirus belonging to the genus of alphacoronavirus, within the family of Coronaviridae [26]. PoRV is a non-enveloped, 11-segmented double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus of rotavirus, in the family of Reoviridae [27]. In recent years, outbreaks caused by TGEV and PoRV in China were sharply reduced [28\u201330].",

In addition to PEDV, PDCoV, TGEV, and PoRV have also been observed among some diarrhea samples tested. PDCoV was the second dominant virus, with a prevalence varying between 19.62 and 29.19%. In this study, SADS-CoV was only identified in samples collected from Fujian province, but not observed in any samples from Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces. The positive rate of SADS-CoV was 10.29% (7/68) in diarrheal piglets from Fujian province. TGEV and PoRV were both detected at a low frequency (<3%). The positive number of farms infected with these diarrhea-associated viruses had been counted in the 168 sampled pig farms.

These results were consistent with the findings presented in other studies performed in other areas in China during the same period [1, 32]. These data suggested that PEDV infections were common in pigs in China, the biggest pork production country. As documented, however, prior to 2010, PEDV infections in China were mostly sporadic or endemic with no large-scale outbreaks. Since late 2010, large-scale PED outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality have occurred in pigs in China. Zhang et al. (2014) surveyed samples from 29 provinces in China between 2011 and 2014, and found that the detection rates of PEDV varied between 61.10 and 78.49% in diarrheal pigs.

SADS-CoV, a newly emerged coronavirus causing acute diarrhea in suckling piglets was firstly recognized in Guangdong province, in Southern China in 2017 [23, 34]. In the present study, SADS-CoV was not detectable in the samples from Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces. However, a positive rate of 10.29% (7/68) of this virus was identified in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province. Thus, up to date, SADS-CoV was only identified in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, in China until now. PEDV infections were more common in sows (52.81%) and suckling piglets (62.37%), and the same situation was observed for the presence of PDCoV. These data suggested that suckling piglets were at a greater risk posed by diarrhea viruses, especially PEDV. Co-infections of diarrheal-associated coronaviruses are common. Therefore, the diagnosis of swine diarrhea has become increasingly complicated and due to sharing similar clinical features caused by different enteric pathogens, an accurate differential diagnosis can only be achieved via laboratory tests.",

Since late 2010, highly virulent PEDV strains have emerged in China and subsequently been detected in other countries [35]. Although CV777-based PEDV vaccines were widely used in China, high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets due to the infection of variant PEDVs were frequently observed. Genetic analysis based on the circulating strains of PEDV revealed that all PEDVs could be devided into two genotypes, GI and GII: 1) GI comprising of the classical strains of PEDV, which was representated by CV777 and the strains appeared before 2010, and 2) GII comprising the variant strains identified after 2010. Mutations, including insertion and deletion, were frequently observed among the complete genome of variant PEDVs, and of which, most were located in the spike gene, including the antigen epitope areas [36]. The S protein of PEDV is an important structural protein of coronavirus, and is thought to encode the antigenic determinants, especially the neutralizing epitopes of the virus [37]. Based on the phylogenetic analysis on the S protein, all of the 14 strains indentified in this study belonged to variant PEDV in GII. As reported, mutations appeared in the neutralizing epitopes on the S protein of PEDV, including a CO-26 K equvalent epitope COE (aa 499\u2013638), SS2 (aa 748\u2013755), SS6 (aa 764\u2013771), and 2C10 (1368\u20131374) when compared with classical strains of PEDV [38, 39]. In this study, fourteen strains of PEDV idenetified had multiple mutations in the neutralizing epitope region of SS2 and SS6 when compared with CV777, which further verified demonstrated that currently circulating strains of PEDV were variant PEDVs, which could account for the poor protection in pigs when administrated CV777-based vaccines.",

The results indicated that PEDV was the most frequently detected virus with a prevalence rate varying between 50.21 and 62.1%. PDCoV was the second prevalent virus detectable in the diarrheal samples in pigs. It is worth noting that PDCoV-associated enteric disease might be a long-term threat to pig herds though it only appeared recently. We first reported the newly emerged SADS-CoV in Fujian province in Southern China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the PEDVs in Southern China during last 7 years were variant PEDVs in GIIa, and the PDCoVs tested were closely related with Chinese PDCoVs.",
