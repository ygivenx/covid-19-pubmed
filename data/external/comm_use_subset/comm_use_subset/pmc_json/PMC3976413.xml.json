In addition, quantifying geographic access is a first step towards identifying regions with potentially strained resources, which has implications for routine critical care delivery as well as for pandemic event planning [11]. Severe respiratory illnesses caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [12], avian influenza A [13] or other respiratory pathogens may place abrupt demands on regional intensive care resources underscoring the importance of a geographic access evaluation. Finally, this evaluation could inform a larger discussion regarding the value of regionalized intensive care for more broadly defined severe critical illness.",

In contrast to other time-sensitive medical conditions [14]\u2013[16], severe ARDS can develop over days, often after hospital admission [17], [18]; therefore, we incorporated interhospital transfers into our geographic access calculations. We included long distance transits in our model as they are considered feasible and safe by ground [19] or air [8], [20] in this patient population.

We excluded adult cases reported from children's hospitals, to identify hospitals that provide routine care of adult patients. Second, we used the 2010 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file to identify hospitals reporting ECMO in administrative claims. MedPAR includes the final action claims of all hospitalized fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and is the only national source of hospital claims data. We analyzed claims for patients 18 and older from the 50 United States and the District of Columbia.

We defined hospitals as having a high volume of mechanical ventilation if they reported more than 315 mechanical ventilation claims from adult Medicare patients in 2010. We used this threshold based on a prior volume-outcome study in medical patients receiving mechanical ventilation [9] and the age distribution of medical patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the United States [29]. The 315 threshold in Medicare estimates an all-payer hospital volume of approximately 600 mechanical ventilation cases per year, calculated using the proportion of medical patients in the United States who are aged 65 or older and are mechanically ventilated (52%) [29].",

An estimated 96.4% and 98.6% of the national population had geographic access to a high capability center; however, this degree of access required substantial interhospital transfer of many patients, including up to two hours by rotatory air transport. Adequate referral center access in the case of disasters and pandemics will depend highly on local and regional care coordination across political boundaries.",
