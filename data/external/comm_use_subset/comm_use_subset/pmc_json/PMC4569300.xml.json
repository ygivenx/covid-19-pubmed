Liver accumulation of FGL2 directly activates the coagulation cascades, a phenomenon known as virus induced procoagulant activity [3].

Nevertheless, the mechanisms on how the inflammatory signaling events that regulate the disease progression are not well understood. Recently, it has been shown that dysregulated NLRP3 (also known as NALP3 and cryopyrin) inflammasome in macrophages causes the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, which highlights the importance of inflammasome in regulating immune-mediated tissue damages [6]. The generation of biologically active IL-1\u03b2 requires cleavage of the inactive precursor proIL-1\u03b2 by the NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein-scaffolding complex consisting of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated peck-like protein with CARD domain, Pycard) [6, 7]. NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1\u03b2 mediate the host protection against pathogen invasions, whereas, the hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of certain inflammatory syndromes, including liver injuries such as nonalcoholic/alcoholic steatohepatitis [8, 9], liver fibrosis [10], and immune mediated liver injuries [11]. However, the role of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway participates in the pathogenesis of viral FH is still unclear.",

Nevertheless, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase are considered to be one of the major factors that activate NLRP3 inflammasome [13]. It has been shown that pharmacological inhibition of the NADPH oxidase complex (NOX) or the down regulation of the NOX subunit p22\nphox eliminates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by preventing ROS secretion [13, 14]. However, recent studies have also illustrated that mitochondria-originated ROS (MitoSOX) rather than NOX-derived ROS drive NLRP3 inflammasome activation [15, 16]. Various stress condition, including increased metabolic rates, hypoxia, or membrane damage, all significantly induce MitoSOX secretion [17]. Conversely, it remains uncertain for which of the NOX-derived ROS or MitoSOX is responsible for causing NLRP3 inflammasome- dependent pathology in viral FH development.",

Conversely, the virus infected IL-1R1\n-/- mice present with much attenuated pathologies, showing with a significant reduction in macrophage-derived FGL2 expression and less liver infiltration of CD45+Gr-1high neutrophils. Furthermore, we showed that the in vivo bioactivation of proIL-1\u03b2 during MHV-3 infection is mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereafter, both the NLRP3\n-/- mice and the Caspase-1\n-/- mice display substantial resistance to MHV-3-induced IL-1\u03b2 production. Mechanistically, MHV-3 infection triggers an acute release of NOX-derived ROS. Blocking ROS with Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) inhibits Caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 maturation in vitro. Furthermore, NOX subunit p47\nphox- deficient mice also exhibited a delayed and moderate viral pathogenesis due to reduction in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo. These results reveal that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 axis is a critical signaling pathway leading to the pathogenesis of viral FH.",

Assessment of the PEMs isolated from the 24h of virus infected C57BL/6 WT mice also revealed a significant increase in proIL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression (Fig 1B). Moreover, proIL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression in the infected livers appeared to be markedly augmented at 48h (p = 0.0231), sustaining to 72h (p = 0.0356, Fig 1B). In accordance, western-blotting showed with increases in proIL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 p17 protein expression at corresponding time points in the infected livers (Fig 1C). Flow cytometry further validated the patterns of proIL-1\u03b2 protein induction in the PEMs isolated from the virus-infected mice (Fig 1D). In agreement, the infected mice also showed significant accumulation of serum IL-1\u03b2 during the infection (Fig 1E). In contrast, serum IL-1\u03b1 concentration exhibited little change in MHV-3 infected mice (Fig 1F).

To further investigate whether IL-1\u03b2 signaling affects the pathogenesis of viral FH, we infected IL-1R1\n-/- mice with MHV-3 (100 PFU) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Interestingly, IL-1R1\n-/- mice displayed with a significant increase in survival rate with 60% staying alive for 20 days, as compared to a 100% death of the WT littermates within 5 days of the viral infection (Fig 2A). IL-1R1\n-/- mice manifested a significant reduction in hepatocellular damage and a decrease in serum ALT/AST levels during the infection (Fig 2B). The expression of biliary glycoprotein-1 (Bgp1), the receptor for MHV-3 [19], appeared to be significantly lower in the virus infected IL-1R1\n-/- livers comparing to that in the WT controls (Fig 2C), concurring with the plaque assay data showing with limited virus entrance and amplification in the livers 72h post-infection (Fig 2D). In support, the MHV-3 infection efficiency in IL-1R1\n-/- PEMs dropped more significantly than in the WT counterparts in vivo (Fig 2E). Obviously, recombinant mouse IL-1\u03b2 protein (20 ng/ml) is able to significantly induce Bgp1 expression in PEMs and RAW264.7 cells in vitro (Fig 2F), and in concurrence, IL-1\u03b2 treated RAW264.7 cells appear to produce more virus than the PBS treated controls post-infection (Fig 2F). In validation, we injected the virus-infected WT mice with IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra, 10 mg/kg/day), a naturally occurring cytokine that blocks IL-1\u03b2 biologic response [18], and observed a significant limitation of IL-1\u03b2 secretion (p = 0.0007, S1A Fig), inhibition of Bgp1 expression (S1B Fig) and reduction of virus titers (S1C Fig), suggesting the existence of an IL-1R-dependent positive regulation on the virus receptor that directly associate with virus propagation in the host. These combined data clearly demonstrate that IL-1\u03b2 promotes viral amplification and exacerbates the progression of hepatitis.",

The limited FGL2 expression in macrophages correlates with the low concentrations of FGL2 observed in the virus infected IL-1R1\n-/- liver and serum (Fig 3B and 3C). Therefore, in response to MHV-3 viral infection, IL-1R1\n-/- mice responded with limited fibrinogen formation, leading to a down modulation of liver coagulation and necrosis (Fig 3D). Similarly, IL-1Ra-treated WT mice displayed with reduction of FGL2 and fibrinogen deposition in liver tissues, which was followed with decrease in liver damages and enhance the survival time (S1B, S1D and S1E Fig).",

To determine the role of IL-1\u03b2 in regulating these cells during viral FH, we firstly examined liver neutrophil infiltration status. Flow cytometry showed that in the liver-tissue samples from 48 and 72h post MHV-3 infection, the infiltration of CD45+Gr-1high neutrophils was substantially higher in the WT livers than that in the IL-1R1\n-/- littermates (Fig 3E and 3F). The number of CD4+Foxp3+Treg in the virus-infected livers appeared to increase significantly after MHV- 3 infection, nevertheless, little difference was observed between IL-1R1\n-/- mice and their WT controls (S2 Fig). Similarly, serum concentration of C5a, a cytokine that deteriorates the pathogenesis of MHV-3-mediated FH [5], was not changed dramatically between virus infected IL-1R1\n-/- mice and their WT controls (S3A Fig). These results suggest that attenuation of viral FH by IL-1R1 deficiency could be the consequence of both ineffective FGL2 production by macrophages and limited CD45+Gr-1high neutrophil infiltration in the affected liver.",

To further investigate the molecular mechanisms through which IL-1\u03b2 promotes FGL2 production, we examined these signaling pathways in IL-1\u03b2-treated RAW264.7 cells. Results showed that either IL-1\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b1 treatment alone, had a minimum stimulation on phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB chaperone I\u03baB\u03b1 (p-I\u03baB\u03b1) and the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 (p-p65), appearing only at extended incubation time point (12h). However, synergistic effects of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b2+TNF-\u03b1) seemed to be significant for which substantial increases in phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and p65 can be detected as early as 3h post infection (Fig 4C). Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation by Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic Acid (PDTC) successfully prevented FGL2 upregulation after IL-1\u03b2+TNF-\u03b1 treatment (Fig 4D). The combination of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 is capable of potently stimulation the phosphorylation of MAPKs, including extracellular signal-related kinase (p-ERK1/2) and p38 (pp38) (Fig 4C). Nevertheless, the ERK inhibitor-PD98059 and the p38-MAPK inhibitor-SB203580 seemed to be incapable of blocking FGL2 upregulation. Moreover, blocking all of these three pathways did not show additive effect on inhibition of FGL2 expression (Fig 4D). These results suggest that NF-\u03baB rather than the MAPK pathways is responsible for IL-1\u03b2+TNF-\u03b1-mediated FGL2 upregulation in viral infected macrophages.",

MHV-3 infected PEMs and RAW264.7 cells exhibited with a significantly enhanced NLRP3, ASC, pro-Caspase-1 and its activated form (Caspase-1 p20) within 12h of MHV-3 infection (Fig 5A). In accordance, qPCR analyses illustrated that the mRNAs for Nlrp3 and proCaspase-1 were significantly higher in the virus infected livers, this correlates with observation that these virus infected livers also manifest with higher expression of the respective protein (Fig 5B). Next, we infected Nlrp3\n-/- mice and Caspase-1\n-/- mice with MHV-3 to address the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome in the causing the virus-induced liver injuries. Remarkably, a 72h viral infection largely failed to induce IL-1\u03b2 expression in the livers, which was associated with significant reductions in liver FGL2 accumulation (Fig 5C), fibrinogen deposition and local tissue damages, along with significant decreases in serum ALT/AST enzymes as compared with the infected WT mice (Fig 5D). In agreement with these results, we also observed that Bgp1 expression was significantly lower in NLRP3\n-/- and Caspase-1\n-/- livers during infection (Fig 5C). Meanwhile, NLRP3\n-/- mice and Caspase-1\n-/- mice appeared to produce much less viruses at 72h of infection as compared to the WT controls (Fig 5E). Finally, NLRP3\n-/- and Caspase-1\n-/- mice presented with considerably prolonged survival rates toward MHV-3 infection in comparing to the WT controls (Fig 5F). The serum C5a in the viral infected NLRP3\n-/- and Caspase-1\n-/- animals was also significantly increased but no different from the WT control mice (S3B Fig), indicating that C5a up-regulation during the viral infection, appears to either additively or synergistically work with other inflammatory factors to cause viral FH. Together these observations further validate that the NLRP3/Caspase-1-inflammasome regulates the bio-processing of proIL-1\u03b2 for causing the MHV-3 mediated viral FH.",

However, the recombinant mouse IL-18 protein (50 ng/ml) alone, or in the combination with TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3, was unable to stimulate fgl2 mRNA transcription in RAW264.7 cells or SVE-10 endothelial cells in vitro (Fig 6C). Moreover, MHV-3 induced liver FGL2 production remained high in IL-18\n-/- mice (Fig 6D), showing with consequentially high levels of fibrinogen deposition, liver damages and hepatocyte necrosis (Fig 6E). Additionally, liver tissues isolated from IL-18\n-/- mice appear to up-regulate Bgp1 expression after MHV-3 infection. In accordance, these mice also manifested with high virus duplication (Fig 6F). Overall, IL-18\n-/- mice are still sensitive to MHV-3 infection (Fig 6G), suggesting that IL-18 is not essential in MHV-3-mediated fulminant hepatitis.",

Flow cytometry showed that the releasing of DCFH from MHV-3 infected PEMs and RAW264.7 cells significantly increased, especially at 12h and 24h post-infection (Fig 7A). This result correlates with the up-regulation of gp91phox, p47phox and NOX4, the subunits that are essential for acute ROS secretion in RAW264.7 cells (Fig 7B). However, the DCFH level dropped dramatically at 48h and 72h post the viral infection (Fig 7A), most likely owing to death of cells under these conditions (S4 Fig).",

Similarly, electron microscopy showed with swollen mitochondria in the MHV-3 infected Raw264.7 cells at 48h and 72h (Fig 7C).

NOX-originated DCFH was successfully inhibited by DPI in a dose dependent manner (Fig 7D). However, MitoXOS release was not prevented by the DPI treatment, even at a very high dose (50\u03bcM) (Fig 7D). The efficiency of NOX-originated ROS inhibition by DPI appeared to correlate with the reduction in IL-1\u03b2 activation in the infected RAW264.7 cells and PEMs in dose dependent manners (Fig 7E). Together, these results suggest that the hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophage is partially mediated by MHV-3 induced, NOX-derived ROS.",

To further investigate the role of NOX-originated ROS in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation, we infected p47\nphox-/- mice with MHV-3 and examined the severity of liver pathology. As anticipated, PEMs isolated from MHV-3 infected p47\nphox-/- mice showed with limited DCFH (Fig 8A). Interestingly, the p47\nphox-/- mice also displayed considerable resistance to MHV-3 infection, presenting with reduced disease severity within the prolonged survival time as compared with the WT controls (p = 0.0175, Fig 8B). The lack of virus-induced ROS response, which leads to prohibition of NLRP3/caspase-1 activation and thus reduction in IL-1\u03b2 production, seems to be responsible for this effect (Fig 8C and 8D). As a result, the virus infection is unable to generate significant FGL2 accumulation in the liver and serum (Fig 8C and 8D). Therefore, these mice manifested with less severe fibrinogen deposition, liver injury and hepatocyte necrosis, accompanying with low levels of AST/ALT enzymes released by the liver (Fig 8E). However, the limitation of IL-1\u03b2 secretion in these p47\nphox-/- mice only slightly affected liver Bgp1 expression (Fig 8C), and therefore live virus titers were still high at 72h of infection (Fig 8F). Conversely, the administration of IL-1\u03b2 (100 ng/mouse/day) in MHV-3 infected p47\nphox-/- mice was able to reinstate all aspects of disease severity typical in viral FH (Figs 8G and S5). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of viral FH.",

Interestingly, MHV-3 infection in IL-1R1\n-/- mice, or in WT mice treated with IL-1\u03b2 signaling inhibitors, such as using IL-1Ra, rescue the otherwise susceptible animals from the viral FH status, presenting with limited virus replication, attenuated disease progression and reduced mortality. We have also shown that the bioprocess of IL-1\u03b2 maturation is under the control of a key signaling pathway, involving a MHV-3 virus inducible, ROS-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Animals lacking of NLRP3, Caspase-1 or NADPH oxidase subunit p47\nphox that controls acute ROS secretion, all exhibited with reduced IL-1\u03b2 bio-processing that results in prevention of the MHV-3 mediated disease severity.

            "text": "Although macrophage-mediated inflammation has been speculated to be critical for gauging the pathological susceptibility of viral FH caused by MHV-3 infection [25], the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis are not well understood. IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are two key inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages which play a pivotal role in antimicrobial immunity [7, 23]. Previous studies have showed that IL-1R1\n-/- mice appear to have markedly reduced inflammatory pathology in the lung, presumably due to the impaired neutrophil recruitment upon influenza virus infection [26]. Conversely, Ramos et al. reported that IL-1R1\n-/- mice exhibited with a higher accumulation of the West Nile virus (WNV) in the central nervous system due to a restrained activation of the virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells [27]. Similarly, IL-1\u03b2\n-/- mice are more susceptible to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1)- mediated encephalitis due to an increase in viral load [28]. We here further explored the role of IL-1\u03b2 in MHV-3 mediated FH. Interestingly, IL-1R1\n-/- animals display a significant reduction in viral duplication, amelioration of liver damage and a prolonged survival rate against MHV-3 infection (Fig 2A and 2B). These effects are probably due to IL-1R1 deficiency lead to limit liver recruitment of CD45+Gr-1high neutrophils and decrease in production of the macrophage-derived FGL2, which mediates sinusoidal fibrin deposition and hepatocellular necrosis in response to MHV-3 infection [3]. Bgp1 (also called carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a,CEACAM1a) is the specific receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and down-regulation of Bgp1 by IFN-\u03b3 is related to the antiviral state and resistance to mouse hepatitis virus 3 infection [29]. However, Bgp1 does not appear to be involved in IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion from MHV-3 infected macrophages [30]. In contrast to IFN-\u03b3 treatment, we here showed that the expression of Bgp1 drops significantly in the IL-1R1\n-/- liver during the viral infection, suggesting Bgp1 expression in macrophages is induced by IL-1\u03b2/IL-1R1 signaling, and lacking the pathway may compromise virus entrance and amplification. These unpredicted data implies that IL-1\u03b2 has double-edge effects on the immune system, in which proper balancing with its signaling extent becomes essential for the host in protection against various invading viruses and meanwhile, in prevention of the potential collateral damage.",

McGilvray et al. found that both ERK and p38-MAPK proteins are activated in MHV-3 infected PEMs, and only inhibition of p38-MAPK can abolish FGL2 induction and its functional activity [31]. Jia et al. have illustrated that TNF-\u03b1 upregulates FGL2 expression via activation of NF-kB and p38-MAPK in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells [22]. Our recent work also have showed that the inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK efficiently block C5a-mediated FGL2 upregulation [5]. Ning et al., have demonstrated that the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4) cis-elements and its cognate transcription factor, HNF4\u03b1, are necessary for MHV-3-induced fgl2 gene transcription [32]. Based on these studies, we further examined the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-1\u03b2-mediated FGL2 expression. The results show that IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 synergistically induce NF-\u03baB, ERK and p38-MAPK tyrosine-phosphorylation (Fig 4C). However, the inhibition NF-\u03baB pathway, but not the ERK, or p38-MAPK signals, markedly prevented FGL2 expression (Fig 4D), suggesting that the NF-\u03baB pathways are responsible for IL-1\u03b2+TNF-\u03b1-mediated FGL2 augmentation.",

            "text": "The NLRP3, RIG-I and the AIM2 are three main types of inflammasome complexes that have been shown to control caspase-1 activity and IL-1\u03b2 maturation. It seems that AIM2 is responsible for detecting DNA viruses, while both NLRP3 and RIG-I associate with recognition of RNA viruses by cells [33, 34]. Recent evidences suggest that the host protective immunity requires the NLRP3 inflammasome for fighting against various kinds of viruses, including Influenza A virus, modified Vaccinia virus Ankara, Sendai virus, Respiratory Syncytial virus, Encephalomyocarditis viruses, as well as Adenoviruses [35]. Our study shows that the MHV-3 triggered NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1 mRNA as well as protein expression in PEMs and RAW264.7 cells in vitro (Fig 5A). Nevertheless, loss of either NLRP3 or Caspase-1 in macrophages reduces IL-1\u03b2 secretion upon MHV-3 challenge (Fig 5C). Additionally, NLRP3\n-/- and Caspase-1\n-/- mice essentially pheno-copied the manifestations of IL-1R1\n-/- mice in response to MHV-3 infections, these mice evidenced with reduction in MHV-3 virus-induced IL-1\u03b2 production and lessening of disease progression (Fig 5C\u20135F). These combined data suggest that NLRP3-inflammasome acts as a predominant pathway for triggering IL-1\u03b2 maturation by MHV-3, and probably also by other corona viruses. Previous study showed that RAW264.7 cells do not release mature IL-1\u03b2 because they do not express ASC [36]. Conversely, we here show that MHV-3 promotes IL-1\u03b2 secretion from virus infected RAW264.7 cells through inducing ASC expression. Together with the recent work demonstrated that NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 axis participates in the regulation of the generation of IL-1\u03b2 in RAW264.7 cells, indicating that ASC is inducible in the macrophage line RAW264.7 cells under circumstances, especially during MHV-3 infection [37].",

            "text": "ROS plays an essential role in mediating NLRP3 inflammasome activation [13]. Many different viruses, such as Influenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial virus, and Hepatitis C virus, trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation through ROS-dependent mechanisms [38\u201340]. NOX is an enzymatic complex consisting mainly of five subunits (p22phox, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox and gp91phox) and two GTP-binding proteins (RAC1/RAC2). We here show that MHV-3 triggers NOX-derived ROS secretion in macrophages by inducing NOX-subunits, including GP91phox, p47phox and NOX-4 expression in the very early stages of the viral infection (Fig 7A and 7C). Additionally, preventing NOX-derived ROS through DPI appeared to successfully down modulate NLRP3 hyperactivation and IL-1\u03b2 maturation in vitro (Fig 7F). Furthermore, virus infected p47\nphox-/- macrophages manifested with significant reduction in ROS secretion, leading to the control of NLRP3 hyperactivation, which results in attenuation in severity of the viral FH (Fig 8). These results are inconsistent with previous reports that have shown that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are not involved in activating NLRP3 inflammasome [41, 42]. One of the discrepancies is the different cell models are used in studies. Silica crystals, LPS, and uric acid crystals act as the stimulators in these studies, while MHV-3 virus is the activator in our research. Conversely, it is worth mentioning that not all p47\nphox-/- mice are completely resistant to MHV-3, and these animals eventually still died from the infections (Fig 8B), together with some virus infected mice still produce high levels of IL-1\u03b2 and virus titers, suggesting the presence of other mediators that in response to the virus challenge, are capable of activating NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo. One of the potential activators is MitoSOX [43, 44]. We have also observed a very high level of the MitoSOX production in the MHV-3 infected RAW264.7 cells at 48h and 72h post-infection in vitro, along with high frequency damage and destruction of mitochondria might simultaneously occur. However, the release of MitoSOX was unable to be successfully blocked by ROS inhibitor- DPI (50 uM) (Fig 7). Additionally, DPI is harmful to animals and unsuitable in vivo experiments [45]. The incapable of completely blocking ROS production by using high dose of DPI in vitro suggests the existence of other sources of ROS for activating NLRP3 inflammasome. Interestingly, reduced mortality and pathology were seen in MHV-3 infected p47\nphox-/- mice compared to WT littermates despite a lack of significant reduction in virus replication, suggesting that MHV-3-mediated pathology is due to inflammation and not direct virus infection. Recent studies by Warner Greene\u2019s group demonstrate that HIV can trigger caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death in which dying cells release their cytoplasmic contents, including inflammatory cytokines into the extracellular space where the virus infected CD4+ T-cells recite [46]. A similar environment might also explain for the MHV-3 induced FH status.",

For example, IL-18R\n-/- mice appeared to be protected from Influenza viral initiated inflammatory lung damages [48]. Consistent with previous reports, we have detected significantly high levels of matured IL-18 in the serum of MHV-3 infected WT mice. However, IL-18 deficiency does not prevent Bgp1 expression, virus amplification and FGL2 accumulation in the liver following MHV-3 infection, and as the consequence, these mice stay high with fibrinogen deposition, liver damage and hepatocyte necrosis (Fig 6). These results suggest that IL-18 is not essential for causing MHV-3 mediated acute hepatitis.",

Hepatotropic virus, like MHV-3 infection in mice, can induce exaggerated inflammation in the liver and cause life-threatening viral FH. These results shed lights on a novel strategy, for which the properly modulation of the IL-1\u03b2 signaling pathway, in combination with blocking other inflammatory factors, might benefit the treatment of viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases in human.",

(C) The expression of Casp-1 p20, IL-1\u03b2 p17, Bgp1 and FGL2 at 72h post-MHV-3 infection was compared by western-blotting. (D) Serum IL-1\u03b2 and FGL2 levels were measured by ELISA. N = 5 per group, *p<0.05 and **p<0.001, NS: no significant difference. (E) Liver fibrinogen deposition was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, the architecture was analyzed by H&E-staining and cellular apoptosis was analyzed using TUNEL staining (left). Scale bar 20 \u03bcm; arrow indicates positive cells; blue color indicates nuclear staining with DAPI, n = 5 per group. Serum ALT and AST activities were determined with an AU5400 automatic biochemistry analyzer (right). *p<0.05 and **p<0.001, n = 5 per group. (F) Liver virus titers at 72h of infection were analyzed by plaque assay (left), and their levels were compared by statistical analysis (right). *p<0.05. (G) MHV-3 infected p47\nphox-/- mice were treated with mouse recombinant IL-1\u03b2 protein (100 ng/day/mouse) and the survival rate was monitored. One of three experiments with similar results is shown. *p<0.05 compared top47\nphox-/- +PBS+MHV-3 group.",
