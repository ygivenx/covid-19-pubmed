The isolated viral strain was divided into previously reported strains in Japan and genetically similar to that reported in the US in May 2013. It was belonged to genogroup 2 according to the phylogenetic analysis of viral whole-genome sequences, also called the US prototype-like strains [2]. Subsequently, another genogroup 2 field strain called the INDEL (which has the insertion and deletion in the spike gene) strain was also isolated in Japan [3]. Further, Tottori2 strain with a larger deletion in the spike gene was reported in October 2014 [4]. Currently, the several genogroup 2 strains are circulating in Japanese pig farms as in another outbreak countries.",

All these vaccines are based on genogroup 1 strains and are different from the recent global epidemic strains of PEDV. Since PED outbreaks in North America in April 2013, the vaccine based on a truncated PEDV spike gene produced in the SirraVaxSM RNA Particle Technology platform, and an inactivated whole virus vaccine formulated with an adjuvant were used in the US from 2013 to 2014, respectively [9, 10].

            "text": "The PEDV spike protein plays important roles in interactions with cellular receptors during virus entry, growth adaptation in vitro, the induction of neutralizing antibodies and alteration of pathogenicity in vivo [16]. As shown in Fig. 2, we compared the amino acid sequences of P-5V vaccine strain with the newly emerging strains. Previous studies of the PEDV spike protein have identified neutralizing COE region (498-637 aa), epitopes SS2 (747-754 aa), SS6 (763-770 aa), and 2C10 (1367-1373 aa) [17\u201319]. There was no difference in the epitopes SS2 and 2C10 between genogroup 1 and 2 viruses, however, two amino acid differences (Leu763 and Asp765) were found in the SS6 of P-5V compared to the genogroup 2 viruses. In the P-5V strain, four amino acids (Ala516, Thr548, Gly593, and Gln632) were different from all genogroup 2 viruses, and one amino acid (Lys620) was different from the MZ0116-2/2013 strain. The Spike protein is also known as a type I glycoprotein [20], and the P-5V vaccine strain contains 22 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The predicted N-linked glycosylation sites were very similar among genogroup 1 and 2 viruses, however, there were three different N-linked glycosylation sites between the P-5V vaccine strain and the US prototype-like strains (position at Asn127, Asn229, and Thr1192).",

The clinical score of the vaccinated group was significantly lower than that of the control group on Day 4. The survival rate on Day 7 was 0% (0/11) in the control group and 80% (12/15) in the vaccinated group (Fig 3b). The vaccinated sows showed anorexia transiently, whereas feces were normal during the experimental period. The non-vaccinated sow showed anorexia and diarrhea on the day after the challenge or later. The milk secreted from the non-vaccinated sow was reduced, and no milk could be collected by human hand on Day 2 post-challenge or later. Therefore, the piglets derived from non-vaccinated sow were observed to drink a lot of water instead of taking less milk. However, undigested milk was filled in the stomach of all piglets that died during the experimental period.",

The vaccinated sows showed PED-specific antibody responses, and the neutralizing antibody was secreted in the colostrum. The vaccinated sows also showed a quick antibody response after the challenge. This quick antibody response suggests a possible booster effect by the infection of the sows with the virus shed from piglets. The above outcomes can contribute to reducing clinical signs and mortality rate in piglets derived from vaccinated sows by the live vaccine. Furthermore, the mortality rate before and after the onset of PED was reduced in vaccinated farms compared to a non-vaccinated farm. These results confirm that the PED live vaccine alleviates the damage is due to genogroup 2 field strains in not only experimental condition and also field farms. Further, it was also suggested that sows inoculated with the live vaccine prevented the progression of PED to a more severe condition. Differences in the amino acid sequences and N-linked glycosylation sites found in this study may have an impact on the antigenicity between the vaccine strain and the genogroup 2 strain. It is necessary to carry out future research to elucidate neutralizing cross-reactivity between genogroup 1 and 2 viruses.",

These vaccines are intramuscularly injected twice at intervals of 2 or 4 to 8 weeks in pregnant sows during the gestational period. Vaccinated sows secrete milk containing a neutralizing antibody against PEDV after farrowing. To secrete many neutralizing antibodies into the milk of vaccinated sows, it is preferable that the second vaccination is better as close as possible to the farrowing date, it is defined as 2 weeks before farrowing according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The neutralizing antibody taken by piglets into the gastrointestinal tract neutralizes orally infecting PEDV and blocks viral entry into mucosal epithelial cells to relieve PED symptoms. This immunization mechanism of the PED vaccine in piglets is called \u201clactogenic immunity\u201d and works based on a different action mechanism from the immunization of piglets by maternal antibody in the colostrum. Future study should examine whether the amount of virus is decreased in piglets by lactogenic immunity.",

Piglets are infected with PEDV and become more severe when they are unable to take sufficient milk during the suckling period for some reason. Another problem is that when sows with low neutralizing antibody titer are exposed to a large amount of the virus, they develop systemic symptoms associated with reduced milk secretion, limiting the full effect of the vaccine. Considering the above mechanism of the PED vaccine, sufficiently increasing the level of immunity in sows before they are infected with PEDV is one of the important factors to prevent PED.",

An ideal vaccine to overcome these problems would provide sows with mucosal immunity and piglets with more potent lactogenic immunity to protect both of them from the viral infection. Further research would be warranted to develop such an ideal vaccine by more closely understanding the pathogenic mechanism of PED, examining other immunization methods instead of intramuscular injection, and developing an effective antigen to induce the mucosal immune response.",
