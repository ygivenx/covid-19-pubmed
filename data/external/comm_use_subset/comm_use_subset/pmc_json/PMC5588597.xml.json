Currently, there is an attempt to eliminate the disease from the human population. Attempts at vector control, diagnosis, and development of pharmaceuticals have all been successful in the reducing the number of cases, however, a major missing piece in the elimination campaign is an effective vaccine candidate. The current most successful vaccine candidate RTS,S is only about 30% protective in children in Sub-Saharan Africa, the most vulnerable population [2, 3]. The goal of malaria elimination and the weaknesses of RTS,S necessitate the development of new more successful vaccine candidates.",

Coiled-coil domains are a common oligomerization domain in proteins known for their characteristic heptad repeat and stability, making them excellent choices for vaccine development [11]. One of the most interesting targets identified in this screen was P27, which showed complete conservation in field isolates [12]. P27 is a 27 amino acid sequence contained on the 1103 amino acid trophozoite export protein (Tex1) [13]. However, P27 was only able to activate 30% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from semi-immune individuals, leading to fears that it would not offer broad protection in a vaccinated diverse population. This lead to further screening of the Tex1 protein and the identification of P27A in the N-terminal portion of the protein, a region that was predicted to be intrinsically unstructured. Initial screenings demonstrated that people living in endemic areas had antibodies for P27A, it was immunogenic in small mammal models, and antibodies raised against P27A were capable of inhibiting P. falciparum in antibody-dependent cellular inhibition parasite-growth assay [14]. Currently, good immunogenicity results were obtained in phase Ia and Ib clinical trials of P27A combined with the adjuvants GLA-SE or Alhydrogel (ClinicalTrials.gov; PACTR201310000683408; manuscript in preparation).",

To be an effective vaccine an important consideration is the delivery system. Several recent effective vaccine candidates are based on particulate delivery systems that are able to repetitively express antigens [15]. One promising delivery system is the self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) [16]. Each SAPN monomer, the subunit that oligomerizes to form the nanoparticle, contains two coiled-coil domains held together by a linker. Antigenic B-cell epitopes are engineered on either the N or C terminal ends of the gene encoding the monomer. In the same way T-cell epitopes can be added to the core leading to a vaccine candidate that is able to activate both the humoral and cellular branches of the immune system. SAPNs show great promise for vaccine design [15, 17\u201319] and many SAPN-based malaria vaccines have previously been developed in our laboratories [20\u201323].",

In combination with the intrinsically unstructured epitope P27A, this vaccine candidate is immunogenic in a murine model and induces antibodies that are recognizing the same antigens as sera from seropositive individuals in Burkina Faso, a malaria endemic region.",

We believe the SAPN technology will be an excellent platform for the development of a malaria vaccine candidate based on the previously studied epitopes from the Tex1 protein. The prototypical SAPN design consists of a pentameric coiled-coil oligomerization domain linked to a trimeric coiled-coil oligomerization domain [16]. P27 has been found by prediction of its trimeric coiled-coil within the 27 residues. However, according to the coiled-coil prediction program PCOILS, the coiled-coil sequence extends over a span of at least 48 residues (Fig. 5). This prompted us to engineer a longer sequence of 50 residues containing the N-terminal P27-N and the C-terminal P27-C sequences. The whole extended coiled-coil stretch is then called P27-NC. Remarkably, the C-terminal fragment P27-C is highly conserved among many Plasmodium species (Fig. 5, and [14]) and thus potentially providing a cross-protecting immune response. The SAPNs\u2019 unique design allows P27-NC to be stably displayed in its native coiled-coil conformation. This should increase its immunogenicity and specificity and thus create a more effective vaccine candidate. Such an approach has previously been taken for the trimeric coiled-coil epitope of the SARS spike protein [29]. P27A is an intrinsically unstructured epitope, so it does not have the same conformation restrictions as a domain with a ridged shape.",

In a standard icosahedral structure four LCMs can further self-assemble into a full SAPN structure, meaning that 60 monomers make up each SAPN. However, recent biophysical studies combined with an analysis using viral tiling theory has shown that the SAPNs can possibly also assemble into higher order assemblies containing multiples of 60 chains per particle [27]. Each SAPN is predicted to contain 60 copies (or a multiple thereof) of P27A and P27-NC epitopes (Fig. 2b, d), indicating that they are effective at repetitively displaying each epitope, which is known to result in a more effective immune response.",

Computational models of SAPN-P27-2 and SAPN-Combo are displayed in Fig. 2. While the constructs containing only the trimeric coiled-coil epitope P27-NC as a B-cell epitope (SAPN-P27-1 and SAPN-P27-2) lead to severe aggregation, the constructs with the intrinsically unstructured epitope P27A (SAPN-P27A-1 and SAPN-P27A-2) formed very nice and soluble nanoparticles (Fig. 3a, b). SAPN-P27A-1 was characterized in 50 and 150 mM NaCl in a 20 mM phosphate buffer at the pH 6.8 and 7.4 and 5% glycerol. All four conditions resulted in satisfactory nanoparticle formation. This construct was further characterized by circular dichroism for evaluation of secondary structure and mainly \u221d-helical conformation was confirmed. Prior to circular dichroism analysis, a DLS run was taken to ensure nanoparticles were within expected range. For the construct SAPN-P27A-2 even the incorporation of additional features such as three CD8 epitope strings predicted by NetMHC (YYIPHQSSL, ELSEDITKY and HILYISFYFILV\u2014see also reference [38]) from the liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1) of the strain P. falciparum 3D7 in allowed formation of nice nanoparticles (Fig. 3b). We then reasoned that combining the problematic P27-NC epitope with the well-behaved P27A epitope in one single construct might help formation of well-shaped nanoparticles that contain the trimeric coiled-coil epitope P27-NC. Indeed, the SAPN-Combo construct with both epitopes was structurally and biophysically well-behaved (Fig. 3c, d). Thus, in such a construct we would be able to combine both Tex1 derived B cell epitopes in one single protein chain forming a SAPN.\n\n\n",

Total inhibition is observed in the homologous mode (same coating and inhibitory antigen, data not shown) while partial inhibition (up to 50%) is observed when SAPN-Combo and single antigens (Pept-P27A and Pept-P27-NC) are used for coating and soluble inhibitors, respectively (Fig. 4).

Apparently, to generate the most effective candidate new antigen choices as well as new delivery technologies need to be developed. Here we demonstrated the addition of two new promising B-cell epitopes P27-NC and P27A from the Tex1 antigen to the SAPN delivery system. In particular, the P27A antigen is currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a synthetic peptide (ClinicalTrials.gov; PACTR201310000683408), thus improving its immunogenicity by coupling to a suitable carrier seems to be a highly promising approach.",

Remarkably, for the corresponding shorter fragment Pept-P27-C 62% is recognized by 62% of donor\u2019s sera from Burkina Faso (Table 1). Since the P27-C is also highly conserved among many different Plasmodium species (Fig. 5), this is a welcome feature of our SAPN design as it may induce cross-protection among different Plasmodium species, including the most prominent parasites species P. falciparum and P. vivax.\n",

In addition, T-cell epitopes can be engineered into the SAPN core to be delivered to the antigen processing machinery of the cells. This unique design therefore allows for the inclusion of multiple T and B cell epitopes. In this case we included both P27-NC and P27A B-cell epitopes, which both have been established to be immunogenic in mice (P27 [10]), rabbits and humans (P27A [13], manuscript in preparation) in combination with a variety of CD4 and/or CD8 epitopes. Human purified antibodies specific for P27 and P27A have been shown to be active in ADCI [10, 14] and are associated with protection in people in endemic areas (unpublished results). By including both P27-NC and P27A antigens it is likely to have a higher probability of inducing protective antibodies in a population at large. The present design has the particular advantage of being very immunogenic without the need of any adjuvant.",

The epitopes P27 and P27A are expressed primarily on the asexual blood stage of the parasite\u2019s life cycle, while CSP is expressed on the pre-erythrocytic stage. A CSP based vaccine will only prevent infection before clinical symptoms develop. An asexual blood stage vaccine will actually help deal with preventing parasitemia from further developing and reducing clinical symptoms. As both approaches continue to be developed they eventually can be admixed to generate a vaccine candidate that prevents the initial infection, and can eventually prevent any breakthrough infection.",

Since P27 is highly conserved, this might even provide cross-protection among different Plasmodium species. If confirmed in human clinical trials, it would allow the development of a robust vaccine easy to manufacture, store and deliver to the needed population.
