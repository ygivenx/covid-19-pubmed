With millions of unvaccinated travellers visiting yellow fever virus-endemic countries, it is only a matter of time before people infected with yellow fever virus travel to countries in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific and secondary transmission occurs. The number of unvaccinated travellers who become infected and export the virus between endemic countries is the highest in decades, with 10 cases already confirmed in 2018.10 If yellow fever is introduced to their countries, governments are likely to demand vaccine, but the global manufacturing capacity is inadequate. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 50 million doses will be produced in 2018, this is not enough to provide emergency vaccination for a major epidemic. A yellow fever epidemic is likely to affect the global air transport system, causing delays and/or shortages in delivery of food and medicines, with potentially significant negative health and economic impact.11 Passive laboratory-based surveillance, as currently practiced in most at-risk countries, is unlikely to detect the introduction of yellow fever virus in time to contain its spread. All governments in countries at risk of yellow fever introduction need to adjust their policies and funding priorities accordingly, to ensure adequate surveillance, vaccination and capacity for containment.",
