The ideal animal model mimics the human immunological response, the pathogen infection pathway, and allows analysis of the mechanism of the vaccine-induced protective immune response. However, despite the availability of humanised animal models such as transgenic mice [4], immunological responses in most animal models are only indicative of what to expect in humans. The development of a recombinant vaccine is initiated with identification and selection of an antigen that induces a desired immune response. At this step, multiple antigens are tested, which requires an inexpensive and easy to handle animal model. Following selection of antigen, the optimal route of vaccine administration together with a proper adjuvant formulation has to be evaluated. The design of the individual vaccine components and their delivery thus relies on the performance in these pre-clinical animal tests, emphasizing the importance of the animal model.",

            "text": "Vaccines are one of the future strategies to prevent and control malaria [5], one of the most widespread, pathogenic and deadly parasitic diseases in the world. Immunity is only acquired after successive infections in areas of high and stable malaria transmission [6]. Pregnant women become susceptible to placental malaria (PM) independent of any pre-existing immunity acquired during childhood. Placental malaria can have serious consequences for both mother and child such as maternal and infant anaemia, premature labour, low birth weight, and increased neonatal mortality [7]. However, after successive pregnancies women rapidly acquire immunity to PM, indicating that a vaccine strategy against PM may be feasible [8]. PM is caused by the binding of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (IE) to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) present on placental syncytiotrophoblast cells located in the intervillous space [9], [10]. Placental parasites express on the IE surface VAR2CSA, which is a Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1) that mediates binding of the IE in the placenta [11], . VAR2CSA is a large (350 kDa) polymorphic protein with six Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domains, which complicates the development of a vaccine.",

However, for ethical and economic reasons this is not a feasible model for malaria vaccinology. To date, most malaria antigens are produced by recombinant technology and tested in lower mammalian species, such as rodents and rabbits. These models have allowed analysis of antibody responses to different combinations and boundaries of the six DBL-domains of VAR2CSA. Initially, we expressed all DBL-domains fromVAR2CSA-3D7 and found that all domains except DBL4\u03b5, could induce antibodies against native VAR2CSA expressed on the surface of IE, with limited differences in immunizations of mice and rabbits [14]. However, these VAR2CSA-3D7 specific sera did not show significant inhibition of IE binding to CSA (unpublished data). Recently, in a large screening of the immunogenicity of different VAR2CSA antigens from the parasite line FCR3 using rat immunizations, we found that the DBL4\u03b5 domain of VAR2CSA could elicit the desired adhesion-inhibitory antibodies [15]. However, the induction of functional inhibitory antibodies to certain DBL-domains is poorly reproducible and the immune response tends to focus on non-adhesion blocking epitopes [16], [17]. In addition higher levels of inhibitory antibodies are acquired using full-length VAR2CSA (FV2) as compared to single DBL-domains [18]. To further investigate the induction of adhesion blocking antibody responses, all single recombinant domains of VAR2CSA-FCR3 were used in immunizations of mice, rats and rabbits, and compared to responses raised against the full length recombinant protein.",

All animal species immunized with individual DBL-domains or FV2 produced an IgG response, with a typical sigmoid shaped dose response curve of the antibody titrations (Figure 1). However, the levels of antibodies to each of the DBL-domains as well as to FV2 differed depending on the animal species used (for all statistical analysis of antigenic differences see Table S2). In mice, the DBL6\u03b5 immunizations resulted in the most potent IgG response with a significantly higher titre than that of FV2 and the other DBL-domains. Following DBL6\u03b5 in potency was DBL5\u03b5 and thereafter a lower response induced by DBL1X, DBL2X, DBL3X, DBL4\u03b5 and FV2 of similar potency. As observed in mice, immunizations of rats with DBL6\u03b5 resulted in a significantly higher IgG response compared to all other immunogens. DBL5\u03b5 and FV2 induced in rats a more potent response than DBL1X, DBL2X, and DBL3X (Figure 1B) but also DBL4\u03b5 induced a high antibody response. In rabbits, the seven tested antigens produced IgG responses that can be grouped in two according to the levels of responses (Figure 1C). The DBL6\u03b5, DBL5\u03b5 and FV2 produced a high antibody response whereas IgG responses to DBL1X, DBL2X, DBL3X and DBL4\u03b5 domains were lower and essentially similar.",

The correlations between the antigenicity of the domains and reactivity to the native protein on the surface of IE were highly significant in immunization of mice and rabbits, whereas the levels of rat antibodies reacting with the native protein in general were higher, which resulted in a less significant correlation. However, taken together the reactivity increased towards the C-terminal end of the external part of VAR2CSA, both in immunizations with single domains and FV2. This may reflect both an inherent antigenicity of single DBL domains of VAR2CSA and/or the accessibility of single domains in the quaternary structure of the native VAR2CSA molecule.

For immunizations with single domains, the inhibition of IE binding to CSA varied between animal species. Only rats immunized with DBL4\u03b5 induced IgG, which efficiently inhibited IE binding, whereas the rabbit sera specific against DBL4\u03b5 were non-inhibitory. The inhibitory effect of the IgG was not an effect of antibody titer, since immunizations with DBL5\u03b5 and DBL6\u03b5 also induced high titers, but these were in general non-inhibitory. These findings are in contrast to what others have found [21], [28].

In addition, fair levels of antibodies was induced against the recombinant form of DBL4\u03b5 in rabbits, indicating appropriate T-cell responses during the immunizations, yet the DBL4\u03b5 specific rabbit sera was non-inhibitory even at rather high concentrations. Differential induction of binding-inhibitory antibodies is probably caused by species-specific differences in immuno-dominance of B-cell epitopes in different species of animals, similar to observations with antigens from other organisms [29], [30]. Responses to FV2 appeared more homogenous between species, at least with respect to the adhesion blocking properties, possibly due to presentation of more epitopes in a native form compared to single domains. Since the VAR2CSA molecule appears partly globular, immuno-dominant B-cell epitopes, not present in the native protein, may be exposed in individual DBL domains. This could also be the cause of the finding that antibodies induced against the DBL1X and DBL3X single domains, when based on heterologous sequences, can inhibit the binding of FCR3-IE [17], as opposed to antibodies induced against DBL1X and DBL3X, based on the FCR3 sequence [15].",

We previously did this with DBL4\u03b5-FCR3, DBL4\u03b5-3D7, DBL1X-3D7 and DBL3X-HB3 specific sera from rats [17]. The average reactivity to DBL4\u03b5 linear epitopes was apparently slightly skewed when comparing rat and rabbit antibodies. Otherwise, the majority of responses in rats and rabbits were surprisingly similar. This similarity, combined with the lack of functional activity of the rabbit antibodies, both with regard to surface activity and inhibitory capacity, probably shows that surface-reactive and binding-inhibitory rat antibodies are not targeting linear epitopes in the native protein. The most pronounced areas of reactivity against the linear sequence were mapped to regions in the DBL4\u03b5 model containing unstructured loops. This is in line with the findings that patches of high sequence diversity in VAR2CSA are concentrated in flexible loops [20], [31], [32] and that naturally acquired antibodies also are directed against these regions [33]. However, partly denatured antigen induced by Freund's adjuvant could increase the response to flexible loop regions in experimental immunizations [34]. Interestingly, a fraction of the expressed PfEMP1 during the maturation of the parasite in the IE remains intracellular [35]. Whether this intracellular pool of protein is denatured at the point of schizont rupture, promoting responses in natural infections to flexible loops more tolerant to mutations, as seen in other organisms [36], remains to be investigated.",
