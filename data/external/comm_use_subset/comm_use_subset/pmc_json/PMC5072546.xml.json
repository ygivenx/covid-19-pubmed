            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), of the family Paramyxoviridae, is a nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus that expresses 11 proteins [1]. RSV is amongst the most important pathogenic infections of childhood and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries [2]. The clinical manifestations of RSV infection range from mild upper-respiratory-tract illnesses (URTIs) or otitis media to severe and potentially life-threatening lower-respiratory-tract illnesses (LRTIs). The most common form of LRTI in RSV-infected infants is bronchiolitis, but pneumonia and croup are also seen [2\u20136]. There are two major antigenic subgroups of RSV, A and B, based on antigenic differences in their glycoproteins G and F [7\u201310]. The epidemiological features of RSV-A and RSV-B have differed in previous studies, and although strains of both subtypes often cocirculate, one subtypes generally predominates, depending on the region and climate [5, 6, 11, 12]. Therefore, the in-depth epidemiological characterization of RSV in specific areas is required worldwide, and especially in developing countries.",

Real-time PCR has many advantages in the detection of viruses, including its high specificity, high sensitivity, quantifiability, and simplicity of operation. It has been used for early diagnosis and the evaluation of drug efficacy and therapeutic effects, although the quantitative analysis of viruses in respiratory specimens is still impracticable. The results are usually simply positive or negative, although quantification is possible from Ct values or with plaque assays [14, 15]. The results from two independent respiratory specimens, such as throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, or bronchial alveolar lavage fluid, can differ, even when both specimens are taken from the same individual at a same time, because they are dependent the sampling skill and features of the samples themselves. Thus, inconsistent results can be produced. However, comparative quantification PCR using a housekeeping gene, such as \u03b2-actin (ACTB) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), might be suitable for the analysis of these types of respiratory specimens.",

RSV is known to occur in well-defined recurrent epidemics during the cold season in temperate climates [2], whereas in tropical and subtropical areas, RSV infections are reported to peak more often in the wet season. However, locations close to the equator show less consistent patterns, some with almost continuous RSV activity and varying seasonal peaks [25]. In this study, two seasonal peaks of RSV occurred at the changes of seasons from winter to spring and from summer to autumn. This pattern is similar to the previous report [24].",

In this study, we analyzed the clinical presentations of 645 RSV-positive patients (Table 3).

Some studies found no differences in the symptoms of patients infected with the two RSV subtypes [30\u201332]. However, some reported that RSV-A was associated with a more-severe clinical disease [33\u201335], whereas in other studies, RSV-B infections were reported to cause more severe disease [36, 37]. In this study, the LRTIs bronchiolitis (p < 0.001) and dyspnea (p = 0.048), the URTI coryza (p < 0.001), and the gastrointestinal illnesses vomiting (p = 0.001), poor appetite (p < 0.001), and diarrhea (p = 0.005) were more frequently found in the RSV-A-positive patients than in the RSV-B-positive patients. However, the systemic influenza-like symptoms chill (p = 0.01), headache (p = 0.006), myalgia (p = 0.002), and debility (p = 0.006), and rash etc. (p < 0.001) were found more frequently in the RSV-B-positive patients than in the RSV-A-positive patients (Table 3). These data suggest specific clinical presentations for RSV-A and RSV-B infections, and provide clues for the diagnosis and clinical distinction of the different RSV subtypes.",

Viral infections are an important issue that attracts much research attention, and one focus of research is the relationship between the viral load and disease progression or the sensitivity of the disease. In the study of patients chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus, monitoring the homogeneous serum hepatitis B viral DNA levels with sensitive, absolutely quantitative real-time PCR assays is strongly recommended for the management of patients [38]. However, it is still challenging to quantify respiratory viruses in respiratory-tract specimens. Whether the RSV load correlates with disease severity remains controversial, because some previous analyses of hospitalized children have shown a significant association [15, 39\u201341], whereas others have not [42, 43]. The virus was quantified with quantitative RT\u2013PCR, plaque assay, or both in these studies. However, the initial quality of the samples influences their subsequent analysis, and it is difficult to control how many valid cells can be obtained from the respiratory tract. To exclude the effects of sampling, a comparative quantitative analysis of viral load should be used for respiratory specimens to evaluate drug efficacy, therapeutic effects, etc.",

We thus made a limited attempt to analyze the association between CVL and clinical presentation. RSV (-A or -B) and human ACTB were quantified with a standard curve for each. The CVL was then calculated and used for the analysis. In this study, CVL was divided into four levels: < 1, 1\u20138, 8\u201364, and > 64. Significant differences were found in bronchiolitis (p = 0.009) and fever (\u2265 38\u00b0C) (p = 0.001) according to the CVL, with the frequencies declining as the CVL increased (Table 3). The peak frequencies of bronchiolitis and fever occurred in low-CVL patients, which might attributable to the combined effects of the lung damage caused by the virus, the host immunopathological effect, the replication/clearance of the virus, the progression of the disease, etc. [44\u201346]. In the advanced stage of RSV infection, virus is gradually cleared, and immunopathological effect becomes the more important influence factor. While the disease progressions of the patients before hospitalization, like the onset of disease, were not recorded clearly, the shortcoming made it hard to analyze deeply, and more mechanism study must be done to uncover the inner relationship.",
