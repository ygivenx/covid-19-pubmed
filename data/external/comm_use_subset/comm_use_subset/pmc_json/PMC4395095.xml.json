            "text": "\nTalaromyces marneffei (Basionym: Penicillium marneffei) is an opportunistic human fungal pathogen endemic to Southeast Asia and Southern China [1\u20133]. Most cases of T. marneffei infection occur in immune-deficient hosts, especially those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), however, infections have also been reported in non-HIV children with the underlying immune defects (e.g. severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), congenital lymphopenia, hyper-IgM syndrome, and hyper\u2013IgE syndrome). Failure to treat infections is fatal, especially in children with primary immunodeficiency [2, 3]. T. marneffei is a dimorphic fungus with a thermally regulated dimorphic switch. As such, T. marneffei is capable of undergoing a transition from the saprophytic filamentous multicellular hyphae found in the environment (or in vitro at 25\u00b0C) to a unicellular yeast growth form in vitro at 37\u00b0C and during infection. During growth at 25\u00b0C, hyphae can also undergo asexual development (conidiation) to produce conidia, the infectious propagules. Hyphae differentiate by sequential production of an aerial stalk followed by the budding of the metula and phialide cell types from the stalk tip and culminating in the differentiation of conidia, by budding from phialides, to produce long chains of uninucleate asexual spores [4, 5]. Conidia exhibit a green coloration. In related fungal species, conidial coloration is due to the synthesis of DHN-melanin (1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin) produced from polyketides made from acetate precursors [6].",

            "text": "Melanins are hydrophobic pigment biopolymers with a negative charge formed by oxidative polymerization of phenolic or indolic compounds. Generally, melanins present in brown to black colors, however, other colors such as green are found. Melanins act as non-specific shields against various stressors (e.g. UV, oxidizing agents, enzymatic lysis, and extreme high and low temperatures) and play an important role during virulence in fungi [6\u20138]. In plant pathogenic fungi, melanins at the appressoria aid in the penetration of plant tissues [9]. In human pathogenic fungi, melanin protects cells from the harsh environment within the host, including shielding the cells from components of the immune response and antifungal agents [8, 9]. There are three classes of melanins synthesized in fungi; eumelanins, allomelanins, and pheomelanins. The eumelanin DOPA-melanin (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine melanin) and the allomelanin DHN-melanin (1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin) are the two most common melanins in fungi and the best characterized. Both DOPA-melanin and DHN-melanin production requires the action of laccases. Laccase (p-diphenol:dioxygenoxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) is a member of the multicopper oxidase (MCO) family of enzymes. The relationship amongst MCO members correlates with the type of enzyme, its function, and the source organism [10\u201313]. Laccases can catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety of organic (especially aromatic) and inorganic compounds. Laccases oxidize DOPA to dopaquinone that can be used to produce DOPA-melanin [6, 7, 9]. In Cryptococcus neoformans, lac1 encodes a laccase that when deleted leads to mutants being unable to synthesize the brown colored DOPA-melanin and this results in reduced virulence in a mouse infection model [14]. Laccases are also involved in generating the pigmentation of conidia. This pigmentation, which can be observed as a variety of colors, is attributed to DHN-melanin synthesis and requires the activity of a laccase to polymerize 1,8-DHN to form the DHN-melanin polymer [6, 15]. Deletions of the laccases encoded by the Aspergillus nidulans yA and Aspergillus fumigatus abr2 genes result in a lack of the green colored DHN-melanin in conidia [16\u201318]. A. nidulans yA mutants exhibit yellow conidia, whereas A. fumigatus abr2 mutants produce brown conidia [16, 18, 19].",

            "text": "Melanization in T. marneffei has been identified both in vitro and during infection. T. marneffei is capable of synthesizing both DHN- and DOPA-melanin [20\u201322]. The polyketide synthase WA is responsible for DHN-melanin synthesis during asexual development [22]. Laccase activity has been detected in extracts from yeast cells [20] and T. marneffei yeast cells can produce DOPA-melanin using L-DOPA supplemented in culture medium [21]. Both DOPA- and DHN-melanin biosynthetic pathways require the function of laccases [6, 15]. However, the specific laccase(s) required have not been identified and the enzymatic activities necessary for melanin biosynthetic steps have not been verified in detail. To examine the type of melanin occurs during conidiation, the DHN-melanin synthesis inhibitor tricyclazole [23\u201325] was added to the culture medium of T. marneffei grown at 28\u00b0C. It was found that the addition of tricyclazole altered the green coloration of conidia suggesting that the melanin synthesized during T. marneffei conidiation is a DHN-melanin. The genome of the T. marneffei type strain harbors 10 genes that encode multicopper oxidase proteins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that T. marneffei pbrB gene encodes a laccase that shares a common evolutionary origin with fungal laccases functioning in DHN-melanin synthesis. To test this hypothesis we deleted the pbrB gene and characterized its function during growth and development. By analysing the gene expression pattern and protein localization we show that the pbrB gene is required for the synthesis of DHN-melanin in conidia.",

All pyrG+ transformants and the T. marneffei G681 (\u0394pkuA::pyrG\n+) strain used as a control, were maintained on ANM medium containing 1% (w/v) glucose, 10 mM ammonium sulfate [26]. The T. marneffei F4 strain isolated from an AIDS patient (CBS 119456) [29] was maintained on malt extract (ME) agar. Conidial suspensions of transformants and the G526 strain were harvested from conidiating colonies growing on ANM solid medium at 28\u00b0C for 1 week. Colonies on petri dishes were flooded with sterilized phosphate buffer saline, gently scraped, filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem), and recovered by centrifugation.",

To identify laccase encoding genes in T. marneffei the C. neoformans Lac1 and A. fumigatus Abr2 (Fig 2A) encoding genes were used as a query sequence in blast searches of the T. marneffei ATCC 18224 genome sequence (GenBank, NCBI). This identified two highly homologous genes (PMAA_072680 and PMAA_085520) (Cnlac1 homology of 88% and 78%, respectively) that were then also used for additional blast searches to retrieve related sequences in the T. marneffei genome. These homology searches identified 10 genes encoding putative multicopper oxidases (PMAA_008350, PMAA_050860, PMAA_055370, PMAA_057450, PMAA_062880, PMAA_072680, PMAA_082010, PMAA_082060, PMAA_085520, and PMAA_100410). Generally, laccases contain four copper atoms including type1 Cu, type 2 Cu, and a pair of type 3 Cu. The patterns of conserved amino acids coordinated with each type of copper are HXHG, HXH, HCHXXXHXXXM/F/L, and HXXHXH, which occupy the L1\u2013L4 signature sequences starting from the N-terminus [34\u201336]. We found that 9 of the T. marneffei MCOs (excluding PMAA_062880) have these conserved patterns (see S1 Fig). Previous phylogenetic studies reveal that MCO sequences are often clustered with other genes according to function, fungal division, and source organism [10, 11, 13]. To predict which T. marneffei MCO participates in conidial DHN-melanin synthesis, we combined 55 fungal MCO sequences and performed alignments using CLUSTALW (http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/). Tree construction was conducted in MEGA version 6 [37] using the Neighbor-Joining method. The 55 fungal MCO sequences were separated into 5 clades with well-supported branches (>90% bootstrap support) (Fig 2A). Each clade was highlighted and named according to sequences with known functions and fungal divisions. The ascomycete laccase lineage can be divided into 2 clades supported with very high bootstrap values (99% and 100%). Focusing on the second clade containing T. marneffei PbrB, this clade comprises of characterized laccases functioning in conidial DHN-melanin synthesis. T. marneffei PbrB is more closely related to A. fumigatus Abr2 than A. nidulans YA [16\u201318].",

            "text": "The multicopper oxidase (MCO) family comprises enzymes that typically contain four copper atoms classified into three types (type 1 Cu, type 2 Cu and type 3 Cu). Members of MCO family include laccases, ferroxidases, ascorbate oxidases, bilirubin oxidases, CueO, and ceruloplasmin [10, 11, 34, 35]. Among MCO members, laccases can be found in various organisms (e.g. plants, fungi, bacteria and insects), but not in humans. A large number of laccases are produced in many basidiomycete and ascomycete fungal species and a variety of physiological roles have been reported including morphogenesis, stress defense, fungal pathogen/host interaction and delignification [7, 12, 36]. In pathogenic fungi, laccases have attracted attention due to their involvement in melanization and the correlation with host invasion and protection against host immunity. Laccases contribute to the melanization pathways producing the most commonly isolated fungal melanins; DOPA- and DHN-melanin [7, 9]. Generally, melanins are deposited in the cell wall of conidia and fungal cells [6, 15]. This study has determined the role of a developmentally regulated laccase, encoded by pbrB, during DHN-melanin synthesis in conidia. Neither the pbrB transcript nor the GFP-tagged protein in a pbrB(p)::pbrB::GFP strain could be detected during vegetative hyphal or yeast growth. However, GFP fluorescence was observed in conidiophores of the pbrB(p)::pbrB::GFP strain, suggesting that pbrB is only expressed during asexual development in T. marneffei. Likewise in A. fumigatus and A. nidulans, expression of the orthologous abr2 and yA genes characteristically occurs during conidiophore development but not during vegetative growth [16, 18]. Phylogenetic examination showed that T. marneffei PbrB is more closed to A. fumigatus Abr2 than A. nidulans YA (Fig 2A). Moreover, T. marneffei \u0394pbrB colonies displayed brown-pigmented conidia that resemble those of the \u0394abr2 strain [17, 18]. Our data suggests that T. marneffei PbrB is polymerizing polymers of 1,8-DHN to form DHN-melanin, as has been shown in A. fumigatus [39]. T. marneffei pbrB is located within a genomic cluster of genes with homology to those required for conidial pigment biosynthesis in other systems and includes PMAA_082010 (conidial biosynthesis oxidase AbrA), PMAA_082020 (conidial biosynthesis protein AygA), PMAA_082030 (1,3,6,8\u2014tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase ArpA), PMAA_082040 (conidial pigment biosynthesis scytalone dehydrogenase ArpA) and PMAA_082120 (conidial pigment polyketide synthase AlbA) (see S2A Fig). This cluster is conserved in A. fumigatus (S2B Fig).",

            "text": "The biochemical pathway for DHN-melanin production was first described by Wheeler and Bell (1988) and has been well characterized both biochemically and genetically in many ascomycetes. The genus Aspergillus comprises many species and pigmented conidia appear in various colors among species. Effects of inhibitors on DHN-melanin synthesis (using tricyclazole and phthalide) and DOPA-melanin synthesis (using kojic acid and tropolone) in a range of Aspergillus species demonstrate that differences in the amounts and types of pigments and melanins synthesized by related species are likely to be a common theme [40, 41]. Among Aspergillus and Penicillium species, most exhibit green to bluish green conidial pigments and the use of inhibitors of melanization pathways has revealed that most of these pigments are made from pentaketide metabolites [41]. The starting carbon units are acetate [25, 42], malonyl CoA and/or acetyl CoA [6, 15, 43] and are catalyzed by a polyketide synthase (PKS) in the first step before subsequent processing through enzymatic steps to produce DHN-melanin [6, 9, 12, 23]. Mutation of the gene encoding the PKS in A. nidulans (wA), A. fumigatus (pksP) and T. marneffei (wA) similarly results in white, non-melanized conidia [44, 45, 22]. While this early part of the pathway seems to be conserved amongst these fungi, differing results have been shown when tests are conducted with the DHN-melanin synthesis inhibitor tricyclazole. Tricyclazole specifically affects the reductases that reduce 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene to scytalone and 1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene to vermelone [23\u201325, 46]. Tricyclazole alters the conidial color phenotype of A. fumigatus but it does not affect conidial coloration of A. nidulans, A. flavus, and A. parasiticus [41, 47]. Further studies showed that the conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. fumigatus and A. nidulans possess some steps that are distinct from the general model of DHN-melanin biosynthetic pathway (Fig 8) [6, 15]. Instead of producing tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) from the starter units, A. nidulans and A. fumigatus utilize malonyl CoA and Acetyl CoA to produce heptaketide naphthopyrone YWA1 by heptaketide synthase (HKS) [44, 48]. Although YWA1 is a precursor for green conidial pigmentation in both A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, the downstream metabolic steps are different in the two organisms. In A. nidulans, YA laccase catalyzes YWA1 to produce the green pigment of conidia. In contrast, A. fumigatus YWA1 is catalyzed through a hydrolytic polyketide-based shortening step to produce 1,3,6,8-THN by Ayg1 [49]. A homolog of A. fumigatus ayg1 is also presents in T. marneffei genome (see S2 Fig). As the addition of tricyclazole affected conidial color of T. marneffei, it suggests that hydroxynaphthalene reductases function in DHN-melanin synthetic pathway (Fig 8). Similar to A. fumigatus, YWA1 should be converted to 1,3,6,8-THN in T. marneffei. Then 1,3,6,8-THN is processed through additional steps to produce 1,8-DHN. Finally, 1,8-DHN is polymerized by PbrB laccase to form DHN-melanin, which appears as the green color of T. marneffei conidia (Fig 8).",
