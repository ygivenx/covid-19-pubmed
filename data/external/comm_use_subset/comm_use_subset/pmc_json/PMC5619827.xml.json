Following their initial identification as antiviral modulators of Influenza virus infection in a functional genomic screen [6], several studies have concurred in establishing IFITM1, 2 and 3 (hereafter referred to as IFITMs) as key components of cellular innate defenses with large antiviral spectrum (acting against Influenza virus, Filoviruses, Coronaviruses, HIV etc. [6\u201315, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22\u201328] [29\u201333]",

In this setting, IFITMs sequester incoming virion particles in endosomes by preventing viral-to-cellular membrane fusion, a phenomenon that first impedes the access of the virus to the cell cytoplasm and subsequently leads to its degradation [6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 20, 23\u201325, 34\u201339]. It is interesting to note that this mechanism of inhibition, albeit with efficacies that depend on both the IFITM and the virus considered, targets viruses for which the passage through the acidic pH of endosomes is mandatory to trigger viral-to-cellular membranes fusion, as well as those for which this passage is not obligatory, as HIV-1 [23, 40, 41, 42].",

This novel antiviral effect that we refer to as a negative imprinting of the viral particle infectivity is independent of the cell type in which viruses are produced, as it is observed in established cell lines and in primary cell targets of HIV-1 replication, such as T cells [19, 22] and macrophages [18]. Altogether, these data along with data in the literature suggests that, at least in the case of HIV-1, IFITMs bears the ability to inhibit the virus life cycle at two distinct moments: i) during viral entry in target cells, step in which IFITMs intervene by trapping incoming virions in endosomal vesicles; ii) during virion particle assembly, phase in which the presence of IFITMs leads to the production of virions of reduced infectivity.",

In addition, we highlight viruses that are either fully resistant to IFITMs (HCV, RVFV, MOPV along with AAV), or that display an exquisite IFITM member-specific susceptibility (DUGV, EBV). This heterogeneous behavior allowed us to use genetic elements swapping between IFITM-resistant and \u2013susceptible viruses and to point to the specificities in the mode of virion assembly rather than to the viral glycoprotein as a dominant factor of susceptibility towards IFITMs. However, in agreement with recent studies in the literature [23, 47, 48], we also show that, contrarily to X4-tropic, R5-tropic HIV-1 strains become resistant to IFITM3, likely underlying a novel role for co-receptors in the interplay between HIV and IFITMs. Finally, we have re-examined the effects played by IFITMs during spreading infections and we now reveal that they are mechanistically due to the concurrent action exerted by IFITMs both in target cells protection and in the production of virions of reduced infectivity. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of antiviral factor capable of targeting both extremes of a virus life cycle.",

Given these discrepancies, it was important to determine whether IFITMs could modify or not the extent of mature glycoproteins incorporation in the case of other viruses. To this end, we examined the extent of mature glycoproteins incorporation in virion particles derived from viruses for which antibodies were available (Fig 2B). No specific defect in mature glycoproteins incorporation into virions was observed in the presence of IFITMs, irrespectively of the glycoprotein intracellular processing/maturation pathway (schematically displayed at the right of the panels of Fig 2B), refuting the hypothesis of a generalized mechanism through which IFITMs may interact and/or modify viral glycoproteins maturation and incorporation into virions.",

The reasons for these differences are unclear although both patterns are equally present in the literature and both have been indistinctly linked to an antiviral phenotype [6, 8, 18, 19, 25, 45, 54]. Second, slower migrating forms of IFITMs, especially of IFITM2, can be in some cases observed in cellular and viral fractions. These bands have been observed before, but at present their identity is unknown, although we speculate they may represent post translational modifications of IFITMs. The finding that such forms appear more concentrated in viral preparations of some viruses may suggest their selective enrichment at the sites of virion assembly, an hypothesis that will require further studies.",

SupT1 cells stably expressing IFITM1, 2 or 3 were infected with HIV-1 and VSV for prolonged periods of time to obtain sufficient amounts of released virion particles produced in the presence of IFITM proteins. Viral preparations were then separated in two and either subjected to CD45 depletion or not. After CD45-magnetic beads removal, virions were purified by ultracentrifugation and upon normalization, they were analyzed by WB and infectivity (Fig 5). CD45 depletion worked efficiently and as our laboratory published before in the case of HIV-1 most of the virion-associated IFITMs signal persisted in the viral fractions, even after CD45 depletion [18]. These results however extend our previous findings indicating that even in the case of VSV, IFITMs become essentially virion-associated in cells undergoing active viral budding. When the infectivity of non-depleted and CD45-depleted virions was analyzed no differences were observed, thereby excluding a possible confounding role of exosomes that may be present in our viral preparations.",

IFN-stimulation was not used to further increase the levels of expression of IFITMs, due to its pleiotropic effects on the cell physiology that would have complicated the analysis of the results obtained. Knockdown cells were then challenged with the indicated viruses and newly-produced virion particles assembled in the absence or presence of endogenous IFITMs were then purified, normalized and their infectivity assessed (according to the scheme provided in Fig 6A). In the case of EBOV infection of primary macrophages silenced for IFITMs, only viral spread could be analyzed due to the limited amount of material available.",

As expected, the intracellular reduction of IFITMs, led to a concomitant reduction in the amount of virion-associated IFITMs. When newly-produced virion particles were normalized and used to challenge target cells, the infectivity of virions produced in IFITM-knockdown cells reproducibly increased for all the three viruses tested (VSV, MeV and HIV-1, in this latter case completing the analysis that we had already performed for primary macrophages [18]). Thus, removal of endogenous IFITM proteins results in an increase in the intrinsic infectivity of virion particles, corroborating the results presented in Fig 4. In the case of EBOV, silencing of IFITMs in primary macrophages led to a consistent increase in the replicative capacity of EBOV in the cell culture (Fig 6C displays a single time point of the complete analysis of viral spread over time presented in Supplementary S5 Fig), although the limited material available precluded the purification and the subsequent analysis of the infectivity of newly-produced virions and therefore prevented the assignment, or dismissal, of the antiviral effect of IFITMs on EBOV to a specific mechanism (this issue is addressed in the next figure).",

As expected, induction of IFITM3 reduced the spread of every virus tested, although the magnitude of the reduction varied (Fig 7B). To quantify the ability of IFITM3 to protect cells against incoming viruses, cells were challenged at day 0, at a time when secondary infection remains negligible. In this case, high viral doses and a short time analysis of infected cells post challenge were used to appreciate in as much as possible the antiviral effects on a single cycle basis (Fig 7C). Under these conditions and as expected from data in the field, expression of IFITM3 was associated to a statistically significant protection of target cells (from 1.3 to 4.3 fold). Very variable inhibition rates have been reported for different viruses across different studies, in some instances higher than what we describe here. We believe these differences are mainly due to the heterogeneity of the experimental systems used (cell types, IFITM expression levels, use of pseudovirions versus replication-competent viruses, time of analysis, etc).",

In particular, HIV-1 envelope molecules with R5-tropism have been shown to display near complete resistance to IFITM3 [23, 47, 48]. To determine whether this was the case here, we introduced CCR5 by retroviral-mediated gene transduction in the IFITM3-stable SupT1 cells used in Fig 7 and we challenged these cells with the following R5-tropic HIV-1 strains: NL-AD8 that contains an R5-tropic envelope in the context of an otherwise NL4-3 proviral clone; three transmitted founder viruses that have been obtained by single-genome amplification in [61]. The four viruses tested replicated well irrespectively of the presence of IFITM3 (Fig 9A) and when virion particles produced during spreading infection were isolated, normalized and analyzed for their infectivity on a single cycle of infection basis, no defects were observed (Fig 9B). These results thus, confirm previous reports with respect to the resistance of R5-tropic viruses to IFITM3 [23, 47, 48] and indicate that the ability to use different entry molecules and/or entry pathways may play an important modulatory role in the susceptibility of different viruses towards these restriction factors.",

It is worth noticing that the comparison between the effects reported here and those described in the literature (Fig 10) reveals a largely concordant behavior, albeit with few exceptions likely driven by the heterogeneity of the experimental systems used across studies, in that viruses susceptible to IFITMs in target cells are also so during viral particle production.

It remains however unclear whether the physical incorporation of IFITMs into virion particles is required for their antiviral effect, or whether these two properties can be dissociated. While a thorough mutagenic study of IFITM proteins that may dissociate the two properties will likely be required to formally address this question, several lines of evidence stemming from our comparative study support the notion that the incorporation of IFITMs into virions can indeed be separated from their antiviral effects. First, virion packaging is not predictive of the antiviral effects of IFITMs (i.e. it is not sufficient), as HCV, RVFV, MOPV, as well as EBV and DUGV in the case of specific IFITM members, do not display detectable infectivity defects. Second, an antiviral effect can be observed even in the absence of IFITM incorporation, as is the case for DUGV virions produced in the presence of IFITM1. These considerations lend support to a model whereby IFITM-packaging and IFITM-mediated imprinting of viral particles can be at least in some cases uncoupled and suggests that the imprinting effect of IFITMs takes place in the cell itself, during the process of virion particles formation.",

While it remains possible that the experimental setup used here may not have allowed us to finely appreciate differences between individual IFITM members, our results indicate that even the most internally distributed IFITM members (IFITM2 and 3) are clearly present at the plasma membrane of non-permeabilized cells. This suggests that the steady state distribution of IFITM proteins may provide only a limited overview of what is likely to be instead a more complicated process. Indeed, virion assembly and membrane trafficking are highly dynamic processes and the very association of IFITMs to membranes is regulated by an intricate network of regulatory modifications and interactions with cellular co-factors (adaptor protein 2, AP2, the E3-ubiqutin ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4, NEDD4, Fyn [20, 36, 37]. In light of these considerations, we do believe that the complex dynamics of membrane trafficking are likely to facilitate the encounter between individual IFITM members and viruses assembling at different intracellular locations, likely explaining the results obtained here.",

Despite our intensive efforts not all viral systems proved amenable to functional swapping, so that we used a previously described pseudo-particle system based on an HIV core incorporating E1/E2-HCV glycoproteins [60] and we developed a novel one based on a VSV core packaging GnGc-RVFV. The results we have obtained indicate that the mode of virion assembly intended here as the plethora of viral proteins that orchestrate the production of novel virion particles constitute the dominant determinant of susceptibility to IFITMs. In this respect, the possibility that IFITM-resistant viruses may code for natural antagonists of IFITMs is of high potential interest. The data obtained in our study seem to exclude a degradation-based antagonism, since no detectable depletion of IFITMs is observed in either cell- or virion-associated samples of HCV, RVFV or MOPV viruses. However, antagonism can be established in other manners for instance through the induction of specific post-translational modifications that affect the normal antiviral behavior of IFITMs. At present, this hypothesis remains of interest, but requires further experimental work.",

The results obtained here with R5-tropic viruses also concur with this conclusion, indicating that R5-tropic viruses resist IFITM3, at least when expressed in T cells [23, 47, 64]. At present, it remains unclear how entry through CCR5 rather than CXCR4 would be so different as to drive such opposite outcomes, but two further considerations may help completing the canvas. First, co-receptor usage is often coupled with different affinities for CD4, so that both parameters may be of importance with respect to the behaviour towards IFITMs. Second, in our previous study we have shown that endogenous IFITMs silencing in primary macrophages increases the infectivity of R5-tropic HIV-1 [23, 47, 64], indicating that co-receptor usage and infection outcome may also be finely dependent on the cell type. This would not be unprecedented as for instance primary macrophages resist X4-tropic virus infection despite the presence of the appropriate co-receptor. Taken together, we believe that these results indicate that changes in co-receptor usage coupled to different affinities for CD4 may influence the outcome of infection with respect to IFITMs in a cell type dependent manner. Whether this occurs or not remains to be determined, however these experimental observations certainly reveal the presence of an additional layer of complexity in the relationship between HIV and IFITMs that it would be of interest to explore in other viral settings.",

            "text": "While we have not measured it directly due to the lack of robust viral entry systems for most of the viruses used here, IFITMs have always been reported to act by altering the fusogenic properties of cellular or of viral membranes with their opposite counterpart [18, 19, 22, 34, 35, 43]. Considering that viral membranes are ultimately derived from the cell, we favor the hypothesis according to which IFITMs act using a single molecular mechanism that modifies cellular membranes to yield to two distinct outcomes: an effect in target cells and an effect on newly-produced virions. Not much is known about the molecular mechanisms through which IFITMs act, but at least two interesting cellular proteins have been described to be potentially involved in their antiviral effects: VAPA, a key regulator of the lipid composition of cellular membranes that is posited at ER-Golgi interfaces [44] and more recently ZMPSTE24 that acts as an endoprotease within the cell [46]. The role of these cellular co-factors in the antiviral mechanisms of inhibition of IFITMs remains to be wholly elucidated, but it is easy to envision how modifications in either the protein or lipid composition of cellular (and therefore viral) membranes could provide a broad mechanism of interference with a large spectrum of viruses. If this hypothesis is correct, the protection provided by some HIV-1 glycoproteins Env may be due to their increased propensity to acquire a fusion-prone conformation or to their lower requirement for intramembrane movements upon the engagement of the appropriate cellular receptors.",
