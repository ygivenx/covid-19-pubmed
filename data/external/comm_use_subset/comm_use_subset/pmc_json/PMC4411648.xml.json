The importance of exploiting such tools has been highlighted numerous times during the development of the new healthcare system in England: Public Health England included improved data sharing as one of its key priorities for strengthening public health surveillance [2], and NHS England and the Health and Social Care Information Centre are aiming to link data for patients across health and social care systems through the development of the care.data service [3]. However, the process of linking datasets that have not been designed with this objective in mind can be complex, as there is not always a consistent unique identifier that can be used to match a record from one database to a corresponding record for the same patient (or encounter, depending on the purpose), in another database. Data structures often differ, requiring multiple entries to be matched to a single row in another database, and completeness of key linking fields is not always prioritized in data entry.",
