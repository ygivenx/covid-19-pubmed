            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (Picornaviridae) are the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infection (or common cold) and are responsible for more than half of all cases of the common cold [1,2]. They are also associated with more severe diseases such as acute otitis media in children [3] and sinusitis in adults [4]. HRVs can also cause severe lower respiratory tract symptoms such as pneumonia, wheezing, bronchiolitis, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in infants and children as well as fatal pneumonia in elderly and immunocompromised adults [1,2]. Although HRV-induced upper respiratory illness is often mild and self-limiting, the socioeconomic burden caused by medical visits and missed school and work by HRV infection is enormous [2,5,6]. The degree of drug misuse and abuse is significant and antihistamine and antibiotic usages have caused many side effects [7]. Attempts to develop effective treatments or vaccination have been relatively limited and unsuccessful because of more than 100 serotypes of HRV [1,2,8]. There is a need for the development of selective antiviral agents with novel target sites to establish an effective HRV management strategy and tactics because currently no effective antiviral therapies have been approved for either the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by HRV infection [2].",

Certain plant preparations and their constituents are regarded as potential sources for commercial antiviral products for prevention or treatment of HRV infection. Previous studies have shown that a methanol extract from the root of Chinese peony, Paeonia lactiflora Pallas (Paeoniaceae), possessed good antiviral activity toward HRV-2 and HRV-4. No work has been obtained concerning the potential use of P. lactiflora to manage HRV, although historically P. lactiflora root (2\u20134 g of dried root/3 times/day) is used as analgesic, hemostyptic, and bacteriostatic agents [13,14].",

The antiviral activities of these materials were compared with those of ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent currently used clinically to treat various DNA and RNA virus infections [15]. The antiviral properties and mechanisms of action of the constituents also were elucidated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with SYBR Green dye and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).",

For isolation of active principles, viral CPE inhibition assay [18] toward HRV-4 in HeLa cell was used. The hexane-soluble fraction was most biologically active (Table 1) and was chromatographed as described previously [17]. Finally, an active principle 1 (94 mg) was isolated at a retention time of 10.9 min. The other active ethyl acetate-soluble fraction (8 g) was chromatographed on a 55 \u00d7 5 cm silica gel column (550 g) by elution with a gradient of chloroform and methanol [100:0 (1 L), 99:1 (1 L), 95:5 (1 L), 90:10 (2 L), 80:20 (1 L), 70:30 (1 L), and 0:100 (1 L) by volume] to provide eight fractions (each about 1 L). Column fractions were monitored by TLC on silica gel plates developed with chloroform and methanol (7:3 by volume) mobile phase. Fractions with similar R\nf values on the TLC plates were pooled. Active fractions 4 to 5 (EI, 2.44 g) and 7 (EII, 0.569 g) were obtained. The active fraction EI was rechromatographed on a silica gel column by elution with chloroform and methanol (70:30 by volume) to give nine fractions (each about 450 mL). A preparative HPLC was used for separation of constituents from the active fractions 3 to 5 (0.176 g). The column was a 4.6 mm i.d. \u00d7 150 mm Eclipse XDB-C18 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using a mobile phase of methanol and water (3:7 by volume) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Chromatographic separations were monitored using a UV detector at 260 nm. Finally, an active principle 2 (75 mg) was isolated at a retention time of 4.83 min. Fraction EII was purified by RP-TLC with chloroform:methanol:water (70:25:5 by volume) to afford an active principle 3 (R\nf = 0.72, 45 mg). The three antiviral principles were characterized as paeonol (PA) (1), gallic acid (GA) (2), and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranose (PGG) (3) (Fig 1) by spectroscopic analyses, including MS and NMR. PA (1): compound 1 was isolated as an antibacterial principle from P. lactiflora root in our previous work [17], and the spectral data of compound 1 was largely identical to the published data [17]. GA (2) was identified on the basis of the following evidence: white powder. UV (MeOH): \u03bbmax nm = 260. FT-IR: v\nmax cm\u20131 = 3491\u20133063 (OH stretch), 1608 (aromatic C = C). EI-MS (70eV), m/z (% relative intensity): 170.1 [M]+ (100), 153 (66.1), 125 (11.6), 124 (3), 107 (3.2), 79 (6.5), 78 (2.1). 1H NMR (CD3OD, 600 MHz): \u03b4 7.03 (2H, s). 13C NMR (CD3OD, 150 MHz): \u03b4 110.4 d, 122.1 s, 139.7 s, 146.5 s, 170.6 s. The interpretations of proton and carbon signals of compound 2 were largely consistent with those of Sakar et al. [19].

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using 1 \u03bcg total RNA through a reverse transcription reaction using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Five log10-fold dilutions of cDNA for each RNA were performed to determine PCR efficiency (100 ng\u201310 pg per reaction). qRT-PCR was performed in 96-well plates using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA).

These constituents exhibited antiviral activity toward both group A (HRV-2) and group B (HRV-4). IC50 of PGG, GA, and PA toward two HRVs was between 11.56 and 17.89 \u03bcM, between 426.99 and 448.10 \u03bcM, and between 492.17 and 608.38 \u03bcM, respectively, although IC50 of the natural compounds stated previously is between 0.22 and 294.55 \u03bcM. PGG exhibited greater antiviral activity than ribavirin (IC50, 240.49\u2013324.07 \u03bcM) toward two HRVs and high selectivity. The virus titration assay results also proved that the constituents had antiviral activity toward the HRVs. This original finding indicates that materials derived from P. lactiflora root can hold promise for the development of novel and effective naturally occurring antiviral agents for two different HRV groups A and B. PGG was reported to possess antiviral activity toward hepatitis B virus [37] and influenza A virus [38].",

            "text": "Investigations on the modes of action of natural antivirals may contribute to the development of selective HRV therapeutic alternatives with novel target sites. The modes of antiviral action of plant secondary substances have been well documented by Rollinger and Schmidtke [1] and Kitazato et al. [39]. Targeting virus molecules is likely more specific and less toxic, but there is a narrow spectrum of viruses and a higher risk of creating resistant viruses [39]. On the contrary, chemicals which target cellular molecules may possess a broader antiviral activity spectrum and less risk of developing virus resistance, but may be more toxic to the host cell [39]. In the current study, PGG and PA do not interact with the HRV-4 particles, as preexposure of the virus to the constituents did not alter the infectivity of HRV-4 particles. Based on time-course tests, PGG and PA can inhibit HRV-4 infection only when they were added during the virus inoculation (0 h), but not after 1 h or later. This finding suggests that PGG and PA may interact with the human cells in the early stage of HRV infections to protect the cells from the virus destruction. The mechanism of action of these constituents on cellular protection toward HRV-4 still remains unclear, although ribavirin was reported to enter host cells through nucleoside transporters in several studies [40,41]. In addition, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the RNA replication levels of HRVs were remarkably reduced in the MRC5 cultures treated with these constituents. This finding suggests that PGG and PA may block or reduce the entry of the viruses into the cells in the early stage of HRV infections to protect the cells from the virus destruction and abate virus replication. Detailed tests are needed to fully understand the modes of action of the constituents. It has been suggested that the mode of anti-HRV action of gallic acid might be derived from the inhibition of virus absorption [35].",

            "text": "Interference with specific virus-host cell receptor interactions can be one of the potential interventions in antiviral chemotherapy [42]. HRVs are classified into the major and minor groups, based on their binding to ICAM-1 [43,44] or to members of the LDLR family [45], respectively. ICAM-1 is a critical target-docking molecule on epithelial cells for 90% of the HRV serotypes [43,44]. The major group uses ICAM-1 as a mechanism to gain entry to the host cell [46]. It has been suggested that antagonism of the virus-receptor interaction would appear to be an effective way to inhibit a broad spectrum of HRVs [47]. Macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin inhibit infection by the major group of HRVs via a reduction in ICAM-1 expression [48]. mICAM-1 expression is equally induced by both major and minor group HRVs [49]. The HRV-induced ICAM-1 up-regulation is not receptor-restricted [49]. Moreover, it has been reported that pretreatment of HRV-2 with sICAM did not alter the ability of HRV-2 to induce ICAM-1 [46]. The current experiments demonstrated that both HRV-2 and HRV-4 induced the both forms of ICAM-1 expressed in MRC5. ELISA results revealed that sICAM-1 protein levels of infected cultures treated with PA or PGG were significantly lower than those in cultures without the compound treatment, although there was no difference in sICAm-1 levels between mock cultures with or without the constituents. However, ICAM-1 mRNA expression levels were decreased in the presence of PGG or PA in both infected and noninfected cell cultures. The findings indicated that these constituents interfered with host cell protein expression of this receptor through inhibition of the receptor RNA expression or reduction of HRV replication. In addition, LDLR mRNA expressions were also reduced in the presence of PGG and PA in the cultures. However, LDLR protein expression was inhibited in PGG treatment only. The findings suggest that PGG interfere with LDLR expression through inhibiting expression of LDLR RNA or reduction of HRV replication, whereas PA interfered with LDLR expression through only reduction of HRV replication. PA was reported to suppress ICAM-1 expression in TNF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells [50].",

            "text": "HRV infection induces the production of numerous components of innate immunity including TLR3 and imflamatory mediators, such as kinins, leukotrienes, histamine, interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8), TNF, and regulated by activation normal T cell expressed and secreted [2,51]. The surface-expressed TLR3s were reported to have an important function in response to a common human viral infection of natural host cells and play an important role in innate immune responses toward HRV infection [52,53]. During the replication cycle of HRV, viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is recognized by TLR3 [2]. The interaction between dsRNA and TLR3 activates a signaling cascade that triggers increase of cytokine production in host cells and stimulates innate immune responses [2]. It was supposed that inhibition of TLR3 expression have potential modulatory effects on the pathophysiologic changes related to HRV infection [53]. Cytokines such as TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 induce upregulation expression of the adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 in both epithelial and vascular endothelial cells, thereby increasing cell susceptibility to HRV infection [54]. The concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in nasal secretions correlate with the severity of the symptoms in patients with colds [55]. HRV infections were reported to be responsible for triggering exacerbations of asthma through inducing gene expression of these cytokines in asthmatic subjects [56]. ELISA results revealed that PA induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression. Therefore, the expression levels in the infected cell cultures treated with PA were lower than those in the infected cell cultures without the constituent as a consequence of the HRV replication reductions. PGG reduced IL-6 and IL-8 expression and the decreases of expression levels in the infected cell cultures treated with PGG were resulted from the interference of the constituent with both of host cell protein expression and HRV replication. The current study also indicated that the constituents reduced expressions of TLR3 and cytokines, such as TNF, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2, which resulted in diminishing symptoms induced by HRV. It may be that effects of the constituents on blocking or reducing the entry of the viruses into the cells, which results in reducing HRV-RNA replications, play an important role in interfering with HRV-induced gene expression.",
