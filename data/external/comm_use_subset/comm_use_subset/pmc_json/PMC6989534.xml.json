            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most important viruses responsible for water born epidemics (Kamar et al., 2014). It is primarily transmitted through the faeco-oral contaminated drinking water. HEV was discovered in 1983 in an outbreak of unexplained hepatitis in Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan. Although, HEV is more prevalent in developing countries due to poor sanitation and water supplies (Cao and Meng, 2012) however, cases of HEV infection in industrialized countries like Europe, USA and Japan are becoming more common (Minuk et al., 2007; Bendall et al., 2008; Mushahwar, 2008). HEV causes self-limiting acute infection in approximately 20 million people annually, with a global mortality rate of 3% (Jameel, 1999; Nan and Zhang, 2016). This mortality rate remarkably increases up to 30% in the infected pregnant women in their third trimester due to fulminant liver failure (Navaneethan et al., 2008; Aggarwal and Naik, 2009). Infection with HEV represents an important global public health problem due to significant morbidity and mortality (Gupta and Agarwala, 2018). Currently a vaccine has been developed but licensed only in China, thus there is no vaccine or therapeutics available against HEV infection elsewhere. Also, there is no accepted treatment for HEV but the treatments of both interferon and/or ribavirin as a combinatorial therapy have been used successfully to treat chronic HEV infection (Kamar et al., 2014), though it has some side effects.",

            "text": "Genetically, HEV genome is a non-enveloped single-stranded positive sense RNA of ~7.2 kb long and contains three partially overlapping open reading frames ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 (Tam et al., 1991; Tsarev et al., 1992; Ahmad et al., 2011). HEV ORF3 translates into a small phospho-protein that modulates some of the host-regulatory functions including establishment of infection and virion egress (Graff et al., 2005; Chandra et al., 2008; Yamada et al., 2009). ORF2 forms a 660 amino acid (72 kDa) protein and its processed form constitutes the viral capsid. ORF1 is the largest ORF, 5,109 bases long and translated into 1,693 amino acids, which encode the non-structural polyprotein of ~186 kDa, essential for viral replication (Ansari et al., 2000). Computational analysis of ORF1 has identified seven putative domains (Koonin et al., 1992). These include an active methyltransferase domain (Met), Y domain (Y) (Parvez, 2017), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) (Parvez, 2013; Paliwal et al., 2014), a proline -rich region that contains a hypervariable region (H), X -domain (X), helicase (Hel), and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) From N- to C-terminal (Koonin et al., 1992; Parvez, 2017). Except PCP and Y domain, all other putative domains have been partially characterized and their functions have been predicted bioinformatically and some of them even experimentally (Agrawal et al., 2001; Magden et al., 2001; Karpe and Lole, 2010a,b). A recent report has identified an additional ORF4 in genotype-1 HEV, which is presumed to play an essential role in viral replication (Nair et al., 2016).",

Expression of ORF1 in cell free system and the bacteria showed a 186 kDa polyprotein (Ansari et al., 2000) while the same construct, expressed using vaccinia virus showed two fragments of 107 kDa and 78 kDa in HepG2 cell (Ropp et al., 2000). In another study, transfection of infectious HEV RNA into HepG2 cells showed processed ORF1 fragments, of 35, 38, and 36 kDa using anti-MetT, anti-Hel and anti-RdRp antibodies, respectively (Panda et al., 2000). Similarly expression of ORF1 using baculovirus system showed processing of ORF1 as eight fragments that was inhibited by cell permeable cysteine protease inhibitor (E-64d) (Sehgal et al., 2006) but this could not be concluded whether the ORF1 processing was due to HEV-protease or an host-encoded protease. In recent report the role of host factor Xa and thrombin was postulated to initiate the HEV ORF1 processing but it still needs further validation (Kanade et al., 2018). Recently, mutation in conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the putative protease inhibits its proteolytic activity indicating its role in ORF1 processing and viral replication (Paliwal et al., 2014).",

The main goal of our study has been to validate the nature of HEV-protease and established its role in the polyprotein processing. Since, other viral proteases have been identified as a potent antiviral target in literature (Lv et al., 2015) hence, HEV-prorease was thought to be a putative inhibitor for HEV replication. Therefore, we report the expression of a soluble, catalytically active recombinant HEV protease using baculovirus system. Further, we developed highly sensitive and reliable cell free assays to screen the cysteine protease activity. Also a 3D model of the HEV protease was generated to identify possible active sites and the residues responsible for binding of inhibitors. We considered the HEV-protease to be a Papain like cysteine protease. Collectively, this study significantly advances our understanding of the structure and function of HEV protease.",

The purified HEV-protease amplicon was cloned in pFastBac/CT-TOPO vector in frame with 6xHis at C-terminal, under polyhedrin (PH) promoter (Figure 1B). Screening of selected clones by PCR using gene specific primers confirmed integration of desired sequence (Figure 1C). Further, DNA sequencing confirmed the clone in correct reading frame with 100% similarity to the PCP sequences of the genotype-1 of HEV (Supplementary Figure 1, Data Sheets 2, 3). Transformation of pFastBac-PCP in DH10Bac cells resulted in the formation of recombinant bacmid carrying HEV-protease sequence under the PH promoter and the recombination was confirmed through PCR (Figure 1D). Hence, a recombinant baculovirus containing the HEV-protease expression cassette was formed by transfecting the recombinant bacmid into Sf21 insect cells. Transfection leads to cell enlargement, granulation, and vacuole formation after 72 h. Integration of HEV-protease was confirmed by PCR from baculovirus genomic (Figure 1E).",

To confirm the processing of ORF1, digested samples were immunoblotted using anti-MeT, anti-protease, anti-RdRp and anti-Hel antibodies (Table 1). Approximately 35, 20, 55, and 27 kDa size of bands were visualized with anti-Met, anti-protease, anti-RdRp and anti-Hel antibodies corresponding to the size of putative domain of methyletransferase (Figure 5B, lane 3\u20135), protease (Figure 5C, lane 3\u20135), RdRp (Figure 5D, lane 3\u20135), and Helicase (Figure 5E, lane 3\u20135).

The residues present in the predicted active site cleft were Gln479, Thr482, Cys483, Val507, Asp508, Leu582, Pro509, Ile561, Glu588, Arg589, His590, Asn591, Leu592, Met474, Lys457, Leu476, Phe575, and Gly478. A \u201cCysteine(Cys)-Histidine(His)-Asparagine(Asn)\u201d catalytic triads has also been seen between N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal \u03b2-sheet domain.Cys483-His590-Asn591 residues were found to be involved in this catalytic triad, which is the main characteristic of the \u201cpapain\u201d family. One Di-sulfide bond observed between Cys434 and Cys481 necessary for stability and the proper folding of the protein. Residues present in CTC motif (Cys481 and Cys483) and CHC motif (Cys457 and Cys 459) may be involved in zinc metal ion coordination and catalysis (Figure 9A). It is reported that the Zn binding site present on the opposite side of active site (Herold et al., 1999), which even validated by crystal structure of hepatitis C virus NS3 proteases (Stempniak et al., 1997; Barbato et al., 1999; Arasappan et al., 2005) picornavirus 2A (Yu and Lloyd, 1992) PL1pro of HCoV-229E (Ziebuhr et al., 2007), p150 of RUBV (Zhou et al., 2007), and Lpro of FMDV (Guarne et al., 2000). The diagrammatic representation indicates presence of CHC motif, opposite to the predicted active site, could be zinc binding site of HEV-protease (Figure 9).",

Results summarized in Table 2 showed that most of the active compounds had good agreement between the docking score and experimental results (r2 \u2248 0.75). It suggests that the parameters of docking simulations and quality of structural model are good in reproducing experimental course of these compounds in the modeled HEV PCP. The observed difference among E64 docking scores and interacting residues may be due to difference in binding affinity of different inhibitors as observed in inhibitory efficiency. Four inhibitors (E64, Chymostatin, Leupeptin, and ALLN) showed good ligand\u2013receptor interactions that correlated better with the enzyme inhibition activity of recombinant HEV PCP protein with Glide docking (Table 2). Docking result shows that cysteine protease inhibitors E64, Chymostatin, Leupeptin, and ALLN (docking score \u22126, \u22125.1, \u22125.8, \u22124.3 respectively) have strong binding affinity. Result of E64 docking shows that strong H-bond interactions formed with backbone oxygen of Leu477and Lys475 and side chain OE2 atom of Glu 586 and nine hydrophobic interactions observed with Met474, Gln479, Cys483, Ala513, Val507, Ile561, His590, Asn591, Leu592, Arg589, Leu581, residues (Table 3). All inhibitors bound to the HEV PCP active site in a manner similar to the inhibitor E64 (Figure 10). In Chymostatin five H-bond interactions formed, two with backbone oxygen of Met474 and Leu477 and one nitrogen atom of Asn591, whereas two side chain H-bond interactions were observed with oxygen atom of Glu479 and Thr482 and eight hydrophobic interactions were observed with Val507, His590, Leu592, Phe576, Glu586, Leu581, Glu583, Leu535 residues. Leupeptin had an H-bond with backbone oxygen of Asn591 and twelve hydrophobic interactions observed with Gln479, Met474, Thr482, Ala513, Val507, Ile517, Ile561, Phe576, His590, Leu592, Arg589, Leu581 residues. Inhibitor ALLN showed two side chain interactions with nitrogen atom of Glu479 and oxygen atom of Glu583, respectively. Eight hydrophobic interactions observed with Val507, His590, Leu592, Arg589, Leu581, Asn591 residues. Among the remaining inhibitors, PMSF Phosparamidon and AEBSF which were found to be inactive in the HEV PCP enzyme inhibition assay, ligand\u2013receptor interaction analysis showed that inhibitor PMSF and Phosparamidon did not formed H-bond interactions (Table 3). Three inhibitors AEBSF, Bestatin and Pepstatin showed week H-bond and hydrohobic interactions. Interestingly, two inhibitors EDTA and Antipain which were inactive in experimental results remain undocked.",

            "text": "In previous study HEV protease was expressed from different genotype of HEV in E. coli (Accession no: FJ457024 region 440-610) containing extra 9 amino acid (SFDASQSTM) at the C-terminal region have 170 amino acids. This refolded protein was also found to be active and classified as chymotrypsin like protease (Paliwal et al., 2014). In the present study a 161 amino acid long protein of Accession no: AF444002_1 region 432-592 of genotype1, similar to the one predicted by putative domain of HEV (Koonin et al., 1992; Parvez, 2013) has been expressed using baculovirus expression system and purified in native condition. These constructs having significant variation, could result in difference as mentioned by Paliwal et al. (2014) and our study. With the present data it cannot be interpreted the nature of protein with dual properties of papain like Cysteine protease or Chymotrypsin like properties. Further studies will be required to validate this fact. In the present study, recombinant HEV protease was expressed using the baculovirus expression system since it is considered to be an efficient insect expression system with the ability to carry post-translational modifications (Chambers et al., 2018). Previously it has been reported that baculovirus system can express toxic proteins and proteases of different organisms (Keyvani-Amineh et al., 1995; Sali et al., 1998). The cell free assay was developed to quantify the activity of HEV protease since no robust protocols for protease digestion have been described so far. For development of cell free assays, three different approaches have been used to measure protease activity i.e., gelatin zymography, FTC-casein based assay and digestion of full lengthORF1 polyprotein. In pevious report gelatin zymography based assays has been used for hepatitis E viruses (Paliwal et al., 2014), whereby a clearing zone on the slide due to digestion of gelatin was formed. Similar to that, a clear zone was observed on zymogram when the native HEV protease was used. To determine the conditions for the optimal activity of the protease, it has been reported that cysteine protease activates at lower pH (Sundararaj et al., 2012). In our study the protease activity has been shown at lower pH which is typical of a cysteine protease. Digestion of gelatin in zymography gave the first direct evidence of protease activity by the expressed putative protease domain (432\u2013592 aa) of pORF1 leading us to express pORF1 in bacteria to be used as the substrate. The natural activity of HEV-protease could be studied by proteolysis of ORF1 polyprotein which was expressed via E. coli. Bl21-DE3 cells. HEV-protease cleaves ORF1 polyprotein in a time dependent manner. After 1 h of incubation, bands of ~100 and ~84 kDa were seen, which further cleaved into smaller products with time and after 5 h, multiple band of smaller size were seen due to proteolysis of ORF1. Digestion of ORF1 by cysteine protease resulted in ~84 kDa RdRp-Hel, and ~67 kDa Met-PCP fragments which were further processed into ~55 kDa RdRp, ~35 kDa Met, and ~27 kDa Hel fragments with higher incubation time. The above obtained fragments were similar in molecular mass to the ones observed in previous immunoprecipitation studies with replicon transfected HepG2 cells (Panda et al., 2000) and after expression of ORF1 polyprotein in cell free system as well as in mammalian cells (Ropp et al., 2000). In addition, ~55 kDa intermediately processed form of the RdRp and~35 kDa Met protein has also been seen in previous study after digestion of 84 kDa RdRp-Hel and 67 kDa Met-PCP fragments by immunoprecipitation (Paliwal et al., 2014). Similar size of products also has been seen in self-digestion of baculovirus derived ORF1 polyprotein (Sehgal et al., 2006). These results suggest role of HEV-protease in ORF1 polyprotein processing and HEV life cycle.",

            "text": "For the first time, enzyme kinetics of native active HEV protease has been determined in this study using FTC-casein substrate based assay to validate enzymatic activity and kinetics of HEV-protease. The values of Km and Vmax were found to be 0.054 mM and 0.77 mM/h, respectively. The optimal temperature for protease activity was found to be 37\u201348\u00b0C which corresponds well to the appropriate environments for HEV growth in the cells (Emerson et al., 2005; Tanaka et al., 2007; Johne et al., 2016). Activity of HEV protease was found to be pH dependent. The protease activity was found to be optimal at low pH of 4 which is the crucial factor to activate Papain like cysteine proteases (Richau et al., 2012; Sundararaj et al., 2012). A number of reports have shown that cysteine proteases can be auto catalytically activated in vitro from zymogen to mature enzyme even at reduced pH (Lowther et al., 2009; Sundararaj et al., 2012; Verma et al., 2016) indicating it to be a cysteine protease. In an attempt to validate the nature of the protease we used various inhibitors to monitor its activity. Twelve inhibitors were used to study the inhibition and it was found that the enzyme was completely resistant to the inhibitors of serine proteases (PMSF, AEBSF, aprotinin), aspartic proteases (pepstatin) and metalloproteases (EDTA) while it was moderately inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin, chymostatin and E-64. HEV protease was strongly inhibited by E-64 (99%) and chymostatin (98%), which had been reported to inhibit papain like cysteine protease (Saha et al., 2018). To confirm these results, modeled HEV protease structure has been docked with above inhibitors which shows that cysteine protease inhibitors E64, Chymostatin, Leupeptin, and ALLN have good docking score and strong binding affinity whereas remaining inhibitors PMSF, Phosparamidon, AEBSF, Bestatin and Pepstatin showed no or weak interactions and EDTA and Antipain remain undocked. Correlation coefficient was found 0.75 which showed good agreement between in vitro and in silico studies, suggesting strongly that the HEV-protease is a Papain like cysteine protease. Besides, in silico modeled structure of HEV-protease was found to be similar with Papain like cysteine proteases as it has structurally similar N-terminal helix domain and C-terminal \u03b2-sheet domain and conserved Cys\u2013His\u2013Asn triad at the active site (Koonin et al., 1992; Coulombe et al., 1996). Cys483 and His590 form a catalytic triad with Asn 591 which is present in active site between N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal \u03b2-sheet domain of HEV-protease. A histidine residue, presents in the active site act as proton donor and increase the nucleophilicity of the cysteine residue. Nucleophilic cysteine, act up on the carbon of the reactive peptide bond, release of an amine or amino terminus fragment of the substrate and producing the first tetrahedral thioester intermediate (Coulombe et al., 1996). This intermediate is now stabilized by hydrogen bonding between highly conserved glutamine residue and substrate oxyanion. Subsequently, thioester bond is hydrolyzed and form a carboxylic acid moiety from the remaining substrate fragment (Verma et al., 2016). Earlier, the Papain like proteases are characterized by the presence of two domains, an \u03b1- helix and a \u03b2-sheet domain forming a deep cleft which contains Cys-His-Asn residues along with Gln acting as a substrate-binding site (Turk et al., 2001). Similar observation has been recorded in our predicted 3D model showing two domain architecture structures where the Cys-His-and Asn triad is formed along with Gln at the active site. Further, according to our findings, the Cys483 and His590 forms a catalytic triad with Asn 591 present in active site between N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal \u03b2-sheet domain of HEV-protease. Further, our findings are also in agreement with previous study where HEV-protease has been categorized as a Papain like cysteine protease (Koonin et al., 1992; Parvez and Khan, 2014). In this study HEV protease was found to have these characteristics and on the basis of structural similarity with papain like protease it has been characterized as papain like cysteine protease. These findings are in the agreement of previous study where HEV-protease has been categorized as a Papain like cysteine protease (Koonin et al., 1992; Parvez and Khan, 2014).",

Out of these divalent cations Zn2+ remarkably decreased protease activity. Divalent cations like zinc and its conjugates have been identified as protease inhibitors for SARS-CoV proteases (Hsu et al., 2004), also zinc have been found to be essential for Structural stability, folding of NS3 protease of HCV (Urbani et al., 1998) and catalytic activity of Rubella protease (Liu et al., 1998). In another report, Zn has been found to be an essential structural cofactor for human corona virus papain like protease (Herold et al., 1999). Thus, we were interested in testing the influence of metal conjugated compound on HEV protease activity. Further, in silico studies have been performed to determine the zinc binding sites present in HEV protease. Two zinc binding sites have been identified, as \u201cZn2+ binding motif\u201d Cys457-His458-Cys459 (CHC) and Cys481-Thr482-Cys483 (CTC) and these findings are in agreement with previous report (Parvez and Khan, 2014) who studied that mutation in Cys 481 and Cys 483 leads to loss of protease activity (Parvez, 2013; Paliwal et al., 2014). These residues present in the zinc binding site may play role in its structural stability and proper folding. It was reported that zinc binding site mediates proteolytic activity of Corona viral papain like protease (Berg and Shi, 1996). These findings support our report where the loss of protease activity has been found in the presence of zinc, which may act as a cofactor and confer the structural stability.",

Chymotrypsin like proteases have been found to exhibited with three different catalytic triads Ser-His-Asp, Cys-His-Asp, and Cys- His-Glu (Bazan and Fletterick, 1988; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Matthews et al., 1994), whereas papain like proteases are found to have the conserved Cys-His dyad which are assisted by unique Asn and Asp residues (Gorbalenya et al., 1991). In both the chymotrypsin-like or papain-like proteases, Zn2+ is located at the site opposite to the active center (Herold et al., 1999). Therefore, the classification of HEV protease not only depends on the involvement of cysteine and histidine but also on structure and sequence homology. Papain like cysteine proteases are very stable enzymes and often are found in proteolytically harsh environments (Richau et al., 2012). Besides catalytic dyad/triad prediction we find that HEV-protease activity was found to be optimal at low pH of 4 which is the crucial factor to activate cysteine proteases. It is already reported that cysteine protease activates at lower pH (Sundararaj et al., 2012). In our study the protease activity has been shown at lower pH which is typical of a cysteine protease. On the basis of structural homology, active site residue and class specific inhibition we have classified HEV-protease as a \u201cPapain-like cysteine protease.\u201d",
