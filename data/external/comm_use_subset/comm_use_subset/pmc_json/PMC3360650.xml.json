            "text": "The viral hemaglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein of influenza A viruses is not only responsible for binding to cell receptor but also a primary target of neutralizing antibodies. It is initially synthesized as a precursor polypeptide (HA0) and subsequently cleaved by cellular proteases into disulfide-linked HA1 and HA2 subunits. The N-terminal HA1 subunit forms a globular head region that contains the receptor-binding site (RBS), whereas the membrane anchoring HA2 subunit forms a helix-rich stem that contains a relatively conserved fusion peptide. The HA protein of influenza A viruses evolves with great genetic diversity and can be classified into 16 distinct subtypes. However, few of the 16 subtypes have been finely characterized with respect to their antigenic structures. In the early 1980s, the location and structure of HA epitopes was first characterized in the three-dimensional (3D) model of the H3 subtype [1]. Four antigenic sites were demonstrated (A, B, C, and D), and a fifth (E) was later described. The H3 structure was used to map the antigenic sites of H1 [2], H2 [3], and H5 [4] subtypes. The H5 HA was antigenically mapped in greater detail after its crystal structure was reported [5]\u2013[7]. Prominently, the antibody binding epitopes of the H5 HA are located exclusively in areas corresponding to antigenic sites A and B of H3 HA and the antigenic site Sa of H1 HA. Recently, Kaverin et al\n[8] demonstrated that the HA antigenic structure of recent HPAI H5N1 isolates differs substantially from that of low-pathogenicity H5 strains described earlier and is rapidly evolving.",

            "text": "It is also noteworthy that previous epitope mapping of HA protein were largely based on the virus escape mutants selected by mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which might not precisely predict the antigenic epitopes recognized by human immune system [9]. The apparent success of passive immunotherapy of a H5N1-infected patient with convalescent plasma emphasizes the importance of human antibodies in fighting against influenza [10]\u2013[11], and also sparks the development of neutralizing human mAbs as antiviral agents by various approaches. Importantly, human mAbs can also be used to map the antigenic epitopes of HA that stimulate humoral immune responses during the natural infection of influenza viruses and thus serve as an ideal basis for vaccine development. Recently, Sun et al generated two H5N1-neutralizing human mAbs, AVFluIgG01 and AVFluIgG03, by screening a phage display library derived from a recovered patient infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses [12]. Previous studies showed that AVFluIgG01 had a broad-spectrum anti-H5N1 activity and its passive immunization could efficiently protect mice from a lethal H5N1 virus infection [12]. In this study, we have focused to characterize its antigenic epitope and neutralization mechanism. Our data have demonstrated that AVFluIgG01 targets a novel and conserved conformation-dependent epitope located in the globular head region of HA and exerts its neutralizing activity by simultaneously blocking viral attachment to the cell receptors and interfering with HA conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion.",

To better locate its epitope residues, we synthesized a set of overlapping peptides that cover full length HA and used in peptide-based ELISA (Fig. 1). Disappointedly, AVFluIgG01 did not react with the peptide 110\u2013127 that contains the 116IIPKSSWSS124 sequence and any of other overlapping and non-overlapping peptides, while it reacted strongly with recombinant HA and HA1 proteins (Fig. 1A\u20131B). This result implied that the epitope for AVFluIgG01 could not be simply located within the 116IIPKSSWSS124 motif. Therefore, we tested the reactivity of AVFluIgG01 with a DTT-reduced HA in comparison with the native HA. Fig. 1C shows that disulfide bond reduction of HA protein could completely abolish the binding of AVFluIgG01. Serving as a control antibody recognizing a conformation-dependent epitope, AVFluIgG03 reacted with the native but not reduced HA similarly. Severing as a control antibody recognizing a linear epitope within HA2, 9G1G9 reacted with both native and reduced HA proteins. These results indicated that AVFluIgG01 was directed against a disulfide bond-dependent conformational epitope expressed on the HA1 subunit.",

            "text": "We sought to decipher the binding sites of AVFluIgG01 by selecting mimotopes from a random peptide phage display library, as previously used to map conformation-dependent mAbs [13]\u2013[14]. After 3 rounds of panning, 53 phage clones were isolated and the amino acid sequences of their peptides were determined (Fig. 2A). The specificity and relative affinity of the binding of these peptides to AVFluIgG01 were tested in ELISA as described. From total of selected 23 different mimotopes, we could not find apparent consensus sequences or common sequence motifs that can deduce epitopic HA residues. Therefore, we used two computational methods, Mapitope and Pep-3D-Search, to predict the AVFluIgG01 epitope. Both searching algorithms are preferentially for identifying discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on the 3D structure of a protein antigen [15]\u2013[16]. As shown in Fig. 2B\u20132C, the Mapitope predicted a total 32 residues while the Pep-3D-Search predicted 36 residues. All predicted residues are exclusively located in the global head region of HA1 subunit. Notably, two patches of residues (S121, W122, S123, S124, H125 and Y164, N165, T167, N168, Q169) were predicted by both programs, suggesting an involvement of these two sites for AVFluIgG01 binding.",

The reactivity of AVFluIgG01 with each HA mutant was examined by IFA and FACS assays. The results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3. As a control for expression, no mutations affected the binding ability of a human mAb directed against the HA2 subunit. Prominently, substitutions of W122 and T167 with alanine completely abolished the binding of AVFluIgG01 to the HA expressed on the cell surface, while substitutions of the residues I116, I117, P118, S123, and Y164 resulted in a dramatic loss of the reactivity. This result verified these residues as critical sites for AVFluIgG01 binding.

First, the HA protein binds to the cell receptor resulting in the endocytosis of virus into the host. Second, the viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral RNA into the host cell. To explore the mechanism of neutralization by AVFluIgG01, we first performed experiments to know whether this mAb can inhibit the receptor-binding step. As shown in Fig. 5A, the virus binding inhibition assay indicated that AVFluIgG01 could efficiently inhibit HA-mediated virus binding to the MDCK cells. Apparently, this inhibition was at a dose-dependent manner (high, medium, and low). Fig. 5B shows an inhibition curve with IC50 at 1.85 \u00b5g/ml. However, the Fab fragment of AVFluIgG01 had no such inhibitory activity. As expected, two control mAbs, AVFluIgG03 and CR6261 could not inhibit the virus-receptor binding. It is known that AVFluIgG03 has no reactivity with the tested HA (A/H5N1/Vietnam/04) and CR6261 targets a conserved epitope in the HA2 subunit [12], [19].",

Convincingly, the low-pH treated HA could be completely digested by trypsin in the absence of AVFluIgG01 or its Fab fragment (lane 5 in Fig. 8A and 8B). However, both formats of antibodies were able to protect the HA from the degradation by protease (lane 7 in Fig. 8A and 8B).

The in vivo protection of AVFluIgG01 against challenge by H5N1 virus highlights its potential application as a therapeutic antibody or as a basis for vaccine development. In both cases, characterizations of its antigenic epitope and mechanism of neutralization is a key step. In the present study, we have first demonstrated that the epitope of AVFluIgG01 is a conformation-dependent and consists of three discontinuous sites. The site I comprises three amino acids residues (I116, I117, P118), while both of site II (W122, S123) and site III (Y164, T167) comprise two amino acids. In the 3D structure of H5N1 HA, these epitope residues are closely located at the tip of the membrane-distal globular head of HA and neighbored with the receptor-binding domain, which comprises the 190-helix (HA1 188 to 190), 130-loop (HA1 134 to 138) and 220-loop (HA1 221 to 228) as colored in red in Fig. 4B. Interestingly, although this region is highly variable but all the epitope participatory residues are highly conserved among diverse H5 clades and subclades. We believe that this conservation could provide the basis for antibody to exert its broad-spectrum anti-H5N1 activity.",

            "text": "Obviously, our present results differ from the previous data reported by Sun et al\n[12]. The authors considered that the AVFluIgG01 was directed against a linear epitope based on its reactivity in the Western-blotting assay. The epitope was further located within the amino acid sequence of 116IIPKSSWSS124 based on the mutagenesis analysis. In our Western blotting assays using both recombinant proteins and transfected cells as samples, AVFluIgG01 did repeatedly react with the HA protein in the gels (data not shown). In general view, the simplest way to determine whether an epitope is conformational or linear is by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE [20]. If the antibody still binds after the protein has been denatured, the epitope is unlikely to be highly conformational. However, protein renaturation can occur after SDS gel electrophoresis or after electroblotting, which may result in an epitope refolded. In particular, a positive reaction on immunoblots can also be achieved by non-linear epitopes where the reacting portions are in relatively close proximity. In our experiences, a panel of mouse mAbs against the spike protein of SARS-CoV reacted with antigens on immunoblots but their epitopes were conformation-dependent [21]\u2013[23]. Therefore, the AVFluIgG01 epitope might be such the case. The steric residues in the three sites could be readily refolded through short-range interactions to keep a \u201clocal\u201d conformation. But the epitope could not be refolded when the HA protein was treated by a reducing reagent followed by blocking the reactive sites, thus resulting in the loss of the reactivity in ELISA wells. Contradicting to the previous conclusion, AVFluIgG01 could not recognize any of the synthesized peptides that contain or overlap the proposed linear epitope sequence (116IIPKSSWSS124). Taken together, the data strongly suggested a conformation-dependent epitope for AVFluIgG01. Therefore, we decided to map its contacting residues on the surface of the HA tridimensional structure by using a random peptide phage display library in combination with the computational prediction and experimental verification.",

            "text": "Vaccination is considered to be the most efficient strategy to combat the influenza A virus, but its continous antigenic drift and occasional antigenic shift have significantly hampered the development of an universal influenza vaccine [24]\u2013[25]. For many years, considerable efforts have been made to characterize the antigenic epitopes of the HA protein, but much of the available information pertains to antibodies generated from mice rather than humans [9], [26]. The frequent occurrence of highly pathogenic H5N1-infected human cases and the recent outbreak of a novel swine-like human H1N1 influenza virus have promoted the exploration of natural-occurring human antibodies as therapeutics or for vaccine design. In recent years, a number of human mAbs to H5N1 viruses have been generated from either immortalized human memory B cells obtained from patients who recovered from H5N1 disease or with combinational antibody library technologies [12], [17], [27]\u2013[31]. It has been shown that some of these human antibodies possess broad-spectrum H5N1-neutralizing activity or cross-subtype reactivity to H1 viruses, and are highly effective in suppressing H5N1 virus in experimentally infected animals when administered prophylactically or therapeutically [12], [25], [28], [31]. Importantly, antigenic characterizations of the newly-isolated anti-H5N1 human mAbs have identified novel neutralizing epitopes in HA protein and provided intriguing insights for universal influenza vaccine development [12]\u2013[13], [17], [19], [25], [28]. The best examples are human mAbs CR6261 and F10, which possess broadly neutralizing activity and are directed against the highly conserved epitopes in the HA2 subunit [19], [25], [28], [31]. It is also impressive that the epitope of AVFluIgG01 is overlapped by two other epitopes recognized by human mAbs (FLA5.10 and FLD21.140) that were isolated from the survivals of HPAI H5N1 in Vietnam [27]. FLA5.10 recognized a conformational epitope containing the residues 115QIIP118 and 126EASL129 and had a narrow (clade 1-specific) neutralization range, while FLD21.140 recognized a conformational epitope containing the residues 121SWS123 and 164YNNT167and had a relatively broader cross-clade neutralization than the former [13], [27]. During the preparation of this manuscript, a new anti-H5N1 human mAb, 65C6 with the neutralizing and protective activity has been reported by Hu et al\n[17]. It was isolated from a surviving patient from H5N1 infection in China, and mapped to a conformational epitope containing the residues P118, S121, K161, Y164 and T167 [17]. Given that these neutralizing human mAbs were isolated from different surviving H5N1-infected patients in independent laboratories but reacted with the overlapping epitopes that are closely located a similar region on the surface of HA 3D structure, we believe that the AVFluIgG01 epitope represents an immunodominant site during natural infection and can be used for immunogen design to elicit broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses.",

Actually, both aspects are important for dissecting the structure and function of the HA protein and thus for developing immunotherapeutics and vaccines against influenza. In this study, we first demonstrated that AVFluIgG01 could block both HA-mediated virus attachment and postattachment steps, and then showed its direct inhibition on HA-mediated cell-cell fusion and acquisition of pH-induced protease sensitivity. The data suggest that AVFluIgG01 neutralizes the virus through inhibiting not only receptor-binding but also membrane fusion. In other word, both neutralization mechanisms can occur simultaneously. This may not be so surprising to know that this HA1-specific mAb can block two key steps for vial entry and infection. The previous studies demonstrated that some HA1-specific mouse mAbs against H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) behaved similarly, although their specificity was concentration-dependent event [32]\u2013[33]. Interestingly, a recent study reported that HA1-specific mouse anti-H5N1 mAb 9F4 was not able to block the interaction between HA and its receptor but did block the virus entry at the postattachment step. Consistently, 9F4 was further shown to prevent the pH-mediated conformational change of HA. Indeed, the neutralization of influenza viruses is highly complex and multifaceted, and is governed by factors that include the virus strain, the antigenic epitope, the antibody affinity and concentration, and the cells used [32].",

In a sharp contrast, it could efficiently block the membrane fusion step, as evidenced by its potent inhibition on the viral entry after cell attachment (Fig. 6) and on the HA acquisition of pH-induced protease sensitivity (Fig. 8). Previous studies established that some HA1-specific Fabs neutralize H1N1 viruses by inhibiting fusion activity only, differing from their IgGs [33]\u2013[34]. On the other hand, some HA1-specific Fabs neutralize by inhibiting virus attachment only, but mechanism of neutralization by their IgGs is complex and occurs simultaneously through fusion inhibition and attachment inhibition [32]. Compared to HA1-specific mAbs, HA2-specific mAbs, such as CR6261, neutralize the virus by a mechanism of inhibiting membrane fusion activity exclusively [19], [28], [35]\u2013[36].",
