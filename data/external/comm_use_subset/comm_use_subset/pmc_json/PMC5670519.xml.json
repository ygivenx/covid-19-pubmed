            "text": "Duck virus hepatitis (DVH), which was first described in Long Island in 1949 [1], is commonly recognized as an acute and fatal disease of ducklings. DVH is caused by duck hepatitis virus (DHV) types 1, 2 and 3, and no antigenic relationships have been found among them [2\u20135]. In the three different serotypes of DHVs, DHV-1 was considered as the most common and most virulent serotype [1, 6]. According to the Virus Taxonomy the Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), DHV-1 was classified as a member of Picornaviridae and renamed as duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) [7]. As the only member of the genus Avihepatovirus in the family Picornaviridae, DHAV has been further classified into three serotypes: the DHAV serotype 1 (DHAV-1, the classical serotype) [8, 9], the DHAV serotype 2 (DHAV-2, a serotype isolated in Taiwan) [10], and the DHAV serotype 3 (DHAV-3, a serotype isolated in South Korea and China) [11, 12]. There is no cross-neutralization between DHAV-1 and DHAV-2 [10] yet limited cross-neutralization between DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 [13]. Both DHV-2 and DHV-3 were later identified as astroviruses based on sequence analysis of a 391 nt RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [14].",

            "text": "Reverse genetics systems have been considered as powerful tools for studying all aspects of virus biology, including virus pathogenesis and vaccine development [17]. Up to date, there are at least four types of viral RNA rescued system, including RNA-launched system [18], helper virus-launched system [19] and two DNA-launched systems based on cellular RNA polymerases I and II [20\u201322]. Although the infectious DHAV genomic RNA could be harvested in vitro from a full-length DHAV cDNA clone by the RNA-launched reverse genetics system [23, 24], the operative strategy still depends on in vitro transcription. Compared to the RNA-launched infectious clone, the RNA polymerases II-based DNA-launched infectious system is able to generate homogenous RNA transcripts from transfected cDNA clone in vivo, allowing for higher rescue efficiency with less cost and labor by skipping in vitro RNA transcription [25\u201327]. For porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), by the introduction of ribozyme elements at both termini of the viral genomic cDNA, an improved DNA-launched infectious clone improved the rescue efficacy with approximately 10\u201350-fold higher than the in vitro-transcribed RNA-based system [28]. The hammerhead ribozyme is a catalytic motif responsible for the self-cleaving activity of RNA virusoids [29], while the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme also contains site-specific self-cleavage with the existence of divalent cations and a cytidine nucleotide [30]. After transcription, the ribozymes at both termini of DNA-launched infectious clones could lead into the self-cutting and releasing of the viral mRNA under the condition of existing Mg2+ or other divalent ions and a cytidine nucleotide. By this way, the viral RNA can be harvested by direct transfection with the recombinant plasmid without in vitro transcription [31].",

The mortality of duck flock was 80%, and the sick ducklings died quickly with typical hemorrhagic hepatitis. After propagated in the allantonic cavities of 10-day-old duck embryos and adapted to BHK-21 cells for five passages, the LY0801 strain was used for the full-length genomic cDNA construction. Anti-DHAV-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4F8, which could recognize the epitope \u201c75GEIILT80\u201d in VP1 of DHAV-1, was stored in the veterinary molecular etiology laboratory of Shandong Agricultural University [32]. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was purchased from KPL (MD, USA), Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Abcam (MA, USA).",

These mutations caused no change of the amino acids (Table 2). Comparing with the 5th passage of LY0801 strain, there was no base change in pIR-DHAV-1 or rDHAV-1 except for the mutation (from T to C) at 3042 position.\n",

Although the previous research has reported about the establishment of the RNA-launched infectious clone of DHAV-1 [23] and DHAV-3 [24], the in vitro transcription will raise the operation difficulty and experiment cost. The DNA-launched infectious system possessed self-cleaving ribozyme elements at both termini of the viral genomic cDNA, which was expected to retain the authentic terminal nucleotide sequences of the viral genome [28]. The 3\u2032 product of the HDV ribozyme was shown to serve as the substrate for polyadenylation [34]. Here, we established an improved DNA-launched infectious system based on the DHAV-1 LY0801 strain. The viral genome of DHAV-1 was placed under the control of a CMV promoter, allowing the conventional plasmid DNA transfection and generation of homogenous RNA transcripts in vivo by the cellular RNA polymerase II, which could reduce labor and experimental cost. Compared to the RNA-launched infectious system, the DNA-launched infectious system of DHAV-1 improved the viral rescue efficiency approximately 10 to 20 folds (Fig. 6).",

Meanwhile, a similar pattern also occurred in the survival curves of the ducklings inoculated with the rDHAV-1 or pDHAV-1 (Fig. 7A). In order to distinguish the rescued virus from parental virus, the genetic marker was engineered into pIR-DHAV-1. The virus copy number peaked at 48 and 60 hpi in supernatants and BHK-21 cells, respectively. The virus copy number was subsequently followed by a decline, which was consistent with the observation of parental group. Western blot results also confirmed the similar growth characteristics between the rescued virus and parental virus (Fig. 5). The survival curve comparison between the rDHAV-1 and pDHAV-1 also showed almost identical infectivity characteristics. To sum up, the rescued recombinant virus was capable of infecting susceptible host cells and exhibited almost identical replication and infectivity efficiency as 5th passage of LY0801 strain. Based on that, we then investigated viral replication features of rDHAV-1 in young ducklings. In the previous study, the viral RNA could be detected in all the different tissues (heart, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus and BF) of the duckling inoculated with the rDHAV-1, which was consistent with the naturally infected ducks by DHAV-1 [33]. In our experiment, the viral RNA of rDHAV-1 was firstly detected in liver with viral load of 103.0 \u00b1 0.0 copies/g at 1 hpi, whereas the rDHAV-1 was detected in the other five tissues at 2 hpi or 6 hpi (Table 2), which showed that liver might be the most sensitive tissue during the early infection of DHAV-1 via subcutaneously. With an exception of thymus at 6 hpi, the liver tissue exhibited the highest viral load in the six selected tissues from 1hpi to 48 hpi, which could partly explain the severe liver damage induced by the infection of DHAV-1.",

The DNA-launched reverse genetics system allows the rapid introduction of mutations into the viral genome, which will greatly facilitate the study of the structural and functional relationship of DHAV-1 genes, as well as the development of DHAV-1 vaccine based on the genetically engineered and attenuated mutant clones.",

The LY0801 virus genome with two ribozyme sequences introduced at the both ends was placed downstream of the CMV promoter in pIR vector to construct the DNA-launched infectious clone, pIR-DHAV-1. A total of 4 overlapping fragments amplified from total RNAs extracted from the 5th passage of LY0801 virus were assembled successively into the pIR vector by unique restriction enzyme indicated for each fragment. A copy of hammerhead ribozyme sequence and Asc I restrict enzyme site were engineered at the 5\u2032 end while a copy of hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDVRs) sequence and Xho I restrict enzyme site were engineered at the 3\u2032 end of the cDNA copy of DHAV full-length genome, respectively.
