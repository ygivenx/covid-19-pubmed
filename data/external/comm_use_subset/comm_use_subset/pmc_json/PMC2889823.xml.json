In Western Europe, rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals was a well-known illness that has now become a rare disease, because many countries have succeeded in eradicating it. The major risk of rabies is now due to translocation of infected animals, mainly dogs, from rabies-enzootic areas and humans with rabies infection acquired abroad [8]. Although untreated rabies is invariably fatal, death can be avoided by proper administration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP), e.g., antirabies vaccine, with or without antirabies immunoglobulins (ARIG), before disease onset [6]. Thus, rapid identification of individuals potentially exposed to rabies is critical and media alerts can be extremely useful to identify people who were in contact with the rabid animal.",

RPEP is administered, predominantly according to the Zagreb schedule, to people bitten by an animal suspected of being infected with rabies or exposed to its saliva. Clinicians conduct a risk assessment for each exposed patient, and decide to administer RPEP according to the general recommendations, epidemiological data and grade of the bite [9]. The French network for rabies prophylaxis provides exhaustive national data collected by ARMC [10], and laboratory diagnoses of humans suspected of having rabies [11] and animals suspected contaminating humans. From 1968 to 1998, a period during which rabies was endemic in French foxes, more than 45,600 animals were diagnosed as rabid. In 2001, France was declared free of rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals based on World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) criteria and, as a consequence, the number of RPEP began to decline progressively.",

In 2001, France was declared free of rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals based on OIE criteria [19] and, as a consequence, the number of patients consulting ARMC and receiving RPEP began to decline progressively to respective minima of 7,788 and 3,378 in 2003 (Figure 3).

In such a case, Box and Jenkins recommend using at least two seasonality periods to calibrate the model [14].

Consequently, use of public health facilities dedicated to the disease decreased steadily from 1990 until 2003, suggesting a continuous impact of rabies elimination on related public health resources and expenses. However, the very mild decline of the 2000\u20132003 slope probably reflects the difficulties in convincing the public and adapting medical practice to the changing risk. Although elimination of rabies in foxes reduced the number of rabid pets and other domestic animals, and thus exposure to rabies, pet bites continue. Importation of rabid animals and infected travelers returning from abroad also regularly challenge the French public health organization of rabies control. Therefore, the number of RPEP prescriptions and the associated costs will not decline significantly until there is adequate assurance that the probability of a pet being rabid is sufficiently low that such therapy is not warranted, even when the pet's status cannot be verified [22], [23], [24]. Regardless of potential French specificities, public health decision-makers are obliged to consider such potential events and their ensuing demand on medical community resources when attempting to predict and maintain the efficacy of rabies-control policies even in rabies-free countries [24]\u2013[28].",

Third, additional public concern might also have been heightened by controversies surrounding the crisis management. Notably, event #6 occurred just before the annual opening of hunting season, in a strongly traditional hunting region. An initial decision was made to forbid hunting with dogs in the counties where the rabid dog had traveled during his infectious period. That restriction led to a passionate public debate, angering hunters and ending with hunting organizations successfully blocking the ban.

Furthermore, public health crises, e.g. that generated by severe acute respiratory syndrome, demonstrated how conflicting messages can create confusion and uncertainty in both the media and the general public [21]. However, this event #6 newspaper coverage, initiated and promoted by public health authorities, reached its primary and immediate objective, e.g., no secondary dog or human rabies case was reported following the dog's arrival in France. Eight of the 13 identified individuals, who had been exposed to the rabid dog, were located and contacted and 49 dogs and 8 cats identified as having been in direct contact with the event #6 dog were killed. We would have expected this unusual news coverage of a rabies event to have raised public awareness about the risks of illegally importing animals from endemic countries. Between 2000 and 2005, France was the only rabies-free European country to have so many imported cases. Unfortunately, in 2007\u20132008, two new dog-importation episodes were reported in France, clearly illustrating the short persistence of this type of information disseminated to the public. Because of one of these events, France lost its rabies-free status according to OIE criteria in 2008.",

In response to national newspaper coverage, people who are far from the event location can become concerned and start taking precautions as if they were in the affected area [3], [4], [32]. This phenomenon is particularly well illustrated by event #6, for which exposure dates reported by patients consulting at AMRC in areas 1 and 2 corresponded to the period of newspaper coverage rather than to the risk-of-transmission period during the dog's movements.",

This crisis highlighted a lack of experienced manpower and insufficient vaccine stocks. Outbreaks of emerging and/or deadly infections, like severe acute respiratory syndrome [34]\u2013[38], anthrax [39], [40] and rabies (herein), have shown that media messages dramatically influence both the public's and health-care workers' perceptions of the risk with potential implications for health-care resources. Our observations underscore to what extent, under such circumstances, public health decision-makers have to anticipate the depth and scope of potential consequences of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases and their related press communications, and the need to prepare appropriate responses to keep the public health organization effective. It also illustrated that, despite communication efforts implemented by the French public health authorities and messages released through the ARMC network, long-term modifications of ARMC activities and prescriptions were observed, further emphasizing that a post-crisis communication strategy is essential.",
