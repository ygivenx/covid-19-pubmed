Most probably this epidemic was caused by a spill-over of a low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI) originating from wild aquatic birds, since this Seal/H10N7 is genetically closely related to various influenza viruses detected in wild birds [3, 5].",

            "text": "Spill-over events of influenza A viruses from wild water-birds to seals have been reported on different occasions as reviewed by White [6]. In 2011 there was an outbreak of fatal H3N8 influenza virus infection in harbor seals on the coast of New England, United States. This H3N8 virus is most likely of avian origin and the results of some studies suggest adaption to humans by increased binding affinity for the human-type \u03b12,6-sialic acid receptors [7, 8], while others do not [9]. In seals this virus caused interstitial pneumonia, hemorrhagic alveolitis and necrotizing bronchitis. Virus antigen and RNA was found in bronchiolar epithelium by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ-hybridization (ISH) [7, 10]. Ferrets infected with this H3N8 virus demonstrated virus titers of above 106 TCID50/g in the nasal turbinates and the lungs [11]. The few pathological investigations on seals that died during this Seal/H10N7 outbreak report similar lesions, consisting of necro-suppurative bronchopneumonia with a bacterial co-infection [1, 2]. The whole spectrum of virus-associated histological changes, the distribution of viral antigen and the target cell tropism of Seal/H10N7 in harbor seals are unknown. This study provides a more comprehensive description of histological, IHC, virological, bacteriological and parasitological findings in 16 naturally infected seals that were described previously by Bodewes and co-workers [3, 5]. Since the zoonotic potential of Seal/H10N7 is unknown, especially people handling ill seals, performing necropsies, or disposing carcasses may be at risk. A good and well accepted animal model for severe respiratory disease caused by influenza A viruses in humans is the ferret after intratracheal inoculation. Therefore, to predict the cell tropism and lesions solely caused by Seal/H10N7 in seals (and humans) without bacterial co-infection, six ferrets were intratracheally inoculated with Seal/H10N7, euthanized on 3 or 7 days post infection, necropsied and sampled for pathology, IHC and virology.",

Except one juvenile individual that had been euthanized, all other seals had died spontaneously. After retrieval from the coast the carcasses were kept at +4\u00b0C or were deep frozen (-80\u00b0C) until necropsy (Table 1). A short report about the findings and molecular identification of the virus has been published previously [3, 5]. A complete necropsy was performed on each seal. Numerous organ and tissue samples were collected including skin, skeletal muscle, tongue, mandibular, retropharyngeal, pulmonary and mesenteric lymph nodes, tonsils, bone marrow, thymus, nasal mucosa, trachea, lung, heart, aorta, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidneys, urinary bladder, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine, gonads, uterus, adrenal glands, thyroid glands, brain and spinal cord. The samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and processed routinely into paraffin wax.",

A monoclonal antibody (HB65) was used for immunolabelling of influenza A nucleoprotein [13]. For negative control purposes, the primary antibody was replaced by ascitic fluid from non-immunized Balb/cJ mice.",

Virus end-point titrations were performed as described previously [22]. Briefly, MDCK cells were inoculated with tenfold serial dilution of virus stocks, nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs and homogenized tissue samples. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) one hour after inoculation and cultured in infection medium, consisting of Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 mg/ml NaHC03, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1X non-essential amino acids (NEAA), and 20 \u03bcg/ml trypsin (Lonza). Three days after inoculation, supernatants of cell cultures were tested for agglutinating activity using turkey erythrocytes as an indicator of virus replication in the cells. Infectious virus titers were calculated in quadruplicates of each of the nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, and homogenized tissue samples and for ten-fold replicates of the virus stocks by the method of Reed and Munch [23].",

Seal/H10N7 caused respiratory disease in both naturally infected wild harbor seals and experimentally infected ferrets. In both species, virus-induced lesions and cell type tropism were restricted to the respiratory tract with no evidence for spread to extra-respiratory tissues. In the respiratory tract of seals virus antigen and inflammation were most prominent in bronchial and submucosal glandular epithelial cells whereas in ferrets they were mainly found in bronchiolar and bronchial submucosal glandular epithelial cells. This slight difference in the predominant tissue structure tropism may depend on the species difference, perhaps a species-specific difference in cell-receptor distribution.",

Our findings share morphological findings that have been described in seals infected with Seal/H10N7 from Sweden and Denmark, however, immunohistochemical staining for virus antigen has not been described [1, 2]. Lesions and cell type tropism of Seal/H10N7 infection in harbor seals is in accordance with previously described natural infections of harbor seals with LPAI H3N8 influenza virus in which virus and lesions were mainly present in the bronchi [7], and of harbor seals naturally infected with LPAI H7N7 that developed necrotizing bronchitis, bronchiolitis and hemorrhagic alveolitis [27]. The latter report mentioned concurrent infection with Mycoplasma sp. that has been shown in 25% of the investigated seals. However, Mycoplasma sp. was also detected in influenza negative seals (data not shown). Experimental infection with LPAI H7N7 demonstrated pneumonitis and virus isolation from the lung and bronchial lymph node without description of bronchitis [28].",

Similar lesions caused by bacterial or parasitic infections represent common causes of death particularly in young harbor seals from the North Sea [29]. However, primary influenza A virus infection has led to an increased mortality in the seal population during the epidemic. Concurrent infections with bacteria were also described in Sweden and Denmark since all animals had severe growth in the lungs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus or Escherichia coli [1, 2]. The presence of severe lesions due to bacterial co-infections was also seen in the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics in humans since antibiotics were not available at that time [30]. Also in previous reports on influenza outbreaks in seals, concurrent infections with different bacteria (among which Mycoplasma spp., Streptococcus spp., E. coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus, Clostridium spp. and C. perfringens, Neisseria spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Pasteurella spp., Aggregatibacter [formerly known as Actinobacillus] actinomycetemcomitans and Bordetella bronchiseptica) were described, e.g. with H7N7 [27] or H3N8 [7]. It is noteworthy that S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus and B. bronchiseptica were isolated only from lungs of seals that died during phocine distemper or influenza epidemics [31\u201333], which may be explained by the immunosuppressive effects of morbilli- and influenza virus infections. During regular health monitoring of dead seals found stranded on the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, independent of mass mortalities, these bacteria were not found (unpublished data). Apparently, Seal/H10N7 by itself is not so virulent, but may be lethal in combination with bacterial infection as was seen in human fatal cases of 1918 influenza virus infection [34]. The lungworm infection associated with the (pyo)granulomatous pneumonia was most likely pre-existent because of the chronicity of the lesions. Furthermore, Geraci et al. showed that the prevalence of lung- and heart-worm infections in seals naturally infected with H7N7 influenza virus was not different from seals stranded due to other causes [27].",

They were susceptible to infection and developed respiratory disease, which suggests that Seal/H10N7 is potentially virulent for human beings. Ferrets showed bronchopneumonia associated with intralesional virus antigen mainly located in bronchiolar epithelial cells and less frequently in type I and II pneumocytes, bronchial, bronchial glandular and tracheal epithelial cells. Also, virus was predominantly found in pharyngeal swabs, trachea, bronchus and lung but not in the extra-respiratory organs. In ferrets, the bronchiolar tropism of Seal/H10N7 was similar to that of influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 virus (H1N1 pandemic), and was associated with similar but less severe lesions; the tropism was different from HPAI H5N1, which is more present in the alveoli and accounts for more severe alveolitis than was seen in our ferrets [36]. This fits with the lower virulence seen in Seal/H10N7 infection when compared to H1N1 pandemic and HPAI H5N1 infections and suggests that Seal/H10N7 potentially may infect humans and cause a respiratory disease with similar, albeit less severe lesions compared to those seen in humans with H1N1 pandemic or HPAI H5N1 infections.",

However, similar changes were seen in the lower respiratory tract including tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchial adenitis and to a lesser extent bronchiolitis. During the influenza outbreak there were also seals with a similar pattern of lesion that were negative for influenza A virus by PCR and immunohistochemistry (data not shown) possibly indicating virus clearance. When comparing cell type tropism, in both seals and ferrets tracheal, bronchial and bronchial glandular epithelial cells were positive for virus antigen. Virus attachment studies with LPAI viruses (H7N7 and H4N5 mallard) showed moderate virus attachment to trachea and bronchi, moderate to scarce attachment to bronchioles and scarce attachment to alveoli of harbor seals [39], which is consistent with the tropism found by IHC in the harbor seals naturally infected with Seal/H10N7. In contrast, human influenza viruses showed no attachment to trachea and bronchi and only scarce attachment to bronchioles and alveoli of harbor seals [39]. LPAI H5N9 and H6N1 in ferrets, like HPAI H5N1, showed attachment only to alveoli [40], which could explain the alveolitis but may not reflect the situation for H10N7, which also was present in trachea, bronchi and bronchioles of ferrets in our study.",

In one ferret with influenza virus in the olfactory bulb, contamination during necropsy from the adjacent virus-positive nasal cavity cannot be excluded.",

Similar tropism for bronchial glands with subsequent lesions has been described for H1N1pandemic infection in ferrets and for seasonal human influenza virus H1N1 and H3N2 infections in humans [35]. Also, virus attachment studies demonstrated tropism of seasonal human influenza virus and avian LPAI and HPAI viruses for bronchial submucosal glands in humans [41] and of H1N1 pandemic and seasonal human influenza virus in ferrets [40]. Tropism for bronchial glandular epithelial cells may play a role in efficient mammal-to-mammal transmission, since virus excreted from these glands into the bronchus is more likely to be expectorated than virus produced in the alveolar epithelial cells.",

Additionally, intratracheally infected ferrets had moderate inflammation in the lower respiratory tract, indicating that humans may potentially be infected and develop disease when infected with Seal/H10N7. This mass outbreak of H10N7 in seals demonstrates the ease of a bird-to-seal infection of a low pathogenic avian influenza virus such as this Seal/H10N7 from wild birds and thus be a potential risk for humans. In case of a future outbreak in harbor seals caused by Seal/H10N7 or a related virus, its zoonotic potential needs to be evaluated and taken into account.",
