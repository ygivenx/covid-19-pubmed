The nucleotide sequence that forms any gene is translated into its corresponding amino acid sequence. This sequence of amino acids becomes functional only when it adopts its tertiary structure. Experimental methods such as X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance are considered authoritative ways for obtaining proteins' structure and function. These experimental methods are very expensive and time consuming. Therefore, computational methods for predicting protein structure have become very useful. Proteins with similar sequences are usually homologous, typically displaying similar 3D structure and function.",

Results of these programs provide an approximate solution to the protein alignment problem. On the other hand, many alignment-free approaches are proposed for sequence comparison. Most biological sequence analysis methods still have weaknesses, including having low precision and being time consuming [4, 5].",

Adjacency matrices are also introduced in some articles [18\u201321], where an exact solution is obtained to the protein alignment problem. Additional methods use discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in which DNA sequences are mapped into four binary indicator sequences, followed by the application of DFT on these indicator sequences to transform them into a frequency domain [22, 23]. Dynamic representation is used to remove degeneracies in the previously mentioned approaches [24\u201331]. Another method is based on the simplified pulse-coupled neural network (S-PCNN) and Huffman coding where the triplet code was used as a code bit to transform DNA sequence into numerical sequence [32].",

A new descriptor is introduced, comprising a vector composed of the mean and standard deviation of the total numbers of each protein sequence (A\u00aft, SAt). Our graphical representation eliminates degeneracy and has no loss of information. It is suitable for both short and long sequences. As a proof of concept, our approach is applied on nine beta globin protein sequences and nine ND5 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5) protein sequences. It can be applied on any sequence length with the same efficiency. Correlation and significance analyses are introduced among our results, along with PID% [15] and ClustalW [33] to demonstrate the utility of our approach.",

To measure the degree of similarity between human and chimpanzee, the Euclidean distance between these vectors is evaluated. The similarity/dissimilarity matrices of beta globin and ND5 protein sequences are illustrated in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.  Table 8 results show that human and chimpanzee sequences are similar. There is also striking similarity between mouse and rat sequences, while human and opossum sequences are obviously dissimilar.  Table 9 results show that pigmy chimpanzee, common chimpanzee, human, and gorilla ND5 protein sequences are similar, while the blue whale is similar to the fin whale, and mouse is similar to rat. Similar to the other sequence, human and opossum are still dissimilar. However, our algorithm cannot measure the degree of similarity very well for pigmy chimpanzee.

Each amino acid in a given protein sequence has its own intensity and intensity level. They are vectors of N elements as N is the protein sequence length. The combined intensity level is then computed and graphed to represent any protein sequence graphically. Our 2D graphical representation effectively displays differences between protein sequences without degeneracies. The graph does not overlap or intersect with itself. Our new descriptor suggested a vector of two elements, which are the mean and standard deviation of the combined intensity level (A\u00aft  and SAt). A similarity/dissimilarity analysis is evaluated by computing Euclidean distance between each two species' descriptors. Examination of similarity/dissimilarity among nine beta globin, nine ND5, and 24 coronaviruses protein sequences provided good results compared to previous approaches. The suggested approach is effective for both short and long sequences, and the computations are very simple. Furthermore, loss of sequence information is avoided. Correlation and significance analyses with PID% and ClustalW are also introduced to show the utility of our approach.",
