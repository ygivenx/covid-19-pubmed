            "text": "Lentiviruses are a genus of viruses that infect a broad range of mammalians, causing severe diseases mainly characterized by immunological and neurological deficiencies. They belong to the Retroviridae family: as such, they are characterized by a ssRNA genome that, once retrotranscribed by the viral reverse trascriptase enzyme, integrates into the host cell chromosome in the provirus form. The provirus can then undergo a productive replicative cycle or remain in a dormant state known as \u201clatency\u201d. Among lentiviruses, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) was first characterized in 19831, 2 when it was proposed as the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-2, SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency virus) and FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency virus), together with HIV-1, are lentiviruses responsible for severe and often fatal acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-like diseases. Other lentiviruses, i.e. Visna/Maedi virus, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus (CAEV) cause different pathologies, such as neurological disorders, anemia and wasting or arthritis and encephalitis. Lentiviruses that infect cattle, such as Bovine Immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and Jembrana Disease Virus (JDV), result in further pathophysiologic events that range from asymptomatic to systemic acute diseases3. Despite the wide range of clinical effects of lentiviral infections and the high divergence in nucleotide (nt) composition of their genome4, all lentiviruses are similar in structure, genome organization, and mode of replication. Importantly, effective progression of the viral cycle relies on the proper function of the long terminal repeat (LTR): even if the LTR region varies in terms of length and composition, it always originates from the multi-step reverse transcription process, which makes 3 main LTR regions, namely U3, R and U5. Once integrated, the 5\u2032-LTR, and in particular its U3 region which is characterized by transcription factor binding sites, serves as unique viral promoter5. Each lentivirus has peculiar cis-acting regulatory sequences that are both essential for promoter activity and different from each other6. For example, the HIV-1 LTR is composed of 3 main sub-regions: the core, where GC-rich binding sites for Sp1 are located; the enhancer, just upstream of the core, containing binding sites for NF-\u03baB; a modulatory region that comprises binding sites for several transcription factors, including C/EBP factors.",

G4s are nucleic acids secondary structures that may form in single-stranded G-rich sequences under physiological conditions11\u201313. Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base-pairing to yield G-quartets, which stack to form the G4. The presence of K+ cations specifically supports G4 formation and stability14\u201316. In eukaryotes G4s have been shown to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, DNA recombination9, 13, 17\u201319. Expansion of G4-forming motifs has been associated with relevant human neurological disorders20\u201326. Formation of G4s in vivo has been consolidated by the discovery of cellular proteins that specifically recognize G4s27, 28 and the development of G4-specific antibodies29, 30.",

We showed that all primate lentiviruses have sequences capable of folding into G4 in the U3 region of their LTR promoter; as in HIV-1, the presence of G4s correlates with that of transcription factors binding sites, in particular Sp1 and NF\u03baB.

The viruses belonging to the lentivirus genus can be grouped according to their 5 host types. The primate group, which our reference HIV-1 group M belongs to, comprises viruses that naturally infect both human (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and non-human primates (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, SIV) mainly belonging to the Cercopithecidae family44. The SIV sub-group is the most abundant and composed of viruses isolated from 41 different primate species. Among these, 29 SIV genomes that include the entire LTR region are available: these were considered in our analysis (Fig. 1 and Supporting Table S1). The ovine-caprine group includes 3 viruses: Visna/Maedi virus, Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) and Ovine Lentivirus (OL); the bovine group consists of Bovine Immunodeficiency Virus (BIV) and Jembrana Disease Virus (JDV); the equine group is represented by Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV); the feline group comprises Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) that naturally infects members of the Felidae family (Supporting Table S1).\n",

The following G4 pattern was thus investigated: GGG\u22653N0\u201312GGG\u22653N0\u201312GGG\u22653N0\u201312GGG\u22653, where N is a 0\u201312 nt-long loop sequence. This initial analysis allowed to identify the main G4 forming regions, which were next manually analysed in terms of G-tracts, loop composition and size. This step was necessary to include G4s with a single-nt bulge; in fact, this type of G4 has been previously found in the HIV-1 LTR-IV G443. Two-stacked tetrads G4 structures were excluded from the analysis. Results are summarized in Fig. 1 and Supporting Table S1.",

The only exception in the SIV group is SIVmnd2, the LTR PQS of which displayed multiple G-runs with the potential of atypical G4 folding, such as three-stacked tetrad G4s with 2-nt bulges. PQSs of HIV-1 groups N and O were also quite different, being shorter (43 nts) and with unique G-patterns (Fig. 1).

In contrast, the possibility to form G4 is conserved even if the G4 pattern is different among strains (Supporting Fig. 1b).",

The JDV PQS also partially overlapped with a NF\u03baB binding site at its 3\u2032 end (Table 1). In addition, the HIV-1 LTR G4s were associated to three Sp1 binding sites (consensus sequence KGGGCGGRRY, K = G or T, R = A or G and Y = C or T)47. Since Sp1 binding sites for only a very few viruses are available in the literature, the establishment of a straightforward correlation between LTR G4s and Sp1 was not possible. We thus used the online software PhysBinder48 to predict Sp1 binding regions in the LTR of all lentiviruses with relevant PQSs. In the primate lentiviruses, 30 out of 32 subgroups displayed Sp1 binding sites that overlapped with the PQS (Table 1). HIV-1 N and SIVwrc were two exceptions: the former was the only genome that displayed three NF\u03baB binding sites overlapping with the PQS and no Sp1 binding site; the latter was the only genome that lacked both NF\u03baB and Sp1 binding sites.

HIV-1 groups M and N originated from independent jumps from chimpanzee55 and HIV-1 group O from the western gorilla subspecies Gorilla gorilla\n56, resulting in HIV-1 strains with very different pathogenic potential: HIV-1 group M causes the well-known AIDS pandemic, groups N and O cause a milder disease and have been limited to a few individuals mostly in Cameroon57, 58. This phylogenetic analysis on one hand further supports the central role of G4 formation in the LTR, since this feature was maintained in multiple and unrelated cross-species transmission from a simian ancestor strain, and it explains why all primate lentiviruses display PQSs in the same LTR U3 region; on the other it gives reason of the substantial differences in PQS among strains.\n",

In the presence of K+ and BRACO-19, premature stop sites appeared in most of the selected PQSs (Fig. 4a) and corresponded to the most 3\u2032-G-tract involved in G4 formation (Fig. 4b). In all cases, G4-specific stops were more pronounced in the presence of the G4 ligand (compare lanes + with lanes B in Fig. 4a) indicating that these G4s can be stabilized and in some cases induced by specific G4 ligands, consistently with previously reported data9. Sequences where no G4-related stops were obtained during the Taq polymerase elongation step at 47 \u00b0C, i.e. HIV N and SIVwrc (Fig. 4a), were further analysed at elongation at 37 \u00b0C to solve thermodynamically less stable secondary structures. In these conditions, these two sequences folded in G4s as well, as indicated by specific stops at the main G-tracts (Fig. 4a,b). Only SIVlhoest PQS folded in a unique G4 species, while all other tested sequences folded in 2 or 3 different G4s (Fig. 4a,b). Interestingly, PQSs of HIV-1 group M and SIVcpz not only were similar in terms of number of G-runs (Fig. 1, Table 1 and Supporting Table S1), conserved (Fig. 2) and phylogenetically related (Fig. 3), but were both also able to fold in 3 very similar and mutually exclusive G4 structures (Fig. 4a). Indeed, the predicted G4 species of SIVcpz fully coincided with those of HIV-1 group M9, 43 (Fig. 4b). PQSs in the 5\u2032-LTR of HIV-1 group O and group N were also able to fold in G4 even if HIV-1 group N G4s were probably less stable because they could be visualized only at the lower Taq polymerase elongation temperature. Unfortunately, it was not possible to investigate SIVgor G4s by Taq Polymerase Stop assay because an extremely stable premature stop that did not correspond to a G4 structure was present (Fig. 4a,b). This stop was probably due to a hairpin-like secondary structure with 10 base pairs, as predicted by a web-based DNA tool (https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer). As for viruses in the SIVsm/HIV-2 lineage, the behaviour of HIV-2, SIVmac and SIVsm G4s were extremely similar and in accordance to their relatedness in terms of sequence (Fig. 1) and evolutionary history (Fig. 3): they could effectively fold in at least two different G4s, the major one of which was located at the 3\u2032-end of the sequence (Fig. 4b) and mainly induced by the addition of BRACO-19 (Fig. 4a).\n",

The LTR G4s are also evolutionary related: on one hand the most similar LTR G4 regions (i.e. HIV-1 group M and SIVcpz, HIV-2 and SIVmac/SIVsm) belong to viruses that are phylogenetically the closest; on the other, LTR G4s in primate lentiviruses, while sharing the possibility to form G4, are diverse in sequence, possibly because of the early divergence of the different lineages from a common ancestor (Fig. 3).",

We have suggested that the HIV-1 group M LTR G4 complexity is necessary for the tuning of G4 modulation: in particular, initial evidence indicated that the least stable HIV-1 G4, LTR-IV, may be required to release the inhibitory activity of the most stable HIV-1 G4, LTR-III43.

Our data are in line with the previously reported association between G4s and Sp1 binding sites in human genes62.

In HIV-1 group M, we have previously shown that the sequence comprising NF\u03baB, which could in principle fold into an additional overlapping G4, does not fold in vitro in the presence of K+ or G4 ligands9. Considering the degree of conservation of this sequence just upstream of the Sp1 binding sites and the G4 folding region, we suggest two possibilities: i) the recruitment of NF\u03baB is necessary for processes that occur at the downstream G4 region; ii) there are additional cellular factors that induce G4 folding at this region. The former hypothesis is supported by the reported interaction of NF\u03baB and Sp1 in an orientation and position-dependent manner65, which, based on our present observations, may rely on G4 folding/unfolding equilibria. The latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that nucleolin, the major reported LTR G4 binding protein27, preferentially binds regions that form low stability G4s66. The effect of G4-inducing proteins is expected to be more pronounced in less intrinsically stable G4s regions, such as the NF\u03baB binding site, and thus biologically more significant.",

This feature is shared with other key viral elements, such as the Lys-tRNA primer-binding site (PBS) that is required to start reverse transcription67. Thus, the use of structural conserved elements in a mechanosensor-regulated mechanism appears a theme commonly exploited by lentiviruses to control crucial viral steps. A similar G4/iMotif mechanism has been recently proposed in the promoter of the c-myc oncogene68.",
