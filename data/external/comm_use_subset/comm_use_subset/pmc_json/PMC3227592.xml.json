To a large extent, the introduction of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) has curtailed viral replication below the detection limit (<50 copies/mL) and significantly reduced the devastating impact of HIV-1 [2]\u2013[5]. cART works by blocking infection of susceptible new cells, while the decay rate of plasma virus is determined by the life span of previously infected cells [6]. However, given the presence of intact HIV-1 reservoirs, including quiescent CD4+ T lymphocytes, bone marrow and brain [7]\u2013[8], as well as the development of viral escape mutants and drug resistance, viral replication goes unchecked by intensive therapy [9]\u2013[14]. All treated patients with full viral suppression actually have low-level, steady-state viremia [10], [15]\u2013[16].",

The HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein engages positive transcription elongation factor b (pTEFb) complex (cycT1 and CDK9), increasing RNA pol II activity and driving viral transcriptional elongation [17]\u2013[19]. Tat activity is enhanced by host factors such as Tat-associated histone acetylases (TAH), p300/CBP, GCN5, and P/CAF, as well as P300/CBP and GCN5 acetylate Tat at Lys 50 and 51 [20]\u2013[23]. P/CAF acetylates Lys 28 on Tat and increases its ability to recruit pTEFb complex [20]\u2013[22]. Thus, Tat is an important therapeutic target, having the ability to interrupt the viral life cycle. Coincidentally, no effective HIV-1 transcriptional inhibitor is yet available to complement cART. Thus, the alternative to keeping the virus in an under-expressed state until the infected cells have died is to inhibit HIV-1 transcription and subsequent viral protein synthesis, which requires new inhibitors.",

They have shown therapeutic value, including antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties [24]\u2013[27]. Luteolin (2-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)- 5,7-dihydroxy-4-chromenone), myricetin, and quercetin, which are structurally related flavones (Fig. 1a), act as anti-oxidants and free-radical scavengers, dramatically reducing inflammatory responses [24]\u2013[25], [28]\u2013[32]. Their anti-oxidant property is related to the number and position of their hydroxyl groups [33]. Luteolin occurs in parsley, artichoke leaves, celery, peppers, olive oil, rosemary, lemons, peppermint, sage, and thyme; it acts as an anti-oxidant and anti-viral agent and is now being used in clinical trials for the inhibition of neuro-inflammation [24], [29]. Luteolin also has been found to have anti-HIV-1 activity [31], [34]. Although luteolin is a promoter of carbohydrate metabolism and an immune system modulator, it has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) in macrophages and other immune cells [35]\u2013[36].",

We have investigated the ability of flavonoid compounds (Fig. 1A) to alter HIV-1 activity in screening assays using LTR-luciferase (TZM-bl) reporter cells and primary lymphocytes as infection models. TZM-bl cells are HeLa cells that stably express CD4 and CXCR4 receptors. They contain an integrated copy of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) fused with luciferase and beta galactosidase genes [41]. Expression of the indicator luciferase gene is under the control of LTR via transactivator Tat protein, which is synthesized by either the viral infection or the plasmid expression vector. TZM-bl cells were treated for 30 min with luteolin, quercetin, or myricetin at 5 \u00b5M and 10 \u00b5M concentrations before HIV-1 infection. Forty-eight hours later, the infected reporter cells were monitored for LTR activity using luciferase reporter assay. Intriguingly, all of the flavonoid compounds at 5 and 10 \u00b5M concentrations showed anti-HIV-1 activity, but luteolin was the most potent (Fig. 1B). HIV-1 inhibition by luteolin was specific, as vehicle control (DMSO) had no effect on LTR activity. To rule out interference by toxicity, we monitored cell viability after flavonoid treatments, using the WST8 cell\u2013viability assay [42] on TZM-bl cells. None of the compounds showed any cellular cytotoxicity at 10 \u00b5M concentrations (Fig. 1C). Although, luteolin showed slight toxicity in TZM-bl reporter cells, it was found, on verification on Hela and Jurkat cells (Fig. 2A) and lymphocytes, to be relatively nontoxic. The toxicity of luteolin in TZM-bl cells could result from the presence of multiple stable constructs in these cells. Moreover, earlier studies on several cell systems have reported that luteolin in concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M [43] had no adverse effects. Our data suggest that the flavonoids actively inhibited HIV-1 activity, possibly through malfunctioning of Tat activity. This could be due to blockage at any step in the viral life cycle.",

Luteolin in concentrations between 5 and 10 \u00b5M, the upper limit for therapeutic agents used in screening assays, had significant antiviral activity. Thus, we used luteolin at 5 and 10 \u00b5M for all experiments (Fig. 2). We confirmed the anti-HIV-1 activity of luteolin in infection assays in lymphocytic cells and primary human lymphocytes using either wild-type (NLENG1) or VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1. In infection studies, we used HIV-1 NLENG1 containing GFP gene cloned between the envelope and nef region [44], [45]. Thus, we could monitor productive viral gene expression not only by GFP expression, using fluorescence microscopy, but by HIV-1 p24 capsid protein in the supernatants, which was detected by ELISA [42], [44].",

Luteolin treatment markedly reduced the HIV-1 infection in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B\u2013D) in a dose-dependent manner as shown by reductions in both the number of GFP-positive cells and viral p24 release in the supernatants on the fifth day after infection. To confirm these above findings and also rule out the cell\u2013specific inhibition of HIV-1, we infected TZM-bl cells and obtained similar suppression of viral infection (Fig. 3A\u2013D). Although treatment with luteolin prior to HIV-1 infection had no additional advantage on virus replication as compared with overnight treatment after HIV-1 infection (Fig. 3C, D). Instead better HIV-1 inhibition was seen with the latter, indicating that luteolin may affect the later stages of the HIV-1 life cycle rather than restricting the virus at the receptor, reverse transcription or viral DNA integration steps.",

Before these studies, we confirmed that luteolin was non-toxic to primary cells (Fig. 4A). We treated wild-type and VSV-HIV-1 infected lymphocytes with 5 and 10 \u00b5M of luteolin until follow-up and monitored for viral infection by GFP expression and the release of p24 in culture supernatants (Fig. 4B\u2013D). Luteolin treatment alleviated HIV-1 infection (wild\u2013type or VSV-HIV) as shown by a reduction in GFP expression (Fig. 4B) and p24 levels in the supernatants following virus release at 2, 4, and 6 days after infection (Fig. 4C, D). In parallel, 5, 6- dichloro- 1-\u03b2 -D-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole (DRB), a transcriptional inhibitor (RNA pol II inhibitor) was used as a positive control, while vehicle (DMSO) was used as a solvent control. DRB suppresses HIV-1 transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase activity [46]\u2013[47]. Interestingly, luteolin treatment of HIV-1 infected lymphocytes also showed inhibition in cell aggregation/syncytia similar to that produced by DRB and cell control (Fig. 4B), suggesting that viral envelope (gp120) protein expression on cell surfaces is impaired. Viral gp120 expression on infected cells is required for syncytia formation or aggregation of cells. In addition, luteolin did not affect the proliferation of lymphocytes during viral inhibition studies.",

After 24 h, viral infection was monitored by GFP expression and viral integration, using Alu-LTR PCR as described (Fig. 5D, E). In parallel, we used integrase-defective mutant HIV-1 (D64A) as a control [50], [51]. As compared to vehicle controls, luteolin-mediated suppression of HIV-1 expression was evident irrespective of the time after infection when treatment was initiated (4\u201312 h) (Fig. 5D). The weak suppression in integration signal as compared to that in untreated infected cells (Fig. 5E) was in contrast to a previous report showing exclusive effect on viral integration [31]. Intriguingly, the suppression of HIV-1 infection in cells treated with luteolin at 12 h post-infection suggests that luteolin has an inhibitory effect on the HIV-1 life cycle mainly if not exclusively at the postintegration stage.",

After treating the cells with luteolin or vehicle control (DMSO), we monitored viral gene expression using the LTR-luciferase assay. In this system, Tat expression from HIV-1 DNA drives LTR-luciferase expression, which was quantified luminometrically. Luteolin treatment markedly inhibited HIV-1 gene expression (or at least Tat expression) as compared to that in control TZM-bl reporter cells (Fig. 6A).

As compared to controls, luteolin-treated VSV-HIV-1-infected reporter cells profoundly suppressed the Tat-regulated luciferase signal similar to that in HIV-1 plasmid DNA transfection (Fig. 6A), suggesting aborted viral replication. DMSO controls also showed some suppression in luciferase signal in both HIV-1 DNA transfected and VSV-virus infected TZM-bl cells. One possibility is that DMSO affects luciferase expression either at the mRNA level or via CMV promoter. However, we confirmed our HIV-1 inhibition results on Magi cells (CD4/CCR5+ve HeLa cells) using GFP and viral p24 as markers. We transfected these cells with recombinant HIV-1 plasmid DNA vector expressing GFP (NLENG1), then treated them with luteolin for 12\u201324 h. At 48 h after transfection, we monitored GFP expression and viral p24 antigen in the supernatants, finding that luteolin treatment suppressed both (Fig. 6B, C), which suggested inhibition at the post-HIV-1 DNA integration step. We are convinced that small inhibition in DMSO-treated VSV-HIV-1 infected cultures or HIV-1 DNA transfected reporter cells was made possible by the effect on viral (VSV) endocytosis. However, we do not underestimate the true effect of luteolin, which was corroborated by inhibition of wild-type infection, HIV-1 DNA-mediated LTR transactivation, and post-integration viral state without any inhibitory effect of DMSO. Antiviral activity of luteolin is clearly shown in wild\u2013type HIV-1 infection studies wherein DMSO did not confer any antiviral activity. These results ruled out any additive effect of DMSO with luteolin on HIV inhibition.",

To further examine luteolin-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 at post\u2013DNA integration stages, we did experiments on latently HIV-1 infected THP89 cells, in which the HIV-1 genome contains the GFP gene. THP89 cells contain HIV-1 provirus in a latent state without any viral gene expression including GFP [44]. On induction by TNF-\u03b1 (NF-\u03baB activation) or Trichostatin A (histone deacetylase inhibitor), however, viral reactivation is initiated; cells start expressing GFP and release the virus extracellularly [32], [45], [48]. After THP89 cells had been pretreated with luteolin or DMSO for 18 h, viral reactivation was initiated using TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml). TNF-\u03b1- reactivated latent HIV-1 infection was attenuated by treatment with luteolin (10 \u00b5M), demonstrating reduction in GFP expression and released virus (p24) in 24, 48, and 72\u2013h induction periods (Fig. 7A\u2013B). This indicates that luteolin has an effect on post-viral DNA integration stages; that is viral transcription or translation or Tat functional activity. When Tat functional activity is impaired in a TNF-\u03b1 \u2014reactivated latent HIV-1 model, GFP expression, including viral proteins that are dependent on Tat function, will eventually be impaired, so that p24 activity is reduced in infected culture supernatants.",

GFP is cloned between env and nef genes [44]\u2013[45] and its expression is independent of viral protease activity, but dependent on Tat for transcription. To validate the infection data, we examined Tat function, using only Tat expression vectors to rule out other viral proteins. To mimic HIV-1 expressed Tat, we packaged lentiviral-vector- expressing Tat protein pseudotyped with VSV envelope (VSV-Tat). We used VSV-Tat viral particles for transduction of SVGA-LTR-GFP reporter cells expressing EGFP under the control of HIV-1 LTR [52]\u2013[53]. In parallel, VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1 was used as a positive control. Luteolin treatment following transduction with VSV-Tat virus particles led to suppression of LTR-mediated GFP expression (Fig. 7C), suggesting compromise in Tat function at either the protein expression level or the LTR-transactivation level. We corroborated these results using TZM-bl reporter cells. Transfection of pcDNA-Tat expression vector wherein Tat is under the control of CMV promoter, followed by treatment with different concentrations of luteolin (0\u201310 \u00b5M), resulted in dose-dependent suppression of LTR-luciferase expression, which did not occur in vehicle-treated or untreated cultures (Fig. 8A).",

Tat from HIV-1 subtype-C and E (prevalent in Asia and Africa) is reported to exhibit higher transactivation and TAR RNA binding capacity than does HIV-1 subtype-B (prevalent in North America and Europe) [54]\u2013[56]. Hence, we investigated whether luteolin-mediated suppression of Tat-mediated LTR-transactivation can be extended to different HIV-1 subtypes. On transfection of clade-B and C Tat expression vectors (pcDNA-Tat vectors) abundant expression of Tat proteins was found in TZM-bl cells (Fig. 8C, inset), with levels of LTR-transactivation similar to those in compared to controls observed in Western blots (Fig. 8C).

We transfected HeLa cells using Tat-HA vector and 6 h after transfection, then treated them with luteolin or DMSO or left them untreated. At 24 h after transfection, cells were immunostained for Tat, nucleophosmin (nucleolar protein), and nuclei, then examined for Tat localization. Tat sub-cellular (nuclear/nucleolar) localization was unaffected by luteolin, as in DMSO- or mock- treated cells (Fig. 8D). This indicates that viral transactivator protein function is impaired at the LTR-functional level, including either Tat binding to TAR RNA or cyclin T1/CDK9 or inhibition of critical factors, including NF-\u03baB, that are involved in HIV transcription (Fig. 9).",

            "text": "These observations confirm that luteolin confers its anti-HIV-1 activity at the Tat-LTR transactivation level (transcription step) after the viral integration step. However, further investigations of the action of luteolin are needed to decipher the detailed mechanism of Tat-mediated LTR inhibition. Currently, we are investigating the interactions of Tat with HIV-1 LTR and host transcription factors, as well as post\u2013translational modification on Tat in the presence of luteolin. Several compounds, such as Quinolines, as well as stilbene- and purine-derivatives have been reported to show anti-HIV activity, inhibiting Tat-TAR interactions [60]\u2013[64]. Other compounds, such as flavipiridol, rescovtine, and 9-amino acridine, targeted CDK9, a component of pTEFb complex [65]\u2013[67]. Recently, a coumarin derivative has been shown to potently inhibit HIV Tat function in nano\u2013molar concentrations by repressing p300 and PI3K/AKT [68]. This supports the possibility that luteolin leads to the development of potent derivatives to inhibit HIV in nano\u2013molar concentrations. Therefore, several other active derivatives of luteolin shown to have more potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties need to be investigated for anti-HIV-1 activity. Intriguingly, quercetin, a luteolin analogue, has been shown to repress proinflammatory miRNA-155 in macrophages in \u2013vivo [43], it would be interesting to determine whether luteolin has the same effect. One caveat is that luteolin may complement combination anti-HIV therapy by preventing synthesis of viral proteins available for protease steps. This would enhance the potency of protease inhibitors, eventually leading to reduced virus assembly and release.",

In addition, luteolin crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to confer neuroprotective effects via inhibition of neuroinflammation [28], [69]\u2013[71]. However, the concentrations of luteolin that we found to be inhibitory in our study are in the upper therapeutic ranges. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these concentrations are achieved in vivo. Further investigations in\u2013vivo and significance of luteolin with anti-HIV drugs whether it can act in synergism with lower concentrations, are the future goals. However, we have laid the foundation for development of luteolin derivatives that, in nanomolar ranges, may which could inhibit HIV-1. Currently, we are investigating the ability of 500 flavonoid derivatives to inhibit HIV in nano molar ranges.",
