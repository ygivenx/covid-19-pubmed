Among the infected individuals, seven (8.1%) were co-infected with other respiratory virus, whereby six individuals were dually co-infected with either rhinovirus (n = 3), adenovirus (n = 1), influenza B (n = 1) or coronavirus (n = 1) while one individual was triply co-infected with rhinovirus and influenza A. Co-infection with HRSV was not observed. The study population was comprised predominantly of females (61.6%, 53/86). Among 86 individuals infected with HMPV, 76.7% (n = 66) were adults (median age: 34.0 years, interquartile range, IQR, 26.0\u201354.0 years), 18.6% (n = 16) were elderly, defined as \u226565 years old2 (median age: 72.0 years, IQR, 69.8\u201375.0 years) and the remaining 4.7% (n = 4) were children (median age: 14.5 years, IQR, 12.8\u201316.3 years).

Overall, the patients reported a median total of 4.0 days (IQR, 3.0\u20137.0 days) since the onset of disease symptoms. Majority of the patients reported symptoms of cough (98.8%), followed by hoarseness of voice (89.5%), nasal discharge (72.1%), sneezing (70.9%), headache (69.8%), sore throat (69.8%), nasal congestion (67.4%) and muscle ache (65.1%).

Within genotype A, a total of 30.2% (26/86) of the newly-generated sequences clustered within the A2b sub-lineage. Interestingly, 18.6% (16/86) of the sequences clustered with a reference strain, HMPV CN/gz01/08/A2 (accession number: GQ153651) within a previously unrecognized sub-lineage of A2, supported by a strong bootstrap value of 98\u201399% in the phylogenies of both F and G genes. The unique clade was provisionally assigned as a novel sub-lineage of A2. In addition to Malaysia, previously published sequences from other countries (China, Vietnam, and Cambodia) were also grouped within this clade. Both A1 and A2a sub-lineages were not detected in our study population. Similarly, within genotype B, a total of 30.2% (26/86) of the sequences clustered within the B1 sub-lineage and 20.9% (18/86) of the sequences clustered within the B2 sub-lineage. In 2012, B1 sub-lineage circulated predominantly at 39.5% (15/38) of the population and a shift in the predominant genotype towards A2b (29.4%, 10/34) was observed in 2013 (Fig. 3). Between January and May 2014, both A2b and B2 sub-lineages co-circulated at equal prevalence at 35.7% (5/14). In addition to samples collected from four children in our current study population, phylogenetic analysis of the F and G genes sequenced from 21 paediatric patients recruited between April 2010 and December 2012 (median age: 1.84 years, IQR, 1.11\u20133.40) revealed that 52.0% (13/25) of the sequences clustered within the novel sub-lineage of A2, followed by A2b and B1 at 20.0% (5/25) each, and A2a and B2 at 4.0% (1/25) each (Fig. 2A,B).

Sequences within the novel sub-lineage of A2 were highly identical at both nucleotide and amino acid levels in both F and G genes (F gene, nt: 99.1% and aa: 97.5% and G gene: nt: 95.7% and aa: 95.5%). Next, we estimated the inter-genotype mean genetic distances of the HMPV genotypes and sub-lineages (Table 2). Sub-lineage distances between genotypes A and B were high in both F and G genes, estimated around 17.7\u201319.3% and 77.8\u201388.3%, respectively. Sub-lineage distances within genotype were estimated around 5.9\u20137.5% and 22.6\u201326.9% in the F and G genes, respectively. Within A2, genetic distances between sub-lineages A2a and A2b were 3.8% in the F gene and 13.0% in the G gene. Notably, the genetic distances between these sub-lineages and the novel sub-lineage of A2 were similar or higher, estimated around 3.6\u20134.4% and 11.9\u201312.9% in both the F and G genes, respectively. Specific amino acid substitutions were also present within the novel sub-lineage of A2 in the G protein, but not in the F gene. In comparison with A2a and A2b sub-lineages, eleven specific amino acid substitutions in the novel sub-lineage of A2 were identified at positions 40, 59, 93, 106, 148, 164, 188, 197, 199, 216 and 227 (Table 3). Taken together, based on the phylogenetic tree topology, genetic distances and specific amino acid substitution analyses in both the F and G genes, the newly identified sub-lineage was distinct from the previously described A2a and A2b sub-lineages.",

            "text": "In order to elucidate the dynamics of HMPV transmission among the adults and children population in the present study, we constructed transmission networks based on the pairwise distances using the TN93 model estimated from the newly-sequenced F and G genes. The lower 0.025 percentile of the inter-person genetic distances from database sequences, which represented the patristic distance cutoff for transmission cluster interpretation, were estimated at 0.2% and 1.2% for the F and G genes, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). In the F gene data set, 19 sequences (22.4%, 19/85) formed a total of nine clusters (comprising of eight dyads and one network) while in the G gene, 11 sequences (13.4%, 11/82) formed a total of five clusters (comprising of four dyads and one network), ranging between two and three individuals in size (Fig. 4A). Of these clusters, only two dyads and one network were concordant in both genes. Overall, more transmission clusters were observed in the A2b sub-lineage than other sub-lineages in both the F (57.9%, 11/19) and G (63.6%, 7/11) genes. A known transmission pair of two epidemiologically-linked adult and child infected with the novel A2 sub-lineage was also observed in the F (but not in the G) gene. HMPV has been reported to be highly infectious within the first 4\u20136 days of infection28, after which its ability to cause infection in another individual declines. Hence we proceed to estimate the difference between estimated date of infection (denoted as \u0394EDI) between existing members of clusters observed in the F and G genes to evaluate the reliability of the genetic-based approach in inferring transmission network. We found that a majority of the clusters inferred in the F (8/9 clusters) and G genes (4/5 clusters) had \u0394EDIs of \u22647 days which provided substantial validation of the method used in this study (Fig. 4A). Of note, the frequency of transmission clusters identified during the study period coincided with an increase in the detection of the respective HMPV sub-lineages in the population, as observed in the A2b (between September 2012 and April 2013) and B1 (between March and April 2012) sub-lineages (Fig. 4A,B).",

In addition, the seasonality and dynamics of disease transmission in countries with a tropical climate have not been analysed in detail. In the present study, we reported the recent molecular epidemiology of HMPV in an outpatient population of adults and children presented with symptoms of acute URTI in Kuala Lumpur during a two-year period. From 3,935 nasopharyngeal swabs collected between 2012 and 2014, the average prevalence of HMPV in the population was fairly low at around 2%, similar to previous studies conducted across all ages6. Conversely, HMPV was more prevalent among children in the hospitalised or community setting, with a reported prevalence of over 5% particularly among the young and immunocompromised children1342530. Although the overall prevalence of HMPV infection was low in our study population, a relatively higher monthly prevalence of up to 4\u20135% was observed during the November\u2013April period (Fig. 1), coincided with the northeast monsoon season which typically occurs in the region between October and March. We also showed that the prevalence of HMPV was significantly correlated with high relative humidity and the number of rainy days.",

Meanwhile, sub-lineages A1 and A2a were not detected in our study population. Similarly, sub-lineage A1 which circulated in China31, was also not detected in the neighbouring regions including Cambodia6, Thailand8 and Singapore4; and worldwide after 2006, in Austria13, Argentina32, Australia33, Canada12, and the United States3435. On the other hand, sub-lineage A2a circulated widely at a low prevalence in other countries including Thailand8 and Canada36. Both A2b and B1 circulated predominantly in the population, with a combined prevalence of around 60% (Fig. 3). We also observed a shift in the predominant circulating genotype from sub-lineage B1 to A2b in the population between 2012 and 2013, although a longer study period with more samples may be required to provide an accurate representation. Recently, genotype A2 has been associated with a more severe disease in hospitalised children in Jordan and Cambodia637. Further studies to assess the impact of HMPV genotypes on disease severity are warranted. In addition to the known sub-lineages, a previously unreported sub-lineage of A2 was identified at a lower prevalence at around 19% in the population. Phylogenetic and pairwise distance analyses of the F and G genes sequence data including all publicly available global reference sequences confirmed the novelty of the sub-lineage which was distinct from other known sub-lineages within A2, such as A2a and A2b (Fig. 2, Table 2). More than half of the F and G sequences previously amplified among Malaysian children between 2010 and December 20127 were grouped within the novel sub-lineage of A2. Furthermore, several reference F and G gene sequences isolated from neighbouring countries including Vietnam, Cambodia and China, sampled between 2006 and 2011 also clustered with the Malaysian sequences within the novel sub-lineage of A2 and further suggesting that the novel sub-lineage of A2 might have been circulating in the region at a lower prevalence earlier (Fig. 2). Further studies however are required to estimate its time of emergence in our study population and whether the proposed novel sub-lineage of A2 is also circulating in other regions besides Southeast and East Asia. Complete genome sequencing followed by rigorous phylogenetic and genetic distance analyses of the novel sub-lineage of A2 are necessary to confirm its assignment as a distinct sub-lineage.",

However the inclusion of transmission network information could elucidate the spread and dynamics of a disease attributed to specific genotypes or sub-lineages circulating in the population that further corroborate the observation from epidemiological surveillance of a disease. Using programming language-based approach, we inferred the transmission network of HMPV in the population based on the genetic sequences of the F and G genes. To the best of our knowledge, such analysis represents the first of which the spread and dynamics of HMPV transmission in the general population was mapped. Using the estimated cutoffs for the pairwise genetic distance between HMPV sequences and the EDI between individuals, below which individuals were classified as a transmission cluster, we identified up to nine transmission clusters (in the F gene) of HMPV circulating in the cohort between 2012 and 2014 (Fig. 4A). The size of these clusters was generally small (dyads) and involved various HMPV sub-lineages, suggesting the presence of multiple sub-epidemics in the population with no apparent evidence of a major outbreak. Nonetheless, the increased frequency of transmission clusters correlated with the incidence of HMPV detection (Fig. 3B), indicating the potential roles of transmission clusters in driving the spread of respiratory infections. We were also able to estimate the directionality of viral transmission between individuals within the cluster, which allows the identification of the putative donor/recipient that may be important in facilitating efforts to minimize forward transmission18. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the transmission clusters inferred herein reflected the genetic relatedness of the viral sequences and their direction of transmission, without implying an actual (direct) viral transmission between clustered individuals181924.",

Firstly, to improve the cluster resolution and minimize potential discrepancies in the analysis, estimated clusters should be interpreted in parallel with information of contact history among members of a cluster, if available41. Likewise, the suitability of a genetic region can be determined through known transmission pairs sampled from well-documented outbreaks by assessing the reproducibility of the cluster features using multiple partial and even the complete genomes. In addition, although cluster overestimation may be unlikely in our analysis where the upper distance cutoffs were set below the lower 0.025 percentile of inter-person genetic distances2442, the availability of the intra-person genetic distances will nonetheless provide a better clue on the lower distance cutoffs. Due to the interim and self-limiting nature of the infection, it is indeed a challenge to collect serial samples throughout acute illness, which will not immediately benefit the patients. Lastly, as in many other molecular epidemiological surveillance studies, only a subset of the population was recruited and analysed. Therefore, the size, frequency and structure of the transmission clusters observed could have been more accurate by increasing the sample size involving more recruitment sites (but not necessarily longer study duration).",

A transmission cluster is characterised by the presence of at least two individuals (represented by nodes) whose viral sequences are genetically linked (represented by edges) at a given genetic distance threshold or cutoff1819. The genetic distance cutoff values can be determined between the highest and lowest values of intra- and inter-person distances (known as the patristic distances), respectively2442. However, since HMPV is associated with acute infection, measuring intra-person viral genetic distance is often challenging and impractical due to rapid viral clearance within a host. We therefore estimated the most probable cutoff values by determining the lower 0.025 percentile of the inter-person genetic distances calculated from the global F (n = 66) and G (n = 45) reference sequences representing all known genotypes and sub-lineages. Sequences from different individuals with genetic distance falling below these cutoffs were classified as transmission cluster. Clusters were described as dyads if they contain two nodes, and network if >2 nodes19. The estimated date of infection (EDI) for each individual was predated from the number of days after disease symptoms onset as reported by the patients and the incubation period of 4\u20136 days for HMPV28. Difference between EDI for each individual was denoted as \u0394EDI. In addition to genetic distance cutoff, adjacent nodes with a \u0394EDI of less than 30 days were considered in cluster construction (viral shedding beyond 30 days following primary infection is probably uncommon, hence viral transmission may be very limited or absent). Such criterion was used for an acute infection in order to improve the analytical power of cluster determination by effectively eliminating genetically similar but epidemiologically unrelated viruses that may complicate transmission cluster interpretation. Probable direction of virus transmission within a cluster was also estimated by placing a directed edge from the putative \u201cdonor\u201d node to the \u201crecipient\u201d node(s), where the EDIdonor is older than the EDIrecipient18.",

The three common transmission clusters identified in both genes were highlighted in circles (dotted lines). Probable direction of disease transmission within a cluster was estimated by placing a directed edge from the putative \u201cdonor\u201d node to the \u201crecipient\u201d node(s), where the estimated date of infection, EDIdonor is older than the EDIrecipient18.
