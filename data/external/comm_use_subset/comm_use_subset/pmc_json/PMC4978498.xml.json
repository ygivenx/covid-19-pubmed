            "text": "At each breath, the lung is challenged by a large number and diversity of microbes and other foreign material such as pollen and dust. Many inhaled microbes cause lethal infections if not contained by the lung immune system, which has evolved to balance rapid and efficient microbial clearance with protection of the delicate lung structure from excessive damage. Lung damage caused by microbial pathogens is the cause of acute lung injury (ALI), which leads to increased edema, alveolar permeability, and impaired oxygen exchange. In severe cases, ALI can result in impaired gas exchange function and ultimately death (acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS) [1]. To mitigate lung damage after infection, inflammation resolves, returning to homeostasis that restores normal lung function [2,3]. The air-interface structure of the lung involves a complex immune cell population including resident interstitial macrophages and dendritic cells, and GM-CSF-dependent alveolar macrophages [4\u20137]. A key question in understanding pulmonary immunity concerns how the balance between effective immune surveillance and maintenance of lung anatomy and physiology is achieved through life.",

In the lung microenvironment, \u03b26 (encoded by Itgb6) exclusively pairs with the \u03b1V subunit and expression of the \u03b1V\u03b26 heterodimer is limited to epithelial cells. In this context, \u03b1V\u03b26 plays a key role in controlling several steps in lung homeostasis. Mice lacking the \u03b26 subunit (\u03b26 KO) have highlighted the central role \u03b1V\u03b26 integrin plays in balancing the pulmonary environment during injury [9,10]. For example, in both bleomycin-induced and PAR1-mediated ventilator-associated lung injury and airway hyper-responsiveness models, \u03b26 KO mice were protected from ALI [11\u201313]. \u03b26 KO mice also had reduced IL-1\u03b2-mediated lung injury in a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to decreased inflammation and cellular infiltrate to the lung [14]. Alveolar macrophages isolated from \u03b26 KO are characterized as large and foamy and express high amounts of MMP12 [15,16].",

For example, patients with SARS and MERS-CoV were found to have increased infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, accumulation of debris in the lung, and diffuse alveolar damage [20,21]. Similarly, elderly patients suffering from RSV sustained widespread alveolar damage [22]. Bacterial pneumonia can result in increased formation of hyaline membranes [23]. Deposition of collagen and fibrin, while necessary for lung repair, can also build up and block gas exchange [24]. In the case of influenza, the major complication leading to ALI/ARDS is pulmonary edema and impaired fluid clearance due to dysregulation of transporters that clear fluid from the alveolus such as ENaC and Na+K+ATPase [23,25,26]. The virus itself can also directly kill epithelial cells [27]. ALI/ARDS has a mortality rate of 30\u201350%, therefore it is critical from a public health perspective to understand the mechanisms at play [28,29].",

To test this, \u03b26 KO mice were infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. \u03b26-deficient mice were protected from influenza virus-induced disease as well as a broad range of respiratory pathogens, in most cases independent of effects on overall microbial numbers. Mechanistically, we found that epithelial \u03b26 controls the homeostatic lung interferon response. In the absence of \u03b26, type I interferon signaling is constitutive, causing the host to have an advantage over the spread of the virus. This protective phenotype was reversed by exogenous TGF-\u03b21 or elimination of the type I interferon receptor, suggesting that \u03b1V\u03b26 controls a communication system between lung epithelia and immune cells through a TGF-\u03b2-dependent mechanism. These studies have important implications as transient inhibition of \u03b1V\u03b26 may represent a potential therapy for the management of acute lung injury.",

Thus, we hypothesized that upregulation of the \u03b26 integrin during respiratory infections would be involved in viral pathogenesis. To test this, we measured \u03b26 expression by quantitative RT-PCR at different times post-influenza infection. Consistent with lung injury models, \u03b26 mRNA was significantly upregulated in whole lung homogenates by 3 days post-infection (dpi) and expression remained elevated through 5 dpi (p < 0.0001) correlating with the appearance of ALI (Fig 1A). We then intranasally infected WT and Itgb6-deficient mice (\u03b26 KO mice) with A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1 virus and monitored morbidity for 12 dpi. Compared to WT controls, \u03b26 KO mice lost significantly less weight (4, 6, and 8 dpi p < 0.0001) and began to recover by 10 dpi, while WT mice lost weight and either succumbed to infection or were euthanized due to morbidity between 6\u201310 dpi (Fig 1B and 1C). The dose of CA/09 virus used (104 TCID50) was lethal to all WT mice, while 70% \u03b26 KO mice survived the infection (p = 0.0090). Mouse lethal dose 50 (MLD50) studies demonstrated the resistance of the \u03b26 KO to influenza infection, with WT mice having an MLD50 of 102.5 versus 105.3 for the KO to the CA/09 virus. Protection was not limited to H1N1 infection; \u03b26 KO mice were also protected from an emerging strain of avian influenza virus associated with severe and even fatal human respiratory disease [17], A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza virus (p = 0.0326, Fig 1D). \u03b26 KO mice were also significantly protected from a lethal challenge of Sendai virus (p = 0.006, Fig 1E) and Streptococcus pneumonia (p = 0.0082, Fig 1F).",

In marked contrast, evidence of inflammation and tissue damage in the \u03b26 KO lungs was generally limited to terminal bronchioles and small numbers of adjacent alveoli (Fig 2A). Infected WT mice had increased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 throughout the duration of infection, while the inflammatory cytokine response in \u03b26 KO mice was less robust (Fig 2B). Evidence of alterations to the alveolar capillary barrier was found in infected WT mice beginning at 5 dpi as compared to KO mice (Fig 2C\u20132F) including heavier lungs as determined by wet/dry weight ratios (5 dpi p = 0.0077, 7 dpi p = 0.0063) indicating increased edema (Fig 2C), accompanied by increased total protein (p < 0.0001, Fig 2D) and albumin in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (7 dpi p < 0.0001, Fig 2E) and accumulation of Evans blue dye in the lungs of WT mice (p = 0.0071, Fig 2F).

However, tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) and quantitative real-time PCR showed no significant differences in viral titers, although RT-PCR suggested a trend towards lower titers in \u03b26 KO mice (Fig 3A and 3B). We therefore spatially monitored viral spread in the lungs by immunohistochemistry for viral nucleoprotein (NP) and use of a reporter virus [34,35]. Viral spread into the alveolar spaces was reduced in \u03b26 KO mice in comparison to WT mice, which had extensive NP staining of type II pneumocytes and macrophages in the alveolar spaces by 5 dpi. In contrast, NP staining in \u03b26 KO mice was largely restricted to the terminal bronchiolar epithelium and adjacent alveoli (Fig 3C). This is even more evident using our NLuc CA/09 reporter virus, which clearly demonstrates decreased virus in \u03b26 KO ([34,35], S1 Fig). Finally, WT lungs had a higher percentage of sites of active infection at 5 and 7 dpi as well as more viral antigen detected in the alveolar spaces (Fig 3D and 3E). Collectively, viral spread in KO lungs was limited compared to WT mice, with less extensive involvement of alveolar epithelial cells possibly explaining the improved lung function relative to controls. These findings are consistent with studies suggesting that increased survival during influenza infection can be independent of changes in viral titers [36\u201340].",

No significant differences were noted in numbers of TNF-\u03b1/iNOS-producing (tip)DCs, neutrophils, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or influenza PB1-specific CD8+ T cells in either BALF (Fig 4A\u20134E) or whole lung (Fig 4F\u20134J). However, we noted substantial differences in the resident lung F480+ CD11c+ CD11b+ populations (macrophages and dendritic cells), namely that \u03b26 KO mice lacked a conventional CD11c+ alveolar macrophage (AM) population (Fig 5A). AMs have characteristic flow cytometry properties as compared to dendritic cells (DCs) or incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes including autofluoresence in the FITC channel, high constitutive expression of CD11c, F4/80 and SiglecF and low expression of CD11b [4,41,42]. By contrast, incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes express CD11b, providing a means to distinguish between resident AM, inflammatory bone marrow-derived monocytes and DCs [4,43]. When we examined the lung macrophage/DC populations in uninfected \u03b26 KO mice we found they had higher numbers of autofluorescent cells indicating AMs (Fig 5B) but instead of the normal CD11chi CD11b- phenotype, the vast majority of the \u03b26 KO AM were MerTK+, CD64+, CD11c+, and uniformly CD11b+ (Fig 5C; See S2 and S3 Figs for gating strategies). These cells maintained expression of F4/80 and SiglecF, suggesting they are AMs with altered properties. They were also phenotypically distinct from those of WT mice, with a \u2018foamy\u2019 appearance typical of activated macrophages (Fig 5D). Importantly, the \u03b26 KO CD11c+ CD11b+ AM were present at the earliest times tested (d3 after birth), continued to be present at all points of adulthood (S4A Fig), and were not affected by reducing neonatal exposure to airborne particulate matter by using HEPA-filtered cages or low dust cage bedding (S4B Fig). Even throughout the course of influenza infection very few CD11chi CD11b- cells were present in the lungs of \u03b26 KO mice (Fig 5E). As the lungs from \u03b26 KO were overtly normal, we concluded the CD11c+ CD11b+ cells were sufficient to perform the normal activities of lung homeostasis [12,14,16,30].",

To test whether the \u03b26 KO CD11c+ CD11b+ AM were predominantly derived from embryonic progenitors, we created mice where the blood monocyte pool was severely depleted by loss of the chemokine receptor CCR2, which is the predominant mediator for monocyte egress from the bone marrow. In the lungs of \u03b26/CCR2 doubly-deficient mice, CD11c+ CD11b+ AM were present in identical amounts compared with those of \u03b26 KO mice, arguing these cells are unlikely to be derived from peripheral blood monocytes (S4C Fig). Although other unknown pathways to recruit monocytes to the lung cannot be discounted, they are not as well characterized or understood as the CCR2 pathway. Taken together, we concluded loss of an epithelial integrin alters the phenotype of lung AMs.",

Importantly, the effect of the \u03b26 KO lung microenvironment was not unique to transferred AM. Adoptive transfer of peritoneal resident macrophages into \u03b26 KO animals resulted in conversion into the CD11c+ CD11b+ AM phenotype (Fig 6D and 6E) highlighting that it is the altered lung microenvironment of the \u03b26 KO that controls AM phenotype.

Thus, we next asked if the altered macrophage phenotype in the \u03b26 KO mice was TGF-\u03b21 dependent. As expected, endogenous lung TGF-\u03b21 activity was reduced in \u03b26 KO mice as compared to WT (Fig 7A). To test the hypothesis that reduced TGF-\u03b21 activity contributed to the altered lung microenvironment of \u03b26 KO mice, we intranasally administered exogenous TGF-\u03b21 to WT and \u03b26 KO mice every other day for 3 weeks (Fig 7B) as described [46]. \u03b26 KO mice treated with TGF-\u03b21 had increased numbers of CD11c+CD11b- macrophages (Fig 7C, quantification Fig 7D), partially reversing the CD11c+CD11b+ phenotype, and were no longer protected from influenza infection (Fig 7E) suggesting that the loss of \u03b26-mediated TGF-\u03b21activation is important for both protection and the \u2018activated\u2019 macrophage phenotype.",

Thus, we tested the hypothesis that \u03b26 KO mice had increased type I IFN than WT. We used phosphorylated STAT1 levels (pSTAT1) as a marker for type I IFN signaling. Increased pSTAT1 along with increased type I IFN gene expression and unchanged expression of type II IFN-dependent targets such as IDO1 are indicative of a type I IFN dominated environment. Further, STAT1 is a robust marker of type I IFN signaling due to its weak activation by other cytokines such as IL-6 [47]. Immunoblot analysis of whole lung homogenates showed the \u03b26 KO mice had robust type I IFN signaling at baseline that increased 3\u20135 dpi (Fig 8A). We sought to determine the source of type I IFNs and how epithelial-expressed \u03b26 regulated the IFN response. We noted that type I IFN mRNAs were not substantially altered in uninfected \u03b26 KO mice (S6A\u2013S6D Figs). Furthermore, ELISA measurements for type I IFNs did not show substantial differences between WT and \u03b26 KO mice within whole lung homogenates. Therefore, we generated \u03b26 KO mice crossed to an IFN-\u03b2-YFP reporter strain. In these mice, YFP expression in the whole lung was predominantly found in CD45+ cells and increased in the absence of \u03b26 (Fig 8B); although immunofluorescent microscopy of frozen lung sections from WT and \u03b26 KO YFP reporter mice showed increased YFP+ cells scattered throughout the lung; including in the epithelia (Fig 8C and 8D). Further delineation of the exact cell types in this system expressing YFP is precluded by the strong autofluorescence in the FITC channel in lung macrophages [4]. Thus, we examined isolated AMs and primary epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface from \u03b26 KO and WT mice for increased type I IFN signaling.",

In our hands, assays quantitating type I IFN amounts by ELISA or bead-based assays are variable, lacking sensitivity or reproducibility. Furthermore, the potential increase in type I receptor expression on \u03b26 KO macrophages (Table 1) could cause increased uptake of type I IFNs and not accurately reflect the soluble amounts present in the lung at a given time in homeostasis.

Compared to WT controls, \u03b26 KO mice develop less severe ALI, as characterized by edema, inflammatory cytokine expression, and vascular permeability of the lung epithelium. \u03b26 KO mice also have altered baseline homeostasis possessing high baseline CD11b+ CD11c+ macrophages as opposed to CD11b- CD11c+ alveolar macrophages. A reasonable interpretation of these data is that \u03b26 KO mice are \u2018primed\u2019 for a more efficient response to respiratory pathogens, due to constitutively increased type I IFN signaling at baseline. Importantly, protection extended beyond pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strain to include other influenza virus strains, Sendai virus, and S. pneumoniae infection. However, protection did not extend to all infections tested. We challenged \u03b26 KO mice with Francisella tularensis Schu4 strain using 25 live organisms via the intranasal route. Schu4-infected \u03b26 KO mice had no differences in survival compared to controls consistent with experiments performed in the Ifnar\n-/- mice [49] (CB, personal communication) (S8A Fig). Although \u03b26 KO mice were significantly protected from disease caused by H7N9 virus (Fig 1D) they were not protected from the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Hong Kong/483/1997 H5N1 infection (HK/483, S8B Fig). HPAI H5N1 viruses are unique in their ability to rapidly spread beyond the respiratory tract and cause systemic, including neurological, disease [18] and productively replicate in alveolar macrophages [50]. It is possible that HPAI H5N1 viruses are more resistant to type I IFN, that mice succumb due to direct viral cytopathic effect, or complications of systemic infection. Further studies are needed to understand why \u03b26 KO mice are not protected against HPAI H5N1 infection. Taken together, these data suggest \u03b26-mediated modulation of IFN responses affects responses to multiple respiratory pathogens whereas protective responses depend on IFN signaling.",

            "text": "The airway epithelium is a complex barrier comprised of multiple cell types that acts as an interface between the external environment and the internal lung milieu. It serves three main functions in a healthy lung; providing a tight mechanical barrier that rapidly repairs upon insult, mediating innate immune activity to limit foreign antigen invasion, and initiating an inflammatory response through production of cytokines and chemokines [51]. A variety of experimental models and human studies demonstrate the host response to respiratory infection involves initiation, resolution, and restoration phases, all of which must be tightly regulated to prevent disease [52]. However, little is known about how interactions between epithelial cells, which are often the primary targets of respiratory pathogens, and alveolar macrophages, which play a critical role in controlling infections, and the regulation of these responses. Our data identify a pathway by which alveolar epithelial cells normally suppress the anti-microbial activity of alveolar macrophages through a pathway that may involve local activation of TGF-\u03b2 and subsequent suppression of IFN signaling. In terms of homeostasis, little is known about how type I IFNs control the status of tissue microenvironments. Most work on type I IFN signaling has been associated with anti-viral responses and the regulation of inflammation over the first 18\u201324 months of life [16]. The implication of our findings is that the lung can tolerate a homeostatic increase in IFN signaling, which provides an advantage against viral spread, but likely comes with \u2018costs\u2019 that are not yet clear. We note a recent study has shown homeostatic IFN-\u03b2 and IFNAR signaling in the brain has an essential role in suppressing neurodegeneration [53]. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the hitherto unknown tissue-specific homeostatic roles of type I IFN signaling is warranted. During infection, although it would seem that upregulation of \u03b26 would only have a negative impact on the host by limiting the anti-viral response, it could also be important for balancing the inflammatory response by suppressing activated macrophages through a TGF-\u03b2-dependent process [2,5,15,45], initiating wound repair, or by recruiting macrophages to the site of infection. Attempts to address the role of TGF-\u03b2 in influenza pathogenesis by systemic inhibition resulted in lethal infection [54]. Thus, future studies will focus on inhibiting the \u03b26 integrin at different times post-infection to understand its precise role in viral infection and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

The \u03b1V\u03b26 integrin is expressed at low amounts in healthy adult tissue but is rapidly upregulated during development and in response to injury and inflammation [30]. Once expressed, \u03b26 activates latent TGF-\u03b21 by binding to the RGD motif in the latency-associated peptide (LAP) [10,55]. Upon activation, TGF-\u03b21 regulates a variety of genes associated with the immune response and pulmonary fibrosis and is thought to negatively restrict inflammation in macrophages through an unknown mechanism [45]. However, systemic inhibition of all TGF-\u03b2 isoforms by a broadly neutralizing antibody led to lethal influenza infection [54] suggesting that the role of TGF-\u03b2 during infection may be complex and depend on both the cellular milieu and TGF-\u03b2 isoform. Recent work has shown that the pulmonary microenvironment dictates the behavior of alveolar macrophages to a greater extent than the origin of the macrophages [42]. Based on our studies we propose that in the lung microenvironment, upregulation of the \u03b26 integrin leads to localized activation of TGF-\u03b21 that negatively regulates alveolar macrophages leading to decreased type I IFN activity in the microenvironment through an as yet undefined mechanism that will require further molecular investigation. An important extension of this model is that influenza viruses themselves activate latent TGF-\u03b2 during infection [56] and global inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 during infection is lethal, suggesting an important role in protection from influenza [54]. Therefore, it will be important to be able to experimentally segregate the host- versus virus-specific TGF-\u03b2 processing events in mice expressing or lacking \u03b26 integrin.",

While the \u03b26 integrin represents an attractive therapeutic target to combat pulmonary disease, it does play a role in lung homeostasis. While transient inhibition of \u03b26 in the lung results in resistance to infection, complete lack of \u03b26 function for long periods of time could be detrimental. Over long periods of time, \u03b26 KO mice over produce macrophage-derived matrix metalloprotease MMP12, leading to emphysema and destruction of pulmonary tissue [16]. However, for short-term protection against the adverse consequences of potentially lethal pulmonary viral infections, our work identifies the \u03b1V\u03b26 integrin as a potentially attractive therapeutic target for transient intervention in lung viral infection.",

The exact relationship between the suppression of type I signaling versus the production of type I IFNs through \u03b1V\u03b26 remains to be established.",
