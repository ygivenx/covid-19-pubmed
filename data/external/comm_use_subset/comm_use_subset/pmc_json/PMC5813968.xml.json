Besides being one of the most common diseases, it is a leading cause for health care use, and mortality, particularly due to the presence of pneumonia [3\u20135]. In the clinical practice, acute asthma exacerbations and pneumonia have an overlap of symptoms, and may also coexist, leading to misdiagnosis. For example over-diagnosis of pneumonia and under-diagnosis of asthma may contribute to significantly untreated respiratory morbidity and mortality in children less than five years old in low-income countries [6]. Both groups differ with respect to the associated virus and bacteria: while asthma exacerbations have been associated to a specific rhinovirus infection, pneumonia can be related to a wide range of bacterial, fungal and viral agents, with a high prevalence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) [2,7].",

Recent studies describe the community of microorganisms that reside in the respiratory tract, referred to also as the microbiome, by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), and in most cases by evaluating bacterial components based only for specific gene (16S) [9,10]. On the other hand, the Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) approach provides enough information to identify all viral and bacterial species not only for a specific gene [11]. While bacterial composition of the microbiome is called bacteriome, the virome (or viral metagenome) refers to the viral fraction comprising viruses responsible for acute, persistent, or latent infections, and viruses integrated into the host genome such as endogenous retroviruses [12].",

Libraries were labeled with Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina) according the S1 Table and pooled into one. The pooled library was loaded in a flow cell and sequencing was performed in a MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (Illumina) to obtain paired-end reads of 250 bp in length (2x250). An in-house pipeline was developed to perform the bioinformatics analysis for all files (Fig 1 step 3). Datasets of human, bacteria and virus sequences (downloaded from the NCBI FTP server in March 2015) were downloaded to build Smalt, BWA index, local BLASTN and BLASTX databases. All data from MiSeq instrument were trimmed through a Phred-like q20 < 20 using Fastqc software. Reads were aligned to databases described above using a standalone BLASTn for direct assignment of each read with an E-value of 1e-30. For viruses, Blastn with an E-value of 1e-30 and Blastx with an E-value of 1e-01, on trimmed reads and after human, bacterial and viral mapping, were used respectively.

Viruses found in these respiratory samples belonged to different families, mainly Picornaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. Members of the Anelloviridae family were found in both groups of pediatric patients; although members of this family are usually considered ubiquitous and benign, a potential role of TTMV in pneumonia pathogenesis has been suggested [24], Other studies have implicated TTV as contributing elements in lung impairment and it has been associated with asthma [25] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [26]. Even so, more studies are needed to elucidate the role of respiratory pathogenicity of the Torque teno viruses. EVD68 has been associated with asthma exacerbation and pneumonia in children [20], In this study, EV-D68 was detected in the 2014\u20132015 winter seasons, confirming the presence of this virus in Mexico City. With respect to CMV, some studies have found evidence of its implications in asthma pathogenesis and asthmatic inflammation [27]. InfA H1N1pdm09 was found in most of the studied groups, its participation and association with bacterial pneumonia [7] are well known, but a strong association with asthma exacerbation has been reported as well [28]. Among other of the found viruses, Adenovirus (AdV) has been associated with pneumonia [29], and BoV has been deemed as a cause of SARI in the absence of viral and bacterial co-infections [15]. Finally, Wiersbitzky et al. [30] suggested that PVB19 can cause acute respiratory diseases with obstructive ventilatory disturbances of the upper or lower airways in children with a specific endogenous predisposition. Other components detected in the viruses were bacteriophages, viruses commonly excluded in the final analysis of the viral community, Yet, these highly suggest the presence of their specific bacterial hosts in the sample.",

[16]), where greater diversity has been found. In our study, we detected 25 different species of viruses using this same strategy. This is most likely due to a greater ability of analyzing more samples in the same library, thereby increasing the probability to detect more viruses. In our study, we found the preferred virus associated with respiratory diseases, Rhinovirus, and consistent with others reports (Lysholm et.al. [31] and Wylie et.al. [12]), however in contrast with a report from Wang et.al. [16] that found a higher prevalence of RSV-B. Furthermore, few reports included healthy individuals as a control group (Wang et.al [16]), detecting lesser viral diversity with a high prevalence of viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae family. According to this report, the Torque teno virus and Torque teno mini virus that we found in children with asthma and pneumonia in our study, may be otherwise normal residents in children free of respiratory disease. Further data is lacking concerning the prevalence of viruses in the respiratory tracts of healthy children, which may be a limitation of our study.",

Interactions between invaders and host commensals may offer a better understanding about respiratory diseases [33]. Identifying coinfections between different microorganisms either between viruses or viruses and bacteria is essential in determining the etiology of the respiratory disease. Identifying the etiologic agents present on each disease may assist in developing better treatments and thereby improving patient care. Metagenomic and bioinformatic analyses are very powerful tools to describe the microbiome, which allow discerning the etiologic agents involved, and eventually may lead to the discovery of new respiratory viruses.",
