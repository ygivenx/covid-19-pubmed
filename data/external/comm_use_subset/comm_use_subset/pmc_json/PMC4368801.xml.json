            "text": "When an infectious disease outbreak occurs, public health officials need to understand the dynamics of disease transmission in order to launch an effective response. Two quantities that are often used to describe transmission are the basic reproductive number and the distribution of the serial interval (SI). The basic reproductive number (R0) is the average number of secondary cases a primary case will infect, assuming a completely susceptible population [1]. The reproductive number is always nonnegative; values less than one are indicative of an outbreak that will not continue to grow in the absence of imported cases. When R0 is larger than one, the magnitude of the value guides the types of control measures that are necessary to restrict transmission and control the outbreak. It is also essential to understand the timing between primary and secondary cases. For a given R0, if secondary cases occur shortly after the primary cases, a rapidly growing outbreak will result, which can be more difficult to control than an outbreak with a longer time interval between cases. The timing of the secondary cases is most easily measured by the SI distribution, an observable quantity. The SI is defined as the time between symptom onset in successive cases in a chain of backward transmission. The SI is used as a surrogate measure for the generation interval, which is unobservable, and is defined as the time between consecutive infections in the chain of transmission [2]. R0 and the SI distribution provide important information that is used to initiate an appropriate public health response to an infectious disease outbreak.",

Typically, the SI distribution is estimated using contact tracing or household data (see for example [4\u20135]); however, these studies are often small and subject to potential bias and errors in recall by participants. White and Pagano [6] introduced a novel approach to simultaneously estimate the R0 and the SI using only data from the epidemic curve. In recent years Bayesian methods have been developed to estimate transmission parameters, and can be particularly useful in instances with sparse data or when prior data about an outbreak exists; however these types of models have often been limited to Bayesian evidence synthesis or compartmental models [7\u201312]. Becker et al. [13] introduced a Bayesian framework to estimate R0 and the SI distribution by augmenting the likelihood function, introduced by White and Pagano, with independent observations of the SI from contact tracing data, and obtained posterior estimates through MCMC methods. They also made recommendations about the number of observations from the epidemic curve and contact tracing sample needed to obtain reliable estimates for R0 and the SI distribution.",

In the absence of prior information, we want to select hyperparameters for the Dirichlet prior such that the distribution will be noninformative [17\u201322]. We examined different priors such as Jeffrey\u2019s prior, which assigns 0.5 for all values of \u03b1i, and the Bayes-Laplace prior, which assigns 1 to all \u03b1i values. We found that using hyperparameters that are less than 1 can result in a lack of convergence or poor mixing. Because of this, when no additional information about the SI distribution is available, we select the Bayes-Laplace prior. This choice is not noninformative, as it imposes a uniform distribution on the prior, but it is reasonable for outbreaks where there are no contact tracing samples. This prior will be referred to as the uniform prior in the following sections.",

Our approach directly informs the SI prior distribution with the observed SIs, which enables us to guide the estimation of the SI by weighting each day of the SI according to the observed serial intervals.

We first include the uniform prior previously discussed (prior 1), which represents the situation when contact tracing data is not available and we only have daily incidence data (epidemic curve). Two informative prior distributions are also included, where the hyperparameters of the prior (observed SIs) match the SI distribution used to generate the data (Fig. 1). The first informative prior (prior 2) has 20 observed SIs, which corresponds to 40%, 10%, and 4% of the epidemic sizes listed above; the second (prior 3) includes only 10 observed SIs, which corresponds to 20%, 5%, 2% of the epidemic sizes. These priors (priors 2 and 3) are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d in our simulation because the distribution of SI observations matches the SI distribution used to generate the data. We also consider the situation when the contact tracing data used to inform the prior is biased, which is possible in a real life situation. The first misspecified prior (prior 4) is informed using an SI distribution that differs from the true distribution; however, the overall shape and mean of the SI distribution (\u03bc = 2.8) are very similar to the distribution used to generate the data. This scenario could occur when contact tracing data is included from another study of the same or similar pathogen. The second misspecified prior (prior 5) has a SI distribution that differs dramatically from the distribution used to generate the data, with a heavy tail and a prior mean of four (\u03bc = 4). Both priors 4 and 5 are composed of 20 observed SIs, which corresponds to 40%, 10% and 4% of the epidemic sizes.",

Careful thought should be given to the size of the prior relative to the total outbreak size and length. For smaller outbreaks it is especially important to make sure that the contact tracing sample size is not too large, which could potentially bias the estimates. If enough generations of transmission have been observed to properly estimate a SI of a given maximum length k, then the SI prior should be weighted to be no more 4% of the total outbreak size; however, a range of weights could be considered to examine the robustness of the results. When total outbreak lengths are limited, weighting the SI prior to be 1\u20132% of the total outbreak size may be more appropriate. If contact tracing data is not available then a range of possible models with reasonable choices of k should be considered. The choice of k can be determined by prior knowledge of similar outbreaks or general knowledge about the pathogen. Each model can be analyzed using a uniform prior distribution for the SI and the models can be compared using the DIC (or other model assessment tool). Smallest DICs indicate best fit, which can be used to narrow down the best model and value for k.

The posterior mean of \u03bc was almost identical to the prior mean, which indicates that a heavily weighted prior can bias the posterior results. For the SARS outbreak in Singapore and Hong Kong the contact tracing sample size was much larger relative to the number of cases in epidemic curve, which also impacted our results. Here, when we informed the SI prior distribution with contact tracing data, the posterior estimates of R0 and \u03bc decreased, and the posterior estimate of \u03bc was similar to the prior mean (mean of the contact tracing sample). This decrease in the estimates is likely related to the timing of the contact tracing sample collection and of the implementation of control measures, and is attributable to including a large contact tracing sample from a different phase of the outbreak. The results from the outbreak analyses support the work of Kenah et al. [32], in which they show that when the prevalence of an infection is lower, the serial interval should be larger.",

We recommend analyzing the data with and without the contact tracing sample to see if the final estimates differ substantially and not using a SI prior that is weighted to be more than 4% of the total outbreak size. In instances when there are substantial differences, we recommend critical examination of the techniques used to obtain the samples and consideration of the total outbreak size and length in order to evaluate potential explanations for the inconsistencies. Ideally, one would be able to determine if the data are in conflict, or if the differences are due to an improvement in estimation because more information is being incorporated.",

We demonstrated through simulation and in the analysis of H1N1 in South Africa and SARS in Hong Kong, that the DIC can be utilized to select the best model and value of k. We recommend that a set of plausible values of k be selected, and then model comparison be done with the DIC; smaller values of DIC indicate better fit.",

When outbreak sizes were small and reproductive numbers were large we observed short epidemic lengths, such as when N = 50 and R0 = 6 we only observe epidemic lengths of four to five days for an SI with maximum length five and saw that R^0 is underestimated. For simulations based on larger values of the reproductive number the results were varied; the best results were observed for large epidemic sizes. Outbreaks based on smaller reproductive numbers resulted in better posterior estimates regardless of outbreak size. Griffin et al. [33] notes that estimation is better when cases are spread over many generations, as opposed to having more individuals in fewer generations, as is likely to occur with a large reproductive number. We also observed that not only is the total number of observed cases important, but also when these cases appear [13]. The issues with estimating the parameters with the larger R0 could be resolved by allowing the epidemic curve to cover more generations of data (larger N). In fact, one is unlikely to begin such an analysis for outbreak that has only been occurring over so few days. Additional information about the reproductive number that could be used to inform its prior distribution could potentially improve this issue as well. However, in practice, these scenarios where the SI is relatively short and the reproductive number is large are uncommon.",

Our findings support those seen in Becker et al. [13], in which they conclude that having only 10 additional observations on the SI can substantially improve estimation. We also showed through simulation that our method is comparable to the Becker approach. When no contact tracing data is available the methods are mathematically equivalent, and when we incorporate observations on the SI the two approaches are very similar. The primary difference between the two methods is in how the contact tracing data is incorporated in the estimation process, and the method we propose provides a more general framework in allowing outside data sources and different prior weights to be utilized.",

One potential solution would be to modify the model to obtain time-updated estimates of the SI. This could be done in phases as prevalence of the disease changes. In addition, one could consider using a hazard-based estimator, as suggested in Kenah et al., or other likelihood based approach [32, 34].

[35], introduced an interval-censored approach that considers the time of symptom onset on the interval between consecutive days. We do not account for interval censoring in our analysis, which could lead to potential biases, particularly when the serial interval is short. An interesting extension of this work would be to use a continuous SI distribution, such as the gamma distribution shown in White and Pagano [6] or other smoothness assumption and estimate the serial interval using the approach in te Beest et al. [35]. The prior distributions for the parameters of the gamma distributed serial interval could then be informed from the SI estimate corrected for interval censoring. One could potentially further modify the likelihood function or overall model formulation to allow for interval-censoring to be directly incorporated in our estimation.",
