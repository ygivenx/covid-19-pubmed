            "text": "Rice viral diseases are major threats to rice production and have been distributed worldwide across regions depending on rice cultivation [1]. Two of the most prevalent rice viruses are RSV and RBSDV, which were transmitted by a small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus Fallen) [2\u20134]. When infected with RSV at the seedling stage, normally, rice plants grow poorly and often develop folded and twisted leaves, with the central leaves yellowing and withering; and plant growth may terminate and ultimately the plant will die [5\u20137]. In China, rice stripe is very serious, especially in Jiangsu province, where about 0.6 M ha per year of rice were infected by RSV during the period of 2000 to 2003, increasing to 1 M ha in 2004. In heavily infected fields, rice yield is reduced by 30\u201350 %, and in some of the most severely infected fields, no harvest is possible [8]. In RBSDV infected rice always develops stunted stems, dark green, twisted leaves, and white waxy swellings along veins on the abaxial surface of the leaves [3, 9, 10]. The disease caused severely damage on rice in most parts of eastern China with due to widespread release of susceptible cultivars. Since the infection damage was very severe in China and Southeast Asia, the understanding of the responses of rice to viral infection, especially gene expression analysis, is very important for developing strategies for disease control [8, 11].",

            "text": "The widely used method to measure transcript abundance is RT-qPCR compared to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and northern blot [12\u201314]. Besides being a powerful tool, RT-qPCR suffers from certain pitfalls, most important being the normalization with a reference gene [15\u201317]. In recent years, the reference genes, such as those encoding actin (Actin), tubulin (TUB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and 18S rRNA, are often separately chosen for the normalization in RT-qPCR because of their constant expression levels in living organisms [16]. Nevertheless, different studies sometimes proved different or even opposing results of these reference genes, and it was demonstrated that the transcript levels of these genes actually vary under different experimental conditions [18\u201321]. For example, different expression levels normalized by a different reference gene could be approximately 100 folds [22]. Furthermore, Myzus persicae\u2019s actin and GAPDH protein were found to interaction with Beet western yellows virus in vitro [23] and some A.pisumwere\u2019s genes (Actin and GAPDH) considered to be potentially related to the transmission of Peaenation mosaic virus and Soybean dwarf virus [24]. Thus, it is important and necessary to select suitable reference gene(s) for different experimental paradigms, particularly in RSV and RBSDV infection conditions which those appropriate internal reference(s) were not identified [25\u201327].",

It is advisable to add additional reference genes to the normalization factor until the added gene has no significant effect [28, 30].",

Interestingly, we found that the ranking generated by this approach (Fig. 5) was approximately similar with those determined by geNorm (Fig. 4a and b).

In RSV- and RBSDV-infected samples, UBQ 10 + GAPDH and UBC + Actin1 were used as multiple reference genes, respectively. Meanwhile, TIP41-Like was used as single reference gene in our experimental conditions. As expected, in comparison with single reference gene, the normalization of OsPR1b using UBQ 10 + GAPDH and UBC + Actin1, respectively, resulted in significant increase in transcript levels under virus infection conditions (Fig. 6a and b). The result was similar with previous studies [38, 39]. Meanwhile, the expression levels of OsWRKY were progressively increased in the early stage of infection and then decreased (Fig. 6c and d).

            "text": "To date, the commonly used methods to assess the stability of reference genes are geNorm [28], NormFinder [29] and BestKeeper [40]. As BestKeeper cannot test more than 10 candidates, it was not used in this study. By using geNorm and NormFinder, algorithms, 14 reference genes (Table 1) were evaluated. Our findings revealed that UBQ 10 and GAPDH were overall the most stable genes in RSV-infected rice (Figs. 4a and 5a), and Actin1 and UBC ranked the best candidate genes under RBSDV infection (Figs. 4b and 5b). Interestingly, the suitable reference genes for RSV- and RBSDV-infected rice plants were different, it is indicated that the expression of the reference genes can vary under given situations [21]. Therefore, it is vital to choose suitable reference gene(s) for normalization of gene expression. Moreno et al. [41] showed that in different Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV)-infected tissues, PP2A, UBQ10 and GTPb appeared to be the most stable genes. In infected tomato plants, GAPDH and UBQ indicated as the most appropriate internal standards both in leaves and root tissues, and Actin was also stably expressed in the infected plants [42]. When infected with four commonly known tomato viral pathogens, ACT, CAC and EF1-\u03b1 were considered as the most suitable reference genes in the studies of host\u2013virus interactions [43]. Therefore, the selected multiple reference genes (UBQ 10 + GAPDH for RSV, and UBC + Actin1 for RBSDV) could be used for the normalization of gene expression pattern in RSV- and RBSDV-infected rice plants.",

Previous results showed that EF1-\u03b1 was expressed stably in potato during biotic and abiotic stress [44], and 18S rRNA was identified to be suitable for normalisation in Barley yellow dwarf virus-infected cereals [45]. In our study, the performance of above two genes was dissatisfactory. These were similar to the earlier studies in Cicer arietinum and virus-infected tomato, showing the considerable alterations in the transcript levels of EF1-\u03b1 and 18S rRNA [42, 46]. Thus, the two traditional reference genes might not be the optimal choices for quantitating transcript level in rice during RSV- and RBSDV-infection. Meanwhile, TUB was widely used as reference gene for gene expression analysis. However, due to the potential regulation in various physiological states, the suitability as internal control has been questioned [45, 47]. In our experimental conditions, \u03b1-TUB and \u03b2-TUB (in particularly) were not stable either, especially in RBSDV-infected plants. Taken together, our data demonstrated that \u03b1-TUB and \u03b2-TUB were unsuitable for the normalization of gene expression levels in viral infected rice.",

Our results further showed that when using TIP41-Like gene for normalization, the induction patterns of OsPR1b and OsWRKY transcripts were not stronger than those using two reference genes (Fig. 6). Thus, the application of multiple reference genes is a better choice for gene expression analysis under virus infection situation.",

Expression levels were assessed based on the number of amplification cycles needed to reach a specific threshold (cycle threshold; Ct) in the exponential phase of RT-qPCR. For both programs, raw Ct values of each gene were converted into relative quantities before inputting into software. The relative expression levels of corresponding genes were calculated relative to the maximum abundance in different samples. The highest relative expression for each gene was set to 1.0. The geNorm algorithm [28] derives a stability measure (M). Via a stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene, it creates a stability ranking. It also estimates the number of genes required to calculate a robust normalization factors, and performs a stepwise analysis (more stable to less stable genes) to calculate the pairwise variation (Vn/n+1) between two sequential normalization factors containing an increasing number of genes. NormFinder algorithm [29] used an ANOVA-based model to estimate intra- and inter-group variation. It combines these results to provide a direct measurement of the variation in the expression for each gene [52]. Statistical significance of Ct differences between treatments was calculated by the Mann\u2013Whitney t test using the GraphPad Prism 5 software.",
