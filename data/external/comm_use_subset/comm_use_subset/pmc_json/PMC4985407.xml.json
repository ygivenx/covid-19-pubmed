The total population for each year was obtained from the Department of Statistics in the Ministry of the Interior of Executive Yuan in Taiwan. The age-adjusted incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was age-adjusted to the World population in 2000. We tested for temporal trends in ARDS incidence by Poisson regression analysis. Differences in demographic characteristics, clinical features, and resource utilization of patients by survival status were tested with Student t test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and the \u03c72 test for categorical variables. We also reported in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality across each calendar year, and the temporal trend was tested by the Cochran\u2013Armitage trend test.

Several previous studies have used the ICD-9 coding system to investigate the incidence and outcomes of ARDS. Reynolds et al23 reported that the estimated incidence of ARDS in Maryland was in the range of 10 to 14 cases per 100,000 people and the mortality rate was 36% to 52%, using ICD-9 codes 518.5 and 518.82.23 Other studies have also used the ICD-9 coding system to determine the incidence or prevalence of ARDS in particular populations, such as those with traumatic brain injury,24 spinal cord injury,25 and subarachnoid hemorrhage.26 Because the ICD-9 coding system is linked to the Taiwanese healthcare reimbursement system, the accuracy of ICD-9 coding is quite precise. Indeed, more than 1000 studies using the Taiwan NHIRD have been published, including a number of important epidemiologic observations.27\u201331 In the case of ARDS, the specificity of ICD-9 coding is likely improved by the fact that the diagnosis is typically made only by intensivists or pulmonologists. We, however, acknowledge that reliance on ICD-9 coding to identify patients with ARDS likely underestimates the true incidence of ARDS, especially with regard to mild or moderate ARDS. This may explain why the observed incidence of ARDS in this study is lower than that reported by Rubenfeld et al4 in a study that used prospective ARDS phenotyping by trained investigators.",

One possibility is that use of ICD-9 coding identifies a more severely ill group of patients than other methods of ARDS phenotyping. The in-hospital mortality rate in 2011 (47%) in the current study is very close to the mortality reported for patients with severe ARDS in the report of the Berlin Definition of ARDS, (45%),4 which accounted for approximately one-third of the total study participants in the Berlin study.32,33 One possible interpretation is that the Taiwanese study population is representative of severe ARDS and that ICD-9 coding missed many of the less severe mild and moderate cases. If this were the case, then the calculated incidence of all ARDS in Taiwan might be closer to 60 per 100,000 person-years, which is close to the recent report in the United States.4 In support of this estimate, Moss et al used multiple-cause mortality data to analyze the incidence of ARDS in a population that was more likely to be in the severe stage of the disease. That study showed that the incidence of ARDS was 17 to 26 per 100,000 person-years,34 which is very close to our finding. Another potential explanation for the high mortality in the Taiwanese cohort is that factors related to health care delivery or patient race lead to the differences in observed outcomes.",
