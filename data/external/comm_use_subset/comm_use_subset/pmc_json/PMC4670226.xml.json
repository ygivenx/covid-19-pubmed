The entry step involves fusion of the viral and the cellular receptor membranes, which is mediated by the viral envelope (E) proteins. There are three classes of envelope proteins [2]: Class I E proteins include influenza virus (IFV) hemagglutinin and retrovirus Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) gp41; Class II E proteins include a number of important human flavivirus pathogens such as Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Togaviridae virus such as alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV); Class III E proteins include vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Although the exact fusion mechanism remains elusive and the three classes of viral fusion proteins exhibit distinct structural folds, they may share a similar mechanism of membrane fusion [3].",

Enfuvirtide (T20), a peptide that mimicks the HR2 region of Class I HIV-1 gp41, is the first FDA-approved HIV-1 fusion drug that inhibits the entry process of virus infection [5\u20137]. Then peptides mimicking extended regions of the HIV-1 gp41 were also demonstrated as effective entry inhibitors [8, 9]. Furthermore, peptides derived from a distinct region of GB virus C E2 protein were found to interfere with the very early events of the HIV-1 replication cycle [10]. Other successful examples of Class I peptide inhibitors include peptide inhibitors derived from SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein [11\u201313] and from Pichinde virus (PICV) envelope protein [14]. Recently, a peptide derived from the fusion initiation region of the glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) in IFV, Flufirvitide-3 (FF-3) has progressed into clinical trial [15].",

            "text": "Computational informatics plays an important role in predicting the activities of the peptides generated from combinatorial libraries. In silico methods such as data mining, generic algorithm and vector-like analysis were reported to predict the antimicrobial activities of peptides [33\u201335]. In addition, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) [36\u201340] and artificial neural networks (ANN) were applied to predict the activities of peptides [41, 42]. Recently, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed to predict the antivirus activities using the physicochemical properties of general antiviral peptides [43]. However, the mechanism of action of antiviral peptides is different from antimicrobial peptides; in fact, various protein targets are involved in the virus infection. e.g. HIV-1 virus infection involves virus fusion, integration, reverse transcription and maturation, etc. Thus it is difficult to retrieve the common features from general antiviral peptides to represent their antiviral activities. Virus fusion is mediated by E proteins. Although E proteins are highly divergent in sequence and structure, they share a common pathway of membrane fusion dynamics. i.e. E proteins experience significant conformational change to form a-trimer-of-hairpin, which drives the fusion of viral membrane and host membrane [44]. The antiviral peptides derived from enveloped proteins function by in situ binding to their respective accessory proteins, disrupting forming of the trimer-of-hairpin and membrane fusion, and therefore inhibiting the virus infection. In view of the important role of E proteins in virus fusion process and common mechanism of action of self-derived peptides, we developed a SVM model to predict the antiviral activities of self-derived peptides using sequence-based statistical scores as input features. The sequence-based properties were calculated by a conditional probability discriminatory function which indicates the propensity of each amino acid for being active at a specific position. Our model exhibited remarkably higher accuracy in predicting the activities of self-derived peptides, compared to the previous models developed for general antiviral peptides using classical physicochemical properties as descriptors [43]. The method would be useful in identification of entry inhibitors as a new generation of antiviral therapies.",

RAPDF is a structure-based statistical scoring function. It is based on the assumption that averaging over different atom types in experimental conformations is an adequate representation of the random arrangements of these atom types in any compact conformation. Here we developed a sequence-based statistical scoring function, where we presume that averaging over different amino acid sequences with experimental validated inhibitive activities is an adequate representation of the random amino acid sequences with any inhibitory activity. The basis of this assumption is that the peptides share a common mechanism of action, i.e. the peptides derived from E proteins bind competitively to their partner proteins, disrupt the forming of a-trimer-of-hairpin, and therefore inhibit the virus membrane fusion.",

Because the three classes of E proteins have different structural folds, it is difficult to retrieve a structure-based feature that is relevant to their antiviral activities. Generally speaking, any property associated with folded proteins can be converted into an energy function [56]. Since amino acid sequence determines the structural folds and properties of proteins/peptides, we presumed that a sequence-based statistical scoring function averaging over different amino acid sequences exhibiting inhibitive activities is an adequate representation of the random combinations of all twenty amino acid exhibiting any activity. In this approach, a peptide sequence derived from E protein is represented by twenty features each corresponding to the propensity of observing each of the twenty natural amino acids to be either active or non-active.

Actually the majority of known peptide entry inhibitors share a common physicochemical property of being hydrophobic and amphipathic with a propensity for binding to lipid membranes [58]. Therefore, here the properties of E peptide inhibitors were described by five physicochemical parameters: PI, MW, GRAVY index (positive and negative GRAVY values indicate hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides, respectively), solvent accessibility (exposed or buried) and secondary structure features (propensity for adopting \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet or turn structure).

The peptide inhibitors employed in AVPpred target a variety of biological targets involved in virus infection. In contrast, the self-derived peptides of enveloped proteins being studied in the present research competitively bind to E proteins so as to mediate the virus fusion process. Because the self-derived peptides share similar mechanism of action, it is feasible to retrieve common features from them to build predictive SVM models. In order to evaluate the performance in predicting peptide inhibitors of the enveloped virus, we compared the AVPpred models with our EAPpred models using an independent 26p+26n dataset as test set. The results are shown in Table 3.",

When the AVPmotif model was used to predict the activities of the self-derived peptide inhibitors, it performed rather poorly with accuracy of 52% and MCC of 0.14. This is not surprising because AVPmotif was developed based on 20 general antiviral peptide motifs. However, the self-derived peptide inhibitors may not share a conserved motif with the general antiviral peptides since the latter interact with various biological targets with different mechanisms of action. In the AVPalign model, the peptide sequences were classified into active and non-active databases and the query peptide sequences were matched against the active and non-active databases using the BLAST program. Compared with AVPcompo and AVPphysico, AVPalign performed better with a predictive accuracy of 73% and MCC value of 0.52. Fusion mechanism is highly conserved among related viruses and entry of viruses into host cells has been inhibited by peptides derived from various regions of envelope glycoproteins [59]. Self-derived peptides would inhibit interactions of their original domain by mimicking its mode of binding to partner proteins [4]. Because similar sequences are often associated with similar structure and function, the sequence-based property AVPalign would account for the activities of the self-derived peptide inhibitors which regulate the virus fusion by mimicking the binding to E proteins.",

Therefore we only employed five physicochemical properties reflecting hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility and secondary structure features as SVM input features.

            "text": "The MCC value of the AVPcompo models is 0.20, indicating that the antiviral activities of the peptides are related to amino acid composition. When the amino acid composition was used as input, the predictive accuracy of the EAPcompo model was higher than that of the AVPcompo model, indicating the peptide inhibitors of E proteins employed in the training set is sufficient to represent the contribution of amino acid composition to their inhibitive activities. In the EAPcompo model, the preference of the amino acid composition was ranked as: P, R, Q, D, F, W, E, L, T, I, N, H, Y, C, A, S, M, V, K, G (Fig 1). The role of arginine-arginine pairing and its contribution to protein-protein interactions has been investigated by computational approaches [61]. The higher abundance of R at protein-protein interfaces compared to K may be attributed to the formation of cation-\u03c0-interactions and the greater capacity of the guanidinium group in R to form hydrogen bonds (compared to K) [62\u201364]. Furthermore, it was suggested that the interface regions are enriched in aliphatic (L, V, I, M) and aromatic (H, F, Y, W) residues and depleted in charged residues (D, E, K) with the exception of arginine [62, 65\u201369]. This is in agreement with our amino acid composition analysis, where higher population of aliphatic Leu residue as well as aromatic residues Trp and Phe was observed, whereas positively charged Lys was hardly observed. The predominant occurrence of proline and glutamine residues is characteristic for the unique protein-protein interactions for E proteins. e.g. a conserved proline-rich motif was suggested to be engaged in monomer-monomer interactions in Dengue E proteins [70]. A conserved glutamine-rich layer is involved in the extensive H-bond network in HIV-1 gp41 E proteins [71]. Thus the preference of the amino acid composition identified from the EAPcompo model is generally in accordance with the predominant residues involved in protein-protein interactions, manifesting the amino acid composition of the self- derived peptide inhibitors are closely related to their potential activities in mediating the protein-protein interactions in the virus fusion process.",

The logarithm form of the discriminatory function (Eq 1) can be deemed as the pseudo energy of the system. In our previous study, we suggested that the stability of proteins is related to their in situ binding potential to the partner regions [72].

The AVPcompo and EAPcompo models demonstrated that the activities of antiviral peptides are dependent on amino acid composition. A sequence-based scoring function was developed for the self-derived peptide inhibitors of E proteins. The outperformance of the EAPscoring models supports our hypothesis that an intrinsic feature, represented by the propensity of each amino acid for being active in self-derived peptides, is responsible for the activities of the peptides to regulate virus fusion by mimicking the binding to their accessory proteins.
