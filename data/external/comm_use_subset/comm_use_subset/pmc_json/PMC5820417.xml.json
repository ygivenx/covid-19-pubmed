Pneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis in HBoV\u2010positive patients (96.2%) and HMPV\u2010positive patients (98.5%) with LRTIs, which is in agreement with previous reports,12, 13, 14, 15 Calvo reported that HMPV\u2010positive patients were younger than HBoV\u2010positive patients; in contrast, the ages of HBoV\u2010 and HMPV\u2010positive patients did not differ significantly in our study. HMPV and HBoV frequently resulted in hospitalization,8, 16 which has been reflected in our results.

This is not in agreement with the study by Calvo, in which hospitalization duration was longer in patients with HMPV. However, our data are in line with the findings of Davis.8 Our findings suggest that more attention should be paid to young children with LRTIs due to the considerable hospitalization duration. In our study, HBoV and HMPV infections were almost completely confined to infants and children; 63.9% (168/263) of HBoV patients and 61.8% (123/199) of HMPV patients were hospitalized during their first year of life, in agreement with the study by Edwards.17 This is likely due to the weak immunity of children aged <1 year.",

On the other hand, it is possible that the detection rate differs geographically. RSV was the most frequently virus detected in patients with respiratory infections, followed by PIV3, HBoV, ADV, and HMPV. Our data support previous reports of RSV, PIV3, HBoV, ADV, and HMPV as the major agents associated with LRTIs among children in a hospital setting.12, 19, 20, 21, 22 The HBoV infection rate (24.1%) in the present study is consistent with earlier reports (1.9%\u201024.6%8, 9, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26), and the incidence of HMPV (18.2%) in patients with respiratory tract infections is similar to that in other regions (1.5%\u201018%2, 9, 17, 23, 26, 27, 28). Therefore, HMPV and HBoV are major causes of LRTIs worldwide.",

The HBoV\u2010positive patients had a shorter hospitalization duration than HBoV\u2010negative patients (P = .021). In contrast, Deng reported that HBoV\u2010positive patients had a longer hospitalization duration. The longer hospitalization duration of HBoV\u2010negative patients in our study may have been caused by the presence of other viruses (such as RSV and PIV3) in many of them. Also, hospitalization duration was significantly associated with age (\u22646 months), maternal smoking during pregnancy, and a family history of asthma.19 A high HMPV viral load contributes to development of fever.4, 5 Indeed, HMPV\u2010positive patients had a higher incidence of fever than HMPV\u2010negative patients (P = .002) in our study.",

In contrast, Jiang reported that coinfections were significantly more frequent among patients with a low than a high viral load. Previous studies15, 26 reported no difference in the clinical manifestations of children with single and multiple infections. In our study, patients infected with HBoV only were older (26.05 \u00b1 31.22 months) than those infected with HBoV and other respiratory viruses (15.89 \u00b1 18.94 months) (P = .005). Analyzing the correlation between viral load and coinfections is problematic because viral load can change rapidly over the disease course; this might explain the conflicting results among studies.
