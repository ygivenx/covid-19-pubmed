We have previously shown that murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection triggers accumulation and persistence of B-lineage cells within the brain, which produce Abs and play a significant role in controlling reactivated virus [7]. While the involvement of chemokines and survival factors in B cell migration and differentiation in lymphoid organs is well-documented, little is known about the glial cell-produced factors which are involved in the recruitment, retention, and long-term survival of these lymphocytes within the brain.",

            "text": "Our previous studies have extensively characterized cytomegalovirus neurotropism both in vitro and in vivo, reviewed in Cheeran et al. [8]. Using primary cell culture systems or brain-derived cell lines, it has been shown that practically all cell types within the brain have some degree of susceptibility to CMV infection. However, these different cell types vary in their ability to support a complete viral replication cycle, which in turn is largely controlled by the transcription factor milieu within the cell during infection. In both mice and humans, cultured primary astrocytes support productive CMV infection with a 3 log10 unit increase in viral titers over a course of 5 days. These cells also respond to the virus by producing immune mediators. In contrast to astrocytes, primary differentiated neurons and primary microglial cells are much more refractory to productive CMV replication. Although nonproductively infected, microglial cells are stimulated by viral antigens to produce immune mediators. It is important to distinguish between productive viral infection of glial cells and their innate stimulation by viral antigens through pattern recognition receptors or immune factors. Our previous in vivo studies have shown that subsequent to intracerebroventricular (icv) infection with MCMV, in immunocompetent animals, viral brain infection is localized primarily to cells that line the periventricular region. These periventricular target cells were subsequently identified as nestin-positive, neural stem cells [9]. Infection spreads to astrocytes within the brain parenchyma only in the absence of an effective CD8+ T cell response [10]. Reports by other groups have also established the importance of CD8+ T cells for control of primary infection [11, 12]. Likewise, previous studies from our laboratory have shown that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells persist within the brain even in the absence of detectable viral protein [13]. Establishment of latency after clearance of acute infection and the potential to reactivate to recurrent infection are key features of all herpesvirus, including MCMV [14].",

            "text": "During normal development of high-affinity Ab-secreting cells, germinal center plasma blasts give rise to long-lived plasma cells which reside primarily in the bone marrow. The bone marrow niche provides factors necessary to support long-term survival of these cells in order to maintain serum Ab levels and protect against re-infection [15, 16]. Because passage of Abs from serum into the brain through an intact blood\u2013brain barrier is inefficient, local Ab secretion by cells which have infiltrated the brain appears to be a more effective strategy for viral control. Cells of the B-lineage enter the CNS in response to acute viral infection, and like T cells, they are retained within the brain into the chronic phase. Although CD8+ T cells play a critical role in controlling viral spread during acute brain infection [10, 11], prolonged immune responses within the brain following MCMV infection are characterized by persistence of Ab-producing B cells, chronic microglial cell activation, and retention of virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells [7, 13]. Like other herpesviruses, MCMV establishes latency after control of acute infection and clearance of detectable viral antigen. We have previously found that Abs produced within the CNS play a significant role in controlling MCMV reactivation from the latent state [7].",

The chemokine receptor CXCR5 (and its ligand CXCL13), as well as CCR7 (and its ligands CCL19 and CCL21), has been shown to play important roles in trafficking of B cells to lymphoid follicles in the development of germinal centers. Specifically within the CNS, during multiple sclerosis, but not viral infection, CXCL13 has been associated with formation of ectopic follicle-like structures and recapitulation of all stages of B cell differentiation observed in secondary lymphoid organs [18, 19]. It has also been shown to be a major chemokine receptor for B cell recruitment to the CNS during several neuroinflammatory diseases in patients [20]. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is normally absent on na\u00efve B cells, but it is upregulated during differentiation into memory and plasma cell precursors [21]. Furthermore, in knockout animals, the absence of CXCR3 has been demonstrated to impair recruitment of Ab-secreting cells into the CNS in a glia-tropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM model [22]. Using a Sindbis virus infection model, CCR5 was detected on 42 % of CD19+ B cells within the infected CNS, suggesting this receptor may also have recruiting functions [23].",

For Ab staining, the brain leukocytes were first treated with Fc block (anti-CD32/CD16 in the form of 2.4G2 hybridoma culture supernatant with 2 % normal rat and 2 % normal mouse serum) to inhibit nonspecific Ab binding and were stained with anti-mouse cell surface markers for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C (anti-CD45-PE-Cy5, anti-CD11b-AF700, anti-CD19-FITC, anti-Ki67-APC, and anti-CD267(TACI)-PE (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA); and anti-CD269(BCMA)-FITC (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)). Analysis by flow cytometry was performed. Control isotype Abs were used for all fluorochrome combinations to assess nonspecific Ab binding. Live leukocytes were gated using forward scatter and side scatter parameters on a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, Ashland, OR).",

In this study, multi-color flow cytometry was used to investigate the recruitment, persistence, and survival of this leukocyte population. Data generated from these experiments showed that CD19+ B cells entered the brain early during the course of infection (i.e., by 7 days post infection) and persisted through at least 60 days post infection, the latest time point tested. At 60 days post infection, 13.46 % of the CD45hiCD11blo leukocytes isolated from the infected brains were CD19+ (Fig. 1a). The absolute number of CD19+ cells was calculated from the flow cytometry data (Fig. 1b). Results presented in this study were obtained using MCMV infection of C57BL/6 mice, which differs from MCMV infection of the BALB/c animals used in our previous study [30]. We have directly compared the B cell brain infiltration and retention kinetics between these mouse strains. In these studies, the MCMV-infected BALB/c mice had higher, increasing levels of CNS B cells over the time course of infection. In contrast, the C57BL/6 animals had lower, decreasing CNS B cell levels. The results from these experiments showed 2.5 \u00d7 105 CD19+ B cells within the brain of the BALB/c animals at 30 days post infection, which is the same level as reported in Mutnal et al. [30]. In contrast, in the present study, we found 2.8 \u00d7 104 CD19+ B cells within the brains of the C57BL/6 animals at 30 days post infection (Fig. 1b). We do not yet know why these differences exist between the two mouse strains, but MCMV infection is clearly much more robust in the BALB/c animals. It is important to point out that the efficiency of lymphocyte extraction from all tissues, including the brain, for flow cytometry may be considerably less than 100 % [31].",

All of these known B cell chemokine receptors were detected on CD19+ cells isolated from the brain during MCMV infection (Fig. 2a). In particular, CXCR3 was found to be elevated on an increasing number of cells over the time course of infection and it was the primary chemokine receptor expressed at 60 days post infection (Fig. 2b). Quite different expression kinetics were observed for CXCR5, CCR5, and CCR7, which were elevated on the highest number of cells early during infection and decreased by 14, 30, and 60 days post infection (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that the CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9 and CXCL10) may be major contributors to B cell recruitment and persistence within the brain following MCMV infection. However, the expression level of a particular chemokine receptor alone may not be a good indicator of its importance in migration, as other factors such as chemokine levels and ligand affinities are also involved. However, CXCR3 was the only chemokine receptor which was found on an increasing proportion of B cells as time p.i. progressed (Fig. 2b). In addition to triggering cell migration into the brain, CXCR3 expression may provide additional B cell maturation and survival functions [32], which may become more apparent at the later time points as infection progresses.",

In these experiments, differential production of CXCL9/CXCL10 and CXCL13 by stimulated glial cells activated in response to MCMV infection was apparent. Microglial cells were found to produce high levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in response to viral infection, while infected astrocyte cultures produced markedly lower levels (Fig. 5).

We first determined that B cells obtained from MCMV-primed mice were competent to move towards the recombinant chemokines CXCL9 (100 ng/ml), CXCL10 (100 ng/ml), and CXCL13 (300 ng/ml) (Fig. 6a and b). Interestingly, no significant B cell migration to recombinant CCL3, CCL5, or CCL19 (each at 100 ng/ml) was observed (Fig. 6a and b). A dose\u2013response study demonstrated that these B cells were competent to move towards high concentrations (i.e., 100 and 300 ng/ml) of recombinant CXCL13 (Fig. 6c). We next assessed the ability of B lymphocytes to migrate towards supernatants obtained from stimulated or MCMV-infected microglial cell and astrocyte cultures placed in the lower wells of a chemotaxis chamber. Significant migration of B cells towards interferon (IFN)-\u03b3-stimulated astrocyte supernatants was seen (Fig. 6d). In addition, B cells were found to move towards supernatants from MCMV-infected microglial cells, but not astrocytes (Fig. 6d). Pretreatment of the infected microglial cell supernatants with neutralizing Abs to CXCL9 and CXCL10 significantly blocked B cell migration (Fig. 6e). Neutralizing Abs to the ligand of CXCR5 (i.e., CXCL13) did not significantly block chemotaxis. The results indicated that, although these B cells were competent to move towards high concentrations of recombinant CXCL13, their migratory response to supernatants from infected microglia was primarily mediated through CXCR3 (Fig. 6e).",

Therefore, long-term maintenance of this population in the CNS also suggests the presence of these survival factors [6, 34]. We have previously reported the presence of BAFF and APRIL mRNA expression within MCMV-infected brains [7]. To determine whether B cells within the CNS were proliferating, we examined these cells for the presence of Ki67, which is present in the nuclei of proliferating or recently proliferated cells, but not in quiescent cells. Results from these studies showed that B cells within the infected brains demonstrated proliferation at early time points (14.4 %, 7 increasing proportion of B cells as time), as well as sustained proliferation persisting through the latest time point tested (21.9 %, 60 increasing proportion of B cells as time) (Fig. 7a). We confirmed the upregulation of BAFF mRNA expression within the brains of MCMV-infected mice (Fig. 7b). In addition, dual-immunofluorescence staining for BAFF protein (CD257) and GFAP demonstrated that astrocytes were a source of BAFF within the CNS at 30 increasing proportion of B cells as time (Fig. 7c). We went on to examine BAFF receptor (BAFFR) expression on CD19+ B cells within the infected brains by gating on the CD45hiCD11bloCD19+ population of infiltrating leukocytes followed by analysis at 7, 14, 30, and 60 increasing proportion of B cells as time (Fig. 7d). The data obtained by flow cytometry were then used to calculate the total number of brain-infiltrating B cells expressing BAFFR at each time point p.i. (Fig. 7e). Additional flow cytometry experiments were performed to assess transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on brain-infiltrating B cells at both early (7 increasing proportion of B cells as time) and late (60 increasing proportion of B cells as time) time points post-infection (Fig. 7f).",

BAFF was found to be primarily produced by IFN-\u03b3-stimulated astrocytes, with much lower production by microglial cells. We then isolated B cells from MCMV-primed \u03b2-actin promoter-luciferase transgenic mice (7 days post-priming) and added these cells to primary murine astrocyte cultures. Because \u03b2-actin promoter-luciferase transgenic mice ubiquitously express the luciferase enzyme, reduced luciferin intensity, as assessed using relative light units (RLU), was indicative of cellular toxicity. When co-cultured with astrocytes at a ratio of 10:1, luciferase-expressing B cells demonstrated prolonged survival over the 7-day time course when compared to CD19+ cells cultured alone (Fig. 8b). In addition, when the co-cultured cells were analyzed using flow cytometry, the CD19-gated population displayed enhanced proliferation over B cells without astrocytes (28.8 versus 4.55 % following 4 days of co-culture), as indicated through staining for Ki67 (Fig. 8c). When conditioned media from astrocyte cultures was used alone (i.e., no co-culture), 7.9 % of the B lymphocytes were found to proliferate at 1 day and 1.3 % were Ki67 positive at 4 days. These results indicate that astrocytes promote proliferation of B lymphocytes through a mechanism requiring cell-to-cell contact. However, clearly, astrocytes are not the only cell type which can enhance B cell survival and their survival is likely not dependent on the presence of BAFF.",

Our previous study demonstrated that CD19+ B cells which had undergone further differentiation into CD19\u2212CD38+CD138+ plasma cells were present within the brain along with CD19+ B cells.

The IFN-\u03b3-inducible CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 have previously been reported to mediate plasma blast migration in vitro [35]. Additionally, within the CNS, CXCR3-dependent plasma blast migration into the murine spinal cord during neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis has also been reported [22]. The results presented here demonstrate that the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 were produced in response to viral infection of microglial cells, but not in response to viral infection of primary astrocytes. Likewise, B cells moved towards supernatants from MCMV-infected microglia cells, but not towards those obtained from MCMV-infected astrocytes. However, astrocytes were shown to be competent to produce these chemokines in response to stimulation with select pro-inflammatory cytokines. Previous studies investigating IFN-\u03b3-induced CXCL9 expression in astrocytes have produced variable results. Myeloid transcription factor PU.1-mediated IFN-\u03b3 induction of CXCL9 has been reported to be limited to murine microglial cells and not astrocytes [36]. However, IFN-\u03b3 has also been reported to induce this chemokine in primary human astrocytes [37]. Differences in cell culture conditions may play a role. It appears that the cellular source of CXCL10 production depends on both viral tropism and the cytokine milieu present within the infected brain. It is likely that cytokines produced during T cell infiltration into the brain (e.g., IFN-\u03b3 expression) activate astrocytes to produce chemokines which then drive subsequent infiltration of B cells. This idea would be consistent with our previous detection of IL-21 mRNA within MCMV-infected brains at 7, but not 30, increasing proportion of B cells as time [7].",

Using ELISA, we found elevated levels of CXCL13 within the brains of the MCMV-infected animals at 7 increasing proportion of B cells as time, but pretreatment of microglial cell supernatants with anti-CXCL13 Abs did not inhibit the migration of CD19+ B cells. Likewise, using knockout animals, CXCL13 has been reported to be dispensable for the initial recruitment of B cells to CNS inflammation induced by either Sindbis virus infection or experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [38]. Taken together, despite its importance in peripheral lymphoid tissue, it appears that CXCL13 may not be critical for B cell recruitment into the inflamed brain.",

The proliferation of B cells in response to viral CNS infection has been reported in other models, as detected by Ki67 staining in Sindbis virus-infected mice [23]. Unlike the situation reported in multiple sclerosis [19, 43, 44], in this study, we did not observe ectopic lymphoid follicle-like structures within the infected brains. They were also not observed in the Sindbis virus model, so it is possible that they are not a consequence of viral encephalitis. Additionally, in vitro data show that astrocytes support B cell proliferation and survival when they are co-cultured at a 10:1 (B cell to astrocyte) ratio. Interestingly, astrocytes were shown to express BAFF (CD257), and brain-infiltrating B cells were shown to expresses BAFFR. Additionally, expression of TACI (CD267) was detected on 11.2 % of the brain-infiltrating B cells at 60 increasing proportion of B cells as time, along with low levels of BCMA (CD269). Like BAFFR, both of these receptors have been shown to bind BAFF and promote survival of B cell populations [45\u201347]. Finally, conditioned media from the astrocyte cultures alone did not potentiate B cell proliferation, indicating that B cells require cell-to-cell contact with astrocytes to maximize their proliferation.",
