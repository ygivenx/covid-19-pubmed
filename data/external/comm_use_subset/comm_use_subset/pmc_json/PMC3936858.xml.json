Each province has similar and unique public health contexts. For example, in BC, public health is funded by the provincial government and delivered by five regional health authorities and one provincial health authority while in Ontario funding is shared between the provincial government and municipal (local) governments and delivered by 36 local boards of health. In addition, in both provinces some provincial agencies participate in delivery of some services. See Table 1 for additional information on BC and ON public health context.",

The types of documents included: provincial annual reports, core public health function/standards documents, commission reports on SARS, health human resources (HHR) and PHHR specific reports, health profession legislation, and other public health (PH) reports such as competencies development and leadership frameworks. Documents published between 2003 (beginning at the time of the SARS event) and March, 2011 were included in the analysis. Publicly available and internal provincial government and public health-related policy documents were obtained for BC (n = 27) and ON (n = 20). A small number of government documents were not publicly available but were identified as relevant to the analysis by our government team members. Relevant text from these documents was excerpted to include in the analysis while ensuring the confidentiality of documents was not compromised. While we made every effort to identify and access all relevant documents, some older documents many not have been available to the authors.

Both these documents provide conceptual frameworks describing HHR and PHHR planning. Broad categories relevant to PHHR and based on the national HHR documents were identified: background/context, responsibility/accountability for HHR planning, collaborations/partnerships, policy assumptions, HHR planning activities/elements, and HHR management. Within the broad categories, several sub-categories were developed to capture more specific detail. For example, for the category HHR planning activities/elements, sub-categories included: supply/HHR characteristics, deployment/utilization, leadership, education/training/competencies, capacity, and matching HHR to health/service requirements. For each sub category, a definition was developed to assist with consistent coding (see Additional file 2 for the coding template). Consensus on the coding categories, sub-categories and definitions was achieved with team members. A deductive content analysis was conducted using accepted methods [21] to compare key aspects of PHHR policy, planning and management including policy assumptions, collaborations, scope of practice, competencies/education, and planning approaches. NVivo 9, a qualitative software program [22], was used to organize and analyse the data. Members of the research team independently coded text within the policy documents using the coding template. After all the documents were coded and reviewed by two researchers, reports were obtained for each code, reports were reviewed by the entire the team, and consensus achieved on the coded text. A comparative analysis of BC and ON coded text was then conducted to identify similarities and differences. Narrative descriptions were written for the most frequently coded text and reviewed by the team.",

These functions were determined through extensive consultation processes in both provinces [23,24] and nationally [25]. There are distinct differences in how BC defines essential public health functions compared to ON and Canada; but for all three, essential functions of public health include monitoring and assessment of population health status, public health surveillance, health promotion, disease and injury prevention, and health protection and enforcement [15,25,26].

Practiced-based public health experience was highlighted as a key component of education/training programmes to prepare the public health workforce. Both BC and ON documents discussed several strategies to build education capacity in PH including the need to train new PH professionals, integrating core public health competencies in discipline-specific undergraduate education programmes, increasing the profile of PH careers and enrolment in PH programmes, increasing funding for PH education (subsidies, scholarships, and so on), expanding educational modalities (online, summer institutes), and increasing paid student internships and training placements in public health contexts [23,27,32]. In the last decade, both provinces have seen an increase in development of public health education programmes including Master\u2019s of public health (MPH). In addition, voluntary guidelines for Canadian universities offering MPH programmes were developed in 2006 and revised in 2009 [33]. Investments have been made by the ON government to enhance training and education opportunities for physicians to specialize in community medicine and public health [34] .",

Public health needs to ensure a competent and diverse public health workforce by providing ongoing staff development and skill building related to core public health competencies, including quality improvement and life-long learning programmes for staff members. Both provinces identified a number of training and education needs for the workforce that include developing knowledge and skills related to: leadership capacity, applying a population and equity lens, diversity and cultural competency, the social determinants of health, interprofessional collaboration, and use of evidence in practice. In BC, specific issues related to Aboriginal health and HHR planning were highlighted [35,36] while in ON, infection control training was identified [37,38]. These specific areas reflect contextual factors specific to each province. Consistent with arguments made by Fraser and Greenhalgh [39], the complexity of public health requires that the workforce must be capable of adapting and responding to the changing context in which they work. This capability is supported by not only identifying the competencies required to provide public health services but by moving beyond these to facilitate different ways for those in the workforce to continue to learn and build on existing competence.",

Historically HHR planning has focused primarily on staffing numbers; however, many of the PHHR policy documents have approached the issue of \u2018supply\u2019 of PHHR with a broader understanding of planning. This encompasses not only the numbers of staff, but their characteristics such as age of the workforce, and education and competencies, and incorporating issues such as the requirements to meet population health needs into planning. Policy documents published after the SARS event in ON discuss issues of \u2018shortages\u2019 of public health professionals [23,27]. Given the effects of the SARS event, other public health crises in recent years, and emerging shortages of health professionals in general, it is not surprising that early policy documents were focused on these concerns. For example, early documents discussed the shortage of key public health personnel, in particular, the need for Medical Officers of Health and those health professionals with expertise in infectious diseases [23,27,41]. In contrast with ON, BC documents were less focused on the discussion of shortages and improving PHHR supply with the exception of one specific recommendation of enhancing Aboriginal PH staff [35]. At the time of the policy analysis, BC had undertaken planning for a project to enumerate the public health workforce in order to \u2018to characterize, in a consistent manner, the size, composition and distribution of the formal public health system workforce among multiple health authorities and at the provincial level\u2019 [43] (p.1).",

Documents in both provinces also highlight the unique context of PH planning [27,43]. While governments had developed HHR policy documents, mostly in response to general shortages of nurses and physicians [20,45], many provincial HHR strategies lack a PH component despite the stated desire to strengthen the PH workforce, ensure equity, avoid resource duplication, and enhance coordination and capacity building. A key strategy identified in the documents was the importance of PH collaborating with governments and other partners beyond the immediate health system to address systemic and workforce issues [27,31]. A responsive public health system requires coordinated planning between systems and HHR. Strategic public health policy development and implementation needs to consider the systemic as well as PHHR issues to achieve policy goals [11].",

Both the BC Core Public Health Functions and Ontario Public Health Standards discuss the importance of public health addressing the specific needs of those populations considered vulnerable or at-risk; BC refers to populations of concern or vulnerable populations while ON uses the term priority populations. In a separate analysis, researchers examined BC and ON public health renewal documents for how they conceptualized health equity.

In addition, the use of both a population health and equity lens are explicitly described as fundamental to the core functions and contribute to identification of populations of concern. One example of a priority population for public health programmes and services in BC is First Nations/Aboriginal peoples reflecting that province\u2019s context [15,57] including development of a First Nations health plan of which HHR is a critical component [35]. Most BC documents explicitly identified First Nations/ Aboriginal peoples, and strongly emphasized the importance of developing culturally-appropriate programmes in partnership with Aboriginal communities and other diverse groups such as immigrants and refugees [31]. BC documents recognized that tailored programmes specifically supporting Aboriginal health and health determinants are essential, and that these programmes will need to be flexible to accommodate the diversity of contexts, communities, and governance structures that exist. In terms of HHR, BC also explicitly recognized that Aboriginal health supports are often overlooked in the public health sphere because they tend to fall outside of provincial health care jurisdiction.",

HHR planning in general has shifted away from a narrow focus on supply or numbers of healthcare providers to focus more on identification of population health needs and addressing health inequities, and the competencies required to meet these needs [20]. This shift is evident in many of the public health policy documents reviewed with much of the discussion focused on core public health competencies, education and training, and professional development as important elements to support the public health workforce. The delivery of effective and efficient public health programme and services requires consideration of both the competence and capabilities of the workforce [39]. These provincial policy documents also align with national strategic directions emphasizing core competencies unique to public health [10,58].

For BC, the early focus on essential public health functions influenced PHHR policy and placed greater emphasis on the competencies required to meet core functions. Furthermore, given the differences between the provinces in how public health is delivered, PHHR policy must be context specific [11]. BC and ON differ in how PH is situated in the broader health care system, whether integrated into health authorities in BC or more independent and autonomous in ON, this has implications for PHHR planning.

In recent months, ON published their provincial strategic plan for PH [60] and BC has published its updated guiding framework for PH [59]. Both provinces\u2019 documents highlight the importance of PHHR to achieve strategic directions in PH. However, while much policy-related work has been conducted to enhance PHHR planning in both provinces, there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness of the PHHR strategies. Looking ahead, future analyses should examine implementation of provincial PHHR policies at the local or regional level to examine the extent to which strategic directions are achieved. A key focus of the RePHS study is to examine the impact of provincial policies on the public health workforce at the public health unit or regional level in both provinces further enhancing understanding of PHHR policy and planning.",
