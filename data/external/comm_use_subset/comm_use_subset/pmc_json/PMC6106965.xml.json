The village chicken, or free-range, backyard, indigenous, local, or rural chicken, as it is often called, has been an integral part of the lives of many Africans for decades, contributing substantially to improvement in the livelihood of the people. They are found in nearly every household in rural and periurban communities [2, 3]. In Ghana, the population of the village chicken is estimated to constitute 60-80% of the national poultry population [4]. Guinea fowls also comprised seven percent of the 2009 national poultry population [5] and the population is growing. A number of government interventions and donor funding opportunities are in place to stimulate the growth of guinea fowl production [6].",

Infections of the oviduct and kidneys cause egg production losses, poor egg quality, urate deposits in kidneys, and increased mortality [16] (Cook et al., 2012). The disease is caused by a single stranded RNA Coronavirus called infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008).",

If local chickens and guinea fowls are susceptible to some of the devastating diseases afflicting commercial poultry, will they be susceptible to IBV which has already been confirmed in the Ga-East district?

Appropriate positive and negative controls included in the test kit were added to each plate run. The manufacturer's instructions were followed with some slight modifications. Briefly, test sera and ELISA test reagents were bought to room temperature. Prior to being assayed, a 1:500 dilution of the samples was made with manufacturer's diluent in a 2-step process. 100 \u03bcl of each diluted sample was then pipetted into the appropriate well on the antigen-coated plate. One hundred microliters of undiluted positive and negative controls was added to their appropriate wells in duplicate. The plate was incubated for 30 mins at room temperature. Plates were then manually washed five times with deionised water and blotted dry on laboratory tissue paper after washing. Hundred microliters of conjugate was added to all wells and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30\u00b12 mins. Washing and blotting were repeated as described above. One hundred microliters of TMB substrate was added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 15\u00b11 mins. To stop the reaction, 100 \u03bcl of stop solution was added to all the wells.

The nondetection of IBV in guinea fowls could be attributed to a number of reasons. First of all, apart from chickens, the only other avian species with confirmed IBV infection are commercially reared pheasants [22, 23]. However, with antibodies to IBV having been reported in other bird species, including turkeys and quails [24, 25], we considered that it is worth investigating the possibility of chicken-cohabiting guinea fowls being infected. Additionally, the fewer guinea fowls sampled could lead us to miss any few positives within the population if the prevalence was low to begin with. It is also not clear whether the age range of the guinea fowls was significant in the negative results obtained. To our knowledge, there was no literature to indicate that it would be so. Protection from maternal antibodies would have waned by the age we sampled. However, it is also possible that because they were young, they may not have yet lived long enough to have been exposed. It appears, however, that guinea fowls are not susceptible to IBV infections but to other types of coronaviruses that are antigenically and or genetically related to IBV as reported elsewhere [26\u201328].",

The lower prevalence in free-range chickens observed could also be attributed to the absence of IBV vaccine usage in commercial poultry in the country. Vaccinations with suitable IBV serotype(s) remain the practical method of controlling IBV infections in poultry population [16, 32]. Both inactivated and live attenuated IBV vaccines are used in the commercial poultry industry in Nigeria and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to control the disease. This introduces vaccine viral strains into the environment which could be transmitted horizontally to the local chickens via aerosol, feed, or water as they scavenge for food in the neighbourhood of these commercial birds [33]. Thus local chickens from these countries could have been exposed to field IBV and/or vaccine strains against which antibodies would have been developed. Hence the resultant high IBV prevalence recorded in the studies in those countries. We did not observe a significant association between age and IBV seroprevalence (data not shown) but a significant difference was observed among local chickens in the 2 communities. We believe the variation could be due to differences in sample size and not environmental, host, or pathological factors.",
