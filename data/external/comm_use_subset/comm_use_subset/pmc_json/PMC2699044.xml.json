These methods have further improved the safety of plasma-derived or plasmacontaining products such that no new cases of HIV, HBV, or HCV transmission from plasma or recombinant therapies have been reported in the US since 1997 [www.hemophilia.org]. However, solvent/detergent, which is the most common virus inactivation technique used in the preparation of plasma-derived products, is mainly effective against lipid-enveloped viruses, such as HIV, HBV, HCV, HTLV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus) and WNV (West Nile virus). NLE viruses, such as parvoviruses, enteroviruses and circoviruses, are resistant to inactivation via solvent/detergent treatment and to some degree against heat and radiation as well [12]. Parvovirus B19 (B19V) and two genotypes of parvovirus PARV4, have been found as contaminants in plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates [13, 14]. Thus, the risk of viral infection remains when plasma-derived and plasma-containing recombinant FVIII products are used [15, 16].",

Recombinant FVIII products are now classified into three generations (as defined by MASAC, the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the National Hemophilia Foundation) based on the degree of elimination of plasma and albumin from production and/or formulation steps, as outlined in Table 1 [MASAC #182]. First generation products use plasma and/or albumin during both the cell culture process and the final formulation steps, while 2nd generation products use serum proteins during the cell culture process only. These early recombinant products were effective in reducing the risk of pathogen transmission but the presence of serum components was still a concern. Indeed, one first generation recombinant FVIII product containing human serum albumin (Kogenate,Bayer) was suggested as a source of B19V transmission [19]. Moreover, the presence of human or animal proteins in therapeutic products potentially puts patients at risk of contracting novel infections, including those caused by not-yet detectable pathogens. These concerns prompted MASAC to issue recommendation #106: \u201cManufacturers of the recombinant products are strongly encouraged to avoid using human and animal proteins in manufacturing their products.\u201d Only by completely removing plasma proteins from the cell culture and final formulation processes could the risk of infectious disease transmission from recombinant products be totally eliminated. Such plasma-free recombinant proteins were classified as third generation products.",

Specifically, the serum-and protein-free synthetic minimal medium used for producing Advate contains ultrafiltered soy bean peptides with an average molecular weight of <500 Daltons, along with sugars, salts and other components which are added to further nourish the CHO cells. The FVIII is then purified through a series of chromatography steps, including an immunoaffinity chromatography process utilizing a monoclonal antibody produced from hybridoma cells grown for more than 30 generations in a plasma-free environment. Advate is then stabilized with trehalose [20]. Therefore, since Advate is never exposed to plasma, the risk of transmitting known and emerging bloodborne pathogens is eliminated. Current manufacturing processes address disease threats that have endangered the blood supply in the past, but there are others for which donated plasma is not routinely screened [12]. For example, human herpesvirus 8, the causative agent for Kaposi's sarcoma, has been shown to be transmitted through blood and blood products [21, 22]. Although the lipid membranes of enveloped viruses generally render them susceptible to inactivation by combinations of solvents and detergents, the transmission of lipid-enveloped WNV via blood transfusion [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ mm5313a1.htm] still raises new concerns about the safety of the blood supply. Therefore, due to the fact that solvent/detergent and nanofiltration techniques are not 100% efficient against all pathogens, plasma components need to be completely removed from the manufacturing process in order to eliminate the risk of pathogen transmission through blood compo-nents.",

None of the four cases of transfusion-transmitted vCJD transmission have been associated with plasma-derived factor concentrates. No cases of vCJD transmission via blood transfusion have been reported in the US. However, the potential for vCJD transmission via plasma products cannot be excluded yet [28]. A nine year study in sheep [29] demonstrated that two different TSE agents (BSE and scrapie) have unexpectedly high rates of transmission through blood transfusion, with relatively short and consistent incubation periods. These experiments suggest that the infectivity titers in the blood are quite high, and that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for prions.",

Development of serum-free media is generally difficult and must be individually tailored for each process and cell line.

Therefore, because proteins are often sensitive to a wide range of factors such as temperature, pH, surface adsorption and salt concentration, they are typically formulated with a mixture of excipients to ensure stability.

In addition, it is often the case that the recombinant protein is required in very small therapeutic doses and can be denatured by surface adsorption to glass vials.To prevent this issue, bulking agents like carbohydrates (e.g., sucrose), or proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA) or animal-derived gelatin are added in excess of the active protein.As a formulation excipient, HSA has an excellent stability and an acceptable safety profile [52, 53], and along with gelatin, was traditionally among the most commonly used excipients.However, as is the case with all plasma-derived products, the risk of pathogen transmission could not be eliminated. Additionally, HSA exhibits structural heterogeneity and batch-to-batch variability; its pharmacopoeial purity requirement is only \u2265 96%, with the undesired components being a mixture of polymers of HSA and other contaminating plasma proteins remaining from the purification process [54]. Such concerns prompted manufacturers to switch to sugar-based final formulations and to develop a recombinant, plasma-free albumin produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for use as a stabilizer in biopharmaceutical manufacturing [55]. Similarly, Pichia pastoris yeast was engineered to produce recombinant animal-free gelatin, which presents a reduced risk of allergic responses compared to tissue-derived substances [56, 57].",

            "text": "Most recombinant human proteins have been shown to be immunogenic [58], although the antibody responses they generate are generally variable and of low titer.However, these antibodies can inhibit drug efficacy and cause life-threatening complications when directed against either endogenous self-proteins or exogenous therapeutic proteins [59].The production of antibodies against recombinant proteins is influenced by several factors, including structural properties of the protein, formulation, dose, route of administration, presence of impurities and the formation of aggregates [60]. For example, high molecular weight complexes formed between rhIFN-\u03b12 and HSA have been linked to the formation of neutralizing antibodies against the interferon molecule [59].This prompted researchers to develop albumin-free formulations [61] in which HSA is replaced by other excipients that can prevent oxidation, adsorption and aggregation.A new formulation of IFN-\u03b21a [RNF or Rebif New Formulation, EMD Serono] was approved in Europe in August 2007 for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. RNF is HSA-free and is produced by a CHO cell line in serum-free culture medium [62]. Overall results from a phase IIIb study suggest that RNF has improved local tolerability and immunogenicity compared with a historical study of the original formulation [63], and the authors attribute these benefits largely to the absence of serum components (HSA and FBS) from the preparation.",

Repeated infusions over an extended period or over the lifetime of the patient increase the cumulative risk of pathogen transmission. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have presented an innovative approach to the treatment of illnesses in which the immune system may be compromised, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders [64]. Successive waves of technology have advanced mAb development from murine antibodies to chimeric, humanized antibodies and finally to fully-human antibodies. mAb manufacturing is trending towards the adaptation of cell lines to serum-free media, along with the removal of animal components from the purification and formulation processes [45, 65\u201367]. One of the first examples of this trend is the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist, which is approved for the treatment of several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. The TNF antagonist has evolved from being a chimeric mAb produced from cells grown in media containg serum components (Remicade; Centocor) to a fully human anti-TNF\u03b1 mAb that is plasmafree in both its manufacturing and formulation (Humira; Abbott). Since TNF plays a critical role in modulating the inflammatory immune response, patients treated with TNF antagonists are at special risk for serious infections, which further emphasizes the need for such therapies to be completely pathogen-free. In preventive therapies such as vaccines, minimizing the risk of pathogen transmission is also of paramount importance since vaccines are typically administered to large numbers of children and elderly individuals.Animal proteinfree technology has been applied in the development of pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines, in which embryonated egg-based technology is currently being replaced by mammalian cell lines grown in serum-free, protein-free medium. Examples include the Vero cell-based H5N1 pandemic mock-up vaccine that has completed preclinical development and is awaiting licensure (Baxter) and a new MDCK cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine that was recently licensed in Europe (Optaflu; Novartis).",

The UK government required the quarantine of equipment and procedure rooms used on patients who were at risk of having contracted vCJD from infected donors, including hemophilia patients who received plasma-derived factor concentrates. The prohibitive logistics and cost of dedicating equipment for at-risk patients may have made hospitals and dental providers less likely to offer standard services to these patients [68]. Problems such as these can be mitigated by providing previously untreated patients with products that have been manufactured without the addition of animalderived components. Such products are not only an obvious choice for young, previously-untreated and unexposed patients, but should also be considered for patients with existing infections (such as HIV, HBV, or HCV) who must be concerned about the introduction of additional pathogens, which could further complicate a pre-existing infection [69].",

More sensitive tests have been instituted, such as PCRbased nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT), including minipool NAT and single donor testing (ID NAT).

Donated blood is routinely tested for 6 pathogens: HBV, HCV, HIV-1 and-2,HTLV-I and-II, Syphilis and WNV (when appli-cable). NAT is used to detect HIV, HCV, and WNV.

However, the risk from novel or emerging pathogens must be taken seriously [72] and, as noted by the CDC, \u201cin order to protect the safety of the blood supply and blood-derived therapies, it must be recognized that new pathogens will continue to emerge\u201d[73]. UK health officials withdrew all blood and blood products obtained from donors in which vCJD was subsequently detected, and today, all plasma used in the UK to produce therapeutics is imported. The UK is among many countries (including Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Ireland, Canada and Japan) that are switching to recombinant products as a standard for the treatment of hemophilia A, and regulatory agencies and physicians' organizations in North America and Europe have prompted drug and device manufacturers to find alternatives to human and animal raw materials and additives whenever possible (Table 2).The FDA and the International Conference on Harmonisation, which develops guidelines for the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan and the US, have provided documents guiding the sourcing, characterization and testing of raw materials derived from humans or animals, as well as guiding the evaluation of protein therapeutics for the presence of viruses [79\u201382].The objective is to avoid transmission of adventitious agents, an issue that would not exist if animal-free substances were used in the manufacturing process.

Some of these drugs are genetically modified for greater efficacy, increased half-life, or lower immunogenicity, while others are tailored to be effective in specific groups of patients, or engineered to be effectively administered through less invasive routes. Erythropoeisis-stimulating agents, which were introduced in the late 1980s for the management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease [84], serve as a good illustration of the evolution of recombinant therapeutic protein manufacturing. First, a recombinant product replaced its blood-derived predecessors. In the next phase, a product with a longer half-life was developed (darbepoetin \u03b1 or Aranesp).This product then evolved through conversion to an HSA-free formulation [85], followed by serum-free formulations of Epoetin \u03b1 (outside the US, Eprex; Ortho Biotech) and Epoetin \u03b2 (NeoRecormon; Roche). Most recently, a PF, PEGylated recombinant erythropoietin \u03b2 with a longer half-life was developed and licensed in Europe (Mircera; Roche).",

Nonetheless, eliminating animal-derived components from media can significantly alter culture performance as well as post-translational protein modifications. The glycosylation pattern of an antibody molecule can affect its structural integrity, thus influencing both its biological function and its physicochemical properties. Heterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is evident in mAbs produced by hybridoma cells grown in media with different serum content [86]. In addition to influencing pharmacokinetics, glycosylation may influence both efficacy and safety, particularly immunogenicity [87].",

Biopharmaceuticals may become exposed to various conditions of stress, such as low pH or heat, which can potentially result in protein misfolding and the formation of amyloid-like structures [62].The mechanisms by which different culture, formulation and storage conditions affect the physical stability of proteins are an active area of research. Biopharmaceuticals require monitoring for potentially rare safety issues that might only be seen in studies of a large number of patients over an extended period of time. Thus, to ensure the safety of new PF products, phase IV post-licensure safety surveillance studies must be conducted to monitor products for efficacy as well as for rare, adverse events.",

With the average cost of developing a biopharmaceutical product exceeding $1 billion [http://csdd.tufts.edu], manufacturers should make every effort to use the safest possible technologies, such as a PF manufacturing process. Given that no major infectious agent outbreaks have occurred in recent years, a false sense of security may be in place, but steps should be taken to avoid complacency. Such issues need to be addressed now that PF technology has matured and become more feasible, and this should be accomplished prior to the next major threat from a new, emerging pathogen.",
