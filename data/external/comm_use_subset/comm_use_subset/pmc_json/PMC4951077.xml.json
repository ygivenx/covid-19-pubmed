            "text": "The use of sensitive molecular tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has shown that several respiratory viruses frequently been detected in children who need hospitalization for respiratory tract infection (RTI) [1,2]. It has also been documented that children hospitalized with RTI often have multiple viruses, and that asymptomatic hospital controls may frequently be positive for respiratory viruses [3\u20136]. Outside the hospital setting, evidence exists for the presence of both well-known and recently detected viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV), in children with RTI [7,8]. However, it is more surprising that even asymptomatic children outside hospitals may harbor viruses in their airways, as has been recently shown [9\u201311]. We aim to study this phenomenon further, and describe the occurrence of a broad panel of respiratory pathogens in healthy children. Since nearly all Norwegian children attend day care on a daily basis, we have studied a group of apparently healthy children attending day care, taking into account the influence of possible confounding factors such as age, clinical signs of RTI, location in day care and season.",

Norwegian children start school at the age of six, and the children included were between the ages of 1\u20136.3 years. The number of children in the two day-care centers varied from 110 to 132 at each visit. The children were organized into five or six sections (the number differed during the two years), with 6\u201312 of the youngest children per section, aged 1\u20133.8 years, and four sections for the oldest with 16\u201318 children per section, aged 2.8\u20136.3 years. In total, 161 children participated in the study one or more times (median two times, range one to four), which resulted in 368 out of 484 possible (76.0%) inclusions (Fig 1). The majority of included children was both sampled by a nasopharyngeal sample (NPS) and underwent clinical examination, although some resisted the collection of NPS or clinical examination after inclusion. With the exception of one, all children usually stayed 41 hours per week in the day-care center. The inclusion criterion was informed written consent from parents or guardians on behalf of the children for each study visit. Each child could be included only once during each study visit. The exclusion criterion was previous nasal bleeding. At each inclusion, the parents answered a form of baseline demographics, household characteristics and medical history. One of four pediatricians conducted a standardized clinical examination of each child during daytime in the day-care area. The pediatricians classified the children into three groups based on clinical findings: 1. No RTI with normal findings, 2. Mild RTI with discrete signs of rhinitis, pharyngitis, simplex media otitis or secretory media otitis, and 3. Clear RTI with significant signs of rhino-pharyngitis, tonsillitis, purulent media otitis or auscultatory findings from the lower airways. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, Mid-Norway, Norway (no. 2011/2246).",

Samples were analyzed at the Department of Medical Microbiology, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. In total, 361 NPS were collected, though some samples of poor quality (n = 18) were excluded. The NPS were analyzed with semi-quantitative, real-time PCR for 19 respiratory pathogens including human adenovirus (HAdV), HBoV, human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43, 229E, NL63, human enterovirus (HEV), human parechovirus (HPeV), hMPV, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1\u20134, RSV, HRV, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The PCRs were in-house, real-time assays with TaqMan probes [12]. The amount of virus in each sample was recorded semi-quantitatively, and based on the cycle threshold value (Ct-value). Ct-values above 40 were regarded as virus-negative.",

The Monte Carlo simulation test described by Hope was used to test whether respiratory pathogens occurred independently of each other among children, using the algorithm by Patefield [13,14]. The test compared the observed distribution of the number of pathogens in a nasopharyngeal sample, with a distribution based on the assumption that pathogens occurred independently of each other and conditional on their observed frequencies. The test was based on 2,000 simulations of the null hypothesis. Following the rejection of the null hypothesis (see Results), the same approach was subsequently used to test whether the distribution of pathogens among day-care sections and sampling times could account for the general tendency of respiratory pathogens to occur together in NPS. In addition, in the latter test, the null distribution was conditional on the distribution of pathogens among day-care sections and sampling times. Hope\u2019s test was further used to test in pairs whether the three most common pathogens, HEV, HPeV and HRV, occurred independently of each other. The sequential Bonferroni method was also used to control the familywise Type I error rate in these three tests [15]. The occurrence in NPS of the same three respiratory pathogens was analyzed in an explorative manner using generalized linear mixed-effect models with logit link functions [16]. Day-care sections and sampling times (seasons) were included in the logistic models as random explanatory variables, while the children\u2019s age in months and the occurrence of other viruses (coded as a binary variable) were included as fixed variables. The \u201ctop-down\u201d approach recommended by Diggle et al. was followed, in which the random part of models was first determined based on the \u201cbeyond optimal model\u201d, before obtaining the minimal adequate model by selecting among the candidate\u2019s fixed parts [17,18]. Model selection was based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [19]. The same approach was followed in order to study whether clinical findings were related to the occurrence of HRV, which was the virus most frequently found in the NPS. Day-care sections and sampling times (seasons) were again included as random explanatory variables, whereas the occurrence of HRV and children\u2019s age were included as fixed variables. The response variable was the occurrence of clear findings of RTI coded as a binary variable, with mild and no RTI findings as the reference category. Moreover, statistically significant values were defined as p<0.05 (two-sided), and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and R version 3.2.2 were used in the statistical analyses [20]. The R-package lme4 was used in the GLMM-modelling [21].",

Hence, our findings indicate that apparently healthy day-care children may harbor respiratory viruses and have clinical signs of an upper RTI, and even children without clinical signs may be virus positive. It is well-known that young children frequently have symptomatic RTIs, so it is not surprising that children sometimes may also have a RTI with few symptoms when they attend day care [22,23].",

One out of four visits to the day-care centers occurred during a RSV epidemic, which might explain that only one child had RSV. However, it may be possible that RSV more often causes severe disease and sick leave from day care. Rhinovirus appeared most frequently, but enterovirus and parechovirus were also common. Combinations of day-care sections (younger or older children) and sampling times (seasons) were the most important factors in determining the occurrence of picornaviruses. At any given sampling time, there was a large variation in the frequencies of the three picornaviruses among the various sections, and for most of the sections, there was a large variation at different sampling times. These observations may be relate to the fact that most respiratory viruses are epidemic and easily spread among children who are cared for in separate sections [24]. Indeed, this phenomenon was most common in the sections for the youngest children, who\u2014in particular\u2014are known to challenge good hygiene in day-care centers.",

Similarly, others reported that some virus combinations may appear more frequently than others in both children with and without RTI, and that co-infections with viruses may not be random in children with RTI [25\u201328]. Martin et al. showed that during the progress of a RTI in children, more respiratory viruses may appear [26]. Our data revealed that children with a clear RTI often had frequent upper RTIs during the six months prior to the inclusion in the study, and therefore might have a higher risk of being PCR positive for more than one viruses simultaneously, which is due to possible long-term viral excretion after clinical recovery.",

HRV occurred in both the sections of younger and older children, and varied randomly among combinations of sections and sampling times. Children with HRV-positive NPS had increased probability of a clear RTI. Consequently, in this study, HRV was the likely cause of many RTIs in children outside of a hospital, as has been shown by others [22,26,29\u201331]. However, we also detected HRV in nearly one-fifth of the children without clinical findings of a RTI, while others have detected HRV in asymptomatic children, which is more difficult to explain [9\u201311,30]. Peltola et al. examined various HRV strains and found that a minor fraction of HRV infections in children may be asymptomatic, and it has also been suggested that HRV PCR tests may persist as positive up to several weeks after clinical recovery [32,33]. Hence, our HRV detection in children without clinical findings can be a result of the carriage of virus after the recovery of symptoms or a newly acquired asymptomatic infection. We found that several children with HRV and clear signs of RTI attended day care and were apparently healthy, which could suggest that HRV in other cases may also cause very mild changes that are hard to detect at all. Recent data have shown that HRV-positive children with and without symptoms developed different systemic immune responses, which support that HRV detection may not always indicate symptomatic HRV infection [34].",

Serological studies have documented that most Finnish children may be infected with HPeV1 (83%) and HPeV2 (91%) before the age of five years [37]. HPeV3 is strongly related to sepsis-like disease and encephalitis, though not RTI, in infants [38].

However, it has also been shown that these viruses in particular may sometimes be detected for a long time in the airways, either due to prolonged excretion or due to the re-activation of a latent infection, and all three mechanisms may explain our findings [40,41].",

The day-care section was also considered, and turned out to be an important predictor of virus occurrence. Nasopharyngeal sampling is unpleasant and challenging to perform in apparently healthy children outside health institutions. However, we managed to collect NPS from more than 90% of the inclusions. Ideally, more samples from each child, using a stricter longitudinal design, might have had advantages over the present cross-sectional approach, but in real-life frequent sampling was not possible to attain. A major strength of the study is that pediatricians clinically examined all children, and their findings were used in the classification. Most studies on respiratory viruses and RTIs in day-care settings have relied on parental information of children\u2019s symptoms. Nonetheless, we found a poor correlation between symptoms and clinical signs. Others have similarly shown that symptoms are not entirely accurate in predicting an upper RTI in children [42]. On the other hand, the clinical entities of a mild and clear RTI, which were used in our classification, have not been validated. Each study visit was performed three-12 months apart, which is a long time from an epidemic and clinical perspective and, therefore, the analyses were not adjusted for repetitive data.",
