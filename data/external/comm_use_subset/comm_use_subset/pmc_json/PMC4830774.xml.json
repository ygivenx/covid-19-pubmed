            "text": "As one of the most common type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third cause of malignant deaths from cancer-associated worldwide [1\u20133]. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of HCC is difficult in its earliest stages without screening tests available [4]. Meanwhile, owing to its poor sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, high metastatic potential, and resistance to traditional drugs, it is dismal to the overall prognosis of patients with HCC. Thus, it is imperative to develop efficient chemotherapy that has become the great challenge in clinical treatment [5, 6]. In addition, most of current anticancer agents usually have short half-life in the blood circulation and poor aqueous solubility, which hampers therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy [7, 8]. Recently, nanomaterials have been widely used in biomedical field due to its unique physicochemical properties, including their size distribution, stability of dispersion, morphology, crystalline structure, and thermal properties, that might have the potential to overcome these problems [9]. The increased of application of nanomaterials resulted in raising hopes for employing nanoparticles as alternative anticancer agents [10, 11].",

As a marked imbalance, oxidative stress is the most often described between cellular defense mechanisms and consumption of ROS [27]. The ROS play an important role in many physiological processes. The redox imbalance is associated with many pathologies, such as skin disease, diabetes, cancer, Leigh syndrome, and other diseases [28]. Although many research groups describe the toxicity of AgNP induction of oxidative stress, little is known about the anticancer mechanisms of AgNPs [29]. It is of great interest to ascertain this mechanism of AgNPs. This study was to determine how AgNP-associated changes in redox balance will induce HePG-2 cells apoptosis.",

Meanwhile, as a biochemical marker of DNA damage, H2X was significantly activated by AgNPs. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6b, AgNP treatment triggered differential effects on JNK, ERK, and p38. AgNPs significantly inhibited total ERK and increased the JNK and p38. Meanwhile, treatment of the cells with AgNPs effectively suppressed the expression levels of total AKT in HePG-2 cells as shown in Fig. 6d. The caspase family exhibits important functions in the regulation process of cell apoptosis. Caspase-3 acts as a central regulator in the signaling network [41]. Therefore, the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was examined to evaluate their involvement and contribution to cell apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 6c, AgNPs significantly enhanced the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of downstream effect PARP.

AgNPs with dose-dependent manner significantly increased the apoptotic cell population (sub-G1). The studies on the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that the major mode of cell death induced by AgNPs was cell apoptosis. The mechanisms indicated that AgNPs promote caspase-3-mediated apoptosis by the involvement of ROS generation. Further investigations on apoptotic signaling pathway triggered by the AgNPs in HePG-2 cells are p53, AKT, and MAPKs pathways.
