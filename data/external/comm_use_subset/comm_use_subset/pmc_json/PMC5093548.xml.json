To study molecular evolutionary changes in EBOV genomes in the current epidemic, we obtained 1020 strains, for which the isolated dates are given. Although we focused on full-length genomes, a minor portion was relatively short in length, or many unidentified \u201cN\u201d bases were included, partly because of the stringent sterilization treatment obligated by the local government3. Because these will give odd values of mono- and oligonucleotide compositions, we focused on 935 genomes longer than 18.5 kb after omitting N bases, which were derived from 244 Guinea, 156 Liberia and 535 Sierra Leone strains. To conduct the present spatiotemporal analysis, 15 strains isolated from several other geographic areas were omitted.",

Because mutations occur primarily as random processes, mononucleotide compositions for strains isolated even around the same day clearly differed from each other, which resulted in evident compositional diversity. Despite this diversity, which should also be due to sequencing uncertainty, linear regression lines appear to show a time-dependent increasing or decreasing trend, a possible increase for C% and G% and a possible decrease for A% and U%.

Two distinct models can explain the common increasing or decreasing trend among the three areas, which was observed for a wide range of mono- and oligonucleotides. [Model 1] Throughout the current EBOV epidemic, virus movement between the three areas was extensive; therefore, the time-dependent trend of directional changes in oligonucleotide composition was common among the areas. [Model 2] Even without the extensive mixing of viruses, common directional changes can occur. For example, viruses inevitably depend on many host factors for their growth, but human cells may not provide an ideal growth environment for invading viruses; therefore, common directional changes occur after invasions from nonhumans for supporting more efficient growth in human cells. In this connection, Park et al.3 reported there was no clear evidence for import or export of EBOV across national borders after its initial introduction. Furthermore, although an increasing or decreasing trend for a wide range of mono- and oligonucleotides is common among the three areas, their actual composition (%) and the slope angle of the directional change often differ among the areas. This observation is consistent with Model 2 and the report by Park et al.3 but not with Model 1, as discussed below from various aspects.",

In contrast, MERS viruses were repeatedly transmitted from nonhumans, mainly camels, in this epidemic25, although its original natural host is thought to be bats26. Because direct nonhuman hosts for different human isolates differ among isolates, information on camel-derived strains in the current epidemic is important. From the NCBI Virus Variation Database24, we found 91 and 16 strains from humans and camels, respectively, with known isolated dates. The total number of MERS virus genomes is approximately one tenth of EBOV genomes, but their sequence length, even after omitting N bases, is mostly similar to its genome size (ca. 30 kb); only one sequence that was evidently short (29.3 kb) was omitted from this analysis. We grouped sequences in each month and analyzed the averaged mono- and oligonucleotides (from 2 to 5-mers) for each month and host.",

The sequence length cut-off was not included because the genome is composed of eight segments of various lengths and a simple, satisfactory criterion for length cut-off could not be set. Alternatively, because 20 times more sequences are available than for EBOV, we selected years with at least ten strains of one category to reduce the artefactual effects derived from sequencing uncertainty. Then, to analyze time-series changes, we selected human or avian A subtypes with more than five years fulfilling the above threshold (\u2265ten strains per year); the human B type also fitted these criteria. In the case of H1N1/09161718 (starting from 2009 and abbreviated pH1N1 in the database), a sufficient number of sequences fulfilling the above threshold was available even per month and, therefore, pH1N1 sequences in each month were analyzed; importantly, this allowed the study of changes occurring within one outbreak in detail.

Here, we discuss the backset occurring after one outbreak may relate to the differential slopes of directional changes observed for different subtypes (Figs 5 and 6). pH1N1 strains, which are primarily derived from one outbreak, show an evidently steeper slope than H1N1 and H3N2 strains derived from multiple outbreaks, indicating a higher rate of pH1N1genome sequence changes. The first discussion was whether pH1N1 had an evidently higher mutation rate than H1N1 and H3N2. We propose here that without introducing the higher mutation rate of pH1N1, its seemingly higher rate of genome sequence changes can be explained by the model that conforms to the abrupt backset that occurred after an outbreak. When considering a viral infection spread, the ratio of persons with or without proper resistance to the viral infection (e.g., antibodies that are highly effective against the respective strain) becomes important. Therefore, the blooming strains (and their close relatives) in a certain outbreak (especially in a pandemic) may not be a very suitable strain for restarting the next outbreak because antibodies highly effective against the blooming strains are held by a large portion of humans. Less blooming strains, that are less adapted to humans, may become good starting strains for the next outbreak, resulting in a backset after one outbreak, as observed in Figs 5b and 6b and Supplementary Fig. 2. Hence, the evolutionary change focusing on strains belonging to a single outbreak looks higher than those belonging to multiple outbreaks, giving a steeper slope. To illustrate this interpretation, we added hypothetical data of H3N2 strains belonging to one outbreak as a series of small light-brown dots representing the dinucleotide compositions hypothesized for individual months, whose slope angle simply mimics that of pH1N1. Although other various mechanisms must be included to explain the backset after one outbreak, we propose that the steep slope of pH1N1 can be explained without introducing the higher mutation rate of pH1N1.",

At the beginning stage of three independent epidemics, most strains had one copy of the 20-mer, but during the course of human-to-human transmission the copy number decreased in the viral population and were almost completely lost at the final stage in all three subtypes; i.e., the strains having this 20-mer sequence progressively reduced their share in viral populations, regardless of differences in subtypes. We think that this common decrease reflects a certain inconvenience for efficient growth in human cells and will reoccur with a high probability after a future invasion.

Three influenza A subtypes may not be sufficient to judge the reoccurrence of the change, and therefore, our group has started to analyze the time-series changes in experimentally validated siRNA sequences, by focusing on both human and avian strains. An important issue is clarification of biological mechanisms responsible for directional changes in oligonucleotide occurrences after host changes. If the mechanism is clarified, reoccurrence in the future should become much clearly defined.

Because the number of MERS virus sequences is small, compared with the other two viruses analyzed, a time-series analysis was conducted for the months having at least three strains, and when the number of strains for a certain month was less than 3, these were combined with those of the nearest neighboring month that had the lower number of strains than the other neighbor. From the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource27 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/), a total of ca. 200,000 segment sequences derived from ca. 25,000 influenza A and B virus strains were obtained on Sep. 1 (2015). We calculated mono- and oligonucleotide occurrences in eight genome segments of influenza virus strains and summed up the occurrences for each strain. To prevent possible misassignment from a large number of pH1N1 strains, relatively small numbers of human classical H1N1 strains isolated from 2009 were omitted from the present analysis. Influenza virus is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus, and therefore, the sequences analyzed are complementary to viral genome sequences. Computer codes are available from K.W.
