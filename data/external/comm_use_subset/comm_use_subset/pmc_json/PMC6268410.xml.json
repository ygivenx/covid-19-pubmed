In most references mentioned, carvacrol and/or thymol were the major compounds. Thus, the essential oil composition of S. thymbra from Turkey contained mainly carvacrol and \u03b3-terpinene [25]. S. thymbra essential oil from Lebanon was characterized by similar amounts of p-cymene (10.76%), \u03b1-pinene (10.15%), thymol (9.92%) and sabinene (8.64%) [10]. According to the essential oil composition of this species collected from Crete (Greece) from two locations, it presented different chemotypes. In the sample from Aktotiri the major compounds were carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene and \u03b3-terpinene (44.6%, 0.3%, 11.9% and 25.5% respectively), while in the other sample the main compounds were thymol (35.5%), \u03b3-terpinene (27.6%), p-cymene (10.4%) and carvacrol (3.2%) [24]. The essential oil of the same species growing wild in Turkey was also dominated by carvacrol (53.7%), followed by \u03b3-terpinene (17.6%), thymol (13%) and p-cymene (10.1%) [13]. Furthermore, in a study of the essential oil composition of samples from 13 essential oils of S. thymbra from different locations in Crete, the findings showed a high compositional variation in which carvacrol varied significantly (5.2\u201365%), thymol (0.1\u201365.6%), \u03b3-terpinene (20\u20134.4%) and cymene (5.5\u201315%) [22]. Moreover, a study was carried out to evaluate the effect of harvesting time on essential oil composition of S. thymbra collected from the same location at different vegetation stages. The findings showed that the major compounds in the vegetation phase were thymol (27.88%), followed by \u03b3-terpinene (17.02%) and carvacrol (11.88%), while in full flowering phase carvacrol (29.18%), thymol (17.22%) and \u03b3-terpinene (12.45%) were the main compounds, and in the fruiting phase thymol (20.73%) was again the main compound, followed by \u03b3-terpinene 14.91% and carvacrol 12.8% [26].",

However, its principal constituents were determined to be mainly carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene, and \u03b3-terpinene, and very rarely \u03b1-pinene and sabinene.

The results of the DPPH scavenging assay of S. thymbra essential oil and its principal components and the synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are shown in Figure 1. The results showed that S. thymbra essential oil possessed strong antioxidant activity, as seen from the concentrations at which 50% radical scavenging occurred (IC50 = 0.0967 mg/mL), being better than \u03b3-terpinene and thymol and quite similar to BHA. It has been shown that the IC50 of Origanum vulgare essential oil, which was dominated by \u03b3-terpinene and thymol (34.4% and 31.8%, respectively) was better than BHA [32]. Moreover, O. vulgare essential oil, containing 49% of \u03b3-terpinene and 15% of thymol, showed an IC50 value quite similar to our results. Also, carvacrol, present in relative high amounts in Thymbra capitata oil can be partly responsible for high antioxidant activity, whereas in O. vulgare oil the activity may be attributed to two components, \u03b3-terpinene and thymol [33]. According to earlier reports, some structural features, such as the presence of strongly activated methylene groups in the molecule, are probably the reason for antioxidant activity of monoterpene hydrocarbons [34].",

            "text": "It is evident that there is a relationship between the high activity of tested oil and the presence of phenol components such as thymol and carvacrol. It seems likely that thymol and carvacrol interfere with the activity of cell wall enzymes like chitin synthase/chitinase as well as \u03b1- and \u03b2-glucanases of fungi [37,38]. According to literature data, the mode of action of essential oils against bacteria cannot be attributed to one specific mechanism, and not all of these mechanisms are separate targets, some are affected as a result of another mechanism being targeted [39,40]. One of important action of essential oils against bacteria is their hydrophobicity, which enables them to partition in the lipids of the bacterial cell membrane and mitochondria, disturbing the structures and rendering them more permeable and leading to leakage of cell content [41,42,43]. Although a certain amount of leakage from bacterial cells may be tolerated without loss of viability, extensive loss of cell contents or the exit of critical molecules and ions will lead to death [44]. Consequently, the high content of phenolic components may account for the high antimicrobial activity of carvacrol-type oils [45]. It should be noted that the antimicrobial activity of S. thymbra against the pathogenic bacteria and fungi was lower (or equal) as compared to the essential oils compounds tested here\u2014thymol and carvacrol. Presumably, this activity is not derived only from the presence of these phenols, but part of the activity resulted from the effect of minor active constituents. Thus, synergistic or antagonistic activity between some components may affect the observed antimicrobial activity of the oils. In the study of Cosentino et al. [46], the high p-cymene content observed in Sardinian T. capitatus and T. herba-barona \u2018sample a\u2019 may have antagonized the antimicrobial action of phenols, resulting in a weaker activity of these oils, in comparation to thymol and carvacrol. This may explain in part the higher activity of thymol and carvacrol when evaluated separately. Also, some authors discussed synergistic and antagonistic effect of components and essential oils [47]. They concluded that the effects of thymol and carvacrol are responsible for the different antibacterial activities of the essential oil of various oil chemotypes. On the other hand, there are also some reports concerning a disadvantageous antagonistic effect, weakening the essential oil action as compared with its constituents. ",

The organisms were obtained from the Mycological Laboratory, Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \u201cSini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107\u201d, Belgrade, Serbia. The micromycetes were maintained on malt agar and the cultures stored at 4 \u00b0C and sub-cultured once a month [62]. In order to investigate the antifungal activity of the extracts, a modified microdilution technique was used [63,64,65]. The fungal spores were washed from the surface of agar plates with sterile 0.85% saline containing 0.1% Tween 80 (v/v). The spore suspension was adjusted with sterile saline to a concentration of approximately 1.0 \u00d7 105 in a final volume of 100 \u03bcL per well. The inocula were stored at 4 \u00b0C for further use. Dilutions of the inocula were cultured on solid malt agar to verify the absence of contamination and to check the validity of the inoculum. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations were performed by a serial dilution technique using 96-well microtiter plates. The compounds investigated were added in broth Malt medium with inoculum. The microplates were incubated for 72 h at 28 \u00b0C. The lowest concentrations without visible growth (at the binocular microscope) were defined as MICs. The fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by serial subcultivation of a 2 \u03bcL aliquot into microtiter plates containing 100 \u03bcL of broth per well and further incubation for 72 h at 28 \u00b0C. The lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as MFC indicating 99.5% killing of the original inoculum.

The organisms were obtained from the Mycological Laboratory, Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \u201cSini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107\u201d, Belgrade, Serbia. The antibacterial assay was carried out by microdilution method [63,64,65] in order to determine the antibacterial activity of compounds tested against the human pathogenic bacteria. The bacterial suspensions were adjusted with sterile saline to a concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL. The inocula were prepared daily and stored at +4 \u00b0C until use. Dilutions of the inocula were cultured on solid medium to verify the absence of contamination and to check the validity of the inoculum.",

The bacterial suspension was adjusted with sterile saline to a concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 105 cfu/mL. Compounds to be investigated were dissolved in broth LB broth (100 \u03bcL) with bacterial inoculum (1.0 \u00d7 104 cfu per well) to achieve the wanted concentrations (1 mg/mL). The microplates were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. The lowest concentrations without visible growth (at the binocular microscope) were defined as concentrations that completely inhibited bacterial growth (MICs). The MBCs were determined by serial sub-cultivation of 2 \u03bcL into microtitre plates containing 100 \u03bcL of broth per well and further incubation for 72 h. The lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as the MBC, indicating 99.5% killing of the original inoculum. The optical density of each well was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm by Microplate Manager 4.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and compared with a blank and a positive control. Streptomycin was used as a positive control (1 mg/mL DMSO). Two replicates were done for each compound and experiments were repeated three times.",

It can also be concluded that the essential oils of all Satureja species possess strong antimicrobial activities to different extents against organisms of importance to food spoilage and/or poisoning (Salmonella, Listeria, Penicillium and Aspergillus), as well as to those of interest to the medical field such as Staphyloccocus, Apergillus fumigatus and Candida. The majority of the essential oils are classified as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) [66], Their use in foods as preservatives could be limited due to flavor considerations, since effective antimicrobial doses may exceed organoleptically acceptable levels. Still, there are strong consumer trends towards natural alternatives to chemical antimicrobial agents and this is supported by changes in legislation. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for accurate knowledge of the minimum inhibitory (effective) concentrations (MIC) of essential oils to enable a balance between the sensory acceptability and antimicrobial efficacy in the food matrix, preparation and possible toxicology. Addition of oils is therefore not problematic especially not when used in such a small amount as we define according to the MIC\u2019s and MBC/MFC\u2019s obtained in this study. In view of broad activity, this essential oil may find industrial applications as natural preservatives and conservation agent in the cosmetic and/or food industries and as active ingredient in medical preparations.",
