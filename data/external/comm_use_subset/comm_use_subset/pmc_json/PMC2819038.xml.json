The genome of hCoV-NL63 comprises 27,553 nt and has a gene organization conserved in all CoV, i.e., gene 1a/b, spike (S), open reading frame 3 (ORF 3), envelope (E), membrane (M) and the nucleocapsid (N) gene. CoV virions consist of a nucleocapsid core surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins, S, E, and M. CoV assemble and bud at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [8,9]. While the budding site of several CoV has been localized at the ERGIC, the viral surface proteins can also be found in downstream compartments of the secretory pathway [8]. M localizes predominantly in the Golgi apparatus [10,11], S is found along the secretory pathway and at the plasma membrane [12,13], and E is detected in perinuclear regions, the ER and Golgi [14-16]. S and M are typically glycosylated and it was shown that glycosylation plays an important role in the generation of bioactive protein conformations and influences fusion activity, receptor binding, and antigenic properties of CoV [17-20].",

            "text": "The ORF 3 is the only accessory ORF conserved in all CoVs [30]. Most investigations of its functionality have been done on the example of SARS-CoV ORF 3a. The SARS-CoV ORF 3a protein is expressed in infected cells and patient sera contained antibodies reactive with recombinant ORF 3a antigen. The N-terminal ectodomain was able to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies in rabbits [31]. SARS-CoV ORF 3a protein is a triple-spanning membrane protein with a similar topology as the M protein, and is integrated into virions [32]. Moreover, truncated forms were discovered for recombinantly and virally expressed ORF 3a protein which could also be detected in virions [33]. Unlike the M protein it is not N-glycosylated but O-glycosylated and it was shown to interact with E, M and S protein [16,34-36]. Subcellular localization of ORF 3a protein was found to be at the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane where it was also internalized by endocytosis [36]. ORF 3a protein was shown to induce apoptosis [37] and cell cycle arrest [38] and to up-regulate expression of fibrinogen in lung epithelial cells [39]. Although small interfering RNAs targeting the ORF 3a-specific viral subgenomic RNA were able to reduce viral replication [40], deletion of ORF 3a from an infectious cDNA clone had no effect on viral replication in cell culture and mice [28]. Moreover it has been demonstrated that SARS-ORF 3a protein forms a homotetramer through inter-protein disulfide bonds, functionally working as a potassium ion channel that modulates virus release [41]. Very recently it was shown that the ORF 3a protein disrupts the architecture of the Golgi apparatus and might thus be responsible for the formation of vesicular structures in which virus replication takes place [42].",

For the ORF 3 protein of group 1 (alpha) CoVs investigations have focused on the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV, group 1b, alpha) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, group 1a, alpha) that cause enteropathogenic diarrhea in swine [43]. It was shown that virulence of these viruses could be reduced by altering the ORF 3 gene through cell culture adaptation [44,45]. For hCoV-NL63, preliminary experiments suggested that deletion of ORF 3 had little influence on viral replication in cell culture [46]. However, the closely related hCoV-229E has a homologous gene named ORF 4 that is split into two ORFs (4a and 4b) in cell culture but maintained in all circulating viruses. This suggests an in-vivo function that may not be necessary for viral replication in cell culture [47].",

As expected, the M protein and a protein corresponding to ORF 3 protein migrated at corresponding heights in Western blots (Figure 5A). Both proteins showed additional bands at slightly higher molecular mass, consistent with posttranslational modification. In contrast to virus-infected cells, cells overexpressing ORF 3 protein from plasmid with an N-terminal FLAG epitope showed only a single band in Western blot whose migration was consistent with the hypothetical unglycosylated form (Figure 5B, left panel). It was assumed that glycosylation at the predicted N-glycosylation site at position 16 (Table 1) might be ablated in the overexpressed protein, due to presence of the N-terminal epitope tag. Indeed, recombinant ORF 3 (rORF 3) protein without any tag and overexpressed in the same cells from the same vector showed both forms, identical to those observed in virus-infected cells (Figure 5B, right panel). To determine whether N-terminal glycosylation was to be expected at position 16, the membrane topology of the N-terminus was examined next.",

For confirmation, N-terminally FLAG-tagged ORF 3 protein was overexpressed in HEK-293T cells and stained by IFA using monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG tag, or alternatively, a polyclonal antibody against a peptide representing the ORF 3 protein C-terminus. As shown in Figure 6, a perinuclear distribution of fluorescence was observed with both antibodies in permeabilized cells. In non-permeabilized cells, only the anti-FLAG antibody yielded fluorescence at cell surfaces. Unfortunately, there was no complete overlap of signals from both antibodies in fully permeabilized cells in merged fluorescence pictures, most likely due to additional non-specific recognition of non-viral epitopes by the polyclonal antibody against the ORF 3 protein C-terminus. For this reason a clear intracellular localization of the C-terminus in relation to the ER/Golgi membrane could not be formally determined. However, it could be concluded that the N-terminus of the ORF 3 protein was facing towards the extracellular space.",

Only position 16 was considered a possible N-glycosylation target, as the other two positions would be located within the membrane. In a vector expressing ORF 3 protein with a C-terminal V5 tag, asparagine (N) at position 16 was changed into glutamine (Q). In-vitro translated 35S-radiolabelled proteins with and without the exchange were treated or not treated with endoglycosidase H prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. SARS-CoV M protein served as the control because it had been shown previously to be N-glycosylated exclusively at position four [34]. In-vitro translated NL63 protein ORF 3 with and without the V5 tag, but not the same protein with an N16Q exchange, showed a second band of increased molecular weight in SDS-PAGE that disappeared upon endoglycosidase H treatment (Figure 7). In the same way as for SARS-CoV M-protein, deglycosylation did not change the apparent molecular weight of the lower band, verifying absence of any further active glycosylation sites.",

After centrifugation, the gradient was divided into ten fractions and infectivity within each fraction was determined by plaque assay (Figure 8). Only fractions 4 to 7 correlating with a sucrose density of 35% to 45% contained infectious particles with a peak of 3.6 \u00d7 10E5 PFU/ml in fraction 5 (sucrose density 40-41%).

However, it is interesting to note that across all strains of hCoV-NL63 characterized so far, there are no mutations in the ORF 3 amino acid sequence [46,54]. Conservation of ORF 3 matches results by Donaldson et al., showing that virus production in human airway epithelium was reduced when the ORF 3 protein was replaced by GFP [28,46]. It has thus been suggested that protein ORF 3 might serve functions involved in viral egress which are relevant for spreading in airway epithelium but not in simpler cell culture [46].",

A range of further hypotheses can be derived from earlier investigations into protein ORF 3 functions. These include antigen decoy functions as suggested for SARS-CoV ORF 3a [55], interference with the regulation of expression of NF\u03baB-dependent cytokines [56,57] and fibrinogen [39], and finally the modulation of S protein mediated endocytosis [36] or an hypothesized down-regulation of the expression of S protein on the cell surface [58].",
