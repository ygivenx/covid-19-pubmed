In the course of the pandemic three ad hoc systems were established to capture severe respiratory cases. The first was the Pandemic Hospital Based Surveillance (Pandemische Influenza Krankenhaus-Surveillance (PIKS)) that was implemented by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) to collect data on hospital admissions diagnosed with laboratory confirmed influenza [9]. The second was a SARI-Surveillance study that was part of a hospital-based pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness study [10]. Lastly, there was enhanced surveillance of influenza during the pandemic with systematic collection of additional variables supplementary to the national regular mandatory notifications of laboratory confirmed influenza cases. For the mandatory system, it was only possible to record information on severity and risk factors according the WHO recommendations as long as the pandemic was under the scope of the Public Health Emergency of international Concern (PHEIC [11]) and an additional national pandemic notification ordinance was in force [12]. Although the information gathered on severe influenza cases and risk factors for severe course of disease were not only important in the national context but also used for global analyses [13], none of the three approaches were continued on a routine basis. Thus, the aim to establish a sustainable, timely and cost-efficient approach that could collect data during seasonal influenza epidemics and pandemics remained a priority.",

Therefore approaches using secondary data offer an attractive possibility [17]. In 2015, the RKI set up a research collaboration with a private network of hospitals in order to develop a SARI sentinel surveillance system. This used case-based data coded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) [18] and additional information on relevant procedures such as ventilation. A similar approach was used previously in the German primary care syndromic sentinel system to integrate case based ICD-10 coded reports. This led to fundamental improvements as it provided more detailed information on single ARI cases such as age, sex and single respiratory diagnosis [19, 20].",

For the analysis in this paper we only included data from the 47 hospital sites for which we had annual data for every year in the period of week 1/2012\u201320/2016 in order to illustrate the characteristics of our data over five consecutive influenza seasons. This was last updated on 27 June 2016. The number of patients covered by the sentinel sites were compared to nationwide data from the federal statistical office of Germany regarding the number of hospitals and the number of hospitalized patients in the years 2013 and 2014 [22, 23]. In the pilot phase several case definitions for SARI syndrome based on combinations of ICD-10 J-codes [18] in discharge diagnoses were selected after a literature research (Appendix, [24\u201328]) and tested with regard to their sensitivity for surveillance purposes (Fig. 1). Our dataset includes patients with any primary and secondary ICD-10 diagnosis code from J00 to J99. Thus, combinations of ICD-10 codes containing codes from other chapters are not feasible (Appendix, [25, 27]). As the focus in syndromic influenza surveillance is on acute respiratory diseases, we restricted probable cases to ICD-10 diagnosis codes from J00 to J22 and excluded ICD-10 codes from J40 to J47, as they are used for chronic lower respiratory diseases (Appendix, [24]). We described the occurrence of the ICD-10 diagnosis groups J00 - J06 (acute upper respiratory infections), J09 - J18 (influenza and pneumonia) and J20\u201322 (other acute lower respiratory infections) in the sentinel data and the age distributions within the diagnosis groups. We defined five age groups according to the outpatient sentinel system (AGI) [5, 6], which were 0\u20134 years, 5\u201314 years, 35\u201359 years and 60 years or older.\n",

This disadvantage cannot be adjusted by an additional inclusion of patients with secondary diagnosis J09 to J11 (data not shown).

Therefore, a more sensitive case definition (SCD) was found to be more appropriate in terms of estimating disease burden. SARI patients with an underlying chronic disease such as heart disease or chronic respiratory disease may have their comorbidity coded in the primary diagnosis and the acute respiratory disease in their secondary diagnosis, as the aggravation of the chronic disease could play a major role in their hospitalization [30].

Where an investigation specifically focusses on laboratory confirmed influenza, we could restrict our analysis to patients with ICD-10 diagnoses J09 and J10 (Influenza due to identified influenza virus). However, a complementary virological inpatient surveillance system could be established in the future.",

The exploratory approach gave valuable insights into the data structure, showed the importance of using different case definitions tailored to the objectives of the evaluation, and allowed the adaptation of our country specific data sources according to international recommendations. Based on the five seasons analyzed we were able to create a SARI baseline as a starting point for evaluation of severity of future influenza epidemics or pandemics. At the same time, the newly established system will allow an even more detailed analysis focusing on different subgroups of patients with specific risk factors and underlying conditions.",
