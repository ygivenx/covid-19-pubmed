The significance of the methods and data available is not only confined to the technical procedural aspects; methods and data also impact on the formulation of the specific scientific questions, their selection, and the development of hypotheses.

These are difficult methodological and conceptual demands, and the scientific and public health community could benefit from a critical overview of the available research methods and the challenges ahead.",

For most papers, a formal distinction is often impossible as the causal relationships are inferred/discussed from the patterns captured from predictive models, and vice versa the hypothetical-deductive models (e.g. driven by causal relationships), could both be able to predict a range of future scenarios.",

Most PBM are based on compartmental models, i.e. a subdivision of the entire population into relevant epidemiological categories, such as susceptible, infected, and recovered people [14]. The population dynamics of each category is usually governed by a system of non-linear differential equations (with each single equation corresponding to the rate of change of each compartment). This class of models has been extended to stochastic, spatial and age-specific models. The compartmental models in our Review included an additional compartment describing the dynamic of the pathogen population in the environment (e.g. the concentration of the pathogen in the water reservoir) which is then linked in some way to temperature and/or rainfall factors (e.g., rainfall affects the volume of the water reservoir, which determines the dilution of the pathogen and, thus, the probability of contracting the disease; temperature affects the growth and survival of many free living pathogens, such as E. coli, in the water reservoir). An infection occurs when a susceptible person comes in contact with this additional category. Infected people can excrete pathogens, and feedback into the environment compartment (included in the majority of the PBM-papers), although for some infections there is no excretion and thus no feedback into the environment (e.g. Legionella). Ten percent of PBM-papers also included person-to-person transmission via contacts between susceptible and infected persons. The cluster PBM also contained sub-clusters: \u201cExposure\u2013Response Relationship\u201d, \u201cStability Analysis\u201d, \u201cHuman Mobility\u201d, and \u201cNetwork Analysis\u201d (Fig 5).

Situations where the methods did not require comparison with real data (e.g. theoretical works requiring solely logical demonstration of theorems) were also present.",

For instance, cholera can be acquired from contamination of household water storage containers, food preparation, direct person-to-person contacts, and/or via contact with environmental reservoir with long pathogen persistence [22,23]. Identifying a potential signature for the particular pathways in the patterns of diseases is perhaps the ideal goal. In particular, to separate person-to-person transmission from other modes of disease transmissions a range of methods have been proposed, including nonlinear time series approaches linked with wavelet analysis [24] and mechanistic compartmental approaches [22,23]. Despite such efforts, isolating the contributions of person-to-person transmission on the burden of these diseases is a compelling problem not only for water-associated diseases but all infectious diseases [25,26].",

Rainfall might also dilute the concentrations of the pathogens, reducing environment-to-person transmission [28]. Compartmental models have also been used to investigate the effects of pathogen dilution due to the seasonal variation of water volume (e.g. with monsoons) and the potential interactions with other environmental drivers (e.g. temperature [29,30] and the effects of human mobility) [31].",

Fourier analysis is another approach that, from each time series of predictors, extracts a set of orthogonal data to be used as new descriptor uncorrelated variables [18,42]. Bayesian Network Analysis is another promising tool to identify statistical dependencies between multiple variables, and to separate these into those directly and indirectly dependent with one or more response variables [43]. This data-driven statistical tool produces a graphical network, whose structure describes the interdependency between variables [43,44]. In contrast with Path Analysis [45], Bayesian network analysis does not assume any causal relationships although this can be introduced by appropriate prior distribution for the structure of the graphical network. In particular, the method has been applied to investigate socio-economic determinants for diarrheal diseases and the role of weather in animal diseases [43,46]. Another method, applied to the 1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak [47], integrates population dynamic models with Profile Likelihood approach [48]. The problem of collinearity is removed by fixing the value of one or more parameters, and then estimating the remaining ones by maximizing the (log-) likelihood of the associated model; the approach is then repeated for a range of values of the fixed parameters. The method, which is suitable for a limited subset of the parameters, provides a better understanding of the relationship among different parameters.",

This introduces a further time lag, tdet, between the time when infected individual approaches the health system and the actual appropriate laboratory detection with diagnosis [60,61]. Even in a simple scenario, the temporal lag between the start of the pathway to infection (which can be challenging to define) and disease detection is a combination the time lags tres, texp, tinc, tdet.

Furthermore, external periodic perturbations (e.g. seasonality in temperature, rainfall) can resonate with the natural frequencies of the ecosystem, promoting emergency or suppression of particular strains of the pathogen [66]. Apart from the theoretical work of Koelle et al [67] which might explain the cholera strain replacement in Bangladesh due to changes in monsoon rainfall patterns, we are not aware of further research investigating evolution of water-associated pathogens in response to climate change.",

Water-associated disease outbreaks could be point-source, affecting a relatively small population. For this situation, stochastic process-based models coupled with local weather and environmental variables could be beneficial. Quantitative methodological studies applied to longer term climatic effects are limited. Extreme events, such as prolonged droughts (months or years) and heavy rain events (days or weeks), are expected to have a major impact on the dynamics of infectious diseases [74\u201377]. The papers reviewed here focused on the intensity of the events alone, not their frequency. Furthermore, there is no consensus on the definition of extreme weather events [77].",

The effects of Earth atmosphere range from short term weather events, to intermediate time periods events like ENSO, to longer term climate change.

Spatial analysis was often performed on a temporal snapshot (cross sectional study), usually to find correlation among different variables on different locations. Only a small proportion of spatial studies included temporal dynamics, for example to study the spread of cholera in a particular region due to rainfall. Longer term changes, such as land use changes, were rarely incorporated.",

The inter-connections between human health, the environment, and also animal health as advocated by the One Health holistic vision [82], are increasingly recognized. Being aware of these connections and the potential bio-physical mechanisms occurring at different spatio-temporal scales is crucial to separate out the multiple transmission pathways, to understand and quantify the different sources of the temporal lag, and to deal with collinearity. Incorporating information on human behaviour and socio-economic factors can help to reduce reporting bias, and improve understanding of the potential effect on infectious diseases of anthropogenic climate change and interventions.",

The location of the diagnostic laboratories, or the patient residences, could be used to link cases to local weather parameters supplied by the UK Met Office in a confidential manner.

This exercise provides a family of curves of the rates of infection, which are function of the test variable and conditioned to all other fixed predictors.

According to this conceptual scheme, a disease-free situation is the combination of negligible pathogen population in, and/or negligible exposure of susceptible individuals to, the pathogen reservoir. Infections arise from increased interactions of exposed susceptibles with the pathogen reservoir. This can be caused by a growth in the pathogen population (driven, for example, by temperature) and/or larger exposure to the pathogen. An increase in the exposure can be directly or indirectly driven by meteorological/climate variables (e.g. high temperature increasing the risk of drinking contaminated water), environmental causes (e.g. poor water drainage management due to land use), and behavioural and/or socio-economic factors (e.g. recreational activity in unclean water).
