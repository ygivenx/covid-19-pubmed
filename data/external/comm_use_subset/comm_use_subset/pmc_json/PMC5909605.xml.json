            "text": "Emergency physicians are the front-line health care workers at highest risk of exposure to airborne and aerosolized infectious hazards during invasive and emergency procedures, such as endotracheal intubation [1]. Various devices and guidelines have been developed and used clinically to minimize the risk of exposure. For example, many health care organizations recommend use of an N95 filtering facepiece respirator [2\u20134]. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health also ranks the protective performance of the various N95 respirators according to their filtering efficiency [5,6]. Unfortunately, emergency physicians can still be exposed to infectious hazards while wearing certified respirators if the respirator is not correctly fitted to the wearer\u2019s face [7]. One study revealed that inward leakage of contaminants because of an incomplete face seal was 3\u20135-fold greater than that via penetration of the filter itself [8]. Furthermore, movement of the head can affect the fit of the respirator if there is a change in the relative positions of the face and the respirator, which can potentially cause leaks in the face seal [9,10]. A direct laryngoscope is used as a first-line airway device during endotracheal intubation [11,12]. Emergency physicians must approach the patient\u2019s mouth and manipulate the airway structures to expose the vocal cords. The risk of infection can increase during endotracheal intubation using a direct laryngoscope as a result of aerosolized hazards generated during coughing and movement during intubation [13\u201315]. Movement during endotracheal intubation using a direct laryngoscope has been reported to influence the protective performance of respirators [16]. The GlideScope\u00ae (GVL; Verathon, Bothell, WA, USA) has a hyperangulated blade, the tip of which is equipped with a camera. The i-gel\u00ae (IGEL; Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, UK) is a single-use supraglottic airway device comprising a soft gel-like cuffless mask, a narrow-bore gastric drain tube, and an integral bite block. No movement is needed to expose the vocal cords when intubations are performed using the GVL or IGEL. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the effect of movement during endotracheal intubation using the various types of airway devices on the protective performance of respirators. The aim of this study was to determine whether different types of airway devices affect the protection afforded by a respirator during endotracheal intubation.",

Subjects were excluded if they had lung disease, high blood pressure (i.e., systolic >160 mmHg, diastolic >95 mmHg), a wrist disorder, or low back pain. All participants in the study signed a written consent form before inclusion. The sample size was calculated based on a pilot study of differences in the fit factor values between two N95 respirators during intubation using three different types of airway device. In that study, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) fit factor values were 128.71 \u00b1 41.07 for the Macintosh laryngoscope, 170.27 \u00b1 39.25 for the GVL, and 161.46 \u00b1 38.43 for the IGEL during intubations. The sample size was calculated using G-power 3.1.2\u00ae (Heine Heinrich University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany). Sample size had been calculated based on the assumption of use F tests ANOVA: Repeated measures, between factors. An alpha error was 0.05, a power was 0.8 and effect size f was 0.4515279. While allowing for a 10% dropout rate, we estimated that 26 subjects would be needed.",

These two respirators are supplied by a leading manufacturer and were used in emergency medical centers during the Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic in Korea in 2015. The quantitative fit test for the N95 respirators was performed using the PortaCount\u00ae Plus (TSI Inc, St. Paul, MN, USA; Fig 1). This device is equipped with two sampling tubes. One sampling tube is exposed to the atmosphere to measure the ambient particle concentration and the other is connected to the respirator to measure the particles therein. The other end of each sampling tube is connected to the PortaCount Plus. The fit factor value is calculated as the ratio of the concentration of particles in the air outside the respirator to the concentration of particles that have leaked into the respirator. The fit factor has a maximum value of 200, and a value >100 indicates that the respirator has passed a quantitative fit test [17]. The weight of the tube is supported by a wire placed around the operator\u2019s neck.",

Twenty-six physicians were enrolled and randomly allocated to one of three groups according to the type of airway device used first and second (www.random.org; Fig 2). All study participants were required to refrain from smoking, eating, chewing gum, and drinking (except for still water) for at least 30 minutes before starting the quantitative fit test. This simulation trial was performed in a triage room (24.3 m3) without air conditioning in one emergency medical center. We used a particle generator (TSI, model 8026) to generate a sodium chloride aerosol to ensure that the ambient air contained at least 100 particles in the correct size range per milliliter. All study participants were assigned respirators based on their face and lip length measurements, as recommended by the Los Alamos National Laboratory [18]. Before starting the trials, the subjects were allowed to practice applying each type of N95 respirator and received brief education about the wearing of these respirators by reading the infection control manuals. Ten minutes before starting the trials, they were allowed to practice intubations with each of the three airway devices without wearing the respirator to familiarize themselves with the Laerdal airway management trainer. The fit factor value for each type of N95 respirator was measured in three simulation scenarios, i.e., using the Macintosh laryngoscope, the GVL, and the IGEL. Finally, each subject performed a series of 6 quantitative mask fit tests. Before applying the N95 respirator, one sampling tube was connected to a probe inserted into the respirator without deforming the shape of the respirator. An interval of 10 minutes was allowed before changing the type of simulation scenario and an interval of about 5 minutes was allowed before changing the type of N95 respirator used. A seal check was performed before each change of simulation scenario or respirator.",

Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for continuous variables when comparing the fit factor values for cup-type and fold-type N95 respirators when intubating using each type of airway device. A P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",

However, only N95 filters were used in this study, and leakage via the face seal is the major source of particle penetration when using a respirator [8]. In this context, fold-type respirators have a flexible sealing surface whereas the cup-type respirators do not, so users may be able to manipulate the fold-type respirator more easily to achieve a better face seal. However, fold-type and cup-type respirators have similar face seal areas [26]. Interestingly, the nosepiece of a respirator helps to prevent leak via the face seal in the nasal area, where leaks are frequently detected [27]. In this study, the nosepiece of the fold-type respirator was freely flexible but that of the cup-type respirator was not; this difference may have contributed to the difference in the amount of leak between the two types of respirator. For example, facepiece respirators are equipped with nonadjustable head straps for face sealing, and the cup-type respirators have head straps that are longer, wider, and thicker than the fold-type and valve-type respirators [26]. Moreover, the pressure generated by the head straps could influence the fit of the respirator. For example, Niezoda et al. found that fold-type and cup-type respirators had similar fit factor values at the lower seal pressure generated by the head strap [26]. Therefore, the characteristics of the respirator, i.e., the shape of the sealing surface, type of nosepiece, type of head strap apparatus, and type of valve used to reduce exhalation resistance, could influence the final fit of the respirator.",

Rebmann et al. reported that although long-term use of a respirator did not result in a clinically relevant physiologic burden for the wearer, it was associated with many subjective symptoms [28]. Thus, compliance may be determined by selection of a respirator that is comfortable for the wearer. In this context, low-pressure facial seal areas are more comfortable to wear but are prone to leakage, whereas high-pressure facial seal areas cause discomfort that negatively affects wearer compliance [26]. Compared with fold-type respirators, cup-type respirators are more rigid and include a head strap that generates higher pressure, which could increase facial discomfort.",
