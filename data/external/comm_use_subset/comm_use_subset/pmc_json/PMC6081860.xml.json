            "text": "Macrophages are the main host cell supporting FIPV replication in vivo [1]. It is therefore important to study how FIPV infected macrophages respond to infection, because they also mediate the resultant immune/inflammatory responses. FIPV replication appears to be very cell associated throughout the disease course and there appears to be no discernable cell-free viremia [1]. However, it appears that virus may spread to distant sites within these cells, as similar appearing infected macrophages dominate in organs such as the brain [2, 3]. Attempts to mimic this infection in vitro have relied heavily on monocyte/macrophage cultures derived from PBMC rather than on actual peritoneal-type macrophages. Although monocyte cultures internalize FIPV much more efficiently than CRFK cells [4], virus replication in such cultures tends to be low and is not sustained in a chronic state as in nature. It is unlikely that the interaction between FIPV and macrophages can be easily mimicked by in vitro cell culture systems using other cell types.",

The premise was that peritoneal cell populations would contain macrophages and that they would be the sole infected cell type.

The morphology of the strongly staining cells was characteristic for activated macrophages, i.e., they were large and highly vacuolated (Figure 1G). Apoptosis in the omentum was limited to large highly vacuolated macrophages and TUNEL stained lymphocytes and neutrophils were sparse even though there was an extensive lymphocytic/neutrophilic infiltrate. Therefore, the spleen was also examined by IHC and TUNEL staining. Unlike the omentum, lymphoid cells were arranged in a more orchestrated (reactive) manner around existing structures such as germinal centers and marginal zones. Apoptotic cells were concentrated in the germinal centers of splenic lymphoid follicles (Figures 2A and B). These were presumably B cells based on IHC. This response may have been related or unrelated to the FIPV infection. Some unidentified cells in the marginal zones were faintly stained by TUNEL.",

The present study used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in peritoneal cells from four healthy cats with gene expression from peritoneal cells of 11 cats that had been experimentally infected with non-tissue culture adapted serotype I FIPV, which more closely paralleled the natural infection. The present study also identified a greater number of significantly dysregulated genes (5621), with many of them expressed at levels 200-fold higher (956) or lower (1589) in FIPV infected versus normal peritoneal cells.",

Peritoneal cells were not purified, because any purification method would likely cause significant changes in differential gene expression profiles. This lack of purity was not seen as a problem, as peritoneal cells collected from both healthy and diseased cats contained a predominance of macrophage-type cells. Eosinophils were present in the normal peritoneal exudate cell population but made no contribution whatsoever to the cells in peritoneal exudate from cats with FIP. Neutrophils were present in both populations but did not appear grossly activated in either situation in stained smears. Finally, the differentially expressed genes were associated mainly with macrophage type cells and not with neutrophils. Therefore, the assumption was that the present differential gene expression profiles reflected primarily macrophage-type cells.",

Therefore, some researchers believe that mRNA levels cannot be used as surrogates for corresponding protein levels without verification. Despite the inconsistencies, researchers still see value in RNA-seq analyses, especially when translated proteins have a short half-life and the genetic complexity of the system being studied is low [27]. It appears that the half-life of cytokines generated by infected/activated macrophages in this experimental FIPV infection model is very short. Fever and lymphopenia appear suddenly with the onset of peritonitis [1] and disappear within hours of virus inhibition using a potent anti-viral drug [12]. However, the magnitude and complexity of cytokine responses observed in the present study appears high rather than low.",

A more focused interpretation of the data was obtained from functional gene pathways, especially those identified by InnateDB, Qiagen, and KEGG databases. Only three InnateDB pathways were significantly under-expressed, all related to normal cellular functions, while 18 pathways were over-expressed. Four of the most significant up-regulated pathways were associated with microbe recognition\u2014toll-like receptor signaling, RIG-I-like receptor signaling, cytosolic DNA-sensing and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. Recognition of a foreign invasion, and in this case by an RNA virus, is the essential first step in the initiation of an immune and/or inflammatory response. It is also noteworthy that five of the eighteen most significantly upregulated InnateDB pathways were associated with infectious agents such as hepatitis C virus (another RNA virus), leishmaniasis, American and African trypanosomiasis, and toxoplasmosis. These diseases are all associated with pathogens of macrophages (except for hepatitis C virus) that result in persistent intracellular infections and disease. FIPV is the only RNA virus known to cause granulomatous lesions that mirror those of classic non-viral macrophage pathogens [28, 29] and it is understandable why systemic feline mycobacteriosis is nearest in clinical and pathologic features to FIP [30]. It is also noteworthy that two InnateDB pathways resembled those associated with graft versus host disease and allograft rejection, while two other pathways were shared with type I diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis. These conditions all involved problems in differentiating self from non-self that lead to inflammation. Reasons for upregulation of the osteoclast differentiation pathway was more difficult to understand.",

M1 (killer) macrophages are activated by LPS and IFN-gamma, and secrete high levels of IL12 and low levels of IL10. This pattern was confirmed by mRNA expression with IL10 mRNA being down-regulated and IL12 mRNA upregulated. Although brief expression of mRNAs associated with M1 macrophages may be beneficial, excessive and/or prolonged M1 polarization can lead to pathogen-induced inflammation rather than immunity [31].

Therefore, it was not surprising that staining for N protein was concentrated in the large multi-vacuolated cells. In contrast, polyclonal antibody used with DIFA demonstrated intracellular viral proteins in macrophages with various morphology, which suggesting they are at different stages of differentiation and infection. A relationship between cell death and high levels of intracellular Mycobacteria tuberculosis has also been described [32]. In this scenario, more immature and less virus-laden peritoneal monocyte/macrophages fail to undergo programmed cell death, while older virus laden cells are specifically targeted for destruction by a mechanism distinct from classic apoptosis [35]. Such a process assures persistence of infected cells, while allowing for efficient dissemination of the pathogen [36].",

MHC I molecules have been detected on the cell surfaces of infected macrophages from cats with naturally-occurring FIP [37], indicating that the FLAI-K proteins were also produced in the present cats. The function of FLAI-K is to present immunogenic FIPV peptides to CD8+ T cells, which might be expected to result ultimately in the destruction of infected monocyte/macrophages. This poses a paradox, because most of the monocyte/macrophages from cats in this study were not apoptotic. However, viral antigens have not been detected on the membranes of macrophages from cats with naturally-occurring FIP [37].

[45] also found that blocking of DC-SIGN inhibited binding of serotype I FIPV to feline monocyte cultures by one-third and infection by 80%. However, DC-SIGN mRNA was significantly under-expressed in the peritoneal exudate cells from cats with FIP, making it an unlikely receptor for in vivo infection. A related lectin, L-SIGN (CD209L), has been shown to be the receptor for the closely related human coronavirus 229E [47]. L-SIGN is expressed at high levels by hepatic cells [48] and is a high affinity receptor for hepatitis C virus [48]. An mRNA for L-SIGN was not detected in the present study. Likewise, the mRNA for ACE2 was also not detected, while the mRNA for dipeptidyl peptidase 4 was upregulated, but below the level of the study cutoff of plus or minus Log2FC. The down-regulation of DC-SIGN mRNA was unexpected, as it functions as an attachment receptor for enveloped viruses such as hepatitis C virus [48] by a process known as cis-infection. Trans-infection of dendritic cells by cytomegalovirus, whereby virus infection goes from one cell type to another, has also been associated with DC-SIGN [49]. HIV-1 also uses DC-SIGN and L-SIGN expressed by antigen presenting cells for its delivery to target cells such as CD4+ lymphocytes by trans-infection [50]. DC-SIGN may also be important in the capture and internalization of these pathogens for processing and antigen presentation and not merely replication [51].",

            "text": "Is there possible significance for the unexpected and highly significant down-regulation of DC-SIGN expression by peritoneal cells from FIPV infected cats? A common feature of the pathogens mentioned above is that they all can cause chronic infections that last a lifetime. This persistence has been linked to how DC- and L-SIGN and pathogen interact. Hepatis C virus can misuse DC- and L-SIGN by certain mechanisms to escape lysosomal degradation [52]. This \u201cmisuse\u201d of DC-SIGN is thought to circumvent antigen processing or alter TLR-mediated signaling and skew immune responses towards Th2 rather than Th1 [53]. A Th2 type immune response to infection with S. mansoni is associated with its persistence and soluble carbohydrate egg antigens can cause a switch towards a Th2-cell-mediated immune response [54]. Mycobacteria may also target DC-SIGN to suppress DC function and modulate immune responses [55]. Therefore, the paradoxical down-regulation of DC-SIGN in FIPV infected macrophages may be one explanation for FIPV persistence in those cats that fail to contain the virus within the first few days following infection [1].",

They are generally considered to be low-affinity receptors for Ig in immune complexes. Fc receptors have been shown to be important regulators of immune responses [56]. Although there are several Fc receptors, Fc\u03b3RIIIA (CD16a) was the only Fc receptor gene that was both detected and over-expressed to a noticeable level in peritoneal exudate cells from cats with FIP. The likely sources of Fc\u03b3RIIIA mRNA were NK cells, monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils. Fc\u03b3RIIIA is the receptor on NK cells responsible for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). An important, and yet to be confirmed role for Fc\u03b3RIIIA, is as a means for macrophage infection by FIPV. There is evidence that FIPV antibody binding is involved in the internalization of FIPV by macrophages [6] and that this process involves an Fc-type receptor [7] as shown for flaviviruses [57].",

            "text": "The prevailing belief is that cellular immunity is key for FIPV immunity [28, 58] and that antibodies are disease promoting [8, 28]. It is also widely believed that innate host defenses are crucial in the initial control of an infection but that they are insufficient for ultimate pathogen clearance [59]. It follows that survival of pathogens in macrophages is due to inhibition of adaptive (presumably cellular) immunity [60]. However, evidence that cellular immunity is crucial for preventing FIP is sparse and largely indirect. PBMC or whole blood cultures from FIPV immune cats proliferate in response to live virus exposure in vitro [57] and produce IFN\u03b3 in response to T cell epitopes of the viral N protein [61]. Delayed-type hypersensitivity responses can be elicited in the palpebral mucosa [58] or skin [62] with FIPV antigen in immune cats. The occurrence of FIP is also much higher in FECV enzootic cats naturally infected with feline leukemia virus, a known T cell immunosuppressive retrovirus [63]. The most convincing evidence for the role of cellular immunity comes from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection. MHV, like FECV/FIPV, is a coronavirus that exists in enteric (wildtype) and systemic (mutated by laboratory passage) biotypes [64]. Infection of IFN\u03b3 deficient mice with systemic MHV caused a disease virtually identical to FIP [65]. It is also noteworthy that enteric MHV infection of B cell deficient mice causes a more prolonged intestinal infection, while the same virus in T cell deficient mice causes an FIP-like disease like what occurs when systemic MHV is inoculated into IFN\u03b3 deficient mice [66]. This suggests that FECV infection is controlled more by B-cell immunity, while FIPV infection is controlled by T-cell immunity.",

On gross analysis, Th1 pathway genes appeared to have a higher level of over-expression than those in the Th2 pathway. However, viruses, bacteria and TLR ligands interact with antigen presenting cells and enter the Th1 differentiation pathway through DLL and it is noteworthy that DLL1 was significantly down-regulated as was the receptor NOTCH3. Evidence that favored Th2 pathway activation was not apparent from analysis of KEGG selected genes. Deficient Th2 associated polarization became less obvious when IL6, CD40, BAFF and Blimp-1 (PRDM1) genes were added to the list of KEGG Th2 differentiation genes. The mRNAs for all four of these genes were expressed at very high levels in peritoneal exudate cells from cats with FIP, confirming earlier studies of Takano et al. [68]. IL6 type cytokines are involved in inflammation and B cell maturation and inhibit IFN\u03b3 responses. CD40L expressed by T cells can provide signals to B cells that induce proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, antibody secretion and prevention of apoptosis during B cell differentiation [67]. BAFF is expressed in B cell lineage cells and plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of B cells [69]. Blimp-1 (PDMR1) controls many functions of plasma cells, including migration and adhesion of plasmablasts, silencing B-cell specific gene expression associated with antigen presentation and class-switch recombination, and activating genes involved in antibody secretion [70].",
