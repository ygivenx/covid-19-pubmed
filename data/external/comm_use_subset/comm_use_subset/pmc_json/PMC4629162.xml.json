The 150-\u03bcm-deep polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel was fabricated using conventional soft-lithography processes38. The micro-optofluidic platform is based on single-layer PDMS channel and has four inlets (one sample inlet, one dye inlet, and two hydraulic focusing sheath inlets), and one outlet for waste. It consists of four main components: sample and dye inlets, a mixing region, a hydraulic focusing zone, and a sample optofluidic detection component (see Fig. S1). We used SYTO82 dye (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 541 nm and an emission wavelength of 560 nm for nuclear staining of live cells in the microfluidic mixing zone. SYTO82 provides cell-permeant nucleic acid staining and exhibits low intrinsic fluorescence in cell-free systems, with marked enhancement upon binding to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA)3940. Following injection of the sample and dye using a syringe pump (KDS200; KD Scientific Inc., Holliston, MA, USA), the two fluids mixed rapidly at the entrance to the mixing zone.",

The Navier\u2013Stokes equations were solved with Fick\u2019s law of diffusion to describe the dynamics and homogenization of the mixing process in the channel. Figure 1 (B-1,B-2) show the results of the CFD simulations and optical micrographs of the mixing of the sample and dye in the micro-mixer part. The numerical simulations show that the mixing of the two fluids was complete approximately 0.1\u20130.4 mm from the entrance of mixing zone with flow rate conditions for each fluid in the range 2.5\u201325 \u03bcL/h (simulation duration, ~72\u2013180 ms) (Fig. S2). The mixing zone was 136.8 mm long and 50 \u03bcm wide. The residence time for mixing (and hence for the reaction between the sample and dye) was in the range 25\u2013246 s for total flow rates in the range 5\u201350 \u03bcL/h. After passing through the mixing zone, the mixed sample fluid was focused horizontally using a dual sheath flow with sterilized distilled water (SDW) in the hydraulic focusing component (see Fig. 1 (A)). The focused core flow was 7.5 \u03bcm wide, which is one-twentieth the width of the channel. This minimized variation in the optical signals among locations in the particle detection zone30.",

A diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and an output power of 2.0 mW (CNI laser, Changchun, China) was coupled with a single-mode optical fiber (core diameter: 3.5 \u03bcm, cladding diameter: 125 \u03bcm). The laser beam was focused on the core fluid using an objective lens (RMS20x-PF; 20x/0.5; Thorlabs) located beneath the microfluidic channel (~7 \u03bcm beam spot size at full-width half-maximum). A highly sensitive multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) (C10507-11-50U; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) module was used to detect the SC and FL signals from the target particles. The particle FL was collected using the objective lens, and entered the MPPC via the optical long-pass filter and focusing lens. To bring the SC light from the particles, multi-mode optical fiber with a core diameter of 105 \u03bcm and a cladding diameter of 125 \u03bcm (Thorlabs) was carefully inserted into the channel with the axis of the fiber at 90\u00b0 to the direction of flow, and linked to the MPPC.",

The FLPSL particle suspension (~1.45 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL) was injected into sample inlet. The ratio of the flow rate of the FLPSL particle suspension to that of the SDW was 1:19 in the narrow core region (which had dimensions of 7.5 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm). As the flow velocity increased from 1.42 to 14.3 mm/s, the frequency of the particle SC and FL signals increased in proportion to the particle flow velocity, and the average intensity of the measured SC and FL signals (SC/FL) decreased from ~140 arbitrary unit (a.u.)/~60 a.u. to ~46 a.u./~30 a.u., respectively (Fig. 2 (A)). This is attributed to the decreased photon integration time of the photodetector with decreasing residence time of the particles in the detection zone of microchannel41. Figure 2 (B) shows that the event rate (i.e., number of counts per second) of the particle SC and FL signals followed a linear relationship with the particle flow velocity; for FL we have y = 1.04x + 0.37, with r2 = 0.996, and for SC we have y = 1.07x + 0.52, with r2 = 0.998. The index of coincidence between the total frequencies of particle SC and FL signals was ~96.5% over the entire range of particle flow velocities. McClain et al. reported that only ~5% of the particle SC signals were unaccompanied by coincident FL signals, which was attributed to unresolved FL peaks due to the relatively low signal intensity36. When the number of counts of the particle SC and FL signals are plotted as histograms as a function of the signal intensity, both sets of signals form Gaussian-like distributions, as shown in Fig. S3. The variation in the intensity results from variations in the particle size and particle position in the detection zone. As expected, the particle SC signal was significantly stronger than the FL signal.",

The average SC/FL signal intensity ratios were ~555/240 for E. coli, ~565/227 for B. subtilis, and ~433/142 for S. epidermidis. Because of the size of these bacteria (i.e., 0.5 \u2013 1.6 \u03bcm), they may be considered to lie within the Mie scattering regime, and the intensity of the SC signals may be assumed to be proportional to the cross-sectional area of particles36. In the same manner, the FL signal intensity increased proportionally with the size of the bacteria because larger particles have a higher concentration of nucleic-acid fluorescent dye3336. The particle number concentration was determined based on the frequency data for the SC and FL signals. Table 2 lists the SC signal concentration, which corresponds to the total particle number concentration. This was higher than the FL signal concentration, which corresponds to the total concentration of microorganisms. The difference between the total particle count (SC signals) and the total bacterial concentration (FL signals) was ~7% for E. coli, ~16% for B. subtilis, and ~23% for S. epidermidis. It follows that the sample included other particles; i.e., non-microorganism particles or impurities, such as non-dyed particles or small debris.",

Photobleaching of fluorophores may occur during cell counting via conventional fluorescence microscopy, which results in a reduction in the fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, the low signal-to-noise ratio in the imaging process may lead to underestimation of the number of cells. An inappropriate image threshold intensity setting is required to discriminate fluorescence particles from the background, and this may exclude particles that either have a low fluorescence intensity or are slightly out of focus43. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the total concentration of particles with sizes of less than 1 \u03bcm is limited by the resolution and the field of view of bright-field microscopy. As shown in Figure 5 (B), the colony counting method resulted in the lowest cell concentration of the three methods. The colony counting method measures only culturable cells in the medium.
