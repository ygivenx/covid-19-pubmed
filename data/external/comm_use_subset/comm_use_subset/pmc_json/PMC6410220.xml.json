These discrepancies may be due to the complexity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) pathogenesis in general, making it difficult to link cases of feline CKD to only one specific trigger [17]. In some cats, feline morbilliviruses may induce a persistent infection of the urinary tract [8]. So far it is not clear whether an acute or chronic infection can cause or support the development of CKD. During our current studies an unknown feline paramyxovirus was detected in urine samples from domestic cats [13]. Although this virus was initially linked to FeMV strains from Japan, whole genome sequencing revealed a different genotype of FeMV, tentatively named feline morbillivirus genotype 2 (FeMV-GT2). Here we show that the FeMV-GT2-Gordon strain replicates in primary feline epithelial cells from different organs and is able to infect primary feline T and B cells, as well as monocytes in vitro. We demonstrate that FeMV-GT2 readily infects feline organotypic brain slice cultures with cells of the cerebrum and cerebellum being comparably susceptible. ",

The results revealed that all three cell lines were susceptible to FeMV-GT2 with LLC-MK2 cells being more permissive in comparison to Vero and CrFK cells. These findings were also confirmed by immunofluorescence staining targeting the FeMV-GT2-nucleoprotein (Figure 1). No visible CPE was induced on any tested cell line. Initial virus titer on LLC-MK2 cells was low at passage no. 3 (3 \u00d7 103 TCID50/mL), but could be enhanced to 1 \u00d7 105 TCID50/mL after passage no. 9.

CrFK, Vero, MARC-145 and BHK-21 were also susceptible, but to a lesser extent (Table 2). To exclude the possibility that these observations were the result of an adaption phenomenon from the three passages on LLC-MK2 cells, the original urine sample from \u2018Gordon\u2019 was applied to the selected cell lines and analyzed for the permissiveness regarding FeMV-GT2. No differences between the urine sample and the LLC-MK2-adapted FeMV-GT2-Gordon strain were observed. Due to the better growth and the easier maintenance of LLC-MK2 cells in comparison to the Fcwf-4 cell line, all further FeMV-GT2 strains were isolated and propagated on the former cell line. In contrast to other known morbilliviruses, no cytopathic effects became apparent on any of the FeMV-GT2-susceptible cell lines (tested until passage number five).",

Nucleotide sequences from strains were 99.2% identical, differing in only 130 nucleotides mainly located in the non-coding regions of the genome. The genome organization of FeMV-GT2 resembled that of classical FeMV strains, encoding six (3\u2032-N-P/V/C-M-F-H-L-5\u2032) open reading frames (ORFs), typical for other morbilliviruses.

Isolated cells represented a mixture (approximately 50%:50%) of cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells and vimentin-positive non-epithelial cells. An in-depth analysis further showed that cells also expressed the renal collecting duct cell marker aquaporin-2 [27], the distal tubulus cell marker calbindin D28K [28] and the proximal tubulus cell marker alkaline phosphatase [29]. Hence, it was concluded that the isolated primary feline kidney cells express the terminal differentiation markers also present in na\u00efve tissues and are therefore suitable for in vitro infection experiments.

Feline morbilliviruses (FeMV) were found to be clearly distinguishable from the classical morbilliviruses, such as CDV or MeV based on phylogenetic analyses [14,15] despite the fact that the size and organization of their genome reflects properties as defined for the genus morbilliviruses. Here, we describe a second morbillivirus isolated from domestic cats, tentatively named feline morbillivirus genotype 2 (FeMV-GT2). This virus grouped together with previously described feline morbilliviruses (FeMV), but could be separated from these isolates based on whole genome sequences (Figure 3). Amino acid identities between the FeMV-GT2 and the FeMV structural proteins ranged between 75\u201392%. These differences are comparable to the species cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) where currently five strains from different animal species exhibit a similar genetic diversity as identified for FeMV and FeMV-GT2 in our study [31]. In addition, electron microscopy revealed a similar morphology of the FeMV-GT2 particle as described for FeMV [14] and other morbilliviruses. We observed a wider ribonucleocapsid protein (RNP) in FeMV-GT2 preparations, but this could be due to a preparation or staining artefact, but may also be an intrinsic feature of feline morbilliviruses. Therefore, we provisional propose that FeMV-GT2 should be considered as a different genotype of FeMV. To clarify the taxonomic status of FeMV-GT2 more information about the genetic diversity of circulating strains is needed and should be addressed to future studies.",

Urine samples were collected as part of the routine clinical work and for practical reasons they were stored for some weeks at -20 \u00b0C before RNA extraction could be performed. Thus, RNA degradation may have occurred influencing the sensitivity of the PCR analysis. Two cats were FeMV-GT2-positive for several months till years, with virus shedding in their urine emphasizing that the virus is able to establish persistent infections. This is in accordance with published data about prolonged FeMV-infections in domestic cats [8,13,32]. Interestingly, virus secretion within the urine in two persistently infected cats (\u2018Gordon\u2019 and \u2018TV25\u2019, Table 1) continued despite high titers of FeMV-GT2-specific neutralizing antibodies in the blood. This is in contrast to other morbillivirus infections were neutralizing antibody titers higher than 32 or 120 prevent virus secretion in CDV [33] and MeV [34], respectively. The reason for this phenomenon remains speculative at the moment, but can be the result of FeMV-GT2 replication in epithelial cells of the kidney, FeMV-GT2 escape mutants or impaired T-cell response in infected animals.

Whether this virus location is also reflected in natural infections needs to be clarified by (immune)-histopathology in diseased or experimentally infected cats. Feline urinary bladder epithelial cells were significantly less susceptible to FeMV-GT2. The reproducibility of the results excludes the possibility that this observation was caused by the cat\u2019s individual medical histories. Data generated from in vitro infection experiments might, however, differ from the in vivo situation. The cultivation medium used for primary kidney cells, for instance, might influence the expression of terminal differentiation markers and serial passaging of these cells can induce dedifferentiation of primary distal renal tubular cells [38]. Equally, primary bladder epithelial cells might not display their physiological surface markers, so-called uroplakins, when cultured in vitro [39]. Therefore, it is possible that the FeMV-GT2 tissue tropism observed in our in vitro experiments differs from the in vivo conditions. On the other hand, FeMV was shown to replicate in renal tubular cells in naturally infected cats [6,15,40], supporting our results for a kidney-associated FeMV-GT2 replication. ",

This implicates that viremia is present\u2014if at all\u2014only for a short period of time. This observation is supported by previous investigations in FeMV-infected cats where viremia was not detectable in the vast majority of blood samples [6,7,9]. There is only one report from a shelter in Thailand that found FeMV to be present in the blood of animals [11]. Currently, the mode of transmission of feline morbilliviruses is unknown. Related viruses (e.g. canine distemper and measles virus) establish infections in their susceptible hosts by transmission via the oro-nasal route. Following an initial replication in resident immune cells (tissue macrophages or dendritic cells) these viruses infect different lymphocyte subtypes resulting in a short-term viremic state [37]. Here we show that FeMV-GT2 can infect several cells of the immune system in the peripheral blood including CD4+ T cells, B cells, monocytes and to a significantly lesser extent CD8+ T cells. Feline PBMC were shown to be susceptible to FeMV-GT2 infection without prior stimulation supporting the assumption that the in vitro results reflect the in vivo situation. Percentage and identity of FeMV-GT2-positive immune cells resemble findings from in vivo infection experiments with CDV in a ferret model [41]. Similar results were also observed in a macaque model of MeV-infections [42]. Recently it was also shown that FeMV can be detected in the spleen and lymph nodes in naturally infected cats [40]. ",

Alongside infections of the lung, CDV and MeV are able to infect and induce severe damage to the brain under certain circumstances [37]. Although the mechanism of how CDV and MeV enter the brain is not completely understood, a leukocyte-associated virus transport as a source of hematogenous brain infections is hypothesized [37]. Our in vitro findings show that such a mechanism might also be responsible for the spread of FeMV-GT2 in the body of affected animals as brain slice cultures were susceptible to the FeMV-GT2-Gordon strain. Although the specific nature of the affected cell types could not be determined definitely, it is likely that neurons are a target as GFAP-positive cells (representing glia cells) were found to be FeMV-GT2-negative in our in vitro experiments. These data revealed that FeMV-GT2 is able to infect feline brain cells integrated into a physiological tissue environment. However, this needs further investigation in controlled animal infection experiments. ",

It is well known that Vero-adapted MeV strains acquired mutations leading to the usage of CD46 as a viral entry receptor which is not a characteristic of MeV wild type strains [43]. The possibility that FeMV-GT2 have gained mutations might explain our observation that viral titer increased about 100-fold on LLC-MK2 cells between consecutive passages. On the other hand, titers remained low in CrFK, Vero and BHK-21 cells independent from the number of blind passages. Therefore, raising titers in the first passages of LLC-MK2 cells can also be addressed to a low concentration of augmentable virus in urine samples. In depth sequencing approaches of FeMV-GT2-positive urine samples and the respective cell culture adapted viral isolates will help to interpret our in vitro findings in the context of viral pathogenesis and should be conducted in future studies.

Although the aforementioned organs are well known as infections sites for CDV and MeV [37], they have not been characterized as target tissues for FeMV in the past. Until recently, the feline kidney was focused on being the target of feline morbilliviruses [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. Our data clearly demonstrate that FeMV-GT2 can infect primary cells obtained from other organs and that the pathologic potential of FeMV and FeMV-GT2 might currently be underestimated. Hence, further research is needed to elucidate the impact of feline morbilliviruses on animal health, especially for domestic cats. ",
