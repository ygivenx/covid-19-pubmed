In 2012, we reported the discovery of a PBV, named otarine PBV (Ot-PBV), in a California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) in Hong Kong, which was the first PBV reported in a marine mammal (Woo et al., 2012). Recently, we have also described the first discovery and a diversity of PBVs in dromedary camels from the Middle East (Woo et al., 2014b).",

Segment 1 contains the capsid gene and another open reading frame which encodes for a putative protein of unknown function, whereas segment 2 contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (Wakuda et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2012). By sequence and phylogenetic analyses, PBVs are classified into genogroups I and II based on the RdRp gene sequence (Rosen et al., 2000; Wakuda et al., 2005). Recently, it has also been reported that novel genogroups of PBVs have been detected in human and environmental samples (Smits et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). As of December 31 2015, 931 PBV nucleotide sequences have been submitted to GenBank. However, only nine are complete/near-complete segment 1 sequences and 21 are complete/near-complete segment 2 sequences. Among these nine complete/near-complete segment 1 and 21 complete/near-complete segment 2 sequences, 18 are genogroup I sequences.",

All specimens of rabbits were collected from live food animal markets in Guangzhou, China, in October 2007. Rectal swabs were collected using procedures described previously (Lau et al., 2005). All fecal samples of marine mammals, including Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, California sea lions and harbor seals, were collected by veterinary surgeons of the Ocean Park in HKSAR (Woo et al., 2014a). A total of 791 samples collected over a 75-month period (October 2007 to December 2013) from 157 bats, 52 monkeys, 100 pigs, 58 cats, 58 dogs, 50 cattle, 106 rabbits, 95 horses, 46 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, 54 California sea lions, and 15 harbor seals were tested (Table 1).",

Multiple alignments of the sequences of these six ORFs showed that they formed three groups that were not homologous to each other, with three ORFs belonging to the first group, two ORFs to the second group and one ORF to the third group (Figure 2). In the first group, the three ORFs showed 97.6\u201399.4% nucleotide identities among each other. In the second group, the two ORFs showed 100% nucleotide identity. Sequence analysis of these ORFs did not reveal any significant sequence homology to other proteins in the GenBank database.

Overall, samples positive for PBV were collected mainly in 2008 and 2009. Among these positive results, most clades of segment 1 and segment 2 were observed in samples from either 2008 or 2009, while only segment 1 clades C3 and C4 and segment 2 clade R1 were present in samples from both 2008 and 2009.

            "text": "A high diversity of PBVs was observed in a variety of terrestrial and marine mammals. Despite the relatively high evolutionary rate of RNA viruses, those that infect a specific host usually fall into several discrete viral species; for example, human coronaviruses that infect human include four distinct species, namely OC43 (Vabret et al., 2003), 229E (Yeager et al., 1992), NL63 (Hofmann et al., 2005), and HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005). Viruses infecting a specific host do not form a \u201ccontinuous\u201d spectrum. However, when we tried to perform phylogenetic analysis on short fragments of PBVs amplified from human samples downloaded from the GenBank, it was noted that these human PBVs formed a spectrum covering the whole phylogenetic tree (data not shown). In the present study on PBVs of different animal hosts, a similar phenomenon was observed. PBVs from horses, pigs, and cattle were widely distributed in the whole phylogenetic tree, and PBVs from sea lions and monkeys also showed high diversity (Figure 1). In addition no two PBVs were detected to be the same among the 52 positive samples, except for that found in two pairs of sea lions, which possessed identical sequences even in the short fragment of 205 bases used for screening. The reason for this phenomenon remains unclear, although it may be partly due to the high mutation rate of PBVs, as quasispecies are frequently found in PBV sequences. Unfortunately, no PBV has been isolated in all studies so far. Therefore, further confirmation by repeated passage of a PBV strain and sequencing, which will determine its mutation rate more accurately, is not possible.",

In this study, multiple strains of PBV were observed in the same fecal samples of cattle, monkeys, horses, pigs, and sea lions. This phenomenon was also confirmed by sequencing the complete segments 1 and 2 of otarine PBVs directly from the fecal samples of sea lions (Figure 2; Table 4). Among the 12 samples that showed positive results, more than one clade of segment 2 were present in three of the 12 samples and more than one clade of segment 1 were present in two of the seven segment 1 positive samples (Table 4). It is of note that due to the low number of complete segments 1 and 2 sequences of PBV in GenBank, some of the segments in the fecal samples of the sea lions in the present study could not be amplified and sequenced. In fact, only nine complete/near-complete PBV segment 1 sequences are available in GenBank, making sequencing of segment 1 particularly difficult using the genome walking approach. Despite these technical difficulties, more than one segment 1 and/or more than one segment 2 were observed in at least five fecal samples of the sea lions in this study. The presence of more than one segment 1 and more than one segment 2 in the same sample is rare in other segmented RNA viruses. This phenomenon makes it difficult to ascertain which segment 1 corresponds to which segment 2 in individual PBV genomes from a specific fecal sample.",

Bioinformatics analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of ORF1 and ORF2 possess no significant homology with any known protein and no putative transmembrane domain was found. Interestingly, three different kinds of previously undescribed ORFs not homologous to each other were also found upstream to the ORF encoding RdRp in the segment 2 sequences of six otarine PBVs in this study (Figure 2). Similar to ORF1 and ORF2, these three ORFs were predicted by the gene prediction program FGENESV, instead of only the ORF Finder. These three kinds of ORFs showed no homology to any known proteins and did not possess any known protein domains, families or functional sites.

The most thoroughly studied segmented RNA viruses are the influenza viruses (negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus) and rotaviruses (double-stranded RNA virus). Influenza viruses evolve through reassortment of RNA segments resulting in antigenic shifts and RNA mutations leading to antigenic drifts and causing major pandemics, lots of mortalities and morbidities, and economic lost (Smith et al., 2009). As for rotaviruses, virus strains belonging to the same group can also reassort their genomes resulting in enormous diversity (Kirkwood, 2010). This provides one of the mechanisms for the emergence of new rotavirus strains leading to disease outbreaks and loss of vaccine efficacy (Kirkwood, 2010). The presence of multiple segment 1 and segment 2 in the same animal observed in this study provides the PBV genome a good opportunity for reassortment (Figure 4). In addition, in the serially collected fecal samples from sea lions, it was also observed that two segment 1 sequences that belonged to the same clade (C3) can be present in the same animal (GiGi) from two consecutive years (Table 4). There were 18 nucleotide changes in these two segment 1 sequences, leading to 11 amino acid changes. This could be due to persistence of the same PBV with mutational changes over 2 years or re-infection by another otarine PBV with segment 1 of the same clade but of a different sequence type.",
