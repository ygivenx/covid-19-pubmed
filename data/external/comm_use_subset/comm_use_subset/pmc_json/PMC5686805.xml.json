Viruses first target airway epithelial cells (AEC) and then antigen-presenting cells (APC), including conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (cDC and pDC, respectively), via the mobilization of pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as toll-like receptors (TLR) and RNA helicases (RIG-I, MDA5) [3, 4]. hRV induce innate interferon (IFN) production in AEC via RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 [5, 6] whereas influenza virus requires TLR7 [7]. Impairment in anti-viral response has been reported in asthmatic patients infected with hRV, as shown by altered production of type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and/or type III IFNs [interleukin (IL)-28 and IL-29] [8\u201311]. However, if the deficient IFNs response has been reported in severe asthma, associated with a defect in TLR activation, it was not observed in well controlled asthma [12\u201314].",

We hypothesized that alteration of the expression and/or function of virus sensors is associated with impaired innate immune response during virus-induced asthma exacerbation. Moreover, these alterations might impact on clinical and inflammatory profiles. To test this hypothesis, the anti-viral response and the expression and function of the virus sensors in blood mononuclear cells were explored in a cohort of allergic asthmatic children admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe exacerbation. Evaluation also included clinical features and airway and blood inflammation and was done at exacerbation and repeated at steady state, 8 weeks later. First, we compared virus infected to not-infected patients at exacerbation. Secondly, as our results showed that an infection with a different virus is frequently detected in asthmatic patients at steady state [15, 16], we focused on the virus-infected patients at exacerbation in order to compare patients infected at both times to those only infected at the exacerbation.",

Low production of type I and III interferons by AEC and alveolar macrophages experimentally infected by hRV has been reported in asthmatic children and adults [8\u201310, 14], more profound in severe atopic asthma [12]. In the present study, patients infected with hRV appeared to display the same impairment (data not shown). In contrast, Bergauer et al. recently reported that IFN-\u03b1 levels were markedly increased in a small cohort of hRV-infected symptomatic asthmatic children (4.8 \u00b1 0.64 years) as compared with infected but asymptomatic patients whereas IL-29 synthesis remains unchanged [11]. Our results suggest that IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb production is altered during virus-induced exacerbations in asthmatic children. Compared to our study, the population differs from that of Bergauer et al. by the age and also the severity of the exacerbation [11]. Furthermore, their results seems to be inconsistent on a larger cohort. At last in our V+ patients, the alteration of the anti-viral response was not linked to a modification of the expression of PRR of blood DC and monocytes nor with a blockade of their function. These results might also suggest that the alteration of the anti-viral response might preferentially be observed in the airways compared with blood cells.",

IL-29 and IFN-\u03b3 production were also lower at steady state, despite the presence of a new virus. As compared with V + V-, TLR3 and RNA-helicases were overexpressed on circulating APCs in V + V+ patients. During exacerbation, their PBMC showed an altered IFN-\u03b3 and IL-29 production after TLR3 and RIGI activation, that might facilitate the viral re-infection according to the IL-29 function [30]. The IL-29 production in response to TLR7-8 ligand was also impaired, suggesting a defective function of these receptors in PBMC from V + V+ patients, as recently reported in alveolar macrophages [14]. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-29 production impairment may be due to an altered signaling. Different mechanisms might be responsible for this defective production. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 inhibits IFN production in response to hRV [31]. The implication of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 overexpression in airway epithelium of severe asthmatic children have been suggested [32] although this is controversial [33]. Our data suggest that a specific alteration of the anti-viral response related to a dysfunction of virus sensors characterize these re-infected patients.",

In V + V+, the lack of increase in IL-5 levels suggests that virus-infections don\u2019t directly influence IL-5 in this subgroup. Nevertheless, it has been reported that viral infection in an allergic environment can induce IL-5 synthesis by CD8+ T cells, probably due to PRR activation in DC [35]. Interestingly, the production of IL-5 after TLR7-8 stimulation was primed in PBMC from V+ patients, a result probably due to the V + V- subgroup. Concomitantly, DC activation during exacerbation was demonstrated by the over-expression of CD86 and contributes to the APC propensity to induce IL-5 secretion by T lymphocytes in infected patients. The link between Th2 inflammation and antiviral response is also illustrated by the restoration of IFN-\u03b1 production by plasmacytoid DC in allergic asthmatic children treated with omalizumab [36].",

This defect is associated with an overexpression of virus sensors, a defective response to the corresponding ligands and with a specific airway inflammation. The benefit of strategies integrating an antiviral approach in this subgroup of patients should be further explored.",
