            "text": "Canine distemper, caused by canine distemper virus (CDV), is a highly contagious and fatal systemic disease found worldwide not only in dogs and many other carnivores but also in some non-carnivores [1]. CDV is a non-segmented, negative-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and the genus Morbillivirus, and is one of the most lethal infectious agents in both susceptible free-living and captive carnivores [2]. CDV-infected dogs may develop respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, ophthalmic or neurological disorders, that appear simultaneously or sequentially [3, 4]. The broad spectrum of clinical signs, not dissimilar from the signs observed in other respiratory and enteric diseases of dogs, hampers accurate and early clinical diagnosis of canine distemper [5]. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis of CDV infection would enable veterinarians to implement appropriate strategies in time to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks, particularly within a shelter environment.",

The RT-PCR assays however, are cold chain dependent and require relatively expensive equipment with experienced technicians, making these assays difficult to implement in the field and at the point-of-care. Recently, an iiPCR method was reported for rapid and sensitive detection of CDV [1], but the reaction time was about 1 h. A simple, rapid, accurate and user-friendly platform is still needed for early point-of-care (POC) detection of CDV infection.",

            "text": "Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal gene amplification technique that has been demonstrated to be a rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective molecular method to identify pathogens [10, 11]. As with PCR, the use of two opposing primers allows exponential amplification of the target sequence in RPA, but the latter is tolerant to 5\u20139 mismatches in primer and probe showing no influence on the performance of the assay [12\u201314]. It is thought that RPA possesses superiority in speed, portability and accessibility over PCR [15]. Indeed, RPA has recently been explored to replace PCR for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens with different detection strategies, e.g., bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses [13, 15\u201321]. In this study, the development of a real-time RT-RPA assay for simple, rapid, portable and POC detection of CDV was described. The fluorescence in the assay is produced by an exo probe which is detected with a portable, user-friendly tube scanner (Genie III, OptiGene Limited, West Sussex, United Kingdom). The Genie III used in the study weighs only 1.75 kg, measuring 25 cm \u00d7 16.5 cm \u00d7 8.5 cm, and incorporates a rechargeable battery that can support operation for a whole day, making it suitable for point-of-care testing.",

Specificity analysis revealed that the RT-RPA assay could only detect the CDV, but not other viruses (Fig. 1). Other CDV genotypes were not included in the assay except for the genotype America-2, which is deficiency of the study. The RPA is tolerant to 5\u20139 mismatches in primer and probe showing no influence on the performance of the assay [12\u201314], and there were only 2\u20134 mismatches in the primers and probe in this study with other CDV genotypes. It is assumed the assay would detect all genotypes of CDV, based on targeting a conserved region, but this was not confirmed by testing validated genotypes. The detection limit of the RT-RPA was 9.4 copies, which was 10 times lower than the real-time RT-PCR described previously [8]. We further evaluated this method using clinical samples, and the diagnosis agreement of the RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR was 100%. Interpretations were limited by the small sample-size, but the results suggested that the developed RT-RPA performed well in CDV detection. RT-RPA assay should be further tested to more CDV strain RNA extracts or clinical samples from various regions worldwide to evaluate sensitivity of the assay for detecting various strains of the virus circulating.",

In the RT-LAMP assay for CDV, four primers were needed and the optimal reaction condition was 60 min at 65 \u00b0C [9]. The developed iiPCR could detect as low as 7.6 copies of CDV RNA in approximately 1 h [1]. For the RT-RPA assay developed in this paper, it could detect 9.4 copies of CDV RNA in 12 min, which was more rapid than the above assays. Compared to other isothermal amplification techniques, RPA requires no initial heating for DNA denaturation, and the results could be obtained in less than 20 min; RPA demonstrates a certain tolerance to common PCR inhibitors, and could tolerate a wide range of biological samples [11]; RPA reagents in the lyophilized pellet form could be delivered and stored without cold chain, which could perform satisfactory at 25 \u00b0C for up to 12 weeks and at 45 \u00b0C for up to 3 weeks [24]. Thus, RPA may be the most applicable approach for the field and point-of-care diagnosis of infectious diseases [11]. A noteworthy feature of the developed RT-RPA assay, i.e., the use of the tube scanner Genie III makes on-site CDV detection feasible, which is especially important for CDV detection and epidemiological surveillance in the field.",
