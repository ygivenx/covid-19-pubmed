            "text": "The thiopyranothiazole scaffold is characterized by \u201cfixed\u201d 4-thiazolidinone biophor in a \u201crigid\u201d condensed system that allows to save the biological activity of their synthetic precursors 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones. 4-Thiazolidinones and related heterocycles comprise a sufficiently studied class of compounds that reveal a wide spectrum of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, anticonvulsant, antituberculous [1,2,3,4], etc. Among thiazolidinone derivatives, there are a number of drug candidates as well as approved drugs, for example, anti-hyperglycemic glitazones (PPAR\u03b3 agonists)\u2014Roziglitazone, Pioglitazone (2,4-thiazolidinedione derivatives) [5]; aldose reductase inhibitor\u2014Epalrestat (rhodanine derivative) [6]; anti-inflammatory drug\u2014double cyclooxygenase-2/5-lipooxygenase inhibitor\u2014Darbufelon (2-amino-4-thiazolidone derivative) [7]; diuretic Ethozoline (2-ene-4-thiazolidinone derivative) [8]; anticonvulsant Ralitolin [9]. However, recently, such a rich pharmacological profile of thiazolidinones is considered by some medicinal chemists not as an advantage, but as a drawback. For example, 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones, being the most active subgroup, is classified as PAINS (pan assay interference compounds) that are defined by their ability to show activity across a range of assays and towards a range of proteins [10,11]. This is argued by a variety of inherent biological activity, low selectivity and the ability of 5-ylidene-4-thiazolidinones to be Michael acceptors. Despite this, rigorous selection based on SAR analysis and proved selectivity leave such compounds a \u00abright to life\u00bb in medicinal chemistry [12,13,14]. Moreover, the objects of our review (thiopyranothiazoles) can be considered as bio-mimetics of pharmacologically active 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones without the mentioned Michael acceptors properties (Figure 1) [15,16,17]. The combination of thiazole and thiopyran cycles in condensed heterosystem is a precondition for the creation of \u201ccenters conservative\u201d of the ligand-target binding complex and promotes potential selectivity to biotargets. Considering the mentioned arguments, the directed search for new chemotherapeutic agents among thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives is a justified and promising direction in modern medicinal chemistry. In this review, we tried to systematize the data on chemistry and pharmacology of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles from the perspective of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry.",

For example, in the reaction of crotonic acid, its amides or anhydride a mixture of rel-5R,5aR,11bS and rel-5S,5aR,11bS diastereomers (65) were formed; the isomers\u2019 ratio depends on the nature of dienophile and the reaction temperature [26]. The reaction of heterodiene 64 with maleic and fumaric acids and their derivatives (maleic anhydride, esters) passed diastereoselectively [46,47]. Moreover, independently of the stereoisomerism of the dienophile a racemic mixture of rel-(5R,5aR,11bS)-2,6-dioxo-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5] thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-5-carboxylic acids derivatives 66 with a cis-Hydrogen in positions 5, 5\u03b1, and 11\u03b2 of heterocyclic systems was formed. Itaconic acid and its anhydride [48,49] as well as trans-aconitic acid [33] reacted in a similar manner forming derivative 67. In the case of trans-aconitic acid the reaction proceeded with spontaneous decarboxylation at position 5 of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole core [33]. rel-(5S,5aR,11bS)-5-Aryl-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno [4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-2,6-diones 68 were the products of tandem hetero-Diels\u2013Alder-acylation reaction of 5-(2-hydroxyphenylmethylidene)isorhodanines and cynnamic acids [26]. Compound 67 proved to be effective reagent for the next chemical transformations. The reaction of 67 with primary amines in acetic acid passed through the amidation stage, followed by spontaneous recycling in spiroimides 68. The thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 68 were also obtained by the alternative method from itaconic acid imides [48].",

However, unlike monocyclic 4-thiazolidinones, the mechanism of their antitumor activity is not well understood yet. Moreover, quite often, biophore fragments of the active 4-thiazolidinone derivatives save their pharmacological effect in the new polycyclic scaffold. The latter may be considered as an argument in favour of the given class of compounds as a source of \u00absmall drug-like molecules\u00bb, in particular anticancer agents. Thus, among fused polycyclic thiazolothiopyranes a large number of compounds characterized by the high inhibition rates and/or cytostatic activity towards cell lines of leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, prostate and CNS cancer were identified. A series of N-substituted chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles revealed sufficiently high level of growth inhibition of different cancer cells with the avarage logGI50 values from \u22124.49 to \u22126.22 in the in vitro studies (Figure 6). The most active were compounds with the ester-106, N-trifluoromethylphenyl- and 3,4-dichlorophenyl-acetamide fragments (107,108) in the molecules that were characterized by the cytostatic effects against a panel of cancer cell lines. On the other hand, 4-methylphenylacetamide substituent in the N3 position of tetracycle increased its selective activity against leukemia cell lines, which was observed at submicromolar concentrations (logGI50 = \u22126.93 for CCRF-CEM and < \u22128.00 for HL-60(TB)), whilst its inhibition activity against other cancer cells turned out to be relatively low [55]. Interestingly that structurally related fused system of isothiochromeno[3,4-d]thiazole (Figure 6) with 3-trifluoromethylphenylacetamide 109 and 3-methylphenylacetamide 110 substituents in the N3 position had also showed high antitumor effects along with low acute cytotoxicity levels [54,56].",

One of the most studied synthetic protocol for thiopyranothiazoles is the hetero-Diels\u2013Alder [4+2]-cycloaddition being rather fast and efficient method that yields good outcomes and stereoselectivity of the products. The tandem processes based on hetero-Diels\u2013Alder and Michael reactions used for the thiopirano[2,3-d]thiazoles synthesis have also been discussed. In contrast to the well discribed various synthetic routes of thiopyranothiazoles synthesis, biological activity of these derivatives have not been studied that much. Nevertheless, they are considered as 5-ene-4-thiazolidinone synthetic biomimetics that save pharmacological profile without revealing Michael acceptors properties. Among established biological activities of the thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives, the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer as well as aniparasitic activities are the most prominent and need further in-depth studies. Considering all the above, the directed search for new drug-like molecules and possible chemotherapeutic agents among thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives is justified and promising direction in the medicinal chemistry. Moreover, the way of annealing of thiazolidine core into thiopyranothiazole analogs is used as one of the molecular optimization directions to decrease the toxicity and/or avoid the Michael acceptor properties as well.",
