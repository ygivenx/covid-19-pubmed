            "text": "The clinical importance and efficacy of facemask infection prevention are documented in the international literature [2, 3]. Past studies have shown that the perceived susceptibility, the perceived severity of being afflicted with life-threatening diseases, and the perceived benefits of using a facemask are predictors of people\u2019s facemask use [2]. However, I argue that people use a facemask not only for infection prevention. Various sociocultural reasons motivate people to use (and not use) a facemask, which has sociocultural implications for people. However, research on the sociocultural meanings of facemasks is scant, and even less is known on how the shifting sociocultural meanings of facemasks are related to the changing social environment, which, I argue, serve as critical underlying factors for people\u2019s use (and the absence of use) of a facemask. Because of the effects of globalization and well-developed international transportation, epidemic outbreaks are no longer confined to a single country. As new infectious diseases such as avian influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have continued emerging, threatening people\u2019s health worldwide, and because facemasks have been documented to have significant efficacy in the prevention of infection transmission, therefore, understanding the sociocultural meanings of the facemask has critical implications for public health policymakers and health care providers in designing a socially and culturally responsive public health and infection control policy for the community.",

            "text": "Symbolic representation, or symbolism, is a popular area of study in the humanities. Medical instruments such as a stethoscope and white coat often convey symbolic implications [4, 5], affecting people\u2019s identity, emotions, and behavior [5, 6]. These symbolic implications influence how people perceive others who are associated with these objects, which influences how they react to the objects. In a similar manner, the facemask also has symbolic implications for people. These implications influence how people perceive facemasks, how people perceive those who use them, and how people respond to facemask use. These factors in turn affect people\u2019s adoption of preventive health behavior regarding facemask use. Moreover, these symbolic implications undergo constant change because of the different and changing sociocultural environment. Facemasks carry different symbolic implications for people in different societies, and hence, different perceptions and interpretations exist regarding facemask use, resulting in different health behaviors among communities. For example, concerning the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, the difference in attitude between South Koreans and the Hong Kong population toward facemask use not only generated cultural clashes between the two populations [7\u201310], but could also lead to different outcomes in epidemic control. However, literature on the symbolic implications of facemasks for people is scant; how the mechanism of such changes in symbolic meaning is triggered remains unknown. Because of this research gap, this study investigated the sociocultural meanings of facemasks in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak and in the post-SARS era, showing how the changes in the symbolic implications of the facemask have occurred. This study also examined how these changing symbolic implications can influence people\u2019s adoption (and repudiation) of facemasks when used as a preventive health measure.",

In the beginning of the SARS outbreak, most people in Hong Kong, myself included, were unaware of the importance of using a facemask. Facemask use was extremely rare for people in Hong Kong and could be perceived as a display of strange behavior, and the person using it could be viewed as a highly infectious patient warranting social seclusion. Although a few people had been observed using a facemask in public spaces at the beginning of the outbreak, they were often secluded. In one case, I encountered a woman who was using a facemask, and my immediate response was to walk away from her.",

All of the professors at the Faculty of Medicine in The Chinese University of Hong Kong used facemasks at the press conference, which visually reinforced the severity of SARS. Alarmed by the severity of the outbreak, my family began to scramble for facemasks, as did the rest of Hong Kong. According to the official recommendations of medical professionals, my family aimed to obtain three-layered surgical facemasks because N95 respirators had been depleted during the outbreak.",

Moreover, at the community level, different social institutions also exerted a strong mode of control over my facemask use during those months. All students were required to use a facemask in schools and in universities during the outbreak. Failure in using a facemask in the university that I was studying would mean that these noncomplying students were to be prohibited from attending lectures. Using a facemask during the SARS outbreak was widely perceived as an infection-preventive measure; furthermore, using a facemask in public areas was perceived as a new social norm, and a person would be subject to discrimination if he or she failed to comply. In one case, I encountered a neighbor in the lift who just used tissue to cover up her nose and mouth, and I immediately walked out from the lift and stared at her at the same time. My values and beliefs toward facemasks have changed since the SARS outbreak. Before the outbreak, I did not have any knowledge of using facemasks. My impression of those who used a facemask was negative before the outbreak, and I perceived that these people were either strange or mentally ill. The SARS outbreak, however, has changed my perceptions of facemask use and instilled in me more positive perceptions of this behavior.",

I have been perceiving facemask use as a civic responsibility when one falls ill. However, as an anthropologist, I am also aware that the perceptions of facemask use are never static for one community, but rather, these meanings undergo constant change over time. Because of different life encounters and experiences, people would have varying perceptions of facemasks, and these perceptions can influence whether they use a facemask, akin to what I have been experiencing in my life also influencing my perception of facemasks, and in turn influencing my facemask use behavior. Instead of representing sick people without a facemask as not exercising their civic responsibilities, this study examined the shifting cultural meanings of facemask use in Hong Kong from the SARS outbreak in 2003 to the influenza A (H3N2) outbreak in January 2015 and how these shifting cultural meanings could have implications for infection control in the future.",

Other pandemics such as avian influenza and MERS have also been threatening the public health of Hong Kong. However, the importance of the preventive health behavior adoption of facemask using has been diminishing. The shifting sociocultural meanings of facemask in Hong Kong since the SARS outbreak, as demonstrated by the participants, can explain this preventive health behavioral change on the community level. The shifting sociocultural meanings of using facemask can demotivate people in adopting the facemask using behavior, making infection control as more difficult to achieve during epidemic outbreaks, conveying significant implications for the public health and infection control in the post-SARS era. Facemask using has been documented as having significant clinical importance in infection prevention [2, 3]; encouraging people using a facemask is thus one of the remarkable public health measures on epidemic containment. Therefore, one of the key directions of public health and infection prevention policy in future is suggested to adopt a culturally sensitive education approach, educating the general public about the positive aspects of facemask using behavior.",

Because of the negative stereotypes associated with the use of facemasks in post-SARS Hong Kong, the sociocultural meanings of facemasks have undergone continuous change, from positive to negative. Because of the changes in social needs, the meanings of facemasks that had developed during the SARS outbreak could not be sustained in the post-SARS era. During the SARS outbreak, the social functions of the facemask were significant not only in terms of providing a practical approach to infection prevention, but also in providing symbolic uses for obtaining a sense of control and security, fulfilling the new social norm, and displaying civic responsibility and support for health care providers. To fulfill these social needs, the sociocultural meanings of facemasks were thus constructed to be positive. However, such social needs were lacking in the post-SARS era, leading to changes in the social functions and sociocultural meanings of facemasks. The changes to the social and political environment generated a negative image of facemask usage, preventing the participants from pursuing this health behavior. The experiences of the participants thus enabled a holistic understanding regarding the perceptions of facemask use. The shifting sociocultural meanings of facemask use in Hong Kong, however, can impose a potential risk to the public health of Hong Kong citizens in case of a future epidemic outbreak. Witnessing younger participants tending to hold more negative perceptions of facemask usage in the post-SARS era was alarming. These findings have critical implications for health authorities in designing a culturally responsive infection prevention and facemask usage policy in the future.",
