In addition it has allowed a better understanding of the normal endogenous microbiota. The vaginal microbiota is complex, varying at different stages of reproductive life, as well as during the menstrual cycle. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition affecting the vaginal microbiota where in the childbearing age woman the natural microbiota (typically Lactobacillus spp.) is depleted, and replaced by an overgrowth of mixed, primarily anaerobic bacteria [2]. This condition has significant associations with miscarriage, premature birth and pelvic infections, and can increase a woman's risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and HIV [3]. No single aetiological agent has been identified yet for BV, and is now generally considered likely to be of polymicrobial aetiology.",

For bacteria, the predominant RNA classes are ribosomal (primarily 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA), which are able to be used as taxonomic identifiers. The metatranscriptomic screening of clinical samples has been described for gut and dental microbiomes [6], [7], with only one study to date applying this methodology to BV[8]. An important difficulty faced with the application of this technique to clinical samples is the low levels of RNA present in many samples and the overabundance of host RNA. This requires reduction of host RNA and subsequent linear amplification of RNA for transcriptomic analysis [9], [10].",

Each dataset was then screened for chimeric sequences using UCHIME [16], with the trimmed and filtered data submitted to the MG-RAST (http://metagenomics.anl.gov) bioinformatics pipeline for analysis (cDNA library MG-RAST ID = 4461586.3; DNA amplicon MG-RAST ID = 4461792.3) [17]. A 90% cut-off was used for database searches within MG-RAST as an arbitrary cut-off for genus identities using the RDP database, and a 98% cut-off was used for species level identification [18]. MG-RAST generates abundance counts based on the number of unique hits a particular sequence has against a particular database. It is therefore highly likely that a single read may have multiple abundance counts assigned to it if there is an equal relatedness. The identities for each read were sorted using Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA) to eliminate multiple identical hits for individual reads, with manual analysis being carried out using the BLAST algorithm for discrepant samples. Graphical representation of bacterial abundances was achieved using Krona charts [19]. Functional genes from the cDNA library were characterised by SEED analysis within MG-RAST.",

Overall, this library consisted of 72826 (93%) bacterial reads, 3865 (4.9%) human reads and 34 (0.04%) either plastid, fungal or viral reads (Table 1). Of the bacterial reads, 31857 (43.7%) were of the 16S rRNA gene and 4349 (6.0%) were non-ribosomal RNA (eg. mRNA) with the remaining matching other ribosomal regions such as the 23S rRNA gene and intergenic regions. Of the 16S rRNA gene reads, the most dominant genus identified was Prevotella (36% of the reads), followed by the genera Megasphaera (19%), Leptotrichia/Sneathia (8%), Fusobacterium (8%), and 9% of the reads matching uncultured members of the Fusobacteriales (Figure 2). Of the Prevotella reads, 78% formed contigs of \u22651000 bp in length that matched P. amnii. Analysis of assembly free reads of the Prevotella spp. reads at the species level (11725 reads with \u226598% match to the RDP database) showed similar results, however distinction between P. amnii and P. bivia was not possible for the majority of these sequences (data not shown). The major Fusobacterium was F. nucleatum, and the majority of Megasphaera reads were \u226598% similar to the currently uncharacterised Veillonellaceae bacterium S3PF24 (Genbank accession JX104009). The bioinformatics pipeline of MG-RAST was able to annotate 2053/4349 of the non-ribosomal RNA reads, which SEED analysis revealed to consist of genes involved primarily in protein metabolism (20.6%), carbohydrate/lipid utilisation (16.3%) and cluster based subsystems (13%). The most abundant functional gene read identities were primarily represented by genes expressed by the genus Prevotella (Table 2).",

Prevotella amnii was found to be the most active species present in this sample and was also detected at a high concentration by qPCR in 30.6% of BV cases in sexually active women. Although we identified P. amnii as the predominant Prevotella species in this sample (78% of Prevotella reads; 28.1% of total bacterial population), there may be a possible overestimation in the cDNA abundance given, as conserved regions shared by multiple Prevotella spp. may be involved through chimeric assembly. This must be kept in mind when comparing to qPCR data (33.1% of Prevotella reads; 15.8% of total bacterial population) that would otherwise suggest that this species is more active than others in this sample. This bacteria has only recently been associated with BV in the literature [27]. Its closest relative, P. bivia, is highly cited as being associated with this condition, and in vitro studies have shown this bacterium to form a symbiotic relationship with G. vaginalis [28]. These two Prevotella spp. share many phenotypic traits and it has been noted that culture-based methodologies may not differentiate between these two species, with full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing recommended for species differentiation [29].",

F. nucleatum has been described in cases of BV previously [30]. Interestingly it has been implicated in amniotic infection and pre-term birth in cases where the bacterium was also detected in the patients' oral cavity [31], [32]. F. nucleatum, as well as both Prevotella and Megasphaera spp. are regularly associated with periodontal disease [33], [34], [35], and it is of interest to note that the single Nugent score 10 participant analysed in this study had a history of recent female-female oral sex. These three bacteria were more abundant than the usual predominant G. vaginalis and A. vaginae in the cDNA library, which collectively only comprised 10% [2].

This may suggest that there was a significant difference between what is present and what is transcriptionally active, although these findings are limited by the fact that this is a single sampling point. The broad range amplification of bacterial DNA using the 16S rRNA gene may have potential bias in the community structure, as has been found in numerous studies [38], [39], [40], [41]. Our data suggests that G. vaginalis was underrepresented in the DNA amplicon library when compared to the qPCR data from the same DNA sample. Despite being one of the most utilized primers for microbiome analysis, there has been suggestion in the literature that the forward PCR primer 27F may not reliably amplify this species [42], and our analysis has demonstrated this similarly through qPCR for G. vaginalis. Also, given that L. iners was found to be underrepresented in the cDNA library when compared to the DNA amplicon library, we applied a genus-specific Lactobacillus qPCR assay to the DNA sample, as well as one that targeted the genus Prevotella that was present at a much higher abundance in the cDNA library. We found that there was no statistical difference in the abundances given between qPCR and the cDNA library for these genera. Based on this limited data, we can suggest misrepresentation of several taxa in the DNA amplicon library occurred, and that in this case, the vast majority of the bacteria physically present in this sample were also transcriptionally active. This further highlights the advantage of transcriptomics for such analysis as our data suggest that this analysis gives better representation of bacterial levels across the board.",

We have demonstrated that this kind of metatranscriptomic approach can be used to identify targets for screening in larger studies. As this study focussed on a single individual, generalisations based on the data are not possible and transcriptomic analyses on a large cohort is warranted. This being said, our limited findings reinforce that P. amnii may be an important BV-associated bacterium, and should be included in future studies investigating the pathogenesis of BV. Its previously known association with periodontal disease, and the association with oral sex in this study, make it interesting to speculate about transmission of pathogenic bacteria between the oral and vaginal cavities, and their role in the development of BV.",
