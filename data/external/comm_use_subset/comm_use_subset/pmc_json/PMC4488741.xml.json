            "text": "Chronic paralysis is an infectious and contagious disease of adult honeybees (Apis mellifera L.). It is known to induce a cluster of clinical signs, such as trembling and flightless bees crawling at the hive entrance [1]. The viral agent that causes this disease is the chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV). CBPV shows neurotropism in concomitance with observed clinical signs [2]. The viral particle is anisometric and non-enveloped, its size being about 30\u201360 nm in length and 20 nm in width [3]. CBPV is a positive single-stranded fragmented RNA virus; its genome is composed of two major RNA fragments that have been completely sequenced, RNA 1 (3674 nt) and RNA 2 (2305 nt) [4]. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA sequences has shown that there are seven putative overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), three on RNA 1 and four on RNA 2 [4] (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Comparing amino acid sequences deduced from each ORF with protein sequence databases, only ORF 3 on RNA 1 shares significant similarities with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of positive single-stranded RNA viruses. Indeed, this putative RdRp of CBPV possesses the eight conserved domains (I\u2013VIII), and the specific catalytic subunit containing the GDD motif. Based on the eight conserved domains of RdRp, a phylogenetic study shows that CBPV seems to occupy an intermediate position between families Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae [4]. CBPV shares some features with these virus families [5], suggesting that the ORFs on RNA 1 encode non-structural proteins and ORFs on RNA 2 encode structural proteins. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of ORF 2 and 3 on RNA 2 yield two proteins with predicted molecular masses of about 65.5 kDa and 19.7 kDa, respectively. These molecular masses may correspond to previously immunodetected proteins, estimated at 75 and 20 kDa [5]. The molecular mass of the 20 kDa protein is similar to the single capsid protein of about 23.5 kDa proposed by Bailey [6]. Therefore, ORF 3 on RNA 2 may encode a capsid protein, called predicted structural protein (pSP) [7]. Despite the current knowledge on CBPV, this virus cannot yet be assigned to any viral family. However, genomic sequences of two novel honeybee viruses have been identified, Lake Sinai virus 1 and 2 (LSV 1 and LSV 2). These genomes have similarities with CBPV RNA 1 and the ORFs encoding RdRp show 25% amino acid identity with CBPV. Amino acid phylogeny of RdRp of families Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae places LSV 1 and 2 on the same branch as CBPV [8]. A unique nodavirus, called Mosinovirus, was recently placed between the monopartite LSV and bipartite CBPV by phylogenetic analysis [9]. In a recent study Kuchibatla et al. [10] made some predictions about CBPV structure and composition: (I) ORF1 of RNA1 contains a Methyltransferase-Guanylyltransferase; (II) pSP could be membrane-associated protein with 3 or 4 transmembrane segments, and potential N-glycosylation sites, which is conserved in a wide range of insect and plant viruses; and (III) hSP could be a virion glycoprotein with two transmembrane segments. These predictions were made using powerful sequence similarity search methods, but at present experimental evidence are lacking to confirm these hypotheses.",

Since mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged, a combination of techniques has been developed, thereby providing new tools for structural investigations on viruses. One-dimensional (1D) electrophoresis and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis has proved to be useful for the exploration of virus proteomes such as the murine cytomegalovirus [11], Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus [12] or Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus [13]. Contrary to proteomic research on DNA viruses, proteomic studies have been performed on a limited spectrum of RNA viruses probably because the number of proteins in RNA viruses is smaller and proteomic approaches are generally not necessary. However, two RNA viruses have been intensively analyzed: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [14] and Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) [15]. Using SDS-Page followed by Electrospray ionization (ESI) MS/MS, structural proteins of SARS-CoV have been identified as components of the nucleocapsid and envelope. The LC coupled to MS/MS analysis of HIV-1 even identified cellular proteins associated with viral proteins, providing other ways to study HIV-1 assembly, infection and pathogenesis.",

We examined a CBPV preparation from honeybee heads that was purified on a sucrose gradient, followed by SDS-Page separation and nano-HPLC coupled to a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer. Our analysis revealed two CBPV proteins that are likely to be structural proteins.

CBPV particles were purified from heads of experimentally infected bees as previously described [4]. Briefly, 400 heads were manually crushed and the homogenate underwent successive centrifugations. Then, concentrated CBPV was separated on a 10% to 40% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 4.5 h at 15 \u00b0C (SW41 rotor). Viral fractions were collected, centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (PB).

Moreover, the micrograph confirmed that the virions were morphologically intact (data not shown). The purified CBPV particles were used for western blotting with various antisera (Figure 2). Although anti-RdRp antibodies recognize the recombinant protein corresponding to the fragment of RdRp used for rabbit immunization, RdRp was not detected in the purified CBPV sample (Figure 2A). By using anti-CBPV antibodies raised against purified viral particles, four polypeptides with molecular masses of approximately 60, 43, 29 and 18 kDa were detected (Figure 2B). Surprisingly, a similar pattern was observed when using anti-pSP antibodies. Although the predicted molecular weight of pSP is 19.7 kDa, four bands were observed (63, 44, 28 and 18 kDa) (Figure 2C). We thus hypothesize that the 18 kDa polypeptide corresponds to pSP, whereas other bands could correspond to different oligomerization states of pSP (see discussion). To check whether pSP is bound by disulfide bonds and forms multimers, SDS-Page and western blotting were performed with or without \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. No significant differences were observed, suggesting that disulfides bonds are not involved in the oligomerization of pSP (not shown).",

Post-translational modifications of viral capsid proteins, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, have been reported for other non-enveloped viruses [32,33,34], which may explained this discrepancy. Two other proteins were revealed at 44 and 63 kDa, suggesting that pSP may be a dimer and a trimer, or a dimer of post translationally modified protein as described earlier, e.g., for the P12 domain of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus Gag protein able to form di, tri and tetramers resistant to SDS Page [35].

            "text": "Another hypothesis would involve a combination of ORF 3 and ORF 2, yielding one fusion capsid protein (p65). This protein of about 65 kDa would be composed of 580 amino acids containing the whole sequence of pSP and mid-C-terminal region of hSP (Figure 5A). Protein p65 would result from the initiation of the translation at the first ATG codon of ORF 3, combined with a mechanism bypassing the ORF 3 stop codon and leading to the recovery of ORF 2 frame. Although the ATG of ORF 2 was found in a Kozak context [4], it is noteworthy that ORF 3 (pSP) is overlapping the 5\u2032 end of ORF 2 (N-terminal region of hSP). A novel analysis of translation initiation sites showed that ATG of ORF 2 is in a suboptimal Kozak context contrary to the ATG of ORF 3. Indeed, intitiation codons have a strong preference for the pattern A/GxxATGG, especially the G at +4 and the G at \u22123 [39]. The ATG of ORF 3 is in this situation (GxxATGG), contrary to the ATG of ORF 2 (TxxATGT). Thus, even if the ATG of ORF 2 is in front of the ATG of ORF 3, it is most likely that the ribosomes would rather initiate translation at the ORF 3 ATG almost all the time. Altogether, this could explain the lack of identification of peptides from the N-terminal region of hSP, and the presence of peptides from the mid to C-terminal region of hSP. Although no pseudoknot was detected in this region, the production of p65 associated to cleavages could also explain why no peptides were identified in N-terminal region of hSP and the unexpected apparent molecular mass of pSP and hSP. Indeed, the repartition of identified peptides from pSP and hSP could correspond to the location of these peptides on the sequence of p65 at about 65 kDa (Figure 5A). Moreover, the synthesized peptides used for the production of anti-pSP antibodies were located in the N-terminal region of pSP thus corresponding to the N-terminal region of p65 (Figure 5A). If we postulate that p65 possesses two cleavage sites (Figure 5A, arrowheads), the proteins having a molecular mass lower than 65 kDa on immunoblots would be cleavage products. If this is true, the 44 kDa band (Figure 2C) could result from the detection of two cleaved proteins: pSP until middle of p65 and mid-C-terminal region of p65 (Figure 5B). In this model the 29 kDa protein would be the post-translationally modified pSP (Figure 5C). For 18 kDa, the proteins would correspond to pSP and cleaved products of the two proteins at about 44 kDa (Figure 5D). Although this scheme is speculative, it could explain the pattern of the detected peptides.",

Nevertheless, an occurrence of a potential downstream secondary structure at positions 13\u201317 of ATG can enhanced the translation efficiency of some viral RNA [39,40] with this suboptimal context. Using the software, AUG_hairpin [29], the ATG codons at positions 869 and 920 possess a putative downstream hairpin, located at the distance of 15 nucleotides for 869 and 18 nucleotides for 920. Furthermore, no peptide of ORF 2 protein was identified in the part between the nucleotides 869 and 920 of RNA 2. These ATG codons could be candidate for the translation of a short ORF 2 (about 44 kDa) (Figure 5B).",

            "text": "According to the composition of pSP, the N-terminal region (residues 4 to 17) contains a high number of arginine residues and the peptide has a predicted \u03b1-helical secondary structure. Short regions containing basic amino acids (approximately 8\u201320 residues) are commonly used to bind RNA and can even recognise a specific RNA structure [41]. Arginine- and lysine-rich motifs (ARM and LRM) have been found in capsid proteins of several insect viruses, such as members of the genus Alphanodavirus, but also in plant viruses, such as members of the genera Bromovirus, Dianthovirus and Tombusvirus. For these genera of viruses, ARM deletions experiments [42,43] and substitutions of arginine or lysine residues [44,45] have demonstrated that this N-terminal region has a multifunctional nature. Indeed, ARM and LRM play a crucial role for RNA packaging and subsequent stable virion formation. In addition, this motif in Bromovirus and Dianthovirus is involved in infection and the cell-to-cell movement. Together with the proteomic results, the presence of positively charged sequences at the N-terminus of pSP reinforces the hypothesis that pSP is a structural protein of CBPV. In a recent study Kuchibhatla et al. [41] found some homologies between the RNA 2 ORF 3 encoded protein and membrane proteins from insect viruses, but they did not detect any homologs using HHpred. In the present study, HHpred analysis of pSP amino acids sequence revealed sequence similarity to the N-terminus part of the capsid protein alpha (39.6%) of Nodamura virus, a virus belonging to family Nodaviridae genus Alphanodavirus. However, due to low sequence complexity, this result does not imply that the proteins are homologous. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of capsid protein alpha of Nodamura virus contains ARM. Prior entry into cell, protein alpha undergoes cleavage yielding capsid proteins beta and gamma. In genus Alphanodavirus, capsid protein gamma is known to correspond to the hydrophobic C-terminal region of capsid protein alpha and is essential for breaching the host membrane, enabling capsid entry, as shown in some non-enveloped viruses [46]. Thus, when the viral particle is in contact with the cell, the hydrophobic region is exposed for membrane breaching. The CBPV virion may share features of protein conformation with these viruses. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity plot of fusion capsid protein (p65) revealed one hydrophobic C-terminal region corresponding to the C-terminal region of hSP and one cleaved protein of about 18 kDa. Therefore, this fragment protein could have the same role than the capsid protein gamma of family Nodaviridae. For CBPV, the interaction of ARM with RNA could facilitate the initiation of p65 cleavages leading to mature capsid proteins. Further work is needed to confirm these hypotheses.",
