The viral genome contains a 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) which are essential for viral RNA replication. The genome is translated as a single large polyprotein that is composed of four capsid proteins, VP1 to VP4, and seven nonstructural proteins, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. VP1 to VP4 capsid proteins were encoded by P1 region. The P2 and P3 regions encode nonstructural proteins and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3D, is a major component of the viral replication complex [9].",

Further investigation using sequence determination and BLAST sequence analysis revealed that all of the sequences had high homology (95.1%) with HEV71 (strain E2004104-TW-CDC, accession number EF373576).

In addition, the identification of HEV71 infection was hampered by the sudden death of 22 children within 5 days of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, heart and lung failure. RT-PCR and sequencing were primarily performed to identify the virological etiology of the outbreak. Laboratory testing showed that 39% of the cases were confirmed as HEV71 infection.

The findings were consistent with studies of the 1997 outbreak in Malaysia and the 1998 outbreak in Taiwan, in which manifestations of HEV71 infections predominate with neurological complications in fatal or severe cases[2,3]. Analyses of the VP1 sequence showed high homology between severe or fatal cases and mild HFMD cases and no significant nucleotide differences were found. Other groups have also studied the complete genome of HEV71 isolated from fatal and non-fatal HFMD cases and found no genetic differences that could be correlated with the severity of clinical manifestation[12,13]. Studies on the pathogenic mechanism for HEV71 have pointed to altered innate immunity. An epidemiologic study during the same outbreak implicated treatment of initial fever of HEV71 infections with glucocorticoids, which block the innate immune response, as contributing to the high rate of severe disease[14]. Experimental animal and clinical studies also support this finding indicating that weakened innate immunity is associated with severe disease and death from HEV71 infection[15-17]. This in combination with introduction of the new recombinant virus may help to explain the increased severity of the Fuyang outbreak.",

Based on the phylogenetic analyses, Fuyang isolates belonged to C4a cluster of the subgenotype C4 and showed high homology with the isolates circulating in other provinces of the mainland of China between 2007 and 2008, including those from the HFMD outbreak in Linyi city in Shandong province in 2007[8]. The C4 subgenotype of HEV71 was initially identified in Guangdong province in 1998 and has been continuously circulating for at least 10 years[10], which may reflect the pattern of endemic circulation of subgenotype C4 viruses. Interestingly, C4b viruses were the predominant circulating strain in mainland of China prior to 2004. Since then, however, C4a viruses have become the predominant strains, which have been continuously circulating and causing epidemic in the mainland of China so far [8].",
