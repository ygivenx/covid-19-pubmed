Several animal models have been developed to be EV71 infectious model using the mouse-adapted strain of EV71 [5], innate immunodeficient mice [6], or monkey models [7]. The intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of clinical isolate of EV71 to adult mice caused no apparent clinical symptoms. Administration of mouse-adapted EV71 strain 4643 (Tainan/4643/98) to 1-d-old ICR mice caused hind limb paralysis (LP) and death within 2 wk of the challenge [8]. Challenge of 1-d-old BALB/C and ICR mice infected with EV71 YN3 strain was also lethal [5]. A deficiency in type I and type II IFN receptors of the AG129 mouse cause neurological manifestations after infection with the non-mouse adapted EV71 strain (5865/SIN/00009; [6]). The EV71 BrCr strain, an original prototype of the genotype A strain from California [9], was demonstrated to induce neurological manifestations of tremor, ataxia, and brain edema, but no pulmonary edema (PE) and cardiac failure in cynomolgus monkeys [7]. These models are not perfect for HFMD or for neuropathogenesis caused by EV71. Viral pathogenesis in mouse-adapted EV71-infected newborn suckling mice dose not mimic human infection and exhibit the restricted timeframe (up to one week old of mouse age) allowing for pathogenic challenge of EV71. In addition, innate immunity, particularly type I IFN, involved for the EV71-induced pathogenic phenotype was reported [10], [11].",

The HFMD-like skin rashes were observed in transgenic mice pre-infected with clinical isolates E59 (genotype B4 of EV71) and N2838 (B5); severe limb paralysis and death in transgenic mice pre-inoculated with clinical isolates 5746 (C2), N3340 (C4) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) [11]. EV71 viral loads in the tissues and CNS accompanied the upregulated pro-inflammatory mediators (CXCL10, CCL3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6), correlating to recruitment of the infiltrated T lymphocytes that resulted in severe diseases in transgenic mice [11]. It was also observed in EV71 patients with encephalitis associated with PE that have a higher mortality rate (64.3%) than patients with brainstem encephalitis (26.3%) [13], [14], PE might be caused by increased pulmonary vascular permeability resulting from brainstem lesions caused by the excessive release of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 [13], [15], [16]. In this study, we investigate whether the hSCARB2-transgenic mouse model could be suitable for evaluating the protective efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71-specific neutralizing antibody, N3 [17]. Administration of N3 to transgenic mice reduced the developed hair loss and scurfy skin as well as limb paralysis induced by E59 infection and protected from severe limb paralysis resulting in death by 5746 infection. This protection associates with the reduction of the viral load in the brain, spinal cords, and limb muscles. It also associated with the reduction of the secreted pro-inflammatory mediators in tissues. These results demonstrated N3 might have potential to serve as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of EV71-induced severely HFMD patients.",

An isotype antibody was given at the same concentration (200 \u00b5g) as control in this study (Fig. 4). It was found that the mice had a better survival rate correlating to a shorter time interval of N3 administration post EV71 infection; mice were fully protected when given one dose of N3 at 3 h post infection, compared to the mice receiving N3 at 48 h post infection in which more than half of the mice died by the eighth day. Even administration of two doses of N3 at a later time (48 h post infection) could only extend the survival time period up to the eighth day post infection. Both groups of mice receiving late (48 h) treatment of N3 were died on 9 d after infection. In condition, approximately 60% of the mice receiving N3 24 h post infection were survived, and early administration of low doses of N3 3 h post infection also provided 90% protection from infection. Because early administration of 200 \u00b5g N3 might provide 100% protection against 5746 infection, this dose was chosen for following pathological studies.",

The muscle fibers were damaged in the non-treated mice and mice received isotype antibody but were not observed in the tissues from the mice received N3, compared to the section of normal muscle tissue (MOCK) (Fig. 5B). Our previous study had showed that microvilli in the inner layer of the small intestine of transgenic mice would be completely destroyed after EV71 infection [11]. To investigate whether the EV71-induced pathogenesis in the intestine can be inhibited by N3 or not, histopathological stains of the intestine tissue on Day 8 post infection was performed.

This is also corresponds to the clinical findings where CXCL10 increased in patients with EV71 [19]. Higher expression of CCL3 observed in the CNS of transgenic mice infected with EV71 may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes (neutrophils) during inflammation in the brain. Cytokine storm is thus proposed to cause severe symptoms. Administration of Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases [13]\u2013[15], [20]. We measured the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in the tissues of 5746-infected mice while receiving N3. Quantitative RT-PCR to the specific cytokines showed that CXCL10 expression was significantly reduced in brainstem, spinal cord, and limb muscle after N3 treatment (Fig. 7A). CCL3 expression was reduced in the brain and limb muscle (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, elevated IL-6 was shown in the spinal cord but not brainstem or muscle of infected mice (untreated group vs. isotype-treated group). Treatment of N3 effectively reduced the elevated IL-6 expression in the spinal cord and even reduced the basal level of IL-6 in the muscle (Fig. 7C). These chemokines downregulated markedly in CNS and limb muscle indicated that treatment with N3 at an early stage of 5746 infection hindered viral-induced pathogenesis, and might affect the lymphocyte infiltration in the inflammatory tissues.",

One dose of early N3 administration after CVA16 infection significantly prolonged survival but did not rescue the mice from developing neurological syndromes which eventually led to death (Fig. S1). This result could be explained by the result of weaker cross-neutralization of N3 against CVA16 (Fig. S2). Indeed, N3 was able to recognize CVA16 virions that was evident by evaluating the binding of N3 with CVA16 using ELISA (for na\u00efve protein interaction; Fig. S3) and Western blot (for denatured protein interaction; Fig. S4). In contrast to highly binding to two EV71 strains, N3 showed lower affinity to na\u00efve CVA16 (Fig. S3). Oppositely, anti-CVA16 antisera, obtained from mice immunized twice with live CVA16, equally detected all EV71 virus and CVA16 particles as depicted in Fig. S4. N3 recognizes the VP1 proteins of both B4 and C2 EV71 at approximately 35 kDa [17], [21] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 50 kDa [22] that is different from anti-CVA16 antisera which detected similar capsid protein patterns among both EV71 and CVA16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa.",

The lack of a relevant animal model has hampered the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Previously, We had developed and demonstrated that challenge of newborn hSCARB2-transgenic mice with B genotypes of EV71 isolates, the early syndrome of HFMD, followed by progressively neurological LP were developed. In addition, hSCARB2-transgenic mice elicit more susceptibility than the reported newborn mouse models for C genotype of EV71 infection which resulted in lethal neurological diseases.

Therefore, we tested the protective efficacy of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 in a reliable model. Here we show that by using N3, hSCARB2-transgenic mice infected by either genotypes B or C of EV71 viruses were protected from developing HFMD-like and paralytic symptoms. We concluded that treatment of N3 (200 \u00b5g) at an early stage (3 h post infection) after infection afforded complete protection. A lower dose (70 \u00b5g) of N3 treatment at an early stage provided 90% protection. The protection efficacy dropped when N3 was provided at 24 h post infection, even though the multiple administrations of N3 did not rescue the mice from pathogenesis.

Clinical, radiological, and laboratory features indicated that immunpathology resulting in neurological disease were reported in severe cases [33]. Elevated levels of several cytokines and chemokines have been reported in children with brainstem encephalitis and PE [13], [15]. CXCL10, CCL3, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and Type 1 and type II IFNs were found to be significantly elevated in EV71-infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. After N3 treatment, reduction of proinflammatory mediators release was observed (Fig. 7, 8, 9). Moreover, similar results were reported in clinical cases that IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in the blood were significantly decreased in EV71 patients with PE after administration of IVIG. Beside EV71, coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis is primarily attributed to viremic injury, and immune infiltration and reclamation [34], [35]. Both innate immune response and specific host effector mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the CNS of coronavirus infection [36].",

Investigation of the affinity of N3 against CVA16 showed lower reactivity. We have identified that N3 specifically recognized a VP1 epitope (210\u2013225 amino acid of VP1 region or named 776\u2013790 encoded residues of EV71 genome; [17]). In comparison of the recent study [37], alignment of the highly conserved region of VP1 amino acid (200\u2013225) sequences from different EV71 genotypes and CVA16 showed dissimilarity between CVA16 and EV71, which may explain the scenario that N3 failed to cross-neutralize CVA16 was due to the different sequence. The epitope recognized by N3 is also different from the previous report\u2019s epitopes; the mouse anti-sera generated from the peptides, P230\u2013323, P646\u2013755, P857\u20131012 and P1329\u20131440, showed strong staining with neuron plasma in both adult human cerebra and fetus medulla.

This model might serve as an experimental model for aiding the evaluation of anti-EV71 therapeutic medicine. The application of humanized monoclonal antibodies to control various viral infections was reported [39], [40]. Therefore, humanized N3 is expectable to serve as therapeutic agent to treat HFMD diseases in the future.

For protection studies, the purified neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 (20 \u00b5l of 10 mg/mL) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into the mice after 3, 24, and 48 h after infection. Mice were observed for symptom development for 10 days post virus infection. The severity of HFMD-like and paralysis symptoms was scored from 0 to 5 using the following criteria: For HFMD-like symptoms 5 = 80% hair loss associated with scurf (white spots) (HLS), 4 = 50% HLS, 3 = >30% HLS, 2 = >10% HLS, 1 = <10% HLS and 0 = no HLS on the back and abdomen. To score the degree of paralysis, 5 = severe paralyzed front and rear limbs with no movement, 4 = 2 rear limbs were moderately paralyzed with difficulty in movement, 3 = paralyzed rear limbs with bending legs, 2 = mildly bending rear limbs, 1 = slightly bending rear limbs, 0 = no paralyzed limbs with normal movement. The tested animals were euthanized by 100% CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes followed by cervical dislocation after completion of the experimental protocol or when weight loss of 20% occurred (according to the guidelines of approved animal-use protocols; protocol no.
