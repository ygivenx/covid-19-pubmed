Indeed, viral persistence in the CNS represents a challenge both for the host and the pathogen. On the virus side, it is essential to adapt a strategy of replication that will minimize virus-induced cell damage and limit its recognition by the immune response. On the host side, it is essential to quickly halt virus multiplication, while causing minimal damage to CNS resident cells and in particular to neurons which have limited capacities of renewal [1], [2]. These issues are complicated by the unique immunologic properties of the CNS, originally referred to as an immune privileged site. It is now clear that this \u201cprivilege\u201d is very relative and that despite the blood-brain barrier and the absence of dedicated lymphoid drainage [3], the immune response can generally control invasion of the CNS by pathogens, although often at the expense of irremediable tissue damage due to excessive inflammation.",

            "text": "Among the different immune effectors involved in viral elimination, CD8 T cells have received much attention, owing to their essential roles in the primary protection of the host against infectious diseases. CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) mediate their antiviral effects by recognizing viral peptides presented by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC I) molecules. Upon engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) with the peptide-MHC I complex, CTL mediate cell killing essentially through two independent pathways: perforin-dependent delivery of granzymes and interaction of Fas-ligand (FasL) with the Fas-receptor on the target cell surface. These lytic mechanisms could, however, have devastating consequences in the CNS and it has been shown that alternative non-cytolytic mechanisms can also be engaged by CTL [4], [5]. In particular, antiviral cytokines produced by CD8 T cells, such as interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), can stimulate intracellular pathways that interfere with viral replication, resulting in complete or partial clearance from the cell without destroying it. Furthermore, both mechanisms can be combined to limit viral multiplication in the brain. One example is infection with Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), for which latency is controlled by IFN-\u03b3 produced by CD8 T and by granzyme B-mediated degradation of the HSV-1 immediate early protein ICP4 [6], [7].",

            "text": "As recognition of peptide-MHC I complexes is essential to elicit CTL effector functions, it has long been considered that neurons were spared from CD8 T cell attack because they did not express MHC I molecules [8], [9]. Recent studies, however, have challenged this view. First, accumulating evidence has revealed that MHC I expression in the developing and adult CNS can have additional non-immune functions. Indeed, neuronal MHC I molecules appear to be crucial for normal brain development, neuronal differentiation and plasticity [10], [11]. In addition to their role in CNS function, it was also shown that neurons could express MHC I molecules under inflammatory conditions. For example, in Rasmussen's encephalitis, histopathological examination of autopsy material revealed the presence of granzyme B-containing CD8 T cells in direct apposition to MHC I positive neurons [12]. Further evidence of MHC I inducibility in neurons was provided in vitro. Indeed, it has been shown that primary cultures of neurons treated with IFN-\u03b3 and electrically silenced using Tetrodotoxin (TTX) can be induced to express MHC I molecules on their surface [13]. This expression is functionally relevant, as CTL can attack peptide-pulsed neurons in an antigen-specific manner in vitro\n[14]. One caveat of such studies, however, is that they were performed using neurons loaded with non-limiting amounts of exogenous peptides. Moreover, CD8 T cells used in these assays were either CTL clones or lines with pre-defined epitope specificity, often derived for practical reasons from TCR-transgenic animals. CTL were also often further differentiated in vitro or restimulated in culture. Despite the above-mentioned limitations, several studies using variations of this experimental paradigm have provided considerable insight on MHC I-restricted T cell interactions with neurons [2], [15]. One still unsatisfactorily resolved issue in neurovirology, however, is whether antiviral CD8 T cells can indeed recognize and directly attack virus-infected neurons in the course of a natural disease.",

BDV infects the CNS of a wide variety of mammals [18], [19] and induces a large spectrum of neurological disorders [18], [20], [21]. One of the best-investigated animal models for the pathogenesis of BDV infection is the Lewis rat. After intracerebral infection, the rats develop an acute meningo-encephalitis in which the infiltrating immune cells are mainly comprised of CD8 T cells, together with less numerous CD4+ T cells and macrophages [22], [23]. Several studies showing the preferential presence of CD8 T cells in direct proximity to neuronal cell lesions and adoptive transfer experiments have clearly established the central role of CD8 T cells in BDV-induced encephalitis and neuronal destruction [24]\u2013[26].",

We used infected and non-infected neurons, as well as non-infected neurons that had been treated for 72 h with IFN-\u03b3 (100 U/ml) and TTX (1 \u00b5M), to induce MHC I expression [13]. We also used non-infected neurons treated for 72 h with IFN-\u00df (100 U/ml). Living neurons still attached to the plastic were stained using a monoclonal antibody recognizing the rat MHC I RT1-A molecule. After staining, neurons were rapidly harvested, fixed and further stained for the intracellular neuronal protein Tau. Flow cytometry analysis (Figure 1C and D) revealed that cultures contained >98% neurons and that non-infected neurons expressed little or no MHC I molecules (0.5\u00b10.3% positive neurons). As previously published [13], treatment with IFN-\u03b3 and TTX strongly induced MHC I expression (70\u00b15% positive neurons). Interestingly, BDV infection triggered a significant expression of neuronal MHC I (30\u00b13.5% positive neurons). Analysis of fluorescence intensities (Figure 1E) revealed that levels of surface expression of MHC I induced by BDV infection were nevertheless lower than those obtained by neuronal exposure to IFN-\u03b3 and TTX. Of note, treatment of non-infected neurons with IFN-\u00df induced comparable proportion (30\u00b13%) and levels of MHC I expression (Figure 1E) than infection with BDV.",

In previous experiments, we determined that, similar to others [24], [31], this time point corresponded to the peak of the neurological disease caused by BDV infection and that inflammatory infiltrates were most abundant in the brain at this stage [32]. Consistent with previous reports [24], [31], phenotypic characterization of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes using flow cytometry revealed that CD8 T cells accounted for 51%\u00b11.5% of all T cells present in the brain (i.e., positive for the TCR), whereas CD4 T cells represented 30%\u00b13% of TCR+ cells (Figure 2A). This 1.7 to 1 ratio of CD8 to CD4 cells in the brain contrasted with the usual 1 to 3 ratio found in cervical lymph nodes of the same animals, reflecting the high proportion of CD8 T cells recruited to the CNS upon BDV infection. Moreover, this ratio was probably under-estimated since we detected a high proportion of TCR+ cells (\u224820%) that were negative for both CD4 and CD8 expression, presumably due to down-modulation of CD8 expression upon activation [33]. To further analyze the phenotype of CD8 T cells, we purified them using cell sorting (>99% pure), within a few hours after harvesting. We prepared total RNA from sorted CD8 T cells and analyzed expression of several genes by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. When compared to CD8 T cells purified from lymph nodes of the same animals (Figure 2B), brain-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed high levels of effector molecules such as IFN-\u03b3 (300-fold induction on average), Granzyme B (180-fold induction) or FasL (50-fold induction). Expression of Perforin mRNA was also significantly elevated, albeit at lower levels.",

We did not detect any cytokine above the threshold level of detection of the assay (4.88 pg/ml) in the supernatants of CD8 T cells purified from lymph nodes. In contrast, brain-purified CD8 T cells produced high levels of IFN-\u03b3 (up to 9 ng/ml) upon culture with infected neurons (Figure 2D).

To get further insight on the dynamics of interactions between CD8 T cells and neurons, we stained purified CD8 T cells with the lipophilic dye PKH-26, added them to neuronal cultures previously labeled with Calcein-AM and performed confocal microscopy imaging using a temperature-controlled imaging setup (Figure 3, video S1 and video S2). Strikingly, the mobility of CD8 T cells isolated from the brain was extremely reduced upon incubation with BDV-infected neurons compared to non-infected ones (Figure 3A and 3B). Indeed, the measured mean velocity was 2.83 \u00b5m/min (95% confidence interval (CI) of mean 2.59 - 3.03) in the presence of infected neurons compared to 15.27 \u00b5m/min, (95% CI 13.00\u201317.53) with non-infected ones (Figure 3C and 3D). Furthermore, once arrested, CD8 T cells established stable interactions with BDV-infected neurons throughout the whole imaging period (up to 45 min). CD8 T cells were found in apposition to neurites and neuronal somas. In contrast, the same brain CD8 T cells exhibited a much more dynamic behavior upon incubation with non-infected neurons. Induction of MHC I expression at the surface of non-infected neurons with IFN-\u03b3 and TTX was not sufficient to arrest CD8 T cells (mean velocity 14.84 \u00b5m/min, 95% CI 11.60\u201318.07). Conversely, masking MHC I molecules on BDV-infected neurons using OX-18 antibody restored a high mobility of CD8 T cells (16.62 \u00b5m/min, 95% CI 14.24\u201319.00). In addition, relative frequencies of CD8 T cell moving at various velocities were similar when comparing non-infected neurons, non-infected neurons treated with IFN-\u03b3 and TTX or BDV-infected neurons treated with anti-MHC I antibody (Figure 3D). Finally, CD8 T cells purified from cervical lymph nodes of the same infected animals were highly mobile, regardless of whether they were assayed on infected or non-infected neurons (video S3 and data not shown). Collectively, these data show that CD8 T cells freshly purified from BDV-infected rat brains establish stable conjugates with infected neurons and that this interaction depends upon both neuronal infection and MHC I expression.",

Upon incubation with CD8 T cells, calcein beading figures were observed throughout the culture, affecting both neurites and neuronal somas, without any noticeable proximity with the sites of CD8 T cell interaction with neurons (video S8). In order to quantify this phenomenon, neurons were imaged for 45 minutes after addition of brain CD8 T cells and levels of calcein fluorescence measured at the beginning of the experiment were subtracted from levels obtained at the end of the incubation. The resulting differences in fluorescent signals therefore provided a good estimate of calcein beading (Figure 4C and 4D). While there were only minimal changes when brain CD8 T cells were applied to non-infected neurons, we detected significant residual fluorescence when using BDV-infected neurons. Consistent with a role of CD8-neuron cognate interaction in this process, incubation of BDV-infected neurons with anti-MHC I antibody markedly decreased calcein beading (Figure 4D).",

We assessed the impact of incubation with CD8 T cells by measuring the frequency of grouped action potentials, or bursts, over the neuronal network (Figure 5B). Before adding CD8 T cells, spontaneous firing frequencies were similar whether neurons were infected or not with BDV (0.037\u00b10.0008 Hz vs. 0.038\u00b10.0011 Hz), in agreement with our previous studies [28], [30]. Upon addition of brain-purified CD8 T cells (at a ratio of 1 to 1), the electrophysiological properties of non-infected neurons remained remarkably stable throughout the whole experiment (0.038\u00b10.0038 Hz after 6 h of incubation). In sharp contrast, the addition of CD8 T cells to BDV-infected neurons triggered a significant increase of the mean burst frequency, which doubled to attain 0.074\u00b10.0038 Hz. Remarkably, the neuronal network remained electrically active up to 3 h after addition of CD8 T cells. Thereafter, we witnessed a decline of the firing pattern, with neurons becoming nearly completely silent by 6 h of incubation (Figure 5B).",

The fluorescent probe FLICA, which involves covalent binding of fluorescent Z-VAD to activated caspases, was used to detect activation of caspases 3 and 7 in live neurons. The intensity of fluorescent signals therefore provided a direct quantification of apoptosis (Figure 6). Consistent with the maintenance of their electrical activity, we did not detect significant apoptosis in non-infected neurons, even 4 h after addition of brain CD8 T cells. BDV-infected neurons did not display any caspase induction up to 2 h after incubation with CD8 T cells, but after 4 h we detected a strong increase in fluorescence, indicating prominent neuronal apoptosis. This observation was consistent with the delayed loss of electrical activity at longer time points of incubation (Figure 5B). At longer time points, we noted a progressive disaggregation of the neuronal network, which was however apparent only 6 to 8 hours after incubation with CD8 T cells (data not shown). Pre-incubation of BDV-infected neurons with anti-MHC I antibody significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis (Figure 6), further indicating that neuronal attack by CD8 T cells is a process which depends on the recognition of MHC I/viral antigen complexes at the surface of neurons.",

            "text": "Our findings that BDV infection triggers MHC I expression by neurons were surprising. In general, viruses are better known for their capacity to down regulate or prevent the expression of MHC I molecules on the cell surface, through the expression of immunomodulatory viral proteins. Relevant examples of such proteins include HIV Nef, KSHV MIR1 and MIR2, myxoma virus MV-Lap or several CMV proteins [39]\u2013[41]. These mechanisms of control should theoretically be even tighter in neurons, which are less prone to express MHC I molecules. Nevertheless, in the case of Flaviviruses such as West-Nile virus, it has been previously shown that CD8 T cells could recognize and destroy infected neurons, although expression of MHC I molecules was not formally assessed [42], [43]. There may be several non-exclusive mechanisms to explain our findings. First, as impairment of neuronal electrical activity has been shown to induce MHC I expression, one hypothesis is that BDV infection may trigger MHC I expression through its effects on neuronal activity. Indeed, we have previously shown that BDV can impair synaptic plasticity [28], [30] and these electrophysiological alterations could play a role in MHC I induction. Alternatively, BDV infection of neurons could trigger the production of type-1 interferons, which in turn, could induce MHC I expression. Recent evidence has clearly demonstrated that neurons can take part to the antiviral defense by being both IFN-\u03b1/\u00df producers and responders [44]. In addition, it is now well established that IFN-\u03b1/\u00df can induce detectable levels of MHC I expression by neurons, although not as efficiently as IFN-\u03b3 [1]. The fact that levels of MHC I expression induced by BDV were similar to those obtained upon exogenous application of IFN-\u00df (Figure 1D and 1E) provides indirect evidence in support of this hypothesis. Also consistent with these findings, a microarray analysis provided experimental evidence of a type-1 interferon signature in BDV-infected neurons (Table S1). We also confirmed our microarray data by demonstrating the up regulation of interferon-stimulated genes in BDV-infected neurons, by using both real-time quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses (Figure S2). Given that our neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic (E18) cortical tissue and further cultured for a few weeks, we cannot exclude the possibility that our neurons may behave differently than fully mature neurons, in particular regarding their MHC I inducibility.",

These findings uncover a novel aspect of neuro-immune interactions and reveal that neurons can process and present antigenic peptides to CTL, an aspect which could not be assessed in experimental systems using peptide-pulsed neurons. This is also consistent with previous reports showing that neurons express different components of the molecular machinery required for epitope processing and MHC I presentation, such as TAP1/TAP2 and LMP2/LMP7 [45], [46]. Based on our cytokine secretion data and imaging studies, antigen processing and MHC I presentation by neurons are clearly functionally relevant. Indeed, CTL arrest and the ensuing changes in neuronal permeability and apoptosis were all significantly prevented or delayed by the addition of an antibody masking MHC I molecules. Interestingly, brain-infiltrating CD8 T cells produced the cytokine IL-10 in addition to IFN-\u03b3 at the peak of BDV-induced encephalitis. Similar observations have been made recently in a Coronavirus-induced encephalitis model [47]. This secretion of IL-10 has been interpreted as a mechanism protecting critical organs from bystander tissue injury, while permitting viral clearance [47], [48].",

In particular, they have been visualized in neurons following axonal transection and Wallerian degeneration [49], oxidative stress [50], ischemia [51], trauma [52] or even allogeneic CTL [53]. Although the underlying mechanism is not well understood, it seems to be accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction and delayed cell death. Recently, it was suggested that calcein leakage from neurons following oxygen-glucose deprivation could result from opening of neuronal hemichannels, a type of half-gap junctions that form large-conductance channels and allow flux of ions and molecules [51].

This contrasted with the immediate shutdown of electrical signaling, both in single neurons and networks, which follows incubation of OVA peptide-pulsed neurons with primed OT-I cells, as recently described by Meuth et al. [15]. Since neurons were killed rapidly upon recognition by highly differentiated CD8 OT-I cells, our observations suggest that impairment of electrical activity upon CTL encounter may also be dependent on the intensity of the \u201clethal hit\u201d delivered by the CTL. Indeed, the different kinetics of CTL engagement with neurons in our system is probably related to the fact that CD8 T cells purified for the brains of BDV-infected rats were not subjected to further in vitro stimulation and that the neurons were undergoing a natural viral infection, with the density of MHC I / cognate peptides being closer to physiological levels.",

CD8 T cells purified from brains of BDV-infected rats expressed all cytolytic effectors, including IFN-\u03b3, perforin, granzyme-B or FasL. Both Fas/FasL and perforin/granzyme pathways have been demonstrated to be effective against neurons upon engagement with CTL [14], [54], [55]. Since cell death appears to develop with slower kinetics when triggered through the Fas/FasL pathway [56], [57], given our observations that BDV-infected neurons are still electrically active after three hours, we would favor the hypothesis that killing of BDV-infected neurons preferentially occurs by this route. However, previous studies in the rat model of BDV infection have also shown expression of perforin mRNA in the brain [24]. Alternatively, the relatively low density of MHC I expression triggered by infection, together with a restricted expression of perforin could lead to a limited release of cytolytic granules towards the infected neurons. Finally, protection against excessive apoptosis may also be conferred by BDV infection per se. Recently, it was shown by Poenisch et al. that the BDV X protein could protect cells against Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro [58]. In our system, however, the kinetics or characteristics of CTL-induced apoptosis were unchanged when we used neurons infected with the BDV-X(A6A7) mutant [58], which has lost its capacity to block Fas-induced apoptosis in vitro, resulting from loss of the mitochondrial localization of the X protein (Figure S3).",

            "text": "Our findings have several important implications. First, we confirmed the capacity of neurons to process and viral antigens during the course of a natural infection, leading to simulation of CD8 T cells and production of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, beyond being the mere targets of CD8-mediated cytotoxicity, neurons may play an active part in the development of CNS inflammation through T cell activation and cytokine release. Second, the slow kinetics of neuronal death suggests that this progressive neuronal loss of function may leave open a window of opportunity for future treatments. Very recently, it was shown that the immune-mediated axonal damage that develops during autoimmune encephalomyelitis (in mice) or multiple sclerosis (in humans) was a slow and likely reversible process [59]. These authors described this process as \u201cfocal axonal degeneration\u201d, beginning with axonal swelling and mitochondrial dysfunction, very reminiscent of the axonal beading phenomenon described herein. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in our system may provide novel putative targets that could then be tested in other systems triggering axonal death, be they virally-mediated or not.",

Half of the MEA dishes were infected with BDV on day 1. After addition of highly purified CD8 T cells (at a ratio of one CD8 T cell per neuron), signals corresponding to the electrical activity from the 60 electrodes of the MEA were recorded using the MC Rack Software (Multi Channel Systems GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany), which allows both online visualization and raw data storage. The signal corresponding to the firing of a single action potential by a neuron in the vicinity of an electrode was identified as a spike. We also detected high frequency grouped spikes trains, known as bursts, which represent an important parameter of the analysis of neuronal network activity [64]. Bursts were defined as a series of more than 3 spikes occurring in less than 100 ms. Spikes and bursts were detected by a dedicated analysis software developed at INSERM U862 (Bordeaux, France) [35], which computes the signal obtained from the electrodes, calculates a threshold and detects a spike every time the signal crosses this threshold with a negative slope. The threshold was set to a minimum of three standard deviations of the average noise amplitude computed over the whole recording and applied from the signal averaged value as a baseline [65]. For each time point, recordings were performed over a 3 min period, and the mean burst frequency was calculated by averaging the results obtained for all electrodes.",
