A recent study reported a fused RNA segment for PBV in horse16. Based on the amino acid sequence of the RdRp, PBVs are classified into five genogroups: GI, GII17, GIII18, GIV and GV16. The intra-genogroup and inter-genogroup sequence similarities of the RdRp nucleic acid fragment range from 49 to 100% and 28 to 37%, respectively17. PBVs are frequently detected in fecal samples from mammals, birds, and wild animals, as well as environmental samples and in immunocompromised patients as an opportunistic diarrhea-causing pathogen19, 20. In this study, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we studied the RNA virome of M. himalayana and identified and characterized novel PBVs in this species, including bi-segmented and unsegmented genomes of PBVs. A putative model of PBV genome segmentation was also proposed.",

In addition, we obtained complete or nearly complete genome sequences for 13 new mammalian RNA viruses of three families, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, and Caliciviridae (Supplementary Table S1). The polyproteins of Marmot sapalovirus HT5 and HT6 showed 54 and 56% amino acid sequence similarities to the genera Enterovirus and Sapelovirus, respectively, which are proposed new species of the Enterovirus/Sapelovirus supergroup (www.picornaviridae.com). The polyproteins of Marmot cardiovirus HT7 and Marmot mosavirus HT8 showed 59 and 46% amino acid sequence similarities to those of the viruses of the genera Cardiovirus and Mosavirus, respectively, which are considered new members of Cardiovirus and Mosavirus.",

Unlike the conventional two-segment genomes of PBVs (Fig. 3a), we found four unsegmented genomes (named Marmot PBV HT1-4) (Fig. 3b, GenBank accession no. KY855428-KY855431). A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bridging segment 1 and 2 was performed with two pairs of primers (Supplementary Table S2). The expected PCR product was sequenced, and the truth of the junction between both segments was confirmed. The four unsegmented genomes were also confirmed by re-sequencing. The junction sequences linking both segments of Marmot PBV HT1-4 were of 20, 14, 12, and 19-bp, respectively (Fig. 3b). Overall, 20 of 50 (40%), 17 of 24 (71%) and 104 of 117 (88%) intestinal samples from Zhongda, Deda, Dezhuotan, respectively, were positive for unsegmented PBVs (Fig. 1).",

This recombination was reflected not only in the different phylogenetic trees between the two genes but also in the marked diversity of capsid protein sequences. The four Marmot PBVs were dispersed within the segmented PBVs in phylogenetic trees (Fig. 4a), which suggests that multiple segmentation events might have occurred frequently.",

A motif GDD at the 472 site was conserved among all RdRp regions, whereas no conserved motifs were found among the capsid proteins. Of interest, the number of ExxRxNxxxE motifs was variable in ORF1-encoded proteins of marmot PBV sequences, ranging from 0 to 16. Half (~56%) of these proteins had three to six ExxRxNxxxE motifs, whereas ten of them did not possess this motif (Supplementary Figure S4).",

Therefore, we proposed that the segmentation of unsegmented PBVs was mediated by GAAAGG (Fig. 5). This is supported by the finding that 57 of 80 segment 2 sequences (covering all six genotypes of RdRp) had the GAAAGG motif in their 5\u2032 UTRs (Fig. 5). This motif was also detected in 221 of 289 segment 1 sequences (covering all eight clusters classified) (Fig. 5). Direct repeat sequences have been identified in DNA viruses, RNA viruses or phages10, 32\u201337. Direct repeat sequences evolved through multiple duplications, deletions, and mutations of a primordial sequence element in tick-borne flaviviruses33. Interestingly, of 289 segment 1 sequences with the GAAAGG motif, 143, 73, and 5 had one, two, and three copies, respectively, in their 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 5). Among the 80 segment 2 sequences with the GAAAGG motif, 55 and 4 had one and two copies, respectively, in their 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 5). The specific mechanism by which GAAAGG-mediated genome segmentation occurs needs to be further studied.",
