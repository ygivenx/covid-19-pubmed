Sporadic occurrence of the disease has been reported globally since first reported in New Zealand in 1957, but larger outbreaks with higher morbidity and mortality have increased recently in the Asian Pacific region, including an outbreak in Fuyang, China, that affected close to a half million children with 126 deaths in 2008 [1]. Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) are the causative agents for HFMD, accounting for over 70% of cases during the outbreak in China in 2008 [2]. The viruses are members of the Picornaviridae family and are spread through contact with virus-containing body fluids, respiratory droplets, and feces. There are no vaccine or antiviral drugs available for HFMD. Although immunoglobulin and antiviral agent ribavirin are commonly used, the efficacy remains uncertain [3, 4]. Good personal hygiene, including hand washing and disinfection of surfaces in child care facilities, remains therefore as the most effective approach to reduce the transmission rate of HFMD [5, 6].",

Some of the herbs or herbal preparations have been shown to ameliorate the symptoms and others to shorten the course of the disease [7]. There was no definitive description of symptoms related to HFMD in ancient manuscripts and publications in China until recent outbreaks of the disease. To deal with the clinical manifestations characterized with mild fever and rash, practitioners of Chinese medicine reasoned and have effectively treated HFMD as dampness and damp heat. We compiled a list of commonly used herbs with implication for HFMD therapy (Table 1) from a list of recommended remedies by government agencies in China and from published reports [7\u20139]. Most of the herbs in Table 1 have traditionally or folklorically been used for inflammatory or infective diseases. In addition, most of the herbs listed in Table 1 have not been investigated for their antiviral activity against pathogens of HFMD disease, although some of them have demonstrated antiviral activity. Less is known about the active components of those plants.",

Although some minerals like gypsum mineral (CaSO4\n\u00b72H2O) and talcum powder (magnesium silicate hydrate) or insect molting from cicada have been prescribed for HFMD, we focused our investigation on herbal medicines.

Subsequently, the material was warmed up to 65\u00b0C in a water bath and extracted for 4 hr. The material was extracted one more time, and the pooled liquid fractions were left at RT for overnight to let insoluble materials settle down. Finally, water soluble materials were separated from the insoluble debris by centrifugation (5000 \u00d7g, 15 min). The major chemical components in those extracts were validated following protocols given in Chinese Pharmacopeia (2010 ed.). Those showed that antiviral activities were further studied to validate the presence of characteristic chemicals in the plants following some literatures (e.g., used HPLC profiling for H. cordata and M. haplocalyx). The water extracts were then dried by lyophilization. The lyophilized powders were stored at \u221270\u00b0C and dissolved in distilled water to make stocks of 20 mg/mL before experiments.",

At up to 1000 \u03bcg/mL concentrations, all extracts except that from Scutellaria baicalensis showed no cytotoxic effect in Vero cells. Scutellaria baicalensis extract started to show toxic effect at approximately 100 \u03bcg/mL in Vero cells with an estimated CC50 value of 240.2 \u03bcg/mL. To assay for their antiviral activity against EV71 and CVA16 infection, monolayers of Vero cells were treated with an extract at 1000 \u03bcg/mL or with Scutellaria baicalensis extract at a nontoxic concentration of 30 \u03bcg/mL for 2 hr or remained untreated. The cells were then infected with EV71 or CVA16 (MOI = 0.2) for 72 hr. At the end of an infection, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde and examined visually for cytopathic effect. Although recommended or widely used for HFMD disease, only three materials showed moderate to strong activity against EV71 or CVA16 infection (Table 1). The extract of Houttuynia cordata significantly blocked the cytopathic effect associated with EV71. The extract did not exhibit significant activity against CVA16 infection. In contrast, MHB treatment significantly blocked the cytopathic effect by CVA16 but not by EV71 infection. An extract from Glycyrrhiza uralensis was reported with strong activity against EV71 infection [22]. We found that the extract was marginally active against EV71 and CVA16 infection. Further studies demonstrated that glycyrrhizic acid possessed anti-EV71 activity and anti-CVA16 activity at millimolar concentrations.",

The production of IL-6 and IL-8 is regulated transcriptionally by NF-\u03baB pathway, whose activation can be assayed by monitoring the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, the inhibitory protein of NF-\u03baB activity. We next investigated whether the extracts from commonly used herbs for HFMD had activity in suppressing inflammatory response by investigating whether the extracts blocked I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. As shown in Figure 4, EV71 and CVA16 infection promoted I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation at approximately 10 hr PI (Figures 4(a) and 4(d)). Consistent with the results from antiviral studies, pretreatment of Vero cells with HCT or MHB blocked I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation caused by EV71 and CVA16 infection (Figures 4(b) and 4(e)), respectively. In addition, the extracts also showed inhibitory activity against TNF\u03b1-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation (Figures 4(c) and 4(f)), indicating that the extracts had activity against proinflammatory factor stimulation.",

The medicinal use of this plant includes its antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and febrifuge activities. In a previous study, Lin et al. identified Houttuynia cordata as the only material with activity against EV71 infection among 22 medicinally used herbs from Taiwan. Consistent with the observation by Lin et al. [21], we also found that the water extract from Houttuynia cordata was active against CVA16, extending the antiviral spectrum of this plant. Unlike other widely used herbs, Houttuynia cordata was recommended for treatment of HFMD with severe syndrome by the Government of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a region with relatively low rate of HFMD incidences and death. Furthermore, the plant contains flavonoids and undecanone. In a preliminary screening study, we failed to detect any antiviral activity with those compounds. Instead, we found that activity was stable against heat and can be extracted out to n-butanol fraction. Further study is warranted to identify the active components from this plant.",
