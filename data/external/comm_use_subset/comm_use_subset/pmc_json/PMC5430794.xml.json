In July 1984, Taiwan launched a nationwide HB vaccination program for infants born to HBV carrier mothers, primarily to interrupt vertical transmission. Two years later, the vaccination program extended the coverage to all newborns, and also gave hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) injections to the newborns of HBeAg-positive mothers within 24 hours after birth. Thus Taiwan was the first country to introduce an HB vaccination program in the world5. The program as then further extended to cover all preschool children in 1987, primary-school children in 1988, and middle-school children in 1989, resulting in a high national coverage rate in the targeted cohort of 92.8% by 20026.",

Previous studies have reported a decrease in the prevalence of HBeAg among pregnant women in Taiwan during the 1990s10, 11; however, trends in those vaccinated after the introduction of the vaccination program have yet to be reported. Since the vaccinated cohort are now of child-bearing age, we aimed to investigate the effect of the universal HBV vaccination program in Taiwan on this cohort, including the trend of HBeAg prevalence during the 2000s. Moreover, during the past decade an increasing number of foreign spouses have immigrated to Taiwan, mostly from China and other Southeast Asian countries with a high prevalence of HBV infection12, 13. Therefore, we also aimed to investigate the status of HBV infection among Taiwanese pregnant women and those from other Asian countries in order to explore the potential impact of foreign immigration on public health in Taiwan.",

We found a dramatic decrease in the HBsAg-positive rate to 2.6% in the vaccinated parturients, suggesting that the universal immunization program was successful in reducing the rate of perinatal infection. Interestingly, we also noted a decrease in the prevalence rate of HBsAg among the group born before the universal vaccination program was launched, suggesting the protective impact of the additional vaccination since 1987 on pre-school and middle school children. Similar results were also reported by a systematic review reporting the prevalence of HBV infection in two time periods (1990 and 2005)17. Moreover, owing to efforts on primary strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk of HBV transmission from nosocomial exposure (e.g. screening for safe blood and blood products for transfusion, use of disposable syringes and needles and universal precautions), the risk of hepatitis B infection as well as super-infections with hepatitis D virus among HBV carriers has dramatically decreased, which also had a protective impact on the unvaccinated cohort18, 19.",

The reported factors associated with early HBeAg clearance include age, parity, HBV genotype, pretreatment low serum HBV DNA level, molecular virological factors as well as the degree of both biochemical and histologic activity22\u201325. Lin et al. reported that the positive HBeAg rate in Taiwanese parturients from 1985 and 1990 decreased from 49.4% in those aged 21\u201325 years to 20% in those aged >35 years11. Lu et al. also reported a similar decline with advanced age in the 1990s10. In the current study, the HBeAg-positive rate among the HBsAg-positive mothers still declined with increasing age in the past 10 years, and it is encouraging that the prevalence was much lower than in the equivalent group in the 1990s.",

We found that the foreign parturients had higher HBeAg prevalence and delayed HBeAg clearance rates compared to the Taiwanese mothers. Despite World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations that HBV vaccines should have been incorporated into routine childhood immunization programs by 1997, and that the primary strategy to control HBV infection is universal infant immunization, some countries have not been able to afford to implement such measures as early as recommended29, 30. Chu et al. reported a change in the epidemiology of hepatitis B related to migration by comparing six northern and north-western European countries31. Their results showed evident differences in the HBsAg prevalence rate between the migrants and general population, which the authors concluded was because most of the migrants acquired the infection in early childhood in their country of birth. In Taiwan, most foreign mothers come from China and Vietnam. China launched a nationwide HBV vaccination program in 200232, and Vietnam\u2019s National Expanded Program on Immunization (NEPI) introduced hepatitis B vaccines in 1997. However, a number of infant deaths in 2006 were linked to the HBV vaccine in Vietnam, hence its coverage rate was only 20% by 200833. This may explain why we found higher HBeAg prevalence and delayed HBeAg clearance rates in the foreign parturients than in those born in Taiwan. This issue cannot be ignored, and different strategies should be considered for HBV infection surveillance in the migrant population34.",
