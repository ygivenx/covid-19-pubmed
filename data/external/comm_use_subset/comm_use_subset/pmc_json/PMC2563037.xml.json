            "text": "Despite the antigenic complexity of microbes, primary pathogen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are commonly directed to just one or a few determinants. Furthermore, even when multiple epitopes are targeted, distinct patterns of epitope hierarchy often emerge. Such immunodominant epitopes commonly elicit high-magnitude CTL responses characterized by potent cytolytic function, whereas subdominant determinants generate responses that are relatively lower in magnitude and often less efficacious. In general, potent anti-viral CTL strongly correlate with control of infection and less clinical disease. Viral progeny selected on the basis of CTL surveillance can evolve to evade T cell responses. This selective pressure results in mutations in immunodominant CTL determinants that abrogate recognition. CTL escape virus is commonly observed in humans and nonhuman primates infected with HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its selection often correlates with disease progression [1]\u2013[4]. Escape mutations may diminish binding to the restricting MHC class I molecule, interfere with T cell receptor (TcR) recognition or interfere with antigen processing [5]\u2013[7]. Escape mutations are usually detected in epitopes targeted by CTL that exhibit high functional avidity because the corresponding potent CTL response exerts high selective pressure on the virus [2]. In some HIV-infected patients, CTL escape occurs without an associated enhancement of virus replication, suggesting that the mutations compromised virus fitness or, alternatively, the variant determinant elicited a de novo CTL response [8],[9]. Virus fitness is sometimes restored, with concomitant increased virus replication, when a second, compensatory mutation is selected [10],[11]. Collectively these results suggest that given the importance of virus diversification (CTL escape) in disease progression, suppression of selection or outgrowth of CTL escape variants should improve outcomes in persistently infected animals and humans.",

Enhancement strategies, which result in augmented responses to the native, subdominant epitope, have been described for both MHC class I and class II-restricted determinants, whereby the most common approaches involve generating a series of conserved and non-conserved mutations at MHC anchor residues, followed by an empiric determination of whether each individual substitution augments T cell effector function [12]. Furthermore, evaluating the effect of epitope enhancement in vivo has generally been achieved via heterologous infection systems [13]\u2013[15]. Thus, while these results demonstrate proof of principle, direct evidence for enhanced protection against autologous microbial infection in vivo is lacking. The design of heteroclitic determinants in which non-MHC anchor residues are targeted for substitution are also usually determined empirically. Studies of heteroclitic tumor epitopes have demonstrated the clinical utility of such determinants [16],[17]. Notably, however, there are no well defined examples of viral epitopes which demonstrate enhanced immunity and the molecular basis for the enhanced immunogenicity is not well understood.",

            "text": "Potential interventions to directly manipulate host-pathogen interactions and thereby diminish CTL escape variant selection are often difficult to evaluate since most examples of CTL escape occur in infected humans or non-human primates. By contrast, mice persistently infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM (JHMV) serve as a useful system for investigating anti-viral CTL responses and CTL escape [18]\u2013[20]. Two JHMV-derived CTL epitopes are recognized in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. The immunodominant H-2Db-restricted CTL epitope (S510, CSLWNGPHL, spanning residues 510\u2013518 of the Spike (S) glycoprotein) elicits a high-magnitude, high-avidity CTL response that drives virus diversification during persistent infection [18]\u2013[22]. A second subdominant CTL epitope, S598 (H-2Kb-restricted, RCQIFANI, spanning residues 598\u2013605 of the S glycoprotein) also elicits an appreciable CTL response [21]; however, S598-specific CTL exhibit \u223c100-fold lower functional avidity and do not protect from CTL escape in S510. The presence of a readily mutable dominant and a subdominant epitope with high and low functional avidity, respectively, in JHMV-infected mice is useful for investigating both epitope enhancement and approaches to diminishing CTL escape. Consistent with this notion, we have previously shown that the introduction of a second dominant CD8 T cell epitope into the JHMV genome (GP33 from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)) protected mice from the development of CTL escape in S510 and enhanced virus clearance [22].",

Importantly, Gln-3 diverges from the consensus H-2Kb-restricted ligand binding motif, in which a tyrosine is often present at position 3 [24],[25]. Therefore, we substituted a glutamine residue for tyrosine (Q600Y, CAA to TAT, RCYIFANI) at position 3 of the determinant with the aim of creating a peptide that bound more tightly to H-2Kb. Stability of the H-2Kb/S598 and H-2Kb/S598Q600Y complexes was assessed by circular dichroism (CD). As shown in \nFigure 1\n, H-2Kb/S598Q600Y was considerably more thermostable than the native complex (Tm 54\u00b0C vs 64\u00b0C). To probe the biological properties of the Q600Y substitution, we used reverse genetics to engineer a recombinant version of JHMV expressing the S598Q600Y epitope (\nFigure 2A\n). Recombinant viruses encoding this substitution replicated as efficiently as wild type JHMV (rJ) in vitro during one-step growth kinetics analyses and in vivo virus competition assays (\nFigure 2B, C\n). The immunogenicity of S598Q600Y was assessed by intracellular expression of IFN-\u03b3 by central nervous system (CNS)-derived lymphocytes. Since Cys-containing peptides are often diminished in ability to elicit a CTL response, we included a reducing agent (TCEP, Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine) in the cultures. TCEP enhanced the stimulatory capacity of the S598 peptides (\nFigure S1B\n), indicating that a proportion of the unmodified S598 peptide stock had undergone oxidation. Thus, we stimulated CNS- and spleen-derived CTL ex vivo in the presence of 500 \u00b5M TCEP, a concentration consistent with other work with Cys containing peptides [23],[26].",

Also consistent with this observation, alanine scanning mutagenesis of the two determinants revealed that the CTL response to each cognate peptide following infection was also subtly different reflecting the altered repertoire. The CTL response to each cognate peptide was very sensitive to mutation at every position except 2 and 9 although mutations in the S598Q600Y determinant were tolerated slightly better than changes in the S598 epitope (\nFigure S2C\u2013E\n).",

Diversification at S510 is observed in pups infected with neurovirulent JHMV at 10 days of age and nursed by JHMV-immune dams [27]. These mice are largely protected from developing acute lethal encephalitis, but a variable percentage (30\u201390%) later develop a demyelinating encephalomyelitis. Infectious virus isolated from these mice with late onset clinical disease is mutated in S510, resulting in enhanced virus replication [20], with demyelination occurring during the process of virus clearance [28]. Thus, we next infected maternal antibody-protected suckling mice with rJ or rJ.SQ600Y viruses and monitored persistently infected mice for the development of clinical signs for 60 days post infection (p.i.). The presence of the highly immunogenic S598Q600Y epitope did not protect mice from acute encephalitis (\nFigure 3E\n), perhaps because the presence of the improved S598 epitope was accompanied by a diminished response to S510 (\nFigure 2D\n). However, we found that among survivors (defined as survival past day 14 p.i.) there was a significant reduction in the incidence of clinical disease as well as in the development of CTL escape in S510 (\nTable 1\n). Additionally, S598Q600Y did not undergo CTL escape in mice persistently infected with rJ.SQ600Y, even though single nucleotide changes in the region of the S glycoprotein gene encoding the S598 determinant could potentially result in fifty-one CTL escape mutations. Thus, as expected, the \u201cimproved\u201d S598Q600Y epitope was protective in vivo in infected mice, likely because S598Q600Y-specific CTL are present in higher numbers and exhibit higher functional avidity than the native S598-specific response.",

The CTL response is predicted to be largely directed at S598Q600Y in mice infected with this virus. The W513R mutation (position 4 substitution in S510 epitope, CSLRNGPHL) occurs in 13% of all CTL escape variants [19],[20],[22],[29],[30], and completely abrogates native S510 CTL recognition [31]. We verified that virus-specific CTL responses were focused on S598Q600Y in adult B6 mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y (\nFigure 3F\n). To examine the phenotype of the S598Q600Y/S510W513R double mutant, we infected antibody-protected suckling B6 mice with this virus and appropriate controls and monitored mice for survival (\nFigure 3G\n). As expected, 93.3% of mice infected with rJ survived the acute infection (day 0\u201314 p.i.). All mice infected with rJ.SW513R developed fatal encephalitis but, in marked contrast, 66.6% of mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y survived. We also found that survival correlated with virus clearance (\nFigure 3H\n). Relative to rJ-infected mice, replication was suppressed in mice infected with virus encoding the S598Q600Y epitope and greatly elevated in mice infected with rJ.SW513R. In mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y, virus titers were intermediate between rJ and rJ.SW513R. Thus, the presence of the heteroclitic S598Q600Y determinant contributed to suppression of virus replication and to increased survival, even when the high-magnitude, high-avidity CTL response to S510 was largely abrogated.",

Seven days later, mice were challenged via intranasal inoculation of 4\u00d7104 PFU of wild type, non-recombinant JHMV. Similar to results observed following rJ.SQ600Y infection (\nFigure 3\n), CTL primed via DC-S598Q600Y vaccination exhibited higher functional avidity when reacted against the native S598 determinant when compared to those arising after DC-S598 vaccination (\n\nFigure 4A\n\n). In other experiments, we examined the survival of mice vaccinated with each determinant, but we observed no significant differences between groups (data not shown), probably because mortality is largely CD4 T cell-mediated in adult mice with acute encephalitis [33],[34]. In terms of virus titers, vaccination with either the native or enhanced S598 determinants resulted in \u223c70\u201380% reduction in virus burden compared to mice that received un-pulsed BMDC (\nFigure 4B\n). When we examined the frequency and numbers of virus-specific CTL in the CNS of these same mice, we detected markedly fewer S598-specific CTL in the CNS of mice that received BMDC pulsed with S598Q600Y peptides (\nFigure 4C\n). Calculation of the product of virus titers and CTL numbers within individual mice, as an approximate measure of CTL potency, indicated that the S598-specific CTL in S598Q600Y-coated BMDC vaccinees were \u223c6-7-fold more efficacious on a per cell basis (\nFigure 4D\n). Thus, S598-specific CTL induced by the S598Q600Y determinant show similar enhancement in function compared to S598-primed cells, whether measured in vitro (\nFigure 3C,D\n) or in vivo (\nFigure 4D\n).",

The structure of H-2Kb/S598 consists of two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (r.m.s.d. of 0.18 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms), with the S598 peptide clearly bound in the antigen binding cleft of the heavy chains (HC, \nFigure S3A\n). The two peptide copies display a virtually identical configuration with root mean square deviation (rmsd) values of only 0.09 \u00c5 for all peptide atoms (0.05 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms). The mode of S598 and S598Q600Y binding within the Ag-binding cleft is unambiguous, with the exception of Arg-1, whose side chain is partially disordered (\nFigure 5A,D\n\n\n; Figure S3C\n). The S598 peptide adopts an extended conformation, with the side chains of Arg-1, Ile-4 and Asn-7 extending prominently out of the cleft (\nFigure 5C\n). Ala-6 is also largely solvent exposed with its side chain pointing towards the \u03b12 helix, while the side chains of Cys (Aba)-2, Gln-3, Phe-5 and Ile-8 are buried within the cleft. While the cysteine analogue's side chain is not involved in any hydrophilic interactions, there are a number of suitably positioned hydrogen bonding partners (Glu-24, Tyr-45 and Asn-70), with which the original thiol side chain could potentially interact (Figure S3B; Table S2).",

In particular, changes in the conformation of Ser-99, Gln-114, and Gly-151-Glu-154 are associated with the bound peptides. Changes in the side chain conformations of Ser-99 and Gln-114 in the Q600Y complex structure are consistent with the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions with position 3. In the wild type peptide structure, Glu-152 forms a salt bridge with Arg-155, the guanadinium group of which also forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl group of the peptide's Ile-4. While these interactions are maintained in the Q600Y complex, the side chain of Glu-152 displays a conformational shift consistent with the formation of a hydrogen bond with the peptide's Tyr-3 (\nFigure 6\n). Interestingly the region of the \u03b1-2 helix around Glu-152 (Gly-151 - Glu-154) also displays significant main chain and side chain deviations between the two structures (rmsd of 0.77 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms; \nFigure 6\n). Thus, consistent with the functional analyses, the structure of the heteroclitic variant of the S598 epitope displays relatively small changes in conformation yet the combination of these subtle changes in the TcR accessible residues and the structural landscape of the MHCp in addition to the enhanced stability of the complex lead to more efficacious CTL responses.",

Replacement of the Gln-3 with Tyr-3 (Q600Y) did, indeed, result in an determinant with increased thermostability without diminishing the CD8 T cell response. Most strikingly, the Q600Y change resulted in subtle changes in the conformation of the \u03b1-2 helix locally in the vicinity of Glu-152.

Assuming that low affinity for MHC class I results in a low effective concentration of H-2Kb/S598 complex on the cell surface, the responding T cells should be high avidity, based, primarily, on in vitro studies [37]. While the relationship between level of surface peptide and avidity of the responding T cells generated in vivo is not as clearcut [38], there is no obvious explanation for how a peptide with low MHC class I binding also elicits a low avidity T cell response.

This was important to demonstrate because other studies, using tumor models, have shown that immunogenicity and tumor recognition are not necessarily concordant [39]. Mutations resulting in CTL escape occur most commonly in determinants that are exposed to high selective pressure [40]\u2013[42] and outgrowth of CTL escape variants is efficiently suppressed by effective and rapid virus clearance [43]\u2013[46], as occurs in mice infected with rJ.SQ600Y. Thus, even though CTL escape is not detected in normal mice infected with LCMV or influenza, escape does occur when mice transgenic for a single LCMV-specific TcR are infected with high amounts of virus [44],[47]. Under these conditions, the immune response is highly focused on a single CD8 T cell determinant and virus replication continues for extended periods of time, facilitating mutation at the targeted determinant.",

Mutations in S598Q600Y were not detected even when the CTL response was directed primarily at this determinant (e.g. mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y). Consistent with this inability to readily tolerate mutations, we were unable to generate recombinant virus mutated in position Ile-4 (I601D,E,K,R,T) and recombinant virus mutated at Phe-5 (F602A) was highly attenuated (data not shown). The combination of induction of high avidity CTL and inability to tolerate mutation without adversely affecting virus fitness make S598Q600Y an ideal target for the anti-JHMV CTL response. Further, the ala scanning results suggest that S598Q600Y-specific CTLs may more readily tolerate changes in the H-2Kb/peptide complex, and this plasticity would also minimize the likelihood of CTL escape. In contrast, we have previously shown that introduction of the LCMV-specific GP33 determinant, which also elicits CTL with high functional avidity, into JHMV greatly diminished clinical disease but did not prevent CTL escape [22]. The GP33 determinant was introduced at a site in the genome that tolerated mutation and deletion and intact determinant was no longer present in virus by day 20 p.i. Collectively these results suggest that a response to a second determinant that elicits CTL exhibiting high functional avidity at early times p.i. results in enhanced suppression of virus replication, but its presence throughout the infection is required to protect against CTL escape.",

In our mouse system, immunization with the heteroclitic determinant resulted in the generation of unique populations of CTL that respond with high functional avidity to an otherwise modestly immunogenic viral epitope. The generation of unique populations of CTL that respond with high functional avidity to weakly immunogenic epitopes will be useful for the treatment and prevention of human infectious diseases. Our proposed structure-guided approach has direct application to HIV, HCV and other chronic infections in which virus persistence and CTL escape occurs. By modulating T cell immunity through prophylactic or therapeutic peptide-based vaccination, virus titers may be reduced and CTL escape and other consequences of viral persistence circumvented.",

Suckling mice were infected at 10 days of age and nursed on dams that had been previously immunized with virulent JHMV. To control for the delivery of protective maternal antibody, one-half of each litter was infected with rJ while the other half was infected with rJ.SQ600Y. Data represent results from 10 litters derived from multiple independent JHMV-immune dams. Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of pups infected with each virus.
