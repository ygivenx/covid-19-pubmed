            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative strand RNA virus belonging to the family Pneumoviridae. RSV is a major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in the pediatric population and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of severe respiratory disease in the elderly [1\u20133]. Despite the major clinical impact of RSV on human health worldwide, no approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy is available. Although RSV infections do evoke humoral and cellular immune responses required to clear infection, these responses do not provide strong protection against a subsequent infection with RSV. Early during infection, viral replication is sensed by the host\u2019s innate immune system, which leads to the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs), which is followed by the induction of an array of genes that code for antiviral proteins. In addition, IFN will recruit and activate innate leukocytes, including antiviral monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and stimulate the adaptive immune response [4]. RSV has evolved a marvelous set of mechanisms to subvert this canonical antiviral response of the mammalian host, most notably by virtue of its nonstructural (NS) 1 and NS2 proteins.",

            "text": "The innate immune system is an important early line of defense against pathogens. This system comprises pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Activated PRRs can induce the expression of cytokines, e.g., type I and III IFNs, which mount an antiviral state in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. Upon RSV infection, airway epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) are the main inducers of innate immune responses. Several Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been identified that can act as PRRs for RSV-derived PAMPs (Fig 1). TLR2, -3, and -6, for example, have been implicated in the induction of cytokines and chemokines upon RSV infection [5, 6]. A role for TLR4, which is well known to respond to lipopolysaccharide, as a PRR for RSV is currently debated. Although some groups reported an impaired innate immune response in TLR4-deficient mice [7\u20139], Ehl and colleagues could not confirm a role for a TLR4-mediated immune response upon RSV infection [10]. In addition, TLR7 might even play a role in tempering immune responses upon RSV infection [11]. Moreover, type I IFN production by macrophages and DCs from wild-type and TLR1, -2, -4, -6, and -7 knockout mice is very similar following RSV infection [5, 11]. Finally, alveolar macrophages are the primary source of type I IFN in RSV-infected mice, and TLRs do not play a crucial role in this response [4, 12].",

Type I IFN expression is strongly hampered in the absence of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the adaptor protein for RIG-I and melanoma differentiation\u2013associated protein 5 (MDA5) [12, 13]. Early on, gene expression ablation studies revealed that RIG-I is the most important RLR to detect RSV, which is supported by the observation that RSV mRNA could be coimmunoprecipitated with RIG-I but not with MDA5 [14\u201317]. Later, however, both RIG-I and MDA5 were found to colocalize with RSV genomic RNA and the N protein [18]. Interestingly, whereas RIG-I partially localizes to RSV-induced inclusion bodies, MDA5 and MAVS were found nearly exclusively in these inclusion bodies, thereby dramatically blunting IFN-\u03b2 induction.",

            "text": "A widespread strategy of viruses to dampen innate immune responses is to counteract one of the early signaling steps in RLR-mediated IFN induction, i.e., the interaction of RIG-I or MDA5 with MAVS [42\u201345]. Likewise, RSV prevents the interaction of RIG-I with its adaptor MAVS. In RSV-infected HEp-2 cells and A549 cells overexpressing NS1, NS1 was shown to interact with MAVS (Fig 2) [46]. By binding to MAVS, NS1 could dose-dependently prevent the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS in A549 cells. Furthermore, Ban and colleagues demonstrated that ectopically expressed NS1 in HEK293T cells interacts with the PRY-SPRY domain of E3 ubiquitin/IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) ligase tripartite motif\u2013containing protein 25 (TRIM25). This domain is responsible for the interaction of TRIM25 with RIG-I [47]. NS1 binding to the PRY-SPRY domain suppresses K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I by TRIM25, which is essential for its downstream interaction with MAVS (Fig 2). Proteins of 2 other respiratory viruses also target the PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM25, which highlights the evolutionary importance of TRIM25 in mammalian antiviral defense. By binding the PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM25, the NS1 protein of influenza A virus and the nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus also counteract TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination [48, 49]. NS2 can interact with the N-terminal domain of RIG-I, both upon overexpression in HEK293T cells and during RSV infection in A549 cells (Fig 2) [50]. As such, overexpressed NS2 disrupts the binding of RIG-I with MAVS; however, this has not yet been confirmed for endogenous NS2 expressed during an RSV infection. In addition to counteracting the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS, NS1 may also influence RIG-I expression, although the reported findings seem conflicting. RIG-I expression in A549 cells is strongly reduced in the presence of RSV NS1, either expressed separately or in the context of an RSV infection [51]. Boyapalle and colleagues, however, reported that RIG-I expression in A549 cells is reduced following infection with an NS1-deficient RSV [46]. This is surprising, because RIG-I is itself an ISG. Possibly, this discrepancy is caused by the different multiplicity of infection (MOI) used by these 2 groups (MOI 3 and 1, respectively). In contrast to RIG-I, MAVS appears to be resistant to NS1- and/or NS2-mediated down-regulation [51]. All together, these results highlight that the interaction of RIG-I with MAVS is suppressed by both NS1 and NS2 and that RIG-I expression itself might be reduced by NS1. Currently, it is not clear whether NS1 and/or NS2 can disturb the interaction of MDA5 or NOD2 with MAVS and whether they impact MDA5 or NOD2 expression levels.",

            "text": "Association of RLRs with MAVS leads to the recruitment of the adaptors tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and -6 (TRAF6). Whereas TRAF3 activates the downstream serine/threonine kinases inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKK\u03b5) and tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1), TRAF6 activates the downstream kinases IKK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) (Fig 1). The effect of NS1 and NS2 on TRAF3, IKK\u03b5, and TBK1 is currently inconclusive. Some groups reported that NS1, either overexpressed or expressed during an RSV infection in A549 cells, reduces the expression levels of both TRAF3 and IKK\u03b5 (Fig 2) [51, 52]. Ren and colleagues, however, observed no difference in endogenous and recombinant TRAF3 and IKK\u03b5 expression in A549 cells in the presence or absence of NS1 [39]. Possibly, the different strains (RSV long versus A2) or experimental timing used explain these opposing observations. Overexpression of NS2 in A549 cells modestly reduces and slightly enhances TRAF3 and IKK\u03b5 expression levels, respectively (Fig 2) [51, 52]. These effects of NS2 were, however, not observed with an RSV strain that lacks NS1. Ling and colleagues also observed that overexpressed NS2 enhances overexpression of IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 in HEK293T cells (Fig 2) [50]. To our knowledge, no data have been published on the possible effect of NS1 on the expression of TBK1. Coexpression of NS1 and NS2 in A549 cells reduces recombinant IKK\u03b5 expression, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of NS1 is dominant over the enhancing effect of NS2 [52]. These results suggest that NS1 suppresses TRAF3 and IKK\u03b5 expression, although more evidence is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Ectopic expression of NS2 slightly suppresses TRAF3 expression and enhances IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 expression, although these effects need to be confirmed during an RSV infection.",

Initial work with recombinant RSV strains lacking one or both NS proteins in A549 cells highlighted that NS1 and NS2 prevent nuclear translocation of IRF3, especially late (>9 hours post infection) in the RSV replication cycle [40, 50, 56]. This might, in part, be explained by the ability of NS1 to directly reduce the recombinant expression of IRF3 and IRF7 (Fig 2) [51]. In addition, by preventing the formation of the IRF3/CREB binding protein (CBP) complex in the nucleus, NS1 may also inhibit IRF3-dependent gene expression downstream of the nuclear translocation of IRF3 (Fig 2) [37, 39]. It is important to note that this NS1 effector function has only been demonstrated upon overexpression in HEK293T cells, so additional confirmation in an RSV infection is necessary.",

Several groups reported that the phosphorylation and total protein levels of Tyk2 are not altered by the expression of NS1 and/or NS2 [60\u201362]. Whether this also accounts for JAK1 is currently not clear. Infection of airway epithelial cell lines with human metapneumovirus, a respiratory virus closely related to RSV, does reduce both JAK1 and Tyk2 protein levels [63].",

            "text": "Additionally, JAK kinase activity is regulated by a negative feedback loop that consists of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, with SOCS1 and 3 being the strongest inhibitors of JAK kinases. It has been reported that NS1 and/or NS2 may regulate the expression of SOCS1 and/or SOCS3, thereby enhancing RSV replication [64\u201367]. Heterodimers of phosphorylated STAT1 and 2 transcription factors are important for the induction of ISGs. Consequently, numerous viral proteins counteract STAT1 and 2 proteins by using different strategies, e.g., by preventing STAT1/2 heterodimer formation (Nipah and Hendra virus nucleoprotein), by suppressing STAT1/2 nuclear translocation (Ebolavirus VP24), or by degrading STAT1 and/or 2 (Paramyxovirus V protein) [68\u201370]. Both STAT1 and 2 are targets for RSV. In human tracheobronchial epithelial cells and A549 cells, infection with RSV slightly increases total STAT1 protein levels, likely because STAT proteins are themselves ISG products [60\u201362, 71, 72]. STAT1 phosphorylation induced by exogenous type I IFN, however, is clearly reduced by NS2 but not by NS1 (Fig 2) [60\u201362, 73]. Whether NS2 also reduces STAT1 phosphorylation during an RSV infection has not been reported yet. In contrast to STAT1, both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated STAT2 protein levels are clearly reduced by RSV infection [60, 62, 73]. Whether NS1, NS2, or both reduce STAT2 levels is currently debated. Based on overexpression experiments and infections with RSV strains lacking NS1 and/or NS2, several groups reported that NS2, but not NS1, reduces STAT2 levels in vitro (Fig 2) [51, 52, 61, 62]. Others, however, also observed reduced STAT2 levels after overexpression of NS1 (Fig 2) [66, 73]. Lo and colleagues reported that recombinant coexpression of NS1 and NS2 reduces STAT2 levels stronger than NS2 alone, although expression of NS1 alone did not affect STAT2 levels [62]. In addition to reducing total STAT2 levels, RSV also seems to suppress nuclear translocation of the residual STAT2 proteins, an effect that depends on NS1 and/or NS2 [62]. So far, the possible impact of RSV NS proteins on STAT1 and 2 expression levels in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. Because mouse STAT2 appears resistant to NS2, primary human airway epithelial cell cultures or experiments in nonhuman primates may be required to confirm that NS2-mediated STAT2 reduction also occurs in vivo [62].",

Based on experiments with different transformed and primary cell cultures as well as mice, several groups concluded that RSV can inhibit the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) [82\u201388]. The exact mechanism that accounts for this inhibition, however, is debated. One group demonstrated that RSV blocks glucocorticoid-mediated GR activation in A549, BEAS-2B, and primary human small airway epithelial cells but not in the monocytic THP-1 cell line, suggesting that the effect is restricted to RSV-infected epithelial cells [83, 85]. Further mechanistic analysis in A549 cells suggested that NS1 and NS2 reduce the binding of the GR to GR-responsive promoters, without affecting GR total protein levels and nuclear translocation [83, 84, 86]. Interestingly, knockdown of MAVS in A549 cells lowered dexamethasone-induced transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-stimulated clone 22 (TSC22) domain family member 3 (also known as glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein [GILZ]) mRNA expression to a level similar to that of an RSV infection [86]. These results suggest that MAVS plays a role in glucocorticoid-induced GR activation in A549 cells and that NS1 and NS2 may indirectly suppress GR activation through inhibition of MAVS (see \u201cNS1 and NS2 interfere with RIG-I\u201d).",

A model was proposed in which viral infection is sensed by TLR3, which induces TGF-\u03b2 that subsequently activates the type I TGF-\u03b2 receptor activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5). ALK5 activation subsequently counteracts glucocorticoid activity through an unknown mechanism. In accordance with the aforementioned study, no difference in total GR\u03b1 protein levels or nuclear translocation were observed upon RSV infection. Interestingly, blocking ALK5 with the selective inhibitor SB431542 and reducing TGF-\u03b2 activity by tranilast (a compound used to manage a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory diseases) could subvert the RSV-mediated suppression of glucocorticoid activity. Although Xia and colleagues did not investigate the role of NS1 or NS2, NS1 may contribute to RSV-induced TGF-\u03b2 expression by up-regulating the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 6 (discussed in the next paragraph) [89].",

In RSV-infected A549 cells, NS1 suppresses miR-24 expression by up-regulating the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 6, which drives the expression of TGF-\u03b2 [89]. Remarkably, inhibition of miR-24 was shown to actually repress RSV replication in A549 cells [91]. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by the difference in time points after infection that were analyzed (1 day versus 3 days post infection). Possibly, NS1 suppresses the RSV-induced up-regulation of miR-24 within 24 hours post infection, whereas later on, miR-24 expression may be up-regulated to enhance viral replication. Investigating miR-24 expression levels beyond 24 hours post infection and the impact of NS1 on these levels may result in a better understanding of the role of miR-24 in RSV replication. In normal human bronchial epithelial cells, Let-7i and miR-30b expression is up-regulated during an RSV infection by a type I IFN and NF-\u03baB-dependent mechanism, respectively, and further increased in the absence of NS1 or NS2 [90]. This can be expected for let-7i, as the NS proteins suppress the type I IFN response. Moreover, the miR-30b promoter can be activated by the NF-\u03baB family member p65, which is activated during an RSV infection through a RIG-I/MAVS/TRAF6/IKK\u03b2 signaling pathway [16, 92]. By counteracting the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS (see \u201cNS1 and NS2 interfere with RIG-I\u201d), the NS proteins may dampen this pathway, leading to reduced activation of p65 and subsequent expression of miR-30b. To our knowledge, the effect of NS1 and/or NS2 on the RSV-induced activation of p65 has not been investigated yet. This could readily be tested by comparing total levels of activated p65 between cells infected with wild-type RSV and NS deletion strains. Whether the NS protein-mediated suppression of let7i and miR-30b favors or counteracts RSV replication is currently unclear.",

Munir and colleagues investigated the activation status of isolated human monocyte\u2013derived myeloid DCs upon RSV infection by quantifying several maturation markers, including cluster of differentiation (CD)38, 54, 80, 83, and 86 [41]. Infection with wild-type and NS-deficient RSV strains highlighted that NS1, and to a lesser extent NS2, suppress the maturation of human DCs. By using an IFNAR2-blocking antibody, this suppression was shown to partially depend on the capacity of the NS proteins to counteract the production of type I IFNs. Moreover, in vivo pulmonary conventional DC activation, as measured by the up-regulation of CD86 and CD80, was strongly hampered in RSV-infected mice that are deficient for MAVS, an essential signaling protein for RSV-induced type I IFN production [12]. Taken together, these results highlight that type I IFNs play a role in RSV-induced DC maturation. As such, the pleiotropic effector functions of NS1 and NS2 to counteract the production of type I IFNs likely account for the reduced DC maturation by NS1 and NS2.",

Deletion of NS1 was found to promote the proliferation and activation of CD103+ CD8+ T cells and T-helper 17 cells, 2 cell populations that can counteract RSV, and to suppress the activation of IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells. Remarkably, none of these effects on T cells appeared to depend on type I IFN. Possibly, IL-12\u03b2 and IL-23\u03b1 play a role as these cytokines were suppressed in DCs by NS1 in a type I IFN\u2013independent manner. In contrast, a study by Kotelkin and colleagues in mice identified that NS2, and not NS1, suppresses CD8+ T-cell responses in a type I IFN\u2013dependent manner [95]. Remarkably, although RSV-induced activation of DCs in MAVS-/- and MAVS-/-myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88 (MyD88)-/- mice was strongly impaired, these mice could still mount comparable CD8+ T-cell responses as wild-type mice [12]. This may in part be explained by the approximately 100-fold higher viral loads in MAVS-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. In addition, a small residual population of CD86-positive pulmonary DCs was still present in these mice that could migrate to the draining mediastinal lymph node to activate naive CD8+ T cells. As MAVS-/-MyD88-/- mice are still functional for toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter molecule 1 (TICAM1), the adaptor of TLR3, these DCs may have matured after the activation of TLR3 by RSV-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) [96].",

Goswami and colleagues hypothesized that NS1 and NS2 form a large (300 to 750 kDa) degradative complex, which they called the NS degradasome (NSD) [51]. In A549 cells, this complex could selectively degrade particular innate immune signaling proteins of which RIG-I was also confirmed as a substrate of NSD complexes isolated from RSV-infected cells. In this respect, it would be interesting to assess whether other reported NS target proteins are also substrates of the proposed NSD complexes in RSV-infected cells. The NSD complex appears to be metastable, and its activity is enhanced by mitochondria via MAVS, possibly through stabilizing the NSD complex [51]. Interestingly, in MAVS-deficient cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b1, wild-type RSV is almost equally attenuated as RSV lacking NS1 and NS2, confirming the importance of MAVS for NS protein-mediated suppression of type I IFN responses. In line with these results, NS2 mainly localizes to mitochondria and seems to recruit NS1 towards the mitochondria [58]. Furthermore, NS target proteins, but not other innate proteins, relocate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria upon expression of NS1 and NS2 [51]. All together, these results support the hypothesis of the formation of a mitochondrial-associated NSD complex to selectively degrade innate immune proteins in RSV-infected cells.",

            "text": "Although the exact composition of the NSD complex is still unresolved, the presence of the \u03b12 subunit from the 20S core proteasome sparked the idea that the NSD complex might act in a similar way as the host 26S proteasome [51]. In line with this hypothesis, NS protein\u2013induced STAT2 and OASL degradation is (partially) blocked by the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin [51, 60, 61, 73, 75]. In contrast, NS protein\u2013induced TRAF3 and IKK\u03b5 degradation appears insensitive to MG132 [52]. Proteasome-like activity of the NSD complex is further supported by the identification of NS1 and NS2 as potential inducers of host protein ubiquitination [73, 97]. Whereas NS1 is a putative Elongin B/C-Cullin 2/5-SOCS box-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, NS2 does not contain an Elongin C binding consensus sequence [73, 97, 98]. Interestingly, an RSV strain with 3 mutated NS2 residues that appear essential for ubiquitination activity and NS2-mediated STAT2 degradation is nearly equally attenuated as an NS2 deletion strain [97]. These results suggest that NS2 and NS1 may induce ubiquitination of host proteins, which are then degraded by the NSD complex. It is currently not known, however, if NS1 and/or NS2 selectively mark innate immune proteins for degradation, which would explain the selective degradative activity of the NSD complex. Recently, the crystal structure of NS1 was determined and revealed a remarkable structural homology with the N-terminal domain of the matrix protein of RSV [37]. One clear difference between NS1 and M is the presence of an \u03b1-helix (called \u03b13) at the C-terminus of NS1. A truncated NS1 lacking this helix or mutation of 3 residues that are important for the interaction of helix \u03b13 with the rest of NS1 partially abrogates NS1-mediated suppression of IFN-\u03b2 induction and attenuates recombinant RSV strains. These results confirm that helix \u03b13 is important for at least some NS1-mediated effector functions. Unravelling the crystal structure of NS2 and the composition of the NSD complex would greatly enhance our understanding of the remarkable diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2. Moreover, NS1 and/or NS2 may be attractive targets for antiviral therapy. Intranasal administration of nanoparticles carrying a plasmid encoding an NS1-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) in mice can reduce lung viral titers, airway hyperresponsiveness, and pulmonary inflammation, both in a prophylactic as well as therapeutic setting [99]. A recent small compound high-throughput screen revealed 4 candidate inhibitors of NS2, highlighting that NS2 could be targeted by a small compound drug [100].",

This is largely the consequence of 2 unique viral proteins, NS1 and NS2, that strongly suppress the induction and signaling of IFN. In recent years, evidence is rising that, in addition, antiviral activities of ISGs may be hampered by the NS proteins. NS1 and NS2 exert additional functions, such as delaying cell apoptosis, and loss of NS1 is associated with a stronger adaptive immune response and reduced in vivo viral replication. NS1 and NS2 are thought to form a so-called \u201cNS degradasome\u201d complex, which may function as a proteasome-like complex that selectively degrades a plethora of innate immune proteins. Further insight in the composition of the NSD and the resolution of the structure of NS2 will likely help to explain the remarkable diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2. Some effector functions, however, have so far only been identified in artificial cell systems and should be interpreted carefully. Large-scale protein\u2013protein interaction screens, preferentially performed using multiple complementary protein\u2013protein interaction techniques in the context of an RSV infection, will generate a more comprehensive list of host proteins that interact with NS1 and/or NS2. Such new knowledge, combined with co-crystal structure analysis of RSV NS1 and NS2 in complex with host protein factors, will be instrumental to design antiviral drugs that impact on the RSV\u2013host interface and thereby complement directly acting antivirals.",

Firstly, TLR-2, -3, -4, -6, and -7 (marked in green) are involved in the production of cytokines and chemokines upon RSV infection. Secondly, RIG-I and possibly MDA5 (RLRs, marked in red), are important in the induction of type I IFNs. Thirdly, NOD2 (marked in dark blue) also induces type I IFNs upon RSV infection. Currently, there is no evidence for a role of the CDSs (marked in purple), which signal through the ER-associated STING protein, as PRRs during RSV infection. Activation of the RLRs or NOD2 induces their association with the mitochondrial-associated MAVS, which recruits the adaptor proteins TRAF3 or TRAF6. Via the TRAF3 adaptor, the kinases IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 are subsequently activated, which phosphorylate and activate the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. Via the TRAF6 adaptor, 3 kinases are activated, i.e., the IKK kinase complex, JNK, and p38 MAPK, which phosphorylate and activate multiple transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, C-Jun, and ATF2, respectively. Activation of TLRs leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins, e.g., MyD88, TICAM1, TIRAP, and TRAM. These adaptors can signal via TRAF3 or TRAF6.

            "text": "Fig 2: Type I and III IFN responses are inhibited by NS1 and NS2 at multiple levels, both during the induction of type I and III IFNs (left panel) and during IFN-induced signaling (right panel). NS1 and NS2 can form a so-called \u201cNS degradasome\u201d complex that is stabilized by mitochondria via MAVS. The NSD complex is thought to contain HPs, including the proteasome \u03b12 subunit and other as yet unidentified proteins. NS1 and NS2 prevent the interaction of RIG-I with MAVS in different ways. NS1 binds to the PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM25, which is responsible for the interaction of TRIM25 with RIG-I. As such, NS1 prevents the TRIM25-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, which is necessary for the subsequent interaction of RIG-I with MAVS (1). Moreover, NS2 directly interacts with RIG-I (2) and NS1 interacts with MAVS (3) to suppress binding of RIG-I to MAVS. Whether the interaction of NS1 with MAVS also prevents the interaction of NOD2 with MAVS is currently unclear. NS1 reduces protein expression of TRAF3 and IKK\u03b5 (4), whereas NS2 modestly reduces TRAF3 and induces IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 (5). NS1 subsequently inhibits IRF3 and IRF7 by different proposed mechanisms (6). NS1 reduces IRF3 and IRF7 protein expression and prevents the interaction between IRF3 and CBP, thereby lowering the binding of the IRF3-CBP complex to the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. NS2, and to a lesser extent NS1, enhances the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB (7). These NS1/NS2 effector functions (1\u20137) synergistically reduce the production of type I and III IFNs. Furthermore, NS1 and NS2 also suppress type I and III IFN receptor-mediated signal transduction. NS1 induces miR-29a expression, which targets the mRNA coding for IFNAR1, one of the 2 subunits of the type I IFN receptor (8). NS1 and NS2 may induce expression of SOCS proteins (SOCS1 and 3), which negatively regulate the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2, which are important to transmit signaling from the type I and III IFN receptors (9). NS2 inhibits JAK1/TYK2-mediated activation of STAT1/2 by reducing STAT2 protein levels (10) and by reducing STAT1 phosphorylation (11). Some groups, however, reported that STAT2 expression can also be reduced by NS1 (see text) (10). NS1 and NS2 counteract the anti-inflammatory activity of the GR, although the exact mechanism is debated. In one model, NS1 interacts with the nuclear translocator IPO13, which competes with GR for its nuclear translocation (12). Recent evidence suggests that the NS proteins may also counteract antiviral effector functions of ISGs, e.g., NS1 degrades the OASL, IFIT1, and IFITM3 proteins, whereas NS2 degrades MAPK8 (13).
