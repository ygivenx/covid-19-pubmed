This infection is often fatal to kittens, but adult cats usually survive and exhibit lifelong latency [2,3]. Since the first strain of FHV-1 was isolated in America, infected felids have been reported in many countries, including Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Holland, Hungary and Japan [4]. There have been no documented reports on FHV-1 in the past few years, although the distribution in China was confirmed by serological survey and virus isolation in domestic cats [5].",

The FHV-1 described in this study, was isolated from a captive tiger that exhibited respiratory signs that were suspected to be due to rhinotracheitis. By PCR/RT-PCR, the only virus detected in the trachea homogenates was FHV-1, which was confirmed afterwards by virus isolation, the TEM examination of cell cultures showing CPE, and a challenge experiment in cats. Furthermore, the full genome of the virus isolated in cell culture is being sequenced, and the obtained sequences are 90%\u2013100% homologous with that of PCR products either for TK gene or for gB gene. Challenged cats exhibited uniform clinical symptoms and shed FHV-1 virus. Other agents causing respiratory disease were excluded as possible pathogens.",

On its infection, the authors supposed two possible sources. One was that the tiger got the virus in captivity perhaps due to stray cats in the zoo, because FHV-1 was shed in ocular, nasal, and oral secretions, and transmission was primarily by direct contact with an infected cat. The other was an endogenous infection originating from a latent viral infection. As with other alphaherpesviruses, latency is common, and periodic viral reactivation is sometimes associated with the reoccurrence of clinical signs [17]. To validate the first supposition, a retrospective investigation was conducted after the virus isolation and identification. Although negative PCR results were found for the swab samples collected from stray cats and captive leopards and tigers, the contagious source could not be easily obviated. It is very much regrettable that neither prior sera nor post mortem sera were stored enabling the seroconversion analysis, making our second supposition to be theoretic.",
