Seasonal epidemics are instigated by the quick spread of influenza virus variants generated by antigenic drift, a process that facilitates the escape of the virus from the host immune system from one outbreak to another. As a result, influenza vaccines need to be reformulated before each annual epidemic, and while yearly immunization has been the most efficient way to prevent influenza so far, vaccines do not provide complete protection [5].",

In April 2009, a new strain of influenza A (2009 pandemic H1N1) genetically related to swine influenza viruses but capable of efficient human-to-human transmission emerged in Mexico and California and caused the first influenza pandemic since 1968 [6], [7]. While the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus does not generally cause a more severe illness than the seasonal strains, it can trigger acute pulmonary symptoms due to its ability to infect cells of the lower respiratory tract [8]. Importantly, reassortment between the seasonal strains and the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus could lead to the emergence of variants with increased pathogenicity and/or resistance to current antiviral treatments. Therefore, it is essential to further understand the mechanisms underlying the establishment and the maintenance of an effective immune response during influenza infection.",

            "text": "Recovery from acute influenza infection and resistance to re-infection rely both on the production of neutralizing antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase glycoproteins, and on the killing of infected cells by influenza-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes that mostly target conserved viral proteins [9], [10]. In addition, several studies have highlighted the early and pivotal role of innate effector cells, and particularly natural killer (NK) cells, in the control of influenza infection [11]\u2013[27]. Before the onset of the adaptive immune response, NK cells are not only responsible for the production of antiviral cytokines, but they are also directly involved in the rapid elimination of virally infected cells. Moreover, besides their direct antiviral activity, NK cells secrete large quantities of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines that directly modulate the quality of the adaptive immune response, mainly via their interaction with dendritic cells [28]. NK cells initially represent a substantial portion of the lymphocyte population that resides in the healthy lungs and are further recruited to the respiratory tract within days of influenza infection [16], [25], [29], [30]. Furthermore, several studies in mice have illustrated that NK cell depletion leads to augmented morbidity and mortality from infection [26], [27], [31] and that impaired activity of NK cells early in the infection results in a delayed clearance of the virus from the lungs [21], [32]. Finally, in humans, severe and/or lethal influenza infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus has been associated with reduced proportions of NK cells in the peripheral blood and the lungs [13], yet very little is known about changes in the phenotype and function of NK cells in acute 2009 H1N1 influenza infection.",

We show that acute influenza infection is associated with a depletion of peripheral blood NK cells, and particularly CD56bright NK cells, consistent with their homing to infected tissues and/or with an increased NK cell death. Influenza vaccination and infection both lead to NK cell activation, with the highest levels found in acute influenza with human viruses. Finally, we describe significant changes in cytokine concentrations in the plasma of infected subjects, and notably a marked increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines. These studies provide insights into innate immune responses following influenza antigens exposure in humans.",

We first examined NK cell numbers in blood samples from study subjects with acute influenza caused by either seasonal or 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses, or following seasonal intramuscular influenza vaccination. Absolute numbers of NK cells were decreased in patients infected with seasonal (p = 0.04) and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (p = 0.0005) influenza viruses compared to healthy unvaccinated individuals (Fig. 1A), whereas percentages of NK cells relative to the total lymphocyte population were slightly increased in influenza infected patients, notably in seasonal influenza infection (p = 0.04) (Fig. 1B). Of note, diminished NK cell numbers reflected a general lymphopenia in the majority of influenza infected subjects (data not shown).",

Altogether, these data suggest that peripheral blood lymphocytes, including NK cells, home to infected tissues early in acute infection with both seasonal and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza strains, and that this recruitment might specifically involve CD56bright NK cells. On the other hand, exposure to the inactivated virus through intramuscular route resulted in an initial drop ultimately leading to increased amounts of peripheral blood NK cells, which might be explained by NK cell proliferation and/or recruitment from the tissues.",

Plasma concentrations of IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and GM-CSF tended to be lower in patients infected with seasonal and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses than in healthy individuals, yet a significant decrease was only observed for MIP-1\u03b2 in subjects with pandemic H1N1 influenza infection (p = 0.03) (Fig. 5). In contrast, we found markedly increased levels of cytokines with anti-inflammatory properties including IL-10 (p = 0.005 and 0.002) and IL-1Ra (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003) in influenza-infected patients. Regarding cytokines involved in NK cell activation, plasma levels of IL-2 decreased in infected patients, notably in seasonal influenza infection (p = 0.04), while the concentration of IL-15 was slightly higher in acute influenza, and particularly in subjects with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza infection (p = 0.04). Acute influenza was also associated with an overall three-fold increase in plasma IFN-\u03b12 (not significant). Importantly, there were no remarkable differences in cytokine concentrations between patients infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and those infected with seasonal influenza strains. Cytokines concentrations were very low and stable over time in the plasma of vaccinated subjects (data not shown). In summary, low levels of cytokines produced by NK cells, among other cell types, and significantly increased amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the blood of subjects with acute influenza infection.",

Influenza infection and vaccination both affected NK cell counts, the former leading to decreased and the latter to increased numbers of peripheral NK cells, with the most significant changes affecting CD56bright NK cells expressing the marker of immune activation CD25. Exposure to influenza antigens was associated with increased percentages of CD69+ NK cells, notably in the peripheral blood of patients infected with seasonal strains, consistent with a virus-dependent state of NK cell immune activation and a more potent cytotoxic function against target cell lines than NK cells from healthy subjects.

Acute influenza infection was associated with increased percentages of CD69+ and decreased absolute numbers of CD25+ NK cells, suggesting that CD25+ NK cells, and therefore activated CD56brightNK cells, might be recruited to the site of infection and/or might undergo increased apoptosis rates, while CD69 is a less specific marker of activation that is upregulated on all NK cells subsets. Increased CD69 expression conferred a higher NK cell-mediated cytotoxic function against K562 or 221 cell lines yet a diminished degranulatory activity in response to a secondary stimulation with H1N1, supporting the hypothesis that NK cells that can efficiently respond to influenza have been recruited to infected tissues and are not circulating in the periphery any more. Alternatively, NK cells might have become anergic to further restimulation. For instance, exposure to influenza antigens leads to the downregulation of NKp46, an activating NK cell receptor that can recognize influenza hemagglutinin, an observation that might explain the decreased NK cell response to influenza re-stimulation [47].",

            "text": "Our results support a role for NK cells, and particularly for CD56bright NK cells, in the response to influenza. As the CD56bright NK cell subset is endowed with immunoregulatory properties, and the pathogenicity of virulent influenza strains has been associated with altered innate responses and hypercytokinemia [48]\u2013[50], we quantified the levels of various cytokines in the plasma of infected and vaccinated subjects. Decreased concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3, of the growth factor GM-CSF and of the chemokines MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 were observed in infected individuals compared to healthy subjects, possibly reflecting an uptake of these cytokines by other immune cells. Alternatively, these cytokines might be secreted locally in other tissues than blood by cells that have been recruited to the site of infection. However, it is very likely that massive local production of cytokines would lead to spillover into the systemic circulation. Elevated plasma levels of IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 in patients with severe influenza were recently reported [51]. Our study subjects were enrolled through the Massachusetts General Hospital emergency room and therefore presented symptoms, yet the fact that they had a moderate rather than a severe disease might explain the discrepancy between our results and those published by Heltzer et al. Also, samples from acutely infected individuals might have been collected too late after infection to identify IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 in the plasma. IL-6 plasma levels were not examined in our study. Nevertheless, timing issues could not explain the suppression of cytokines observed in our influenza-infected subjects. In addition, elevated concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines have been detected in the acute symptomatic phase of many viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus and severe influenza virus infections [48], [52]\u2013[54]. One hypothesis is that low NK cell numbers due to significant NK cell death might account for the decreased NK cell production of cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, GM-CSF, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2, detected in our patients. Surely, further experiments are warranted to understand the mechanisms underlying the low pro-inflammatory cytokine levels observed in our patients. Nonetheless, in accordance with previously published studies, we report increased levels of IFN-\u03b12 in the plasma of influenza-inoculated subjects [55], yet this cytokine is more likely to derive from plasmacytoid dendritic cells than from NK cells. Changes in IL-2 and IL-15 levels are consistent with a key role for these cytokines in the NK cell response to influenza infection as we and others have reported that IL-2 is required to enhance IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells, while IL-15 promotes NK cell proliferation in response to influenza (data not shown and [56]).",

While IL-1ra treatment has been shown to increase the survival rate of influenza-infected mice [57], the impact of IL-10 on the outcome of influenza infection in mouse models is still controversial [58]\u2013[60]. Further investigations to better characterize the role played by these cytokines in seasonal influenza infection, and notably to identify IL-10- and IL-1ra-secreting immune cell subsets, are warranted, as other regulatory responses, such as T cell responses, probably contribute to the observed immune suppressive profile.",

The LIVE/DEAD\u00ae Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit was used prior surface staining to exclude dead cells. NK cell function was quantified after stimulation of fresh PBMCs either with major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)\u2013devoid K562 and 221 cell lines (ATCC) at an effector-to-target cell ratio of 10\u22361 as previously described [61] or with the A/PR/8/34 H1N1 influenza virus (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA). Influenza infection was performed by adding the virus at an MOI of 5.2 to 106 cells resuspended in 0.1 ml of RPMI-1640 medium without serum. After one hour of incubation at 37 C with 5% CO2, RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin was added to a final volume of 1 ml. 7 \u00b5L/ml CD107a-PE-Cy5 antibody (BD Biosciences) and monensin (GolgiStop; BD Biosciences) at a final concentrations of 0.9 nM were added immediately to all reaction tubes and the total stimulation lasted for 4 (cell lines) or 16 (influenza) hours. Unstimulated PBMCs were similarly treated in parallel to define the background level of degranulation and PMA/ionomycin (2.5 and 0.5 ug/ml, respectively) served as the positive control. Fixed cells were analyzed on an LSRII system using FacsDiva version 8.8.3 (BD Biosciences). The frequency and phenotypes of NK cells were defined using FlowJo version 7.5.5 (Treestar).",
