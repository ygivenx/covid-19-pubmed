Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have received extensive attention for the considerable economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Great advances have been made in elucidation of the molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PED [2]. Recently, coronavirus interaction with host innate immune system has been a hot research field. Previous studies indicated that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection enhanced type I interferon expression and its protein 7 modulated type I IFN expression [3, 4]. For mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), IFN production among different cell populations varied due to their diverse susceptibility to this virus [5\u20139]. Furthermore, both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) do not induce type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) activation [10\u201312]. So far, limited reports showed that PEDV could inhibit type I interferon production [13, 14].",

IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is an essential element of the host innate immune response against viral infections. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the replicative intermediate of most viruses, is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b2, which is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Two of major PRRs, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) detect dsRNA in the cytoplasm [15]. Following dsRNA binding, RIG-I and MDA5 recruit corresponding adapter protein IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) that, in turn, activate downstream signaling of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of \u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) transduction, leading to the activation of transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB). Activated IRF-3, and NF-\u03baB bind to IFN-\u03b2 enhancer and initiate IFN-\u03b2 transcription [16].",

However, it was often considered that Vero cells might lack genetic component necessary for IFN production [18\u201320]. Porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are thought to the target cells of PEDV, which play an important role in the activation of host immune responses by induction of key signaling molecules, including cytokines, surface molecules, and chemokines during microoganism invasion [21, 22]. In the present study, to determine if PEDV infection suppresses IFN-\u03b2 activation, we chose IECs as an infection model to research the molecular mechanisms of PEDV infection and the host antiviral innate immune response. Our results clearly suggested that PEDV prevented dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 synthesis by blocking RIG-I-mediated pathways.",

However, there is no evidence suggesting that IECs produce type I IFNs in response to PEDV infection. Previous studies have showed that PEDV could be propagated in IECs [ 23, 24,]. To confirm whether PEDV infection could induce IFN-\u03b2 production in IECs or not, we transiently cotransfected the IFN-\u03b2/luciferase reporter plasmid (IFN-\u03b2-Luc) and the Renilla luciferase construct phRL-TK and then infected with PEDV (at an MOI of 1 or 0.1, respectively) or mock-infected for 24 h. The cells were retransfected with 1 \u03bcg of poly (I:C) as a positive inducer. As shown in Fig. 1a, IFN-\u03b2 luciferase activity enhanced markedly in positive controls, while it was almost not detected in PEDV-infected IECs. In addition, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression was hardly detected in PEDV-infected IECs similar to mock-infected group, however, it had significant expression in poly (I:C)-transfected group at the indicated times (12 h and 24 h, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1b). This result was consistent with the luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, PEDV infection of IECs did not induce IFN-\u03b2 activation.",

Phosphorylation, which is a key step during IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB activation, in turn, leads to nuclear translocation. Therefore, we evaluated whether PEDV infection induced IRF-3 and p65 activation by western blot analysis. Following PEDV infection, the whole cell extracts were prepared for the indicative times, in Fig. 2a, IRF-3 still existed in the cytoplasm, and the levels of IRF-3 protein was almost equal with mock-infected cells, while the phosphorylation of IRF-3 (p-IRF-3) did not detect in the PEDV infected cells in comparision to a obviously signal in poly (I:C)-transfected cells. On the contrary, compared with the amount of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 in the cytoplasm, the phosphorylation of p65 (p-p65) increased with progression of PEDV infection in the nucleus. Meanwhile, the concentration of poly (I:C)-induced p65 nuclear translocation was clearly increased. PEDV N protein was also detected in PEDV-infected cells. These data suggested that PEDV did not induce activation of IRF-3, but NF-\u03baB.",

In addition, we found that poly (I:C)-induced activation of NF-\u03baB was not blocked by PEDV. To further identify PEDV-inhibited poly (I:C)-mediated activation of IRF-3, confocal microscopy assay was used. As a result, IRF3-GFP remained in the cytoplasm of both mock-infected (Fig. 2d. a) and PEDV-infected (Fig. 2d. b) IECs compared with poly (I:C) controls, in which clear translocation to the nucleus was observed (Fig. 2d. d). Furthermore, PEDV could block poly (I:C)-mediated IRF-3 nucleus migration (Fig. 2d. c).

The target interaction molecules of PEDV intervention of dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 production primarily was IPS-1. However, as a limitation to this study, host cells may inhibit or activate multiple signaling pathways simultaneously in response to exogenous stimulus, and some other transcription factors may have been blocked or activated in this process. Here, we only addressed the mechanisms of PEDV-induced inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production in relation to the molecules of RIG-I signaling pathways in vitro. Further studies are needed. Overall, elucidation of the influence of PEDV evasion of the host innate immune response will aid in the development of antiviral agents to prevent the spread of PEDV during the early infection phase.",
