The first coronavirus (CoV) was discovered during the 1930s [1], and the first human coronavirus was characterized in the 1960s [2]. Since then, five novel human coronaviruses have been discovered. The coronavirus family gained particular notoriety with the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2013. In humans, coronaviruses are associated with respiratory disease, causing a range of symptoms from mild common colds to more severe lower respiratory tract infections that can be lethal. CoV infection in a range of non-human mammals and birds is associated with enteric and respiratory diseases as well as hepatitis and neurological disorders [3].",

Interestingly, all the rodent \u03b1-CoVs possessed a \u03b2-CoV-like spike, which indicates recombination between \u03b1 and \u03b2-CoV. All the rodent \u03b1-CoVs possessed a predicted 214 aa long ORF3 gene located between the S and the E gene. The closest match for ORF3 was the 3c-like protein of ferret alphacoronavirus with 47% similarity at the amino acid level. Another striking feature of rodent alphacoronavirus genomes was the presence of the predicted ORF6 (165 aa) gene between the M and N genes, which is observed in no other members of the genus Alphacoronavirus. Other common features of all the rodent \u03b1-CoV were the presence of a predicted ORF8 (~181 aa) within the N gene and ORF9 (~111 aa) downstream of the N gene.

The tanglegram was generated by linking the phylogenies of rodent alpha-CoV ORF1b to their equivalent rodent species and assessing whether there were changes in the branching order in the two phylogenies, which would indicate cross-species transmission. The rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus; order Lagomorpha) sequence was used as outgroup as it has previously been shown to be closely related to the Rodentia order [5]. Notably, the topology of the cytochrome b tree did not fully match that observed for the rodent alpha-CoVs, in which PLMg1 (Myodes spp.) fell basal to all the other viruses, and RtMruf and RCoV/RMU10 3212/Myo gla/GER/2010 (Myodes spp.) were more closely related to Rattus spp. coronaviruses (UKRn3, Lucheng Rn, RtRl).

Under the most likely co-phylogenetic scenario, virus-host co-divergence explained 22% of all evolutionary events, with host-switching (i.e., cross-species transmission) more frequent at 45% (and duplications accounting for 33%), although the relative frequency of these events is likely to change with more extensive sampling.

Although it was mentioned that no TRS was detected for ORF3 in Lucheng Rn CoV [17], we used the core TRS of AcCoV-JC34 (5\u2032-UACUAAA-3\u2032) [10] for ORF3 as a reference, and we were able to find the same sequence in Lucheng Rn CoV, UKRn3, and RtMruf. Other variations such as 5\u2032-CACUAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GACUAA-3\u2032 were observed in ORF8 of UKMa1 and RtMruf, respectively. The variation 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032 has been observed in Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [25,26]. The conserved core TRS among rodent alpha-CoVs is another indicator that they originate from a common ancestor.",

It then spread from Southeast Asia to the Middle East ~3100 years ago, then to Africa ~2000 years ago, and finally to Europe ~1800 years ago [28]. Therefore, it is possible that even though the European UKRn3 coronavirus appears to be approximately as old as Lucheng Rn CoV, the global spread of the brown rat implies that the virus introduction into Europe occurred with that host and was a relatively recent event.",
