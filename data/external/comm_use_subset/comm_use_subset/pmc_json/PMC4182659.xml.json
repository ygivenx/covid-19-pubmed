            "text": "Influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family and are classified into three antigenic types, A, B and C. They have a negative-polarity RNA genome segmented into eight (type A and B) or seven (type C) single-stranded molecules. Type C virus has a unique envelope glycoprotein (HEF) whereas type A and B viruses have two (HA and NA) [1]. Each genomic viral RNA (vRNA) is encapsidated by multiple nucleoproteins (NP) and associated with the polymerase complex (P) formed by three subunits named PB1, PB2 and PA for influenza A viruses and PB1, PB2 and P3 for influenza C viruses. In the nucleus of infected cells, the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are products of a transcription process involving a cap-snatching mechanism: the mRNA synthesis is initiated with capped RNA primers that are cleaved from host cell mRNAs. Transcription into mRNA terminates 17 to 22 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the 5\u2032 end of the genomic vRNA template at a stretch of five to seven uridine residues used as polyadenylation signal. The syntheses of the complementary RNAs (cRNAs) and of the vRNAs are primer-independent. Anti-termination occurs at the poly U sequence during the cRNA synthesis which, itself, is used as a template for the synthesis of the genomic vRNAs [1].",

The total length of the NC sequences of each segment of influenza A and C viruses is very variable and depends on the non conserved sequence length [6]. This is particularly true for the NP segment, for which the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC sequences are 45 and 23 nt long for type A and 29 and 102 nt long for type C influenza viruses, respectively (all numbers excluding the ATG and stop codons).",

Based on potential base-pairing, two elements were defined within the NC ends: the proximal element or region I (nt 1\u20139 of 3\u2032 end and 1\u201310 of 5\u2032 end) and the distal element or region II involving sequences downstream of nt 10 and 11 from the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends respectively [7]. Two possible secondary structures formed by the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of each segment have been described: the \u2018panhandle structure\u2019 resulting from the base-pairing of the respective proximal and distal elements of each ends [8], [9], [10]; and the \u2018corkscrew structure\u2019 that consists of hairpin loops formed by the respective proximal elements followed by base-pairing of the distal elements [11], [12], [13], [14]. These structures are known to be critical for the virus multiplication, in particular for the transcription and the replication of the vRNAs [7]. The distal element can in fact be further divided into two sub-elements: the initial distal panhandle corresponding to the first nine nucleotides (for illustration, see A1 and C1 in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively) and the remaining distal element.",

Only the virus with type A 3\u2032 end was rescued (A8), but with a dramatically lower efficiency. Type C 5\u2032end is much longer than that of type A (102 nt vs 23 nt) [6]. To test whether this might affect the recovery efficiency, deletions were introduced in both A7 and A8 constructs to generate A9 and A10, respectively (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, A9 could not be rescued. The A10 virus was rescued with the same efficiency as wt. This was not surprising, since A1 and A10 differed by only two nucleotides. The role of the initial distal panhandle strength was further verified by modifying A10 to generate constructs A11 and A12 (energy barrier 11.38, 8.03 and 11.38, Fig. 1). No virus was rescued when the strength of the initial distal panhandle was reverted to that of A6 while maintaining the short 5\u2032 end (construct A11). On the contrary, modification of the sequence of the initial distal panhandle while maintaining the strength (A12) led to efficient rescue. These data based on type A influenza virus NP segment showed that it is possible to obtain virus by reverse genetics when a homotypic proximal panhandle and a homotypic strength of the initial distal panhandle are maintained, and that the length of the 5\u2032 end plays an important role in the efficiency of rescue.",

            "text": "The fact that no virus was rescued for construct A9 pointed out the potential role of the 3\u2032end in type specificity. Construct A13 differed from its parental construct A9 by an extension of the 16 nucleotides that precede the start codon in type A 3\u2032end in order to match the length of type A 3\u2032 end (Fig. 1). No virus was rescued and we supposed that there might be some important specific nucleotides in the type A 3\u2032 end. To test this hypothesis, we generated constructs A14 to A17 (Fig. 1), where point mutations were introduced in the wt A1 to replace specific nucleotides by those found in type C 3\u2032 end. The efficiency of rescue was only affected for A16, for which the strand interaction strength around the stop codon was modified (energy barrier 3.99 for A16 vs \u22120.7 for A1), resembling that of A9 and A13. However, all A14\u2013A17 viruses were rescued and this could not, on its own, explain the impossibility to recover A9 and A13. Type C NP segment was demonstrated to be efficiently transcribed and replicated by type A polymerase in an artificial system based on CAT expression [6]. Although only the proximal and initial distal panhandles were described as required to initiate transcription and replication [23], minireplicon assays using the same plasmids used for reverse genetics to generate vRNA templates showed that transcription and replication levels were only slightly affected for A16 (Fig. 3B) and A13 constructs (data not shown), but were largely impaired for A9 construct (reduced by about a 100 fold compared to wt A1 construct). We speculate that impaired transcription/replication processes of the NP segment might not be the main obstacle to reverse genetics recovery and that, somehow, packaging of the NP segment could be prevented for A9 and A13. Influenza virus non conserved non coding regions are known to carry packaging signals [24],[25] and to be involved in intermolecular vRNA-vRNA interactions [26]. The influence of the sequences surrounding the stop codon thus needs to be further investigated, as several positions differ between A13 and A16.",

Only C3 virus, with the remaining distal parts of type C 5\u2032end and of type A 3\u2032 end, was successfully and efficiently rescued. To confirm that the length of the 3\u2032 end was not essential to rescue type C viruses, a deletion of 16 nt in the 3\u2032 end of C3 was performed to generate the C5 construct, which was recovered as efficiently as C3 (Fig. 2).

On the contrary to type A virus, for which it was observed that increasing the length of the 5\u2032 end (from 23 nt to 102 nt) impaired the recovery efficiency, one could expect that, for type C virus, the efficiency would be affected by shortening the 5\u2032 end. A reduction of 22 or 41 nt (leading to 80 and 61 nt long 5\u2032 ends, respectively) in C1 and C3 constructs had no effect on the recovery efficiency (constructs C7\u2013C8 and C10\u2013C11 for C1 and C3, respectively, Fig. 2). It was, however, affected when the 5\u2032 end length was reduced to 42 nt (constructs C9 and C12). These results confirmed the impact of the length of the NP segment 5\u2032 end on reverse genetics efficiency, as seen for type A virus. They are also in agreement with the variability in length that was observed for the two other sequenced strains of influenza type C viruses (C/California/78 and C/Ann Arbor/1/50), whose NP 5\u2032 ends are 80 nt long [6]. Finally, they could explain why C4 and C2 viruses were not rescued, since the length of their 5\u2032 end was identical to that of type A (23 nt long), so probably too short in a type C context. Extending the length in C4 5\u2032 end by 19 nucleotides to match that of C12 5\u2032 end allowed the recovery of recombinant virus by reverse genetics with a very low efficiency, but the virus could not be amplified from the reverse genetics supernatant (C13, Fig. 2).",

Western-blot was performed on cellular extracts collected at six hours post infection at an m.o.i. of 2 and NP/NS1 ratios were calculated (Fig. 4). The NP protein expression was clearly reduced for the virus with a long 5\u2032 end compared to wild type (NP/NS1 ratio of 0.8 vs 2.0 for A8 and A1, respectively). No difference was found for A10 virus compared to A1 (ratio of 2.0), indicating that the long 5\u2032 end is responsible for the lower expression of the NP protein for A8. The mRNA levels were relatively similar between the three viruses (mean Cp values = 19.97\u00b10.87, 19.47\u00b10.48, 20.65\u00b10.47 for A1, A10 and A8, respectively), suggesting that translation, rather than transcription, could be mainly affected. The 5\u2032 end of NP viral mRNA is entirely complementary to the 3\u2032 end of the genomic vRNA, but the viral mRNA 3\u2032 end includes only the complementary to the non conserved NC sequence up to the polyU signal in the genomic vRNA 5\u2032 end. Consequently, whereas the NP mRNA sequences are almost identical for A1 and A10 (with only a two nucleotide difference in the sequence between the stop codon and the polyA, and no difference in the NP protein expression levels), the NP mRNA of A8 is characterized by a longer 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). It was shown that the 3\u2032UTR of cellular mRNAs has a critical role in gene expression regulation [27]. The mRNA 3\u2032UTR could indeed regulate every steps of translation (initiation, elongation and termination) through different mechanisms involving RNA-binding proteins, micro-RNAs or the \u2018closed-loop\u2019 structure formed by the mRNA 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs via the eIF4 translation initiation factors [28], [29]. Several viral families were reported to regulate the translation of their own mRNAs by such mechanisms at either the initiation (Dengue virus [30], [31]; coxackievirus [32]), the elongation (Tobacco mosaic virus [33]) or the termination (Hepatitis C virus [34]) step. We thus postulate that, in a type A influenza virus context, a long 3\u2032UTR in the NP mRNA, or specific sequence within such long 3\u2032UTR, could affect the level or the speed of translation through interactions with yet unknown cellular factors.",

            "text": "Several functions of the NP protein of influenza viruses have been described. Among them, NP would play a major role in the replication of the virus genome. More specifically, NP would be involved in the switch from capped RNA-primed transcription (protein expression) to primer-independent replication (copy of the genome). Since negative-sense RNA molecules cannot be synthesized directly from negative-sense RNAs, full-length positive-sense replicative intermediates complementary to each segment, namely cRNAs, are required as templates in influenza virus replication. The synthesis of mRNAs and cRNAs by the viral polymerase thus uses the same genomic vRNA molecules as templates, but with different initiation and termination mechanisms [35]. Different models for the role of NP in this switch from primer-dependent transcription to primer-independent replication have been proposed. The switch was first attributed to the RNA-binding properties of NP, either by stabilizing the nascent cRNA and vRNA transcripts through encapsidation [36] or by altering the RNA promoter structure [37]. However recent studies showed that changes in the equilibrium between transcription and replication could be determined by the interaction of NP with the components of the viral polymerase [38], [39].",

Such a delay was evaluated by comparing the levels of mRNAs and vRNAs for all the segments of these two viruses at the early stages of infection (6 hours post infection at an m.o.i of 2). The crossing-point (Cp) values obtained for each kind of RNA were combined to calculate a ratio Cp-mRNA/Cp-vRNA and these ratios were compared between the two viruses. As expected according to our hypothesis, a moderate but consistent reduction of the Cp-mRNA/Cp-vRNA ratio was observed for all segments of A8 (Fig. 5). This reduced Cp-mRNA/Cp-vRNA ratio could be attributed to a lower level of vRNA production for A8 compared to wt A1 or to a slight delay in the shift from primer-dependent transcription to primer-independent replication. These results confirmed that the consequence of a lower level of NP observed by western blot for A8 was a reduction or delay in the genome replication; and this provided a convincing explanation for the slightly impaired growth abilities of A8 virus compared to wt A1 (Fig. 3A).",

Without respecting the backbone type for these structures, no infectious virus could be rescued by reverse genetics in both type A and C systems. This confirmed the results we previously obtained with the NS segment [15], at least for the proximal panhandle, but the role of the initial distal panhandle for the NP segment highlighted the differences that exist between the different genomic segments.
