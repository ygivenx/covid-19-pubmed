Furthermore, diagnosis of the pathogens responsible for disease in affected animals is uncommon and has prevented the development of predictions of genetic merit for disease risk and their incorporation into selection indexes [3].",

Disease traits such as BRD are difficult to develop prediction models for the implementation of Genomic Selection due to the lack of phenotype data. Consequently, the greatest opportunity for the development of genomic predictions (GP) for risk of BRD industry-wide is to leverage developed resource populations to generate GP with utility across environments and potentially also across breeds.",

This was interpreted to be a consequence of genetic heterogeneity in the immune response due to the presence of different pathogen profiles present within each environment as established from pathogen diagnostic analyses of deep nasopharyngeal and mid-nasal swabs taken from each sampled animal.",

Genetic heterogeneity between populations occurs when sick animals display the same clinical signs, but these signs are caused by infections involving different pathogens that elicit potentially different immune responses. When this occurs, mutations in different genes and regulatory elements may lead to susceptibility to different pathogens which also differ in their prevalence across environments, leading to an apparent genotype-by-environment interaction for risk of BRD. When this is the case, the genetic correlation between risk of BRD in the different environments will be substantially less than one and integrating data for animals from different environments will result in the identification of QTL or production of GP that have a reduced pathogen specificity. This approach will therefore tend to reduce the ability to identify variants with pathogen-specific effects on risk of BRD. Considering the cost and difficulty of creating GP training populations representing the range of U.S. cattle production environments, it is imperative that we fully leverage existing disease status data. We attempted to utilize different data types to enhance our biological understanding of BRD and better understand the genetic architecture of disease risk within and across regions.",

The first approach involved the imputation of the HD genotype data to the level of whole genome sequence (WGS) variation using a large reference panel of sequenced individuals from Run 5 of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project (1KBGP) [6]. In the second approach, we examined the effects of reducing the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the WGS imputation set that were included in the GP model to sets selected based upon a genome-wide association (GWAS) analysis of these data and a previous RNA-Seq analysis. We included SNPs located within genomic regions found to harbour QTL of large effect on risk of BRD, or SNPs located within genomic regions previously found to harbour genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens responsible for BRD based on RNA-Seq analysis [7] and the union of these two sets of variants. Recent studies have suggested the utility of incorporating ancillary information into the analysis to inform the selection of biologically relevant loci and reduce the challenge of estimating effects for several hundreds of thousands, or millions, of loci [8\u201311].",

The first approach uses a two-step data analysis in which the first phase estimates WGS variant effects and the second, feature selection step, retains only those SNPs that are located in large-effect QTL regions for the prediction of genetic merit. We recognise that this does not represent the use of independent data to identify QTL and that the estimated QTL effects are positively biased, which is commonly known as the \u201cBeavis effect\u201d (see [12] for an explanation). Consequently, the selection of SNPs in QTL regions detected in an analysis of the same data set is likely to result in a positive bias in the accuracy of GPs. We sought to quantify the magnitude of this bias by performing cross-validation analyses in which subsets of the data were used for QTL detection and the training of the prediction model which was then applied to an independent subset of the data for validation of prediction accuracy. The second approach utilized completely independent biological information to identify genomic regions harbouring genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens causing BRD and then selecting SNPs from the WGS variants located in these regions for the prediction of genetic merit.",

To estimate the accuracy of imputation, we performed a separate imputation analysis using only the 1KBGP Run 5 reference set. Here, we excluded the genotype data for the 29 Holsteins sequenced from among our BRD study animals from the WGS reference set and produced a direct measure of imputation accuracy as the Pearson correlation between their WGS imputed and WGS called genotypes. Overall mean per SNP genotype imputation accuracy was 76%. However, we observed regions throughout the genome where genotype imputation accuracy was very low (Fig. 1). The boundaries for these regions were estimated using a spline fitting analysis of imputation accuracy correlations in 10-kb windows throughout the genome using GenWin [13]. Imputed variants were then filtered either on the basis of their individual SNP imputation accuracy or regional accuracy using the regions of low (< 65%) average imputation accuracy identified by GenWin. We also filtered all variants with a minor allele frequency < 5%. This resulted in a set of 9,282,726 imputed variants for the 2703 animals for which the average imputation accuracy was estimated to be 84.2%.",

These five separate training and validation analyses were run using both the HD and the imputed WGS data sets, resulting in ten comparisons for which results are reported in Fig. 7. For all fitted models, the accuracy of GPs was estimated as the Pearson correlation between the GPs and the observed BRD phenotypes. Accuracies and fitted regressions of GPs on phenotype are reported in Additional file 1: Table S1.",

This is consistent with our results, which suggest that the largest effect BRD-risk QTL are generally not located within close proximity to genes involved in the immune response to pathogen challenge, suggesting that these QTL must have regulatory roles on gene expression.

While this approach is not by itself capable of inferring the causality of any associated variant, the biological relevance of genes, particularly those differentially expressed in response to pathogen infection suggests the utility of using imputed WGS data for refining the numbers of variants that potentially may be causal for their effects on risk of disease. Imputation also enabled the identification of relatively small regions, which could be targeted for further fine mapping using variants missing from the 1KBGP data and indels. This approach could also benefit from the identification of regulatory regions within the QTL regions and specifically targeting the genotyping of variants within regulatory regions located within QTL.

We found no evidence of population substructure between the animals from the two states (Fig. 8) which agrees with the principal component analysis results reported by Neibergs et al. [4]. Moreover, the QQ plot for the GWAS of the data for the combined CA and NM cohorts does not suggest a structural effect that was absent in the GWAS for the individual states (Fig. 4). With the widespread use of artificial insemination in U.S. Holsteins and a primary emphasis nation-wide on a single breeding objective, Net Merit, population structure was not expected and GP should be translatable population-wide [17]. The possibility of a large systematic bias in phenotyping between the regions is also highly unlikely considering the objective nature of the McGuirk scoring system and the fact that these data were collected by trained veterinary personnel [4]. Pathogen diagnostic data obtained from mid-nasal and deep-nasopharyngeal swabs taken from each calf made it clear that there were very different pathogen profiles present in the two state cohorts, and consequently, disease status classification must be interpreted from the perspective of the pathogens to which the animals were exposed in each environment (Fig. 6).",

PPARG is a transcription factor that has been shown to mediate immune responses in a pathogen-specific manner. In human Coronavirus respiratory infections, expression of PPARG is crucial for preventing a persistent infection [20]. Host PPARG variants have also been found to provide resistance to infection by some, but not all, Hepatitis C virus strains [21]. The allele frequencies at imputed WGS variants in the vicinity of PPARG (chr22:57,366,988-57,413,013 bp) were similar for the animals in the two state cohorts which would be expected if similar sires are selected nation-wide based upon their Net Merit PTA. However, only one of the 5 single pathogen challenges, Mannheimia haemolytica, resulted in the upregulation of expression of PPARG in the bronchial lymph nodes of experimentally challenged cattle [7] suggesting a pathogen-specific role for PPARG in response to BRD.",

However, selection to reduce the capacity of pathogens to infect their host may trigger an evolutionary arms race between pathogens and hosts as predicted by the red queen hypothesis, which states that rapid evolution and high genetic diversity is favoured in competitive environments [22].

This was accomplished by selecting variants from regions of the genome that had been identified as associated with risk of BRD in the combined CA and NM cohort GWAS and also regions containing genes for which expression in the bronchial lymph node was perturbed in animals experimentally challenged with single pathogens that cause BRD. Our intention was to enrich the prediction model for variants that were more likely to be trait associated and to reduce the noise in the prediction model created by the estimation of a multitude of SNP effects for variants that are not trait associated. Feature selection reduced the number of variants used in prediction by an order of magnitude relative to the imputed WGS training data, and to a level comparable to the HD training data. The GWAS for the individual state and combined CA and NM cohorts revealed BRD risk QTL segregating in both cohorts despite the differences in pathogen profiles in the two environments (Fig. 6). We also anticipated that smaller effect QTL might reliably be captured by including variants located in the genomic regions harbouring genes for which expression was perturbed in the normal immune response to BRD pathogens [7].",

However, when we implemented 5-fold and 135-fold cross validation analyses to remove the data for animals for which GPs were to be produced from the QTL identification and training model analyses, the accuracies of the produced GPs did not differ from those using the HD markers in the two-fold cross validation analyses (P > 0.05). This was not due to a difference in calibration between the analyses. Accuracies of GPs produced using the HD assay did not differ (P > 0.05) for any of the three cohorts using the two-fold or 5-fold cross validation analyses. From this, we conclude that the GP accuracies produced by the two-fold cross validation for the feature selection sets are significantly biased upward by the a priori use of the data to identify QTL regions. However, the produced GPs do not appear to be biased. Eliminating the analyses that involved training using the data for one state and validating in the other (where the genetic correlation between BRD risk was \u2212 0.36), the mean regression of GP on observed BRD phenotype was 1.04 (Additional file 1 Table S1).",

While the sample size of 2703 individuals is insufficient for the accurate identification of QTL within and across the CA and NM cohorts and also for evaluating the QTL feature selection approach, this result merits additional consideration.

Alternatively, a national genetic evaluation could focus selection on the variants that influencing risk of disease in a pathogen agnostic manner. The feature selection approaches implemented here targeted the latter goal, but did not specifically attempt to functionally validate or elucidate the biology associated with variation within the selected genomic regions. For example, a QTL may be specific to an individual pathogen that is present in both regional cohorts or may be specific to all bacterial or viral pathogens that cause BRD. This level of refinement in our understanding of BRD will require considerably more data aggregation, improved mapping resolution and biological experimentation. Selection without regard to these potential GxE effects will be effective only if the heritability of disease risk across all environments is moderate or the pathogen profiles within specific regions of the country remain stable in time. Indeed, this may explain why BRD has been persistent despite the considerable cost associated with animal infection.",

Reliance on LD and allele phase relationships between chip-based markers and causal variants, which are population specific, explains why GP models frequently fail to be translatable across populations [16]. Accurate WGS imputation may address this issue, however, this appears to be difficult to accomplish if we the imputation process requires strong LD between typed and untyped markers [26]. However, current imputation algorithms generally exploit a haplotype matching strategy which can accurately impute common haplotypes. Despite the relatively small effective population size, there is abundant variation within Holsteins. However, this variation resides on a relatively small number of haplotypes which enables the majority of common haplotypes to be captured by sequencing only a few hundred animals [6].",

However, the accuracy and large number of called WGS variants and relatively small number of sequenced individuals all impact the accuracy of imputation. One approach towards the amelioration of this issue is to assign annotations to classes of variants, and then fit classes separately in a mixture model of normal distributions with different scale parameters. If a class, such as variants within transcripts found to be trait-associated in an RNA-Seq study, is enriched for alleles that directly cause trait variation, the power to detect these causal variants should be improved by increasing the prior likelihood of association for members of this class. Such an approach is implemented in BayesRC [8]. To the extent that annotations and genotype imputation can be accomplished at high levels of accuracy, this approach should be beneficial for variant selection for GP. However, at present, both variant annotation and imputation are limited in extent and accuracy, and rather than restricting inclusion to specific variants, we defined sets of genomic regions (based on windows of SNPs) of interest and included all variants within these windows. Once the windows had been defined, the Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM) [35] implemented in GEMMA had no additional information about which of the variants within each window may be important. BSLMM assumes that only a small proportion of the supplied variants have large effects that contribute to variation in the phenotype and estimates which of the supplied variants have large effects, the magnitudes of these effects and the residual additive genetic merit of each individual due to the remaining small effect variants. Within each feature selected window, if a causal variant acted by disrupting an enhancer, for example, BSLMM would be expected to identify this variant as a large effect variant. BSLMM would also identify other loci in strong LD with the causal variant and sampling effects could lead to some of these having stronger associations than the causal variant.",

While the animals were all phenotyped using a common robust evaluation protocol [2], the genetic architecture of the trait differed profoundly between the two U.S. states. We hypothesized that imputation of HD genotypes to WGS variants in conjunction with biologically guided feature selection may enable the development of genomic prediction models in Holstein cattle with utility across geographic regions. While the genome sequence resources for WGS imputation and the annotation of identified genomic variants in cattle are limited, the continued improvement of these resources should enable this development. The use of the BSLMM applied to feature selected variants for genomic prediction reduces the need for assigning annotations or identifying causality when utilizing millions of variants to model a complex biological phenotype.",

This conversion process was accomplished using an analysis of 94 animals that had been both whole genome sequenced and also genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD or BovineSNP50 genotyping platforms. This empirical verification of the SNP allele identities was necessary as the BovineSNP50 manifest (which was carried across to the manifest for the HD assay) was found to contain a very high percentage of inconsistent A/B to ref./alt allele mappings.
