However, codon usage bias analysis provides a different perspective regarding virus evolution. Several studies have documented the species-specific phenomenon of codon usage bias [22\u201325], which refers to the preferential use of certain synonymous codons [26]. Studies on codon usage have identified several factors that can influence codon usage patterns. These include mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication, selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein and the external environment [27\u201331]. When the size of the viral genome and other viral features, such as its dependence on the host machinery for key processes (including replication, protein synthesis and transmission) are compared to those of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, the interplay between the codon usage of the virus and that of its host is expected to affect the overall viral survival, fitness, evasion of the host immune system and evolution [29,32]. Previous studies showed that the codon usage bias of PCV was low, while mutation pressure plays a key role in shaping the codon usage bias of PCV1, mutation pressure and natural selection contribute equally to the codon usage bias of PCV2 [33].",

Furthermore, to determine the influence of the host species on the synonymous codon usage pattern of PCV3, the RSCU values of Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were determined.

We used CAI and RCDI analysis to evaluate host suitability to PCV3. There were significant differences in CAI values among different host species (Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) (Figure 6(a)). In particular, Homo sapiens had the CAI value similar to Sus scrofa, and Canis familiaris, with a mean value of 0.7358 \u00b1 0.002, while Rhinolophus ferrumequinum had the lowest with a mean value of 0.5296 \u00b1 0.002 in the analysis of both, all the sequences and different genotypes.

This indicates that the highest codon deoptimization of PCV3 was towards Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. A similar trend was identified in the analysis of different genotypes. Interestingly, except for the high RCDI value of Rhinolophus ferrumequinumin in relation to PCV3a-2, the other host species exhibited low codon usage deoptimization. On the other hand, PCV3a-1 had the highest codon usage deoptimization compared to the other genotypes among all hosts apart from PCV3a-2 towards Rhinolophus ferrumequinum.

Therefore, epidemiological investigation, real-time disease monitoring and other measures to prevent PCV3 from spreading among pigs worldwide and to other mammals, is strongly recommended.

Here, we found that A/G were abundant in coding sequences. Optimal synonymous codons ending in A/T were more abundant than G/C-ended codons. Altogether, this could indicate the existence of codon bias. However, we detected a high ENC value indicating low codon usage bias. Low codon usage bias has also been observed in other PCV strains, such as PCV1 (51.36) and PCV2 (54.31) [33] and other DNA viruses, including hepatitis B virus (56.31) [46] and iridovirus (range from 35.87 to 51.81) [47]. PCV3 had a lower codon bias than the other two porcine circoviruses. This might be due to the need of the virus to accommodate to the host replication system to replicate efficiency[48].

Although CpG was not under-represented, its content was low, which could be associated with the immunostimulatory nature of unmethylated CpGs. The recognition of unmethylated CpG by Toll-like receptor 9 leads to the activation of immune responses and thus, a low CpG content could be beneficial for virus replication [49].",

PCV3 exhibited coincident and antagonistic codon usage patterns relative to its host when we contrasted the RSCU pattern of PCV3 to the host species, in agreement with other viruses such as hepatitis A virus [51]. This observed mixed codon usage pattern could be explained by the fact that coincident codons between virus and host are beneficial due to efficient protein translation, while antagonistic codons proper viral protein folding [52].

PCV3 was reported to close related with Chinese bat CVs by Wu et al .[38]. and our previous study [36]. Thus, we hypothesized that PCV3 may have evolved from bats and then gradually adapted to both pigs and dogs. CAI analysis revealed that, in comparison with other potential hosts, PCV3 displayed lowest CAI value in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, while similar in Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens and Canis familiars, which was consistent with RCDI analysis. whereas, in contract to SiD analysis, indicating PCV3 developed strong tie with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (as a origin), additionally, given previously reported that PCV3 has been detected in dogs [37], as well as the natural host swine, and PCVs related to the xenotransplants and vaccine contaminations [53,54], we hypothesized that potential cross-species transmission of PCV3, and might be risky to public health. Though, the infection of PCVs in human cells and pathogenicity of PCVs to public health was unclear [55], which still need further experimental research.",

The degree of codon usage preference was low and dominated mainly by natural selection. We also found evidence supporting the idea that PCV3 might be a potential threat to public health. Importantly, it has been reported that PCV3 infects dogs [37], increasing the potential risk of cross interspecies transmission and adding exposure of humans, though, currently, with unclear pathogenicity in human host. The findings of this study help us understand the underlying factors associated with PCV3 evolution and host adaption which will greatly serve future PCV3 research.",
