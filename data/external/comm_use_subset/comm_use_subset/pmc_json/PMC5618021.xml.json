            "text": "The newly emerging pathogen Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first recognized in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 [1]. MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory disease in the lower respiratory tract and is often accompanied by renal failure, showing similar clinical, epidemiological, and virological features to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which widely spread in China in 2003 [2,3,4,5,6]. As of June 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified of 2037 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV and at least 710 deaths related to MERS-CoV, showing a much higher fatality rate (about 35%) [7] compared to SARS-CoV (less than 10%) [2,3]. Since September 2012, 27 countries have reported cases of MERS-CoV globally while most cases were found in Saudi Arabia [8,9]. Various therapeutics including peptide inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines are under development for the treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV [10,11,12,13,14,15]. However, there are still no licensed vaccines or antiviral agents against MERS-CoV approved for human use. Therefore, development of efficient countermeasures to curb the spread of MERS-CoV is of great importance.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and belongs to the lineage C betacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae [16]. Its spike glycoprotein (S) is a class I membrane fusion protein, and contains a surface subunit (S1) and a transmembrane subunit (S2). S1 is in charge of receptor binding, while S2 mediates membrane fusion. MERS-CoV initiates infection through the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 and the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) [17,18,19,20]. Then, S2 changes conformation by inserting its N-terminal fusion peptide into the host cell membrane, after which three heptad repeat 1 (HR1)segments and three heptad repeat 2 (HR2) segments form a six-helix bundle (MERS-6HB) fusion core [10,11]. The three HR1s constitute the central homotrimeric core, and the three HR2s surround the core at the HR1 side grooves in an antiparallel manner. This strong interaction of HR1s and HR2s brings the viral and cell membranes close to each other which triggers fusion. Disrupting the process of MERS-6HB formation can inhibit cell\u2013cell fusion, which leads to abortion of the viral infection. Based on this mechanism, several peptide inhibitors against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV derived from HR2 have been identified, such as P1 [10], HR2P [11] and CP-1 [21], which prevent the formation of the fusion core by competitively binding to HR1 and blocking the native interaction between HR1 and HR2. Hence, we have put forward an idea that the blockage of fusion core formation could also be achieved through binding to native HR2 by a foreign inhibitor. Therefore, we designed a potential inhibitor named MERS-five-helix bundle (MERS-5HB) including three HR1s and two HR2s. Since MERS-5HB lacks one HR2 segment when compared to MERS-6HB, it is intended to bind with native HR2 in S2 and prevent the formation of the fusion core. A series of experiments were performed to verify our rational design.",

Specifically, biotin-labeled 500 ng/mL MERS-HR2P was loaded into streptavidin biosensors and then MERS-5HB was added at a series of concentrations: 64 nM, 32 nM, 16 nM, 8 nM, 4 nM, 2 nM. Protein dilutions were dissolved in PBS containing 0.02% Tween (Sangon Biotech), which is better for reducing nonspecific adsorption. Association and dissociation time were both set as 1200 s. The affinity of MERS-HR2P to MERS-5HB was (calculated automatically using the Octet QK software package) (Fortebio) by a 1:1 binding model, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) value was equal to the kinetic dissociation rate constant divided by the kinetic association rate constant.",

Seventy-two hours after transfection, the supernatant containing the pseudovirus was harvested and stored at 4 \u00b0C in 1 mL aliquots for short-term use [23,24]. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the pseudovirus was determined in Huh-7 (Shanghai Guidance of Science and Technology) cells as reported previously [25,26]. Briefly, serial 3-fold dilutions of the pseudovirus were made: 50 \u03bcL/well pseudovirus was mixed with 50 \u03bcL/well culture medium in quadruplicate in a 96-well white opaque plate (1 \u00d7 104 cells/well) with 8 dilution steps in total. The plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 air environment for 12 h. Then pseudovirus culture was replaced with 100 \u03bcL/well fresh medium for an additional 72 h incubation. Bright-Glo Reagent (Promega, Beijing, China), in a quantity of 100 \u03bcL, was added directly to cells in 100 \u03bcL of culture medium. After 2 min to allow cell lysis, the luminescence was measured with a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek).",

Then, MERS-5HB was added with a series of dilutions. The calculated 50% effective concentration (EC50) of binding of MERS-5HB to MERS-HR2P is 5.4 nM (Figure 2A). To confirm the binding, the ELISA assay was performed in the reverse way. MERS-5HB was coated onto a plate overnight and MERS-HR2P was added. In this case, the calculated EC50 of binding of MERS-HR2P to MERS-5HB is 31.8 nM (Figure 2B). No significant interactions were found between MERS-5HB and HIV-HR2P. In order to accurately determine the binding affinity of MERS-HR2P to MERS-5HB, biolayer interferometry was conducted. The optical sensors were prepared in advance, and consisted of a small length of optical fiber with streptavidin modified on the top. The biotinylated MERS-HR2P was immobilized on the top of the streptavidin biosensors, and the interactions with MERS-5HB at six different concentrations were monitored (Figure 2C). The interaction kinetics result showed that the KD value was 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 M, the association rate constant was 5.26 \u00d7 104 \u00b1 1.41 \u00d7 102 M\u22121 s\u22121, and the dissociation rate constant was 1.26 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u00b1 7.78 \u00d7 10\u22127 s\u22121.

Thermo-induced unfolding of MERS-5HB was monitored at 222 nm in temperatures ranging from 25 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C. As the temperature increased, the structure was slightly destroyed but with no obvious S- shaped curve appearing (Figure 5C). This helical bundle showed strong thermal stability and appeared to be folded very well, which laid a physiochemical foundation for further study.",

The RBD in S1 has already been used for development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and vaccines [28,29,30]. However, the virus may mutate in RBD to escape antibody neutralization, and the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection also needs to be considered [31,32]. Since S2 is responsible for membrane fusion, it is also an attractive target, especially the fusion core region. In the early 1990s, several synthetic peptides from gp41 in the HIV-1 envelope protein (which is equal to S2 in the MERS-CoV S protein) were identified to inhibit viral entry with high potency through disruption of native interactions between HR1 and HR2 [33,34]. One peptide, T20 (enfuvirtide), is the first HIV-1 entry inhibitor on the market [35]. Following a similar rule, several peptides derived from S2 in the MERS-CoV S protein, as mentioned above, also have been identified as MERS-CoV inhibitors.",

Here, we reported that MERS-5HB, designed by us, could bind to HR2 in MERS-CoV S2 to inhibit viral entry as well as S protein-mediated syncytial formation. The inhibition activity is similar to the previously reported short peptide inhibitors [10,11]. Although both MERS-5HB and other peptide inhibitors (e.g., HR2P) block viral entry though disruption of the formation of the fusion core, the detailed mechanisms of their inhibition activities are different. Peptide inhibitors derived from HR2 could interact with HR1 with strong binding force and therefore they are competitors against native HR2. However, due to the absence of one HR2, our MERS-5HB displays high efficacy in binding with HR2 and hence it is a competitor against native HR1. These interesting issues are worthy of being further elucidated.",
