Moreover, pneumonia was responsible for 13% of causes of death among post-neonatal (1\u201359 month) children in 2012 [2]. Several microorganisms are responsible for the upper/lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs). However, the number of studies including respiratory tract bacteria is low. Among antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing severe RTIs, this study focuses on the Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and the Gram-negative Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The importance of the examination of these pathogenic bacteria is not questionable, because they frequently cause RTIs in humans.",

Because the vapor of the EOs were used in the VPT, they were also analysed by sHS-SPME-GC-MS. sHS-SPME analysis is an effective and flexible analysis for the rapid characterization of the main components of the volatile fraction of plants [12]. In the method, 0.1 mL EO was put into a vial (20 mL headspace) sealed with a silicon/PTFE septum prior to SPME-GC-MS analysis. Using the static headspace solid phase microextraction technique, sample preparation was carried out with a CTC Combi PAL (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland) automatic multipurpose sampler using a 65 \u03bcM StableFlex polydimethyl siloxane/divinyl benzene (PDMS/DVB) SPME fibre (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). After an incubation period of 5 min at 40 \u00b0C, extraction was performed by exposing the fibre to the headspace of a 20 mL vial containing the EO sample for 10 min at 40 \u00b0C. The fibre was then immediately transferred to the injector port of the GC-MS and desorbed for 1 min at 250 \u00b0C. The SPME fibre was cleaned and conditioned in a Fibre Bakeout Station in pure nitrogen atmosphere at 250 \u00b0C for 15 min.",

The test system was developed in a four-section Petri dish (PD, diameter 90 mm, VWR, Debrecen, Hungary) containing 5 ml of 5% sheep blood agar in the case of Streptococci and M. catarrhalis. Haemophilus spp. required chocolate agar with 15 \u03bcg/mL NAD supplementation. Test medium was not added into the upper lid of the PD. All bacteria were grown in solid test medium at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h before the assay and then inocula were made by dilution in sterile 0.9% saline to 105 CFU/mL. Then three sections of the PD were inoculated with 20 \u03bcL of the selected bacterial suspensions. Different strains were spread into each section. The fourth compartment was left uninoculated as contamination control. Each EO sample was diluted with absolute ethanol (stock solutions: 0.5\u2013195 \u03bcL/mL). 500 \u03bcL of stock solution was distributed on the surface of a sterile filter paper disc (thickness 0.18 mm, diameter 84 mm, Albet-Hahnem\u00fchle, Germany). The disc was placed on the separating wall of the PD after solvent evaporation. Therefore, there was approximately 2 mm distance between the disc and the inoculated agar surface. PDs were hermetically closed with Parafilm adhesive tape (Sigma Aldrich Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) to avoid the evaporation, and they were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. After incubation, filter papers were removed and MIC values were determined. The MIC is the lowest concentration of an EO (expressed as \u03bcL of EO/free atmosphere above the growing microorganism) which can absolutely inhibit the visible growth of the bacteria. Filter paper discs containing absolute ethanol or left untreated were used as solvent and growth controls. All tests were carried out in triplicate.",

As a result, MIC values were calculated and summarized in Table 5. They were determined considering the amount of EOs and the free airspace (L) in the Petri dish. As control, absolute ethanol did not show any antibacterial effect. Among the EOs, cinnamon bark was the most effective against all investigated pathogens with MIC values in the range of 15.62\u201390 \u03bcL/L. Above 90 \u03bcL/L, thyme oil effectively inhibited the bacterial growth of Gram-positive pathogens.

            "text": "Due to the hydrophobic character of EOs, classical microbiological tests are not relevant for detection of the antibacterial activity of these substances, thus, some modifications and development of new techniques is essential for this purpose. With BDT, we could detect the antibacterial effect of EOs in liquid medium; however, the inhibitory effect of volatiles could be determined with VPT [10]. The EOs application via inhalation is becoming more frequent nowadays, especially in the case of bacterial infections of the respiratory tract [7]. Classical antibacterial assays did not model the circumstances of inhalation; moreover, they usually focus on the activity of EOs via direct contact. In opposite, VPT detect the effect of gaseous phase produced by EO vapor and they can be easily combined with other techniques [8]. It should be highlighted that VPT can also be adapted to other different pathogens such as fungi and viruses [15\u201318]. According to the result of the microbiological assays, cinnamon bark, clove, thyme, peppermint, and citronella oils showed the most potent activity in both vapor and liquid systems. Therefore, they could be promising alternatives to support the current general treatment of bacterial infections. Their multicomponent composition gives them benefit in bacterial resistance; however, it simultaneously creates difficulties in their standardization and their effects\u2019 proper comparison [19]. In liquid form, cinnamon bark was the most effective against S. pneumoniae, while thyme oil showed the best activity against S. mutans. In the case of S. pyogenes, clove oil produced the lowest MIC value, which was followed by citronella. Cinnamon bark and thyme were equally active against this pathogen, which was in accordance with previous results [5]. Interestingly, Mulyaningsih et al. reported inhibition of S. pyogenes by eucalyptus fruit oil in lower amount compared to our MIC values. Because we used EO distilled from the leaves, we suggest that the difference is probably caused by the compositions of the eucalyptus oils in the experiments [20]. Parallel to our results, a previous publication has reported the same inhibitory trend and cited strong antibacterial character of cinnamon bark and cinnamaldehyde against S. mutans [21]. Against this pathogen, antibiofilm activity of eucalyptus oil was also published [22]. Between Haemophilus spp., slight differences were observed between the EOs. Among our test materials, we detected the best inhibition in the case of cinnamon bark followed by thyme and clove, which was in accordance with previous observations [23, 24]. H. parainfluenzae was more susceptible to citronella, eucalyptus, and scots pine. However, eucalyptus oil and its vapor was previously reported as promising solutions against respiratory viruses (e.g. Influenza Virus type A and mumps virus), their antibacterial value in several studies were less potent than the antiviral effect [16, 25]. According to other reports, which support our findings, eucalyptus oil could be a more potent inhibitor of Haemophilus species in contrast with S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes in liquid phase [5, 25]. M. catarrhalis was completely inhibited by thyme in low concentration; as well as cinnamon and citronella showed similar activity against this pathogen. The same potency was observed previously by Dorman et al. and Tanaka et al., in addition, EO components such as cinnamaldehyde, citronellal, thymol, eugenol, geraniol, limonene; cis/trans citral and \u03b1-terpineole also produced activity in their test systems [24, 26].",

The reason for this phenomenon is not fully understood; however, the authors pointed out that the outer membrane of H. influenzae may have an important function [9]. However, it should be taken into consideration that due to their lipophilic character they require effective formulation to achieve the proper activity in the respiratory tract. Thus, further development of effective and economical application of EOs\u2019 special devices is indispensable in the future. [31\u201333].",

Based on our results, we suggest that VPT provides the best detection for the activity of EOs based on gaseous contact. However, BDT is one of the most suitable direct-contact assays. On one hand, only the optimized BDT and VPT are able to provide trustworthy results about the antimicrobial effect of EOs. On the other hand, the evaluation of antibacterial activity it should be taken into consideration that EOs have different characters in liquid form or in VP which results in diverse biological activity. We conclude that cinnamon bark oil possess the strongest antibacterial activity against all the respiratory tract pathogens used in our study. On the whole, it should be highlighted that cinnamon, thyme, peppermint, and citronella also showed potent antimicrobial activity in vapor and in liquid form; in contrast, clove oil was more potent inhibitor in liquid phase. Finally, in vitro and clinical studies are also required to calculate the effective doses of EOs, determine the interactions between the components and reveal their toxicity.",
