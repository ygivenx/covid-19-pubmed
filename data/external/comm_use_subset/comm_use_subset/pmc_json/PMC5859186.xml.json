We have experienced three pandemics in the 20th century (i.e., Spanish flu in 1918\u20131919, Asian influenza in 1957, and Hong Kong influenza in 1968) and one in the 21st century (i.e., pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 in 2009). These influenza pandemics have a huge impact on public health and the global economy1. Additionally, recent sporadic human infections with H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses have raised the pandemic threat of these viruses2\u20135. The continued circulation of H5N1 viruses in birds provides opportunities for them to infect humans. Indeed, human cases of H5N1 infections have been reported in several countries, with a total of 860 confirmed cases and 454 fatalities as of 30 Oct 2017, which is a case fatality rate of approximately 53% (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2017_10_30_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1). Therefore, concern over the pandemic potential of H5N1 viruses is clearly justified.",

Experimental infection of animal models with influenza viruses is an essential component of the characterization of influenza viruses. Mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates (NHPs) are commonly used to examine the pathogenicity, replicative ability, and transmissibility of influenza viruses, although each model has its advantages and limitations. NHPs have been frequently used as a model to characterize the virulence of various influenza viruses, such as highly pathogenic H5N1, and the 1918 and 2009 pandemic viruses, because of their close genetic relationship to humans6\u20138. Intranasal and/or intratracheal inoculation with a liquid inoculum of influenza viruses has been the primary method used to infect NHPs; however, a liquid inoculum does not reflect the natural infection.",

In the ferret model, these studies demonstrated that the inoculation of animals with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus via the aerosol route led to higher nasal wash virus titers, earlier onset of clinical signs, and/or a broader spectrum of disease compared with infection via intranasal inoculation despite no difference in lethality9\u201311. In a murine model, Belser et al.12 demonstrated that inoculation of mice with H5N1, H7N9, or influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009 viruses via the aerosol or intranasal route resulted in comparable levels of morbidity and mortality among the infected mice. In contrast, few reports have evaluated inoculation routes in the NHP model. A recent study demonstrated that challenge of NHPs with pandemic 2009 viruses (A/California/04/2009; H1N1pdm) through the aerosol route resulted in efficient distribution of virus in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, whereas intranasal infection led to limited distribution of virus in the upper respiratory tract14. Wonderlich et al.15 recently established aerosol infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in the NHP model; however, they have not compared the outcomes in the NHPs infected via the aerosol route with those in NHPs infected via the conventional method of liquid virus inoculation. Therefore, in this study, we compared the virus distribution, pathogenicity, and disease outcome in NHPs infected via the aerosol route with these parameters in NHPs infected through multiple routes (e.g., the intranasal and intratracheal routes).",

VN3040 virus replicated efficiently in all of the lung lobes of the infected animals in the aerosol method group, whereas no virus was recovered from some of the lung lobes of some animals in the conventional method group (Table 2). The mean virus titers in right upper, right middle, left upper, and left middle lobes of the lungs of the infected animals in the aerosol method group were significantly higher than those of the infected animals in the conventional method group [the mean virus titers in the aerosol method group were 4.31, 4.49, 4.74, and 4.19 log10(PFU/g), whereas those in the conventional method group were 1.94, 1.88, 1.49, and 1.60 log10(PFU/g), respectively] (Fig. 2). In contrast, VN3040 replicated well in the right- and left-lower lung lobes of the infected animals in the conventional method group [the virus mean titers were 3.51 and 4.75 log10(PFU/g), respectively]. Presumably, the introduction of virus as a liquid via the intratracheal and intranasal routes led to a large influx of virus solution into the right- and left-lower lobes. We assume that this also occurs in ferrets because we often observe similar macroscopic pathological changes in the lower lung lobes of infected ferrets (unpublished data).",

For this histopathologic analysis, we focused on two animals for each group in which virus was recovered from a variety of organs (i.e., #3\u20131 and #3\u20132 from the conventional method group, and #3\u20133 and #3\u20134 from the aerosol method group). Nasal cavity, trachea, lung, epiglottis, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, large intestine, and brain (i.e., olfactory bulb, cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem) were examined using hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections obtained from the selected animals. We also examined the distribution of influenza virus antigen by immunohistochemistry. We found no obvious changes and no viral antigens in most of the tissues tested, except for the tracheal and lung tissues. In the trachea, we observed mild inflammatory cell infiltration but no virus-antigen-positive cells. Pulmonary edema and inflammatory cell infiltration into the alveolar spaces were observed in all of the infected animals tested. The degree of inflammation, which had spread from around the bronchi, was different for each part of the lungs of each animal. The total pathologic scores appear to be higher in the animals infected by the conventional method than those by the aerosol method, although no statistical analysis was conducted because of the small number of animals used (Table 3). The parts of the lung section with a pathologic score of 5 are shown in Fig. 3. Neutrophils and mononuclear cell infiltration with fibrinous exudates were observed in the interstitial areas and alveolar spaces. Edema and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells into the alveolar spaces were also observed. These observations are identical to those reported in human patients who died as a result of H5N1 infection20\u201323. The conventional method group showed more severe inflammation in the lungs compared with the aerosol method group (Table 3). All animals showed virus-antigen-positive signals in the bronchial and alveolar epithelium (Table 3).",

In most cases, intranasal administration with a liquid containing the virus is used to infect animals with influenza virus; however, a liquid inoculum does not reflect the natural influenza virus infection. Recently the aerosol inhalation method has been tested in several mammalian models, including mice, ferrets, and NHPs due to its resemblance to human exposure to influenza virus. Here, we inoculated NHPs with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus via the aerosol route and showed that aerosol infection did not affect clinical outcome, but did cause more widespread infection throughout the lower respiratory tract compared with the conventional approach. The uniform infection in all of the lung lobes and the bronchial epithelium afforded by the aerosol infection system offers an advantage in some experimental settings. For example, when researchers take lung tissues for multiple purposes (e.g., virus titration, histopathology, and various OMICs analyses), they need to take samples from different parts of the lungs. Therefore, infection via the aerosol route would minimize experimental variability.",

The same phenomenon has also been observed in the ferret model9\u201311; however, findings by Wonderlich et al. are not consistent with our findings here. The differences in disease outcomes between their study and ours may be caused by the different conditions used for the aerosol infection; that is, they used a head-only exposure chamber (into which the NHP\u2019s head was inserted), which allowed the animals to inhale the aerosolized H5N1 virus with an exposure duration ranging from 15 to 34 min. In contrast, we used a standard inhalation mask, which is not a tight-fitting mask and allows the animals to breathe the aerosol mist through the nose and mouth spontaneously; the exposure duration was approximately 5 min, potentially leading to virus infection with a lower dose compared to Wonderlich\u2019s study. In addition, other parameters, such as origin, gender, and age of the macaques, as well as the conditions for virus stock generation (i.e., egg-grown virus15 vs. MDCK-grown virus (our study), which could affect the resulting infectivity of the propagated virus), may have influenced the experimental results. Since it is difficult to standardize the parameters for NHP studies, we should pay attention to the experimental conditions when comparing results across different laboratories.",
