Cyps possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and have high affinity for the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA). Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a key member of the Cyp family and was first shown to mediate the immunosuppressive function of CsA through the formation of a CsA-CypA complex. This complex binds to and inhibits the function of the phosphatase calcineurin, which normally functions to dephosphorylate NF-AT, a transcription factor important for T cell activation [1].",

CypA was first shown to be incorporated into HIV-1 virions through its interaction with the capsid protein (CA), and the interaction between newly synthesized HIV-1 CA and CypA is required for HIV-1 to induce dendritic cell maturation [4], [5]. CypA also interacts with other HIV-1 proteins, such as Vpr and p6, to regulate HIV infection [6], [7]. CypA was further revealed to interact with extracellular CD147, which is the main receptor for CypA on the cell membrane of human leukocytes, and this interaction can induce the phosphorylation of HIV-1 matrix protein to regulate the liberation of the reverse transcriptase complex into cytoplasm during an early stage of HIV-1 infection or can function in HIV-1 attachment to host cells [8]. But a recent research showed that CypA stabilized the HIV-1 capsid and antagonizes HIV-1 uncoating in vitro, indicating the versatile roles of CypA in HIV-1 infection [9]. Moreover, several lines of evidences revealed that Cyps play crucial roles in HCV life cycle. CypB was first reported to be important for HCV replication [10], but later studies showed that CypA, but not CypB, was required for HCV infection in vitro\n[11]\u2013[14]. CypA was reported to function in the replication of HCV by increasing the affinity of the HCV polymerase NS5B for viral RNA to enhance HCV replication [13], or by binding to the HCV NS5A protein to aid in viral replication [15], [16]. Furthermore, Cyps were demonstrated to play an essential role in HPV infection by facilitating conformational changes in capsid proteins of HPV, resulting in exposure of the N-terminus of L2 protein, and the dissociation of L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner [3], [17].",

The genome of EV71 contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) and encodes a polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximate 250 kDa [20]. This polyprotein is initially processed into one structural (P1) and two non-structural (P2 and P3) regions and then undergoes proteolytic cleavage into various precursors, ultimately resulting in 11 mature proteins. Among them, P1 is further proteolyzed into VP1 to VP4 to form the viral capsid, while P2 and P3 are processed into replicase proteins. For a productive infection, virions must uncoat and release viral genome into host cytoplasm, following the successful bindings with functional receptors. Enteroviral uncoating process involves sequential capsid alterations by conformational changes [21]. During uncoating, mature particles with sediment coefficient of 160S are converted to the uncoating intermediate A particles with sediment coefficient of 135S, and subsequent empty 80S particles representing the final production of the entry process [22]. The 80S particles are empty particles that have shed genomic RNA, whereas the 135S particles retain the full complement of genomic RNA but lack some or all of their content of VP4 and have externalized most of the N-terminal extension of VP1 that is normally inside the virions [22].",

Only two extracellular membrane proteins, human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) [23] and scavenger receptor B2 (SCARB2) [24], [25], as well as heparan sulfate (HS) [26], were recently identified as functional receptors for EV71 infection. Another result suggests that the binding of EV71 to human annexin II on the cell surface enhanced viral entry and infectivity, especially at a low infective dose [27]. Interestingly, SCARB2 was reported to be the exclusive uncoating receptor to trigger conversion of 160S particles to other forms during uncoating process at acidic condition, resulting in the releasing of viral genome [21]. Here we used CypA inhibitors as bioprobes to show that CypA played an essential role in EV71 proliferation. We also elucidated the mechanism by which CypA interacted with and modified the conformation of EV71 VP1 H-I loop, and thus regulated the uncoating process of EV71 entry. This CypA-EV71 capsid functional association not only provides information to understand the cellular factors used in EV71 infection, but also presents a new promising potential for the development of antiviral therapeutics.",

The results revealed that CsA clearly impaired EV71 proliferation with an EC50 value of 3.5 \u00b5M (Fig. 1C); however, CsA had a slightly higher cytotoxicity than HL051001P2 (Fig. 1D). Because Cyps are known to be involved in the viral life cycle, our interest in identifying host factors in the EV71 life cycle and antiviral agents prompted us to initiate further investigations to study the working mechanism of CypA in the EV71 life cycle and the inhibitory mechanism by which Cyp inhibitors block EV71 replication.",

We hypothesized that the resistant mutation from a serine residue to a proline residue at the VP1-243 position may increase the binding affinity of VP1 to CypA and help the virus escape from drug treatment and the depletion of the endogenous CypA. To clarify the mechanisms underlying the CypA regulation of the EV71 life cycle, we analyzed the molecular interaction of CypA with EV71 virions or the VP1 H-I loop by using a GST pull-down assay.",

However, when we replaced both S243 and P246 with alanine residues, the mutated virus, i.e., S243A/P246A-EV71, cannot bind with CypA (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). This interaction between CypA and the EV71 virion was also reduced in a dose-dependent manner after treating with CsA and can almost be abolished at a concentration of 4 \u00b5M CsA (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Additionally, the S243P mutant rescued the interaction between CypA and EV71 under CsA treatment (Fig. 3C, bottom panel).

The result demonstrated that CypA directly interacted with the H-I loop of EV71 VP1, and the mutation of the serine at the VP1-243 position to proline can clearly increase the binding affinity of the H-I loop for CypA (Fig. 3E). We also used NMR spectra to demonstrate that recombinant CypA binding to chemically synthesized EV71 VP1 H-I loop peptides caused chemical shift changes, suggesting that CypA catalyzed the correct cis-trans reaction of the VP1 H-I loop (Fig. S1). Moreover, a reported catalytic-defective mutant of CypA called H126Q [33] eliminated the interaction between CypA and EV71 virions (Fig. 3F). A similar attenuation of the interaction between the CypA H126Q mutant and virions was also reported in HIV-1 and HCV [12], [34]. Taken together, all these results revealed that CypA functioned directly at the H-I loop of EV71 VP1, and the replacement of serine with proline at the VP1-S243 position could increase the binding affinity of CypA with EV71 virions.",

When we detected EV71 VP1 expression, we found that VP1 expression can be clearly and consistently attenuated in EV71-infected RD-sh-CypA cells in comparison with EV71-infected RD-sh-control cells from 10 hpi (Fig. 4E). Moreover, the augmentation of EV71 virus RNA in RD-sh-control cells indicated that the replication of EV71 RNA began at 4 hpi (Fig. 4C, black line); by contrast, this stage was obviously delayed to 8 hpi in the RD-sh-CypA cells (Fig. 4C, red line). However, when we infected RD or RD-sh-CypA cells with S243P-EV71, the growth curves revealed a similar curve, indicating that the VP1-S243P mutant confers resistance to CypA depletion (Fig. 4D). When we checked the viral titers in the culture, we found that the viral titers in the supernatant were not clearly altered in EV71-infected RD-sh-CypA and RD-sh-control cells (Fig. 4F). We also infected RD cells by using wt-EV71 with a 5 \u00b5M HL051001P2 treatment and measured the viral titers in the supernatant at different hpis (Fig. 4A). The results showed that infectious viral production was affected by the inhibitor at -6, -4 and -2 hpi, but not as significantly as the impact on the intracellular viral genome at the same hpi. We thus speculated that CypA depletion blocked viral entry during re-infection and left more viruses in the culture.",

The results showed that EV71 binding to host cells was attenuated by CypA knockdown (Fig. 5A) and could be rescued by the substitution of S243 with a proline residue (from 50% attenuation to 90% attenuation) (Fig. 5B). We then checked the binding affinity of three reported EV71 functional receptors, i.e., SCARB2, PSGL-1 and HS, for the wt-EV71 virions without or with CypA treatment. The results revealed that CypA treatment did not lead to obvious upregulation in the binding with EV71 functional receptors (Figs. 5C-5E). Together with the result showing that CypA directly interacts with the EV71 virion, the CypA treatment is not likely to enhance the binding to all reported receptors, and the attenuation of EV71 virions that are binding to RD-sh-CypA and compensation by S243P mutation are likely to resulted in an interaction change between the virions and CypA located at the cell membrane.",

We next used a previously reported virion flotation assay [21], which is used to detect the conversion of 160S particles into other forms during viral uncoating, to check whether the uncoating process of EV71 entry could be affected by CypA. To be consistent, EV71 virions that were treated at 61\u00b0C exhibited a smaller shift (Fig. 5F, blue line) from the native peak (160S) (Fig. 5F, black line) after ultracentrifugation in a 1.1\u20131.5 g/ml discontinuous CsCl gradient, whereas the virions that were treated at 68\u00b0C exhibited a much larger shift (Fig. 5F, red line).",

Among all reported EV71 functional receptors, SCARB2 is the only one that can mediate both attachment to the host cell and uncoating [21]. PSGL-1 cannot induce the conversion from mature 160S particles to other forms during the viral uncoating process [21]. In a recent result, Nishimur et al. reported that the H-I loop of VP1 plays an essential role in EV71 recognition through one of its functional receptors, namely PSGL-1, and they demonstrated that the substitution of VP1-K242 and K244, which are located in the VP1 H-I loop, significantly attenuated virus binding to PSGL-1 [37]. They also indicated that the VP1 E145 residue modulates the orientation of VP1 K244 and thus regulates the exposure of the positively charged lysine side chain, which in turn regulates receptor binding [37]. Moreover, Tan et al. showed that EV71 binds to heparan sulfate on the cell surface, and they suggested that heparan sulfate may bind to the positively charged amino acids (including VP1-K242, K244, and R161) that form a cluster around the five-fold symmetry axis [26]. These findings suggested that the lysine residues at the VP1-242 and 244 positions play essential roles in the binding of the EV71 virus to variable receptors. Interestingly, these two lysine residues are surprisingly very close to the CypA action site in the VP1 H-I loop, which is VP1-S243 (Fig. 7B). In a very recent result, Lee et al. reported an anti-EV71 neutralizing antibody called MA28-7, which has epitopes at the fivefold vertex that cover the VP1 H-I loop [38]; this study supports the critical role of the correct H-I loop conformation in the EV71 entry step. By contrast, the binding site of the EV71 virion to SCARB2 was mapped at a canyon of VP1 around residue Q172 [21], which is far away from S243-VP1. We observed that EV71 virion binding to SCARB2 was not enhanced, but slightly decreased by CypA treatment, suggesting that the CypA function in SCARB2-mediated EV71 entry could be more complicated. Taken together, we propose that CypA plays a role as an uncoating regulator by altering the conformation of the H-I loop in VP1 during the EV71 entry through the PSGL-1 or HS-mediated pathway, and CypA has different impacts on the entry of EV71 through various functional receptors.",

During virus internalization, endosome acidification increases during maturation, at values ranging from pH 6.8 to 6.1 in early endosomes to pH 6.0 to 4.8 in late endosomes [39], [40]. Because SCARB2 was previously shown to mediate EV71 uncoating most efficiently at pH 5.6 [21], we propose that CypA acts to mediate EV71 uncoating before SCARB2 during the maturation of late endosomes. With the increasing maturation of late endosomes and acidification, the EV71 uncoating regulator transfers from CypA to the next one, namely SCARB2. A similar observation was also found for the CypA study in HPV entry. CypA treatment induced the release of capsid protein L1 from L2 in a pH-dependent manner, in which L1 dissociation from L2 was most efficient at pH 6.0, less efficient at pH 7.4, and undetectable at pH 5.5 and 8.0 [17], suggesting a complicated process during virus uncoating in endosomes.",

We cannot simply exclude the possibility that CypA may not only be associated with EV71 entry but might also affect other intracellular steps of EV71 protein translation, assembly or secretion in addition to its effects on the entry step. In our results, we actually found that the S243P-EV71 virus proliferated more slowly than the wt-EV71 without CypA inhibitor treatment, although the S243P mutant in VP1 can enhance the interaction between virions and CypA. Moreover, when we infected RD-sh-CypA cells with wt-EV71, although the intracellular genome RNA and VP1 protein level were much lower than that of wt-EV71-infected RD-sh-control cells, the supernatant virus titer exhibited no significant difference. Interestingly, the downregulation of CypB did not attenuate but actually increased EV71 RNA replication and VP1 expression (Figs. 2C and 2D), and the expression of endogenous CypB was also upregulated by EV71 infection (Fig. 2H). Moreover, the S243P mutant recovered both the RNA replication and protein expression of EV71 in RD-sh-CypA cells, but presented discrepancies in RD-sh-CypB cells, i.e., slightly increased RNA replication but decreased protein expression (Figs. 2C and 2E). Interestingly, two recent works revealed that Cyps inhibited the proliferation of HIV-1 virus, which is in opposition to the previously identified positive function of Cyps in the HIV-1 life cycle [9], [44], [45]. All these findings indicated that Cyps may have multiple functions in the EV71 life cycle and may have additional (or opposing) effects on viral assembly and secretion. This finding requires further validation.",
