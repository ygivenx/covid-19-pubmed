While the majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic or present as a self-limiting febrile illness, strong evidence links ZIKV infection with microcephaly and a range of other birth defects, including limb deformity and retinopathy [4, 5]. ZIKV is also associated with Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and a spectrum of other neurological disorders including meningoencephalitis and acute myelitis [6\u20139]. ZIKV was discovered in Uganda in a febrile non-human primate in 1947 [10], and the first human case was detected in Nigeria in 1953 [11]. ZIKV outbreaks were detected in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands in the early 21st century [12\u201316] followed by wide spread epidemics in the Americas from late 2014 onward, with a cumulative count of 583,144 suspected and 223,336 laboratory-confirmed Zika cases reported across 49 countries and territories by the end of 2017 [17, 18].",

The urgency for immediate coordinated global response was further accelerated by the Olympic and Paralympic games set to take place in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil during August 2016 [20]. As public health and medical research efforts for Zika increased across the Americas, scientists developed mathematical models to anticipate further outbreak spread, evaluate possible control measures, and gain insight into outbreak dynamics. These models used a range of data sources including case counts, relative vector abundance and distribution, population age structure, human mobility, climate information, viral sequence and serological data, and internet \u2018big data\u2019 streams. A range of statistical and mathematical models predicted the spread and other epidemic dynamics of ZIKV, as well as the burden of its complications [21\u201326].",

Such an exercise is critical, not only due to the ongoing risk of Zika globally [28], but also to inform modeling efforts for future major epidemics. We therefore undertook a systematic review to identify all published ZIKV prediction and forecasting studies during a time period which encompassed the PHEIC period and the peak and waning phase of the epidemic in the Americas. The first aim of this systematic review was to identify all published models that predicted, forecasted, or simulated any ecological or epidemiological phenomenon about the Zika pandemic and describe the predicted phenomena, the range of data sources used, and the modeling methods employed. This first aim sought to characterize the methods and data employed to answer key questions during the epidemic and to identify potentially underutilized data or methods. The second aim was to evaluate key scientific characteristics of these studies, including (i) accessibility and timeliness of the publication, (ii) reproducibility of the methods and access to the statistical code and data, and (iii) clarity of the presentation of the prediction results, including uncertainty in prediction estimates. The third aim was to describe the funding structure and major contributing sectors, such as government, industry, non-governmental organizations, or academia, behind these publications.",

            "text": "Of 2034 studies identified, 73 articles published predominantly from 2016 to 2017 met the inclusion criteria (Fig 1) [20\u201326, 28, 33\u201397]. The most commonly predicted phenomena were spatial spread (34%), followed by R0 (basic reproductive number) or RE (effective reproductive number) (29%), epidemic dynamics (peak size/timing, final size and trajectory) (28%), microcephaly burden (15%), and vector competence and ecology (12%) (Table 1). While R0 and RE are not explicitly measurable (e.g. to validate an R0 prediction), studies estimating these values were also included due to their close relationship with predictions about epidemic dynamics [24, 37, 43, 47\u201349, 53\u201355, 58, 62, 66, 67, 76, 77, 80\u201382, 89, 91]. Most of the geographically resolved predictions were concentrated in the Americas (42%) and Asia-Pacific (21%), while few studies were from Africa (4%). Across 73 studies, the most commonly used data were infection case counts, vector data, and demographic data, followed by climate, meteorological, earth science, and transport data (Table 2). Vector data included any vector-related predictor or parameter data, including: spatial distributions and geographic ranges, seasonal/relative abundance, and vector trait data such as biting rate, virus competence, urban preference, endophily, salinity tolerance, extrinsic incubation period, mortality rate, lifespan, and habitat suitability [23, 26, 28, 33, 34, 38, 40\u201344, 47, 52, 53, 55\u201358, 67, 68, 71, 72, 84\u201386, 88, 90, 93, 95, 98]. Genomic data was not used in any of the studies and few studies used novel real-time internet data streams such as those harnessing open access social media and internet search engine platforms.",

This included delays after manuscript acceptance, 25% of the studies had delays of more than 24 days between acceptance and publication (Table 3). Most of the prediction studies were published late in the epidemic, well after the peaks in reported Zika cases (Fig 2, Fig 3). Submitting manuscripts to preprint servers made results available earlier by a median of 119 days (maximum 331 days, IQR 30\u2013177 days) (Table 3). This shift led to more results being available close to the time of the 2016 South America and Central America epidemic peaks and prior to the epidemic peak in the Caribbean and the 2017 peak in Central America (Fig 2, Fig 3). Comparing the impact factor of journals accepting studies which were posted as preprints (versus the impact factor of those journals accepting studies which were not posted as pre-prints), there was no significant difference (median impact factor 4.37 vs. 4.45 respectively; p = 0.84 by Mann-Whitney U test).",

Rapid sharing of case count data during international public health emergencies, as well as open, curated, rapidly accessible baseline demographic, human mobility, climate, and environmental datasets are essential to quickly leverage modeling and forecasting efforts [110]. Our review also identified several relatively underused data streams. First, socioeconomic and behavioral data were conspicuously absent. The lack of behavioral components in these models is concerning given the importance of these factors on disease dynamics [118]. Second, real-time internet-based data-streams, such as social media and internet search engine data, were used in a minority of ZIKV prediction studies identified in this systematic review. The limited use of internet \u2018big data\u2019 in the models suggests that either these data are of lower value for epidemic forecasting or that methods have yet to be developed to efficiently extract important information from them. Such data streams may be more commonly used in forecasting in the future as their strengths and weakness become clearer [119].",

During the pandemic, sequencing platforms were employed to generate data critical to diagnostic and countermeasure development [120], but our systematic review revealed that these data were not incorporated into prediction frameworks during the first year of ZIKV pandemic. This may reflect that early molecular epidemiology studies aimed to reconstruct the invasion and evolution of ZIKV rather than forecasting future changes [121, 122]. Some phylodynamic studies were published after the time period of the systematic review, with interesting results highlighting the possibility for phylogenetic data to provide unique insight into epidemic dynamics and possibly forecasting [122\u2013124]. The relative delay of these studies (relative to those using other data sources) echoes a similar time lag of phylogenetic studies during the 2015 Ebola epidemic [104]. The lack of phylogenomic studies captured by this review also suggests that substantial bottlenecks still exist in using these data sources in epidemic response, despite advances in mobile near \u201creal-time\u201d sequencing technologies [120]. In the future, as new methods are developed, and genomic data become more readily available, the use of these data will likely become more common in prospective forecasting frameworks.",

Both categories of models have pros and cons and their use is often informed by the specific question being addressed, in addition to data availability [125]. Deterministic models may generally be easier to produce, but they may have limitations for intrinsically stochastic processes like epidemics, such as underestimating uncertainty, although deterministic models can also be implemented to estimate uncertainty [126]. Uncertainty is particularly important in this context where uncertainties are generated by the epidemic itself, data collection, and analytical approaches. Moreover, forecasts are ideally used to inform the mobilization of resources to save lives, a context in which clearly characterizing uncertainties is paramount. This is also a clear area for improvement in model output reporting; only 43% of studies entirely reported estimates of uncertainty. However, studies which did not present, say a credible interval around a forecasted phenomenon, may still have incorporated uncertainty in other ways which were not captured by the data abstraction tool, for instance a scenario analysis or incorporating uncertainty around parameters in a deterministic model.",

Further, results may have been informally shared with public health officials or other relevant decision makers prior to publication.

First, delays from acceptance to journal publication were generally minimal (median 15 days), but a quarter of the evaluated studies had greater than 24 days delay from journal acceptance to publication. Immediate posting of accepted papers, as practiced by many journals, could cut this time down substantially. Second, we found that only 30% of studies were made available as preprints prior to peer review despite endorsements of preprints by major public agencies, funders, and journals. Those posted were available a median of 119 days prior to peer-reviewed publication. An analysis of preprints for all Zika publications over a similar time period found similar publication delays but much lower overall preprint use compared to the studies analyzed here (3.4% versus 30%) [133]. This greater adoption may indicate a changing preprint culture which was also reflected by our finding that preprint posting did not have a demonstrable effect on the impact factor of the journal in which the study was published, and we suggest that pre-prints be more frequently used in future public health emergencies, echoing other similar recent arguments [133].",

Second, we did not formally search for preprint manuscripts as part of the literature searching phase of the systematic review, only assessing whether eligible manuscripts had corresponding preprints. We may have therefore missed important research that had been posted but not yet peer-reviewed. Lastly, we had to restrict the time frame for publications to consider in the review. This restriction again led to missing studies, some of which may have already been published but not yet posted in EMBASE or MEDLINE. An additional challenge with our systematic review was that we did not provide a specific definition of \u201cforecasting\u201d and \u201cprediction\u201d to reviewers (to avoid an overly strict eligibility criteria). This led to collection of data on phenomena such as R0, which is an estimate as opposed to a forecast or prediction that could be potentially validated with data.",
