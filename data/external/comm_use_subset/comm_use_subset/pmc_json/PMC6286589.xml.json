            "text": "Human adenovirus (HAdV) type 55 (HAdV-55)is an intertypic recombinant virus described originally as genome type 11a and identified from an outbreak of acute respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) in Shanxi Province, China, in 2006 [1]. In 2011, this pathogen apparently re-emerged and caused several cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia in adults in Beijing, China [2]. Research demonstrated that HAdV-55 showed the pathogenic properties of HAdV-14 but exhibited a neutralizing antigen epitope of HAdV-11 [3]. Further whole-genome sequencing verified that HAdV-55 had a HAdV-14 backbone and partial HAdV-11 hexon gene [4]; therefore, this pathogen was renamed HAdV-55 [5]. Comparative studies have shown that the ability of HAdV to cause severe disease may relate to HAdV serotypes. In adults, the emerging HAdV-55 has been reported to cause more severe cases of adenoviral pneumonia compared to other HAdV serotypes (HAdV-3, HAdV-7, HAdV-14) [6, 7]. However, there is a dearth of comparative studies, particularly in children, that address differences in clinical epidemiological features between HAdV-55 and other HAdV serotypes that can also induce severe infection (such as HAdV-7). In this study, we investigated whether HAdV-55 and HAdV-7(the most common adenovirus circulating in China that can cause severe or acute infection) have different epidemiological and clinical profiles in children, to assess if HAdV-55 virus can cause more severe infection than HAdV-7 as observed in adults.",

However, our data differed from Cao\u2019s data in certain respects. Their results showed that only 4 (19.1%) HAdV-55-infected patients were coinfected with other pathogens, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in three patients and HPIV and IFB detected in one patient, and that only 1 HAdV-7-infected patient exhibited coinfection (with Mycoplasma pneumoniae) [6]. These inconsistent findings may be attributable to different pathogen detection methods. The Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel assay is more sensitive and comprehensive than the approach used by Cao et al. Meanwhile, in our study, a nasopharyngeal aspirate or throat swab specimen was considered to be co-infected with one pathogen when either the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel assay or the selective agar plate culture showed positive result. Furthermore, respiratory tract specimens, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid collected during the entire hospital admission from patients were cultured to identify any bacteria or fungi. For these reasons, our study may have identified more co-infections than previous studies.",
