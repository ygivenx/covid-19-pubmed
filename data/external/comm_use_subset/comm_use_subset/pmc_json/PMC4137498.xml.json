            "text": "Sequencing whole genomes of potentially heterogeneous or divergent viruses can be challenging from a small or complex sample with low viral concentrations. Deep sequencing to detect rare viral variants or metagenomic sequencing to genotype viruses from a complex background requires targeted viral amplification. Techniques such as consensus PCR, Ion Ampliseq (Life Technologies) [1], TruSeq Amplicon (Illumina), and Haloplex (Agilent) [2] apply highly multiplexed PCR for target enrichment. Targeted enrichment should preferentially amplify the target virus over host or environmental DNA/RNA, in contrast to random amplification commonly used prior to whole genome sequencing. Primers designed to tile amplicons across a set of related viral genomes prior to sequencing can enrich whole viral genomes or large regions. However, high levels of intraspecific sequence variation combined with low virus concentrations mean that standard PCR primer design from a reference may fail due to mutations in the sample virus that prevent primer binding. To address this problem, we added a capability to the PriMux software distribution (http://sourceforge.net/projects/primux/) called run_tiled_primers that applies the PriMux software [3] to automate PCR primer design to achieve a near-minimal set of conserved, degenerate, multiplex-compatible primers designed to tile overlapping regions across multiple related whole genomes or regions.",

            "text": "JCVI has an automated degenerate PCR primer design system called JCVI Primer Designer, which is similar to run_tiled_primers in that it designs degenerate primers to tile across viral genomes [4]. The major difference is that it begins with a consensus sequence containing degenerate bases and selects primers with fewer than 3 or 4 degenerate bases, so that in the end a majority of strains are amplified, but it does not require primers to amplify all strains. In their examples, most of the primer pairs could amplify >75% of isolates. Each primer pair for a given region is intended to be run as a specific pair, not as a multiplex with multiple pairs. Consensus sequences with too little conservation, that is, <90% consensus, are divided manually in a preprocessing step into subgroups which can be run separately through the pipeline. The method here differs in that it takes the full multiple sequence alignment as input rather than a consensus, and it seeks to automatically design a minimal, degenerate set of multiplex compatible primers to amplify all the strains for a given region in a single reaction. The major operational difference of run_tiled_primers compared to the JCVI pipeline is that run_tiled_primers does not require manual subdivision of the target sequences into high consensus groups to be run separately by the user, and run_tiled_primers attempts to cover 100% of the target sequences in a single pass using a greedy minimal set algorithm.",

If multiple strains are present at once or if multiple forward and/or reverse primers in the multiplex amplify the strain present, the reaction will generate multiple overlapping amplicons spanning the same region, which could be problematic if exactly one amplicon sequence is needed, for example, for Sanger sequencing. In this case, the JCVI Primer Designer would be preferable since it designs primer pairs each to be run in singleplex reactions rather than as a multiplex, with the risk that outlier strains may not be amplified. However, when multiple overlapping reads with different endpoints or from different strains are acceptable, as in high throughput sequencing, run_tiled_primers should be suitable and could serve as a good alternative to random amplification when more specific enrichment is needed, and amplification of outliers is desired.",

The PriMux \u201cmax\u201d algorithm is used. Primers should be multiplex compatible since the primers for a given region are predicted not to form primer dimers and all to have T\nm's in a range specified by the user. As run_tiled_primers is a wrapper script around the PriMux workhorse, all the primer design characteristics are specified in a PriMux options file. The minimum and maximum amplicon lengths are determined by the (s, x) parameters to run_tiled_primers (Table 2), so these parameters may be omitted in the input options file or if they are present, their values will be replaced with values appropriate for the specified values of (s, x). Run_tiled_primers requires that primers must anneal within 0.5x of either end of the region. If the value of x is 36 bp or less, it is too short for two nonoverlapping primers, typically at least 18 bp long. In this case, the code does not require that adjacent regions overlap and amplicons are allowed from anywhere in each region. Small overlaps (e.g., 40\u201380) do not leave much room to find good priming regions that pass the filters on T\nm, entropy, free energy, and homopolymers as specified in the options file, and consequently it may not be possible to find primers for all targets. When this happens, increasing the overlap and relaxing the primer specifications may be necessary.",

Combining primers for all regions in multiplex should facilitate whole genome amplification in a single reaction. It may yield longer amplicons from the reaction of forward and reverse primers from different parts (FP from 0part reacting with RP from 1part gives product ~2 times the split size), depending on the polymerase processivity and the duration of the extension step, and should facilitate assembly across amplified regions. This helps alleviate cases where a primer cannot be found for one part in an outlier genome due to T\nm, homopolymers, primer dimer \u0394G, and so forth, since primers from different parts may amplify across the region. However, since primers of overlapping regions can also produce amplicons shorter (less than x bp) than the desired amplicon of length between s \u2212 x and s bp (e.g., RP of 0part with the FP from 1part), a step to remove short amplicons before sequencing may be desired. In our experimental test with MHV, the primers from parts 0, 2, and 4 were combined in one reaction and the primers from parts 1 and 3 were combined in another, so that short products would not be produced.",

The three exceptions were a single amplicon of 2830 bp from a BAC clone of Zea mays (maize) from the Ebola 3 kb multiplex, a single amplicon of 3610 bp from Methylococcus capsulatus str. Bath from the OW Arena S segment 3 kb multiplex and a single amplicon of 851 bp from a human BAC from a library at CalTech.

Each region is amplified using 3 forward primers and 3 reverse primers (Table S1; see Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/101894). For example, the A primer set consists of 3 forward primers (A1F, A2F, and A3F) and 3 reverse primers (A1R, A2R, and A3R).

For example, to ensure region A was amplified, the PCR product from the A mix multiplex was diluted 1 : 10,000 and used as template in a PCR reaction with AR1 primer paired with BF2 (Table S2).
