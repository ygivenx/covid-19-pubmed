Therefore, protein domains encoded by the SARS-CoV genome that are absent in other coronaviruses are of particular interest, because they may be responsible for the extraordinary virulence. The most prominent such domain has been identified by bioinformatics as part of non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) of the virus and appropriately named the \u201cSARS-unique domain\u201d (SUD) [1]. With a molecular mass of 213 kDa, Nsp3 is the largest of the non-structural proteins of SARS coronavirus (see Figure 1). Comprising 1922 amino-acid residues (polyprotein 1a/1ab residues Ala819 to Gly2740), SARS-CoV Nsp3 is larger than the entire replicase of Picornaviridae. It contains at least seven subdomains [2]: An N-terminal acidic domain (Ac, also called Nsp3a); an X-domain (also designated as ADRP, or Nsp3b); the SUD (Nsp3c); a papain-like proteinase, PL2pro (also called Nsp3d); and additional domains (Nsp3e\u2013g) that include a transmembrane (TM) region.",

            "text": "At present, it is completely unclear whether and how the individual domains of Nsp3 interact with one another or with other components of the coronaviral replicase complex. Also, some of them possibly recognize proteins of the infected host cell [2]. In the absence of functional data on these domains, attempts have been made to derive their possible biological role from their three-dimensional structures (see [3] for a review). The NMR structure of an N-terminal fragment of the acidic domain (Nsp3a) has revealed a ubiquitin-like fold complemented by two additional short \u03b1-helices ([4], PDB code 2IDY). NMR chemical-shift analysis suggested that these non-canonical structural elements might bind single-stranded RNA with some specificity for AUA-containing sequences, although the KD values observed are relatively high (\u223c20 \u00b5M). Interestingly, a second ubiquitin-like domain occurs in Nsp3, as part of the papain-like proteinase (PL2pro, Nsp3d, [5]; PDB code 2FE8). The PL2pro cleaves the viral polyprotein after two consecutive glycine residues to release Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3, respectively (The remaining cleavage reactions are performed by the coronaviral main proteinase (Mpro; [6]\u2013[8])). In addition to its proteolytic activities on the N-terminal third of the polyproteins, the SARS-CoV PL2pro has also been shown to be a deubiquitinating enzyme [9]\u2013[12]. Lindner et al. [13] have shown that in addition to its proteolytic and deubiquitinating activity, the SARS-CoV PL2pro acts as a de-ISGylating enzyme. Induction of ISG15 and its subsequent conjugation to proteins protects cells from the effects of viral infection [14],[15]. Since the ISG15 gene is induced by interferon as part of the antiviral response of the innate immune system, the de-ISGylation activity of Nsp3d could explain the suppression of the interferon response by the papain-like protease, in addition to a possible direct interaction between the PL2pro and IRF3 [16].",

The latter name refers to the non-histone-like domain of the histone macro2A [17]\u2013[19]. In animal cells, such domains are occasionally physically associated with enzymes involved in ADP-ribosylation or ADP-ribose metabolism. Because of this linkage and on the basis of sequence similarity to Poa1p, a yeast protein involved in the removal of the 1\u2033-phosphate group from ADP-ribose 1\u2033-phosphate (a late step in tRNA splicing; [20]), it has been proposed that the coronaviral X-domains may have the function of ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatases (ADRPs; [21]). The crystal structures of X-domains of SARS-CoV [22],[23] as well as of HCoV 229E and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) [24] show that the protein has the three-layer \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 fold characteristic of the macrodomains.",

The N-terminal subdomain (SUD-N) comprises Nsp3 residues 389\u2013517, and the C-terminal subdomain of SUDcore contains residues 525\u2013652. We call the latter the \u201cmiddle SUD subdomain\u201d, or SUD-M, because full-length SUD has a C-terminal extension of 74 residues compared to SUDcore. The SUD-N and SUD-M subdomains have a similar fold and can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 3.3\u20133.4 \u00c5 (based on C\u03b1 positions); they share 11% sequence identity (see Figure 2C for a structural alignment). Of the 14 amino-acid residues identical between the two subdomains, four form a conserved Leu-Glu-Glu-Ala motif at the N-terminus of helix \u03b14. The linker between the two subdomains (residues 518\u2013524) has no visible electron density. This is due to elevated mobility of the linker, rather than proteolytic cleavage, since we showed by SDS-PAGE of dissolved crystals that the SUDcore polypeptide (in the presence of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) has the apparent molecular mass to be expected (\u223c29 kDa; not shown). In addition to the linker, SUD-N and SUD-M are connected by a disulfide bond between cysteines 492 and 623 (Figure 2B). Disulfide bonds are rare in cytosolic proteins, but in coronaviral Nsps, examples of such bonds have been reported [25],[26].",

Single-stranded nucleotides of random sequence are only bound if they are longer than \u223c15 nucleotides. Here we demonstrate that each of the two individual SUD subdomains also binds oligo(dG) (Figure 4A). With oligo(dH), where H stands for A, C, or T, but not G, only very small gel shifts, if at all, were observed. As oligo(G) stretches are known to form G-quadruplexes, i.e. four-stranded nucleic-acid structures formed by contiguous guanines [32], we also examined the binding to the oligodeoxynucleotide 5\u2032-GGGCGCGGGAGGAATTGGGCGGG-3\u2032, a G-rich sequence present in the bcl-2 promoter region. This oligonucleotide has been shown by NMR spectroscopy to form a G-quadruplex ([33]; PDB code 2F8U). We found that both full-length SUD and SUDcore do indeed bind this oligodeoxynucleotide and that this process is enhanced by the addition of K+ ions, which are known to stabilize G-quadruplex structures (Figure 4B). In agreement with the ability of SUD to non-specifically bind to oligonucleotides of >15 bases [31], both SUD and SUDcore were found to bind the reverse-complementary sequence, but with low affinity and, more importantly, independent of K+ ions.",

In addition, there are several positively charged patches in the center of the dimer (Figure 3B), and on its backside (Figure 3C), which could be involved in binding to G-quadruplexes. We have prepared four sets of mutations by replacing lysine residues (and one glutamate) in these patches by alanines. The first two pairs of mutations, K505A+K506A (M1, at the end of helix \u03b1N4) and K476A+K477A (M2, in the loop between \u03b1N3 and \u03b2N5), are located on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain and lead to reduced shifts with G-quadruplexes in the zone-interference gel electrophoresis experiment, both with the G-quadruplex from the bcl-2 promoter region (Figure 5) and with (dG)10 (not shown). The second set of mutations, K563A+K565A+K568A (M3) and K565A+K568A+E571A (M4) are located in the loop connecting \u03b1M2 and \u03b2M3 of the SUD-M subdomain and abolish G-quadruplex binding altogether (Figure 5), again with both oligonucleotides.",

We made major efforts to produce this protein in a stable form, but with little success. Only when we used in-vitro protein synthesis, were we able to obtain small amounts of a relatively stable preparation comprising Nsp3 residues 349\u2013726 [31]. At the N-terminus of this construct, up to eleven residues actually correspond to the C-terminus of the preceding X-domain (Nsp3b). When we expressed a gene construct coding for SUD (349\u2013726) in E. coli, we observed rapid proteolytic degradation of the N-terminal segment. The relatively stable intermediate obtained had its N-terminus at Nsp3 residue 389. The N-terminal segment \u223c359\u2013388 is predicted to be intrinsically unfolded by several prediction programs (not shown). Therefore, we assume segment 359\u2013388 to be merely a linker between Nsp3b and SUD, and 389 to be the first residue of the latter. This assignment is justified by the observation that in our crystal structures reported here, the SUD-N subdomain is a complete macrodomain without any residues lacking at the N-terminus. Therefore, the protein corresponding to Nsp3 residues 389\u2013726 is called \u201cfull-length SUD\u201d here.",

SUDcore turns out to consist of two subdomains, SUD-N (Nsp3 residues 389\u2013517) and SUD-M (525\u2013652), each exhibiting the fold of a macrodomain. The two subdomains are connected by a flexible linker (residues 518\u2013524) and a disulfide bond. Even though coronavirus replication occurs in the cytosol, where the environment is reductive, it is unlikely that the formation of this disulfide is an artifact owing to handling of the protein: As the linker between the SUD-N and SUD-M subdomains is very short (seven residues), and the mutual orientation of the subdomains is fixed due to the tight dimerization, cysteine residues no. 492 and 623 will be very close to one another irrespective of the exact conformation of the linker. In fact, disulfide bonds are not uncommon in coronaviral non-structural proteins (Nsps) involved in RNA replication or transcription. Among others, they have been observed in HCoV-229E Nsp9 [25] and turkey coronavirus Nsp15 [26], but in these cases, the disulfide bond connects two subunits of the homo-oligomeric proteins, whereas the occurrence in SUDcore is the first case of an intramolecular disulfide bond described in a coronavirus Nsp.",

The original SARS-CoV \u201cX-domain\u201d (Nsp3b) has been shown to have low ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphate phosphatase (Appr-1\u2033-pase or \u201cADRP\u201d) activity [21]\u2013[23]. However, this assignment is controversial. A nuclear Appr-1\u2033-pase (Poa1p in yeast, [20]) is an enzyme of a tRNA metabolic pathway, but there is no evidence for coronavirus Nsp3 ever being translocated to the nucleus, and the other enzymes involved in this pathway are missing in coronaviruses (with the exception of the cyclic 1\u2033,2\u2033-phosphodiesterase (CPDase) in group 2a viruses such as Mouse Hepatitis Virus, Bovine Coronavirus, and Human Coronavirus OC43). Therefore, it has been proposed that the X-domain may be involved in binding poly(ADP-ribose), a metabolic product of NAD+ synthesized by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; [23]). However, we have recently demonstrated that the X-domain of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) strain Beaudette, a group-3 coronavirus, does not have significant affinity to ADP-ribose [24]. This can be explained on the basis of crystal structures: In the X-domain (Nsp3b) of SARS-CoV [23], and in that of HCoV 229E [24], a stretch of three conserved glycine residues is involved in binding the pyrophosphate unit of ADP-ribose, whereas in the corresponding domain of IBV strain Beaudette (but not in all IBV strains, see [44]), the second glycine is replaced by serine, leading to steric interference with ADP-ribose binding [24]. In the two SUD subdomains, the triple-glycine sequence is not conserved (see Figure 2C), and hence, they do not bind ADP-ribose either.",

From this, they concluded that the metal-binding activity is associated with the cysteine residues in the N-terminal subdomain. We were also able to observe binding of cobalt ions to SUDcore by following the occurrence of a peak at 310 nm in the UV spectrum, which, in contrast to the data presented by Neuman et al. [2], could be reverted by addition of zinc ions. However, when we removed the N-terminal His-tag, this phenomenon could no longer be observed. Furthermore, we note that of the four cysteine residues in the SUD-N subdomain (residues 393, 456, 492, and 507), 456 and 507 are non-accessible in the interior of the subdomain, and 492 is involved in the buried disulfide bond to Cys623; therefore, Cys393 and perhaps the solvent-exposed His423 would remain the only potential ligands for cobalt ions in SUD-N.

One potential binding site identified is in the cleft between the SUD-M and the SUD-N subdomains within the SUDcore dimer (Figure S2A); this binding site is spatially close to the mutations M3 and M4, consistent with the observation that these mutations abolish binding completely. However, we have previously shown by Dynamic Light-Scattering that G-quadruplex binding leads to oligomerization of SUDcore\n[31]. Consequently, we have also constructed models based on the packing modes of SUDcore dimers observed in our crystal structures. One potential binding site for G-quadruplexes might be in a cleft between two consecutive SUDcore dimers as they occur in both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (Figure S2B), but for confirmation, any of these models will have to await crystallographic determination of the complex. In summary, our mutation experiments demonstrate an involvement of several of the many lysine residues of SUD in binding G-quadruplexes, but as it is probably extended surfaces of SUDcore oligomers that participate in this process, it is not possible to pinpoint any single amino-acid residue.",

            "text": "The target of SUD binding could be G-quadruplexes in RNA of viral or/and cellular origin. The SARS-CoV genome contains three G6-stretches (one on the plus-strand and two on the minus-strand) and an additional two G5-sequences, which could perhaps form local G-quadruplexes. However, the G-stretch binding capabilities of SUD and SUDcore seem to have been optimized for recognition of longer G-rich sequences. By systematic variation of the length of oligo(dG), we found that SUDcore exhibits strongest affinity (KD \u223c0.45 \u00b5M) for (dG)10 to (dG)14\n[31]. The 3\u2032-nontranslated regions of several host-cell mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis and in signaling pathways contain long G-stretches and could also be targets of SUD. Examples of such mRNAs are those coding for the pro-apoptotic protein Bbc3 [45], RAB6B (a member of the Ras oncogene family, [46]), MAP kinase 1 [47], and TAB3, a component of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [48]. It is conceivable that these proteins might be targets for the virus when interfering with cellular signaling. Changes in the stability and/or translation efficiency of these mRNAs due to the binding of a viral regulatory factor could result in an altered reaction of the infected cell to apoptotic signals, or it could silence the antiviral response.",

There are 18 human genes for members of the PARP family; the prototype enzyme, PARP-1, catalyzes the post-translational modification of many substrate proteins, including itself, in a multitude of cellular processes (DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, energy metabolism, and apoptosis) [50]\u2013[52]. Interestingly, SUD-M and the C-terminal 74-residue subdomain (SUD-C) that is missing in our SUDcore construct together show a \u223c15% sequence identity (32% similarity) to the catalytic domain of PARP-1. However, the three-dimensional structures of SUD-M (this work) and the C-terminal domain of PARP-1 [53] are different and cannot be superimposed. Another feature common between SARS-CoV SUD and PARP-1 is that the latter has recently been shown to bind to G-quadruplexes [54], although it is generally assumed that this occurs through the DNA-binding domain rather than the catalytic domain of PARP-1.",

PARP-4 is incorporated into vaults, RNA-containing subcellular particles in the cytoplasm [55]. Furthermore, ZAP, a human antiviral protein comprising a C-terminal PARP-like domain devoid of catalytic activity, has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity on alphaviruses [56], which contain an X-domain similar to that of coronaviruses [23],[27],[28]. In addition, ZAP contains an N-terminal zinc-finger domain, a central TiPARP (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible PARP) domain, and a WWE domain (a protein-protein interaction module in ubiquitin and ADP-ribose conjugation proteins). In fact, ZAP appears to be part of the human innate immune system and to play a role comparable to APOBEC3G in HIV infection [57]. It is possible that this group of viruses has evolved macrodomains to counteract the antiviral activity of ZAP. Indeed, macrodomains can inhibit PARPs, as has been shown for the macrodomain of the histone mH2A1.1, which downregulates the catalytic activity of PARP-1 [58]. Having three macrodomains at its disposal, SARS-CoV may be much more efficient in knocking down the antiviral response of the host cell than other coronaviruses. Whether this involves a direct interaction between SUD and ZAP or another member of the PARP family, or competition for G-quadruplexes in viral or host-cell RNA, remains to be shown.",

Using the program Phaser [64],[65], we could find two solutions, and the C-terminal part of SUDcore was well defined in the electron-density maps. However, for the N-terminal half, only a few segments of poly(Ala) chain could be built into the maps. This starting model was then refined in BUSTER-TNT [66] using Local Structure Similarity Restraints (LSSR) [67] as non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints to give R and Rfree values of 0.453 and 0.479, respectively. The resulting 2mFo-DFc electron density was subjected to density modification using solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 2-fold NCS-averaging using DM [68]. The averaging masks were calculated and updated using the auto-correlation procedure [69] as implemented in DM. Using the automatic building program BUCCANEER [70] together with REFMAC [71] (as implemented in the CCP4i [72] interface for CCP4) in an iterative procedure for 20 cycles resulted in a model for 501 residues in 10 chains (the longest having 208 residues), in which 448 residues were assigned both a chemical identity and a sequential residue number, while the remaining 53 residues were modeled as poly(Ala) in 8 shorter chains. The R and Rfree values resulting from REFMAC were 0.374 and 0.414, respectively. This model was refined in BUSTER-TNT, again using LSSR as NCS restraints for the common parts in the already sequenced 448 residues of the dimer, to R and Rfree values of 0.269 and 0.316. The improved electron density was again subjected to density modification using DM as detailed above, but using a lower solvent content of 35% as well as anisotropically scaled observed amplitudes as output by BUSTER-TNT. The resulting density-modified and NCS-averaged map was then used for automatic model building using the iterative BUCCANEER/REFMAC procedure described above. This produced a model with 511 residues in 5 chains with 487 residues sequenced. The R and Rfree values from REFMAC for this model were 0.289 and 0.326, respectively.",
