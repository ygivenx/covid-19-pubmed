            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major causative agent of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is an enveloped virus with a 9.6-kb positive-strand RNA genome. This genome encodes a large polyprotein, which is processed by host and viral proteases into 10 viral proteins that consist of three structural proteins, six nonstructural proteins, and a small hydrophobic peptide, p7 [1], [2]. The structural proteins, Core protein and two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, are derived from the N terminal portion of the polyprotein and constitute physical virion components. The nonstructural (NS) proteins, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B, are derived from the C terminal portion of the polyprotein. Most of the NS proteins (with the exception of NS2) are involved in HCV replication [3], [4]. HCV RNA is synthesized in the replication complex (RC), which exists in the membranous web derived from altered ER membranes [5], [6]. The HCV RC is transported on microtubules and this transport is facilitated by the interaction of NS3 and NS5A with tubulin [7]. The intact microtubule network also is directly involved in HCV RNA replication [8]\u2013[10] and virus release [10], [11].",

Core protein forms multimers [13] and interacts with the viral RNA [14] to form the viral nucleocapsid. The Core protein is localized mainly on the surface of the lipid droplets (LDs) [15], [16], which is essential for the production of infectious HCV particles [15]. Further, Core protein promotes the accumulation of LDs to facilitate virus assembly [11], [17] and recruits viral RCs to LD-associated membranes [15]. Thereby, viral RNA interacts with Core protein in juxtaposition to LD for virus packaging. Moreover, the interaction between NS5A and Core protein is essential for the recruitment of the viral RCs to LDs and plays an important role in virus assembly [18], [19]. However, how viral RCs and Core protein target to LD remains unclear. In addition to NS5A, other NS proteins, including NS2, NS3, and NS4B, have also been shown to influence the production of infectious virus [12]. Up to now, it is not known whether the NS proteins are incorporated into infectious virions.",

This association of NS5A-Core proteins implicated them in virus assembly as well as release. Interestingly, we found that both NS5A and Core, in addition to exosomal proteins CD63 and CD81, were detected in the low-density HCV particles (1.083 to 1.098 g/ml) with low-grade infectivity. NS5A appeared to be incorporated into HCV particles through interaction with Core protein and microtubules during intracellular transport. Our data suggest that NS5A-containing, low-density HCV particles were released in the form of exosome.",

The colocalization coefficient of LD with NS5A also decreased correspondingly (Fig. 2C upper panels and 2D). Taxol did not have effects on this coefficient. In order to rule out the possibility that the dose-dependent decrease in the colocalization of LD with Core or NS5A by nocodazole treatments might have been the consequence of a decrease in the amounts of Core and NS5A proteins, a further analysis of Core protein (Fig. 2A and 3A, lower panels) and NS5A (Fig. 2C and 3C, lower panels) labeling in cells was carried out using the MetaMorph Integrated Morphometry Analysis. In nocodazole-treated cells, there was no significant change on the total fluorescence intensities of Core and NS5A relative to control cells (Fig. 2F and 2G). Immunoblot analysis also showed that the levels of NS5A and Core proteins in the cells were not significantly affected by the low concentration (up to 4 \u00b5M) of nocodazole or taxol used (Fig. 2H,). This was in contrast to the effects of nocodazole at 10 or more \u00b5M used in most of the published studies, which inhibited HCV RNA replication and thereby HCV protein level [8], [10], [42]. These data support the conclusion that the nocodazole treatment at low concentrations affected the colocalization of Core and NS5A with LD (Fig. 2B and Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicated that microtubules are involved in the transport of Core protein and NS5A to the LD.",

In contrast, the nocodazole treatment caused a dose-dependent increase of colocalization coefficient to 75% and 84% at 2 and 4 \u00b5M nocodazole, respectively (Fig. 3A, upper panels and 3B). Similarly, the colocalization coefficient of NS5A with calnexin increased from 41% to 69% and 75%, respectively (Fig. 3C, upper panels and 3D). Thus, the nocodazole treatment caused an increased accumulation of Core protein and NS5A in the ER and corresponding decrease in the LDs. Taken together, these results suggested that NS5A and Core protein are translocated from ER to LDs in a microtubule-dependent manner.",

In the presence of nocodazole, the number of speckles was reduced to an average of 11 per cell (Fig. 4B), indicating that the HCV RNA replication is partially suppressed by nocodazole treatments, consistent with the previous reports [8]\u2013[10]. Correspondingly, the average distance between the speckle center and the nearest edge of LD increased from 0.43 \u00b5m in the DMSO controls and taxol-treated cells to 1.63 \u00b5m in the nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the HCV RCs are normally delivered to the vicinity of the LDs through microtubule and that this transport is disrupted by nocodazole.

Therefore, we next analyzed whether NS5A is involved in the post-assembly processes of viral life cycle. For this purpose, we examined the colocalization of NS5A with Core protein in two regions of the cytoplasm, viz. the perinuclear (region just around the nucleus) and the peripheral (region just underneath the plasma membrane) regions. HCV-infected cells were co-stained with fluorescent (Alexa 647) WGA (which binds glycoproteins on the cell membrane), which serves as a membrane marker, anti-Core, and either anti-NS5A or -NS4B Abs. As shown in Fig. 5A, NS5A and Core protein colocalized both in the perinuclear region and at the cell periphery. In contrast, NS4B colocalized with the Core protein only in the perinuclear region of cytoplasm, but not in the peripheral region. Analysis of a large number of cells indicated that Core protein was colocalized with NS5A throughout the entire cytoplasm, but not with NS4B (Fig. 5B, upper panels). The total fraction of NS5A that colocalized with Core protein was 76%, while the corresponding NS4B was 51% (Fig. 5B, lower panel). Further, the NS5A-Core complex colocalized in the peripheral region in 33% of the cells, whereas NS4B-Core did not colocalize at all in the same region (Fig. 5C). We next examined the possibility that the Core-NS5A complexes are also transported along microtubule to the cell periphery. In the DMSO-treated cells, NS5A colocalized with Core protein in both the perinuclear and peripheral regions (Fig.5D). After treatment with either nocodazole or vinblastine, the Core-NS5A complexes clustered almost exclusively in the perinuclear region (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that microtubules are required for the transport of Core-NS5A complexes to the cell periphery. This observation further suggests that NS5A, but not NS4B, is involved in the post-assembly transport of virus particles.",

The HCV-infected cells were co-stained with the LD marker (BODIPY 493/503), the early endosome marker (early endosome antigen 1; EEA1), the late endosome marker (lysosome-associated membrane protein-1; Lamp-1), or the microtubule marker (\u03b2-tubulin).

In contrast, in the peripheral region, only the NS5A-Core complex, but not the NS4B-Core, colocalized with the late endosomes (Fig. 5G). Immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) further showed that the late endosome/MVB contained NS5A, but not NS4B, the latter being mainly in the perinuclear regions (Fig. 5H).

As shown in Fig. 6B, NS5A and Core protein colocalized at the plasma membrane, particularly at the membrane curvature, which has been reported to be essential for virus exit [48]. Quantitative analysis showed that the number of anti-Core and anti-NS5A antibodies-labeled signals at the plasma membrane averaged 63 and 26 per cell, respectively, whereas that for anti-NS4B was less than 1. Interestingly, some signals containing both NS5A and Core (5 per cell on average) were also detected at the plasma membrane, whereas no NS4B-Core signals were found (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, immuno-EM showed that NS5A (Fig. 6D), Core protein (Fig.6E) and the Core-NS5A complex (Fig. 6F) localized mainly to patches or clusters on the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results again suggest that at least some of NS5A-Core complexes (or the assembled virions) are transported from LD through early-to-late endosomes to the plasma membrane via microtubules.",

The culture supernatant was subject to sucrose gradient sedimentation, and the distribution of the viral RNA and infectivity of HCV were determined. Two peaks, one from fractions 7\u20138, with density of 1.083 to 1.098 g/ml sucrose (low-density fractions; LDF), and another from fractions 11\u201313 with density of 1.145 to 1.178 g/ml sucrose (high-density fractions; HDF), were found to contain distinct HCV RNA signals (Fig. 7A). Fraction 12, at 1.162 g/ml sucrose, contains the largest amount of viral RNA, consistent with the previously reported density of free HCV virions [27], [31]. Each fraction was further analyzed for its infectivity on naive Huh7.5 cells. The results showed that both the LDF and HDF from culture supernatant contained infectivity (Fig. 7B), with HDF having approximately 153-fold higher specific infectivity. Thus, both the LDF and HDF are infectious, but LDF contained only 0.65% of the total infectivity; thus, the possibility that the apparent infectivity of LDF may have come from contaminations of HDF cannot be ruled out.",

In contrast, the low-density fraction 7 (1.083 g/ml) contained NS5A in addition to Core protein, but no NS4B. Recent studies have revealed that HCV virion release requires late endosome (or multivesicular body; MVB) [10], the functional endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) [46], [47] and hepatocyte receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) [45], all of which are involved in the biogenesis of MVB and exosome secretion. In addition, HCV particles are associated with circulating exosomes in hepatitis patients' serum [49]. We therefore investigated whether HCV virion release from cell membrane occurs through the exosome pathway. We probed each sucrose density fraction for the presence of two exosomal markers viz. CD81 and CD63. Interestingly, both CD81 and CD63 were detected in LDF (Fig. 7C), but not HDF, suggesting that the exosome is involved only in LDF virus release.",

Interestingly, the virion core of LDF, but not the HDF, could be stained with anti-NS5A antibody, but neither normal IgG nor anti-NS4B antibody (Fig. 7E). In parallel, the saponin-treated virus of LDF could be stained with both Core and NS5A simultaneously (Fig. 7F). The specificity of staining was confirmed by staining under various treatment conditions (Fig. 7H). In all virus samples, normal IgG or anti-NS4B antibody yielded only background staining. In HDF, anti-CD81 and -NS5A antibodies also yielded very little staining with or without the saponin treatment.

These results suggest that the intact microtubule network served as a transport highway for the movement of HCV NS5A (or viral RCs) and Core proteins from the ER towards the LD and plasma membrane for virus assembly and exit. Additionally, it has been shown that the interaction between NS5A and Core protein on LDs plays an important role for virus assembly [18], [19], and that Core protein induces redistribution of LD to the perinuclear region for virus assembly in a microtubule-dependent manner [11].

However, only a small number (5 signals/cell) of the NS5A-Core complexes were detected at the plasma membrane of the cells, in contrast to Core protein alone (\u223c63 signals/cell) (Fig. 6C). This finding may explain why the amount of HCV RNA in LDF (\u223c1\u00d7104 copies/ml) was significantly lower than that of HDF (1.3\u00d7105 copies/ml) (Fig. 7A). We suggest that NS5A-containing, low-density HCV particles constitute a minor population of the released HCV virions. Nonetheless, this population was apparently infectious, though with slightly lower specific infectivity than the bulk of virus particles in HDF (Fig. 7B). The result is similar to a published report, which showed that less than 2% of all infectivity was in the low-density pool (density of <1.1g/ml) [20]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that LDF with very weak infectivity may have come from virus contamination from HDF.",

            "text": "Notably, we demonstrated that low-density HCV particles utilize a host exosome biogenesis pathway for the production of NS5A-containing virions. The low-density HCV particles (density of 1.08 g/ml) were also found in hepatitis C patients' serum [26], [52], [53]. Most importantly, NS5A and exosomal markers coincided with Core protein in the low-density fractions (Fig. 7C), which also contained HCV RNA (Fig. 7A). NS5A-Core complexes (Fig. 7F) and exosomal markers (Fig. 7D) were detected in purified LDF virions. Correspondingly, exosomal markers and NS5A or Core protein were colocalized at the plasma membrane, where virus release occurs, as revealed by immunofluorescence staining and Immuno-EM (Fig. 8). Taken together, the results indicated that the low-density, NS5A-containing virions are released off the cell via exosomes, whereas the high-density particles exit the cell via some alternative mechanism not involving the exosomal pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, HCV particles have been found to be associated with circulating exosomes in serum of HCV-infected patients [49]. Combined with our previous results [10] showing that HCV particles are transported from early to late endosomes/MVB, our current studies suggest that the NS5A-containing HCV particles most likely exit the cells via fusion of MVB to the plasma membrane. Exosomes have been demonstrated to facilitate the budding of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [54] and hepatitis A virus (HAV) [55]. Exosome have been known to play important roles in intercellular communications. In HIV and HAV infection, exosomes are required for trans-infection of CD4+ T cells [56] and are likely to promote virus spread within the liver [55], respectively. Similarly, exosome-containing HCV virions might fuse to uninfected cell in a mechanism independent of viral envelope proteins and may contribute to HCV natural infection.",

However, in contrast to our observation, Merz et al. [24] could not observe any NS5A in the virus preparation after affinity purification. The reason for this discrepancy may lie in the sensitivity of detection methods and the method of virus purification, as NS5A was detected only in a minor population of low-density particles in our study. It was also possible that the affinity tag used in the previous study [24] could not be detected in the low-density HCV particles.",

Recently, an amphipathic \u03b1-helical peptide (AH) containing the N-terminal 31 amino acids of NS5A was shown to induce swelling of the vesicles leading to vesicle lysis [61]; in addition, the infectivity of HCV particle was reduced when HCV virions were first treated with the AH peptide, causing the disruption of HCV envelope [62]. Taken together, the data presented here and elsewhere show that NS5A may induce fusion and lysis of lipid vesicles as well as virus particles during the virus entry step. Since NS5A is present inside the virus particles, it is likely that these membrane-altering functions of NS5A could function at a post-binding step, namely, after the virus envelope has been disrupted. Indeed, a postbinding fusion step within an acidic endosomal compartment is required for HCV entry [63]. This will be an interesting topic to study in the future.",
