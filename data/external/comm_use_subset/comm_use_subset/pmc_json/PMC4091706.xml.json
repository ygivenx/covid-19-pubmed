In developed countries this task is generally facilitated by the existence of data or statistics at the national or regional level tracking individuals' movements and travels, by purpose, mode, and other indicators if available (see e.g. transport statistics in Europe [1], commuting, migration data or other types of mobility at country level [2]\u2013[6]). Access to highly detailed and updated data may however still be hindered by national privacy regulations, commercial limitations, or publication delays. The situation becomes increasingly complicated in less-developed regions of the world, where routine data collection may not be envisioned at similar levels of details [7], but which, most importantly, may be characterized by a high risk of emergence and importation of infectious disease epidemics or may suffer of endemic diseases.",

For rapid directly transmitted infections, daily movements of individuals represent the main mean of spatial transmission. At the worldwide scale, air travel appears to be the most relevant factor for dissemination, as observed during the SARS epidemic [8], [9] and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [10], [11]. On smaller regional scales, instead, daily commuting is significantly linked to the spread of seasonal influenza [12], [13], affecting the epidemic behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure [14].",

Such direction of research has gained great popularity, leading to the discovery of universal characteristics of individual mobility patterns, and the possibility to study mobility in space and at timescales that were unreachable before [21]\u2013[26]. Such increasing volumes of finely resolved human mobility data, thanks to the near ubiquity of mobile phones, also offered an opportunity to contrast the huge deficit of quantitative data on individual mobility from underdeveloped regions. They were indeed used to shed light on malaria diffusion and identify hotspot areas [24], [26], [27], to monitor human displacements in case of natural disasters [25], [28] and to study disease containment strategies in Ivory Coast [29].",

The radiation model requires population distribution values and the total commuter flows out of a given region, a quantity that may not be easily accessible at the desired level of resolution or with sufficient coverage. While mobile phone data can provide mobility information at a high granularity level, they are also characterized by a number of issues that may hinder their use. Phone data are inevitably affected by biases related to the population sampling: coverage is usually not homogenous across space and it depends on the market share of the operator providing the data. Phone ownership and usage may differ across social groups, gender or age classes depending on the country under study [30], [31], and access to users' metadata to evaluate the representativeness of the sample is limited by privacy concerns [32].

We first compare the commuting networks extracted from the official census surveys of three European countries (Portugal, Spain and France) to the corresponding proxy networks extracted from three high-resolution datasets tracking the daily movements of millions of mobile phone users in each country. More specifically, we examine through a detailed statistical analysis the ability of mobile phone data to match the empirical commuting patterns reported by census surveys at different geographic scales. We then examine whether the observed discrepancies between the datasets affect the results of epidemic simulations. To this aim, we compare the outcomes of stochastic SIR epidemics simulated on a metapopulation model for recurrent mobility that is based either on the mobile phone commuting networks or the radiation model commuting networks, with respect to the epidemics simulated by integrating the census data. We evaluate how the simulated epidemic behavior depends on the underlying mobility source and on the spatial resolution scale considered, by investigating the time to first infection in each location and the invasion epidemic paths from the seed.",

The data allows us to identify the set of locations visited by each user (georeferenced in terms of tower cells) and to rank them according to the total number of calls placed by a user from each of them. Only users with more than 100 calls are included in the study, to enable the estimation of the individual's commuting mobility pattern. Since mobile phone trajectories clearly include different sorts of daily movements, we need therefore to extract commuter movements only for the comparison with census data, and disregard other types of displacement. Following previous work [22], we assume that a user's residence corresponds to his/her most visited location, and that his/her workplace corresponds to the second most visited location, both identified in terms of placed calls. We performed a sensitivity analysis on this minimal assumption, by imposing in addition some constraints on the time of the call, to refine our identification of locations of residence and workplace (see Text S1 for additional details) [35], [38]. We thus define a commuting network at the level of cell sites, creating a directed link between each residence and workplace and assigning a weight equal to the total number of users that commute between the two locations. We coarse-grain the mobile phones commuting network from the tower cell scale to the country's administrative subdivisions for comparison with the census data (see Section 1.3 in Text S1 for additional details). The coarse-grained mobile phone commuting data is available as supporting information (Dataset S1).",

We explored the geographic coverage of the mobile phone dataset for the three countries (see the Analyses subsection for the corresponding methodology adopted).

The model has been specifically developed to reproduce commuter movements and has the additional desirable feature of being parameter-free, i.e. it does not require regression analysis or fit on existing data. These characteristics make it the ideal candidate to generate a synthetic commuting network in absence of empirical data to be fitted. The model is based on a stochastic decision process assigning work locations to each potential commuter, thus determining the daily commuting fluxes across the country. In detail, networks are generated by creating a fully connected topology between country's locations, where the weight of the edge connecting a node  with a node  is defined by the formula [18]:(1)with  and  being the populations of origin and destination,  the total population living between location  and location  (computed as the total population living in a circle of radius  centered at , excluding the populations of origin and destination locations), and  the total number of commuters daily leaving their home in location . Equation (1) assumes the knowledge of population data (, , ) similarly to what we consider available for the census commuting networks and for the basic normalization of mobile phone mobility commuting fluxes, but it also requires additional information, i.e. the total number of residents who commute in each administrative unit. While the latter information may be easily accessible in developed countries, it is important to note that it may not be routinely collected or available in other regions. Given these quantities, the radiation model yields a commuting flux for each pair  of administrative units of the country under study; after removing connections having , a synthetic commuting network at the given resolution scale is obtained. Previous works have already shown the ability of the radiation model to match census data well from the structural and traffic point of view, in a number of countries [18]. Additional comparisons between the radiation model and gravity models have been performed in the UK [39]. Here therefore we do not consider the radiation model in the comparison analysis of commuting networks and discuss instead its adequacy in the framework of spatial epidemic spreading.",

We consider a simple SIR compartmental model [41], where individuals can be either susceptible (S), infectious (I) or recovered (R) from the infection, assuming a life-long immunity for recovered individuals. The dynamics is discrete and stochastic and individuals are assumed to be homogeneously mixed within each subpopulation. No additional substructure of the population is considered (e.g. schools or workplaces), as our aim is to introduce a rather simple epidemic model to test the adequacy of different commuting sources for the simulation of ILI dissemination within a country.

On the other hand, the most probable path of infection from one subpopulation to another appears to be affected by more substantial discrepancies between the different sources of data or synthetic flows that cannot be overcome through a simple normalization. To further improve predictions on the path of invasion, we would need to comprehensively understand the causes behind the differences observed in the data analysis.

If we identify these two locations as the two most visited ones [22], by definition, we are assuming that place of residence and place of work are two distinct locations, yielding that every mobile phone user is a commuter at the resolution level of the cell phone towers. Once aggregated at a larger scale (i.e. the various administrative units under consideration), we obtain a population made of individuals living and working in the same unit (non-commuters) and of individuals commuting between two different units. While aggregation leads to a certain fraction of non-commuters, the resulting commuting behavior \u2013 expressed by the ratio of commuters vs. non-commuters \u2013 is anyway more pronounced likely because of the intrinsic assumption made on the original identification of home/work locations from the data. Different choices can be made that can improve the correct identification of home/work locations, leveraging on the availability of additional data. If timing of the call activity is provided, one possible refined definition would be to identify as home location the tower cell with the largest activity during nighttime, and the work location as the one with the largest activity constrained to daytime (with variations of the definition of these intervals) [32], [33], [38], [56]. We tested this approach in the Portuguese dataset and found that the identification of the two locations was not substantially altered by the time-constrained definition chosen, and did not affect our results (see Text S1).",

Biases may be induced by mobile phones ownership, with fluctuations strongly dependent on socio-economic status [31], [58], and by market share of the specific operator providing the data, In Spain, for example, the strong undersampling of the population in Galicia and Basque region, characterized by a strong political and cultural identity, may be due to the presence of local operators that account for a larger market share than what observed at national level. In Portugal, we observe larger fluctuations per region around the average national coverage than in other countries. Predictions for the invasion path obtained with mobile phones for epidemics starting in the capital of the country are not in good agreement with those obtained with census flows (, Figure 4). In this case, the central role of the capital, responsible for leading to higher similarity as discussed before, is reduced by the presence of larger (and overestimated) flows connecting less central regions in the mobile phone dataset. This leads to the creation of leaves stemming from peripheral nodes and infecting the closest neighbors, thus strongly reducing the role of the seed in infecting the large majority of nodes at the first generation of invasion. This phenomenon is effectively similar to the one encountered when the epidemic is seeded in a peripheral location.",

We have no information on users' age in the mobile phone dataset, therefore movements for work or study are both tracked in users' trajectories. Commuting for study reasons is included in the Portuguese and French census data, whereas Spain reports about workflows only. The impact of not considering students' commuting in the Spanish case is however estimated to be rather low. Spanish data is indeed collected at a high administrative level (provinces), where students' commuting flows may be very weak given that they are usually more localized than those of workers. Data from France shows that 95% of students (aged<15) travel on distances less than 10 km [4]. To estimate the impact of missing students in the Spanish dataset on the province scale, we examined the fraction of commuter movements of students in the French census commuting network aggregated at the level of regions, i.e. similar to the size of Spanish provinces. In France, students represent about 10% of the total commuting flows across regions. If we assume a similar statistics for Spain too, such ratio is not sufficient to explain the discrepancy observed between the normalized mobile phone commuting flows and the census commuting flows in Spain (Table 1). In addition, the lack of a portion of individuals in the dataset (e.g. students) would have no impact when using the refined normalization because, in that case, the total number of commuters is set to be equal in both data sets by definition.",

In the case of France, the two datasets belong to the same year (2007). To assess the possible changes in commuting flows with time, we analyzed French yearly data between 2006 and 2009, given their availability (see Table S1 in Text S1). In three years, the total number of commuters in the country increased by about 3%, and every year, the total number of commuters increased by 1% or less.

For the sake of completeness, we also checked our results against the inclusion of cross-border commuting in the census network of France, where international movements are predominant in a subset of districts (for instance, in those bordering Switzerland).
