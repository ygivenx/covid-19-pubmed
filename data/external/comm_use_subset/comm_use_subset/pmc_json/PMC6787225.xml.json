Recently, it has been found that soluble CD163 also may be a potential diagnostic parameter for monitoring the activity of macrophage in inflammatory diseases11. CD204 is a Class A scavenger receptor that is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the pattern recognition of pathogen infection12. CD206 is a macrophage mannose receptor 1 that is strongly expressed in prostate adenocarcinoma, and the number of CD206-positive TAM was correlated with poor prognosis of the disease13.",

Stage of the tumor was classified as stated in the TNM classification of the International Union Against Cancer. WHO classification was used to determine the tumor histologic grade. According to the Yamamoto-Kohama clinical classification of OSCC the pattern of tumor invasion was assessed from the H&E-stained specimens as: grade 1 = well-defined borderline; grade 2 = cords, less-marked borderline; grade 3 = groups of cells, no distinct borderline; and grade 4 = diffuse invasion (4C = cord-like type invasion; 4D = widespread type invasion).

The AUC area of DFS-related ROC curves of CD163+, CD204+, and CD206+ expression were 0.542, 0.534, and 0.659, respectively, and that of DSS-related ROC curves of CD163+, CD204+, and CD206+ expression were 0.570, 0.576, and 0.615, respectively (Fig. 4B).

Macrophages are divided into two functionally distinct subtypes: classically activated (M1) macrophages, which are stimulated by T helper type 1 (Th1) responses, and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, which stimulated by Th2 responses7,8. M1 macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and contribute to tumor suppression, whereas M2 macrophages express anti-inflammatory cytokines and have been shown to contribute to tumors by promoting angiogenesis, immunosuppression and activation of tumor cells25. Recent studies have described M2-polarized macrophages as TAMs, which highly express markers, including CD163, CD204, and CD20626\u201328.",

Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated marked differences in the localizations of CD163+, CD204+, and CD206+ cells in OSCC tissues. Interestingly, CD206+ cells, from PBMCs of OSCC patients, strongly produced EGF compared with the other TAM subsets. In addition, OSCC cells showed high viability and invasion activity after co-culture with CM of CD206+ cells and a significant decrease in their viability with anti-EGFR antibody. These results suggest that CD206+ TAMs might play an important role in the proliferation and invasion of OSCC via EGF secretion. Goswami et al.35 found a paracrine loop between breast carcinoma cells and macrophages through EGF and colony stimulating factor 1 production, leading to increased carcinoma cell invasion. While this paracrine loop might be also involved in the invasion activity in OSCC cells, further examinations are needed to clarify the expression of other cytokines secreted by TAM subsets in OSCC.",

Notably, a high number of CD206+ TAMs was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Recently, Dong et al.36 reported that the high presence of CD206+ TAMs in hepatocellular carcinoma markedly correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and were associated with poor prognosis. These results were consistent with our results. In contrast, in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, both CD204+ and CD206+ TAMs were not associated with clinical outcome37.
