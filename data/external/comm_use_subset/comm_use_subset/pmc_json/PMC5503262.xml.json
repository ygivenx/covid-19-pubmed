The first biological ZIKV sample was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 [3], and it was later found ZIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. However since 2007, large epidemics of Asian genotype ZIKV have been reported around the world [4,5]. Recently it is estimated that one-third of the world population might be at risk of infection [6]. The rapid rise in ZIKA infection is compounded by the ease of vertical [7] and sexual human-to-human transmissions [8]. Recent studies have associated ZIKV infection with other diseases: Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and microcephaly in newborn infants of mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy [7,9\u201311], thrombocytopenia [12], multiple-organ failures [13], and possibly male infertility [14]. Consequently WHO has declared a public health emergency for ZIKV infection [15]. ZIKV represents a significant challenge to the public health of the whole world but unfortunately there is no available effective vaccine or therapy so far.",

ZIKV shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology with other flaviviruses particularly dengue virus, thus resulting in immunological cross-reactivity [17]. Current Zika outbreaks are largely localized within dengue-endemic areas, it is thus proposed that preexisting dengue-induced antibodies may enhance Zika infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a factor that makes the vaccine approaches extremely challenging [17]. While several recent studies focused on the possibility of developing neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV [18\u201320], it may take quite a while before such neutralizing antibodies for ZIKV enter clinical trials.",

            "text": "ZIKV genome is translated into a single ~3,500-residue polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 3 structural proteins and 7 non-structural proteins [16]. The correct processing of the polyprotein is essential for replication of all flaviviruses, which requires both host proteases and a viral NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) and this property makes the flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro a well-established target for developing antiviral drugs [16,21\u201332]. While there are studies testing the inhibition effects of certain drugs on NS2B-NS3pro such as bromocriptine [33], boronate [34], or small compounds inhibitors [35], we are interested in new chemical scaffolds that are found in the edible foods. Our focus here is on whether natural edible products contain small molecules that have some inhibitory effects on the enzymatic activities of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro. Thus in the present study, we have characterized the solution conformations and catalysis of two enzymatically active Zika NS2B-NS3pro: one with NS2B and NS3pro linked by extensively used (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 sequence; and another with NS2B and NS3pro unlinked. Subsequently, we identified several small molecular inhibitors from edible plants: five flavonoids and one natural phenol which were shown to inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in a non-competitive mode. Further molecular docking suggests that these molecules inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro by binding to a pocket on the back of the active site and allosterically affect the structure-activity property of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. As such, identification of these natural product inhibitors here night provide new avenues for development of allosteric inhibitors against ZIKV infection.",

Furthermore, it has been previously demonstrated that only the unlinked Dengue NS2B-NS3pro manifested well-dispersed NMR spectra [30,31]. Therefore, we went on further to express the isolated Zika NS2B and NS3pro. While the NS3pro protein was found to be in inclusion body, the NS2B was detected in supernatant. So we purified them by Ni2+-affinity column under denaturing condition for NS3pro and under native condition for NS2B. We first attempted to refold NS3pro alone without NS2B by dialyzing NS3pro overnight against PBS buffer (pH 7.4) with 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, but all NS3pro protein precipitated during dialysis and no enzymatic activity could be detected, suggesting that Zika NS3pro domain also needs NS2B to fold correctly, as previously observed on all other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro [21\u201331]. However, using the same protocol, the mixture of NS2B and NS3pro was easily refolded into the soluble complex (column 2 of S1D Fig), was subjected to further cleavage of His-tag and the final FPLC purification (column 3 of S1D Fig). As small peptides diffuse significantly and thus usually cannot be seen in the SDS-PAGE system we used here, we checked the presence of the NS2B peptide in the finally purified unlinked NS2B-NS3pro complex by the reverse-phase (RP) high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an analytic C8 column. The HPLC profile clearly showed that two peaks exist: one with the shorter retention time is for NS2B while another with the longer retention time is for NS3pro (S1F Fig).",

            "text": "First we acquired 1H NMR one-dimensional spectra for both linked and unlinked NS2B-NS3pro (Fig 1A). Both spectra have similar up-field peaks, which can only be observed on a well-folded protein with the tight tertiary packing and will disappear even upon a slight disruption to its tight tertiary packing [36]. Fig 1A clearly indicates both linked and unlinked complexes are well folded. An interesting note here is the peaks of linked complex are broader than those of the unlinked complex, which implies the linkage between NS2B and NS3pro introduced additional \u03bcs-ms conformational dynamics; this phenomenon was observed for the linked Dengue NS2B-NS3pro [21,30,31]. While this linkage significantly facilitated the crystallization of the linked flavi-viral NS2B-NS3pro complexes [27\u201329], this linkage significantly broadened NMR signals of linked NS2B-NS3pro complexes [21,30,31]. Thus, high-resolution NMR can be done on the unlinked form of Dengue NS2B-NS3pro which was found to manifest well-dispersed NMR spectra [30,31]. Similarly here, the linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro also had broad NMR signals and consequently only a very small portion of HSQC peaks could be detected (Fig 1B). By contrast, the unlinked complex had sharper 1D up-field peaks (Fig 1A) and a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum (Fig 1B).",

While 15N-labeled ZIKV NS2B in complex with unlabeled ZIKV NS3pro had a narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum with only ~29 peaks detectable (S2B Fig), Dengue NS2B in complex with Dengue NS3pro domain has a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum (S2C Fig) [21,30,31] which unambiguously indicates Dengue NS2B has a tight tertiary packing unlike the Zika one. Therefore, our results suggest that in the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex, NS2B has a portion of residues undergo \u03bcs-ms dynamics which made their NMR peaks too broad to be detectable; while the rest of NS2B is highly disordered and lacks tight tertiary packing, which results in a narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum (S2B Fig).",

CD studies provide another piece of evidence that Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes contain more disordered regions than the Dengue one. We have also collected spectra of intrinsic UV fluorescence from five Trp residues in both linked and unlinked NS2B-NS3pro complexes (Fig 1D), and both complexes have similar spectra with the emission maxima ranging from 344 to 348 nm, very similar to what were observed on the linked NS2B-NS3pro complexes of all four Dengue serotypes (348 nm) [25], which suggests that in Zika NS2B-NS3pro, all five Trp residues are similarly buried as Dengue ones, as Trp residue in the unfolded proteins has an emission maximum wavelength > 352 nm [37].",

Furthermore, we titrated the 15N-labeled NS2B in complex with unlabeled NS3pro by adding unlabeled BPTI, which is a tight inhibitor and converts open conformation of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes to the closed form by both NMR [31] and crystallography [40]. Here, upon adding BPTI, the HSQC peaks of Arg73-Ser85 disappeared and only very weak HSQC peaks of Leu86-Lys100 were detectable (Fig 2D). Previously, we have characterized many binding interactions by NMR and found that the binding-induced disappearance of HSQC peaks was due to intermediate binding affinity (with Kd values between nM and \u03bcM), or/and enhancement of \u03bcs-ms dynamics triggered by binding and binding interactions between two well-folded proteins [41] and between disordered peptides and a well-folded protein [42]. Our NMR results here indicated that only C-terminal residues of ZIKV NS2B remained disordered both in the complex form (Arg73-Lys100; Fig 2E) and in presence of BPTI (Leu86-Lys100; Fig 2F), and the conformation of these C-terminal residues in ZIKV NS2B in these two forms are similar to the uncomplexed form as their HSQC peaks are superimposable (Fig 2C). Our observations are also supported by two independent observations: the C-terminal residues of NS2B beyond Val87 are completely invisible in the crystal structure of Zika NS2B-NS3pro in the closed conformation [34]; a report on the apo/open-form of Zika NS2B-NS3pro [43] stated \u201c\u2026 C-terminus of NS2B (residues 69\u201387) is largely unseen, highlighting its high intrinsic flexibility.\u201d In sharp contrast, the crystal structure of apo DENV NS2B-NS3pro complex showed the C-terminal loop of NS2B adopts a defined conformation despite some discontinuous electron densities beyond residue 76 [27].",

            "text": "So why do Zika and Dengue NS2B have such radical differences in conformations and dynamics? Examination of NS2B sequences reveals that the Zika NS2B region corresponding to the Dengue NS2B Glu91-Thr96 shows no sequence homology at all (S3 Fig), thus implying sequence variations over this region may at least partly account for the loss of the contacts between the Zika NS2B and NS3pro corresponding to the Dengue NS2B Gln93-Leu95 and NS3pro Leu31-Ser34, thus leading to the high dynamics of Zika NS2B C-half. Thus we cloned and expressed a His-tagged Zika NS2B (48\u201374) with the C-half deleted. Despite its low expression level and insolubility, we managed to purify a sufficient amount of NS2B (48\u201374) for refolding with NS3pro with the same protocol described above. Interestingly, NS2B (48\u201374) is sufficient to form a soluble complex with NS3pro (S1E Fig). However, its NMR peaks are broader than those of the linked NS2B-NS3pro (Fig 1A), which is likely due to \u03bcs-ms conformational dynamics or/and dynamic aggregation. On the other hand, its intrinsic UV fluorescence spectrum indicates that its four Trp residues are similarly buried as linked and unlinked Zika complexes with the full-length soluble domain of NS2B (Fig 1D). Most interestingly, this complex with the C-half of NS2B deleted contains less amount of disordered region than both linked and unlinked Zika complexes with the full-length NS2B, as seen by its CD spectrum having maximal negative signal shifted to 207 nm and has positive elliptical signal at 191 nm (Fig 1C), Despite being less disordered, this complex (with the later C-half of NS2B deleted) showed no detectable enzymatic activity even with the protease concentration up to 20 \u03bcM, which suggests this complex is enzymatically inactive. Previously, we generated a truncated Dengue NS2B with the same C-half deleted but the shorter NS2B is unable to form a soluble complex with its NS3pro [21]. However, we also generated another truncated Dengue NS2B with only residues 77\u201384 deleted, which was designated as NS2B (48\u2013100; \u039477\u201384). Interestingly, NS2B (48\u2013100; \u039477\u201384) was able to form a soluble but inactive complex with its NS3pro, which appeared to be highly disordered as reflected by its CD spectrum, and highly dynamic as judged by its NMR spectrum [21].",

However, upon conversion into closed conformation such as triggered by BPTI binding, the NS2B residues Arg73-Ser85 become further bound to the NS3pro domain. On the other hand, our results suggest that despite being intrinsically disordered [44], the C-half of Zika NS2B is absolutely required for implementing the catalytic actions, thus implying that the closed conformation might be enzymatically-active, which was also previously speculated [27\u201330,34,40].

To allow comparison with the previously published results on the (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 linked NS2B-NS3 proteases of all four Dengue serotypes [26], we have selected the same three substrates. These substrates, namely Bz-nKRR-AMC, Boc-GRR-AMC and Boc-GKR-AMC, were extensively used for characterization of other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro. Moreover, we have used the same buffer as previously published [26], for the measurement of proteolytic activities. Furthermore, the effects of salts and organic solvents on the Zika protease activity were assessed. Interestingly, as shown in S4A Fig, the Zika NS2B-NS3pro efficiently cleaved Bz-nKRR-AMC, but unexpectedly showed weak activity on other two substrates. These results imply that besides requiring dibasic residues at the P1 and P2 sites (which is characteristic of the flaviviral NS3 proteases), Zika NS2B-NS3pro appears to have a higher need for a basic residue at P3 site than Dengue complexes [26]; as our current focus was not on profiling substrate specificity, we did not test this hypothesis on more substrates but instead measured all kinetic constants of Zika complexes with Bz-nKRR-AMC.",

Subsequently, we have determined their values of IC50 (S5 Fig and Table 2); and inhibitory constant Ki (Fig 3C; Table 2). Noticeably, despite sharing the same scaffold, five flavonoids have very distinctive inhibitory effects, with Myricetin being the highest (IC50 of 1.26 \u03bcM and Ki of 0.77 \u03bcM) and Apigenin the weakest (IC50 of 56.32 \u03bcM and Ki of 34.02 \u03bcM). On the contrary, no inhibitory activity was detected even at a compound concentration up to 500 \u03bcM for Daidzein, an isoflavone; as well as Catechine that has a chemical structure identical to that of Quercetin, except that the C-ring of Catechin is a dihydropyran heterocycle (Fig 3B). Noticeably, Isorhamnetin, also called 3\u2019-Methylquercetin, has a much weaker inhibitory activity (IC50 of 15.46 \u03bcM and Ki of 6.22 \u03bcM) than Quercetin (IC50 of 2.42 \u03bcM and Ki of 1.12 \u03bcM), although Isorhamnetin is a derivative of Quercetin only with proton of the hydroxyl group at 3\u2019 position of phenyl ring replaced by a methyl group (Fig 3A). By contrast, Quercetin and Luteolin have almost the same inhibitory activity (Table 2), although a hydroxyl group at 3 position of benzopyran ring is absent in Luteolin (Fig 3A). Furthermore, a significant inhibitory effect (IC50 of 3.45 \u03bcM and Ki of 2.61 \u03bcM) was detected for Curcumin, a natural phenol with two aromatic rings linked by heptadiene group (Fig 3A), while no inhibitory effect was detected for Resveratrol, also a natural phenol with two aromatic rings but linked by unsaturated ethene group (Fig 3B).

This indicates that these compounds inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in a non-competitive mode. In other words, six compounds are most likely to allosterically inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro with their binding sites having no overlap with that for the substrate. Indeed, previously Myricetin and Quercetin have been characterized to allosterically inhibit Dengue-2 NS2B-NS3pro with Ki values of 4.7 and 20.7 \u03bcM respectively, which, however, are much weaker than those for Zika NS2B-NS3pro here. Unfortunately, NMR spectroscopy cannot be utilized to investigate the interaction between those compounds and Zika NS2B-NS3pro as the presence of 20% glycerol significantly increased the rotational tumbling time of the protein which made NMR peaks too broad for detection.",

Strikingly, all six compounds bind to the pockets on the back of the active site of Zika NS2B-NS3pro (Fig 4A), similar to flavonoids binding to Dengue-2 NS2B-NS3pro such as Myricetin and Quercetin [32]. Interestingly in the complexes, the short \u03b2-sheet formed by NS2B residue Leu74-Leu78 and Asp83-Leu86 has direct contacts with the active site inhibitor cn-716 on one side, and with the six compounds on another side (Fig 4B and 4C). As such the pocket for binding six compounds is constituted by the surfaces provided by both Zika NS2B and NS3pro (Fig 4D and 4E), whose inner surfaces are relatively polar and negatively charged. Interestingly, five flavonoids are highly superimposable in the pocket with the phenyl ring contacting the inner wall formed by NS2B, and with the benzopyran ring located in a pocket provided by NS3pro (Fig 4E). Amazingly, although one phenyl ring of Curcumin also occupies the same pocket like flavonoids, another phenyl ring has established the binding to a new pocket of NS3pro, which is not observed for five flavonoids (Fig 4F and 4G).",

However, this hydrogen bond appears to be not very important as only a very slight reduction of the inhibitory activity was observed for Luteolin as compared to Quercetin (Table 2). However, the further absence of 3\u2019-hydroxyl group on phenyl ring in Apigenin results in loss of a hydrogen bond between 3\u2019-hydroxyl group on phenyl ring and backbone oxygen atom of Lys73 (Fig 5E). This hydrogen bond appears to be critical for its inhibitory activity as Apigenin has a Ki increased by ~25 times as compared to Luteolin (Table 2).",

In fact, Resveratrol and Curcumin have similar structures but the linker between two phenyl rings of Resveratrol is 5-carbon shorter than that of Curcumin. The complex model between Zika NS2B-NS3pro and Curcumin (Fig 5F) provides an explanation to the experimental result. With a longer linker, one phenyl ring of Curcumin occupies the pocket identical to five flavonoids with the formation of hydrogen bonds with Gln74 and Gly124, while another phenyl ring has additional contacts with a new pocket with unique hydrogen bonds with Asp122 and Ile165. As such, although Curcumin and Isorhamnetin have the same 3\u2019-methoxy and 4\u2019-hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings, likely by having bivalent binding sites, Curcumin gains an inhibitory affinity which is much higher than that of Isorhamnetin (Table 2). A high affinity, which is achieved by establishing bivalent or multivalent binding sites, has been extensively found, such as on bivalent thrombin-inhibitor interactions [49].",

            "text": "Knowledge of catalysis, structures and dynamics of all structural states is beneficial for design of inhibitors with high affinity and specificity towards enzymes including viral proteases [49\u201353]. This knowledge is particularly relevant to the flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes as it is proposed that their catalytic activities require a transition from the open (inactive) to closed (active) conformation [21,28,29,40]. Interestingly, regardless of being in the open or closed conformations, NS3pro domains of different flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes universally adopt the same chymotrypsin fold. By contrast, while the N-half of NS2B assumes a similar \u03b2-strand packed to the NS3pro domain in both open and closed conformations, the C-half of NS2B shows a significant structural diversity in different structures determined so far. In the closed conformation, NS2B structures of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes show a similar a short \u03b2-hairpin formation over the C-half of NS2B and is tightly bound to the NS3pro chymotrypsin fold (Fig 4A). However in the open conformation, the structural properties of the NS2B C-half have been shown to be quite diverse. For the well-studied Dengue-2 NS2B-NS3pro in the open conformation, most NS2B residues are tightly packed with the NS3pro domain as revealed by the crystal structure [27], and evident from its well-dispersed HSQC spectrum (S2C Fig) reconstructed from a previous report [30].",

Despite slight differences in sequence length, the catalytic parameters (Table 1) of our linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex have no significant difference from those recently published [34]. Unfortunately, as previously observed on Dengue-2 NS2B-NS3pro complexes [21,30,43], our linked Zika complex also underwent significant \u03bcs-ms dynamics, thus making its NMR signals too broad to be detected (Fig 1A and 1B). As a consequence, we devoted efforts to generate and characterize an unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex by using a protocol we previously established for the Dengue-2 NS2B-NS3pro complex [21]. This approach is also required for the selective isotope-labeling of Zika NS2B or NS3pro for high-resolution NMR studies. Indeed, despite showing no significant difference of catalytic properties from the linked one (Table 1), the unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex suddenly manifested a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled NS3pro domain in complex with unlabeled NS2B with sharper NMR peaks (Fig 1A and 1B), which are consistent with previous NMR results on the unlinked Dengue complexes [21,30,31]. Most importantly, this allowed us to selectively study the 15N-labeled NS2B in complex with unlabeled NS3pro. The results revealed that the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex, the C-terminal residues Arg73-Lys100 of NS2B remain highly disordered unlike the Dengue-2 NS2B-NS3pro complex in the open conformation. Binding to BPTI appeared to trigger the conversion of Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex into the closed conformation, in which the NS2B C-terminal residues Arg73-Ser85 become further bound to the NS3pro domain. The intrinsic dynamics of the Zika NS2B C-half might be due to the significant sequence variations over NS2B residues 91\u201396 (S3 Fig). Strikingly, this unique property for Zika NS2B-NS3pro is not only observed in solution by our NMR investigation, but has been recently shown by the crystal structure of the apo/open-form of Zika NS2B-NS3pro [43]. In the future, it is of significant interest to explore what is the functional consequence of this unique property. One possibility might be that with the intrinsically disordered NS2B C-half [44], the Zika NS2B-NS3pro is more susceptible to the allosteric regulation [50\u201352].",

Remarkably, we identified five flavonoids and one natural phenol to specifically inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro with the strongest Myricertin having a Ki of 770 nM. Recently, Lim et. al. has reported a Ki value of 8.9 uM for Myricitin [54], the difference might be due to 1) the linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro which they have used for their enzyme inhibition assay whereas we have used an unlinked enzyme and 2) the pH of the assay buffer they used is pH 7 whereas we have used pH 8.5. Furthermore, analysis of structures and inhibitory activities reveals that for flavonoids, the presence of benzopyran ring and the position to connect to phenyl ring are critical for the inhibitory activity, as evident from the results that Daidzein and Catechin were inactive on inhibiting Zika NS2B-NS3pro. Furthermore, the number of hydroxyl groups on phenyl ring is a key determinant for the inhibitory activity. Similar observation has been reported in a recent study where a number of polyphenols has been studied for inhibitory activity against linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro [54]. Interestingly, our current molecular docking reveals that these compounds bind to a pocket on the back of the active site of the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex. While five flavonoids bind very similarly to the pocket constituted by both NS2B and NS3pro, Curcumin can have an additional binding site outside of this pocket. Amazingly, the pocket we observed on the Zika NS2B-NS3pro to bind five flavonoids is very similar to that previously observed on the Dengue NS2B-NS3pro [32,48], but the additional binding site for Curcumin represents a novel one. Therefore, Zika NS2B-NS3pro appears to be highly susceptible to allosteric inhibitions, as previously found on other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes [24,32,48,53]. Noticeably, probably due to slight variations of the local geometry or/and significant difference in electrostatic potentials of the allosteric pockets of Zika and Dengue complexes, the same flavonoids inhibit the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex with higher activity [32].",

As such, our finding might help the public to fight against ZIKV infection immediately. In the further, it is also of both fundamental and therapeutic interests to characterize the allosteric mechanisms by which these natural products inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro by both experimental and computational approaches [53\u201360]. As these natural product inhibitors fundamentally differ from the currently-known active site inhibitors in both inhibitory mode and chemical scaffold [34,43], our finding may also provide a promising foundation for further development of novel allosteric inhibitors of higher affinity and specificity to fight ZIKV infection.",

The chemical structures of the compounds were downloaded from ZINC (http://zinc.docking.org) and ChemicalBook database (http://www.chemicalbook.com) respectively. Subsequently the structures were geometrically optimized with Avogadro [62]. The partial charges of all atoms in small compounds and Zika NS2B-NS3pro were assigned with Gasteiger-Marsili charges, and non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged into the appropriate heavy atoms with AutoDockTools [47]. AutoDock software (Version 4.2) was utilized to dock six compounds to the crystal structure of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. The grid box was set with 74 \u00d7 70 \u00d7 66 (x,y,z axis) with the default 0.375\u00c5 spacing. The initial population size was set to 300, and the number of energy evaluations was set to 25,000,000, and number of docking runs was set as 150. The results were clustered with each cluster having a tolerance of 2 \u00c5. The complexes with the lowest energy were selected for analysis and display.",
