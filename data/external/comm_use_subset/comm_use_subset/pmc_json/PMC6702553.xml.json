            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a major cause of economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. The most important viral agent include bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) [1]. BRSV, belonging to the genus Pneumovirus within the family Paramyxoviridae, and is one of the most important causes of lower respiratory tract infections in calves [2]; however, adult animals with subclinical infection are the main source of infection, since reinfections are common in the herds. It is highly prevalent in cattle, with a significant economic impact as the most important viral cause of BRDC worldwide [3]. BVDV is a Pestivirus from the family Flaviviridae [4], which affects the digestive, respiratory, and reproductive systems in different production animals [5]. Clinical signs include pyrexia, diarrhea, reduced production, and highly morbid disease but cause low mortality of infected animals [6]. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) is an important infectious disease of domestic and wild cattle caused by BHV-1. This virus is a member of genus Varicellovirus, which belongs to the Herpesviridae family. Clinical signs infection includes symptoms of inflammatory reactions in respiratory, genital tracts, abortion, and neurological disorders [7]. Betancur et al. [8] found a statistical association between seropositive animals for BHV-1 with respect sex and age in Colombia, while Ochoa et al. [9] reported higher infection in cows older than 5 years of age. BPI-3V is in the genus Respirovirus of the family Paramyxoviridae [10], which cause serious economic losses in small and large ruminants. Clinical disease is usually mild, with symptoms of fever, nasal discharge, and cough [11]. Betancur et al. [12] reported a statistical association between seroprevalence values for BPI-3V and age groups.",

Included animals showing clinical signs and healthy animals, belonged to the dual-purpose type, with ages between 7 months and 13 years. The following two age groups were conformed: <24 months and >24 months. Epidemiological data on potential risk factors were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the owner or manager of each herd at the time the blood samples were collected. According to this information, none of the cattle herds were vaccinated against BHV-1, BRSV, BVDV, and BPI-3. Other data gathered in the questionnaire were included in the analysis: Municipality, herd size (small: 50-200 and large: 201-500 animals), clinical signs (no and yes), age group of the animal (\u226424 and 24 months old), and to sex, i.e. male and females.

The diseased animals showed temperature ranges above 40\u00b0C and the abortions pattern was observed in any trimester of the gestation. The comparison between percent positive for the viral pathogens with the presence or absence of clinical signs is shown in Table-3. These values were analyzed by Chi-square test and according to the results obtained, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV and the most of clinical signs observed, except for abortion (p>0.05). In contrast, there was no statistical association (p>0.05) between positive percent for BHV-1, BRSV, and BPI-3V with the most of clinical signs, except for vulvovaginitis and conjunctivitis in BHV-1 and BPI-3V, respectively. All herds infected with BRSV showing similar clinical signs. In the present study, other infectious pathogens were not studied; however, the sensitivity of the ELISA test is high, which allows to estimate the seroprevalence of these viral pathogens in the dual-purpose cattle breeds.",

            "text": "BPI-3V sometimes cause severe disease as a single agent and can predispose the animal to bacterial infections of the lung [35]. Our results revealed high BPI-3V seroprevalence (47.1%) in the three explored municipalities that indicate most adult cattle have been exposed to this pathogen. These results agree with those by Carbonero et al. [14], who found high seroprevalence values in cattle of Yucatan, Mexico. However, the results obtained in this study differ with those published by Betancur et al. [12], who reported lower seroprevalence values (13.5%) in cattle from Monteria, Colombia. The high seroprevalence of BPI-3V found in this research is in agreement with the ubiquitous nature of the virus and with its worldwide distribution [36]. In this research, the seroprevalence was higher in the age group of >24 months of age (Table-4). This age group was a significant risk factor for BPI-3V transmission (OR=3.5). Possibly, due to the presence of some stress factor in these animals that favors reinfections with or without respiratory signs. In adults, especially BPI-3V, it is subclinical unless it is part of concomitant infections with other viruses and bacteria such as Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma spp., and immunosuppressive factors [37]. With regard to the clinical signs, conjunctivitis had a statistical association with the BPI-3V seroprevalence values, and regarding sex, female was a significant risk factor for BPI-3V infection (OR=3.6). This result differs with those published by Betancurt et al. [12], who found no statistical association between BPI-3V infection and sex.",

These results agree with those by Betancur et al. [8] who reported high values of seroprevalence for BHV-1 in herds of Monteria municipality, Colombia. However, these results differ with those by Ochoa et al. and [9] Guarino et al. [38], who reported 35.6% and 37% seroprevalence in cattle of Boyaca department, Colombia and Uruguay, respectively. With regard to the clinical signs, vulvovaginitis had a statistical association with the BHV-1 seroprevalence values, and sex and age were significant risk factors for the viral infection. The age wise seroprevalence to BHV-1 infection denoted that there was an increase in the occurrence of the infection as age advances, and seroprevalence was low in the young animals. In this research, it is revealed that the seroprevalence of BHV-1 in animals over 24 months of age was found to be higher than the lower age groups (<24 months). For this reason, the seroprevalence of BHV-1 in cows may reflect the proportion of BHV-1 carriers because, after a primary infection, the virus stays latent in neural ganglions that innervate genital or respiratory mucosae and maybe re-excreted on immuno-suppressive stimuli, such stress after shipment and calving [36]. With respect, the sex, the high prevalence in female might be attributed to the use of infected bulls for natural service and infected semen for artificial insemination [39]. The fact that animals were not vaccinated and that all age-groups had high seroprevalence indicates that the viral pathogens respiratory are naturally circulating in this population. So is urgently needed to establish measures for the epidemiological control and prevention of these diseases with the aim to decrease their incidence. Therefore, vaccination of animals could be considered. The distribution of virus and risk factors identification is important to establish prevention and control programs against economically important diseases such as BPI-3V, BRSV, BVDV, and BHV-1.",
