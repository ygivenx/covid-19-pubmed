Recently, the burden of atypical pathogens as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma spp. causing LRTI in children was studied in Egypt\n[12].

Moreover, the burden of a number of respiratory viruses in Middle East countries has been described in several studies\n[15-21].

Antigen detection assays such as the direct fluorescence assays (DFA) are more commonly used in clinical settings, because same-day results can be obtained. Nucleic acid-based detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the gold standard in research laboratories because they are very sensitive; however, these are cost prohibitive in many clinical settings, particularly in newly industrialized and developing nations.",

            "text": "DFA has been widely used in the clinical settings because of the high specificity and rapid results. However, DFA is not as sensitive as nucleic acid-based molecular methods. In our study, 22% of samples had a detectable virus by DFA, which is slightly lower than the 32-63% reported by other studies using an indirect immunofluorescence assay\n[28,29]. Our DFA results indicate that RSV accounted for 17.6% of all the LRTI, followed by HPIV-3 (1.8%) and HAdV (1.6%); these percentages are on the low end of the ranges reported by other studies using similar methodologies\n[21,28,29]. FLUAV contributed to 0.5% of viruses detected using DFA, while other studies reported rates of 2-15%\n[28,29]. This difference may represent a true difference in FLUAV burden between the two studies, particularly because the Tang et al. and Zhang et al. studies tested children up to 16 years of age. Other possibilities exist, such as the different sensitivities of the slightly different methods used or year-to-year variations in FLUAV prevalence. Our findings for HPIV-1 (0.9%), HPIV-2 (0%) and FLUBV (0%) using DFA were similar to another published study that reported rates of HPIV-1 (0.6%), HPIV-2 (0.1%) and FLUBV (0.2%)\n[28]. In contrast, other studies have reported higher detection levels of these three viruses, which could be due to differences in study populations, sensitivity of the assays, or sample quality. Finally, although the detection of co-infections using the immunofluorescence assay was reported\n[28,29], we did not identify any co-infections with DFA, even though we detected co-infections using other methods. The SVC system is a recently developed method using R-Mix\u2122 cells, and decreases viral detection times from 12\u201314 days for conventional methods to 24\u201372 hours\n[30]. Moreover, some studies demonstrated that the R-Mix\u2122 SVC method is more sensitive for respiratory viruses detection than conventional cell culture, and does not significantly increase laboratory virus isolation costs\n[31,32]. Our study identified a virus in 26.7% of the patients using the R-Mix\u2122 SVC, which is comparable to a Malaysian study reporting 22% positive by conventional isolation in MDCK, Vero, and Hep-2 cell lines\n[33]. Using the SVC method, RSV was the most common virus isolated, followed by HPIV-1 and HPIV-3, which is consistent with results using traditional virus isolation methods\n[33]. LaSala et al. reported that the R-Mix\u2122 system had a low sensitivity for HAdV detection\n[30] which our results also confirm (Additional files\n2). The higher FLUAV prevalence reported by the Malaysian study could be due to the different age group enrolled in the Malaysian study (0\u201324 months). In both studies, FLUBV was the least common virus among young children with LRTI. Using the SVC system, RSV was successfully isolated. However, better results might have been obtained if the samples were directly inoculated into vials without freezing and thawing, because this is particularly detrimental to the RSV infectivity.",

Most respiratory viruses are present in high titers in the respiratory tract in the first three days after symptom onset, whereas viral nucleic acid may remain for longer periods. Therefore, isolation-based methods such as SVC loose sensitivity after the first three days post-onset of symptoms, and DFA is similarly affected when viral titers decrease over the course of infection. In contrast to SVC and DFA, rt-RT-PCR remains a sensitive method for virus detection even after two weeks after symptom onset. The high sensitivity of rt-RT-PCR means it can detect a very low titer virus, or viral nucleic acid long after the virus has disappeared, making it difficult to determine if the detected virus is the primary contributor to disease. Thus, nucleic acid detection results must be interpreted with caution, particularly if the sample was taken late after symptom onset\n[37].",

One caveat of this approach is that it is unclear which virus(es) are contributing to disease. By virtue of the nucleic acid-based assay, there is no competition for detection of the various etiologies (unlike SVC) and the amplification step enables detection at lower quantities (unlike DFA). Consequently, PCR is the most useful method to detect co-infections representing near-past and current infections, because of its ability to detect very low viral titers and/or lingering nucleic acid still present later in the infection course. Several common or newly identified respiratory viruses were not assessed in this study, such as picornaviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses and newly discovered polyomaviruses, so their contribution to respiratory disease etiology and rates of co-infection in Egypt remain unknown.",
