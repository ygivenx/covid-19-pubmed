            "text": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of legal blindness in the elderly population of developed countries with over 300,000 newly diagnosed patients per year in Europe and North America [1, 2]. It is widely believed that AMD starts with the insidious, slowly progressing \u201cdry\u201d form (dry AMD) and can later develop into the more severe \u201cwet\u201d AMD, which advances very rapidly and is characterized by abnormal development of blood vessels, a process called choroidal neovascularization (CNV) [3, 4] that affects the macular region of the retina and leads to loss of central vision. In turn, dry AMD without CNV can proceed to focal loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), termed geographic atrophy (GA), which is accompanied by loss of vision over these slowly expanding areas of RPE atrophy [5]. RPE loss or dysfunction renders the surrounding tissue vulnerable to damage by reactive oxygen species and loss of photoreceptor density ensues [6]. It has been recognized that accumulation of debris below the RPE in the macula, also known as drusen, is a risk factor for AMD. Identification of complement factor proteins in drusen from AMD eyes [7], coupled with genetic variation in several complement factor genes in AMD patients [8\u201313], collectively implicates inflammation as an important component in the pathophysiology of this disease [14, 15]. For instance, it was recently demonstrated that complement factor H (CFH) serves a protective role in AMD by binding and inhibiting the inflammatory effects of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) [16]. Therefore, dissecting the initiating events of outer retinal inflammation during the early stages of AMD can lead to a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Such findings will enable the development of innovative immunotherapies that can prevent inflammatory damage to retinal tissue and loss of vision in a disease process that is estimated to increase in prevalence by 50% by the year 2020 [17].",

However, there is no effective treatment for dry AMD to date. In the pursuit of identifying the signals from the outer retina that initiate inflammation and possibly involve the immune system in AMD pathogenesis, we have evaluated immune responses to carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP), a protein modification that forms from an oxidation fragment of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [19], the most oxidizable of all long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Studies have shown that AMD donor eyes contain more CEP-modified proteins in the outer retina and drusen than in age-matched controls [7]. CEP-modified proteins and CEP autoantibodies are also more abundant in AMD plasma than in control samples [19, 20].",

Within the retina, there are two sources of macrophages: (1) microglia, bone marrow-derived resident macrophages that are recruited to neural tissue during retinal development and provide immunosurveillance in the inner retina, and (2) circulating monocytes that can be recruited from the blood vessels to sites of inflammation when needed by specific chemokines and cytokines. Independent of the source, these cells can undergo a diverse program of differentiation depending on the microenvironment that ultimately dictates their effector functions [26, 27]. Macrophages activated in the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) become proinflammatory M1 macrophages, characterized by their production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) and are associated with tissue damage. On the other hand, macrophages activated in the presence of IL-4 differentiate into M2-type, marked by production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 and involved in tissue remodeling. The CEP-MSA-induced changes in the outer retina that provide a model for AMD afford the unique opportunity to directly test the role of these cells in the disease process.",

Here we extend our original study [22] by showing that CEP-MSA immunization leads, in aged (old) BALB/c mice, to the end stage cardinal feature of human dry AMD: loss of photoreceptor cells. This major damage is the result of a low-grade but significant inflammatory response in the retina prior to overt tissue damage, which can be quantified in young mice. We have identified M1 macrophages localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) surrounding the photoreceptor outer segments in close proximity to the RPE. These changes occur in both BALB/c and B6 strains, but the kinetics are different; BALB/c mice are more susceptible at a younger age. We also detected elevated levels of the monocyte chemoattractant Ccl2 in the retinas of CEP-immunized mice. Moreover, Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 B6 mice immunized with CEP-MSA lack macrophage recruitment, and retinal lesion development is reduced or prevented. Since AMD is an age-related disease, defining the progression of inflammatory cell recruitment and development of AMD-like lesions at earlier stages of the disease is essential in order to map the character and timing of immune mechanisms that take place in our model and correlate with development of pathology. This work clarifies a long-standing question by defining a clear mechanistic path that explains the role of inflammation in AMD: M1 macrophages are key factors in dry AMD pathogenesis. We also provide experimental demonstration for the idea that regulation of immune responses (in this case, inhibition of macrophage recruitment) can be a target of therapy to prevent the development of AMD.",

Pathology scores (defined as the summation of retinal lesions and cellular infiltration) were higher in BALB/c CEP-immunized mice at both early and intermediate recovery times but only higher in B6 CEP-immunized mice at the intermediate recovery time (Figure 2(a)). To have a representative and objective pathological score throughout the retina, we focused on the number of IPM-infiltrating cells present in close proximity to the RPE. Using routine histopathology, it is not possible to distinguish different types of monocyte lineage cells present in the outer retina (for example, resident microglia versus macrophages recruited from the circulation). For this reason in the description of the results to follow, we will simply refer to the nonneural cells in the IPM as macrophages, since microglia are distinguished mainly for their location within the central nervous system. Careful examination of the lesions at these early and intermediate recovery times demonstrated that a distinct population of macrophages is present in the IPM compartment near the RPE in these animals. Quantification in plastic sections showed that CEP-immunized BALB/c mice have a significantly higher number of macrophages than age-matched na\u00efve animals harvested at 40\u2013100 days p.i. (P = 0.023) as well as those harvested at 100\u2013200 days p.i. (P = 0.023) (Figure 2(b)). The same cellular quantification is observed with H&E staining of frozen sections (Figure 2(c)). When comparing IPM macrophages between the two time points, BALB/c mice showed an increase in the number of these cells in the early to intermediate recovery times in both immunized and na\u00efve mice, but the magnitude was significantly higher in immunized mice (P = 0.012). While CEP-immunized B6 mice harvested at early recovery times showed no significant differences in IPM macrophages when compared to na\u00efve B6 mice, immunized mice harvested at intermediate time points had more IPM macrophages than age-matched B6 na\u00efve controls (P = 0.023). Therefore, the number of monocyte-lineage cells present in the IPM increases over time in CEP-immunized B6 mice to reach significant numbers by the intermediate recovery times.",

This difference is also evident in the number of RPE lesions, which are higher in BALB/c mice than in B6 mice, regardless of immunization status. To test the possibility that photosensitivity in the BALB/c albino mice [28] could be responsible for the differences in outer retinal lesion development and macrophage presence when compared to B6 mice, we immunized albino B6 mice (B6(Cg)-Tyr\nc\u22122J/J or Tyr\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack the tyrosinase enzyme) and compared them to age-matched na\u00efve Tyr\n\u2212/\u2212 mice as well as to corresponding BALB/c and WT-B6-immunized and na\u00efve mice at 40\u201390 days p.i. The results from these comparisons showed that both macrophages in the outer retina and development of retinal lesions observed in Tyr\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are comparable to WT B6 and do not show the enhanced cellular recruitment, RPE hypertrophy, and ROS vacuolization present in BALB/c mice at the early time points, regardless of immunization status (Figure 3(a)). Quantification analysis of pathological changes per section supports these observations (Figure 3(b)). This suggests that the differences in inflammatory cells present in the outer retina and AMD-like pathology observed between the BALB/c and the B6 strains are not due to photosensitivity in the albino mice because of lack of pigmentation, but instead they are specific to genetic background, possibly due to differences in the immune responses against CEP-MSA between the mice or to inherent differences in RPE function and/or local oxidative damage responses in the retina.",

We were able to localize a significant number of these macrophages in the RPE and IPM using nuclear counterstaining with DAPI (Figure 4(a), Supplementary Figure 3). This correlates with the location of the macrophages identified by histopathology using toluidine blue and H&E staining that are mostly observed in proximity with vacuolization and lesions of RPE and photoreceptors. In order to determine the specific class and activation status of these macrophages, we performed intracellular stains for Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and Interleukin-12 (IL-12) production, which identify M1 macrophages, versus IL-10 production, a hallmark of M2 macrophage differentiation. We observed both TNF+ and IL-12+ cells within the IPM of CEP-MSA-immunized mice, but IL-10 staining was negative, indicating the presence of activated M1 macrophages in the pathological regions of immunized mice only (Figure 4(b)). To substantiate the IHC results, we performed mRNA quantification on IPM-infiltrating macrophages isolated by laser capture. These data confirmed that detectable levels of M1 marker genes (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2) were observed only in CEP-immunized mice, whereas IL-10 expression was not detected (Figure 4(c)). Expression of Arg1, another M2 marker, was not elevated in CEP-immunized mice. Interestingly, we also observed CEP-associated increased expression of Ccl2, a monocyte chemoattractant that has been implicated in AMD, suggesting that the Ccl2/Ccr2 axis may play a role in CEP-induced pathology. These data strongly suggest that M1 macrophages are primarily associated with the lesions we observe in the outer retina and may be the main effectors of the inflammatory response observed in this model.",

Notably, our data suggest that BALB/c mice tend to be more sensitive to immunization with CEP-MSA than B6 mice by having a greater magnitude and earlier significant difference of inflammatory cells in the IPM when compared to age-matched controls. In addition, dry AMD-like pathology, such as RPE cell hypertrophy, vacuolization of RPE and ROS, and RPE cell pyknosis, is also found at greater magnitude and arises earlier following immunization in the BALB/c mice. We also show that old CEP-immunized BALB/c mice develop photoreceptor cell loss.

Furthermore, our data showed no statistically significant differences between the two strains through time. This suggests that any age-related changes seen in immunized mice observed during the early stages of disease are of comparable magnitude regardless of strain, but that the higher number of macrophages present in the IPM of BALB/c mice makes it technically easier for quantification of disease onset. In other words, the reason that there seems to be no early differences in na\u00efve versus CEP-MSA mice on the B6 background is because the actual number of IPM-infiltrating cells is too low at that point to achieve statistical significance.

B6 mice are prone to develop T helper type 1 (Th1) responses, whereas BALB/c are Th2-prone. On the other hand, it has been shown that melanin in the RPE provides protection from light damage [30]. By showing that albino B6 (Tyr\n\u2212/\u2212) mice have comparable inflammatory cell numbers in the IPM and AMD-like pathology with WT B6 mice in a much less robust form than BALB/c mice, the possibility that light damage largely contributes to pathology is less likely. Indeed, it has been previously shown that B6 (Tyr\n\u2212/\u2212) are not vulnerable to light damage [31]. Therefore, we believe that at least one major reason for the observed kinetic and quantitative differences is the number of inflammatory cells in the outer retinas of BALB/c mice. Whether there are significant differences in endogenous CEP levels in the retinas of these mice, inherent differences in RPE function and/or local oxidative damage responses in the retina, or the particular contribution of specific adaptive immunity pathways, is an aspect under current investigation in our laboratory.",

A further complication involves the two different forms of AMD: macrophages could have different roles in dry versus wet AMD.

Missing from the first study and addressed in this paper are three key parameters that now lead to the interpretation that there is a causal relationship between M1 macrophages and dry AMD-like pathology: (i) kinetics and magnitude (quantification) of macrophage infiltration into the IPM relative to lesion development; (ii) activation status of the observed macrophages; (iii) how are the cells being recruited? This current study provides evidence for the first time that the early involvement of M1 macrophages occurs in animals that are predisposed to develop retinal lesions. We also provide the mechanism for recruitment of these cells, as Ccl2 is elevated in retinas of CEP-immunized mice, and its receptor, Ccr2, is required for macrophage infiltration into the IPM.",

Furthermore, this model relies on the endogenous accumulation of CEP adducts in the outer retina, which should occur at equivalent rates in immunized versus na\u00efve mice, allowing resident microglia an equal access to the CEP antigen.

[32, 34] has challenged this notion, at least for Ccl2\u2212/\u2212 mice. A major difference between these other studies and ours is that our model allows us to focus on the evaluation of relatively young animals following immunization with CEP-MSA, in contrast to the retinal lesions described previously that develop in the older knockout animals; we analyzed mice before 12 months of age, the na\u00efve Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice develop retinal pathology after 18\u201320 months. Therefore, it would be difficult to make a direct comparison with our study, but it provides the opportunity to explore new mechanisms that link immunity to AMD. Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice do not lack ocular macrophages, just defective (or delayed) age-related recruitment (to the choroid). In fact, as shown by Luhmann et al. 2009 [32], \u201cold\u201d Ccl2\u2212/\u2212 mice (which closely resemble the Ccr2 macrophage phenotype) have increased macrophage recruitment to the subretinal space (the same area in which we observe macrophage infiltration in CEP-MSA mice) when compared to wild type, showing that a defective Ccl2/Ccr2 axis does not necessarily, by itself, preclude retinal infiltration of macrophages. While there is certainly a possibility that the observed pathology in CEP-immunized WT mice may not be due to macrophages, we think the Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 data in this paper answers that question: if macrophages did not play a detrimental role in our model (if the retinal lesions in CEP-MSA mice were macrophage independent) then we should have observed some pathology in the immunized Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice, which we did not. Because the Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice still develop CEP antibodies similar to WT (indicative of an effective adaptive immune response), the M1 phenotype of subretinal macrophages as well as the temporal relationship between macrophage infiltration and retinal lesions (macrophage recruitment precedes lesion development), we believe that our interpretation that macrophages are detrimental in our model is justified.",

We believe that our data is representative of the role of early M1 macrophages and provides a nice platform to study early events in the development of AMD. This does not exclude the idea that later cellular involvement may include M2 macrophages that could be important for resolution of disease, suggested in the published studies looking at aged Ccr2/Ccl2 knockout mice [29, 32]. In fact, it was recently shown in a retinal neuropathy injury model that IL-10-producing (M2) macrophages have a protective role [38]. The balance between M1 and M2 at different ages may actually dictate the damaged versus repaired tissue status of the retina. To support this notion, a recent paper analyzing human AMD eyes showed that AMD correlated with increased M1/M2 ratios, whereas normal aging eyes had more M2 macrophages [39].

Anti-CEP antibody titers at days 40\u201360 p.i. were quantified by ELISA as previously described [22] and used to determine efficiency of immunization. All immunized mice were compared with age-matched na\u00efve, sham-MSA, or CFA controls. There are no significant differences among the control mice (with low to undetectable anti-CEP titers) in terms of retinal pathology and are therefore used interchangeably, depending on experimental setup.
