            "text": "Pomegranates (Punica granatum L.) have a long history of antibacterial use dating back to biblical times. Egyptians used pomegranates to treat a number of different infections [1]. It was utilized as a traditional remedy for thousands of years under the Ayurvedic system of medicine, with extracts from the rind of the fruit and bark of the tree being effective against diarrhea and dysentery [2]. Over the years there have been many small studies undertaken in different areas of the world on the bactericidal effects of pomegranates on a number of highly pathogenic and drug-resistant strains. These studies normally determine bactericidal potency of different extracts of the pomegranate plant against a range of different bacteria, utilizing disc diffusion assays or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Methanol extracts of the fruit, especially the peel, exhibit the broadest antibacterial activity [3\u20138] (Table 1), which can vary depending on the pomegranate variety tested [9]. Methanol extracts of pomegranate are high in hydrolyzable tannins (punicalins and punicalagins), ellagic acid, a component of ellagitannins, and gallic acid, a component of gallotannins [10] (Figure 1). Mass spectrometry data shows that pomegranate contains oligomeric ellagitannin with a degree of polymerization of up to 5 core glucose units [11]. These molecules may be the most potent antibacterial compounds in pomegranate. However, other compounds also have activity and may contribute synergistically as mixtures to bring about the effects, including anthocyanins (pelargonidin-3-galactose and cyanidin-3-glucose) and flavonols (quercetin and myricetin) [8].

These infections can be life-threatening to young children and the elderly. There is an incentive to find alternative control measures, such as plant and herbal extracts, especially in lesser-developed countries where traditional antibiotics may not be readily available. In Thailand, a study was undertaken in which extracts of pomegranate were tested for their antibacterial activity against different strains of E. coli, including 3 strains of E. coli O157:H7 [12]. Growth inhibition zones, using the agar disc diffusion method, ranged from 7 to 17 mm. An aqueous extract of pomegranate was highly effective against E. coli O157:H7 with MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of 0.19 and 0.39 mg/mL, respectively. In another Thai study, an ethanolic extract of pomegranate had MICs of 0.49 to 1.95 mg/mL and MBCs of 1.95 to 3.91 mg/mL against E. coli O157:H7 [13]. This extract exhibited both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities, indicating that it may be an effective adjunct treatment for E. coli O157:H7 infection. ",

Typhi) is a life-threatening enteric infection that can be transmitted by consuming food or drinking water contaminated with feces from an infected person. It is more common in less industrialized countries. Extracts of pomegranate fruit pericarp were tested by agar well diffusion and found to be highly active when compared to a reference concentration-response curve for ampicillin [14]. In another study which screened plants of importance in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, strong antibacterial activity was exhibited by the methanol extracts of pomegranate [15]. V. cholerae, the cause of cholera infections, is most commonly acquired from feces-infected drinking water. In one study examining bactericidal activity of plants used by Peruvian people to combat cholera, pomegranate peel extract and tea infusions were effective [17]. Shigella spp. are an important cause of diarrhea and dysentery in the Mexican population. In one study, ethanolic pomegranate extracts exhibited greater antibacterial activity than the antibiotic chloramphenicol, but lower activity than trimethoprim [18]. Shigella sonnei showed the highest susceptibility to the extracts.",

            "text": "Pomegranate extract was evaluated in several studies for the ability to decontaminate meat surfaces and maintain food quality. A pomegranate peel extract at 250 \u03bcg/mL was most effective at inhibiting antibiotic resistant strains of Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) on meat surfaces and improved sensory evaluations of quality [21]. In another study, dipping raw chicken breasts in 0.02% pomegranate fruit juice solution reduced protein oxidation, inhibited microbial growth, and increased sensory acceptability for up to 12 days of refrigerated storage at 4\u00b0C [22]. Dried pomegranate juice powder was heated to 100 degrees C for 0, 30, 60, or 120 minutes and added at 2% (wt/wt) to ground top round beef to determine if heat would alter the antilisterial activity of the powder [20]. The meat was then cooked and inoculated with individual L. monocytogenes strains. Samples of meat stored at 5\u00b0C were taken at days 1, 8, 14, and 21 and plated on media for evaluation of bacterial growth. All the heat-treated pomegranate juice powder treatments significantly inhibited growth of all five L. monocytogenes strains in refrigerated ground cooked beef by 1.80 to 4.61 log CFU/g at day 21, suggesting that heating does not impact the antilisterial activity of pomegranate. In another study, an 80% methanolic pomegranate peel extract resulted in a >1 log(10) reduction of L. monocytogenes in fish during storage at 4\u00b0C [7]. One study examined the effectiveness of pomegranate peel to inhibit growth of L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and Salmonella enterica in cheese at room temperature (~23\u00b0C) [19]. The pomegranate treatment increased the stability of cheese against lipid oxidation, improving shelf life. A pomegranate sour sauce had an antimicrobial effect when mixed with lettuce, spring onion, and parsley, either inoculated with S. aureus and E. coli O157:H7 or containing the naturally existing bacterial flora [23].",

Pomegranate peel (5% methanolic extract) prepared as an ointment was applied to guinea pig wounds daily for 12 days [27]. The treatment significantly enhanced wound healing by increasing collagen, DNA and protein synthesis as well as contraction rate and tensile strength. The extract exhibited significant antibacterial activity against wound bacteria, including strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Salmonella Anatum, S. Typhimurium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. There were no toxic effects noted from use of the skin ointment. Another study using the methanolic extract of pomegranate peels formulated into a 10% (wt/wt) water-soluble gel showed similar enhancements in wound healing in a Wistar rat model compared to a commercial topical antibacterial product [44]. The group treated with 5.0% gel had a 59.5% increase in contraction of the skin, a 2-fold increase in collagen content, and positive microscopic changes to the skin. Participant's wounds were completely healed after 10 days, compared to 16\u201318 days for the group receiving a blank control gel. The activity was postulated to be due to the high phenolic content (44%) in the peel extract. ",

Extract concentrations of 8 mg/mL and 12 mg/mL were effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans, and S. salivarius. The extract did not inhibit Actinomyces viscosus. In another similar in vitro study, ethanol and water extracts of pomegranate both had inhibitory effects against S. mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) [32]. A Brazilian in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial effect of a pomegranate-based oral gel (made from an extract of dried peel combined with Carbopol, water, and triethanolamine) against Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, and S. mutans [31]. The MICs required to inhibit adherence of the bacteria to glass were assessed using increasing and doubled concentrations of the diluted solution of the pomegranate gel at concentrations ranging from 1 : 1 to 1 : 1024. The MICs of adherence of pomegranate gel against the bacteria were 1 : 16 for S. mutans and S. sanguis and 1 : 128 for S. mitis. These results suggest that pomegranate gel might be useful in the control of adherence of different bacteria in the oral cavity. In other in vitro studies, pomegranate extract also inhibited strains of periodontal bacteria, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia [33], Klebsiella, E. coli, and Proteus spp. [34].

In one trial, the amount of plaque accumulation was measured at days 0 and 5 in thirty periodontally healthy volunteers who refrained from all mechanical oral hygiene measures for 4 days and instead used either pomegranate extract, chlorhexidine, or a placebo rinse twice daily [33]. At day 5, those volunteers using the pomegranate extract had significantly less plaque buildup (P < 0.05) than those using the placebo rinse. The pomegranate extract prevented as much plaque as the chlorhexidine rinse. These results on pomegranate's effect on plaque reduction are supported by another human trial in which pomegranate extract rinse was compared to chlorhexidine and placebo rinse [34]. After 24 hours without tooth brushing, plaque samples were taken from sixty healthy, younger patients between the ages of 9 and 25 who wore orthodontic appliances. Dental plaque samples were plated on media for 48 hours, and the number of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) showed that the pomegranate extract rinse was effective against dental plaque microorganisms, decreasing the CFU/mL by 84%, similar to chlorhexidine (79% inhibition), and significantly different from the control rinse (11% inhibition). Authors speculated that the ellagitannin and punicalagin may be responsible for the antibacterial activity of the pomegranate extract rinse. ",

If left untreated, gingivitis may progress to periodontal disease and subsequent tooth loss. There is an incentive to use alternative plant-based preparations as an adjunctive to mechanical therapy in the prevention and treatment of gingivitis, due to the health risks imposed by long-term use of chemical and pharmaceutical preparations and the lack of available dental care in lesser-developed countries. Results of a randomized clinical study of 40 patients with chronic gingivitis showed that significant improvements were obtained in the group that used a pomegranate extract gel along with mechanical debridement for 7 days when compared with patients using only control gel or mechanical debridement for the 7-day test period [45]. Another placebo-controlled human clinical trial of 32 young adults examined salivary measures relevant to oral health and gingivitis after using a pomegranate extract mouth rinse three times per day for 4 weeks or a placebo rinse [46]. Compared to the control group, those participants using the pomegranate rinse had reduced total protein associated with presence of plaque-forming bacteria, reduced activities related to cell injury, reduced levels of the sucrose-degrading enzyme alpha-glucosidase, and increased activity of the enzyme ceruloplasmin, which protects against oral oxidative stress. Based on these results, the authors suggest the possibility of using pomegranate extracts in oral health products such as toothpaste and mouthwashes.",

Human noroviruses (HNoVs) belong to the family of Caliciviridae, being nonenveloped and round in shape with a diameter of 27 to 40 nm. There are currently five genogroups based on nucleic acid sequence analysis, of which primarily genogroup I and frequently genogroups II and IV are associated with human norovirus outbreaks. Earlier studies indicated that HNoVs are estimated to be solely responsible for up to 2.3 million infections, 50,000 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths per year in the US alone [69]. ",

HNoVs can be transmitted from person to person, through food, aerosols, water, and contact with fomites [74]. They are reported to have a low infectious dose of 10 to 100 viral particles with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever.

However, newly emergent strains (such as genogroup II.4) have become highly virulent and life-threatening especially to the elderly and immunocompromised [68].

            "text": "The effectiveness of natural remedies such as pomegranate juice and extracts as alternatives for the treatment or prevention of foodborne norovirus infections needs to be explored more aggressively. Recently, pomegranate juice and polyphenols were shown to have significant antiviral effects against foodborne viral surrogates, FCV-F9, MNV-1, and bacteriophage MS2 [75]. These researchers showed that the juice could decrease low titers (~5 log10 PFU/mL) of FCV-F9, MNV-1, and MS2 by 2.56, 1.32, and 0.32 log10 PFU/mL, respectively, after 1 hour at room temperature and high titers (~7 log10 PFU/mL) by 1.20, 0.06, and 0.63 log10 PFU/mL. The most potent effect was on FCV-F9 after treatment with 8, 16, or 32 mg/mL of pomegranate polyphenol (extracted from fresh pomegranate fruit-POM obtained from POM Wonderful). After 1 hour at room temperature, low and high titers of FCV-F9 were completely undetectable. Following 1-hour incubation with 4, 8, or 16 mg/mL pomegranate polyphenol, low initial titers of MNV-1 were reduced by 1.30, 2.11, and 3.61 log10 PFU/mL and high initial titers by 1.56, 1.48, and 1.54 log10 PFU/mL, respectively. The titer reduction effect of pomegranate against MNV-1 is notable in that this surrogate is considered to be more appropriate than FCV-F9 by some researchers. Bacteriophage MS2 at low initial titers was reduced by 0.41, 0.45, and 0.93 log10 PFU/mL and at high initial titers by 0.32, 0.41, and 0.72 log10 PFU/mL after incubation with 4, 8, or 16 mg/mL of pomegranate polyphenol, respectively. Overall effectiveness of pomegranate on reduction of virus titer rankings was FCV-F9 > MNV-1 > MS2 for the tested low-titer viruses (5 log10 PFU/mL), while for the high-titer viruses (7 log10 PFU/mL), the effectiveness rankings were FCV-F9 > MS2 > MNV-1 [75]. Pomegranate juice contains total phenolics of 3.6 mg/mL [55]; therefore, pomegranate polyphenols were tested at a similar concentration (4 mg/mL) and exhibited consistently greater antiviral effects than that of pomegranate juice against all viruses at both high and low titers [75]. This difference may be due to variability in composition and bioavailability of polyphenols in juice versus those extracted in pure form. In addition, the antiviral effects are not pH-dependent, as no differences in bioactivity were noted when juice pH was changed from 3.4 to 7.0. Given that MNV-1 is quite resistant to most treatment conditions, including pH and heat [73], but inhibited by pomegranate juice and its polyphenols, it is possible that additional research will reveal a role for pomegranate as a natural alternative for treating and/or preventing human norovirus infections.

There were no significant differences in titer reductions when comparing different brands of commercial pomegranate juice; however, titer reduction levels were affected by different storage times.

HBGAs are complex carbohydrates present on red blood cell surfaces, the mucosal epithelium of respiratory, genitourinary, and digestive tracts and as free oligosaccharides in saliva, intestinal contents, milk, and blood.

Influenza virus continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality each year with 31,000 deaths reported yearly in the US, despite access to vaccines [52]. However, frequent recombination events and viral evolution necessitate the change in vaccine composition requiring administration of new vaccines yearly. Researchers have shown that pomegranate polyphenols were virucidal against influenza A virus, suppressed the replication of the virus in host cells, and inhibited agglutination of chicken red blood cells caused by the virus using real-time polymerase chain reaction, a plaque assay, and a median tissue culture infective dose 50% hemagglutination assay [52]. They also showed that among four polyphenols (ellagic acid, caffeic acid, luteolin, and punicalagin), punicalagin was found to be the most effective anti-influenza component, blocking replication of influenza virus RNA and inhibiting agglutination of chicken red blood cells by the virus.

            "text": "Sundararajan et al. [78] also showed that the acidity of pomegranate juice and concentrated liquid pomegranate extract (POMxl) solutions contributed to rapid anti-influenza activity, whereas pomegranate polyphenol (PP) powder (POMxp) did not. A 5-minute treatment at room temperature with 800 \u03bcg/mL PP was shown to result in at least a 3 log titer reduction of influenza viruses PR8 (H1N1), X31 (H3N2), and a reassortant H5N1 virus derived from a human isolate. Loss of hemagglutinating activity was reported to accompany the loss of influenza infectivity, with decreased antibody binding to viral surface molecules after treatments with PP. Viral structural damage was also reported using electron microscopic analysis of PP-treated viral particles. However, they found that the antiviral activity was less against avian isolates of one coronavirus and reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses. Kotwal [54] suggested that pomegranate juice can neutralize the infectivity of diverse enveloped viruses and a number of subtypes of a given enveloped virus, indicating potential for development as a treatment option that can be broadly effective against pandemic viruses like HIV, potentially pandemic viruses like influenza, and some carcinogenic viruses. It was shown that influenza A/HK/x31(H3N2), influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), and a reassortant x31 containing the NS gene segment of an H5N1 isolate were inactivated when treated for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C with pomegranate juice [54].",

One study found that proanthocyanidin A-1 inhibited viral attachment and penetration and affected the late stages of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection [80]. Liu et al. [81] determined that the inhibitory effect of tea polyphenols is through multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease activity, blocking gp120-CD4 interaction by binding to cellular CD4 molecules, and destroying viral particles. Further studies are needed to identify additional antiviral mechanisms of action associated with pomegranate and its constituents. ",

            "text": "There are a number of studies on pomegranate and their antimicrobial activities against bacteria and viruses, with mechanisms of actions including pH-independent bacterial and viral growth inhibition, effects on bacterial cell signaling, reductions in viral infectivity and binding to host cell receptors, and structural damage to viruses. However, many of the study results are based on in vitro and cell-based assays. Therefore, the applicability of the results to human health is mainly focused on diseases and infections that occur topically, such as those in the oral cavity or on the skin surface. It is difficult to extrapolate in vivo effects on infection from in vitro results using unmetabolized pomegranate juice or compounds on microbes. In addition, it is difficult to compare results of studies that do not standardize the treatment extracts for the active components. Standard procedures should be adopted by the pomegranate industry that utilize the same quantification methods. A method for determining ellagitannin levels using a novel pomegranate standard has been published, which could be helpful in addressing this issue [82, 83]. The current studies do support potential benefit of pomegranate extracts in food preservation and decontamination. This application could be particularly useful in lesser-developed countries where food sanitation can easily be compromised. Results of the studies on antibacterial benefits of pomegranate extracts against dental bacteria and infections hold promise because they are clinically-based. Additional larger-scale trials should be conducted to confirm the benefits. ",
