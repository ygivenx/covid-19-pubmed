            "text": "Increasing robustness by improving resistance/tolerance to pathogens is an important selection objective in most livestock species, particularly in pigs. In the past 30 years, selection for growth, carcass leanness, meat quality and prolificacy, combined with stringent sanitary rules, vaccination and use of antibiotics, has been highly effective in pigs [1]. Since the early 2000's, prophylactic use of antibiotics as growth promoters has been forbidden by European legislation. As a result, the health status of numerous farms has deteriorated, leading to an increase in the therapeutic use of antibiotics. Indeed, animals highly selected for production traits may be more susceptible to pathogens or less able to maintain performance after infection. Deterioration of the global health status may also be due to environmental trends. In this context, including health traits in existing breeding schemes using direct and/or indirect strategies is an emerging trend in pig breeding. Direct strategies target animal resistance/tolerance to specific pathogens but may result in increased susceptibility to other diseases [2], [3]. Alternatively, an indirect and putatively more global approach focuses on immune traits (ITs) providing a measure of immune capacity (i.e. immunocompetence) and hopefully predicting the responses to pathogens in general [4].",

This highly interactive and cooperative system is classically separated into two arms referred to as innate and adaptive, which produce a combined response. Innate immunity is the first line of defence. Its activation is non pathogen-specific and depends on the recognition of evolutionarily conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharides constituting bacterial cell walls [5]. Innate immunity involves physical barriers, innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, natural killers (NK cells) or \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes, and inflammatory cytokines such as IL1B, IL6 and TNF. Adaptive immunity is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific \u201cnon-self\u201d antigens via a process of antigen presentation and results in an immunological memory. Adaptive immunity is divided into cell- and humoral-mediated immunity with different effector functions [6].",

            "text": "In order to include ITs in a breeding plan to improve pig immunocompetence, the genetic and phenotypic parameters of the different ITs need first to be estimated. Several studies in swine, mice, poultry and cattle demonstrated the possibility of selecting animals with high or low immune response (IR) as characterized by one or a few ITs [2], [7], [8], [9], [10]. A study on Yorkshire pigs selected for eight generations for high and low adaptive IR (HIR and LIR, respectively) on an index combining four standardized measures of specific antibodies and cell-mediated IR, after stimulation with specific antigens (bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin and hen egg white lysozyme), has revealed that HIR and LIR animals differ in response to immunization and infection [2], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Other studies have also shown that various innate and adaptive ITs are genetically controlled. For example, variation in innate ITs, such as NK cells, monocytes, interferon \u03b1 (IFN\u03b1) production or phagocytosis [15], [16], [17] is heritable and several adaptive ITs have moderate to high heritability values including total white blood cells (WBC), CD4+ T lymphocyte, CD8\u03b1+ T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte subsets [15], [16], [17], delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction [15], [18], lymphocyte proliferative response [15], interleukin-2 (IL2) production by lymphocytes [15] and antibody response [12], [15], [18], [19]. Clapperton and colleagues have also reported that variation in acute phase protein levels is heritable [16], [17]. Finally, several significant QTLs for total leukocyte count ([20], [21]; AnimalQTLdb, http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/index), mitogen-induced proliferation [20], antibody response [20], [22], cytokine production (IL10 and IFN\u03b3) [23], complement activity [22], and acute phase protein serum concentration [22] have been detected and mapped to different pig chromosomes. Taken together these data demonstrate that variation in some ITs is under genetic control. However, most of the results reported so far have targeted a limited number of traits and very few studies have combined innate and adaptive ITs.",

For cell-mediated adaptive IR, we included only those traits related to cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation after PMA-ionomycin stimulation. For innate ITs, we included 10 FACS-characterized cell subtypes including the percentages of B lymphocytes (IgM+), \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes (TCR\u03b3\u03b4+), three subsets of \u03b1\u03b2 T lymphocytes (CD4+ CD8+, CD4- CD8+ and CD4+ CD8-), NK cells (CD16+ CD2+) and three monocyte subsets (CD16+ CD172A+, CD16+ MHCII+, MHCII+ CD172A+). We excluded from the analysis four haematological traits not directly involved in immunity: red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (HT), red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and platelet count (PLT). The percentage of variance (inertia) explained by the first five components was over 50% (Figure 2A). Each of these five components explained more than 5% of the total variance and the first two components accounted for 16.4 and 10.8% of the total variance, respectively. Taking into account the 32 components from PCA, multivariate normal mixture modelling and model-based clustering (see Materials and Methods) were used to identify clusters of ITs. The highest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was obtained using the diagonal model with variable shape and variable variance (VVI in pink on Figure 2B) and K = 3 (first factorial plan on Figure 2C). No parameter was located near the correlation circle indicating that the phenotypic correlations between ITs are globally weak. A first cluster (K1 in blue on Figure 2C) groups together four hemogram\u2013derived cell counts: white blood cell count (WBC), lymphocyte count (LYM), monocyte count (MON) and neutrophil count (NEU). This cluster is representative of total cell number traits despite the eosinophil count (EOS) not being included. A second cluster (K2 in green on Figure 2C) groups together all the traits related to FACS-characterized leukocyte subpopulations (expressed as the percentage of cells with one or two surface antigens) except \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes (TCR\u03b3\u03b4+), with a cell response parameter (IL10-PMAIONO) and the seric level of haptoglobin (HAPT). This cluster can be considered as representative of the leukocyte subsets. A third cluster (K3 in red on Figure 2C) includes all other cell response traits, one hemogram-derived cell count (EOS) and one FACS-characterized leukocyte subpopulation. Note that K1 and K2 related traits, which mainly correspond to cell subsets and explain around 25% of the phenotypic variance, show clear clustering (Figure 2C). These traits are grouped on the first PCA axis and separated on the second axis. Traits belonging to K3, representative of cell activity (cytokine production, phagocytosis and antibody production), are more spread out on the other axes (data not shown). Interestingly, cluster analysis did not highlight any cluster of innate or adaptive ITs.",

Proliferation measurements after various stimulations (PROLIF-CONA, PROLIF-PMAIONO, PROLIF-LPS) provided moderate estimates of heritability not significantly different from zero. Among the traits involved in humoral-mediated adaptive immunity, heritabilities for total IgG and IgA antibody levels were higher than for total IgM and specific antibodies, and weak  values were obtained for B lymphocyte count (IgM+ cells).",

            "text": "The large-scale study reported here allowed us to estimate the genetic and phenotypic parameters of numerous ITs measured on pigs bred in the same environment. Innate immunity is represented by 25 traits, humoral-mediated immunity by five traits and cell-mediated adaptive immunity by 18 traits. We have also considered the total number of white blood cells and lymphocytes, and four other haematological traits (RBC, HT, RDW and PLT). Within cell-mediated immunity, we explored both Th1 and Th2 responses by measuring cytokine production. Figure 1 summarizes the traits that we selected to cover immunity globally. These traits include in vivo measures on blood such as quantification of cell populations by hemogram, dosage of circulating immunoglobulins and acute phase proteins, as well as ex vivo measures obtained after in vitro tests such as lymphocyte proliferation, phagocytosis capacity and cytokine production after blood stimulation. All these ITs have been widely studied in humans [25], [26]. The trait typology we have used (Table 1) follows a model based on a clear distinction between innate and adaptive immunity, which may be over-simplistic since both immune systems are closely interconnected [27], [28]. Monocytes are involved in innate immunity but are also antigen-presenting cells required for adaptive immunity, and cytokines such as IL12 are at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity. Similarly, the cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immunity subdivision is artificial. For example, IL4 is a cytokine produced by Th2 lymphocytes that is usually classified as part of adaptive cell-mediated immunity, whereas it is also involved in antibody production and thus adaptive humoral immunity. In addition, the conventional paradigm that CD4+ \u03b1\u03b2 T lymphocytes differentiate into Th1 and Th2 lineages expressing specific cytokines is collapsing. Indeed, recent studies have revealed that cytokine production by the different CD4+ T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th, Th17 and iTreg) is highly flexible, providing new insight into the Th cell plasticity [29]. Nevertheless, although schematic, the approach used in our report provides a comprehensive overview of genetic variation and co-variation across the entire immune spectrum in pigs (Figure 1).",

            "text": "\nTable 1 illustrates various ranges of phenotypic variation in the measured immune traits, with most having a CV over 0.5. Such variability has already been reported in large panels of healthy humans [26], and in previous studies on pigs [2], [16], [17], [30]. For instance, we substantiated the high level of variation of cytokine production previously reported for IL2 production and virus-induced IFN\u03b1 production in a Swedish Yorkshire population [20]. For innate immunity-related cytokines and IL12, stimulation was performed with a mixture of LPS, PMA and ionomycin. IL8 was the cytokine produced with the highest levels followed by IL1B, TNF, IL12 and lastly IL6. These four cytokines are not expected to be expressed at similar levels at all time points after stimulation and a kinetic study would help to improve comparison of cytokine production levels. Weaker levels of adaptive IR cytokines are observed after LPS stimulation compared to CONA or PMAIONO. These differences could be related to the distinct modes of action of these molecules. Indeed, PMA, a plant-derived functional analog of diacylglycerol, in conjunction with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore produced by Streptomyces conglobatus, and CONA, a lectin originally extracted from the jack-bean Canavalia ensiformis, are known to be potent mitogens of blood lymphocytes [31], [32]. LPS, a major structural component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, which binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex and promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, has been extensively used to study innate immune response [33]. We have already shown that transcriptome modifications in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) differ between PMAIONO and LPS stimulation and that PMAIONO and LPS target different cells and cellular pathways [34]. The combination of PMA and ionomycin induces a stronger stimulation that may be related to a higher production of cytokines as detected in the present study. In addition, the lymphocyte proliferation induced by LPS is weaker than that observed with other stimulants, as expected.",

Pro-inflammatory cytokines appear to show less heritable variation than adaptive system-related cytokines. Among the adaptive system-related cytokines, estimated heritability was weakest for cytokines produced after LPS stimulation, except for IL2 production. Heritability estimates for lymphocyte proliferation after CONA, PMA and LPS stimulations were moderate and that of lymphocyte proliferation after CONA stimulation was comparable to the value obtained by Edfors-Lilja and colleagues [15]. Moderate to high heritability estimates for cell count traits from hemogram or FACS also confirmed those previously obtained for WBC, total lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and some leukocyte subsets (for CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes, CD11R1+, CD11R1+ CD8\u03b1-, CD11R1+ CD8\u03b1+ and CD16+ MHCII+) [15], [16], [17], [19]. Likewise, our results confirmed the high heritability estimate for phagocytosis [15]. Conversly, a lower heritability estimate for CRP than previously reported was observed [15], [16]. Overall, the heritability estimates for these traits appear robust regardless of populations, environments and protocols.",

Our estimated heritability for total IgG is higher (0.92,   = 0.20) than in published reports [3], [15], [18], [19]. In addition, our estimated h2 for IFN\u03b1 production is moderate to high (0.60,   = 0.23), contrary to previous results (range from 0 to 0.08) [15], and for haptoglobin (0.55,   = 0.21) is higher than previously published (range from 0.14 to 0.23) [17], [19]. These discrepancies could be due to differences in the pig breeds and in environment factors but also to the absence of common standardised protocols between laboratories. In order to better qualify the phenotypes, protocol standardisation is needed.",

PCA results and correlation estimations highlight the weak phenotypic and genetic correlations between the different ITs, except mainly for cell subsets. No cluster of innate and adaptive ITs is revealed. These results illustrate that many of the ITs included in our study provide more or less independent potential clues for selecting for improved immunocompetence. Such complementarity is expected since innate immunity is in place or ready for activation prior to infection or antigenic stimulation and collaborates with adaptive immunity, which is induced by infection or antigenic stimulation. Nevertheless, a few highly positive genetic correlations have been detected between total number of white blood cells and some leukocytes subsets, and between some leukocyte subsets such as total number of lymphocytes, CD4- CD8+ lymphocytes (which contains \u03b1\u03b2 CD4- CD8+ lymphocytes and NK), and NK cells (CD16+ CD2+ cells). Phagocytosis, production of IL8 and TNF, two pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by monocytes and macrophages, were positively correlated with acute inflammatory phase proteins produced by hepatocytes i.e. CRP and HAPT. A high correlation was also found between CRP and HAPT. Clapperton and colleagues [17] have shown that phenotypic correlations between leukocyte subsets and acute phase proteins are weak (<0.2) and not significantly different from zero in agreement with our results. In contrast to our study, Clapperton and collaborators have not detected any significant genetic and phenotypic correlations between different leukocyte subsets except when one subset was nested in another [16].",

The moderate to high heritabilities estimated for many traits together with the selection study on pigs carried out by Wilkie and colleagues a decade ago support the feasibility of selecting for immunocompetence [2], [13]. Chickens have also been successfully divergently selected for carbon clearance (phagocytic activity), high antibody response to Newcastle disease virus three weeks after vaccination (adaptive humoral IR) and wing web response to PHA (high cell-mediated immune response) for more than twelve generations [9], [36].",

Testing this hypothesis will be a key point for further use of ITs as indirect selection criteria in multitrait selection to improve resistance to disease. Some results on genetic and phenotypic relationships between immunocompetence and susceptibility to specific pathogens have already been reported in the literature for pigs. Among pigs selected for eight generations for high (HIR) or low (LIR) response based on an index of four cell and humoral-mediated immunity traits, an increased specific antibody response and lower polyserositis were observed in the HIR pigs compared to the LIR pigs after challenge with a novel pathogen, Mycoplasma hyorhinis\n[12], [37]. Thus, animals with a high IR level to unrelated challenges, as defined by Wilkie and colleagues [12], [37], have a better response to infection with Mycoplasma hyorhinis. However, HIR pigs develop more severe arthritis than LIR pigs. Indeed, the levels of humoral and cell-mediated adaptive ITs included in the Wilkie et al index induce the formation of immune complexes and/or the development of inflammatory responses, central to the pathogenesis of Mycoplasma hyorhinis-induced arthritis. Other correlation tests between ITs and response to various infections are needed. However, it is important to remain cautious with high responder animals, which could develop autoimmune pathologies or pathological iummne responses.",

Negative genetic correlations have been reported between some ITs (monocytes, CD11R1+ cells) and average daily gain [16]. However a larger correlation study considering a higher number of ITs and pig performances is needed and is ongoing in our population. In the future, a more sustainable production system may require a compromise with a slight decrease in performance traded off for a gain in animal robustness. More studies are required to better understand the correlations between ITs and production traits and it is not established which levels of ITs would be good predictors for resistance to pathogens if any. In conclusion, our results show that variation in many ITs is under significant genetic control in pigs and these findings may provide insights in other species. Moreover, based on heritability and correlation estimations, some of the ITs that we have studied might be incorporated into selection schemes, provided they are associated with improved global health and do not exhibit strong antagonisms with other economically important traits.",

They were placed into pens of 30 piglets in a post weaning unit and vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae (Stellamune, Pfizer, one injection) one day after their arrival in the test station, when 36.3 days old in average. All pigs were apparently healthy with no clinical sign of infection. All animals were sampled three weeks after vaccination. Blood samples were collected via the external jugular vein into tubes with or without anti-coagulants, according to further use.",

In order to test if trait distributions deviated from Gaussian, a D'Agostino normality test was used (p = 0.05). Since most traits were not sampled from a Gaussian distribution, they were all normalized using a Box-Cox transformation except for phenotypes reaching the value zero, which were normalized using ln(1+x) transformation. Significant effects of age at the time of vaccination, of time of vaccination, of breeding unit and of time of experiment were detected for most traits by variance analysis taking into account these effects. Normed Principal Component Analysis (PCA, [44], dudi.pca function, ade4 package [45], R software [43]) on a subset of ITs adjusted for age at the time of vaccination, time of vaccination, breeding unit and experiment (Table 1) were performed using a linear model. Clusters of ITs were detected using the R package mclust for normal mixture modelling and model-based clustering [46]. It combines model-based agglomerative hierarchical classification, based on the classification likelihood, and the expectation-maximization (E\u2013M) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of multivariate mixture models. Variance components, genetic parameters and their standard errors were estimated by the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) method [48], using the WOMBAT software [49]. This is the reference method to estimate genetic parameters with a mixed model. Univariate and bivariate mixed linear animal models were employed to estimate heritability and genetic correlations, respectively. For the univariate analyses, the fixed part of the model included experiment time, age at the time of vaccination, vaccination time and herd of origin effects and the random part included a common litter environmental effect and direct genetic effects.
