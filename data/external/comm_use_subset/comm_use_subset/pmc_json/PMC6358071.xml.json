In childhood asthma, a 5 day application of EPs 7630 significantly improved symptoms of a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract [8, 9]. In acute bronchitis, a 7-day course with EPs 7630 improved symptoms and significantly increased the proportion of patients able to attend kindergarten, school or work on day 7 compared to placebo [10, 11].

In regards to lung diseases, such preventive anti-viral strategies have not been investigated.

In addition, ICAM-1 mediated rhinovirus-induced inflammation in asthma and COPD [16, 17]. However, the study by Mukhopadhyay et al [16] was not supporting the hypothesis that ICAM-1 is necessary for rhinovirus infection as described for COPD [14, 17].",

            "text": "The inducible costimulatory (ICOS) and its ligand ICOSL are expressed by human BEC (hBEC) and therefore may support the function of antigen presenting immune cells [18]. In other lung epithelial cell types ICOS expression was linked to ICAM-1 and major histocompatibility protein-1 mediating antigen presentation [19, 20]. Concerning asthma, ICOSL stimulated airway smooth muscle cell proliferation and thus may contribute to hyperplasia in asthma [21]. In the epithelial cell membrane several proteins, summarized as collectins, are expressed and modify the immune response to infections [22]. These proteins have to form complexes, which signal through C1qR (cell surface calreticulin, ecto-calreticulin, calregulin). Interestingly, cell surface C1qR has been reported to bind enteroviruses and to induce phagocytosis, thereby increasing anti-viral cell response in other cell types than epithelial cells [23, 24]. In human bronchial epithelial cells bacterial cell extracts up-regulated C1qR expression by activation of extracellular mitogen activated protein kinases 1/2 [25]. In human immune cells, EPs 7630, reduced the expression of virus stimulated secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10, while it up-regulated IL-6 (interferon \u03b22) through p38 mitogen activated protein kinases [26]. However, a link of EPs 7630 treatment and virus binding proteins has not been investigated for rhinovirus in the context of asthma and COPD.",

In asthma, SOCS1 expression negatively correlated with RV16 or RV1 induced cytokine secretion by BEC [32]. Thus, the results of the latter study also indicate that different strains of rhinovirus may have distinct effects on this host defence mechanism. In monocytes, rhinovirus up-regulated SOCS1 expression on the mRNA level, which correlated with reduced secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL10 and IFN-\u03b1 [33]. Therefore, the role of SOCS1 in response to rhinovirus infection may be cell type specific and should be further investigated.",

The effect of the compound was concentration dependent and also occurred in hBEC which were infected by RV16 24 hours after treatment with EPs 7630 (Fig 3A). There was no significant difference of the overall beneficial effect of EPs 7630 in the three groups of hBEC.

In both reports, the inhibition of ICOS/ICOSL significantly reduced inflammation. Furthermore, ICOSL stimulated proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells and its inhibition may reduce airway wall remodelling in asthma [21]. Thus, the down-regulated expression of ICOS and ICOSL on hBEC by EPs 7630 may have two beneficial effects in chronic inflammatory lung diseases: (i) it reduces the ability of rhinovirus to bind to the host epithelial cell surface and prevent infection, and (ii) it reduces immune cell mediated inflammation. Which of these two effects are responsible for the clinically reported reduced viral infections by EPs 7630 has to be investigated in future studies. However, direct evidence for pro-infectious effect of ICOS and ICOSL in virus infection is missing.",

However, the presented data also indicate that this effect of EPs 7630 may be cell type specific. Further contribution to the beneficial effect of EPs 7630 on host defence against rhinovirus infection is the observation that \u03b2-defensin-1 and SOCS1 were up-regulated after 24 hours. These findings suggest that the host cells may be stimulated to execute intracellular killing of rhinovirus more effectively. The data may also explain the observed improvement of survival of the host cells when incubated for 1 day with EPs 7630 before infection with RV16. However, the role of SOCS1 in the defence against rhinovirus infection is unclear and the literature provides examples of pro-infectious effect, as well as for virus protection [46\u201348].",

There is no information for the effect of rhinovirus infection on \u03b2-defensin-1. In hBEC, RV16 infection slightly reduced the expression of \u03b2-defensin-1, but the effect did not achieve significance. In contrast, EPs 7630 up-regulated the expression of \u03b2-defensin-1, in the absence and presence of RV16. The increased expression of \u03b2-defensin-1 correlated with the decreased infection of hBEC by RV16, but this study could not provide proof of a causal link of both events. Different \u03b2-defensins have been described to help with the clearance of viral or bacterial infections without stimulating inflammation, thus, they are interesting targets for the therapy of any infectious disease [48]. In other species, \u03b2-defensin-1 has been reported to act as an adjuvant for virus vaccination including influenza, hepatitis virus, herpes virus, and carp virus as summarised by Kalenik et al. [49]. However, the mechanisms of \u03b2-defensins by which they protect the host cells against infection have not been well studied.",
