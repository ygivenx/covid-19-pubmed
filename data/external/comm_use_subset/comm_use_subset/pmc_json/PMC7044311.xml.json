We have at least 100 trillion (1014) microbial bacteria and a quadrillion viruses in and on us2. Collectively, the microbial bacteria that are located in and on the body make up our microbiota, and the genes they encode are recognized as our microbiome. Numerous studies have shown that the role of intestinal flora includes nutrient absorption, mucosal barrier fortification, xenobiotic metabolism, angiogenesis, immunity, and response to infection3\u20135. In human studies, many diseases are closely related to anomalies of the intestinal microbial community, comprising of liver cirrhosis, allergies, obesity, diabetes and so on6\u20138. Indeed, indigenous microbiota play a crucial part in the prevention and therapy of microbial infections and are frequently referred to as a \u201cforgotten organ\u201d1,9,10. Our recognition of the gut microbiota and the identification of its composition when contrasted between diseased and healthy states allow the determination of dysbacteriosis, which may be associated with disease progression; thus, this may serve as a new way to diagnose, prevent and treat interventions11.",

The gut dysbacteriosis induced by viruses might promote the replication and transmission of viruses in organisms; this phenomenon has been found for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)14,15. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which can cause a highly infectious respiratory disease and urogenital illness characterized by gout or nephritis in chickens, is a gamma coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae16,17. All IBV strains can infect a wide range of chicken epithelial surfaces, such as the trachea, kidney, proventriculus and intestines18. Some IBV strains are called nephropathogenic IBV (NIBV) because they lead to severe kidney infections in addition to respiratory infections. It is noteworthy that IBV was detectable in intestinal epithelial cells19. Many studies point out that the chicken ileum is a significant location for digestion and nutrient absorption and is home to a diverse microbial community20,21. However, there has been little exploration of the alteration in the gut microbial community structure and abundance in chickens with IBV infection. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish the aetiological link between the IBV and gut microbiota. Here we investigated the ileum microbiome in chickens infected with IBV for a more detailed and comprehensive evaluation.",

However, these methods have limitations: they are inapplicable to nonculturable bacteria and are selective for readily cultivated bacteria13. To address these limitations, molecular techniques have been used to characterize the intestinal microbiota. Illumina sequencing of single or multiple hypervariable region amplification in the 16S rRNA gene is an effective approach for gut microbiome analysis23. In the present study, we elucidated the effects of NIBV infection on the chicken gut microbiome by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The relative abundance data from the ileum microbiome suggested differences between chickens in the INC group and those in the IIBV group infected with NIBV. Therefore, further investigation into the mechanism of this shift will help us understand IBV infection and provide a potential approach to diagnose, treat and prevent interventions.",

These clinical symptoms were not observed in the INC group. The quantification of the viral load by RT-qPCR showed values ranging from 2.96 \u00d7 103 to 3.84 \u00d7 108 genomic copies per 0.2 \u03bcg of RNA, with the lowest viral load in the jejuna and the highest in the kidneys (Fig. 1B).

There were more goblet cells, which appeared as vacuoles when stained by H&E, in the IIBV group than in the INC group (Fig. 1C, red arrow).

According to the lower ACE and Chao1 indices, NIBV infection reduced the community richness compared to that in the INC group (Table 1). In addition, neither the Shannon nor the Simpson indices were significantly different between the IIBV group and the INC group within the experiment (Wilcox, P = 0.5887 and P = 0.9372, respectively). The higher Shannon and Simpson index indicated a higher bacterial diversity, which meant that the NIBV infection decreased the microbial diversity compared to that in the INC group (Fig. 2c,d). In conclusion, these data indicated a smaller bacterial diversity in the ileal microbiota of NIBV infected chickens.",

Under pathological conditions, the microbial community composition changes, including an increase and decrease in bacterial populations, causing changes in a wide rage of metabolic functions32,33. Accordingly, it is certainly necessary to understand the bacterial community composition and changes in gut microbiota with IBV infection. However, the composition of the gut microbiota and how the coronavirus can affect the gut microbiota are still unclear. Therefore, the effects of IBV infection on chicken ileum damage and the ileum microbiome were investigated in our study by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been applied extensively for assessing the phylogenetic distribution of metagenomes. It is known that the bacterial 16S rRNA gene consists of nine hypervariable regions, and sequences generated by applying different combinations of these regions generally present differing profiles of microbial diversity. Therefore, the optimal choice of the hypervariable region(s) and primer combination vary between various ecological communities. Previous research proved that the highest bacterial diversity and species richness in chicken gut microbiomes were obtained using the primer set corresponding to the V3-V4 region34,35. Based on these investigations, in our study, we selected primers targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene.",

These findings suggest that NIBV infection can destroy intestinal mucosal integrity and may slow the growth of intestinal villus epithelial cells. Furthermore, it was reported that intestinal goblet cells play a crucial defensive role in the intestine by synthesizing and secreting several mediators, including mucins and trefoil factor family peptides, which serve defensive and healing functions in the gut38\u201340. In this study, NIBV infection obviously increased the number of goblet cells compared to that in the normal group, which indicated hyperplasia of the goblet cells in the ileum during NIBV infection and may be associated with microbial challenges.",

Consistent with previous findings, in this study, our results demonstrated that NIBV infection decreases the diversity and richness of gut microbiota (Fig. 2c and Table 1). The analysis of the taxonomic composition displayed a reduction in the Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria phyla and an enrichment of the phylum Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the ilea. Importantly, the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli, was increased in the ilea of NIBV-infected chickens. Moreover, the LEfSe results showed that Enterobacteriaceae belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria were over-represented in the IIBV group. Previous research shows that in the case of intestinal inflammation, epithelial cells reduce their capacity to undergo beta-oxidation, with the consequence of an increased availability of oxygen, which is thought to promote the bloom of Proteobacteria and the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota46,47. Further investigations acknowledged that nitrate produced by the host during inflammatory conditions can be exploited by commensal Enterobacteriaceae, which thus become predominant48. Therefore, the increased enrichment of Proteobacteria revealed that the intestinal inflammation in the ilea of NIBV-infected chickens represent a \u201cmicrobial signature\u201d of NIBV infection. The results also showed that NIBV infection decreased the abundance of the members of the Cyanobacteria in the ilea compared to that in the INC group chickens. The Cyanobacteria group has great biodiversity due to its secondary metabolites, which show a broad variety of biological activities, including antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer and immunomodulator or protease inhibitor activities28,49,50. Our results showed a reduction in Cyanobacteria, which indicated that the ability of the chicken ileum to clear viruses was weakened by NIBV infection. Clearly, in the case of viral infection, changes in general metabolic function are closely related to the gain and loss of microbial populations.",

Cox et al. showed that disruption of microbiota (reduction in Allobaculum, Lactobacillus, Rikenellaceae and Candidatus Arthromitus (segmented filamentous bacteria, SFB54)) can induce obesity55. In the present study, we found that Candidatus Arthromitus was dramatically reduced in the IIBV group compared to that in the INC group. However, due to the lack of records of body weight and body fat percentage (BFP) data, it was difficult to verify the direct effect of the reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, such as Candidatus Arthromitus, on the body in this experiment. Fortunately, in the present study, we predicted the unobserved character states in the bacterial community by using PICRUSt, which is generally applied to investigate animal intestinal function56. With respect to the PICRUSt results, the \u201cprimary bile acid biosynthesis\u201d and \u201csecondary bile acid biosynthesis\u201d pathways were significantly enriched in the ilea of the IIBV group chickens. Bile acids are cholesterol-derived compounds synthesized in the liver, and gut microbiota can transfer primary bile acids in the small intestine via deconjugation, dehydroxylation, or dehydrogenation to form so-called secondary bile acids, which promote the intestinal absorption of lipids and affect energy metabolism mainly via the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor (TGR5)57\u201359. A great number of observational studies have indicated that meta-inflammatory disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are always associated with an increase in total bile acid (BA) concentrations60,61. In addition, Annika et al. showed that the levels of iso-DCA, which is a common BA produced by bacteria, were significantly increased in humanized mice with low Clostridia abundance. As highlighted above, we know that the enrichment of bile acid biosynthesis is closely related to the loss of Clostridia, which may act as an important part of host metabolism in response to NIBV infections.",
