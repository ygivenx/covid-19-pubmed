However, in children and immunocompromised individuals, particularly organ transplant recipients, HAdV infections may lead to significant rates of mortality.13, 17, 18, 19",

These data will provide a basis for public health preventive measures, including diagnosis, surveillance, and appropriate protocols for limiting outbreaks and prevention. Specific information of the mutation rates, mutation hotspots, and new variations, particularly at their serologic recognition sites, will play a key role in the development of vaccines against these pathogens. This report presents the bioinformatics analysis of the HAdV-B14p1 Guangzhou strain (GZ01; October 2010), which was the first HAdV-B14 strain isolated in China,12 and compares it with the contemporaneous Beijing strain (BJ430; December 2010) as well as a subsequent strain isolated in 2012 (CHN2012; February 2012). Provided is a high-resolution view of highly similar yet intriguingly divergent genomes, linking one of these strains with the globally re-emergent strain isolated in the U.S. in 2005, and suggesting at least two co-circulating lineages of type 14.",

The genome types of strains GZ01, BJ430, and CHN2012 were determined by in silico REA using the Vector NTI 10.3.0 software (Invitrogen Corp.; San Diego, CA, USA) and in comparison with the other HAdV-B14 strains 4, 34 (Figure 2).

Furthermore, to support the observation that genome type identification may be misleading, it should be noted that while the initial wet-bench REA data suggested 303600 was a novel HAdV-B14a strain, it was disproven by the whole genome analysis.4, 34",

This was generated using a \u2018beta test version\u2019 software, Genome Mutation Mapper (GMM; unpublished) that notes SNPs and indels of query genomes relative to a reference, and confirmed using DNA Sequencher (GeneCodes, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI). The sequence similarities amongst them indicates that although these HAdV-B14p1 viruses have a common ancestor (type 14 serotype), their insertion/deletion (indel) patterns suggest two lineages. Indels and their subsequently inherited conserved patterns across genomes are key markers in determining lineages and for following molecular evolution, as reversion is highly unlikely.64 Both strains GZ01 and BJ430 are highly divergent from the U.S. strain 303600, with respect to the indel patterns; there is one indel distinguishing between GZ01 and BJ430, a deletion at nt 29 481 in the BJ430 genome, that could be interpreted as GZ01 being more similar to 303600. CHN2012 contains a divergent indel pattern with respect to the other two China isolates. In addition to three deletions in common, it contains two additional indels (one each, insertion and deletion), relative to GZ01 and BJ430, that are uniquely also in the prototype genome. This may be indicative of two sub-lineages and independent introductions into China from abroad, or subsequent divergence from one. The indel numbers and patterns suggest there were at least two prototypes circulating in 1950s, time of the first prototype isolate, with one leading to 303600 and the second leading to the cluster of recent China strains. This visualization of the mutations alignment is critical to the understanding of the molecular evolution and lineages of pathogens as the low resolution genome percent nucleotide identities and REA (Figure 2) present very subtle and limited differences. GZ01, BJ430, CHN2012, and 303600 have highly similar percent identities in comparison with the prototype de Wit at 99.646%, 99.666%, 99.684%, and 99.689%, respectively.",

According to the genome analysis of the three HAdV-B14 strains circulating in China, all three strains appear to be of separate, but related, lineages and may likely have been transmitted from abroad. Unlike the past, Beijing and Guangzhou are now \u2018open\u2019 to unrestrictive global travel and this may situate them to be the foci for the introduction of infectious disease agents to and from both overseas and other China provinces. Uniquely, Guangzhou has four additional direct long-standing connections to the international community. First, since the mid-1800s, many China emigrants to overseas destinations have originated from this region; therefore, there has \u2018always\u2019 been direct physical contact through homecoming visits. Second, Guangzhou has hosted several international events recently, bringing in an influx of visitors. For example, the Asian Games (Nov. 2010) was hosted in Guangzhou, bringing in more than 14 000 athletes along with a large number of foreign tourists and regional transient workers. Third, residents of other China provinces migrate to this prosperous region. Finally, Guangzhou is only 119 km from Hong Kong with the populations commingling; both populations are also in close contact with the global community, including Americans from both hemispheres, neighboring Asians, and Europeans, all of which have experienced respiratory diseases linked to the subspecies B2 HAdVs as well as other respiratory pathogens. For instance, from 2002 to 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spread quickly from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and Beijing, and then across the country and globally, with high morbidity and mortality rates. Guangzhou, therefore, serves as an important focal point for infectious disease pathogen introduction, and surveillance is important in order to limit the public health impact on its population and elsewhere in China.",

            "text": "Comparative genomic analysis is leading to discovery of large numbers of novel molecular markers that are proving very helpful in understanding many important aspects of microbial phylogeny;67, 68 of these molecular markers, the conserved indel mutations provide particularly useful means for identifying different groups of microbes in clear molecular terms and for understanding when they have branched off from a common ancestor.67, 69, 70, 71 As reported here, indel mutations analysis suggests two co-circulating lineages from at least two co-circulating \u2018prototype\u2019 strains in 1950s, one giving rise to the 303600 strain and the other giving rise to the China cluster of HAdV-B14. Before the genomics era, many important adenovirus strains were characterized by REA. REA is still useful for characterizing current isolates by providing a bridge between their accessible genome data and the REA data that are only available in the literature, as important references and as historical isolates are no longer available for genomic analysis.72 This report emphasizes that REA data should be carefully considered, as it may be misleading and incorrect. Although the REA analysis confirmed strains GZ01, BJ430, and CHN2012 as belonging to the same genome type 14p1 as strain 303600, high resolution analysis of the genome sequences, including indels, indicate different lineages and introductions into China, along with the absence of fatalities associated with 303600. Again, based on the genome mutation patterns, especially the indels, the de Wit prototype appears to be very different from the 303600 and is similar to the BJ430, GZ01, and CHN2012 strains. These may represent several lineages co-circulating \u2018prototype 14\u2019 strains, with one reported in the original study and the rest accumulating characteristic indel patterns that have been reported in this study. Most of the indels occur in the poly(A) and poly(T) regions, which have been proposed as high-resolution molecular strain markers for characterizing HAdV-14p1.71 The recent report that HAdV-B14 dispersed from U.S. to Asia in 2007 via military trainees53 provides another clue that the emergent HAdV-B14p1 strains in China may have been transmitted from abroad. However, as shown in this report, the whole genome data of that strain is critical for the correct interpretation of that possible transmission pattern.",

Strain GZ01 caused acute suppurative tonsillitis, an upper respiratory disease; however, strain BJ430 was associated with bronchial pneumonia, a lower respiratory tract disease. The reason for this difference in pathogenicity may be due to the genomic differences. A major difference between the two genomes is the two non-synonymous substitutions in the DNA polymerase (K to N) and protein VI genes (R to K), respectively (Table 2). Of these two proteins, the 22-kDa cement protein VI is located beneath the peripentonal hexons in the viral capsid. It is identified as an endosomal membrane lytic factor, which is important for adenoviruses to overcome the barrier of the host cell membrane.73 The non-synonymous substitution of R to K in the protein VI may lead to the function of protein VI being enhanced or weakened, which can presumably further change the HAdV tissue tropism. This is awaiting wet-bench studies.",

There had been no reports of HAdV-B14 in China prior to and during the period noted for HAdV-B14 re-emergence and circulation (2005\u20132009). This report presents the bioinformatics analysis of both HAdV-B14p1 strains in high resolution and detail, and provides putative lineages for these two surprisingly and intriguingly divergent, but, highly similar genomes linking Guangzhou and Beijing (2294 kilometers apart). A comparison with the re-emergent strain isolated in the U.S. (2007) as well as with the less similar but still remarkably conserved genome of the prototype virus from The Netherlands (1955) is also presented. The presentation of high resolution nucleotide sequence data and a map of mutations, particularly of the indels, provide detailed insight into two contemporaneously circulating human pathogens with divergent and parallel lineages. Both are noted as genome type HAdV-B14p1 via their low resolution but conveniently available REA patterns. The computational data presented in this report again demonstrates highly conserved but divergent HAdV-B14 genomes, which supports further studies of the epidemiology and molecular evolution of these related pathogens, and which, in turn, will provide a foundation for developing effective vaccines and public health strategies, including nationwide surveillance.",
