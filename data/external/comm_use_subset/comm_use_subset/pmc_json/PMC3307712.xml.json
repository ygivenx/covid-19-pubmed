            "text": "Alcohol abuse is a risk factor for pulmonary infections. It is not fully understood how alcohol exposure compromises the lung host defense. Previous studies suggest that multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved [1], [2], [3]. Airway mucosal immunity and mucociliary clearance are the two primary host defense mechanisms, which take place in a thin layer of liquid on the top of airway epithelia, known as airway surface liquid (ASL). ASL, composed of a gel-like mucus layer and a sol-like periciliary liquid layer [4], [5], [6], is the \u201cbattlefield\u201d for pulmonary infection and immunity. The viscous mucous blanket traps inhaled microorganisms and particles to restrict their spreading in the lung. In contrast, the watery periciliary liquid (PCL) underneath pools antimicrobial substances, antibodies, cytokines, chemokines and other immune modulators [7], [8], [9]. More importantly, PCL provides the milieu for innate and adaptive immune cells including neutrophils and macrophages to home and function. Moreover, PCL prevents cilia from being entrapped in viscous mucus and bathes them for mechanical movement for mucociliary clearance [5], [10].",

Mounting evidence indicates that paracrine/autocrine purinergic signaling is critical to airway epithelial ion transport and ASL hydration [12]#. Adenosine has been shown to be a potent regulator in the process, which can be directly released by local epithelial cells and immune cells [13] or from extracellular metabolism of ATP [12]#. It is known that ATP is constitutively released by epithelia due to various stimuli including mechanical stretch and shear stress due to respiration [14]. The released ATP is then converted to adenosine by extracellular ectonucleotidases [15]. Thus, ASL has relatively high levels of adenosine. Further studies demonstrate that adenosine largely regulates epithelial CFTR channel function by acting on A2BAR [16], [17], [18]. Thus, the adenosine-A2BAR signaling pathway is a crucial element in lung host defense [19], [20].",

Two buffers with asymmetric chloride were applied: apical low chloride (10.4 mM) and basolateral high chloride (139.8 mM). After voltage clamp, sodium channels were blocked by apical amiloride (100 \u00b5M) and ISC was stimulated by apical addition of adenosine (100 \u00b5M).

To explore if the alcohol-suppressed ISC, as identified above, is actually a chloride current, we first confirmed chloride transport by Calu-3 epithelia in our experimental setting. To this end, the cultured Calu-3 epithelia without any alcohol exposure were subjected to ISC measurement in the presence of various inhibitors to block different ion channels. Bumetanide (100 \u00b5M), a specific inhibitor for the Na+-K+-2Cl\u2212 cotransporter, was applied to the basolateral side of the Calu-3 epithelia after adenosine stimulation. This drug decreased ISC by \u223c58%, while acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and DNDS, an inhibitor for Na+/HCO3\n\u2212 cotransporters and Cl\u2212/HCO3\n\u2212 exchangers, had no effect on ISC (\nFig. 2A\n). These data suggest that the adenosine-stimulated anion current that is suppressed by alcohol is the chloride channel conductance. The result was further validated by measuring the adenosine-stimulated ISC with identical apical and basal chloride buffers. Without chloride gradient (\nFig. 2B\n), adenosine-induced ISC was dropped significantly by Student's t-test (p<0.01, n = 5). The ISC was only \u223c8% of that measured with the asymmetric chloride buffers.",

Because CFTR is a cAMP-activated chloride channel, we hypothesized that ethanol inhibits adenosine-stimulated cAMP production to cause a reduced CFTR channel activity. To test this hypothesis, air-liquid interface cultures of Calu-3 cells were exposed basolaterally to either 0 mM or 100 mM of ethanol for 24 hours. These cells were apically stimulated with 100 \u00b5M of adenosine as described above for 10 minutes, the time point at which the epithelial ISC was at its peak levels. Then, the cells were lysed and the levels of cellular cAMP assayed. The results demonstrate that ethanol pre-treatment significantly decreased adenosine-stimulated cAMP levels (p<0.05, n = 5) (\nFig. 5A\n). In addition, to test whether the decrease in cAMP was in fact causing the suppression of adenosine-stimulated chloride transport by ethanol, Sp-cAMPS, a cell permeable and phosphodiesterase-resistant cAMP analogue, was used to directly activate PKA which then activates the CFTR channel. As shown in \nFigure 5B\n, the alcohol-treated Calu-3 cells in the presence of 10 \u00b5M Sp-cAMPS obliterated the ethanol suppressive effect on adenosine-induced chloride secretion (p<0.05, n = 6).

Multiple defense systems have been evolved in airways. First, the polarized airway epithelia have a mechanical clearance mechanism. Goblet cells or submucosal glands secrete mucus that entraps airborne particles and inhaled infectious agents. Synchronized ciliary movement sweeps inhaled particulate matter toward the mouth to be expectorated or swallowed [34]#. Second, airway epithelia secrete antimicrobial factors, such as lysozyme and \u03b2-defensins [35]. Third, airways and alveoli are patrolled by phagocytic cells, most notably the alveolar macrophage, which can engulf microbes [36]. Fourth, airways can recruit neutrophils and monocytes to sites of inflammation [37]. Fifth, the acquired immune system, including antigen-stimulated T and B lymphocytes, provides cellular and humoral defenses for the airways [38], [39]. It is noteworthy that all the above-mentioned pulmonary defense mechanisms are executed in ASL, the thin film of liquid on top of the airway epithelia. Therefore, ASL homeostasis is pivotal to lung host defense.

On epithelial apical surface, adenosine binds to A2bAR, a predominant adenosine receptor present in airway epithelia [16]. This receptor is coupled to Gs protein to activate adenylyl cyclase, which elevates intracellular cAMP and consequently activates PKA. Then, CFTR is phosphorylated by PKA and the channel opens to permeate chloride [40]#. More chloride in ASL will cause less Na+ absorption and more water retention, thus increasing ASL height and volume [15], [20]. It is even speculated that adenosine is a sensor for ASL homeostasis. When ASL falls, adenosine levels increase in airways beyond their basal levels and activate A2BAR and CFTR channels [16], [29]. Our data have linked ethanol-suppression of cAMP levels to attenuation of chloride secretion by airway epithelia. Previous studies have documented that ethanol decreases ciliary beating and epithelial cell migration during wound repair which are associated with compromised cAMP signaling and PKA activation [21], [41]. Moreover, alcohol is reported to upregulate the PDE4 enzyme expression as well as the enzymatic activity in epithelia [22] #, which results in accelerated cAMP degradation. Thus, our data are consistent with the data reported, indicating that alcohol modulates various cellular pathways by reducing cellular cAMP levels.",

            "text": "Pulmonary mucociliary clearance is largely affected by three factors: 1) mucus production, 2) ciliary sweeping and, 3) ASL state. Studies on human bronchial epithelial cells have revealed that a 24-hour exposure with 100 mM of alcohol caused an 8-fold increase in trachea-bronchial mucin gene expression [42]. Interestingly, experiments using bovine bronchial epithelial cells have established that alcohol exposure at 100 mM beyond 6 hours decreases ciliary beating frequency [22], [41]. A recent publication by Allen-Gipson and colleagues reports that purinergic stimulation of CBF requires A2BAR activation [43]. Similarly, in rats chronic alcohol administration decreased ciliary beating frequency and enhanced lung colonization of nasally administered S. pneumoniae\n[44] #. Our current results demonstrate that 24-hour ethanol exposure reduces chloride secretion, which consequently alters ASL composition and volume. Thus, alcohol affects all three mucociliary clearance components.",

This finding is of clinical implications. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as papaverine may improve mucociliary clearance in alcoholics by enhancing airway epithelial ion secretion and ciliary beating. Moreover, enhancement of airway epithelial ion secretion alters the composition of ASL.
