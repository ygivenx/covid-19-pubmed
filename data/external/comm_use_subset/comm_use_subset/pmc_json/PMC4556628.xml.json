Although lacking essential components of the mammalian innate and adaptive immune systems, such as interferons, antibodies, B cells, T cells and MHC antigens, mosquitoes have been shown to respond to viral infection by a range of mechanisms including RNA interference (RNAi) and by activation of several evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways, include the Toll, Imd/JNK and Jak-STAT [4\u20137]. Transcriptome analysis using genome-wide microarrays [8\u201311] have also revealed complex dynamics of mosquito transcripts during infection and identified changes in expression of genes from diverse cellular processes, including ion binding, transport, metabolic processes and peptidase activity. Gene expression is also tissue-specific, with differences reported between midgut and salivary glands [10].",

Using a complex set of processes, it affects a myriad of cellular pathways [13]. Ubiquitin itself is a highly conserved 76-amino-acid protein that is highly conserved in sequence from yeast to human [14]. Ubiquitylation is brought about by a cascade of enzymes. E1, ubiquitin activating enzyme, transfers activated ubiquitin to E2, the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. E3, ubiquitin protein ligase, binds ubiquitin-charged E2 and the substrate, facilitating ligation of ubiquitin to the internal lysine residue on the substrate [15,16]. Substrate specificity is largely determined by the E3 ligase. The E3 family is characterised by the presence of the HECT (Homologous to E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) [17], RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger [18], U-box [19] and PHD (Plant Homeo-Domain) [20] or LAP (Leukemia-Associated Protein) finger domains [21]. E3 ligases can work as single or multi-subunit complex. The multi-subunit complexes include a RING-finger subunit and a member of cullin family that binds the RING-finger protein [22]. They also include structural adaptor proteins that link cullin to substrate recognition elements [23].",

            "text": "The ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway has been shown to be important in all stages of viral infection in mammalian cells, including entry, transcription, replication, assembly and exit of virus particles from the cell. A number of ubiquitin enzymes have been found to be involved in the flavivirus infection process. UBE1 has been shown to be important for dengue virus infection in primary human endothelial cells [24]. E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBLL1 (HAKAI) has been found to be important during WNV endocytosis [25], but not in dengue entry [26]. Interestingly, there are also examples of viruses encoding ubiquitin ligases, which lead to evasion of host immunity, by degradation of immune proteins. For example, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) immediate-early transcription factor RTA encodes ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that targets IRF7, a key mediator of type I interferon induction, for proteasome-mediated degradation [27]. As an alternate strategy, viruses also encode adaptors that recruit and redirect host E3 ligases to ubiquitylate host proteins, leading to degradation. Adenoviruses express proteins which recruit a cullin-based E3 ligase to target p53 for degradation [28]. Several paramyxoviruses limit the activity of interferons by targeting STATs for ubiquitylation and degradation via interaction of their highly conserved V proteins and host Cul4A RING E3 ligase [29,30].",

Experiments were performed to determine the significance of the proteasomal pathway in WNV infected Culex cells. Hsu cells were pretreated with 0.1, 1 or 10 \u03bcM MG132 (specific proteasomal inhibitor) from 1 h prior to WNV infection (MOI 10), and supernatant media and total RNA from cells were collected at 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR using primers specific for WNV NS1 gene showed a dose-dependent decrease in viral replication, with the NS1 RNA level reducing by more than 80% following treatment with 10 \u03bcM MG132 (Fig 2A). Cell viability assay showed no significant toxicity for MG132 at concentrations used in the assay (S1 Fig). Plaque assays performed on the supernatant media showed a similar dose-dependent decrease in viral titers, with a 20-fold reduction in cells treated with 10 \u03bcM MG132 (30 pfu/ml) compared to untreated controls (600 pfu/ml) (Fig 2B). These results suggest the proteasomal pathway is required for efficient WNV replication in Culex cells.",

CPIJ010574 is orthologous to mammalian Cullin4A and Cullin 4B (~70% amino acid identity with both) (S3 Fig) and is therefore referred to here as CxCul4. Cullin-RING ligases, such as Cullin4A, have been found to be upregulated during WNV infection of mammalian cells and implicated in various cellular processes such cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, DNA replication as well as viral replication [33]. Initially, in vivo validation of RNA-Seq analysis was performed using a mosquito infection model. Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were infected with WNV (NY99-4132 strain) by blood-feeding. Total RNA was collected from whole carcasses and dissected midguts at 24 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR performed using CxCul4-specific primers showed approximately 4- and 12-fold increases in mRNA in carcass and midgut, respectively, compared with control mosquitoes fed on uninfected blood (Fig 3A).",

Total RNA was collected 48 hpi and real-time RT-qPCR was performed using primers for Vir1, a reporter gene regulated by Jak-STAT pathway [34], and CxVago, a reporter gene regulated by the TRAF-Rel2 pathway [35]. As expected, expression of both CxVir1 and CxVago was upregulated following WNV infection. However, whilst there was no significant difference in CxVago expression following CxCul4 overexpression, CxVir1 upregulation was suppressed significantly in CxCul4-overexpressing cells compared with empty vector transfected cells (Fig 4A). Previous studies have shown that, once expressed, CxVago is secreted and activates the Jak-STAT pathway in Culex cells [7]. Therefore, Hsu cells were transfected with CxVago and the supernatant medium was collected 72 h post-transfection. Fresh Hsu cells were then transfected with the CxCul4 overexpression plasmid and, at 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with medium containing CxVago to activate the Jak-STAT pathway. Real-time RT-qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 h after media replacement showed expression of CxVir1 was upregulated in control (empty vector transfected) cells but upregulation of CxVir1 was suppressed significantly in cells overexpressing CxCul4 (Fig 4B).

As a control, mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against GFP. The mosquitoes were infected with WNV (NY99 strain) by blood-feeding 24 h post-microinjection. At 10 days post-infection, saliva from individual mosquitoes was collected in a capillary tube (see methods) and total RNA was collected from whole mosquito carcass and midgut. As a parallel experiment, mosquitoes were collected at day 2 and day 10 post-infection. Western blot was performed on whole mosquito using anti-CxSTAT and anti-actin antibodies. Results showed increased levels of CxSTAT by day 2 post-infection. The levels decreased to baseline by day 10 post-infection in control mosquitoes (GFP dsRNA); however in mosquitoes with CxCul4 dsRNA, STAT levels remained high (Fig 5E). Real-time RT-qPCR results showed efficient knock-down (>60%) of CxCul4 mRNA in carcass after Cul4 dsRNA microinjections (Fig 6A). The results also showed a decrease (>50%) in viral RNA (NS1) in whole mosquito carcass (Fig 6B) and midgut (Fig 6D) in CxCul4 dsRNA-injected mosquitoes compared with the control, confirming pro-viral effect of CxCul4. Interestingly, real-time RT-qPCR results also showed a significant increase in CxVir1 mRNA expression in carcass (3-fold) (Fig 6C) and midgut (5-fold) (Fig 6E) in CxCul4-knockdown mosquitoes, indicating increased Jak-STAT signaling. Plaque assays performed on mosquito saliva showed a significantly lower virus titer in mosquito saliva microinjected with CxCul4 dsRNA (88 pfu/mosquito) compared with control (GFP dsRNA) (429 pfu/mosquito) (Fig 6F), indicating a lower likelihood of virus transmission by CxCul4 silenced mosquitoes. It should be noted that saliva from 3 mosquitoes with CxCul4 dsRNA injection showed higher viral titers (similar to controls). Further analysis showed that CxCul4 was not efficiently knocked down in these three mosquitoes (Fig 6A, inset). These results further validate that CxCul4 has a pro-viral effect by inhibiting Jak-STAT pathway during WNV infection in mosquitoes. It should also be noted that ~20\u201330% of mosquitoes from each group did not show any virus in the saliva, possibly indicative of vector competence of these mosquito species.",

            "text": "Proteasomal inhibition has been shown previously to affect replication of a wide range of viruses in mammalian cells, including herpesviruses [40], poxviruses [41], hepadnaviruses [42], adenoviruses [43], influenza viruses [44], retroviruses [45], coronaviruses [46], paramyxoviruses [47] and rotaviruses [48]. Microarray studies have also shown that several ubiquitin-related genes are induced following infection in mosquito cells [32]. The ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway is one of the major pathways involved in post-translational modifications, leading to degradation of proteins. It has also been implicated in various stages of viral infection in mammalian cells including virus entry, replication and exit [49]. The largest family of ubiquitin ligases (E3) is a group of proteins that contain a RING domain, a structural motif comprising eight cysteine and histidine residues that form the interface with E2 (ubiquitin conjugating) enzyme [18]. Substrate specificity is determined by variant RING ubiquitin ligases and also by multiprotein complexes that contain a conserved RING protein. Cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are one such family of proteins, containing eight mammalian members, each with different substrate specificity [22]. These proteins have been implicated in many cellular processes including cell-cycle regulation and cell signaling. Because of this, cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are frequently targeted by viruses to evade host immunity [33]. Viruses redirect these ligases to select specific host proteins for degradation in order to prevent the host response and promote viral replication and dissemination. For example, viruses have been shown to use cullins to prevent cellular apoptosis by degrading p53 [50] or inhibit the innate antiviral response by blocking interferon signaling [30]. In mammals, interferon is a key component of a major innate defensive response against invading viruses by activating Jak-STAT pathway and the expression of antiviral genes in neighbouring cells [51]. Some members of the Paramyxoviridae have been shown to hijack cullin4A ubiquitin ligase complexes to overcome the interferon response, by promoting degradation of STAT proteins. Specifically, the V protein of simian virus 5 causes degradation of STAT1 [29], while the parainfluenza virus V protein causes degradation of STAT2 via the Cul4A substrate adaptor DDB1 [52].",

            "text": "Recently, Culex Vago, which is induced in mosquitoes in response to WNV infection, was found to be functionally similar to mammalian interferon in that it is activated via the TRAF-NF-\u03baB pathway and, upon secretion, activates the Jak-STAT pathway and an antiviral response in neighbouring cells [7,35]. Our results here suggest that Culex STAT is regulated by Culex Cul4 (mammalian Cul4A/B ortholog), which has proviral activity during WNV infection, and that WNV may target STAT for degradation by inducing Culex Cul4 via NS1 and NS5 proteins. Suppression of the mammalian interferon-mediated Jak-STAT pathway has been shown to be a common property of vector-borne flaviviruses. Dengue NS5 protein has been shown to target STAT2 for degradation [53] and WNV NS5 suppressed phosphorylation of STAT1 [54], leading to decreased signaling in mammalian system. Interestingly, our results suggest that the mosquito Jak-STAT pathway is also targeted by WNV via cullin RING ubiquitin ligase. Although, we have identified WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins to be responsible for upregulation of Cul4, the exact mechanism of this activation remains unknown. WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins have significantly different protein sequences, however both are involved in formation of viral replication complex. Studies are currently underway to determine whether this plays any part in the described mechanism. Our in vivo results also suggest that CxCul4 proviral activity may be mainly localized in the mosquito midgut and knockdown of CxCul4 increases Jak-STAT signaling in the midgut, thus decreasing the overall viral load in the body and, in turn, the saliva of these mosquitoes.",

Our results suggest that proteasomal pathway (and CxCullin4) does not play any role in WNV entry in mosquito cells (S5 Fig). This is different than previously reported mechanism in mammalian cells [25]. This may be due to different mechanisms of viral entry in mammalian cells versus mosquito cells. It is also interesting that a number of reads from our data did not map to the published Culex quinquefasciatus transcriptome. Many of these transcripts may be expressed from unannotated genes which contribute to novel host-pathogen interactions in invertebrates.",
