Pneumococcal infections are a common cause of severe, community-acquired illnesses, including community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization, bacteremia, and meningitis [8]. While the introduction of antibiotics dramatically reduced the case fatality rate (CFR) for pneumococcal disease, the current CFR for bacteremic pneumococcal disease is still estimated at 5-10% in the United States, and may be twice as high among the elderly and in cases of meningitis [9,10]. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactam agents, macrolides, and other antibiotic classes is an important clinical concern [11]. Although the introduction of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines has been associated with a reduction in disease incidence [12], the recent increase in invasive infection by non-vaccine serotypes [13], which may be highly resistant to commonly-used antimicrobials [14], suggests that this microorganism will persist in challenging both the medical and public health communities.",

Our objective was to investigate how environmental factors influence IPD occurrence in Philadelphia County. We used both traditional analytic methods (i.e., Poisson regression with seasonal smoothers) and a novel case-crossover method to examine the effects of acute weather fluctuations on IPD occurrence. Both methods reduce confounding by environmental, behavioural, and infectious influences that might otherwise distort the observed magnitude of environmental effects on disease risk.",

Information pertaining to air quality in Philadelphia County during the years of interest-including concentrations of lead, ozone, sulphur oxides and particulate matter-was obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency [20]. Because daily readings were taken at various locations throughout the region, the arithmetic means of the air quality values were used as exposure variables. UV index forecast estimates for Philadelphia during the same period were retrieved from the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center [21]. Clear-sky UV indices represent an integral of measured UV radiation levels weighted by the ability of the different UV wavelengths to cause skin erythema. The issued UV index is a similar measure, which accounts for the effect of clouds on radiation transmission; because of inconsistencies in cloud measurement during the study period, we used the clear-sky UV index as our exposure variable.",

We evaluated the seasonality of disease occurrence through construction of periodograms and autocorrelograms [15,22] for weekly case counts. As yearly periodicity was observed, we estimated seasonal and year-on-year trends in IPD occurrence using Poisson regression models that incorporated sine and cosine oscillators, with 52 week (annual) frequencies (i.e., incorporated fast Fourier transforms) [7,22].",

This approach provides a means for evaluating the association between brief, transient exposures and rare outcomes. The design is characterized by \"self matching\", in that cases serve as their own controls. In the context of environmental epidemiology, a \"case\" is a day on which a case occurred, while a \"control\" is an appropriately selected day on which a case did not occur [6]. We used a time-stratified 2:1 matched case-crossover design in which hazard periods were defined as the reported date of IPD onset from Philadelphia County public health. Beginning on January 1, 2002 the person-time at risk was divided into three-week time strata. Control periods were chosen by matching the hazard period by day of the week within the stratum, and could both precede, both follow, or straddle the hazard period [26,27]. Random directionality of control selection was used in order to avoid biases that can occur with unidirectional or uniform bidirectional control selection [26]. The 1-3 day incubation period of S. pneumoniae was used to estimate the lag days between acute environmental occurrence and case onset, or plausible effect period [28]. We also evaluated effects during the period immediately preceding incubation (i.e., 4-6 day lags) to evaluate the possibility that environmental conditions might affect risk via enhanced transmission of S. pneumoniae. We evaluated the effects of both raw environmental exposures, and quantile ranks within time strata through construction of conditional logistic regression models [24]. Analyses were performed using SAS version 8.01 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Stata version 9.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).",

The seasonality of IPD is well recognized, but poorly understood. Epidemiological mechanisms invoked to explain this pattern have included co-occurrence of other infectious diseases [4], wintertime social gatherings [5], and seasonal oscillation in immune function [29]. However, concurrent seasonal changes in a variety of environmental, behavioural, and epidemiogical exposures make identification of causal associations particularly challenging [30]. We attempted to address this challenge by using analytic approaches that should control for seasonal confounders, known and unknown, at different time scales. At a weekly time scale we found increases in UV radiation to be most strongly associated with decreased numbers of invasive pneumococcal disease cases, though average temperatures also appeared to influence disease risk. At short time scales, fluctuations in ambient air quality, as manifested by differences in concentrations of sulphur oxides, were associated with changes in risk. The direction of this association was at variance with existing models relating air pollution to pneumonia occurrence [3,31,32].",

The degree to which such seasonal oscillation can result in \"just so\" stories that lead to misattribution of causation to non-specific seasonal exposures is highlighted in the univariable analyses we conducted without including seasonal oscillators. In these models, a variety of environmental conditions, including weather variables and air quality indices, were strongly associated with IPD risk. However, after controlling for non-specific seasonality, only UV radiation (and, more weakly, temperature) were associated with disease risk; indeed, the apparent protective effect of UV radiation was actually strengthened after controlling for seasonal oscillation.

Indeed, there are several mechanisms that may have substantial biological plausibility. Modulation of risk may occur through direct effects of UV radiation on host immune function: Dowell reviewed a variety of immunological changes associated with diminished UV radiation exposure in experimental settings, and noted that in granulocyte and monocyte function were reduced during periods of short light exposure [33]. UV radiation also influences the production of 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D, which has important immunomodulatory functions [34]. Namely, enhanced maturation of macrophages, macrophage secretion of bactericidal substances such as lysozomal enzyme phosphatase and hydrogen peroxide [33,35], and secretion of antimicrobial peptides (including cathelicidins and defensins) by both immune cells, and respiratory tract epithelium [36]. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a marked increase in the risk of pneumonia [37], and most human vitamin D is acquired via sun exposure. Thus, extended periods of low UV light could result in an increased susceptibility to S. pneumoniae infection resulting from a lack of vitamin D production, though the week-to-week fluctuations in risk described in this paper may be too rapid to represent a vitamin D effect.",

Many bacterial respiratory pathogens, including pneumococcus, are transmitted in respiratory secretions over short distances (i.e., via \"large droplet transmission\"), and thus encounter the physical environment directly during transmission events. The bactericidal effects of UV-B radiation have been well known for decades; such radiation inactivates bacteria by causing harmful genetic mutations through creation of pyrimidine dimers [38]. A model of UV effect via diminished transmissibility, rather than decreased host susceptibility, is supported by our finding that UV effect is strongest in the youngest individuals in the population (i.e., toddlers), where disease risk is likely to be driven by mobility, contact with peers, prolonged carriage and carelessness with respiratory secretions. We found very little protective effect against IPD in oldest individuals, whose risk may be more strongly linked to immune senescence than to high rates of contact with infectious contemporaries [39,40].",

We suspect that this increase is less likely to represent a true surge in disease rates, which have actually been falling in the U.S. with the introduction of 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine [41]; rather, we suspect that this increase, which is more attenuated after 2003, represents the gradual increase in reporting that commonly follows implementation of new infectious disease reporting requirements [42].",

First among these is our heavy reliance on public health surveillance data which is known to suffer from under-reporting of notifiable infectious diseases [43]. Thus our data set may be incomplete, consisting of only a subset of the cases of IPD in Philadelphia during the study period. However, selection bias will only be introduced if the notification of infectious diseases to public health was correlated with meteorological patterns (e.g., cases which occur during days with higher UV index have a greater likelihood of being diagnosed and reported), which seems unlikely [44]. Second, we obtained weather data from a single site at Philadelphia International Airport, and air pollution and UV data were averaged over several locations throughout the county, which may not represent the true exposure status of individual cases. This is probable non-differential misclassification, and will bias the results towards the null hypothesis. The effects seen here are most likely conservative, weakening the strength of observed associations and suggesting our estimates tend towards the lower bound [44].",

Further study is needed, but this result is consistent with observed patterns of respiratory infectious disease, and would be consistent with several biologically plausible models of effect. As the nature of future changes in UV radiation related to climate change are more difficult to predict than general changes in temperatures or precipitation patterns, the implications of these findings for future pneumococcal disease epidemiology are unclear [45]. Nonetheless, we believe this observation goes some way towards explaining the notable seasonality of IPD, and could conceivably lead to novel disease control strategies through improved understanding of this common and virulent infectious disease.",
