These are sporadic outbreaks in layers of varying ages, during lay and affected flocks generally show a drop in egg production in addition to the production of shell-less eggs. This condition is known as \u201cshell-less egg syndrome\u201d (SES) and is thought to be caused by a strain of IBV since some strains of IBV are known to target the shell gland of the reproductive tract where the shell of the egg is formed [1]. IBV is known to cause egg-shell abnormalities in layers including soft thin shells [2], distorted shells [2], and discolored shells [3].",

Although no specific reproductive-tract-tropic IBV strains are known, some IBV strains can cause lesions in the reproductive tract and the respiratory tissues [7]. IBV replicates in the ciliated cells of the epithelial lining of the chicken oviduct including magnum, tubular shell gland, and shell gland pouch [7]. Disruption of these mucosal cells during an IBV infection could cause the chicken to lay eggs with shell abnormalities. Egg production reduction due to IBV infection generally is between 3 and 10% but in exceptional cases can be as high as 50% [9]. Also, it has been estimated that chickens that recover from IBV infection may continue to produce about 10% fewer eggs compared to their expected normal production levels over the laying period [9].",

The spike protein (S) 1 gene is the most variable and the main inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies, while S2 is relatively conserved [18,20,21,22,23]. Therefore, sequencing of the S1 gene is the foremost technique that is used to differentiate IBV strains into various genotypes [17,20,21,22,23,24,25]. IBV strains circulating in Canada were characterized [21,25,26,27] through the analysis of a 505-nucleotide fragment of the S1 gene obtained during IBV infection outbreaks in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The characterized IBV isolates of these Canadian provinces belonged to nine genotypes [21]. Further, in this study, the IBV strain 4/91 was found to be endemic to Ontario. Similarly, RFLP analysis of three field isolates from an IBV outbreak of a broiler chicken flock in Joliette in the province of Quebec, Canada using full-length S1 gene amplification, detected a new phylogenetic cluster [21]. A 600-nucleotide fragment of the S1 gene was used for characterization of five field isolates from Ontario, Canada, and this study reported the amino acid similarity of 55 to 71% to the M41 reference and MILDVAC-Ma5 vaccine strains [25]. There has been limited work done on the molecular nature of the IBV strains circulating in the Western part of Canada. This study aimed to determine whether IBV is associated with egg layer flocks affected with SES in Western Canada. The additional objectives were to isolate and molecularly characterize these IBV isolates and to reproduce SES experimentally with aiming to establish the etiology of SES.",

The amino acid similarity with the Mass vaccine strain ranged from 98.2% (16AB-20) to 88.5% (16AB-24) (Supplementary Figure S1). According to the inferred protein phylogenetic tree, the current isolates, 15SK-09, 15SK-25, and 16AB-24 formed a separate cluster from the Conn genotype (Figure 2). These 3 isolates were related to Canada Ontario strains but have emerged from earlier branches.

Three of the current isolates were related to China and Korean Mass type isolates while the majority (9) of the current isolates were clustered with the prototype M41 strain. Many of the amino acid sequences deduced from the 30 partial S1 gene sequences were identical; there were 8 unique amino acid sequences (only the current isolates representing the 8 unique amino acid sequences are shown in Supplementary Figure S1); the 6 isolates in the cluster II were similar.

The Mass type isolates, 15SK-12, 16AB-13, 16AB-15, 16AB-20, and 16AB-22 carried differences to the rest of the Mass-type isolates, which were mostly similar.

Unlike in other Canadian provinces, the IBV strains observed in Western Canada are mainly of Mass and Conn genotypes. However, further studies are required in order to classify these IBV isolates serologically. Some data on the incidence and distribution of IBV isolates have been published in Canada, but there was limited information available about strains in the Western regions, notably AB and SK. In Quebec, between 1976 and 1980, 24 isolates of IBV have been characterized based on serum neutralization assay [34] which included Conn, Holland, and SE-17 types. In 1987, five IBV isolates recovered from unvaccinated layer flocks with a history of respiratory illness and increased mortality in Ontario have been recorded as Mass type based on serum neutralization assay [35]. Between 1996\u20131999, in Quebec and New Brunswick, three IBV isolates have been characterized based on sequencing [27] which recorded variants of IBV due to recombination of Mass vaccine and Ark type strains. In 2002, a variant of DE/072/92 with clinical signs of respiratory involvement and a nephropathogenic variant of PA/1220/9 had been isolated in Ontario poultry flocks [25,26]. During 2000\u20132003, IBV variant strains had been isolated in poultry flocks in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador [21] which recorded nine IBV genotypes. These nine genotypes included Canadian variant virus (strain Qu_mv, the classic and vaccine-like viruses, Conn and Mass) and US variant-like virus strains (California 1734/04, California 99, CU_82792, Pennsylvania 1220/98, and Pennsylvania Wolg/98) and non-Canadian, non-US virus (strain 4/91). During 2014\u20132017, involving samples from Ontario and Quebec, 10 genotypes of IBV have been identified which included Mass, Conn, NT, PA Wolg98, Qu-MV, 4/91, CA1737, DE072, DMV, and GA2015 genotypes [36].",

            "text": "IBV infection in very young chickens can cause permanent damage to the oviduct, resulting in the cystic oviduct and fully grown false layer chickens [37]. IBV infection in laying chickens typically results in low egg production and eggshell defects [38]. For example, in an experiment involving 77-week-old white leghorn chickens, it has been shown that an Ark strain of IBV leads to 15% lower egg production, lower eggshell weight, poor egg internal quality, and fewer grade A eggs and more grade B and C eggs when compared to the controls [16]. The egg production losses generally are 3\u201310%, but it could be as high as 50% in some IBV outbreaks [39]. Also, it has been estimated that birds that recover from IBV infection may continue to produce about 10% fewer eggs than normal production levels over the laying period [9]. However, we could not find any literature that indicates that IBV infection in chickens in lay leads to shell-less eggs. Similar to EDSV, the IBV isolate, 15AB-01, that led to shell-less eggs, also showed evidence of IBV infection in the reproductive tract including shell gland [12]. In the IBV infected (15AB-01 isolate) chicken edema in the shell gland mucosa was evident and similar occurrence of edema had been detected following infection with EDSV [40]. Although the latter study also recorded other histological changes such as degeneration and desquamation of the ciliated epithelial cells, atrophy of the uterine glands and heterophil cell infiltration in the shell gland, we did not observe these changes at 21 dpi. However, we recognize that our experiment was not designed to study these pathological changes in the early stages of 15AB-01 IBV isolate infection and further studies are required to investigate the pathological consequences of the SES IBV in the shell gland of the chickens in lay. It is also important to note that the current SES reproduction study did not include a control group with prototype IBV, M41, in the animal experiment, and this is a limitation that we consider in concluding our study findings.",

Similar to EDSV, the Mass type IBV isolate, 15AB-01 was capable of experimentally inducing shell-less eggs in SPF chickens, consistent with the observed association of this isolate with SES in the field outbreaks. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the pathogenesis of SES and identifying an appropriate vaccine for the control of SES in layer flocks in Western Canada.",
