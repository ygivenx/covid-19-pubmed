            "text": "Over the past three decades, the swine industry in the United States has experienced several significant disease outbreak events with highly pathogenic viral pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and, most recently, the swine enteric coronaviruses, including porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (1\u20134). These disease events have resulted in significant clinical consequences with increased morbidity and mortality, in some cases reaching 100%, as well as economic devastation to the swine industry with financial losses estimated in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars (1, 5). Among other shared characteristics, all three causative agents had been previously known to cause mild or non-pathogenic disease in swine prior to the re-emergence event (4). Additionally, emerging and/or novel diseases that present with common clinical signs consistent with expected production diseases may be present yet remain undetected for some time, contributing to widespread transmission amongst the industry and hindering local containment. Thus, once identified, the unforeseen emergence of a disease outbreak with high morbidity, high mortality, and rapid, transboundary spread brings about fundamental questions regarding the epidemiology and origin of the agent as well as an immediate need for both short- and long-term response activities and mitigation strategies to control the outbreak and prevent future events (4).",

Additionally, genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that United States (U.S.) strains of PEDV were closely related to Chinese strains, particularly the 2012 strain from Anhui Province in China (10), fueling concerns that imported, contaminated commodities from China may have been the route of introduction into the United States. Growing anecdotal evidence and early investigative studies (11) have further implicated feed and feed ingredients as the possible transmission vehicle for PEDV although the source(s) and route(s) of introduction have not been definitively identified. Compounded by the recent outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in Asia and Europe1, there is rising concern that contaminated imported commodities, particularly non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed, could introduce and transmit viral pathogens of significant concern to the U.S. swine industry.",

PHFD is considered a PRRS-related syndrome. Using a survey administered to individual households in a southern province of Vietnam, investigators found that, among other things, the use water green crop as pig feed and the presence of ducks, with or without direct contact with pigs were positively associated with clinical signs consistent with PHFD in swine. Water green crop are fed directly to pigs after harvest, without processing. The authors hypothesize that ducks potentially amplify the virus, similar to data shown for PRRSV, and contaminate the water green crop fed to pigs. It is also believed that porcine high fever disease virus can persist in water, further contaminating the greens before harvest. The findings of this study suggest that unprocessed non-animal origin feed ingredients could be contaminated with virus by other animals with subsequent transmission to swine (16).",

The final logistical regression model showed that protecting feed and water sources, separation of sick and healthy pigs, and washing/disinfecting equipment were negatively associated (protective) with ASF infection. These findings indicate that preventing rodent access to feed sources and the use of commercial feeds, as opposed to swill feeding, were potentially protective measures in the farms studied (15).",

In respect to feed-to-pig transmission pathways, the authors referenced a European Commission (2014) epidemiological report in Latvia and Lithuania suggesting that fresh grass and seeds may have been contaminated by wild boar feces containing ASFV and transmitted the virus to domestic backyard pigs. A similar study focused on ASF in Latvia also suggested that feeding potentially contaminated (via wild boar) fresh grass or crops was a risk factor for ASF occurrence in backyard holdings; however, swill feeding could not be excluded as a source (19). A study conducted in Kenya in 1921 demonstrated that ASFV could be transmitted to pigs when they consumed infected feces and urine but failed to transmit when contaminated sweet potatoes or bananas were consumed (20). While several references were provided for documented transmission of ASFV to domestic pigs through feeding of swine-origin feed ingredients, there is limited data on the relationship of ASFV transmission and non-animal origin feed ingredients (17).",

There was statistically significant agreement on 29 exposure routes; the routes with the highest estimated probability of occurrence all involved disposal of waste to feral or backyard pigs.

Fasina et al. (15) identified feed and water control to be significantly associated with decreased risk of ASF infection in Nigeria, noting that feed and water biosecurity practices can prevent virus contamination by rodents and wild birds (15). Consistent with these findings, an expert opinion elicitation study conducted in Australia found industry representatives believed commercial pigs were most likely to be exposed to highly pathogenic PRRS through access to contaminated animal feed and feed additives imported from southeast Asia (18). These studies suggest that protecting unprocessed non-animal origin feed ingredients from contact with animals may decrease the likelihood of pathogen contamination.

The author suggests that the pathogenic forms of these viruses evolved out of the existing swine virome2, arguing that intensive single species food production systems along with globalization, intensification of production practices, and multiple movements of pigs within the production cycle have contributed to the geographic expansion of these viral agents and points to the likelihood that future emerging or re-emerging viruses in swine are likely to arise from already recognized (non-pathogenic or ignored) swine viruses.",

The authors used a cell culture based assay and model fitting to estimate a delta value, calculated as an indicator of the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. For the spiked samples incubated at room temperature, the greatest delta values were obtained for PDCoV and TGEV in soybean meal, at ~42 days each. Soybean meal at room temperature also provided the highest delta value for PEDV, at 7.5 days. Other findings indicated that at room temperature, moisture and ether content were important determinants of virus survival. The authors found no difference in virus survival in feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients incubated at temperatures higher than 70\u00b0C.

Collectively, the findings indicate that none of the source ingredients nor the outgoing feed at the feed mills sampled were positive for viral RNA, suggesting the non-animal origin ingredients and feed were not contaminated with PEDV or PDCoV. However, experimental studies by Trudeau et al. (33, 34) did show that feed ingredients, soybean meal in particular, spiked with PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in a laboratory setting could maintain live virus for a period of time at room temperature. The authors also found that different ingredients supported different virus survival periods which they believe may be due to differences in moisture content, ether content and/or pH of each ingredient. These data indicate that, under certain conditions, swine enteric coronaviruses are able to survive in feed ingredients (33, 34). However, these studies did not investigate nor were they able to demonstrate that virus present in feed could be transmitted to na\u00efve animals through normal feeding behavior.",

The piglets inoculated with the PEDV-positive feed samples along with the negative-control piglets remained negative for PEDV by PCR and clinically healthy throughout the study period. In contrast, only the positive-control piglets (Ct value = 25.5) developed clinical signs of PED. The authors provide several plausible explanations for the failure to demonstrate infectivity, including the nucleic acid detected in the feed samples did not represent infectious virus; the feed samples had relatively high Ct values (range: 30.0\u201336.5); and an extended storage time between collection of the sample and the bioassay may have reduced or eliminated the infectivity of the PEDV.

Additionally, the source facility (supplier) tested positive for PEDV as did individual ingredients at the source facility. Piglets were provided ad libitum access to the RT-PCR positive mash3 (mean Ct = 36.5) along with dry pellets from the same lot for 7 days and observed for clinical signs of PED. During the bioassay, none of the pigs developed clinical signs of disease and diagnostic tests were negative for PEDV (31). Explanations for the failure to demonstrate infectivity were similar to those provided by Pillatzki et al.

For the swine bioassay, piglets were divided into three groups: the treatment group; the positive-control group; and the negative-control group. Piglets were fed via natural feeding method. Clinical signs consistent with PED were observed in piglets in the treatment group and the positive-control group. At necropsy, rectal swabs and intestinal tract samples from the treatment group and the positive-control group were positive for PEDV by PCR and immunohistochemistry with evidence of microscopic lesions. In the negative group, clinical signs, viral shedding, or PEDV-positive intestinal tract samples were not observed.

The findings in three studies, under different experiment conditions, suggest that virus survival is ingredient-dependent. Varying physical and chemical characteristics of feed ingredients may enhance or protect virus survival. The feed ingredients that have shown to support virus survivability and viability include conventional soybean meal, lysine, choline chloride, and vitamin D (38, 39, 41). Of interest, Dee et al. (41) noted that PED virus viability in organic SBM could not be demonstrated. This finding could discount previous speculation that the rise in organic swine farming may have contributed to PEDV introduction in to the United States. The authors also noted that ASFV demonstrated strong survivability characteristics, remaining viable under laboratory-simulated conditions with or without the feed matrix. Similarly, Senecavirus A, the surrogate for foot-and-mouth disease virus, showed the highest degree of stability as viable virus was recovered from 10 of 11 ingredients (41). Both formaldehyde-based LA and MCFA treatment rendered virus inactive, regardless of ingredient type, suggesting these mitigants might be useful as part of a risk management strategy for reducing viral load in feed ingredients (38, 39).",

There is a lack of field data demonstrating whether, how, and when non-animal origin feed ingredients may become contaminated with swine viruses. Further, although some field epidemiological investigations have associated contaminated (PCR positive) feed with the source of virus introduction on affected farms, to date, experimental studies of virus transmission via feed and feed ingredients have yielded inconsistent data. Additionally, the development of diagnostic assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting small amounts of virus in large volumes of non-animal origin feed ingredients is necessary to allow more accurate estimation of the frequency with which these materials are contaminated with virus, which viruses are present, and, if present, at what concentrations. Subsequent assays to determine the level of virus in the final, processed feed product would be useful to estimate the likelihood that contaminated non-animal origin feed ingredients could serve as a transmission pathway for swine viruses and to what degree feed should be prioritized as a biosecurity risk.",

Similarly, the entry route for swine viruses into the United States may differ from the transmission route(s) among domestic swine farms. Thus, if swine viruses contaminate non-animal origin feed ingredients, a multi-modal transmission mechanism is likely to occur. When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as potential fomites for swine virus transmission, it is important to understand how the primary transmission pathways (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel) interface with one another, in particular, how the production and distribution of feed interacts with other potential or known sources of virus contamination (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel) to contribute to disease transmission both into and within the United States. Similarly, it's important to understand the relative risks of various transmission pathways and where feed ingredients fit in among broadly accepted risk pathways such as movement of infected pigs and fecal contamination of fomites (e.g., transport vehicles). By understanding the magnitude of the risk of feed ingredients, one can better balance the costs of sourcing \u201csafe\u201d feed ingredients and the nutritional needs of pigs with the costs of applying various mitigation strategies to potentially contaminated feed (e.g., heat or chemical treatment or feed holding times).",

Commercial swine operations may use the absence of PRRS on the farm as an indicator of thorough implementation and enforcement of biosecurity measures. In the studies reviewed, Bowman et al. (31) stated that the \u201ceffectiveness of the biosecurity measures in place was evidenced by the absence of PRRS cases.\u201d However, the entry of PEDV (and new or emerging swine viruses) onto presumably biosecure commercial premises suggests that current biosecurity standards may be insufficient to prevent certain virus incursions. Virus characteristics and the characteristics of the commercial swine industry, including globalization of trade, intensification and vertical integration of production, and extensive movement of pigs and related production components could contribute to biosecurity breaches. Robust biosecurity measures may be the only tool, in the absence of effective vaccines or treatments, to prevent the entry and spread of some diseases. Thus, biosecurity strategies, particularly the extensive movement of production inputs, need to be re-evaluated and adjusted to meet today's swine industry paradigm.",

A major knowledge gap exists in sources of potential contamination and where feed or feed ingredients may become cross-contaminated. Very little information is available on how non-animal origin feed ingredients are produced and sourced outside the United States and current studies have produced little scientific evidence of whether, how, or when non-animal origin feed ingredients become contaminated with swine viruses in regions outside the United States. The critical point(s) of susceptibility to contamination along the entire feed supply chain, from harvesting of plant-derived feed ingredients in the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine premises, have not been identified. To compound this issue, reliable and validated assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting small amounts of virus in large volumes (bulk) of non-animal origin feed ingredients are not available. Taking a systematic approach to the entire (transboundary) feed production system, similar to the hazard analysis and critical control points process used in food safety, may help to identify vulnerabilities in the production process, better inform the development and application of mitigation measures to reduce viral contamination risks, and help stakeholders allocate resources toward mitigation measures based on the likelihood of virus contamination.",

If the primary concern lies in the importation of contaminated feed and feed ingredients, then additional research and investigative studies of how ingredients are sourced, processed, and transported prior to importation are needed. However, the lack of validated feed and feed ingredient diagnostic assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting small amounts of virus in large volumes of material limits the ability to determine whether and at what point non-animal origin feed or feed ingredients may become contaminated with viruses and limits the ability to identify critical control points in feed production, distribution, and storage to mitigate risk. Although LA and MCFA were shown to be effective chemical mitigants against PEDV, additional mitigation strategies should continue to be explored, including other chemical treatments, the application of heat or pressure (pelleting) to feed, and holding times for feed or feed ingredients. Moving forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination in the feed supply chain and virus mitigation steps in processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.",
