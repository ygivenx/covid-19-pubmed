            "text": "By April 2009, the sever cases of pneumonia were occurred in Mexico which proceeded by influenza virus and then spread to North America. The cause of that pneumonia identified and noted which it quickly evolved into a pandemic (Van et al., 2009). Evidence that this strain could pass from human to human led the World Health Organization to quickly raise its pandemic alert level to Phase 6 on 11 June, 2009, it has since spread widely across the globe with substantial clinical impact (WHO, 2009). During the first wave of A (H1N1) influenza in Malaysia, 14,912 cases were reported from May 15, 2009 until Jun 4, 2010 and a total number of 88 deaths were recorded across the country in 2010 (Ministry of Health Malaysia; 2010). Effective pandemic management requires support from the population at risk for measures undertaken to mitigate the pandemic\u2019s spread. Previous studies during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 have shown that individual beliefs and perceptions play an important role in subsequent desired behavioral change (Tang and Wong, 2003; Lau et al., 2003). Higher perception on effectiveness of measures undertaken (Lau et al., 2003; Tang and Wong, 2004) and higher perceived threat of the disease led to higher rates of positive behavioral change, and better knowledge also increased the uptake of preventive measures (Leung et al., 2004; Leung et al., 2005). Similarly, in an anticipated H5N1 epidemic, these factors also influenced both self and community protective behavior (Lau et al., 2007) During the current influenza pandemic, studies have found that the individual\u2019s emotional status mediates behavioral response (Jones and Salathe, 2009)) and that perceived severity and susceptibility to disease and perceived effectiveness of specific behaviors resulted in the corresponding recommended behavior changes (Rubin et al., 2009; Seale et al., 2009). To increase positive perceptions, clear dissemination of information is vital to reduce misconceptions (Lau et al., 2009). It is therefore important to perform behavioral studies in different populations to understand the determinants that influence behaviors. However, there have been few studies (Mohd Shahriman et al., 2009; Zairina et al., 2011) on the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the influenza A pandemic in Malaysia. As such, there is a need to understand the factors influencing such behavioral changes to promote effective management of influenza A pandemics in this country. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) associated with complications of H1N1, effectiveness of treatment, preventive measures and health promotion of Influenza A (H1N1) among patients attending Klinik Kesihatan Jinjang in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2010.",

The questionnaire was adopted from previous studies done by researchers (Rubin et al., 2009; Goodwin et al., 2009), and was pilot tested among 30 patients from another clinic (Klinik Kesihatan Pantai) with similar profiles to prove its reliability. The questionnaire was consisted of 4 parts: A: demographic characteristics, B: knowledge C: attitudes and D: practices of participants using both open and close questions. The questionnaire collected information on basic demographic data on age, sex, ethnicity and education level as well as questions on knowledge, attitudes, and practices on pandemic influenza A (H1N1). Questions on knowledge were used to assess the respondent\u2019s general knowledge on pandemic influenza A and on the recommended preventive measures. Questions on attitudes were used to assess perceptions towards pandemic influenza A and these preventive measures. Questions on practices were used to assess the actual compliance and practices of these measures. Respondents\u2019 were asked to rate their agreement with the statements in the questionnaire, which were scored either yes/no or on a 4 point Likert scale.",

This study investigated the levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding H1N1 and should provide scientific support to assist health sector authorities\u2019 in developing strategies and health education campaigns to prevent transmission of H1N1. Guidelines and recommendations have been developed to prevent and control the spread of H1N1 during pandemic threat (WHO, 2009). Successful containment or control of pandemic influenza will rely on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission which requires a system for outbreak detection, rapid data collection, analysis, assessment and timely reporting.",

Similarly, the results indicated that gender, and educational level significantly associated with knowledge level that was also highlighted in the study done by Marshall (2009) in South Australia where women were found to be more likely than men to report high concerns about the threat of pandemic influenza A (H1N1). Janahi and his colleagues (2011) in Bahrain also reported that higher education and older age have positively correlated with an increase in the general knowledge about the virus and the disease. Both race and educational level were found to have been associated significantly with practices regarding H1N1 prevention.",

There was also significant association between knowledge and practices. Meanwhile, in a study done among Thai medical students, Wisedjinda (2009) reported that there was no significant correlation between knowledge and practices. The other researcher (Sukprasert et al., 2009) also stated that there was no significant association between knowledge and practices. There was also significant association between attitude and practices (p=0.001). This concurred with the findings of Wisedjinda (2009) and Zairina et al., (2011) confirming a significant association between attitude and practices. This study has some limitation as the study population was only confined to adults and limited in one health centre which its generalizability is questionable. Although results in this study are useful in pandemic preparedness, the community response may change over time as compared to the time of study. This study was a cross sectional survey and may not have been able to assess the true association between knowledge and practices. Thus future study with different study design should be considered for validation.",
