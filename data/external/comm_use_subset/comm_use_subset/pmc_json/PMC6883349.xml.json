One component of antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine is education of pet owners about indications for and dosing regimens of antimicrobials (1), with the goal of reducing inappropriate antimicrobial use and promoting acceptance of stewardship (2). While we recently found that pet owners generally have a great deal of trust in their veterinarians, particularly when it comes to prescribing antimicrobials, we also found that a small number of pet owners would challenge a veterinarian who said their pet did not need antibiotics (3).",

Another study noted a decrease in hospitalized patients' self-reported expectations for antibiotics after viewing a poster with an antimicrobial stewardship message (15), but the participants were specifically presented with and directed to read the poster rather than observing it on their own by chance.",

The surveys were administered in this sequence to avoid alerting participants to the topic of the poster when asking them to paraphrase its message. This second survey presented the participant with a series of questions related to statements from the poster (\u201cAntibiotics are only needed for treating infections in your pet caused by bacteria,\u201d \u201cSome bacterial infections in dogs and cats get better on their own, without antibiotics,\u201d and \u201cWhen antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help your pet, and the side effects could cause harm,\u201d Supplemental Document 1). Participants could answer \u201cTrue,\u201d \u201cFalse,\u201d or \u201cDon't know\u201d for these statements. A knowledge score was generated from these questions. One point was assigned for each correct true/false statement (i.e., an answer of \u201cTrue\u201d). To assess pet owners' background knowledge of antimicrobial resistance, the second survey also asked participants to define antibiotic resistance in their own words. A definition score was generated for the following components of the definition: (a) bacteria mentioned as the offending agents (1 point); (b) the drug is no longer effective in treating disease (1 point); (c) resistance is associated with antibiotic use (1 point), for a total possible of 3 points. Scores for the open-ended questions (e.g., paraphrasing of the message of the poster and definition of antibiotic resistance) were assigned by both authors independently. If there was disagreement between the authors, the average of the two scores was assigned. Kappa values were calculated to assess agreement between the two scorers. A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the agreement between the knowledge score and the definition score.",

The stated goal of the AVMA posters was to \u201chelp explain why your clients' animals don't need antibiotics for most ailments\u201d (16). A presumed desired outcome of this poster and other posters with a similar message is to decrease the incidence of clients requesting antibiotics or increase pet owners' acceptance of a veterinarian's decision not to prescribe antibiotics when they are not necessary. The assumptions underlying such objectives are that clients do in fact pressure veterinarians to prescribe antibiotics, that they will see a poster and retain its message, and that this newly acquired information will change their behavior. However, it is very difficult to measure such an outcome. We did not have access to information on the number of antimicrobial prescriptions in participating clinics and we could not assess pet owners' propensity to request antibiotics. We therefore measured the actions that would occur \u201cupstream\u201d of a poster-induced change in behavior with regards to antibiotic prescribing\u2014actual viewing of the poster and retention of its message. We also sought to determine whether people who noticed the poster were more likely to be able to correctly answer questions relating to its content. While we could not assess pet owners' baseline knowledge of or expectations for antibiotics prior to the first survey without alerting them to the message of the poster, we did use a proxy measure of baseline knowledge by asking them to define antibiotic resistance in their own words. Finally, we assessed whether veterinarians perceived a change in how frequently they discussed the topic of antimicrobial resistance with clients or felt pressured to prescribe antibiotics while the poster was up.",

The significant association between antibiotic knowledge and education on univariable analysis but not on multivariable analysis is likely due to the fact that we were underpowered to detect the true adjusted effect: because only 83 participants completed both surveys and provided a definition of antibiotic resistance, the sample size for the multivariable analysis was smaller than the sample size for the univariable analysis.",

Moreover, it is still questionable how widespread the undesirable behavior that the poster is presumably intended to address (pressuring veterinarians for antibiotics) is. In contrast to what was anecdotally reported by veterinarians in this study (i.e., that they are often pressured to prescribe antibiotics), other studies suggest that pressuring of veterinarians for antibiotics by pet owners occurs infrequently (3, 5) and that there is a dissonance between perceptions of veterinarians and pet owners with regard to expectations for antibiotics (5), similar to that documented in pediatrics (8, 22). Nevertheless, a poster could be useful in providing an inexpensive and simple vehicle for the passive absorption of a message of judicious antibiotic use, even if it only reaches 9% of pet owners. Moreover, one of the veterinarians reported finding the poster useful as a reminder to discuss the issue of judicious antibiotic use more frequently with her clients. Such visual material could therefore be useful under certain circumstances. However, because antimicrobial resistance tends to be a nebulous and future threat that is often discounted in the face of more immediate concerns (23), pet owners may not pay heed to such a message when concerned about their pets' health, and veterinarians might be reticent to cede valuable exam room wall \u201creal estate\u201d to such a poster. The skepticism expressed by all of the veterinary personnel in this study that the poster was effective underscores this possibility. Future studies are needed to investigate the best practices for veterinarians to initiate conversations with clients about antimicrobial resistance.",

In fact, the guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America for implementing antimicrobial stewardship programs in human settings include a recommendation against solely relying on didactic, passive education as an approach to improving antimicrobial use (25). The recommendations suggest that education is best combined with other approaches such as prospective audit and feedback of providers. Several studies have shown that multimodal approaches to patient/pet owner and clinician education can decrease antimicrobial prescribing (26\u201328) and improve patient (29) and pet owner (30) satisfaction. However, additional studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of such multimodal approaches in the specific context of antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine.",

First, only a small number of participants from each clinic enrolled, despite the monetary incentive for participation, the simplicity of participation, and the lengthy time period during which the poster was in place. We do not know what proportion of pet owners visiting the clinics our numbers represent, as the participating clinics were either unable or unwilling to provide us with the total number of pet owners who visited their clinics during the study. We therefore do not know how representative the sample of study participants was. However, it is likely that the small sample size limits the generalizability of the results of the study, might have introduced selection bias, and might not accurately reflect the true number of people who saw the poster and retained its message. Second, we do not know the reasons why pet owners were at the clinic (e.g., sick visits vs. preventive care) or whether they were prescribed antibiotics during their visit, and pet owners may have been more or less likely to view the poster and retain its message based on these factors. Third, the use of true/false questions to assess a participant's knowledge of antibiotics after viewing the poster could result in artificially high scores if people guessed the answers correctly. Fourth, a participant's definition of antibiotic resistance might not be an accurate reflection of their \u201cbackground\u201d knowledge, especially if a person looked up the definition prior to answering the question. Fifth, the posters were up during the spring and summer (March-August), whereas respiratory disease in dogs and cats tends to occur in the fall and winter (31, 32). Owners may therefore not have perceived the message of the poster as relevant and might have been less likely to remember it. Finally, we did not know how long pet owners waited to complete the survey after their visit. If the interval between the visit and completion of the survey was large, recall of the poster's message could have been affected. Future studies are needed to investigate other methods of presenting antimicrobial stewardship material to pet owners and to evaluate whether they can effect change in behavior.",

We suggest that posters might have some utility if they are a part of an active, multi-modal education campaign that could also involve, as suggested by the veterinarians in this study, brochures, educational stories, and video material (12, 34, 35). Such a strategy is even more likely to be successful if it is coupled with stewardship actions conducted by the veterinarian (35).",
