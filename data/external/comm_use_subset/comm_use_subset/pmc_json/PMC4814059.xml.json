Previous studies have attributed the etiology of acute viral respiratory infections in Cambodia to rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus A and B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), bocavirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus [2]. Influenza has been described to be one of the most important causes for hospitalization of children with an ARI [3]. It was suggested that some Southeast Asian countries, where influenza A infection is present year round, play an important role in the global spread of influenza that could trigger annual epidemics in temperate regions [4,5].",

Since then, the sentinel surveillance system has, together with event-based surveillance, demonstrated evidence of seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza. Previously published data revealed that Thailand and Cambodia, which are positioned geographically in the Northern hemisphere, demonstrate differing influenza epidemiology with regard to seasonality, with Thailand exhibiting a northern hemisphere transmission pattern while transmission in Cambodia typically occurs from June to December, similar to the southern hemisphere [6]. The rainy season in Western Cambodia is June to November and the dry season is December to May. The more recent data suggests that influenza seasonality is more similar in Thailand and Cambodia than previously thought. [5].",

The antigenic sites are five somewhat overlapping regions (designated A to E for the H3 strains [9\u201311] and Ca1, Ca2, Cb, Sa, and Sb for the H1 strains [12]). Antigenic mapping by Smith et al. [13] showed that 11 antigenic clusters of viruses emerged during the 35-year period following the introduction of the A/H3N2 virus in humans in 1968 and that major jumps (or \"cluster transitions\") occur between antigenically distinct clusters of viral sequences roughly every 3 years (antigenic shift) [13].",

The concentration of drug required to inhibit 50% of the NA activity (IC50) was calculated using the non-linear curve-fitting function in the Graphpad Prism 4 package (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The average IC50 (nM) (\u00b1 standard deviation) of two independent determinations was calculated for each virus. Outliers of more than 2 standard deviations from the overall mean were retested twice. A subset of isolates were forwarded to WHOCC in Melbourne for confirmation of strain analysis by HA inhibition test and NA inhibitor susceptibility using an NA enzyme inhibition assay with a fluorescent substrate MUNANA [2\u2019-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-\u03b1-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate]. The typical range of IC50 was calculated as the mean IC50 \u00b1 3 standard deviations using a panel of well-characterized reference strains kindly provided by the WHO Collaborative Center for Reference and Research on Influenza, Melbourne, Australia. Isolates with IC50 values within or close to the typical IC50 range were considered to be sensitive isolates. IC50 values outside of the typical range and between 50 and 200 nM were isolates with mildly reduced sensitivity and IC50 values well outside the typical range and greater than 200 nM were considered as isolates with highly reduced sensitivity.",

Single-step first-round RT-PCR was performed in following mix: 5 \u03bcl RNA suspension, 5 \u03bcl of 10x PCR buffer II supplied with AmliTaqTM DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 pmol of each forward and reverse primer (EV71-VP1f and EV71-VP1r), 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 U reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV RT, Promega, Madison, WI), 1.25 U of AmpliTaqTM DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. The reverse transcription (RT) step was performed at 42\u00b0C for 60 min, followed by 35 cycles of thermocycling 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds.",

EV/RV-2n was modified from primer 2-EV/RV [29] for using in nested PCR reaction. Single-step first-round RT-PCR reaction was the same as described above except that 0.25 pmol of each forward and reverse primer (1-EV/RV and 2-EV/RV) was used (S3 Table). The RT step was performed at 42\u00b0C for 60 min, followed by 35 cycles of thermocycling 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. The reaction was further incubated at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Five micro-liter of 1:20 diluted first round PCR products were added to the nested PCR reaction with the same reagents as in the first-round but without DTT and AMV-RT and the primers were 0.25 pmol of each forward and reverse primer, 3-EV/RV and EV/RV-2n. The reaction was incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of thermocycling 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 52\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. The PCR products (9 \u03bcl each) were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gels, with 100-bp DNA ladder serving as a molecular marker. A negative control of RNA-free water and a positive control of cDNA template from the EV71 reference strain (ATCC\u00ae No. VR-1432TM) were included in each experiment.",

When compared to the A/California/7/2009 vaccine strain, all Cambodian viruses on average had 11 amino acid changes within the HA segment. Amino acid changes found in the HA gene can be found in Table 4. No evidence for amino acid substitutions leading to changes in glycosylation was seen in the HA dataset; however, several changes among sequenced samples occurred in antigenic sites, polymorphic sites or had a recorded effect in in vitro analyses per the literature (S6 Table). For the NA gene, several amino acid substitutions resulted in addition/loss of glycosylation sites, or were found in polymorphic or antigenic sites (epitopes) (S6 Table). For the MP gene, all samples contained the S31N mutation that may confer amantadine resistance as determined by the Genbank Influenza Viral Resource Annotation tool [32]. No features or changes of interest were seen within the NP or NS segment. The HA and NA segments contained the most amino acid substitutions when compared to the reference (A/California/7/2009) as well as to the yearly defined groups (2011 and 2012). The MP and NP segments showed the fewest substitutions (Table 4). There were no samples within the HA amino acid analysis that had unique substitutions relative to the global sequences. However, the NA gene had unique amino acid substitutions not found with the global references; the function of these substitutions is unknown (S7 Table). Selection pressure was determined using the dN/dS statistic. Values of dN/dS > 1 are indicative of positive or adaptive selection, values <1 are indicative of purifying or negative selection and a value = 1 indicates neutral or no selection ongoing in the dataset. All samples were under purifying selection for all segments with exception to the NS segment of the 2011 Cambodian samples, which had a dN/dS value of 1.0 suggesting neutral selection (S8 Table).",

Available influenza vaccines during the study period were the A(H1N1)2009pdm monovalent vaccine in the public sector and the trivalent seasonal vaccine in 2009, 2010 and 2011 in the private sector [39]. Our data revealed that the influenza B did not match well with strains included in vaccine composition of trivalent vaccines; therefore, if vaccination is to be implemented, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine that contains the two influenza B lineages, rather than the trivalent vaccine, may be more suitable. Aside from a limited quantity of oseltamivir, stockpiled by the government for management of severe disease by pandemic or avian influenza [40], use of antivirals for influenza is very low in Cambodia [40]. As a result, all strains we detected were susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, which can be partially explained by the absence of these medications in Cambodia. Due to widespread adamantane resistance, we did not conduct susceptibility testing on this class of antiviral drugs; however, we did find the S31N mutation conferring adamantane resistance in all of our influenza isolates tested.",

This is likely an underestimation of the true prevalence in this population since we excluded children less than one year of age, an age group more likely infected by enteroviruses at rates exceeding those of older children and adults by several fold [48\u201350].

Coxsackievirus A6 is known to cause either an atypical rash resembling eczema herpeticum or chickenpox (United States 2011\u20132012 and in Europe since 2009) or nail loss one to two months after onset of symptoms (Finland 2009, Taiwan 2010, Japan 2011).

While we attempted to select surveillance sites representative of the nearby geographic locations, we had no accurate figures of the catchment populations or denominators at our respective sentinel sites. Our staggered method of adding sentinel sites suggests that not all sentinel sites enrolled patients evenly over 3 influenza seasons. Similarly, with a small sample size and limited number of sampling locations, no inferences could be made with regard to temporal or spatial flow of influenza strains in our phylogenetic analysis.
