            "text": "High fat diet (HFD) could induce hepatic steatosis, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes and other lipid metabolism disorder disease by regulating signal pathway of lipid metabolism in livers [1,2]. AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), a phylogenetically conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, is a key regulator of energy metabolic homeostasis and a crucial target for drugs both ancient and modern [3]. Activation of AMPK can play an important role in regulating energy balance and nutrient metabolism, such as the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, glucose, and hepatic gluconeogenesis and translation. Moreover, AMPK is considered an attractive target for the prevention of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, inflammation and cancer [3,4]. It is reported that AMPK could be activated by natural phenolic compound, such as resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), curcumin, quercetin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), berberine, and theaflavin [4].",

            "text": "Indigenous medicinal plants have been recommended for treatment of many metabolism diseases because of their easy availability and relatively fewer side effects [1,3,5]. Epidemiological studies revealed that an increased daily intake of phenolic compounds in dietary supplements act as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agents to increase thermogenesis and energy expenditure while decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, further supporting progress towards decreased metabolic disorders [1,5]. Previous studies confirmed that the species of the genus Paulownia (belonging to the family scrophulariaceae) exhibited a broad spectrum of biological effects, including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic [6,7], antiphlogistic [8], antiviral [9], antimicrobial [10] and anti-cholinesterase activities [11]. Paulownia fortunei (Seem.) Hemsl. is a fast growing ornamental tree, native to Mainland China and distributed almost all over the world [10]. This species is renowned as a polyphenol rich plant, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of hypertension, enteritis, tonsillitis, bronchitis and dysentery [7,12,13]. The flowers of P. fortunei are also used as an additive to seasonal foods in China, made into a local delicacy called \u201cZheng Cai\u201d. Previous studies have shown that flower extracts of P. fortunei (EPF) contain high amounts of flavonoids, which are mainly composed of apigenin, luteolin, hesperetin, \u03b2-sitosterol, thunberginol A, daucosterol, quercetin, kaempferol, and their derivatives [12,13]. In previous study, we showed that flavonoid puerarin could prevent hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress and other lipid metabolism disorder disease in livers [14,15]. For these reasons, we hypothesized that the extract from P. fortunei flowers (EPF) might play an important role in protecting HFD-induced hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation. In this study, for the first time, we used high-fat diet induced obese mice to verify the protective effects of ethanol extract of P. fortunei flowers containing the flavonoids and to study the mechanisms focusing on these effects in enhancing AMPK signaling pathway and inhibiting lipid metabolism disorder in livers.

The carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) expression level was also decreased in the livers of HFD group as compared with the control group. Interestingly, EPF supplementation significantly enhanced the CPT1 expression in the livers of HFD group (p < 0.01). ",

Moreover, increased insulin secretion is in part related to pancreatic islet hyperplasia with progression of insulin-resistance by HFD supply [5,22]. In the present study, we found that blood glucose, insulin levels and HOMA-IR increased significantly (p \u2264 0.05) in the HFD group compared to the control group, revealing insulin resistance in the HFD group (Table 3). Furthermore, this rising blood glucose levels may be attributed to the large accumulation of fat in the liver and the enhancement of gluconeogenesis induced by hepatic cells, reducing the transformation of glucose into fat caused by lipodystrophy [27,28]. However, EPF supplementation in HFD-induced obesity mice for eight weeks markedly ameliorated insulin resistance conditions, as indicated by lower serum glucose and insulin levels at the end of the experiment compared to the HFD group, which is thought to stimulate the pancreatic insulin secretion from the \u03b2 cells of the islets of langerhans and aldose reductase enzyme inhibitory activity [20]. The rich flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, rutin and hesperetin) in EPF might play important role in the anti-obesity and hypoglycemic effects [24,29,30]. The decreased insulin levels in mice supplied with EPF may be attributed to reduced body weight gain and fat accumulation in livers. Moreover, the protective effects of EPF against obesity and lipid accumulation could also be attributed to the prevention of hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia in mice fed with HFD. Thus, EPF could inhibit insulin-resistance or conduce to the classical diabetes mellitus treatment.",

Present observations are in agreement with previous demonstrations that HFD increased the levels of TG, TC and LDL-C [33,34]. Interestingly, EPF treatment markedly decreased serum TC, TG and LDL levels and increased HDL levels in HFD mice after eight weeks, which suggested that flavonoids might be the main bioactive compounds in EPF that exhibited the beneficial effects on the lipid profile (Table 3). Furthermore, the digestion and intestinal absorption of the flavonoids apigenin, luteolin, quercetin and hesperetin from EPF might lower hepatic lipid accumulation suppressing hepatic lipogenesis and lipid absorption [29,30,31]. We observed that EPF treatment significantly decreased liver weight and liver triglyceride content of mice in a dose-dependent manner. Histological analysis showed that EPF supplementation markedly reduced lipid vacuoles and lipid droplets in livers of HFD-fed mice (Figure 1), consistent with liver TG content. ",

Many studies showed that several natural compounds, including resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, berberine, and quercetin could inhibit lipid-related metabolic disorders by regulating the AMPK activition and its target genes [3,4,19]. In this study, EPF markedly stimulated the AMPK activation in livers of mice and in HepG2 cells (Figure 2 and Figure 3). This result suggested that AMPK pathway may be involved in the modulation of hepatic lipid metabolism in livers of HFD-fed mice and HepG2 cells treated with EPF. Consistent with this regulation, the AMPK inhibitor compound C blocked the effects of EPF on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, demonstrating that AMPK activation is necessary for the modulation of hepatic lipid metabolism (Figure 4).

Previous report showed that AMPK coordinates the long-term adaptation of lipid metabolism by regulating the transcriptional factor SREBP-1c (a key transcription factor involved in the control of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis), which further increase the transcription of FAS and SCD-1, resulting in an increase in the synthesis of TG [3,4,19,35]. Several studies have demonstrated that the flavonoid extracted from plants could inhibit lipid-related metabolic disorders by regulating the expression levels of AMPK and SREBP-1c and their target genes [1,22,29,36]. As demonstrated in our Western blot analysis, EPF supplementation significantly down-regulated the expression levels of AMPK and SREBP-1c and their target gene HMGCR, an endoplasmic reticulum bound and peroxisomal enzyme that is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, suggesting that EPF had a positive effect due to the lower expression of HMGCR and contributed to inhibit the serum cholesterol increase due to high fat diet (Figure 5). Moreover, EPF treatment significantly down-regulated the expression level of FAS, a key enzymes involved in lipogenesis and up-regulated the expression level of carnitine palmitoil transferase 1 (CPT1), which catalyzes the entrance of fatty acids into the mitochondria and it is the rate limiting enzyme of hepatic fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (Figure 5). Therefore, these results implied that the reduced biosynthesis and enhanced fatty acid oxidation might contribute to the beneficial effects of EPF on hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in the HFD mice. These data explained the anti-obesity, hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effects of EPF to a certain extent.",

            "text": "As previously expressed, insulin resistance is another key pathophysiological feature and pathogenesis in high fat diet mice [2,20,21]. The hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia induced by high fat diet could decrease the number of insulin receptors, glucose transport and metabolism thereby increasing insulin resistance and reducing insulin sensitivity [23]. Insulin signaling is a cascade of events initiated by the activation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS). AMPK could regulate glucose metabolism insulin resistance by IRS pathway [37]. Insulin resistance could also decrease the AMPK phosphorylation and increase the expression levels of SREBP-1c, which further suppressed IRS-1 activation, inhibits IRS-1-associated insulin signaling and thereby decreases glucose uptake and utilization [3,4,19,38]. To understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to insulin resistance, we further observed the effects of EPF supplementation on these key factors of insulin signaling in liver tissue (Figure 6). Consistent with these reports, our results showed HFD feeding for 8 weeks increased the SREBP-1c expression levels and inhibited its downstream molecule IRS-1 (Ser 307) phosphorylation, which substantiates the development of insulin resistance in the livers of mice. However, EPF dietary supplementation partially or completely prevented all these alterations associated with HFD consumption, suggesting that EPF might be a natural flavonoid-rich extract and the activator of IRS-1, which in turn regulates the expression of downstream genes involved in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism to lower blood glucose and lipid.",
