            "text": "Emerging and re-emerging diseases caused by infectious pathogens are identified almost every year and remain a continuous threat to public health. Recent examples include influenza, avian flu, dengue, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), with the latest being microcephaly caused by the zika virus1. To combat these epidemics, vaccines are consistently needed for the purpose of disease control and prevention. A critical step in vaccine development is to characterize the antigenicity difference among various pathogens so as to select or design proper immunogens that are able to raise cross-protective immunity. To date, determining antigenic variation of the emerging pathogens has relied heavily on the results from the immune-binding assays. For instance, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is traditionally performed to determine the antigenic changes in circulating influenza viruses from those of the previous vaccines2. Antisera from multiple donors are routinely screened for binding against virus strains in search of a potential broad-spectrum antibody for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)3\u20135. Recently, comprehensive serological tests were accomplished on both animals and vaccinated or infected humans to calibrate the serological relationships between the subtypic dengue viruses (DENV)6. Despite the wide adoption for common infectious diseases, immune-based experiments are often found to exhibit limited application in the case of significant outbreaks or emergence of new virus subtypes, owing to various factors of mobility, antiserum dilution, standardization, and automation. Thus, new automated technologies with high-throughput and quick response are always desired, so as to meet the increasing demand of newly emerging epidemics. Accordingly, the development of computational strategies independent of immunoassays may be helpful for assisting the antigenicity measurement in a rapid and timely manner.",

In the adaptive humoral immune system, the pathogenic antigens will be recognized and bound by specific antibodies at the conformational epitopes generally comprising several segments that are discontinuous in sequence, but close in three-dimensional (3D) conformation10,11. This recognition process features high sensitivity and specificity, where only the mutated antigens with highly similar conformational epitopes are able to cross-react with the same antibody. Arising mutants with substantially different conformational epitopes are likely the causing antigenic variants to previous vaccines, and may lead to new outbreaks in the community12\u201314. Therefore, comparing the conformational epitopes directly may provide clues to infer antigenic similarity of the pathogenic antigens. This algorithm takes complete consideration of the structural and the physicochemical microenvironment variations from a 3D viewpoint caused by mutations, which are summarized into a comprehensive fingerprint for each epitope residue. For each input antigen with the structure information, the conformational epitope will be translated into a series of fingerprints and compared with the predefined or user-uploaded datasets through CE-BLAST, then a list of hit-epitope structures with predicted similarity scores will be provided in descending order as output.",

It is initially tested with intra-subtypic pathogen data of influenza A/H3N2 antigen including 3867 historical HI assays, and then combined with the experimental validation on a new antigen of A/H3N2. Then, its ability to classify serological relationships is further confirmed on DENV subtypes via 1072 serological data results. Notably, the application scope of CE-BLAST is extended to a cross-virus case to suggest the potential cross-reactive epitopes between ZIKV and DENV in the Flavivirus family. For convenient use, a web server has been constructed with built-in epitope libraries containing simulated structure databases of the HA antigen for influenza virus (A/H1N1 & A/H3N2), Envelope (E) antigen for DENV and ZIKV, and known conformational epitopes derived from the Protein Databank (PDB) immune complex.

In the first step, the epitope fingerprints are composed of individual fingerprints of each epitope residue, which are described by the residual layout and the physicochemical properties of the residual microenvironment via spin-image and shell-structure models. In the second step, a \u201cseed-grow\u201d strategy is subsequently adopted to identify the best local alignment, according to the fingerprint comparison between conformational epitopes. In the third step, the similarity score considers not only the number of matched residues, but also the evolutional distance between matched positions, as well as the similarity of the corresponding microenvironments for each residue. CE-BLAST begins with conformational epitope structures and requires no experimental binding data. Such unsupervised performance ensures its adaptability for new antigens without prior assays.

As shown in Fig. 2, the overall prediction abilities of the supervised models varied differently across different dates, with AUC value below 0.65 at the beginning of testing period in 1972. When the size of training data kept increasing, their performances become relatively stable with AUC value over 0.8 after 1992. In comparison, CE-BLAST gave high performance of AUC value of around 0.9 from the beginning of 1972, and maintained a consistently high and stable AUC value across the entire testing periods. As an unsupervised method, the prominent value of CE-BLAST appears to be able to process the fast antigenic matching of new antigens where no appropriate serology exists.

After querying against the 679 HA epitopes described above, CE-BLAST gave a potential similarity profile, with the protection spectrum of Con H3 shown in pink in Fig. 3a. Then, seven strains (Supplementary Table 1) including three inside and four outside of the predicted protection spectrum were randomly selected for experimental validation. Sequence comparison between \u201cCon H3\u201d and the seven selected strains can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2. Notably, all the Con H3-immunized mice (5 mice per group) mounted significant neutralization activities against the three strains inside the protection spectrum, yielding geometric mean titer (GMT) values of 12,150 against WI05 H3 (A/Wisconsin/67/2005), 2786 against BR07 H3 (A/Brisbane/10/2007), and 2111 against FJ02 H3 (A/Fujian/2002).

After removing the un-interpretable data with undone and self-reactive titers <10, the remaining titer data of 1072 strain pairs were included as our validation set. We modeled 47 E protein structures for CE-BLAST according to the sequences provided in the paper6. Unlike for influenza, no empirical titer threshold has been reported as being able to classify the antigenic similarity or variance for DENV cases. According to the statistics of the available data6, the titer value for over 90% of the self-reactive pairs was over 20. Thus, three different values of 15, 20, and 40 were tentatively chosen as classification thresholds for further testing. Accordingly, the classification results of CE-BLAST achieved AUC values of 0.857, 0.894, and 0.899, respectively, of the 1072 strain pairs.",

Our prediction is strongly corroborated by experimental results from either 1 month or 3 month post-infection sera. The titer value of DENV1-V1937 vs. DENV1-T16007 is the highest among all pairs between DENV1-V1937 and the 47 tested strains, followed by DENV1-M61117 with the second highest titer values, indicating the close antigenicity between DENV1-V1937 and DENV1-T16007 (Supplementary Data 1).

In this study, we designed a unique model to achieve such prediction by comparing the conformational epitopes of different antigens. Comprehensive validations confirmed the high and stable performance of CE-BLAST. The explanation for the success of CE-BLAST in sensitively detecting the antigenic change lies in the design of the algorithm. Firstly, the 3D residual layout difference in the whole antigen structure caused by mutations can be recorded by different rotating planes of spin-images of each epitope residue. Similarly, the physicochemical change of the microenvironment caused by the mutation in whole antigen can also be described through shell models of each epitope residue. Thus, for a pair of antigen structures with only one residual difference in the surface epitope, the coordinate displacement derived from classical structure alignment might mainly focus on the local mutated site, and therefore is usually minor. Conversely, in the CE-BLAST model, the fingerprints of all the non-mutated epitope residues will also change accordingly. Coupled with the substantial penalty from the BLOSUM matrix, the sensitivity to measure the overall difference is thereby largely increased in CE-BLAST.",

As our similarity score is normalized by self-size, the score of epitope A querying against B may be different from that of B against A, if they have different sizes. Therefore, we tested reciprocally in the case of ZIKV and DENV. A general workflow was also proposed for cross virus reactivation by modeling the representative antigen structures. Surface patches are artificially rendered as circles for simple calculation when the shape of the real epitope is totally unknown. Highly cross-reactive patches often suggest the inclusion of more cross-reactive epitope residues. After overlapping the individual residues from cross-reactive patches, the subtype-specific and subtype-common CREs can be suggested.",

As CE-BLAST calculates the similarity based on antigen structures, incomplete structures will reduce its performance. In addition, heavy post-translational modified structures may also influence the accuracy, such as in the case of the gp120 antigen of HIV. To summarize, we designed a new algorithm for the possible inference of antigenicity similarity, particularly for newly emerged pathogens. CE-BLAST may potentially be useful for the following applications: (1) inferring the relative antigenic distance between the mutated antigens, (2) predicting serological classification for pathogen subtypes, and (3) suggesting the potential cross-reactivity across viruses. Subsequent improvements will be further elaborated on post-translational modification (PTM) antigens, parallel computing, and refined models that are tailor-made for specific proteins.",
