Combined, they can make each pathogen\u2019s emergence seem idiosyncratic. In spite of this apparent particularity, there is a recent literature on the possibility of anticipating epidemic transitions using model-independent metrics [6\u201314]. Referred to as early-warning signals (EWS), these metrics are summary statistics (e.g. the variance and autocorrelation) which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. In addition to infectious disease transmission, EWS have been investigated for transitions in a broad range of dynamical systems, including ecosystem collapse and climate change [15\u201321]. The motivation for EWS comes from the theories of dynamical systems and stochastic processes, in particular the slowing down that universally occurs in the vicinity of dynamical critical points [22\u201324]. Theoretical results for disease emergence are promising, and suggest that the transition from limited stuttering chains of transmission (R0 < 1) to sustained transmission and outbreaks (R0 > 1) is preceded by detectable EWS [8, 13, 14].",

            "text": "A major obstacle to deploying early-warning systems is the type of data available to calculate the EWS. Theoretical predictions assume the data will be sequential recordings (or \u201csnapshots\u201d) of the true number of infected in the population through time [8\u201313]. In this paper we refer to this as snapshots data. However, epidemiological data originate instead from notifications by public health practitioners whenever a new case is identified. Public health bodies aggregate individual cases into regular case reports (e.g. the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report), as shown in Fig 1. Different combinations of serial interval (difference in time of symptom onset between primary and secondary cases) and aggregation period lead to time series which have very different appearances. Even assuming perfect reporting, variability in both the incubation period and onset of clinical symptoms mean that snapshots data cannot be reconstructed from case report data. In addition to aggregation, case reports are subject to reporting error (see Fig 2). Underreporting may occur due to asymptomatic infection, poorly implemented notification protocols, or socio-political factors [25\u201329]. Misdiagnoses and clerical errors in the compilation of reports can result in both under- and over-reporting [30\u201332]. Due to self reporting and contact tracing, once an index case has been positively identified secondary cases are more likely to be diagnosed, which may lead to clustering in case reports. The combination of case aggregation and reporting error results in a mismatch between snapshots and imperfect epidemiological data. EWS, such as the variance (Fig 3, top panel), are affected by imperfect data (Fig 3, bottom panel) and may not display the characteristic trends that form the basis for detecting disease emergence. This provides reason to question the direct application of EWS to observed data.",

We simulated a stochastic SIR model of a pathogen emerging via increasing R0, and corrupted the simulated case reports by applying a negative binomial reporting error. The area under the curve (AUC) statistic was computed to quantify how well trends in an EWS identify emergence. We find that performance depends on both the EWS and the reporting model. Broadly, the mean, variance, index of dispersion and first differenced variance perform well. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well unless either i) the data are highly overdispersed or ii) the aggregation period is less than the infectious period. The coefficient of variation, kurtosis, and skewness have a more subtle dependence on the reporting model, and are not reliable. We conclude that seven of ten EWS perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios.",

The model compartments and parameters are listed in Table 1. Transition rates and effects are listed in Table 2. The basic reproductive number for the SIR model is R0(t) = \u03b2(t)/(\u03b3+ \u03b1), where \u03b2(t) varies due to nondescript secular trends in the transmissibility. Simulated data are generated using the Gillespie algorithm [33], which simulates a sequence of transition events (infection, recovery, birth and death), and returns the number of individuals in each model compartment through time. The SIR simulations are of a population with average size N0 = 106. The parameter \u03b6 gives the rate at which new cases arise due to external sources, and is set to \u03b6 = 1 per week. The death rate, \u03b1, is the reciprocal of the life expectancy, set to 70 years. Case counts, Ct, are given by the number of recovery events (at rate \u03b3It) within each aggregation period, and are included in the model as an additional variable (see Table 1).",

We consider additional indicators to those most frequently studied in the EWS literature (the variance, autocorrelation and coefficient of variation). As R0 approaches 1, the mean number of cases caused by introductions rises, making it a potential EWS. The index of dispersion is a similar measure to the coefficient of variation, and is defined as the variance to mean ratio. The decay time (or correlation time) is a log-transform of the autocorrelation, which diverges as R0 approaches 1 (the definition of critical slowing down). In addition to the autocorrelation, which is normalized by the variance, we consider the unnormalized autocovariance. As both the autocorrelation and variance increase, the autocovariance may outperform these two measures. Theoretical results show the increase in variance accelerates as R0 approaches 1, suggesting the first differenced variance as a complementary EWS. Additionally we investigate the performance of two higher-order moments, the skewness and kurtosis.",

The BDI process is a one-dimensional stochastic process, depending only on the number of infected It, and possesses an exact mathematical solution (for full details see [13]). This allows expressions for the moments and correlation functions of It to be found (Table 3, fourth column). BDI theory predicts that most EWS (the mean, variance, index of dispersion, autocovariance, decay time and first differenced variance) are expected to grow hyperbolically as R0 approaches one. The autocorrelation is expected to grow exponentially, the kurtosis quadratically and the skewness linearly. The coefficient of variation is the only EWS which does not grow, instead remaining constant. We propose observing these trends in data as a basis for anticipating disease emergence. The numerical estimators used in this paper are listed in Table 3, third column, discussed in more depth below.",

The focus of this paper is to examine the robustness of each EWS to reporting process parameters, using simulated case report data, Kt. BDI theory predicts that 9 out of 10 EWS increase as the transition is approached. We quantify the association of each EWS with time using Kendall\u2019s rank correlation coefficient [19]. A coefficient close to (+/\u2212)1 implies consistent increases/decreases of the EWS in time. As the underlying dynamics of the case reports are stochastic, the value of the rank correlation coefficient is itself a random variable. Multiple simulations of the test (emerging) and null (stationary/not emerging) scenarios result in two distributions of correlation coefficients for each EWS. We measure performance using the AUC statistic, defined as the overlap of the two distributions, and may be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen test coefficient is higher than a randomly chosen null coefficient, AUC = P(\u03c4test > \u03c4null) [39, 40]. The name comes from one method of calculating it, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, a parametric plot of the false positive rate against true positive rate as the decision threshold is varied [41].",

To examine the practical consequences of this mismatch between theory and data, in this paper we calculated EWS from case report data. We performed extensive numerical simulations to determine the sensitivity of each candidate EWS to imperfect data. Case aggregation and reporting error change the statistical properties of the data, and can have subtle effects on an EWS\u2019s performance. We identified four groups of EWS based on their sensitivity to the various reporting process parameters. The performance of one group, consisting of the EWS with either polynomial or no growth with R0, has a nuanced relationship with the reporting process parameters. We therefore conclude that the coefficient of variation, kurtosis and skewness perform poorly as EWS. In general, the other EWS (the mean, variance, first differenced variance, index of dispersion, autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time) all performed well and are strong candidates for incorporation in monitoring systems intended to provide early warning of disease emergence.",

The coefficient of variation, kurtosis and skewness perform best when both reporting probability and overdispersion are low. At first glance this result appears counter-intuitive: as an increasingly large fraction of cases are missed, performance improves. The point to stress here is that by changing the parameters of the reporting process we are systematically changing the statistical properties of the time series. For instance, the BDI process predicts no trend in the coefficient of variation, due to the standard deviation and mean increasing with R0 at an identical rate [13]. With aggregation and reporting error this identity does not necessarily hold, introducing a trend in the coefficient of variation and improving its performance. To fully explain this phenomenon requires an analytical solution for the statistics of Kt, which requires solving the stochastic process including aggregation and reporting error. However, it can be seen to be plausible if we focus only on stochasticity resulting from reporting error. For low overdispersion (e.g. \u03d5 = 100), the reporting probability distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb = \u03c1Ct. Ignoring demographic stochasticity, we replace Ct with E[Ct] = \u03b7\u03b4(1 \u2212 R0)\u22121. Both the coefficient of variation and skewness for this distribution are \u03bb\u22121/2 = {(1\u2212R0)/\u03c1\u03b7\u03b4}1/2 and the kurtosis is \u03bb\u22121 = (\u03c1\u03b7\u03b4)\u22121(1 \u2212 R0). These two expressions both decrease as R0 increases from 0 to 1, consistent with the experimentally observed AUC < 0.5. The improved performance at low \u03c1 is a consequence of the increased stochasticity in reporting outweighing demographic stochasticity. Can these EWS be used to anticipate disease emergence? If overdispersion and reporting probability are known to be low, then yes. However, it is unlikely that the reporting process is sufficiently understood for an emerging disease. We conclude that these three EWS are unreliable and therefore not good indicators of emergence.",

Therefore increasing reporting overdispersion (i.e increasing \u03d5\u22121) amplifies the response of \u03c32/\u03bc to changes in R0. This leads to a greater differential, improving performance of the index of dispersion as an EWS. However, increased reporting overdispersion also implies increased volatility of data within a finite sized window, which reduces reliability. These two countervailing factors provide an explanation for the optimal performance at intermediate overdispersion values.",

The negative binomial distribution is meant to provide a stringent test on EWS performance, and the parameter ranges are conservative (especially for overdispersion). For instance, if there are 10 actual cases in a week, and reporting error is negative binomially distributed with \u03c1 = 0.1 and \u03d5 = 0.01, then the mean number of reported cases is 1. However, the probability of no cases being reported is P(K = 0) = 0.955 whereas the variance in reported cases is \u03c32 = 101. The resulting time series is highly volatile, with little similarity in appearance to the underlying time series of actual cases. It is unlikely that case reports for an emerging disease will have such high overdispersion. In addition, for a highly pathogenic emerging disease, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or H7N9 avian influenza, the reporting probability is likely much higher than \u03c1 = 1/256 (the smallest value we studied). Nonetheless, one of the encouraging findings of this study is that high reporting is not essential for reliable early warning. Clear trends in the EWS can still be identified, provided there are sufficiently many introductions for cases to be sporadically detected prior to emergence. These dynamics are typical for a reemerging vaccine controllable disease, such as measles, where cases are continually introduced into disease-free regions from endemic regions [45, 46].",

If this is not the case, there is a smaller probability that successive links in a chain of transmission fall into neighboring case reports. We speculate that this reduces the impact of fluctuations in a particular report on the subsequent report, diminishing their correlation. This effect is exacerbated if the reporting probability is low. A more rigorous explanation requires a full solution to the stochastic process with aggregation and reporting error. For many known pathogens the serial interval is larger than one week, for example measles virus and Bordetella pertussis [47]. For other pathogens it is less than one week, such as SARS coronavirus [48] and influenza virus [47, 49]. In order for the autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time to be reliable EWS, our results suggest the data need to be aggregated by periods larger than the serial interval. The performance boost outweighs costs associated with having fewer data points. We expect that these three EWS will work best for pathogens with short serial intervals; for pathogens with extremely long serial intervals (such as HIV) reliable use of these EWS is unlikely.",

As shown in Table 3, both the mean and the variance scale with the introduction rate, which is a product of the per capita introduction rate and the susceptible population size. On the other hand, the index of dispersion, autocorrelation and decay time are all independent of introduction rate. Uncertainty of important factors, such as the susceptible population size, is a key challenge to anticipating emergence, and these three EWS may outperform the mean and the variance if uncertainty is included.

Solid black lines indicate the duration of infectiousness, dots indicate time of recovery. The top panel shows three time series calculated from the simulated data: daily snapshots of the number of infected present in the population (black), weekly case reports (blue) and monthly case reports (red). For the purposes of this paper, the number of recovery events falling within an aggregation period serves as a proxy for the true number of cases in a case report. Aggregation periods are delimited by blue dots for weekly reports and red dashes for monthly reports. No reporting error is applied to the case reports shown in this figure. Transmission dynamics are modeled using the SIR model with birth and death with average population size N0 = 106, importation rate \u03b6 = 1 case per week, mean life expectancy of 70 years, and mean infectious period of 1 week. R0 increases linearly from 0 to 1 over 20 years. Simulations performed using the Gillespie algorithm [33].",

Reporting error is modeled using a negative binomial distribution with \u03c1 = 0.25 and \u03d5 = 0.1. The high overdispersion (small \u03d5) means that there is little visual correspondence between the number of case reports with and without reporting error. Additionally, the number of case reports can exceed the true number of cases (overreporting), in spite of the low reporting rate. SIR simulations performed using the same parameters as Fig 1.",
