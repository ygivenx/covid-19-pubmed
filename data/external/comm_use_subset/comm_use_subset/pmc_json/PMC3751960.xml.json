Kit B corresponds to the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 OneStep ACE Detection and Pneumobacter ACE Detection (Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea); a GeneAmp\u00ae PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems) was used for amplification and the size of PCR products was read on a TapeStation after electrophoresis using ScreenTape. Kit C corresponds to the Magicplex RV Panel Real-time Test (Seegene Inc); the amplification was performed using GeneAmp\u00ae PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems) and the detection of PCR products was done on ABI7500 (Applied Biosystems). Kit D corresponds to Clart\u00ae Pneumovir (Genomica, Madrid, Spain); the amplification was performed on GeneAmp\u00ae PCR system 2700 (Applied Biosystems) and the hybridization of PCR products on the array was read using the Clinical Array System (CAR) (Genomica). Kit E corresponds to xTAG\u00ae respiratory Viral Panel fast (Abbott, Rungis, France) and kit F to ResPlex II Panel v2.0 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), for these two kits, the amplification was performed on GeneAmp\u00ae PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems) and the detection of PCR products on a Luminex platform (Bio-Plex, Bio-Rad).",

The criteria of selection were (i) the presence of clinical ARI, (ii) the detection of a respiratory pathogen by the routine tests described above (except for 14 specimens that were tested initially negative), and (iii) a volume of sample of at least 1.6 ml. The study was conducted on the residual clinical specimens stored at \u221280\u00b0C; for this reason, no informed consent was required from the patients. However, the study was submitted to the approval of the local Ethic Committee of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne.

The molecular diagnosis of these bacteria is most often performed by using home-brew methods and few commercial techniques have been evaluated comparatively [20]\u2013[23]. The simultaneous detection of atypical bacteria and viruses represents a great advantage in terms of clinical management. Indeed, in case of positive result for an atypical bacterium, a rapid treatment with an adapted antimicrobial drug can be proposed [22]; by contrast, if this information is lacking, there is a risk for prescribing no treatment, especially if the specimen is also found positive for one or several viruses, a rather common situation with the present panel. In the opposite case, the absence of atypical bacteria (together with the negativity of conventional bacterial cultures) would allow to spare useless antibiotic treatment and consequently the emergence of bacterial resistance [7].",

Even if molecular techniques are globally considered as the most sensitive, it is difficult to identify a precise method as the reference for a given pathogen or family of pathogens. In addition, the sensitivity may vary when the test is adapted to the whole family (adenoviruses, rhinoviruses/enteroviruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses\u2026) or specific for a single type. Despite this difficulty, the Argene/bioM\u00e9rieux strategy, which consists in the combination of duplex real time PCR methods, was taken as gold standard in the present study; actually, the reduced primer competition due to a combination of biplex amplification together with a higher volume of extracted sample are indicative of a good sensitivity. The low number of strains for some pathogens (i.e. C.pneumophila) and the absence of others (notably parainfluenza virus type 2 and L.pneumophila) constitute an additional limit of the study for accurate comparisons. Another difficulty for comparing these different kits relies on the level of differentiation of the tested pathogens that varied greatly from a manufacturer to another; for instance, some kits were able to detect coronaviruses and parainfluenza viruses at the type or species level whereas others considered the genus level only. For adenoviruses and rhino/enteroviruses, most of the kits used genus-specific targets. Of note, none of the kits was able to detect Parechovirus despite the recent involvement of this genus of Picornaviridae in respiratory infection [42]\u2013[43].",

These \u201cpioneer\u201d technologies were either stopped or improved through new generation kits, as exemplified by kit C that represents a further version of kit B and exhibits the best sensitivity for all the tested viruses. The fact that the panel included a large number of multiple infections could explain some missed results with the multiplex PCR assays tested in this study; indeed, this technology favors primers\u2019 competition, notably for the pathogen(s) exhibiting the lower load in the specimen. This observation may explain the overall low sensitivity observed for coronaviruses, adenoviruses and bocaviruses.

In several companies, this trend was a marked feature for driving the evolution of their kit. The presence of an internal control and, if possible, of a cellular control is also recommended for checking the validity of negative results. Finally, although the results of all these techniques were available in less than 12 hours, the run duration varied significantly from a technique to another. Further studies would be needed for evaluating the consequence of this difference from a clinical point of view.",

On the basis of the present evaluation, the spectrum of detected pathogens (with an advantage for the techniques detecting also atypical bacteria), the technology used for PCR product revelation and the laboratory organization appear as determinant features for the selection of a kit. Further studies are needed for evaluating the cost-benefit of these techniques in the clinical management of respiratory infection.",
