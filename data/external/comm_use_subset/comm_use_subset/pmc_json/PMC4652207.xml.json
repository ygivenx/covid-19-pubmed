Hayward leaves was assessed. When inoculated at the lower dose, the growth of the pathogen within the leaf never exceeded 105cfu/ml and showed a peak of 2-3 \u00d7 104cfu/ml at nine dpi; no symptoms were observed in the inoculated leaves. By contrast, when the pathogen was inoculated at 1-2 \u00d7 107cfu/ml, it incited the appearance of tiny necrotic spots on many of the inoculated leaves of nine dpi (see Supplementary Fig. S1 online). In this case, only the green tissue was precisely removed to prepare the samples.",

A single peak in the obtained melting curve confirmed the specificity of the amplicon, and no signal was detected in the negative controls for all of the tested RGs (see Supplementary Fig. S2 online). In addition, a single band with the expected size was detected in a single PCR product (see Supplementary Fig. S3 online). The standard curve method using a pool of all of the cDNA samples was performed to calculate the PCR efficiency (E) and the correlation coefficient (R2) of each primer pair. Average E values ranged from 100.7 to 108.2%, with R2 varying from 0.991 to 0.999 (Table 1). The results showed that all of the primer pairs were suitable for RT-qPCR analysis.",

The nine candidate RGs displayed a wide expression range, with Cq ranging from 20.23 to 31.31, across all of the tested samples, with mean Cq values between 22.06 \u00b1 0.92 and 28.58 \u00b1 0.86 (Fig. 1). All of the tested RGs showed a normal distribution in Cq values according to the Kolmogorov and Smirnov method. These genes were clearly distributed into different expression level categories. The results showed that CYP was the most expressed gene with the lowest mean Cq (22.06). On the other hand, GLO7A was the least expressed gene with the highest mean Cq value (28.58). TUB showed the most variation in expression level among the evaluated RGs by the larger whisker taps and boxes compared to the other genes, suggesting its low stability. Most of the candidate RGs were highly expressed, with average Cq values between 22 and 24 cycles, except SAND and GLO7A, which showed average Cq values at intermediate expression levels (Fig. 1).",

GAPDH, PP2A and UBC were the three most stable genes in this pathosystem, with slight differences in ranking for three comparison groups. In A. deliciosa leaves inoculated with a low dose of bacterial inoculum, GAPDH was the most stable gene (Table 2), while in leaves inoculated with a high dose of bacterial inoculum and when all of the sample sets were analysed together, PP2A was the most stable gene (Tables 3 and 4). TUB was the least stable gene in three comparison groups (Tables 2, 3 and 4). In this study we used the geNorm algorithm to find the optimal number of suitable RGs required for proper normalization. In three comparison groups, geNorm analysis revealed that by step wise calculation the pairwise variation value V2/3 was lower than the threshold value (0.15), suggesting that two RGs could be used for normalization under these conditions (Fig. 2). This suggested that the optimal number of RGs for normalization was two and that the addition of the third RGs showed no significant effect on the normalization of gene expression. Finally, GAPDH and PP2A were identified as the best RGs and selected for normalization by geNorm.",

            "text": "In research of plant molecular pathology, studies on gene expression patterns are important for understanding the biological process involved in host-plant interactions. Presently, several methods can be applied to study gene expression levels, but RT-qPCR has become the primary quantitative method for the high-throughput and accurate expressing profiling of target genes. For RT-qPCR analysis, the requirement of a normalization method against RGs is important to achieve reliable results. As suggesting by the \u201cMinimum Information for publication of Quantitative real-time PCR Experiments\u201d (MIQE) guidelines4, the use of RGs as internal controls is the most appropriate normalization strategy7. Ideal RGs should be stably expressed in all cells or tissues and remain stable under different experimental conditions42. Several studies highlighted that there is neither a universal RG nor a defined number of genes to use, but the choice and an optimal number of RGs should be experimentally determined427. Many reliable RGs have been determined in plant cells and across different plant species, developmental stages, and biotic and abiotic stresses43. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have been carried out to assess RGs in bacteria-plant pathosystems6. Here, we assessed nine RGs for their use as internal controls in gene expression studies of the A. deliciosa response to infection by PSA upon leaf infiltration using two different doses of bacterial inoculum. To identify the best RGs, four different statistical algorithms were used. Combined use of geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the deltaCt method to select and validate the best RGs generated substantial discrepancies in the final ranking due to different mathematical models associated with each algorithm, as confirmed by other studies184445. As reported in other studies, the most discrepant results in gene stability ranking were obtained with BestKeeper46.",

PP2A was a stable RG in virus-infected leaf tissues of Nicotiana benthiamiana48 and in virus-infected Arabidopsis thaliana43. In our study, UBC was among the four most stable RGs, as demonstrated in Coffea arabica leaves inoculated with Hemileia vastarix49, but was considered to be the least stable RG in common bean inoculated with Colletotrichum lindemuthianum50. TUB was not confirmed as a stable normalization factor in our conditions, confirming our previous proteomic study that showed the variability of this protein in A. chinensis shoot during systemic infection with PSA25; however, in other pathosystems, such as Puccinia graminis f sp. tritici-infected wheat, TUB was one of the most stable RGs51. Furthermore, this RG showed highly variable expression levels in closely related cereals, such as wheat, barley and oat infected with BYDV; TUB was unstable in wheat and reasonably stable in two other species14. The SAND transcript was ranked lower among RGs in our pathosystem than was identified in Nicotiana benthiamiana and Lycopersicum esculentum plants inoculated with viruses5253. These variations in the expression profiles of RGs in different pathosystems confirm the need for validation for RGs under each specific condition.

SOD catalyses the dismutation of O2\u2013 to H2O2, CAT dismutates H2O2 to oxygen and water, and APX reduces H2O2 to water by utilizing ascorbate as a specific electron donor55. The balance between SOD and APX or CAT activities in cells is crucial for determining the steady-state level of O2\u2013 and H2O2. In our study, the accumulation of APX, CAT and SOD gene transcripts was strongly influenced by the dose of bacterial inoculum used. Indeed, these genes involved in ROS detoxification and the oxidative-stress response have a key role for bacteria survival and pathogenesis55. The APX up-regulation during a relatively long time course of infection (i.e., 10 days) was observed upon the twig inoculation with the same high dose of PSA CRA-FRU 8.43 also in the case of A. chinensis \u201cSoreli\u201d25. In the same study, however, neither CAT nor SOD were found differentially expressed 10 days after the twig inoculation. Irrespective of the inoculum doses, both CAT and SOD resulted up-regulated during the first four days of infection, and, subsequently, their level in the leaf tissues declined. Interestingly, a similar trend was observed for SOD in the Phaseolus vulgaris/P. s. pv. phaseolicola pathosystem after the inoculation of bean leaves with the same high dose of bacterial inoculum used in the present study (i.e., 1 \u00d7 10 7 cfu/ml)56. In this study, however, the SOD level in the bean primary leaves and into the apoplastic fluid starts to decrease 48 and 24 hours after the artificial inoculation.",

This bacterial strain was originally isolated from A. chinensis leaf spot and further characterized5758. Plants were maintained in an aseptic room with 95% relative humidity with natural light and no further fertilization after their transfer from the nursery. They were watered regularly. Inoculation took place in spring (i.e., May). The strain was grown for 48 h on nutrient agar (Oxoid) with 3% sucrose added (NSA) at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. Subsequently, a low (1-2 \u00d7 103cfu/ml) and high (1-2 \u00d7 107cfu/ml) dose of bacterial inoculum, determined using spectrophotometry, were prepared in sterile, distilled water. To avoid wounding, the inoculation occurred by gently spraying the suspensions on the abaxial surface of fully expanded, healthy, young leaves, until the appearance of homogenous water-soaked areas on the whole leaf lamina. Twenty plants per dose were inoculated. Artificial inoculations were performed separately, according to the dose. Control plants were treated in the same way with sterile, distilled water. After inoculation, plants were maintained separately and were kept for 24 h in a moist chamber (100% humidity), which was required for optimal infection. During the experiment, the multiplication and growth of the pathogen was assessed as previously described21. Leaves were collected after one day post-inoculation and at intervals of three days for 13 days, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until RNA isolation. In the same treatment group (inoculated and mock inoculated), each biological replicate was obtained by pooling three leaves from different plants harvested at random. Three independent biological replicates were performed for each sample with three technical replicates each.",

These genes belong to different functional and abundance classes to significantly reduce the chance that they are co-regulated. APX, CAT and SOD were selected as genes of interest. Gene-specific primers, such as SAND, TUB, GLO7A, CYP, GAPDH, APX, CAT and SOD, were designed in our laboratory using Primer Expression software version 3 (Table 1). The amplification efficiency of each candidate/target gene was determined using a pool representing all of the cDNA samples. First, all of the primers were examined by end-point PCR, all of the chosen candidates/target were expressed, and specific amplification was confirmed by a single band of appropriate size in a 2% agarose gel after electrophoresis (see Supplementary Fig. S3 online). In a second step, the pool was used to generate a five-point standard curve based on a ten-fold dilution series. The amplification efficiency (E) and correlation coefficient (R2) of the primers were calculated from the slope of the standard curve according to the equation60:",

The stability of candidate RGs for several comparison groups was analysed with the following four applets: geNorm27, NormFinder28, BestKeeper29 and the deltaCt method30. The raw Cq values were converted into relative quantities and imported into the geNorm and NormFinder software programs; no transformed Cq values are required for BestKeeper and the deltaCt method. GeNorm calculates an expression stability value (M) for each RG and then determines the pairwise variation (V) of each RG with all of the other genes. At the end of analysis, by stepwise exclusion of the gene with the highest M-value (less stable), this tool allows for the ranking of the tested RGs according to their expression stability. The optimal number of RGs required for normalization was determined by pairwise variation Vn/Vn + 1 (0.15 recommended threshold).",
