            "text": "The ocular surface of the human eye is directly exposed to many viral, bacterial, and fungal microbes but rarely becomes infected. The human tear film acts in concert with the corneal and conjunctival epithelium to protect the ocular surface. The corneal epithelium forms a barrier that is five-cell layers thick and turns over every 7\u201314 days [1,2]. The tear film is responsible for the clearance of DNA from both human and microbial sources. An assortment of viral nucleotide sequences have been identified in tears of patients infected with viruses including Herpes [3], EBV [4], CMV [5], RSV [6], Varicella Zoster [7,8], HIV [9], Hepatitis B virus [10], Hepatitis C virus [11], SARS [12], and adenovirus [13]. Adenoviral sequences have been detected by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) in tears as long as 13 years after presumed initial infection, and the evidence suggests that the virus persists as a chronic follicular conjunctivitis [13]. Some viruses such as HIV may be easily cultured from the blood but can not be cultured from tears, even in infected patients. Extracellular endonucleases have a potentially important role in tears for the destruction of DNA in apoptosis and the prevention of transfection of viruses to other cells.",

            "text": "Lipocalins, including tear lipocalin (TL), are known to have endonuclease activity in vitro, but whole tears have not been studied. The enzymatic activity of lipocalins is conferred by a conserved LEDFXR domain of the Serratia marcescens Mg2+-dependent nucleases [14]. Catalysis of DNA by TL is probably related to the magnesium water cluster formed by the hydrogen bond created between Glu-127 in a conserved \u03b1-helical segment and water. The nonspecific endonuclease activity of lipocalin is also divalent cation dependent [14]. The specific activity of TL is three orders of magnitude less than DNase I [14]. This paucity of specific activity prompted us to consider the possibility of other endonucleases in tears and determine the contribution of TL to overall enzyme activity. Further, the mode of DNA cleavage by TL is unknown but may be functionally important. DNA hydrolysis may result in either 3\u2032-OH/5\u2032-P or 3\u2032-P/5\u2032-OH ends. Here, we preliminarily characterize the influence of ions on the principal nucleases and establish the mode of DNA hydrolysis.",

For experiments investigating activity with varying ions, the other components of the assay buffer are specifically indicated. After 60 min, reaction products were separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. Ethidium-bromide stained gels were photographed and scanned with a densitometer (IS-100 Digital Imaging System; Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). To compare activities, the relative intensity of the appearance of the relaxed form of the pUC19 plasmid was quantified [14]. One unit of nuclease activity was defined as the amount needed to convert 0.1 \u03bcg sc pUC19 plasmid into its circular form after 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. To study the effects of pH on nuclease activity, the following buffers were used: sodium acetate (pH 4.0- 5,5), Mes-NaOH (pH 5.0\u20136.5), Mops-NaOH (pH 6.4\u20137.6), and Tris-HCl (pH 7.0\u20139.0). The nuclease activity that was observed with chemical inhibitors is presented as a percentage of the activity observed in the absence of inhibitors.

The fractions containing the major peak of activity were analyzed by SDS tricine gel electrophoresis and further purified as previously described for TL [15]. Fractions from a second minor peak of activity partially coincided with protein peaks containing lactoferrin and lysozyme. These fractions were combined and applied to a ConA-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in a solution of 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 to remove the lactoferrin. The flow-through fractions containing nuclease activity were isolated. Lactoferrin was eluted with a gradient of D-glucopyranoside. The fractions containing endonucleases were pooled and applied to a column of DEAE-Sephadex using the parameters as previously published for TL [15].

After agarose gel electrophoresis, the PCR product was eluted and additionally purified using QIA-Quick spin columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). For a single stranded (ss) DNA substrate, the 32-mer oligodeoxynucleotide, TCC AAA TGA GTA CCT GGG GGG ACT TAG GAC CT (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), was eluted from a 25% polyacrylamide gel and labeled at the 5\u2032 end through treatment with [\u03b3-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Both single- and double-stranded DNA templates were subjected to nuclease digestion by TL and the minor tear endonuclease. DNase I was used as a control. The cleavage reactions were performed with 30\u201350 nM DNA and 10 U nuclease containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 1mM CaCl2, and 50 mM NaCl. Aliquots were sampled at different time intervals and analyzed by electrophoresis.

After the correction for dilution, the final concentration of oligonucleotides found in human tear samples was 714\u00b1151 (standard deviation) nanograms/ml. Calculations from the shedding rates of the epithelial cell turnover suggest a contribution from the cornea of about 500 ng/ml DNA in tears [1,2]. The range of values measured for oligonucleotides in tears, 548\u2013842 ng/ml, appears roughly concordant. Both the theoretical and measured values are probably underestimated. DNA from conjunctiva sources was not included in calculations of cellular turnover. Free nucleotides may not be fully recovered from the extraction process, and stimulated tear collection inevitably results in some dilution. Given these limitations, the detection of oligonucleotides provides evidence that hydrolyzed DNA is present in tears.",

A lesser peak (Figure 2B, peak A), corresponding to about 23% of the endonuclease activity, emerged in the shoulder of the absorbance peak corresponding to lactoferrin. Minimal activity, less than 2% of the total, was found in a third peak co-eluting with lactoferrin, fractions 29\u201339 (Figure 2B). Activity was not observed in the zymographic gel electrophoresis in this region and was deemed insignificant. The scarcity of activity of lactoferrin in tears is important since lactoferrin has DNase activity in human milk [20,21].

Disulfide reduction did not affect the position or activity of the minor endonuclease in the zymogram (Figure 3C).

Neither of the two endonucleases in tears is activated solely by Ca2+, excluding a significant contribution from the major human extracellular endonucleases, DNase I and DNase X. Both of these are activated by either Ca2+ or Mg2+ alone. DNase I is found in many body fluids and plays a role in eliminating extracellular DNA in humans [24]. DNase I deficient mice result in the appearance of an autoimmune disease similar to systemic lupus erythematosus [25]. DNase X is a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchored membrane protein located on the cell surface and may prevent endocytosis-mediated transfer of foreign DNA in human muscle [26]. The minor tear endonuclease is active with Mg2+ alone. This is different from two human intracellular DNase \u03b3 and DNAS1L2, which require both Ca2+ and Mg2+. DNase \u03b3 is found in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow [27]. DNase \u03b3 is perinuclear and translocates to the nucleus during apoptosis [28]. Similar to the DNase I family of DNases, TL and the minor endonuclease are synergistically activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Figures 5A,B).",

Both showed some activity at acidic pH. The minor endonuclease appeared to retain slightly more activity than TL outside the physiologic pH range of tears (~7.2\u20137.8) [22]. Beyond this range, the activity falls precipitously, especially at acidic pH. This behavior is similar to other human endonucleases with one exception [23]. DNAS1L2 has been observed to have maximal activity at pH 5.6 [23], excluding it as a candidate for the minor endonuclease. DNAS1L2 is considered an acid endonuclease and may have a role in inflammation, but little is known about this enzyme [29].",

For single strand hydrolysis (Figure 9A), the majority of the digestion products were less than 8 bp and 26 bp with TL and the minor endonuclease, respectively. The size variation of the final single strand hydrolysis products observed in sequencing gels for DNase I, TL, and the minor endonuclease may reflect mechanistic interactions of the DNA substrate with unique binding and cleavage sites. The electrophoretic cleavage patterns in the double strand hydrolysis (Figure 9B) indicate sequence preferences for the three enzymes. Nonspecific nucleases cleave at nearly all positions but will exhibit variations in cleavage rates depending on the DNA sequence. The sequence dependent rate variation results from many local and global factors including the DNA geometry, flexibility, and bending [30]. The hydrolysis pattern with TL (Figure 9B, lanes 1, 2, and 3) features larger gaps compared to DNase I and the minor endonuclease. In addition, an intense signal in one of the smaller fragments was not observed with the other enzymes. The different sequence preferences for all three enzymes undoubtedly reflect different active sites. Although the structure of TL has been solved [31,32], a more thorough understanding of sequence cleavage preferences awaits structural analysis of the enzyme-oligonucleotide complexes.",

Adenovirus infection of the conjunctiva and corneal epithelium may persist for years after infection [13]. Adenoviral DNA sequences may be amplified from tears. Some viruses such as HSV-1 suppress cell apoptotic fragmentation of DNA by evading the action of intracellular caspases and the activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) [1,33,34]. The action promotes the propagation of infection of other cells by promoting replication, transformation, and survival of the virus. A mechanism for extracellular DNA catalysis could counter viral propagation by destroying the viral DNA outside of the intracellular caspase mechanism. Transformation of viral DNA occurs readily in human corneal cells in vitro; adenoviruses transfer with 95% efficiency. As the major endonuclease of tears, TL may have a role in the prevention of viral propagation by transformation. The absence of the major human extracellular nucleases in tears, DNase I and DNase X, serves to heighten the importance of TL in degrading foreign DNA.",
