Rotavirus is also an important pathogen in many agricultural species, inducing serious diarrhoeal diseases in neonatal and postweaning pigs and calves [6\u20138]. Rotavirus infection is limited to the mature enterocytes of the tips of the intestinal villi of humans, domestic animals, and mice, leading to severe gastroenteritis in the young [9]. Some strains of bovine and human RV have high sequence homology and interspecific infectivity, both implying phylogenetic relatedness [10, 11]. Previous in vitro tests of the bovine RF strain of RV on human, pig, chicken, and goat intestine epithelial cells in our laboratory have shown interspecific infectivity of rotavirus [12], and, therefore, the bovine strain of rotavirus was used to infect human and pig intestinal cells in the current study.",

Loss of TER involves alteration of tight junction proteins, mainly claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 as determined in human small intestine carcinoma cells (Caco2) [13], although use of cancer cells for such mechanistic studies is not appropriate. Rotavirus infection is also associated with increased production of lactate, decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and reduced cellular ATP, conditions known to reduce the integrity of epithelial tight junctions [13, 14].

Unfortunately, these compounds are not available for human use, which necessitates alternative methods to control RV infection [21]. A promising alternative strategy to reducing the burden of diarrhoea caused by RV may lie in identifying and developing cost-effective nutritional or phytomedical solutions; which can be applicable especially in children and immunocompromised persons.

It is herein suggested that the observed inactivation of RV may be through interference with either viral replication or capacity to bind to permissive cells. Clark et al. [36] have shown that some phenolic acids, which were expected to dominate the ethanolic extracts, have inactivation effect against RV. Similar observations were also made with extracts from peppermint, sage, and lemon balm leaves, which were highly inhibitive against HIV [37]. The inhibitive effects of T. esculentum extracts, especially seed coat and cotyledon ethanolic extract (MSCE and MCE) and tuber water extract (MTW) (\u2265100%), could additionally be due to enhanced release of nitric oxide (NO) from intestinal cells. Nitric oxide has been shown to inactivate RV, mainly by inhibiting replication of the virus [38, 39]. The observed enhancement of nitric oxide release from the human and pig cells was viewed as one of the mechanisms T. esculentum crude extracts can induce a nonspecific immune response in intestinal epithelium.

            "text": "The observed antirotaviral effects can be attributed to the high phenolic acid content (especially gallic acid), in bean cotyledons, among other components (Marama II report, unpublished). Gallic acid was previously shown to prevent viral replication, inhibition of virus attachment to and penetration into cells, and virucidal effects [41]. Interference with attachment and penetration into cells could not be proved in this study. Tylosema esculentum tubers may contain some yet to be determined phenolics (Marama II report, unpublished). Ethanolic extracts had notably higher antiviral activity than aqueous bean and tuber extracts (Figures 3 and 6). Some essential oils as found in T. esculentum beans may contribute towards the observed antiviral effects; similar findings were reported by Astani et al. [42] using essential oils extracted from Melaleuca alternifolia. Moreover, recently, a Kunitz-type inhibitor, distinct from other known plant serine protease inhibitors and shown to be specific for elastase, was isolated in T. esculentum beans [43]. The quantity of this elastase inhibitor present in T. esculentum beans is many times greater than in soybean or any other bean or nut source reported to date [43]. Certain protease inhibitors have been shown to impart high antienteroviral effects through interference with proteolytic cleavage during the replication process [44]. The high phytosterol content of T. esculentum bean oil 4-desmethylsterols (75%) and 4.4-dimethylsterols and 4-monomethylsterols (15.72%) [4] could also contribute to the high antiviral activity in bean extracts. Phytosterols have been determined to have antihuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and antiherpes simplex virus (HSV) effects [45]. The antiviral activity of phytosterols is through the blocking effect on immediate-early antigen expression in fibroblast cells and blocking of virus-cell interaction and/or virus multiplication [45].

Mechanisms of antiviral action may include release of nitric oxide and may also interfere with viral cytopathic effects (as shown by moderate to high positive correlation between survival from rotavirus and release of nitric oxide), inactivation of RV (inhibition of virus replication or entry into cells may be responsible), possibly through interference with replication, and enhancement of tight junctions (though not directly related to levels of survival) (Figure 1). Our findings suggest that T. esculentum beans can be an important source of microbicides against RV. Further phytochemical characterization of T. esculentum extracts, identification of the responsible bioactive compounds, and the elucidation of other modes of action and quality standard studies are essential.",
