In endemic areas, RVFV naturally circulates among mosquitoes and ruminants, such as sheep, goat and cattle [7]. RVFV infection in adult ruminants causes febrile illness and a high rate of abortions, while some newborn animals less than 1\u20132 weeks of age develop an acute infection which results in higher mortality rates than those in adults [8]. Humans infected with RVFV usually develop an acute febrile myalgic syndrome; however, a small percentage of patients have a lethal illness that results in hepatic damage, hemorrhagic fever-like illness, encephalitis and/or retinal vasculitis [8].",

The S segment encodes N and NSs genes and uses an ambi-sense strategy to express the N and NSs proteins in infected cells; N mRNA encoding N protein is transcribed from the viral-sense (negative-sense) S segment, while NSs mRNA encoding NSs protein is transcribed from the antiviral-sense (positive-sense) S segment. Monocistronic M mRNA and L mRNA are transcribed from the viral-sense M and L segments, respectively. M mRNA has one large open-reading frame (ORF) which encodes the nonstructural NSm protein, a 78-kDa glycoprotein and two major viral structural glycoproteins, Gn and Gc [15],[16]. L mRNA encodes L protein, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Both N and L proteins are required for viral RNA synthesis, while Gn and Gc function as envelope proteins [14]. NSm and NSs, both nonstructural proteins, are dispensable for viral replication in cell cultures [17],[18],[19],[20], but are involved in viral pathogenesis [21],[22],[23].",

            "text": "RVFV NSs protein is not essential for virus replication in cell cultures [19],[20], yet plays a critical role in viral virulence [21]. A naturally occurring RVFV mutant Clone 13, which lacks approximately 70% of the NSs gene [20], is highly attenuated in mouse, and, when reassortant viruses between wt RVFV and Clone 13 were characterized, the NSs was revealed as a major determinant of viral virulence in the mouse model [21]. The NSs localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasm in both RVFV-infected cells and NSs-expressing cells; further, the nuclear NSs, but not the cytoplasmic NSs, forms a unique filamentous structure [24]. The NSs suppresses the transcription of host mRNAs by interacting with the p44 subunit of TFIIH, an essential transcriptional factor for cellular RNA polymerase II [25]. Furthermore, the RVFV NSs binds to Sin3A-Associated Protein 30 (SAP30), which is important for maintaining the repressor complex containing histone deacetylase 3 on the interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 promoter, and suppresses the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation early in infection [26]. Accordingly, the NSs protein in the nucleus of infected cells most probably exerts these host transcriptional-suppressive activities, including that of IFN production inhibition, and contributes to viral virulence [21]. In contrast, the biological function of cytoplasmic NSs is largely unknown. RVFV NSs expression promotes RVFV minigenome RNA synthesis driven by N and L protein in expression studies [27]. Because RNA synthesis of bunyaviruses occurs in the cytoplasm, NSs protein in cytoplasm may promote the minigenome RNA synthesis by unknown mechanism.",

Thus, to secure efficient RVFV replication, the NSs protein, in turn, alters this putative, virally unfriendly cellular environment to one that supports efficient viral replication. To test this possibility, we examined the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene, a mutant which was generated by employing a reverse genetics system [19], in the presence of a host transcription inhibitor, e.g., actinomycin D (ActD) or \u03b1-amanitin; these drugs were selected because they mimicked the host transcriptional suppressive activities of the NSs. Consistent with our supposition, RVFV lacking the NSs, but not RVFV, failed to replicate efficiently in ActD-treated cells. We noted that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2\u03b1 phosphorylation suppressed the translation of RVFV lacking NSs in the presence of ActD. Further studies uncovered that RVFV NSs promoted PKR downregulation as early as 4 hours post-infection, and prevented eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which secured efficient viral translation. We speculate that this novel function of RVFV is important for counteracting the antiviral activities of PKR and allowing efficient virus replication and survival in infected hosts.",

VeroE6 cells were mock-infected or independently infected with MP-12, rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type, the latter of which lacks approximately 70% of the NSs ORF (Figure 1A), at an moi of 3. Cells were radiolabelled with [35S] Methionine/Cysteine from 15 to 16 h.p.i. Cell extracts were prepared at 16 h.p.i., and the samples were applied to SDS-PAGE (Figure 1C, top panel). In the absence of ActD, the host protein synthesis of rMP12-rLuc-infected cells (Figure 1C, lane 5) and rMP12-C13type-infected cells (Figure 1C, lane 7) was more efficient than that of MP-12-infected cells (Figure 1C, lane 3). It is possible that NSs-mediated transcriptional suppression that occurred only in MP-12-infected cells, but not in cells infected with viruses lacking NSs, caused a reduction of host mRNA abundance, leading to the less efficient translation of host mRNAs in MP-12-infected cells. Efficient N protein synthesis occurred in cells infected with all three viruses in the absence of ActD, a finding which was consistent with our previous studies [19], while for some unknown reasons the accumulation of N proteins of rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type was slightly higher than that of MP-12. ActD treatment resulted in a strong inhibition of both host proteins and N protein synthesis in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells (Figure 1C, lane 6) and rMP12-C13type-infected cells (Figure 1C, lane 8). In contrast, ActD treatment did not inhibit N protein translation in MP-12-infected cells; rather, it moderately inhibited host protein synthesis in MP-12-infected cells (Figure 1C, lane 4). A similar ActD-induced, moderate host protein synthesis inhibition also occurred in mock-infected cells (Figure 1C, lane 2). Western blot analysis of cell extracts at 16 h.p.i. clearly showed that ActD treatment strongly inhibited N protein accumulation in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells and rMP12-C13type-infected cells, but not in MP-12-infected cells (Figure 1C, bottom panels). In summary, ActD treatment had little effect on MP-12 replication, whereas it strongly inhibited the expression of both host and viral proteins in the cells infected with MP-12 lacking the NSs gene, which resulted in poor virus production.",

After virus adsorption, infected cells were mock-transfected or independently transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), MP-12 NSs, or wt RVFV ZH501 NSs. Then, the cells were mock-treated or treated with ActD. Analysis of rLuc activities at 16 h.p.i. demonstrated that NSs expression had little effect on rLuc activities in the absence of ActD (Figure 2A). In the presence of ActD, rLuc activities were clearly higher in the cells transfected with MP-12 NSs RNA transcripts or ZH501 NSs RNA transcripts than in those transfected with CAT RNA transcripts or in the mock-transfected samples (Figure 2A). In NSs RNA-transfected cells, similar levels of rMP-12-rLuc titers were observed in both the ActD-treated and mock-treated samples, whereas the rMP12-rLuc virus titers in mock-transfected cells and CAT RNA-transfected cells were significantly lower in the presence of ActD compared to the ActD-untreated cells (Figure 2B). Western blot analysis showed that NSs proteins were indeed expressed in the cells transfected with RNA transcripts encoding MP-12 NSs or wt RVFV ZH501 NSs (Figure 2C, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Also NSs protein expression increased the accumulation of rMP12-rLuc N protein in the presence of ActD (Figure 2C, lanes 7 and 8). These data demonstrated that NSs exerted efficient rMP12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD. We noted that ActD treatment modestly reduced the accumulation of the CAT protein (Figure 2C, lane 6). Probably large amounts of CAT RNA transcripts that were introduced into the cells partly overcame the translational suppressive effects that were induced by the combination of rMP-12-rLuc replication and ActD treatment.",

Because ActD treatment at 5 \u00b5g/ml inhibits the transcription mediated by RNA polymerases I, II and III [28], we expected a reduction in the abundance of cellular mRNAs, tRNAs, and ribosomal RNAs, leading to reduced abundances of polysomes. ActD treatment indeed resulted in a reduced abundance of polysomes, whereas it did not substantially alter the polysome pattern, a finding which suggested to us that ActD treatment did not abolish translational activities. To test the translational competence of the cells treated with transcriptional inhibitors, we transfected 293 cells with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding rLuc gene. Cells were mock-treated or treated with ActD or \u03b1-amanitin, an RNA polymerase II inhibitor [29]. The rLuc activities at 16 h post-transfection were slightly increased in the cells treated with ActD or \u03b1-amanitin (Figure S1B), demonstrating active host translation activities in the presence of either ActD or \u03b1-amanitin. These data led to the suggestion that by combining the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs and treatment of ActD, a cellular condition that is unfavorable for translation could be induced and that NSs expression somehow altered the cellular environment from one that was translationally inactive to one translationally active.",

We also noted that MP-12 co-infection did not reduce the abundance of the viral-sense rMP-12-rLuc S segment in the presence of ActD, and yet it caused the reduction of rLuc mRNA abundance (Figure 3B, lane 9), which we believe implies that NSs expression and ActD treatment generated a cellular environment that was more favorable for rMP-12-rLuc RNA replication than for transcription.",

The eIF2\u03b1 is a component of eIF2, which binds to GTP and Met-tRNA to deliver the Met-tRNA to the start codon in capped mRNA, forming a 43S pre-initiation complex [32]. Upon the binding of the 60S ribosomal subunits to the 43S preinitiation complex, eIF2-GDP is released from the ribosome and undergoes a GTP exchange reaction catalyzed by binding with eIF2B, and the resultant eIF2-GTP is recycled for the next round of translation initiation. The phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 binds to eIF2B with a high affinity and prevents eIF2B to be used for the subsequent eIF2-GDP-to-eIF2-GTP exchange reaction, leading to the suppression of translation initiation. Hence, the phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 plays a critical role in translational control [32].",

When we analyzed the level of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in VeroE6 cells infected with rMP12-rLuc in the absence of transcription inhibitor, we found low levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation from 8 to 24 h.p.i. and an efficient accumulation of N protein at 8 h.p.i. and onward (Figure 4A\u20134C). In contrast, when we treated rMP12-rLuc-infected cells with ActD or \u03b1-amanitin, either compound induced an efficient accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 from 8 to 16 h.p.i., with a concomitant poor N protein accumulation (Figure 4A\u20134C) and virus replication suppression (Figure 4D). The mechanism of reduction in the abundance of the phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 at 24 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD or \u03b1-amanitin (Figure 4, lanes 13 and 19) is unknown. When we treated rMP12-rLuc-infected cells with different concentrations of ActD or \u03b1-amanitin, we found that the inhibition of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 accumulation was dependent on the concentrations used (Figure S2). Also a strong correlation was seen between an increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and the decrease in both N protein accumulation and infectious virus production (Figure S2). In contrast, no significant accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 occurred in MP-12-infected VeroE6 cells in the presence of ActD (Figure 4A\u20134C). As expected, ActD treatment had little effect on MP-12 replication (Figure 4D). These data strongly suggested that the presence of highly phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 levels suppressed the translation of viral mRNAs, leading to inefficient virus production, and that the NSs protein somehow suppressed eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, and facilitated efficient viral mRNA translation under the conditions of host transcriptional shutoff.",

VeroE6 cells, either infected with rMP12-rLuc or mock-infected, received the pan-caspase-inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-DL-Asp(OMe) fluoromethylketone (Z-VADfmk), in the presence of ActD or \u03b1-amanitin (Figure S3). Judging from the resulting inhibition of cleaved caspase-3 accumulation in these cells, the Z-VADfmk treatment indeed inhibited apoptosis, whereas it had little effect on the eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation status and infectious virus yield. These data suggested to us that the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 in cells supporting rMP12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD or \u03b1-amanitin was caspase-independent.",

To determine the role of PKR in the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells treated with ActD or \u03b1-amanitin, we generated a recombinant MP-12, rMP12-PKR\u0394E7, which expresses a dominant-negative form of PKR, PKR\u0394E7 [36] carrying the N-terminal Flag epitope tag, in place of the NSs (Figure 5A). If the replication of MP-12 lacking the NSs gene in cells subjected to host transcriptional suppression activates PKR, which in turn phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, then the virally-encoded PKR\u0394E7 in rMP12-PKR\u0394E7-infected cells would interfere with the PKR function, resulting in the inhibition of PKR-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and thereby leading to efficient viral translation and virus production. VeroE6 cells were mock-infected or independently infected with rMP12-rLuc, rMP12-PKR\u0394E7 and MP-12 at an moi of 3. After the removal of the inocula, cells were treated with ActD or \u03b1-amanitin, and cell extracts were harvested at 16 h.p.i. As expected, rMP12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD or \u03b1-amanitin induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulted in reduced virus replication (Figure 5B\u20135D). In contrast, efficient N protein accumulation and efficient virus replication, with no significant accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 occurred in both MP-12-infected cells and rMP12-PKR\u0394E7-infected cells in the presence of ActD- or \u03b1-amanitin (Figure 5B\u20135D).

Indeed, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA accumulation occurred at 8 h.p.i. in rMP-12-rLuc-infected cells in the absence of ActD, but not in the presence of ActD (Figure 6C), a finding which suggested that ActD treatment inhibited the transcriptional induction of PKR which was induced by the type I IFN in infected 293 cells. We noted an efficient accumulation of rMP12-rLuc N mRNA at 8 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD (Figure 6C). Because rMP-12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD did not induce an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 early in the course of the infection (Figure 4A), this efficient rMP12-rLuc replication probably occurred prior to 8 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD. As shown in Figure 6D, immunoprecipitated PKR from rMP12-rLuc-Flag-infected cells was phosphorylated both in the presence and absence of ActD, which led us to suggest that rMP12-rLuc-Flag replication activated PKR. In contrast, PKR phosphorylation did not occur in mock-infected cells or cells infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag or rMP12-PKR\u0394E7 (Figure 6D). Most probably, a dominant-negative PKR\u0394E7 suppressed PKR activation and prevented PKR phosphorylation [36]. To determine why we failed to detect the presence of PKR autophosporylation in rMP12-NSs-Flag-infected cells, we examined the amounts of the immunoprecipitated PKR in these samples (Figure 6D, bottom). Strikingly, substantial reductions in the abundance of cytoplasmic PKR occurred only in the cells supporting rMP12-NSs-Flag replication both in the presence and absence of ActD.",

In the absence of proteasome inhibitor, a substantial reduction of PKR abundance occurred as early as 4 h.p.i., where the abundance of NSs (Figure 7G, lane 2) was not as great as that at 8 h.p.i. (Figure 7G, lane 4). In the presence of MG132, the abundance of PKR decreased only slightly, and NSs accumulation was also somewhat less efficient. A similar trend for less efficient NSs accumulation in the presence of proteasome inhibitors was also shown in the data for Figure 7F. Our observation of less efficient NSs accumulation in MG132-treated cells was consistent with the report that MG132 induces eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation through GCN2 activation and translational suppression [42]. The abundance of NSs in MG132-treated cells at 8 h.p.i. and that in untreated cells at 4 h.p.i. was similar, and yet PKR abundance in the former cells was clearly higher than that in the latter cells. Taken together, these data strongly suggested that RVFV NSs promoted PKR degradation through the proteasome-dependent pathway.",

The NSs protein was essential for efficient virus replication in the presence of ActD or \u03b1-amanitin. We found that the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of a transcription inhibitor induced an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, The accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors, did not occur in VeroE6 cells that were infected with RVFV expressing a dominant-negative form of PKR (PKR\u0394E7) and in MEF cells lacking functional PKR (Figure 5). These findings suggested to us that PKR played a major role in increasing phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1; however, it is currently unclear whether other kinases, such as PERK or GCN2, have a possible role in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in rMP-12-rLuc-infected cells in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors. The endogenous PKR-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation suppressed translation of the RVFV lacking the NSs gene, resulting in poor virus replication. Our data further suggested that the NSs promoted PKR degradation most probably through a proteasome-dependent pathway and prevented eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, leading to efficient viral translation.",

Namely, nuclear NSs protein inhibits transcription of host mRNAs, including the IFN mRNAs; this activity is critical for efficient RVFV replication in IFN-competent systems [25],[45]. However, a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-mediated host mRNA transcriptional suppression possibly induces PKR activation and subsequent eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation as a combination of RVFV replication and ActD or \u03b1-amanitin treatment induced it. The NSs protein, in turn, promotes PKR downregulation as early as 4 h.p.i., and prevents eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to secure the translation of viral mRNAs and efficient virus replication. We think that both of these two NSs functions are tightly related and protect efficient viral replication by suppressing host antiviral responses. In RVFV-infected cells, the NSs establishes general transcriptional suppression at a later stage of infection (after 8 h.p.i.) [25], while NSs also suppresses specific IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription at early stages of infection (about 3 h.p.i.) by maintaining repressor complex including SAP30 on IFN-\u03b2 promoter [26],[45]. PKR downregulation early in infection is probably important for maintaining efficient viral translation in combination with the suppression of host IFN responses.",

RVFV-infection in rhesus monkeys showed that type I IFN is detectable around 1 day post-infection in both clinically ill surviving monkeys and lethally infected monkeys, and one dead monkey even kept high titer of IFN (120 to 480 U/ml) from 1 day post-infection [46]. In fact, the best correlation with outcome was early detection of IFN and not necessarily the height of the response. NSs suppresses IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription early in the course of infection in cultured cells [26],[45]. Our present data suggest that the early downregulation of PKR in RVFV-infected cells might contribute to the inhibition of type I IFN induction, because PKR is known to serve as a pathogen-recognition receptor [47]. Furthermore, some of the host pathogen-recognition receptors, e.g., toll-like receptors 3 and 7, in uninfected cells located near the RVFV-infected cells, recognize virus-specific signals, e.g., viral RNAs in the virus particles or viral dsRNAs in the cell debris from infected cells, leading to type I IFN production. Because the transcriptional promoter of the PKR gene contains an IFN-stimulated response element, and IFN stimulation induces PKR mRNA transcription [38], PKR abundance is likely increased in many uninfected cells of infected animals; RVFV needs to replicate in such cells to survive in infected hosts. The reduction in PKR abundance occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. (Figure 7G) and the NSs protein is produced very early in RVFV infection [48]. Immediate NSs synthesis and subsequent NSs-induced PKR downregulation in the cells, some of which have increased PKR abundance, could rapidly disarm the PKR-mediated, antiviral functions and contribute to RVFV replication and survival in animal hosts.",

One possible mechanism relates to the eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation step. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at Serine 51 induces a rapid synthesis of activating transcription factor (ATF)-4 mRNA, which can be translated in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 [49]. Expressed ATF4 then induces GADD34 mRNA transcription [50] and GADD34 protein interacts with type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase, PP1, and this complex dephosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 to resume the cellular translation [51]. rMP12-rLuc replication in transcriptionally active cells probably induced PKR activation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, the latter of which then induced GADD34 upregulation and subsequent eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation allowing efficient viral translation. rMP12-rLuc replication in cells treated with ActD induced PKR activation, the extent of which was similar to that of infected, ActD-untreated cells (Figure 6D), whereas the transcription inhibitors would prevent GADD34 upregulation and subsequent eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, causing an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, which inhibited viral translation. Other possible mechanisms relate to the failure to suppress the PKR function. Cells infected with adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus-1, or herpes simplex virus undergo a dramatic increase in the abundance of Alu RNA, which carries a repetitive element of \u223c300-nt in length that is transcribed by RNA polymerase III [52],[53],[54],[55]. Alu RNA forms a stable complex with PKR, and antagonizes the PKR activation [56]. If rMP12-rLuc replication induces Alu RNA accumulation to prevent PKR activation, then the drug-induced transcriptional suppression would inhibit Alu RNA accumulation, preventing Alu RNA-mediated PKR inactivation. Another possibility is that rMP12-rLuc replication transcriptionally induces host mRNAs, and some of their gene products have PKR inhibition activities. An example of this possibility is that influenza virus replication induces P58IPK, an inhibitor of PKR [57]. ActD or \u03b1-amanitin treatment suppresses the expression of the putative PKR inhibitor, resulting in an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1. Alternatively, transcriptional suppression may result in reduced amounts of ribosomal proteins, such as L18, which binds to PKR and inhibits PKR activation [58],[59]. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and the combination of these possibilities may contribute to the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 in the cells supporting replication of RVFV lacking the NSs in the presence of ActD or \u03b1-amanitin.",

In contrast to poliovirus, only RVFV NSs protein was probably required for PKR downregulation since the downregulation of PKR occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. in RVFV-infected cells (Figure 7G), whereas phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 accumulation occurred around 8 h.p.i. in rMP-12-rLuc-infected cells in the presence of ActD (Figure 4). Furthermore, NSs downregulated PKRK296R, a non-phosphorylatable mutant PKR (Figure 7E). These data suggest that the phosphorylation of PKR was not essential for the NSs-mediated PKR downregulation.",

Expression of NSs alone resulted in a reduction in the amount of PKR (Figure 7B). These data established that NSs protein induced PKR downregulation. The NSs-induced PKR downregulation occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. of MP-12 (Figure 7G). We also demonstrated the presence of PKR mRNA in NSs-expressing cells (Figure 7C) and that ActD treatment had little effect on the NSs-induced PKR downregulation (Figure 7B). We failed to detect PKR at 16 h.p.i. of MP-12-infected 293 cells, and yet we easily detected the PKR after a 16 h-long incubation of 293 cells with puromycin (Figure 7D). Accordingly, the putative NSs-induced translational inhibition was not a main reason for the reduction in the abundance of PKR. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments showed that NSs expression reduced the abundance of radiolabelled myc-tagged PKR (Figure 7E). All of these data strongly suggested that the NSs induced PKR downregulation at post-transcriptional levels.",

Because NSs induced PKR degradation in ActD-treated cells and ActD treatment completely inhibited the IFN-\u03b3 mRNA accumulation (Figure 6C), it is highly unlikely that IFN-\u03b3 was involved in the NSs-induced PKR downregulation. PKC activation also potentially induces PKR downregulation [41]. Treatment of MP-12-infected cells with a PKC inhibitor, G\u00d66983, did not inhibit NSs-mediated PKR downregulation (Figure 7D), which implied that PKC was not involved in it. Experiments using a proteasome inhibitor suggested that the NSs promoted PKR degradation through a proteasome pathway (Figure 7F). MG132 can induce GCN activation and translational suppression [42]. In fact, treatment of MP-12-infected cells with MG132 and lactacystin moderately reduced the accumulation of NSs (Figure 7F and 7G). Accordingly, a possibility still exists that the MG132-induced moderate translational inhibition affected the NSs-induced PKR degradation in MG132-treated cells. For example, if the NSs-induced PKR downregulation requires an unstable host protein, then the MG132-induced moderate translational suppression would prevent accumulation of this putative host protein, resulting in inhibition of the NSs-induced PKR downregulation. Obviously further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of PKR downregulation mediated by RVFV NSs.",
