Their ubiquitous nature results in the development of Ad-specific neutralizing antibodies, popularly known as \u2018preexisting vector immunity\u2019 in the majority of the individuals [13]\u2013[15]. Ad-neutralizing antibodies inhibit the vector extracellularly, while Ad-specific CD8+ T cells destroy vector expressing cells [16], [17] thereby adversely impacting the duration and levels of transgene expression. Experimental studies in animal models have shown that in the presence of extremely high levels of Ad-neutralizing antibodies, there is a significant inhibition in the development of immunogen-specific immune responses [18]. A comprehensive analysis of Ad seroprevalence found that HAd5 neutralizing antibody titers in the study's participants varied by geographic location and ranged from 18 to 4690 [19]. According to this study, 26% of the participants had titers below 200, 40% had titers below 1000, and 20% exhibited titers greater than 1000. These studies have underscored the need to further evaluate the role of vector immunity in inhibiting the immunogenicity and efficacy of HAd vector-based vaccines.",

After the development of HAd5-specific immunity, HAd-primed mice were immunized i.n. or i.m. with a low or high dose of a HAd vector (HAd-HA-NP) carrying the hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of the A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus. We also assessed if we could overcome vector immunity by increasing the vaccine dose and changing the route of immunization. Our results suggest that a high level (up to a neutralization titer of 2240) of vector immunity can be tolerated or effectively overcome by increasing the vaccine dose or using alternate routes of vaccination.",

Two distinct polypeptide bands of approximate molecular weights 77 kDa and 50 kDa, representing the HA precursor (HA0) and a proteolytic cleavage product (HA1), respectively, (Figure 1B) were observed in the HAd-HA-NP infected 293 cell lysate.

Ad vector-based influenza vaccines have been shown in clinical studies to be safe and immunogenic in humans [24], [25]. The strong innate and adaptive immune responses induced by Ad vectors impart adjuvant-like properties facilitating better immune responses against the transgene product/s. However, several preclinical studies have suggested that the presence of preexisting HAd-specific neutralizing antibodies might inhibit the generation of immune responses against the expressed immunogen [1], [14], [18]. In the present study, we evaluated the role of preexisting HAd5-specific neutralizing antibodies in inhibiting the immunogenicity and efficacy of a HAd5 vector-based H5N1 influenza vaccine in a mouse model. Low levels of vector immunity (<520 virus-neutralization titer) did not seem to adversely affect the protective vaccine efficacy, while further increases in vector immunity were taken care of by using an alternate route of immunization or by an increase in the vaccine dose. The importance of NP-specific CD4 T cells and non-neutralizing antibodies in the virus clearance was not pursued in this study.",

This level of vector immunity could be overcome either by changing the route of priming and immunization or by increasing the vaccine dose by five-fold. To test the upper limit of vector immunity that could be tolerated without adversely affecting the vaccine protective efficacy, the vector-specific neutralizing antibody titer was raised to 2240 by i.n. priming with high doses of HAd5. The inhibitory effect was partially overcome by the five-fold increase in the vaccine dose, and the resultant immune response was sufficient to provide complete protection.

It has been suggested that the route of vaccination impacts the magnitude, phenotype and trafficking of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in mice [29], [30]. A HAd-based HIV vaccine also showed some inhibition in eliciting immunogen-specific immune responses in the presence of vector immunity, however, this effect was minimized by increasing the vaccine dose [31]. Nevertheless, in a clinical trial with a HAd-based influenza vaccine, there were no strong correlations between vector immunity levels and a decrease in vaccine efficacy [25]. The inhibitory effect of vector immunity was more pronounced for the humoral immune response compared to the CMI response which is consistent with previous reports [32]\u2013[34]. Taken together, our data clearly show that the magnitude of humoral and cellular immune responses to Ad-vectored vaccine antigens depend upon the levels of preexisting antibodies against the vector. However, vector-specific immune responses can be overcome by increasing the antigen dose or by administering antigen by a different route. In conclusion, based on the present study alone, it will be difficult to predict the range of the vector immunity in humans that can be tolerated or overcome by either increasing the dose or changing the route of administration of the HAd5 vector-based vaccines. Nevertheless, the study does highlight the importance of exploring these strategies in humans to improve the outcome of HAd5 vector-based vaccines.",

The polybasic cleavage site QRERRRKKR\u2193G present in the HA gene of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus was modified to QRETR\u2193G to reduce the rare possibility of genetic exchange between the HA in HAd-HA-NP vaccine and a circulating strains of influenza A virus. The full-length coding region of NP gene of the A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus under control of the murine CMV promoter and the SV40 polyA was similarly inserted into the E1 region of the HAd genome. Both genes in HAd-HA-NP were in the E1-parallel orientation. The recombinant virus was plaque purified, and its genome was analyzed by restriction enzyme digestions to confirm the presence of HA and NP gene cassettes and the absence of any other major deletion or insertion.",

Since this reassortant virus is not lethal and does not produce clinical disease and weight loss in mice, protection efficacy was monitored by viral clearance in the lungs. Three days post-challenge, mice were euthanized, and the lungs were collected to determine viral titers to evaluate protective efficacy. Briefly, thawed lung tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of sterile PBS. These lung homogenates were then titrated in 10-day-old embryonated eggs in a 10-fold dilution, and positive eggs were identified by hemagglutination of horse red blood cells with allantoic fluid. Values were expressed as log10 EID50/ml \u00b1 SEM. The limit of virus detection was set as 1.5 log10 EID50/ml [39]. The NP genes are fairly conserved between A/Vietnam/1203-04 (in the Ad vector) and A/PR8/34 (the backbone of the challenge virus); there is 93% identity at the amino acid level and 85% identity at the nucleotide level.
