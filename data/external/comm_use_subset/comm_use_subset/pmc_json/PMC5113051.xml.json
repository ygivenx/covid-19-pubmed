This family had lived in Venezuela for more than two months before 20 February 2016; then they flew to New York on that day and stayed there for ~4 days. Finally, they flew from New York to Guangzhou, China on 24 February 2016 (Figure 1). These four infected individuals were first confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Baiyun International Airport of Guangzhou, where the youngest one (the son) had developed fever, and the family was then isolated by the local department of public health. The infected individuals then lived in a shared ward (without other patients) in the infectious disease department of Enping People's hospital. The room had been screened against mosquitoes, and each bed was also covered with a bed net to prevent spreading by local competent vectors. At the time of hospitalization, the subjects' clinical history and results of a general physical examination, blood tests and routine urine tests were documented. The youngest one (a 6-year-old boy) was the first case whose manifestation was fever and maculopapules. Saliva, urine and peripheral blood were collected from the patients during the onset and recovery period and were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. All samples were tested for ZIKV RNA by real-time PCR, and some urine was utilized to isolate virus. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before sample collection. The study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center.",

Before returning to China, they had no symptoms of any infectious disease, but the son and the daughter both had a history of mosquito bites in Venezuela according to the father's memory, although the specific date of biting was not clear. The 8-year-old daughter was the second one who had symptoms, which included fever and rash, with the rash occurring on the second day after her brother had fever and rash. The 40-year-old father was the latest patient; the only symptom he had was a rash, and the rash was distributed uniformly on his neck and back (Figure 2). His neck rash first occurred on the third day after his son showed fever and rash. The 37-year-old mother did not have any symptoms during the whole period of observation. A time axis based on rash indicates the sequence, the time interval and the date of positive detection for ZIKV (Figure 3). The four family members had been isolated since 25 February 2016, and they were released on 9 March 2016. The clinical laboratory showed results that the overall symptoms of the four subjects were mild.

The E gene sequence of patient 1 is identical to Z16019 (GenBank: KU955590.1, submitted by Wu et al, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention), the viral sequence from the same patient. We found that all our sequences were similar to those of strains circulating in South America, especially Brazil (Figure 4). To further investigate the origin of the ZIKV isolated from our subjects, phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maxim likelihood method. The whole tree can be divided into African and Asian lineages, and all strains isolated from China belong to the Asian lineage. The strain HQ234499.1-P6-740, isolated from A. aegypti in Malaysia in 1966, is the earliest ancestor of the Asian lineage. The strains KU820899.2-ZJ03, KU866423.1-virus/SZ01/2016 and KU955589.1-Z16006 are isolated among imported cases from Samoa or Fiji, pacific islands near Asia. From the aspect of molecular evolution, they are at the ancestor level of French Polynesian strain KJ776791.1-H/PF/2013, which caused an outbreak of ZIKV infection in 2013. KU744693.1-VE Ganxian (imported from Venezuela) is another cluster located a long distance from the cluster of current imported Venezuelan strains in our study. Our strains from the family we are studying, as well as other strains isolated from imported cases in China during the same period of time, form a cluster near the Brazilian strains isolated in 2015. As there is a high bootstrap value at the node of this branch, together with enough evolutionary distance, HQ234499.1-P6-740 (isolated from A. aegypti) is an ideal outgroup strain in the Asian lineage.",

Rash was reported to be the most frequent symptom (presented in 95.7% cases), followed by fever and arthralgia.20 In general, symptoms of ZIKV infection (mild flu-like symptoms) are milder than those of Dengue virus (DENV) infection; the latter often include high-grade fever with myalgia, headache, arthralgia and nausea. Leukopenia (<4000/mm3) has been detected in ~30% of Dengue fever patients.21 In our study, one adult and two children had the symptoms of fever, rash and conjunctival congestion, and no one complained of any pain. Unexpectedly, the three patients with fever all had normal leukocyte counts (>4000/mm3). Whether the milder symptoms of ZIKV infection (milder than DENV infection) mean a higher leukocyte count is unclear because of the lack of data obtained in past reports on ZIKV outbreaks. Hence, if the mother without any symptoms in our study is considered only a carrier of ZIKV (not a patient), this proportion of patients in our study is almost consistent with previous reports, in which rashes were presented by almost all patients.20 Information about pruritus, the second most common clinical symptom in the confirmed cases in previous study,22 was not obtained from the family while inquiring them regarding their case history.

Because complete genome sequencing of an RNA virus is a time-consuming procedure, constructing a phylogenetic tree using E protein gene sequences is a simpler method for molecular epidemiologic study, especially in an outbreak. In our phylogenetic tree constructed from E protein gene sequences, ZIKV can be divided into two lineages, African and Asian.32, 33 Although there is a very short evolutionary distance between our strains and the Venezuela imported strain KU744693.1-VE Ganxian, the diversity of the strains is apparent, and the latter is nearer to KJ776791.1-H/PF/2013 French Polynesian strains.31, 34 Currently, all cases reported in China seem to be imported from South America and Pacific islands, which also indicates there was a great diversity of strains circulating during early 2016 in Venezuela. Our strains are more similar to the strains circulating in South America in late 2015, where there were more strains isolated from patients. A phylogenetic tree based on NS1 gene sequences cannot efficiently distinguish different subgroups of ZIKV from various sources of isolates (Supplementary Figure S1) because the NS1 gene sequence is more conserved than that of E or even NS5, which is a gene sequence used more frequently to build phylogenetic trees. Currently, the E gene sequence is the most commonly used sequence in molecular epidemiologic studies of flaviviruses because it has the greatest genetic diversity (Supplementary Figure S1).",

The fact that ZIKV can propagate in the C6/36 cell line derived from A. albopictus suggests that this mosquito may be a competent vector and have the potential for spreading the virus,5 although there have not been any reported isolates from mosquitoes in South China. A previous experiment conducted in laboratory indicated that ZIKV could be detected in the midgut and salivary glands of A. albopictus ten days after oral infection.36 Outbreaks of DENV have proved that South China may be a permissible environment for transmission of emerging viral diseases such as ZIKV, and imported cases may be sources of subsequent autochthonous cases.37, 38",

Similar to the mother in our study, asymptomatic individuals with viremia may be a source of infection when they are exposed to competent vectors. If the son's fever had not been found at the airport entrance, our subjects would not have been suspected of being infected with ZIKV, and thus their viremia would not have been confirmed. It is difficult to convince ZIKV carriers to be examined even if they are returning from an affected region. Furthermore, in addition to the mosquito-borne route, other complex modes of transmission such as body fluid transmission will make controlling ZIKV infection even more difficult than controlling Dengue fever. The priorities for control include strengthening the education of travelers from infected areas to non-epidemic regions, identifying virus carriers, preventing local transmission caused by imported cases, and an effective vector management program.",

However, because they are a family, the probability of human-to-human transmission by close contact between family members should not be ignored. If their ZIKV infections were all caused by mosquito-biting, from a time axis showing when symptoms occurred, the incubation periods of three of the patients were all more than five days (Figure 3), which is consistent with previous reports (2\u20137-day incubation period according to the World Health Organization website). DENV transmission by non-blood routes is almost impossible, so vector transmission is nearly the only way. Thus, as for clustered cases in one family, if the vector transmission is considered, ZIKV can be comparable to DENV because they have the same transmission dynamics via vectors. Until now, there have been no reports of DENV case numbers in one family being more than two, especially when they share the same virus sequence. Therefore, because vector transmission of DENV between family members is less likely, so is that of ZIKV. Because the ZIKV isolated from three members is identical and there was a 1 to 3 day interval between initial symptom occurrence, human-to-human transmission may also be a plausible explanation. Moreover, viral isolation from urine and saliva samples (collected on 29 February 2016) of three patients was performed successfully using inoculation of suckling mice (data not shown), indicating that during onset, there was viral shedding in these three patients' body fluids, which was infectious to their family members.",

RT-PCR positivity for ZIKV RNA together with successful viral isolation from the three patients' urine samples proved that there were live viruses present in these samples. RT-PCR also indicated the existence of viral RNA in the patients' saliva. However, currently there is no reliable evidence demonstrating ZIKV transmission via these types of bodily fluids.",
