The sequences confirmed that the virus encodes at least four proteins (Figure 1): the 126 kDa replicase component; the 183 kDa replicase component that arises from translational read-though of the amber termination codon of the 126 kDa protein gene; a 30 kDa movement protein (MP) required for TMV RNA translocation between cells; and a 17.5 kDa capsid protein (CP) that enables long distance spread between leaves and stable transmission between plants [9]. A fifth, 54 kDa protein, predicted as the difference between the two replicase components, has an undefined virological role if any [9], and a sixth, 4.8 kDa protein, ORF6, encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) overlapping the MP and CP genes, influences symptomology [10].",

            "text": "The sequence of TMV variant V01408.1, herein dubbed the Goelet sequence, became a reference by which all other plant viruses were compared, and it facilitated the creation of TMV cDNA from which infectious RNA transcripts could be expressed [11], opening new possibilities for characterizing the encoded genes and for transiently expressing foreign genes in plants [12]. Amidst all this success, however, is the almost forgotten fact that the Goelet sequence does not represent a single molecule of a TMV genome. Rather, it is a composite consensus of more than 400 independent clones of cDNA fragments reverse transcribed from a population of TMV RNA molecules exhibiting nucleotide polymorphisms consistent with the inherent error rate of viral RNA-dependent replication. Complicating matters is the likelihood that the virus that Goelet et al. sequenced was a mixture of closely related strains [13]. Today, the Goelet sequence is the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) reference sequence for TMV (NC_001367.1). In 2009, its accession was updated to include the ORF6 protein, but to this date the genomic nucleotide sequence has not been amended. Furthermore, sequences for more than a hundred TMV variants or strains have been reported and none has been merged with NC_001367.1. Consequently, BLAST alignment of NC_001367.1 to all other full-length TMV genomic sequences in the partially non-redundant NCBI Nucleotide collection yields only one hit with perfect identity: itself. Meanwhile, other TMV variants have been molecularly cloned and demonstrated to be infectious [11,14], but there is no known infectious clone for the Goelet sequence, and it remains unknown whether the Goelet sequence represents an infectious viral molecule.",

This advance is part of the domain called synthetic biology, a discipline that can be used to verify the veracity of genome sequences, perform archeology, and assemble genomes de novo[15,16]. Poliovirus was the first virus to have its genome chemically synthesized based on an alphabetic text blueprint of its nucleotide sequence, a feat later performed for other animal and bacterial viruses [16-25]. The complete chemical synthesis of a plant virus genome, however, has not yet been reported. To achieve this mark, DNA was enzymatically synthesized from overlapping oligonucleotides based on the Goelet alphabetic rendering of TMV and was then transcribed into RNA that was artificially packaged into virions with purified TMV CP in vitro. The man-made virus particles encoding the Goelet sequence, a mutant thereof, and two viral chimeras were tested in plants.",

Sets of long-oligonucleotides were assembled to create 15, approximately 480 bp DNA modules (Figure 1) that were cloned in plasmids and sequenced. Only six clones for each construct needed to be screened to find at least one with a perfect module sequence, except in one case where it required the screening of 13 clones.

By contrast, the same amounts of RNA from DNA made by PCR amplification of the control plasmid pFL-TMV-NA, a known infectious TMV cDNA clone expressed by a T7 promoter [14,27], did produce local lesions on NN tobacco. FL-TMV-NA RNA, however, only produced 4 to 10 local lesions per leaf, which suggested low inoculation potential. Because TMV RNA is susceptible to nuclease degradation and is less infectious than packaged virus [28], the transcribed RNA was encapsidated in vitro with CP isolated from purified FL-TMV-NA virions. On the basis of the number of local lesions, encapsidation improved the infectivity of control FL-TMV-NA RNA by three to five times (purified CP preparations by themselves did not produce symptoms). The CP then was used to encapsidate 1-30 RNA, but the preparation still did not produce local lesions on NN tobacco or mosaic symptoms on Xanthi nn tobacco (SX), the classic systemic-symptom host. The experiment was repeated, but again 1-30 virus was not infectious.",

These substitutions have no detrimental effects on viral pathogenicity. pFL-TMV-NA also contains a G to A substitution at nucleotide position 832 (with respect to the Goelet sequence), which leads to an E instead of G at amino acid position 255 in the replicase (Figure 2).

This time, synthetic virions of 1-34CE-30 produced classic mosaic symptoms on SX and local lesions on NN tobacco (Figure 3A,C,D). Viral cDNAs amplified from local lesions encoded CE amino acids, but they did not contain the G to A polymorphism at nucleotide position 832. Therefore, the virus causing the symptoms was derived from the synthetic 1-34CE-30 DNA molecule and not FL-TMV-NA virions used to manufacture the CP preparation.",

            "text": "It has been known since the 1950s that the CPs from tobamoviruses like Holmes ribgrass virus can transencapsidate homologous TMV RNA in vitro[30]. At the time of discovery, the results inspired the question whether CP genes were interchangeable among tobamoviruses, but it took the advent of molecular biological techniques to test the idea. In an early report of plant viral genome recombination, an infectious cDNA of ToMV was engineered to express the CP gene of TMV [31]. The feat, however, required the generation of separate cDNAs for ToMV and TMV, restriction endonuclease mapping, subcloning, and site-directed mutagenesis with phage to create a chimera that had additional sequence alterations in the MP gene and the CP promoter [31]. Here, using more precise synthetic techniques, the interchangeability of CPs was revisited. The ORF sequences for the 1-34CE-30 CP gene and the ToMV CP gene were swapped within a text file, and 10 corresponding long-oligonucleotides were synthesized. Full-length DNA was amplified from perfect plasmid clones for two new modules, and RNA was transcribed and encapsidated in vitro. The chimera synthetic virus 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 produced local lesions on Xanthi NN within 5 days (Figure 3D) and mosaic symptoms on Xanthi SX within 7 days. The rapid systemic infection in SX indicated that the ToMV CP complemented long-distance transport function in lieu of the TMV CP [32]. Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of ToMV CP distinguishing peptides in the NN local lesions, and this evidence also verified that the symptoms were not a result of contaminating FL-TMV-NA from the CP preparation (Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed ToMV CP encapsidation of the chimera virus progeny in Xanthi SX (Figure 3E).",

N\u2019 encodes a protein with a coiled-coil domain, nucleotide binding site, and a leucine-rich repeat like many other plant disease resistance genes [33]. The elicitor of N\u2019 was mapped indirectly to the ToMV CP gene by Saito et al.[31], who replaced the ToMV CP with an homologous TMV CP gene restriction fragment in an infectious ToMV clone and observed the loss of N\u2019 elicitation. Around the same time, Dawson and colleagues [34,35] showed that some RNA mutations in the TMV CP gene were sufficient for eliciting N\u2019, and their data also indirectly implicated the ToMV CP gene in elicitation. It was later affirmed that variants of TMV CP, and not TMV CP gene RNA, indeed elicited N\u2019[36,37], but the same has never been shown for ToMV CP, although this is a technicality since the results for mutant TMV CP clearly implicate ToMV CP as well. Nevertheless, it was necessary to examine synthetic chimera 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 virus on N. sylvestris to confirm the hypothesis that it would exhibit a ToMV-like phenotype. So leaf extract from 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 virus-infected Xanthi SX was inoculated to N. sylvestris. Local lesions appeared within 3 days (Figure 3F). By comparison, 1-34CE-30 virus produced systemic symptoms, but no local lesions on N. sylvestris. Thus, this experiment directly demonstrates that the N\u2019 elicitor is included within the coding region of the ToMV CP gene.",

TMV and ToMV also can be distinguished by the symptoms they produce on Nicotiana benthamiana. For example, 1-34CE-30 virus caused severe epinasty, chlorosis, curling, and lethal systemic leaf and stem necrosis (Figure 4). Symptoms by ToMV were less severe by comparison, but still detrimental (Figure 4). Symptoms produced by chimera virus 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 on N. benthamiana were more similar to those produced by ToMV (Figure 4). DNA sequencing of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) products from infected N. benthamiana revealed no sequence mutations in 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30. Therefore, these results appeared to implicate the TMV/ToMV CP genes in symptomology in N. benthamiana, reminiscent of the way they did in N. sylvestris. Confounding a final conclusion, however, was the ORF6 gene, which overlaps the TMV MP and CP genes. Since TMV ORF6 has been implicated in symptomology [10], it was possible that the slightly milder symptoms of ToMV were attributed to ToMV ORF6, which is shorter than and divergent to TMV ORF6, especially in the carboxyl terminus region, which is encoded within the overlapping CP gene (Figure 5A). Similarly, the ToMV-like symptoms of 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 virus may have been attributed to the hybrid ORF6 arising from replacing the coding region of the TMV CP gene with the coding region of the ToMV CP gene; the final 16 of 34 amino acids of the hybrid ORF6 are derived from ToMV as well. To determine the role of hybrid ORF6 in symptomology, the codons for the first two methionines of ORF6 were mutated to eliminate potential translational starts (the mutations were silent to the MP). Symptoms for the new virus, 1-34CE-ToMVnoorf6-30, were even milder on N. benthamiana compared to the other viruses with functional ORF6 genes (Figure 4). DNA sequencing of RT-PCR products confirmed that the ORF6 translational start mutations were retained; no mutations were found in the rest of the viral genome. Mass spectrometry verified the production of ToMV CP (Table 1). Thus, while it is not ruled out that ToMV CP is not a symptom determinant in N. benthamiana, it is clear that ORF6 is. The results imply that the carboxyl end of ORF6 that overlaps the TMV CP gene influences symptoms the most. The results also reveal that unnatural hybrid proteins created by viral genome synthesis can unpredictably alter disease symptoms.",

Although barley, Hordeum vulgare cv. Black Hulless, is a natural host for BSMV but not TMV, it was demonstrated that in the presence of a mixed infection with BSMV, TMV RNA transencapsidated by BSMV CP could be recovered from upper leaves of barley [38,39]. It can be hypothesized from these results that the BSMV CP aids the systemic spread of TMV in barley, but the role for BSMV CP in extending the host range of TMV has remained unknown since the 1970s. To examine this, oligonucleotides were designed from the BSMV CP gene text and used to replace the TMV CP gene to create 1-34CE-BSMV CP-30 DNA. This design also resulted in a truncated TMV ORF6 with just seven amino acids provided by the overlapping BSMV CP gene sequence (Figure 5A). The derivative chimera virus did not produce any symptoms on inoculated Xanthi SX leaves, but it did produce TMV-like localized necrosis on the inoculated leaves of N. benthamiana 3 weeks after infection. The virus moved systemically 1 week later and produced unique mosaic symptoms without the systemic necrosis and stunting previously seen with 1-34CE-30 or 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 viruses (Figures 4 and 6A). DNA sequencing of viral genome RT-PCR products from infected N. benthamiana revealed a single mutation, T to A at position 6,415 in the 3\u2032 untranslated terminal region. This mutation is uncommon among TMV isolates; it was not present in the template DNA modules and may have arisen from DNA or RNA polymerase error, or it may have evolved in the plant. BSMV CP distinguishing peptides were identified from the infected N. benthamiana by mass spectrometry (Table 1), and transmission electron microscopy confirmed BSMV CP encapsidation of the chimera virus (Figure 6B). Together these results imply that the unique symptoms were a result of the BSMV CP or the hybrid ORF6, although the point mutation cannot be discounted. Infected N. benthamiana leaves were used as inocula for Xanthi NN and barley. Local lesions appeared on Xanthi NN within 4 days, but after several attempts at inoculating and then growing barley for 3 weeks at 30\u00b0C as described for mixed infections [38], the viral chimera could not be identified by RT-PCR from upper leaves. So, even though this chimera does not explain the spread of TMV in barley in a mixed infection with BSMV [38,39], it does, like the previous TMV/ToMV chimera, reveal that synthetic chimera viruses can produce unexpected and unusual symptoms.",

Synthetic biology provides a means for proving whether a sequence is a true blueprint for life. To date, only a few viral sequences and a lone prokaryotic genomic sequence have been authenticated [17,40]. This cannot be said, however, for the original TMV sequence [8]. RNA transcribed from an enzymatically synthesized DNA template of the Goelet sequence is not infectious. The cause appears to be related to insertion/deletion polymorphisms not in most other TMV sequences. The polymorphisms lead to the translation of MR amino acids instead of CE amino acids at positions 186 and 187 of the 126 kDa and 183 kDa replicase components. It is possible that MR disrupts the replicase methyltransferase domain critical for interactions with host proteins or with the 3\u2032 end of TMV RNA [41-44]. The origins of the deleterious polymorphisms are not known with certainty, but it is unlikely that they were native to the TMV studied by Goelet et al. Thus, this report identifies a longstanding error in a model, reference sequence, but also proves that a corrected sequence sustains biological replication (Figure 3C).",

The chimera virus, 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30, moved systemically through tobacco, and this verified that ToMV CP can complement the long-distance transport function of the TMV CP. Furthermore, the chimera, as expected, produced ToMV-like local lesions rather than TMV-like systemic mosaic in N. sylvestris (Figure 3F). The local lesions, controlled by N\u2019, were elicited by ToMV CP translated from the inserted gene. This insertion, however, also created a hybrid ORF6 gene overlapping the reading frames of the TMV MP gene and the exchanged ToMV CP gene (Figure 5A). Unexpectedly, the novel, hybrid ORF6 protein contributed to symptom severity in another plant, N. benthamiana (Figure 4).",

Thus, transencapsidation of TMV by BSMV in barley may only be a consequence of mixed infection and may not explain spread in the non-host [39]. It is possible that the BSMV triple-gene-block, which is analogous in function to the TMV MP, is needed to support the spread of TMV in barley [45]. Nevertheless, 1-34CE-BSMV CP-30 virus did spread systemically through N. benthamiana and produced unique mosaic symptoms instead of TMV-like systemic necrosis (Figure 6A). It is possible that the novel symptoms were a result of replacing the TMV CP with the BSMV CP, which also led to a potential truncated TMV/BSMV hybrid ORF6 protein (Figure 5A). Thus, it should be clear that the inconspicuous ORF6 and its unnatural derivatives created by synthetic recombination can have pathological consequences. Embedded in the TMV genome are several other small ORFs that have not been examined for pathological importance, possibly because of the past difficulty of using traditional molecular biology techniques to decouple these potential ORFs from the critical replicase, MP, and CP genes in which they are embedded. It should be feasible to use synthetic biology to restructure the ORFs in the TMV genome and separate the genetic responsibilities of these potential, undiscovered genes much in the same way the bacteriophage genome was refactored [20,21].",

These genomes were usually maintained in DNA plasmids or were circularized for infectivity. By contrast, with the exception of the non-infectious Goelet replica, the synthetic DNA templates of the infectious plant viruses studied here were not maintained in bacterial plasmids. As linear DNA molecule templates, they are benign and incapable of natural biological replication either in bacteria or plants. Because TMV is an RNA virus, synthetic RNA needed to be transcribed in vitro from DNA. To improve infectivity, virions were constituted in vitro by combining the synthetic RNA with purified TMV CP; virion formation was confirmed by electron microscopy (Figure 3A). These particles may be considered to be the first synthetic virions because they were assembled in vitro from purified CP and synthetic RNA transcribed from synthetic DNA in the absence of potential host factors [19], although there is opportunity yet to supersede this achievement by formulating fully synthetic virus components entirely by macromolecular chemistry. That detail is trivial, however, compared to the more poignant observation that these man-made plant viruses with simple mutations and recombined genomes altered symptoms in both expected and unexpected ways, portending the ramifications of the artificial manufacture of inherently stable infectious entities [25]. Consequently, all plants and experimental materials that came into contact with synthetic virions and progeny were appropriately disposed.",

Concentrations of soluble protein were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Soluble protein (300 \u03bcg) was reduced, derivatized, digested in trypsin and analyzed by reverse phase-tandem mass spectrometry as previously detailed [51]. Tandem mass spectra were analyzed with Mascot 2.4.0 against virus protein records in the NCBI NR protein sequence database. Peptides with P-values less than 0.05 were accepted. Spectra matching viral peptides were confirmed not to have equivalent or better matches to plant protein records in NR. Tandem mass spectrometry data (RAW files) are archived at [52].",
