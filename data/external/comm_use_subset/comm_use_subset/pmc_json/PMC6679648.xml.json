The AstV genome is 6.2\u20137.8 kb in size and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end. It presents at least three open reading frames (ORF): ORF1a, ORF1ab, and ORF2. ORF1a and ORF1ab encode nonstructural precursor proteins, nsp1a, and nsp1ab. The latter is translated via a ribosomal frameshift mechanism, where ORF1b is translated together with ORF1a (Marczinke et al., 1994). ORF2 encodes the capsid precursor protein, which is then intra- and extracellularly further processed to mature structural proteins (Willcocks et al., 1994).",

Due to the availability of high throughput next-generation-sequencing (NGS) technologies and the use of broadly reactive Pan-AstV RT-PCR protocols, there has been a remarkable increase in the number of AstV discovered in diverse species during the last years (Boujon, Koch & Seuberlich, 2017). AstV were first described in 1975 in a human stool sample (Appleton & Higgins, 1975; Madeley & Cosgrove, 1975). In humans, AstV are best known as a major source of outbreaks of gastroenteritis, especially in infants, young children and immunocompromised people (De Benedictis et al., 2011; Fischer, Pinho Dos Reis & Balkema-Buschmann, 2017). However, intestinal tissue infected with AstV shows only minor histological changes such as a mild intestinal inflammatory response (Sebire et al., 2004) and the knowledge on the pathogenesis of gastroenteric disease associated with AstV is still limited (Moser & Schultz-Cherry, 2005).",

Even though the presence of ovine astroviruses (OvAstV) in fecal sheep samples constituted the first report of AstV in animals (Snodgrass & Gray, 1977), still little is known about AstV infections in small ruminants, their transmission within and across species as well as their association with disease. In recent years a wide variety of mammalian domestic animal species were found positive for AstV in their feces; for example, cattle (Woode & Bridger, 1978), sheep (Snodgrass & Gray, 1977), red deer (Tzipori, Menzies & Gray, 1981), takins (Guan et al., 2018) and also domestic carnivores (Hoshino et al., 1981; Williams, 1980), mice (Kjeldsberg & Hem, 1985), and pigs (Bridger, 1980), but their role in the context of disease remained largely unclear. Remarkably, almost at the same time as the discovery of the first AstV-associated encephalitis in humans, the so-called shaking mink syndrome was described, which could be traced back to neurovirulent AstV infection (Blomstrom et al., 2010). One year later, in 2011, a neurovirulent porcine AstV type 3 could be identified as the cause of disease in outbreaks of meningoencephalomyelitis in piglets (Arruda et al., 2017; Boros et al., 2017).",

For the goats, all three novel CapAstV strains clustered in different branches of the phylogenetic tree. CapAstV-G2.1 and CapAstV-G3.1 are both related to two different BoAstV strains: BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido 11-55/2009 (p-dist. 0.293) and BoAstV-B170/HK (p-dist. 0.361), respectively.

Partial sequences generated from goat feces cluster together with the here described CapAstV/OvAstV or with enterotropic strains from other ruminants. In the partial sequences generated from sheep and deer feces, the situation is similar to the one described in goats. As previously indicated, one partial sequence, S3.1, is not clustering close to other enterotropic AstV but rather near the neurotropic BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 cluster. In samples with multiple AstV hits, partial sequences cluster at different positions of the phylogenetic tree. OvAstV-S5.1 clusters together with CapAstV-G5.1/OvAstV-S6.1 and S4.1, while scaffold S5.2, detected in the same sample, clusters together with sequences from sample G8 (G8.3/G8.5).",

Subsequent to the phylogenetic analysis, the five new AstV sequences were analyzed together with selected AstV strains for plausible recombination events. Three putative recombination events were reported (Table S4).

All three sequences may be the recombinant. Recombination event 3 was predicted to the overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b, whereas recombination event 1 was predicted for almost the entire ORF2.

None of these samples could be defined as positive for BoAstV-CH13 or BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16. Thus, there is no evidence that neurotropic AstV are part of the intestinal virome of small ruminants. Noteworthy, limitations of this study are the relative small number of samples investigated, the unknown disease status of the animals and the focus mainly on sheep and goats due to a lack of available samples from other ruminant species.

Therefore, this RT-PCR uses highly degenerated primers, which has the limitations that (i) it may lack sensitivity; due to absence or inefficiency of primer binding to divergent AstV sequences and that (ii) unspecific primer binding may result in amplification of non-AstV sequences. On the one hand, as only RT-PCR positive samples were submitted to NGS, fecal samples containing divergent AstV strains may have been classified as false negative and therefore might have been excluded from further analysis. On the other hand, false positive samples may have been further analyzed by NGS. Indeed, seven RT-PCR positive samples did not reveal any AstV hit in the bioinformatics pipeline.

This may be due to the low viral load or PCR inhibitors in small ruminants\u2019 feces that interfere with amplification. The importance of this finding is so far unclear. With an identity of 57% on the amino acid level to BoAstV-CH13, this putative AstV would be part of the so-called human-mink-ovine-like clade, which also comprises the fecal OvAstV-1 strain as well as the vast majority of encephalitis-associated strains in humans and animals (Kapoor et al., 2009; Reuter, Pankovics & Boros, 2018). Given the fact that only a part of the sequence (967 nt) could be determined, it is still possible that this virus shows varying identities depending on the genome section compared to other viral sequences. However, the importance of a potential occurrence of a novel and divergent neurotropic AstV in this fecal sample could not be definitively elucidated.",

Indeed, sequence similarities compared to best hits in the database entries on protein-level were between 39.3% and 96.4 % (median 72.7%). A total of 15 scaffolds covered at least a part of the ORF2 and therefore underwent phylogenetic analysis based on the capsid protein precursor sequence together with the five newly identified full-length or almost full-length AstV genomes (Fig. 2). This analysis clearly points out the broad diversity of putative AstV detected in this study. Novel sequences were not only discovered in sheep and goat, but also in deer (D2.1, D5.1), interestingly showing a low similarity to known AstV in deer (CcAstV-1/DNK/2010, CcAstV-2/DNK/2010). In addition, several sequences found in sheep show a clearly higher identity to bovine AstV than to ovine AstV (e.g., S6.3* to BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido12-25/2009). Taken together, these results clearly suggest a much larger diversity of AstV in small ruminants and deer than known to date. Moreover, the occurrence of multiple phylogenetically different AstV-like scaffolds in the same sample in most of these animals (e.g., in G1, G8 and S6) supports that AstV coinfections are frequent.",

Noteworthy, this study reports for the first time an AstV infection in goats. Based on the genetic distances of the capsid protein precursor sequences to the closest related strains, these caprine and OvAstV are grouped into three different genotype species. According to the ICTV 9th report 2011 (Bosch et al., 2011), amino acid differences between AstV genotype species are >0.338. Based on this criterion, the strains described in this study belong to three AstV genotype species: (i) CapAstV-G2.1 together with BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido 11-55/2009, (ii) CapAstV-G3.1 on its own, and (iii) CapAstV-G5.1 together with OvAstV-S5.1 as well as OvAstV-S6.1. While CapAstV-G2.1 belongs to the same genotype species as BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido 11-55/2009, CapAstV-G3.1 is sufficiently diverse to build a new genotype species on its own. In particular, CapAstV-G5.1 and OvAstV-S6.1 were very similar to each other, not only in the capsid protein sequence (97.3%), but also in the predicted non-structural proteins (90.3%) and on full-length genome nucleotide level (87.6%) (Table S3). The high similarity between these viruses raises the question of transmission events between sheep and goats and is reminiscent of the situation observed for BoAstV-CH15 and OvAstV-CH16 in AstV-associated encephalitis (Boujon et al., 2017).",

In the present study, recombination events were forecast between ovine and caprine strains as well as between caprine and bovine strains. Not only was recombination predicted for OvAstV-S6.1, OvAstV-S5.1 and CapAstV-G5.1, but also for CapAstV-G2.1 and two divergent bovine AstV (BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido11-55/2009, BAstV-GX27/CHN/2014), suggesting that these viruses (or close relatives to those strains) shared the same host at some time point during evolution (Fig. 3; Table S4). Similar recombination events have been proposed between a porcine AstV and HAstV-3 (Ulloa & Gutierrez, 2010). In addition, the transmission of fecal AstV between cattle and roe deer has been suggested (Smits et al., 2010; Tse et al., 2011). Taken together, all these data challenge the assumption that mammalian AstV are strictly host specific. The host-specificity of Astroviridae was already challenged in previous studies (Chu et al., 2010; Karlsson et al., 2015; Rivera et al., 2010).",
