In 1998 and 2005, S. suis 2 human infections, with the new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), had been reported in China, following the outbreaks in swine stocks initially, which caused a total of 240 human infections and claimed 52 lives [4]. Our group, in collaboration with other groups, has sequenced the entire genomes of the representatives of these two virulent S. suis 2 isolates (05ZYH33 and 98HAH12) in 2007 [5] and laid the foundation for the study of the STSS-causing S. suis 2 at the molecular level to reveal its pathogenicity [1], [6], [7].",

For instance, manganese plays a primary antioxidant role in bacteria [10] and affects bacterial pathogenesis [11]. Zinc is one of the most abundant metals in bacteria and is an essential co-factor of many metabolic enzymes and transcription factors [12]. The Mn2+ ion is characterized as hard metal and tends to prefer hard ligands, while zinc prefers soft ligands [13]. To obtain appropriate cellular concentrations of transition metal ions, bacteria have evolved elaborate machineries (such as ABC-transporters and ion channels) to transport these ions across biological membranes.",

However, only recently have insights emerged into the metal metabolism of S. suis. The adcR gene (which encodes the regulator of the Adc operon) was isolated by divalent cation deprivation [15]. Furthermore, the extracted cell surface proteins of S. suis from mutants defective in genes regulating metal ion uptake are able to confer significant protection against S. suis 2 infection in mice [16]. Previously, we identified a global zinc-response regulator of the Zur family (zinc uptake regulator) from S. suis 2 [17], unveiling its relationship with zinc homeostasis in this organism. Whole-genome sequence analysis led to the proposition that S. suis expresses two putative transition metal transport systems, encoded by the Adc operon [15] and Tro operon (Table S1), consistent with the situation in many other bacterial pathogens that harbor several metal transporters.",

This protein belongs to a well-studied family, formerly designated as cluster 9 substrate binding protein (SBP) [19], but recently reclassified into the A-1 family of prokaryotic SBPs [20]. The SsTro operon contains five genes, an ATP-binding cassette metal transport system (troABCD) (encoding four proteins) and a transcriptional regulator (troR) (Fig. 1A). The crystal structures of some A-1 family SBPs have been determined over the past decade. These structures include Mn-specific SBPs (e.g.,TpTroA [21]\u2013[22], Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA [23], and Synechocystis 6803 MntC [24]), Zn-specific SBPs (e.g., S. pneumoniae AdcAII [25], Synechocystis 6803 ZnuA [26], [27], and S. pyogenes Lbp [28]) and Fe-specific SBPs (Streptococcus pyogenes MtsA [29]). They share a common structure of two (\u03b1/\u03b2)4 domains linked by a long helix, with the metal bound at the interface between the domains. Hazlett et al.\n[30] and Desrosiers et al.\n[31] revealed that TpTroA has high binding affinity for both Zn2+ and Mn2+, but Zn2+ is considered to be the primary substrate of TpTroA [32].",

When bound to metal, by CD spectra TpTroA does not undergo structural changes, however, T. pallidum ZnuA undergoes conformational changes when Zn2+ is loaded [31]. Synechocystis 6803 ZnuA displays concomitantly large conformational changes in two of its three chelating histidines due to the release of Zn because it possesses two Zn binding sites [27]. However, the second binding site is absent in other transporters (e.g., TpTroA), and therefore its exact biological function remains unclear [33]. To obtain further insight into the function of SsTroA, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the Zn2+-bound form of the SsTroA at a resolution of 2.6 \u00c5, and further characterized the recombinant SsTroA. Binding of divalent metal cations to SsTroA, induces a substantial conformational reorganization to a more ordered state. Our structural and functional data reported here lay out the scenario of SsTroA participating in S. suis divalent metal homeostasis.",

Its presumptive lipobox sequence is LGAC, containing the indispensible cysteine in position 30, indicating that SsTroA is not released into the environment but rather inserted into the plasma membrane via a diacylglyceryl anchor.

Samples collected from elution fractions were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1A) and the results show that SsTroA has a molecular mass of \u223c34 kDa, in consistence with the theoretical monomer molar mass of 32 kDa. An analytical FPLC Superdex\u00ae 200 profile revealed that SsTroA exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer in solution, though mainly as a monomer (Fig. S2A). To determine the native mass of SsTroA (unaffected by protein shape), quantitative hydrodynamic analyses were performed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Analysis of the sedimentation velocity profiles using the SEDFIT program yielded the weight average molar mass of the major peak is 31.8 kDa (Figure S2B), which accounts for 90% of the total protein (i.e., nearly identical to the theoretical molar mass of 32 kDa). Another peak at 62.6 kDa (6.8% of the total) is believed to correspond to dimers. The other \u223c3.2% of the protein has a significantly-higher sedimentation coefficient, but the amount of this subpopulation did not change significantly as a function of protein concentration. Thus, our data suggest that under the solution conditions used, a small portion of SsTroA is involved in the formation of stable complexes. This is consistent with the evidence that periplasmic SBPs exist in a monomer/dimer equilibrium, with monomers having higher affinity for the substrate [36], [37].",

ITC measures the heat directly released or absorbed upon an interaction triggered by mixing two components, and is capable of calculating both the extent of the ligand binding affinity and the free energy values (\u0394G) and enthalpy(\u0394H) changes, from which entropy (\u0394S) is determined [38]. The isotherms for loading with Zn2+ and Mn2+ appeared in normal sigmoidal titration curves, in agreement with our ICP-MS data. Again the binding stoichiometry (n) was determined to be \u223c1 in both cases (Fig. 2), confirming that a specific 1\u22361 complex is formed in each case. The association constants (Ka) for each metal ion binding to SsTroA were around 107 M\u22121 (Fig. 2). SsTroA affinities for Zn2+ and Mn2+ were calculated from duplicate measurements with KDs ( = 1/Ka) of 434\u00b19 nM and 254\u00b113 nM, respectively, indicating the formation of tight complexes. It should be noted that SsTroA binds Mn2+ with a higher affinity than that of Zn2+. These values are of a similar magnitude to those described for binding of Zn2+ and Mn2+ to N. gonorrhoeae MntC [33]. In each metal ion titration with both metal ions, we observed negative enthalpy and entropy values, demonstrating that binding of each ion to SsTroA is an exothermic event. The thermodynamic profiles for metal binding by SsTroA are not identical to those previously reported for TpTroA [31]. Intrinsic metal binding to proteins is usually entropically driven (\u0394H>0) due to the very high dehydration energies of divalent cations. However, the binding enthalpy can become exothermic (\u0394H<0) if metal binding is coupled to a protein conformational change [39], [40]. Our ITC data are consistent with a significant conformational change observed in our nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and CD spectra. Thermodynamic parameters for the binding of Zn2+/Mn2+ to SsTroA are summarized in Table S2.",

The X-band EPR spectra of Mn2+-SsTroA at room temperature displays a typical six-line pattern (Fig. 3A). High-spin Mn2+ centers typically exhibit EPR resonances with characteristic six-line splitting patterns due to hyperfine interactions between the unpaired electrons and the I = 5/2 55Mn nucleus, indicating the binding of the Mn2+ to the protein [42]. Upon entrance of the Mn2+ into the binding site, the Mn2+ bound protein reduces the coordination of weakfield water, increasing spin-orbit interactions and zero-field energies relative to that of Mn(H2O)6\n2+. As observed, both titration traces had similar spectra but with varying intensities of the signal.

Interaction of the probe with a hydrophobic site yields an enhancement of fluorescence intensity, usually accompanied by a blue shift of the maximum. SsTroA significantly enhances the emission intensity of ANS and promotes a blue shift (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of ANS clearly decreases in the metal bound form compared to the apo-SsTroA. As indicated by the diminished fluorescence, ANS displays stronger binding to Mn2+-SsTroA than Zn2+ -SsTroA. The spectra clearly provide evidence that the addition of metal ions induces a large change in the nonpolarity of the ANS-binding site, and the Mn2+ causes a greater change than Zn2+ does. These data suggested that the decreased plots observed in the spectra (Fig. 3B) can be attributed to a more compact and ordered structure for SsTroA in the presence of metal.",

To obtain further information on the metal sensitivity of the SsTroA and details on possible structural changes occurring upon its interaction with metal ions, we applied CD spectroscopy to monitor these processes. Proteins were prepared by incubation with Zn2+ and Mn2+ as previously described [31]. In the far-UV regions (Fig. 4A), the CD spectra are generally characterized by distinct minima at 208 and 223 nm respectively, which are the features of proteins that contain \u03b1-helix conformational elements, consistent with the crystal structure data. The metal bound SsTroA samples both displayed spectra similar to apo-SsTroA, only with minor differences, though both has deeper 208 nm and 223 nm minima relative to apo-SsTroA. The intensity of the 223-nm band of SsTroA is in the order: apo-SsTroA>Zn2+-SsTroA>Mn2+-SsTroA, suggesting a decrease of the content of secondary structure in the apo form compared to the metal-bound forms. While previous work demonstrates that TpTroA does not manifest changes discernible by CD upon metal binding, in contrast, T. pallidum ZnuA does undergo conformational changes when Zn2+ is loaded [31].

As expected, thermal denaturation proceeded, as expected, with a sharp decrease in ellipticity at 223 nm at the melting temperature and a complete loss of secondary structure (Fig. 4B). The data are fit very well to a two-state model between the folded and unfolded states. Nonetheless, the unfolding profiles are obviously different, the heat denaturation analysis revealed that the apoprotein begins to dramatically lose CD signal at 60\u201365\u00b0C, whereas the Zn-bound or Mn-bound protein starts to significantly lose CD signal at a temperature as high as 65\u201370\u00b0C. The apoprotein exhibits a half-denaturation (Tm) of 71.5\u00b10.1\u00b0C, and addition of Zn2+ and Mn2+ significantly stabilizes SsTroA as judged by a substantial enhancement in the Tm value (\u0394Tm = 4.6\u00b10.2\u00b0C and 5\u00b10.1\u00b0C, respectively), which agrees with the presence of Zn2+ or Mn2+ as seen in CD spectroscopic changes (Fig. 4A). These results combined with CD spectrum data imply that the ternary protein-metal complex appears to form a compact domain organization, i.e., the metal-ligand interactions in the SsTroA protein indeed play an important role in imparting extra stability to the metal binding site of the protein. Further, as we proposed that Mn2+ has a more significant effect on the conformation and thermal stability of SsTroA than Zn2+.",

There exists difference with SBPs, specific either for zinc or manganese. In the Zn-specific ZnuAs, the metal is coordinated by 3 histidines plus a water or glutamate [44], [45]. In the case of Zn-specific AdcAII, the residues involved in Zn binding are three histidines and one glutamate [25]. This is similar to the observation in Zn-specific Lbp, the zinc ion is coordinated by the side chains of three histidines and one glutamate in a slightly distorted tetrahedral geometry [28]. In the Mn-specific SBPs (PsaA and MntC), the metal is coordinated via two hisitidine residues, the third histidine is replaced by a glutamate, and the fourth position is occupied by an aspartate [23], [24]. The coordination geometry of Zn is usually tetrahedral or distorted tetrahedral (coordination number = 4) in the protein, although the coordination number can increase to five to stabilize high-energy intermediates and their flanking transition states. In contrast, the Mn2+ ion tends to prefer hard ligands such as the carboxylate oxygens of aspartate or glutamate, and the carboxamide oxygens of asparagine or glutamine. The nitrogen atoms of histidine imidazole groups are occasionally observed as metal ligands in Mn2+ metalloenzymes despite their borderline hardness, the metal coordination geometry is usually square pyramidal or trigonal bipyramidal (coordination number = 5) [13]. Accordingly, our structure indicated that Mn2+ is likely to be the natural ligand. However, despite great efforts, we failed to obtain any crystals of SsTroA containing Mn2+.",

Such a result is consistent with the observation of T. pallidum, as suggested by Lee et al\n[22].",

Two dimensional Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra of Mn2+-SsTroA are shown in Figure 6B. The number of peaks was less than the expected number of amide groups, presumably due to the paramagnetic broadening effects (Mn2+ is a paramagnetic agent). The cross peaks, still visible after incubating with Mn2+, belong to protons distal from the Mn2+ binding site. By contrast, the broadening and disappearance of the cross-peak strongly indicates the involvement of the amide proton close to the Mn2+ coordination sphere. It should be noted that almost all of the peaks in the presence of Zn2+ and Mn2+ have similar chemical shifts (Fig. 6C), indicating that the protein regions adopt identical structures when bound to Zn or Mn. This suggests that Zn2+ and Mn2+ could bind to the SsTroA in similar positions, perhaps even the same site. A similar result is observed in N. gonorrhoeae MntC protein, where the Zn and Mn ions compete for the same site [33].",

One puzzling observation that was unclear until now is whether or not Zn and Mn bind to the same site in TpTroA. Nuclear spin relaxation properties of resonances from protons close to the ion-binding sites can be selectively perturbed in the presence of paramagnetic ions [50]. The unpaired electrons of Mn2+ can interact with protons close to Mn2+ and the effect of the strong paramagnetic interaction of the Mn cation leads to specific changes in the corresponding NMR signals, which helps to locate the Mn2+ binding site [51]. Our NMR data demonstrated that Zn2+-SsTroA and Mn2+-SsTroA have very similar tertiary structures. Introduction of Mn induced the disappearance of some cross-peaks and the loss of intensity of others. Moreover, the binding of metal ions induces chemical shift changes for some of the cross-peaks (highlighted in circles, Fig. 6). However, the Zn2+-SsTroA and Mn2+-SsTroA spectra are nearly identical (except for the cross-peaks that disappear from spectrum), indicating that Zn2+ and Mn2+ share the adjacent binding region or even the same site in SsTroA.",

From our combined NMR and ANS fluorescence data, we speculated that the metal-binding pocket of apo-SsTroA and other locally disordered folding adopts a loosely folded structure in solution. This behavior explains why metal-bound states induced the decreased ANS fluorescence intensity and changes in the NMR spectra of the metal-loaded forms. These loosely ordered structures may enhance an inducible response to the changing environmental conditions or may play a pivotal role in recognizing different divalent metal ions. In some cases, binding of a target molecule or ligand drives disordered folding to a more ordered state [52]. It should be noted that the crystallographic studies on TpTroA [21], [22] have referred to a comparatively minor folding movement upon the metal binding, and structural analysis of Escherichia coli ZnuA suggests that binding and release of Zn drive small yet significant conformational changes [45]. One explanation may be that the nature of protein in solution is shown to be more dynamic than suggested by crystal structures.",

The complex structure of BtuCD-BtuF revealed that the conserved glutamate residues Glu 74 and Glu 202 from BtuF form salt bridges with Arg56 residues from two BtuC subunits [55], which are also found in other ABC importers [56]. Moreover, these salt bridges are critical for molecular interaction in vivo [56]. Intriguingly, we found that SsTroA also has two conserved glutamate residues Glu 107 and Glu 230 that are positioned on the surface of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 5A).

Cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were homogenized in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) prior to sonication. The cell lysate was then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 35 000 g, the clarified supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare) for 2 hours, and bound proteins were cleaved from the resin by incubating with PreScission Protease in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction for batch purification. The resulting supernatant was directly loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl. The purified protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and high purity fractions containing SsTroA were concentrated using Amicon Ultra 15 centrifugal filters (Millipore) with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol using bovine serum albumin as the standard. To produce uniformly 15N-labeled SsTroA samples for NMR studies, E. coli BL21 (DE3) were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 0.1% 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole source of nitrogen. The other steps of protein expression and purification were the same as described above.",
