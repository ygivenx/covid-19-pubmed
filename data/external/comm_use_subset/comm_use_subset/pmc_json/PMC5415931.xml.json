HRV is already known to be one of the most frequently detected respiratory viruses in children (Monto & Sullivan, 1993; Martin, Fairchok et al., 2013). There are over 100 serotypes of HRV, which would contribute to the frequent repeated infections in young children (Bochkov et al., 2011). Recent studies have also shown that HRV is associated with lower respiratory tract infections, and it is one of the most important respiratory tract pathogens (Mackay, 2008). HRV infection may not be highly associated with fever as it was only present at a low rate on HRV-single-positive occasions (11.5 %, 3/26). In fact, in a previous study concerning febrile respiratory tract infections in Japanese paediatric outpatients, HRV was detected in 4.6 % of tested specimens, excluding influenza virus-positive patients (Hara et al., 2014). Despite being one of the most frequent respiratory virus infections for young children, most cases only experience mild symptoms.",

A follow-up study for a young child in this study also showed a high proportion of multiple virus-positive specimens in both symptomatic and asymptomatic periods, supporting previous findings. However, the effect of multiple viral infections on the severity of clinical signs is uncertain as described previously (Goka et al., 2013).",

Virus detection by PCR was not always associated with clinical symptoms, and the effect of bacterial infections is uncertain. Despite the limitations of our study, this long-term follow-up research demonstrated that one young child was infected by many respiratory viruses when living in a group context. This study also provides baseline data that demonstrate that young children have a high risk of respiratory virus infection, particularly HRV, in nursery schools. A follow-up study of more children, with precise viral identification (typing), analyses of clinical symptoms and a consideration of bacterial detection, would be helpful to understand respiratory infections in young children. Additional epidemiological data may also help to prevent severe respiratory virus infections and facilitate the development of a vaccine(s).",
