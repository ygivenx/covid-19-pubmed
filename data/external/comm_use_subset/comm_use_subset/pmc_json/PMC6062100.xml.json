            "text": "How the sfRNA is made in the infected cells is intriguing. Several studies have shown that the sfRNA is a product of the incomplete degradation of the viral genome by cellular 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 exoribonuclease XRN1; a pseudoknot or a three-helix junction structure in the 3\u2019 UTR is responsible for stalling XRN1 degradation [8, 23\u201326]. This cleavage happened within a few minutes when carried out in vitro, and there were no intermediate byproducts during the exoribonuclease degradation process of the viral genome to the sfRNA in the virus-infected cells, which indicated that the degradation process is extremely efficient or that another biogenesis mechanism might be involved. The reason for these findings is not clear because degradation from the full-length genome seems uneconomic for viruses from an evolutionary point of view. Furthermore, being infected with RNA viruses induces double membrane vesicles to form replication/transcription complexes that are protease- and nuclease-resistant [27\u201329]. The reason for such abundant levels of viral genome within the membrane-protected complex subjected to RNA degradation remains unclear. Although RdRp has no proofreading activity, considering the high molar ratio of the sfRNA to the genome (1.25\u20135.14 in mosquito cells and 0.25\u20131.5 in mammalian cells) [9], the possibility that large portions of the synthesized genome are dysfunctional and subjected to degradation pathways is elusive. It may just be that the RNA turnover by XRN1 exoribonucleases is quite normal but that sfRNA accumulates because it is degradation resistant.",

Furthermore, the minus-strand templates covering the putative promoter region used for an in vitro RdRp assay gave rise to synthetic products, suggesting that the JEV sfRNA could be initially transcribed from the antigenome and may be further trimmed by XRN1 or other unidentified exoribonucleases.",

Approximately 60 pmol of triphosphated RNAs were incubated with 20 units of RNA 5\u2019 pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH, NEB) at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours to generate 5\u2019-monophosphated RNA. The RppH-treated RNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Next, 500 ng of the monophosphated RNA was digested with the indicated amount of XRN1 (NEB) or RNase A (Qiagen) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. 200 ng of RNA was then separated in a formaldehyde-containing 1.5% agarose gel and hybridized to a riboprobe as indicated.",

Knocking-down (KD) the XRN1 expression by up to 95% in HEK293T cells continued to increase the abundance of sfRNA throughout the 48-h infection period. More sfRNA (121%) was observed in XRN1 knocked-down cells than in the wild-type (WT) cells (Fig 1A). It should be noted that there were no decay intermediates between viral genome and the sfRNA even in the XRN1-deficient cells. Similar results were also observed in A549 cells infected with JEV (Fig 1B), whereas DENV infection caused a slight reduction of sfRNA accumulation in the XRN1-KD cells (Fig 1C). Statistical analysis of JEV sfRNA accumulation in XRN1-KD cells among three independent experiments showed about 112.5% \u00b1 8.5% at 48 h post infection. No statistically significant differences in the amount of the sfRNA were detected in the infected cells at any time in relation to the depletion of XRN1. These results indicated that either the exoribonuclease XRN1 in JEV-infected cells could be extremely active, such that the residual XRN1 (4\u20135%) might be sufficient to digest the JEV genome or that another nuclease or mechanism might be involved in the formation of sfRNA. To rule out the possibility that the residual XRN1 may contribute to the formation of sfRNA, we performed the experiments using XRN1 knock-out (KO) cells. As shown in Fig 1D, sfRNA accumulated abundantly in XRN1-KO cells infected with either JEV or DENV indicating that XRN1 does not play a direct role for the formation of sfRNA in vivo.",

To investigate the structure requirements for the production of JEV sfRNA in vivo, we performed mutagenesis studies in the context of a JEV infectious clone (in the S1 Text and S1 Table). The structure of the JEV 3\u2019 UTR is diagramed in Fig 2A. Although equal amounts of cDNA (250 ng) for all mutants were transfected into BHK-21 cells, according to immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Northern hybridization results at 5 days post-transfection (dpt), the replication efficiency of the cDNA from different mutants varied (data not shown). These results suggest that the mutations made in these regions delayed the completion of the viral life cycle. We therefore collected the supernatant and measured the virus titers at the time when the cells showed strong CPE that varied from 4 to 11 dpt for different mutants (Table 1). We then used equal amounts of MOI at 0.1 for each recombinant virus to infect BHK-21 cells and analyzed the RNA synthesis at 48 h post-infection (hpi). A deletion that spanned nt 10423\u201310729 (\u0394307) abolished the viral replication (Fig 2C, lane 3), while the deletion of the AU-rich region (\u0394AU-rich) or the 5\u2019-stemloop (\u03945\u2019-SL) slightly delayed viral replication but had no lasting effect on the viral replication overall or on the sfRNA accumulation (Fig 2C, lanes 4\u20135 and Table 1).",

However, deletion of the CYC-like motif had no effect on the synthesis of the sfRNA and the genome (Fig 2C, lane 6), whereas deletion of the entire SLII abolished the production of sfRNA (Fig 2C, lane 7). Meanwhile, deletion of the lower left stemloop of the SLII (\u0394SLII.1), the upper stemloop (\u0394SLII.2) or the lower left stem (\u0394SLII.3) all impaired sfRNA synthesis (Fig 2C, lanes 8\u201310), indicating that the SLII structure is essential for sfRNA accumulation. Three point mutations disrupted base pairing of the first pseudoknot at the 3\u2019 UTR (PK1\u2019 or PK1\u201d) prevented sfRNA formation (Fig 2C, lanes 11\u201312), while compensatory changes restoring the PK pairing (PK1\u20191\u201d) recovered the sfRNA synthesis (Fig 2C, lane 13) suggesting that pseudoknot structure is also required for the sfRNA formation. To further demonstrate that the production of sfRNA requires the PK structure but does not rely on the activity of exoribonuclease XRN1, PK1\u20191\u201d and PK1\u201d mutants were used to infect WT or XRN1-KD HEK293T cells, and then the resulting effects were compared. Disruption of the PK structure (PK1\u201d) abolished the sfRNA production in WT as well as in XRN1-KD cells, while compensatory changes that maintained the PK structure (PK1\u20191\u201d) made no difference in the production of sfRNA in XRN1-KD cells or in WT cells (Fig 2D), indicating that the requirement of the PK structure for the production of sfRNA does not rely on the activity of exoribonuclease XRN1.",

Purified RdRp protein (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 \u03bcM) retarded the migration of the (-)10431-10566 RNA in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no band shift was observed with non-specific RNA or BSA control (Fig 4A). It should be noted that the additional band above the RNA/protein complex (RPC) (Fig 4A, lanes 1\u20133) is inversely correlated to the occurring of RPC suggesting that the highly ordered RNA secondary structure may have intermolecular interactions when separated by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. This band is an indirect evidence of RdRp binding at this region. The intermolecular interactions were disrupted with increasing amounts of RdRp (Fig 4A, left panel). In contrast, the band remained the same when incubated with increasing amounts of BSA control (Fig 4A, right panel). Competition assays were performed to test the specificity of the interaction between the RdRp and the (-)10431-10566 RNA. Increasing amounts of unlabeled RNA out competed the RPC (Fig 4B, lanes 3\u20135). In contrast, neither tRNA (lanes 6\u20138) nor nonspecific RNA (lanes 9\u201311) competed away the RPC.

The result showed that the (+)1-160 RNA is a functional template for RNA synthesis whereas the 5\u2019 226-nt RNA from bovine coronavirus (as a nonspecific template control) could not direct RNA synthesis, nor the reaction without adding the RdRp (Fig 4C), indicating that the purified recombinant JEV RdRp has specific enzymatic activity. We then used the (-)10431-10566 RNA as the template for the RdRp assay. Two major synthetic products were detected, the larger band with 136 nt in length same as the size marker driven by T7 RNA polymerase, and the smaller band with 113 nts in length presumably a transcription product initiated from the putative promoter (Fig 4D, lane 7). We then constructed various templates for in vitro RdRp assays (Fig 4E and 4F and S1 Table). Interestingly, all constructs showed a de novo synthesis product same as the template size and a smaller band with approximately 113 nts in length except for the (-)10454-10566 RNA (Fig 4D and 4E).

The crystal structure of the xrRNAs in the 3\u2019 UTR that resist the degradation process has been determined [7, 23], and the function of the stalling has been studied in several flaviviruses [26, 36\u201338]. Although stalling of XRN1 by the JEV sfRNA has been reported previously [14], detailed mechanism of the sfRNA formation has not yet been elucidated. The results of this study showed that either knocking down or knocking out of XRN1 gave rise to more sfRNA accumulation in virus-infected cells (Fig 1A, 1B and 1D). It has also been reported that XRN1 could be redundant with other exonucleases in producing Zika virus sfRNAs [7]. These controversial results may be explained by several reasons including (i) exonucleases other than XRN1 can contribute to sfRNA formation, (ii) depletion of XRN1 causes changes in total cellular RNA level that may include products of endonucleolytic cleavage, and (iii) reduction in XRN1 may contribute to differences in susceptibility to viral infection [7]. Although we cannot vehemently rule out these possibilities, theoretically, exoribonuclease XRN1 depletion should reduce the production of the sfRNA, resulting in a reduction of the molar ratio of the sfRNA to the genome, yet an increase rather than a decrease in molar ratio was observed. Furthermore, no intermediate degradation byproducts from viral genome to the sfRNA were detected during infection even in the XRN1-deficient cells (Fig 1A\u20131D). Morevoer, several unsolved mysteries including the unreasonably high rate of nonsense-mediated decay to generate the sfRNA, the question of how the viral genome within the membrane-protected complex is subjected to RNA degradation, and the lack of economy in degradation from the full-length genome from an evolutionary point of view, led us to reconsider other possible mechanisms of the JEV sfRNA formation.",

We attempted to clarify the initiation site of the RdRp products by applying 5\u2019 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5\u2019 RACE) assays but failed to observe any specific sequences due to low amount of the radiolabeled products. Efforts had also been made to demonstrate that the putative promoter is functional in infected cells by transfecting RNA construct containing unrelated sequences under the control of the promoter. Unfortunately, our numerous attempts to make such a construct failed probably because the transfected molecule may not be accessible as a template to the viral RdRp at the right place and right time. It has been shown that the recombinant JEV NS5 exhibited a weak terminal transferase activity only when substrate ribonucleotides were limited [39]. Sufficient amounts of ribonucleotides were supplied in the in vitro RdRp assay (Fig 4C and 4D), thus the products are least likely resulting from the terminal transferase activity. Furthermore, in vitro digestion of the 3\u2019 UTR containing fragment (a 800-nt RNA) by XRN1 revealed that XRN1 could stall at a position to generate the sfRNA (Fig 1E). These results let us to propose the model that the JEV sfRNA is likely made by transcription initially and then could be further trimmed by XRN1 or other unidentified exoribonucleases (Fig 5).",

It has been shown in previous studies with WNV that the deletion of the 5\u2019 half of the 3\u2019 UTR does not affect the genome replication but does halt the sfRNA formation [8]. However, a similar deletion at the 3\u2019 UTR of JEV (\u0394307) totally killed virus replication (Fig 2C, lane 3). Whether a partial deletion of the dumbbell structure resulted in the lethal phenotype remains to be determined. It has been suggested that the subgenomic RNA promoter sequences often form a stem-loop structure, which is proposed to facilitate the interaction with the transcriptase as well as other host factors [40]. We found that deletion of the entire or any part of the SLII all impaired sfRNA synthesis (Fig 2C, lanes 7\u201310), indicating that the SLII structure is essential for sfRNA accumulation and could be a potential promoter for the sfRNA synthesis. Furthermore, pseudoknot structure on SLII is required for the formation of sfRNA in WNV, yellow fever virus (YFV), and ZIKV [7, 24, 25]. Our result also showed that pseudoknot structure is essential for the formation of sfRNA in JEV (Fig 2C, lanes 11\u201313). Interestingly, mutations made at the SLII region showed relatively smaller plaques and delayed viral maturation or release (Fig 2E and 2F). This observation may correlate with the report that sfRNA-deficient WNV displays significantly decreased infection and transmission rates in mosquitoes [21].",

Previous studies of YFV have shown that the sfRNA2 is indeed truncated at the 3\u2019-end [24]. It has been reported that the sfRNA2 only exists in certain isolates of the DENV-2 [6]. Filomatori et al. reported that the accumulation of different species of sfRNAs in DENV-2-infected vertebrate and invertebrate cells due to selective pressures act on the 3\u2019 UTR during host adaption [41]. Although smaller sfRNA species were found in JEV, sequences of these RNAs have not yet been determined. Nevertheless, deletion mutants made on the SLII structure abolished all sfRNA formation but did not give rise to smaller RNA species (Fig 2C). It is still unclear whether the downstream SLIV or the dumbbell structure on JEV genome plays a role in stalling of the XRN1. The mechanism for the formation of smaller JEV RNA species needs to be further characterized.",

A promoter element known as stemloop A (SLA) at the 5\u2019 end of the genome has been well studied with regard to its function in DENV and WNV [34, 35, 42]. The initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis includes the RdRp binding at the SLA at the 5\u2019 end of the genome and the relocation of the RdRp at the 3\u2019 initiation site by long-range RNA-RNA interactions [34, 43, 44]. In this study, we identified the SLII that showed promoter activity as good as the SLA promoter (Figs 2 and 4). We also found that the initiation site of JEV sfRNA located at a 3\u2019-cyclization-like motif. This CYC-like motif complementary to the 5\u2019 cyclization sequences may be involved in genome cyclization during antigenome synthesis and may cause template switching to occur, as reported by Maeda et al. [45]. However, deletion of the CYC-like motif had no effect on sfRNA accumulation in vivo (Fig 2C, lane 6). A potential role of this CYC-like motif remains to be studied.",
