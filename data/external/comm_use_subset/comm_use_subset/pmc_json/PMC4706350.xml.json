            "text": "Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) are X-linked recessive muscle-wasting diseases arising from mutations in the massive dystrophin gene (DMD) that leads to degeneration of muscle. DMD is the most prevalent and severe form of childhood muscle wasting with a cited incidence of 1 in 3,500 live-male births, whereas BMD is a clinically milder form of the disease with slower disease progression [1, 2]. BMD mutations may present with a spectrum of phenotypes, depending upon the nature and location of the DMD lesion, as BMD mutations do not usually disrupt the reading frame, thereby allowing production of an internally shortened but functional dystrophin. BMD patients remain ambulant until at least 16 years of age but, in some mild or asymptomatic cases, may only be diagnosed by accident or late in life [3, 4]. Conversely, intermediate muscular dystrophy has been used to describe \u201cmildly affected\u201d DMD patients (those whose genetic structure would predict prematurely truncated dystrophin and loss of ambulation by 12 years of age) or \u201cseverely affected\u201d BMD cases (those who would be expected to produce some functional dystrophin and therefore remain ambulant after 16 years of age). In 1989, Dubowitz stated that \u2018Intermediate DMD patients are defined as patients with a dystrophinopathy with onset of symptoms (of motor difficulties) by about 5 years of age, similar to the classical DMD patients but with a slower rate of disease progression, with loss of ambulation between 13 and 16 years of age.\u201d [5]. Children of the same age vary widely in clinical presentation, and patients that appear to have a milder dystrophinopathy have also been termed \"outliers.\" [6]",

Other in-frame deletions may have severe consequences, due to the loss of a crucial functional domain within dystrophin, eg the actin or beta-dystroglycan binding regions. Mutations in the 5\u2019 region of the DMD gene frequently manifest as exceptions to the reading frame rule [10], and various mechanisms have been proposed to impact on the consequences of these mutations, including re-initiation of translation [11] and splicing perturbations [12].",

In order to further evaluate a dystrophin isoform lacking the actin binding domain encoded by exon 5, we induced a transient dystrophinopathy model by skipping Dmd exon 5 in wild-type mice. Analysis of dystrophin, components of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, muscle architecture and isolated muscle function, reveals moderate dystrophic changes in diaphragm, intermediate between mdx and wild-type phenotypes. Excision of Dmd exon 5 greatly reduced dystrophin expression in mouse diaphragm and compromised muscle function.",

            "text": "Targeted exon skipping is emerging as a promising therapy to treat DMD, and at this time, the focus has been on exclusion of exons that flank frame shifting-deletions in order to re-frame the transcript. Similarly, removing an in-frame exon carrying an intra-exonic protein truncating mutation [14, 15], or a duplicated in-frame exon [16], would allow synthesis of functional dystrophin isoforms. The rationale is that re-framing the DMD transcript will produce a BMD-like isoform and reduce disease severity. Examination of BMD phenotype:genotype correlations can indicate DMD transcript structures most likely to generate functional dystrophin isoforms and therefore inform exon skipping strategies [17, 18]. We propose that removal of DMD exon 5 alone is unlikely to provide significant clinical benefit, and alternative exon skipping strategies or treatments should be considered for dystrophinopathy patients with mutations within exon 5, or those with duplications of exon 5.",

This sequence was synthesized as a PMO conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide for in vivo studies in wild type mice, with the aim to generate a transient Dmd exon 5 deletion in vivo model. A dystrophic phenotype, induced by skipping of Dmd exon 5 was evident in the diaphragms, although the dystrophic pathology was quite as marked as for the sham treated mdx mice. Immunostaining using the antibody, NCL-DYS2 to detect the carboxy terminus of dystrophin reflected patchy and greatly reduced staining in the diaphragm of 5-PPMOk treated C57BL/10 mice, compared to sham treated control C57BL/10 mice (Fig 4a, top row), and western blotting indicated that dystrophin levels were reduced to less than 10% of wild-type levels (data not shown). The reduced dystrophin staining was associated with reduced \u03b2-dystroglycan and nNOS expression in diaphragm of treated mice (Fig 4a, left panel), compared to levels in sham-treated control C57BL/10 mice (Fig 4a, central panel), whereas expression in mdx mouse diaphragm is very low. A modest degree of muscle regeneration in the diaphragm from 5-PPMOk- treated mice is indicated by the presence of developmental myosin heavy chain (dMHC) in muscle fibres (Fig 4a). Neither muscle regeneration nor fibrosis is evident in diaphragm from sham-treated C57BL10 mice, whereas abundant dMHC staining, fibrosis revealed by Picro-sirius Red staining and central nucleation is apparent in the 5-PPMOk treated C57BL10 and in the sham treated mdx mice, and is consistent with a moderate dystrophic muscle phenotype.",

Detailed examination of causative mutations in cases that are \u2018reading frame exceptions\u2019 have revealed several mechanisms that account for a discrepancy between DMD genotype and clinical phenotype. In-frame exonic deletions may result in a severe phenotype if the deletion involves more than 25 exons in [32]) or results in the loss of a crucial functional motif, eg that encoding the beta-dystroglycan binding domain or the first 20 exons [32]. Protein truncating mutations in the 5\u2019 region can lead to re-initiation of translation in exons 5, 6 or 8 and synthesis of a functional dystrophin [11] [33]. Secondary RNA processing events, not apparent by analysis of the DNA, may influence exon selection and processing of the transcript. Nonsense mutations in some of the in-frame exons encoding the dystrophin rod domain manifest with a milder than expected phenotype due to natural skipping of the mutated and splice compromised exon [34] [35].",

The patient that we describe had a genomic deletion of only exon 5, and RNA analysis indicated that only that exon was missing from the DMD mRNA. We hypothesize that the size and/or location of this particular in frame deletion, 10.8kb compared to the 7.78 and 3.84 kb deletions identified in the other exon 5 deletion patients [13], may have contributed to the processing of dystrophin exons during splicing. Gualandi and colleagues [13] proposed that a 2.1 kb block of sequence, immediately upstream of exon 6 and common to both DMD exon 5 deletion patients, influences splice site selection and the novel fusion introns favour exon 6 skipping. This possibility no longer seems likely since the deletion breakpoint in our patient is located between those in the DMD exon 5 deleted patients reported by Gualandi and colleagues [13].",

Since the deletion of exon 5 does not disrupt the reading frame, but nevertheless the relative amounts of dystrophin were low as assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence, it must be assumed that the quality of a dystrophin isoform lacking the amino acids encoded by exon 5 is compromised.",

These features are not quite as marked as those in mdx mouse diaphragm, in which dystrophin is undetectable apart from occasional revertant fibres.

However, the few reports of single in-frame exon deletions in the primary actin-binding domain indicate that such changes have variable consequences. Two brothers with a deletion of DMD exon 3, showed early onset dystrophy and loss of ambulation, but stabilised in early adulthood and did not have respiratory or cardiac insufficiency [29]. A Japanese male, diagnosed as autistic at age 3 years was subsequently found to have a DMD deletion of exon 4. He was reported to have mild pseudo-hypertrophy, modestly elevated CK, but with otherwise normal muscle strength [43, 44]. His three affected brothers were found to have similar severe mental retardation and also did not exhibit any muscle weakness. One can only speculate if the autism was related to the dystrophin isoform in this one family.",

Consequently, the simplest exon skipping strategy, that is, skipping exon 5 may not offer the best outcome for patients with intra-exonic mutations in this region of the gene. A deletion of DMD exons 3\u20139 is reported to be associated with a mild BMD phenotype [38], and further investigations on patients with other in-frame deletions in the DMD amino terminal region may help to define better functional dystrophin isoforms that could be induced by AO mediated exon selection.",
