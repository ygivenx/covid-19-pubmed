Pike et al. reported that 4,079 LAIs resulting in 168 deaths occurred in the United States from 1930 to 1978 [3, 4]. Thereafter, Harding and Byers identified 1,267 LAIs resulting in 22 deaths [5]. According to Siengsanan-Lamont et al., 27 LAIs occurred between 1982 and 2016 in the Asia-Pacific region [6]. In these instances, the LAIs were caused by Brucella spp., Chlamydia psittaci, Coccidioides immitis, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Blastomyces dermatitidis, dengue virus, hepatitis B virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. However, the causes in many cases of LAI have not been clearly identified in the past [7, 8].",

In 2004, two laboratory workers at the National Institute of Virology Laboratory of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, China) were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) due to the handling of the incompletely inactive virus [9]. It was thought that two individuals were the source of a subsequent small outbreak of SARS [9]. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) announced that approximately 80 staff members had been exposed to Bacillus anthracis when samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry after transferring incompletely inactivated samples from a biosafety level (BSL)-3 facility to a lower BSL facility [10]. In 2004, three researchers at Boston University developed tularemia after accidental exposure to F. tularensis supposedly due to their failure to comply with safety protocols [11]. Considering these accidental infections with SARS-CoV, B. anthracis and F. tularensis, laboratory workers should pay careful attention when handling pathogens. Therefore, it seems necessary to educate staff members about methods for complete inactivation of pathogens.",

To prevent accidental infections, samples prepared at BSL-3 facilities are required to be completely inactivated if the samples are handled in an outside facility with the same or lower BSL.",

If untreated with antibiotics, the mortality rate is extremely high at around 30%\u201360% [18\u201320]. F. tularensis subsp. holarctica and mediasiatica have intermediate virulence and low mortality rates [21], whereas infection with subsp. novicida has only been detected in immunocompromised humans [21, 22]. In Japan, all in vitro and in vivo bacteriological procedures involving F. tularensis, with the exception of subsp. holarctica live vaccine strain (LVS), subsp. tularensis B38 strain and subsp. novicida must be conducted in a BSL-3 facility.",

F. tularensis subsp. tularensis SCHU S4 dried on acrylic, glass, polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, silicone rubber, and stainless steel was easily inactivated by exposure to vaporous hydrogen peroxide [29]. While, F. tularensis SCHU S4 dried on wood would be inactivated hardly by bleach, citric acid, 70% ethanol, quaternary Ammonia, and Pine-Sol [30]. Bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with F. tularensis SCHU S4 was completely fixed with 4% PFA for 5 min and 2% PFA for 15 min, whereas treatment with 1% PFA for 24 h failed to inactive infected cells [31].

Hence, the relationships between ethanol concentration and the viability of F. tularensis SCHU P9 were investigated. Bacteria suspended in 0%\u201390% ethanol were incubated for 10 min at room temperature (23\u00b0C) and then centrifuged to discard the ethanol solution. Afterward, the CFU number of pellets was calculated. The preliminary data showed no significant change in CFU number from before centrifugation (Fig 3B). After treatment with >50% ethanol for 10 min, no viable bacteria were detected (Fig 3C). On the other hand, the CFU numbers after treatment with 0%, 10% and 30% ethanol for 10 min were 3.1 \u00d7 106, 1.6 \u00d7 106 and 1.2 \u00d7 104, respectively (Fig 3C). Furthermore, the incubation time required for inactivation with the use of various concentrations of ethanol was determined. Bacteria suspended in 90% and 70% ethanol were rapidly inactivated within 15 s (Fig 3D), whereas those in 0%\u201350% ethanol had survived for incubation periods for 60 s, although the CFU number was significantly decreased by treatment with 50% ethanol (p < 0.001).",

To inactivate complement, samples are generally incubated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. As is widely known, many viruses and non-sporulating bacteria are usually inactivated at 50\u00b0C\u201360\u00b0C, with the exception of enterococci [40, 41] and thermophilic bacteria. In this study, no bacteria were detected in CDM and undiluted FBS following heat treatment at 56\u00b0C from 10 to 30 min (S1 Fig. and Fig 2B). Moreover, bacterial suspensions in deionized water were quickly inactivated at 56\u00b0C within 1 min. Day et al. reported that the time required to reduce the population of F. tularensis LVS by 90% (D10-values) in liquid infant formula, apple juice, mango juice, and orange juice was between 8 and 16 s [42]. In this study, the D10-values for F. tularensis SCHU P9 in CDM, undiluted FBS, and PBS were 40, 40 and 35 s, respectively. Though the efficiency of the inactivation between our findings and previous data seemed to differ, Francisella viability after heat treatment was strongly affected by the solution composition. According to these data, heat treatment at 56\u00b0C for 30 min was sufficient to inactivate F. tularensis.",

The separation based on the pore size of the membrane using the filter membrane is a physical removal/separation mechanism and not chemical inactivation. F. tularensis with a diameter ranging 0.2\u20130.7 \u03bcm [43] might pass through the membrane filter having average pore sizes of 0.45 and 0.22 \u03bcm and can survive in the filter devices during filtration. In addition, the filter membrane can easily clog if the sample fluid contains abundant aggregated bacteria larger than the pore size of the filter. It is possible that even little pressure can accidentally uncouple the connection between the syringe and the filter. Therefore, the leaked bacteria after filtration and the splashed bacteria during filtration should be paid attention to when filtration methods are applied.",

UVC radiation can effectively induce mutations and death of bacterial as well as mammal cells [46]. In particular, UV light at 254 nm, which is near the maximum absorbance in DNA [47], can induce the accumulation of dimers between adjacent thymidine residues in the same DNA strand [33]. Rose et al. reported that F. tularensis LVS and NY98 suspended in distilled water were inactivated by UVC treatment at 4 mJ/cm2 [48]. We confirmed that F. tularensis SCHU P9 spread onto Eugon chocolate agar was completely inactivated by UV radiation at 6.3 mJ/cm2. In addition, bacteria suspended in deionized water and CDM into 1.5 mL tubes and 0.2 mL PCR tube were easily inactivated by UV radiation (Fig 6A). On the other hand, inactivation of bacterial suspensions in undiluted FBS was very difficult with UV radiation (Fig 6B), which suggested that UV radiation failed to inhibit bacteria in the solution containing abundant nutrients, including proteins. In Bacillus thuringiensis and B. anthracis spores, effective inactivation by UV radiation was also inhibited under more nutritive germination conditions [49]. It is probable that UV radiation is unable to inactivate bacteria because the solution containing abundant nutrients absorbs the UV light into its compounds [50\u201352].",

The Ohara Research Laboratory (Ohara General Hospital, Fukushima, Japan) obtained strain SCHU from the Rocky Mountain Laboratory of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Hamilton, MT, USA) in 1958 [55]. Afterward, F. tularensis SCHU was attenuated by 373 passages in artificial media over 30 years in Japan [55]. Virulent F. tularensis SCHU P9 was isolated by in vivo passages from attenuated SCHU, as described in a previous report [32]. We believe the methods for inactivation of F. tularensis SCHU P9 described in this study would be applicable to other strains of Francisella because the viabilities of the treated samples of F. tularensis SCHU P9 and the other five strains were similar (Fig 7).",

(C) Bacteria spiked into detergents (1% LDS buffer, 1% NP-40 and 1% TritonX-100) were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 day. (E-F) Bacteria suspended in deionized water (E), CDM (F), and undiluted FBS (G) were aliquoted into four 0.2 mL PCR tubes. These samples were simultaneously radiated with UV light. All treated samples were compared with the control samples. All experiments were performed in four replicates. The mean CFU \u00b1 SD are shown.",
