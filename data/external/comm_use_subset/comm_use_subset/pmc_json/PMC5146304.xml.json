As the disease progresses quickly and is lethal, diagnosis and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible [2].",

            "text": "Hepcidin is a low molecular weight, antimicrobial peptide hormone and was first discovered in human urine [3]. It is produced by the liver as a first-line response to inflammatory reactions and high Fe concentrations [4,5]. Hepcidin plays a fundamental role in the regulation of Fe metabolism [6], which is a part of foundational cellular functions and thus of vital importance. On the other hand, by participating in redox reactions leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), Fe also causes oxidative stress. Therefore, Fe has been regarded as a potentially toxic element to cells [7]. Fe also plays an important role in pathogenesis of bacterial infections as bacteria utilize Fe for survival, growth and proliferation; therefore, it is of paramount importance to control the Fe metabolism [6]. It is well known that the abundance of Fe suppresses defense system leading host vulnerable to infections. There is a significant relationship between Hepcidin, Fe metabolism, inflammation, and the immune system. The fact that hepcidin plays an active role in the regulation of Fe release from macrophages and in the control of excessive Fe absorption from the duodenum is well documented [6]. Hepcidin is a part of the natural defense mechanism, thus it limits the amount of Fe that can be utilized by pathogens [8]. In inflammatory conditions, hypoferremia is an important first-line protective mechanism in response to infections [9]. Fe also participates in redox reactions, causing the production of ROS, and thus leading to oxidative stress [7]. Free radicals play a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases [10]. Newborns are subject to oxidative stress during birth. It is also reported that in livestock diseases, especially enteritis and pneumonia, antioxidant capacity is efficacious [11].",

The animals were given standard treatment (antibiotic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin C, fluid therapy, and intestinal astringent). For determination of serum hepcidin, TAS, TOS, Fe levels, and hematological parameters; blood samples were taken before and after treatment in all cases. 8.5 mL of blood was taken from the jugular vein of each animal into coagulant tubes for biochemical analysis, and 3 mL blood was taken into ETDA tubes for hematological analysis. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the serum was harvested and kept at \u221220\u00b0C until the analysis. Serum hepcidin (Mybiosource\u00ae), TAS (Rel Assay Diagnostics\u00ae), and TOS (Rel Assay Diagnostics\u00ae) were determined using commercial ELISA kits, and Fe value was measured spectrophotometrically. Hematological (WBC, lymphocyte [LYM], red blood cells [RBC], mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hematocrit [HCT]) analysis was performed on blood counter (VG-MS4e\u00ae, Melet Schloes\u0131ng, France).",

            "text": "Serum hepcidin levels in calves with suspected septicemia were significantly high before treatment when compared to after treatment; also Fe levels were lower before treatment when compared to after treatment in this study. This situation could be related to the interaction between hepcidin and Fe and also gives credence to the role of hepcidin in the hemostasis of Fe during inflammation and infection. As in our study, Fe levels are well known to decrease in diarrheic calves when compared to healthy calves [20,21]. Although no study exists reporting hepcidin concentration in diseased calves, studies in human subjects show that cord blood hepcidin levels might be an important indicator in diagnosing early-onset of neonatal sepsis. The cord blood hepcidin levels of neonatal infants with sepsis varied between 118.1 and 8400 ng/mL and were significantly higher than the healthy infants [22]. A similar result was reported that hepcidin concentrations in neonatal infants with sepsis were significantly higher than in healthy infants [23]. These findings along with our results add credence to the idea that hepcidin-Fe interaction may play a role in the pathogenesis of septicemia.",

Any event breaking up this balance in favor of the oxidative stress molecules will cause cell damage [27,28]. The host cells initiate the antioxidant system in case of exposure to oxidative stress [27]. Kabu et al. [16] reported TOS and TAS values in neonatal calves with diarrhea as 13.47\u00b10.81 \u00b5mol H2O2/L and 0.51\u00b10.02 mmol Trolox-equivalent/L, respectively, and treatment of these calves caused changes in these values of 11.21\u00b10.26 \u00b5mol H2O2/L and 0.55\u00b10.02 mmol Trolox-equivalent/L, respectively. Studies also reported that parameters used for oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) were higher [29] and antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase [21], TAS) were lower in diarrheic calves [29]. Similarly, in our study, TAS level was significantly lower and TOS level was significantly higher in diarrheic calves before treatment, and treatment caused corrections in these parameters. Decrease in TAS and increase in TOS levels demonstrated that oxidative stress was evident in the diseased calves in our study. Increased TOS and hepcidin levels before treatment are thought that associated with inflammation. After treatment increased TAS and decreased hepcidin levels support this opinion.",
