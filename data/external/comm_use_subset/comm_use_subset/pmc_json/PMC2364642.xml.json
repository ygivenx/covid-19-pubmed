JV is a type I genogroup III (GIII) norovirus which is closely related to the type II GIII bovine noroviruses Newbury agent 2 and Dumfries [3], [4]. The GIII noroviruses are responsible for causing enteric disease in cattle [2], [5] and, thus, likely share a similar tissue tropism to the human-associated enteric noroviruses. Like human noroviruses [6] bovine noroviruses have a high seroprevalence [4]. JV is therefore a potentially useful model for studying the molecular biology of enteric norovirus pathogenesis and replication.",

            "text": "The 7.3 kb polyadenylated RNA genome of JV has been characterised previously [7] and, like other noroviruses, is organised into 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the non-structural proteins in the form of a large 185 kDa polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved into functional replication proteins by the viral encoded 3C-like protease. ORF2 encodes the structural capsid protein (56 kDa) and ORF3 encodes a small basic protein, which has been shown to function as a minor capsid component [8]. JV ORF1 is consistent with other caliciviruses in that it encodes a 39 kDa 2C-like nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase), a 3C-like protease and a 56 kDa 3D-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [7], [9]\u2013[13]. However, the genomic sequence within the 5\u2032 region of JV ORF1 (5\u2032GS) displays a high level of divergence. This divergence is mainly attributed to the presence of several proline-encoding polypyrimidine tracts within the region predicted to encode a 35 kDa N-terminal protein [7]. The predicted size of N-terminal proteins relative to the size of the respective 2C proteins differs within the norovirus genus. Within the GI noroviruses, such as Southampton virus, the N-terminal protein (44.8 kDa) is larger in size compared to the 2C protein (39.6 kDa). This is in contrast to the GII noroviruses, such as Lordsdale virus and Camberwell virus, in that the N-terminal protein is smaller in size compared to the 2C protein [11], [14]. This is also the case for Jena virus in which the predicted JV N-terminal protein (35 kDa) is smaller than the JV 2C protein (39 kDa) [7].",

Alignment of the N-term protein sequences of various noroviruses indicates little similarity between genogroups within the first 180 residues, however towards the C-terminal end of the protein similarity between the amino acid residues increases. Recent studies investigating the functions of the Norwalk virus N-terminal protein have successfully demonstrated association with the Golgi apparatus in transfected cells [15]. In addition this study also identified a picornaviral 2B like region within the N-terminal protein, suggesting that the protein is involved with host cell membrane interactions, reinforcing other findings that have suggested that the Norwalk virus N-terminal protein disrupts intracellular protein trafficking, including proteins destined for the host cell membrane [16]. A 3C protease-mediated cleavage event within the N-terminal protein (37 kDa) was described for Camberwell virus, a genogroup 2 norovirus, yielding proteins of 22 kDa and 15 kDa [17]. Based on these observations and location within the genome it was hypothesised that the N-terminal protein of noroviruses corresponds to the 2AB region in picornaviruses.",

It was subsequently demonstrated that elements within the 5\u2032 end of Norwalk virus bind specifically with cellular proteins such as La, PTB and PCBP2 [19] which have all been implicated in IRES-mediated cap-independent translation in the closely related picornaviruses [20]\u2013[23].

The lack of an N-terminal protein encoded by the JV 5\u2032GS, predicted to be 35.3 kDa, is unique among the noroviruses that have been studied in this way. The in vitro transcription and translation profile for JV was therefore studied in more detail.

            "text": "As it was clear that the JV 5\u2032GS did not posses any IRES-like functions it was necessary to determine the location of translation initiation within ORF1. This was predicted be the ATG encoding methionine at nucleotide position 22, as it is situated in a favourable context for translation initiation [7]. To investigate this multiple translation termination codons (polySTOP) were inserted into the JV genome within the 3B-encoding region, downstream of the 5\u2032GS, to halt translation at a defined point. In vitro transcription and translation of this construct would, in theory, yield a product whose size would relate to the initiation codon used within the 5\u2032GS (Figure 3). To address the unlikely event of translation read-through or re-initiation downstream of the polySTOP, which would result in subsequent translation of the 3C protease and cleavage of the truncated ORF1 polyprotein, a mutation was made within the active site encoding region of the 3C protease within JV ORF1, to prevent any viral mediated cleavage of ORF1 translation products (JV 3Cmut/polySTOP). A point mutation of the critical cysteine residue within the highly conserved GDCG motif to a glycine residue was performed, and this approach has been described for the successful inactivation of other norovirus' 3C activity [28]. In vitro transcription and translation analysis was performed on JV wild type (Figure 4, lane 2), JV 3Cmut (Figure 4, lane 3) and JV 3Cmut/polySTOP (Figure 4, lane 4). The mutation of the critical cysteine residue within the 3C region of JV successfully inactivated the 3C protease, thus a large, >200kDa uncleaved polyprotein is yielded following TNT\u00ae. The major product generated by JV 3Cmut/polySTOP was calculated to be 103kDa in size. Based on computer predictions this is in agreement with the initiation of translation occurring at nucleotide 22, which demonstrates that the JV N-term protein is translated in full in vitro. At this time it is not possible to determine whether translation of intracellular VPg-bound viral RNA initiates at nucleotide 22, although it is likely given the favourable context in which the initiation codon is situated.",

The appearance, therefore, of a previously unseen 42 kDa protein in the in vitro transcription and translation profile was unexpected but this protein does represent a translation product for the JV 5\u2032GS. To date, it has not been possible to explain the difference in the predicted and observed sizes for the JV N-term, and the addition of the 14 amino acid V5 epitope within JV N-term does not account for this apparent large shift in molecular weight. However, a recent study described a similar anomaly when investigating proteolytic processing in the murine norovirus MNV-1 [12]. The predicted molecular weight for the MNV-1 N-term protein was 38.3 kDa. The authors successfully generated antisera against the MNV-1 N-term and used it to immunoprecipitate the protein from in vitro transcription and translation reactions and observed that the N-term existed as a 45 kDa doublet, in addition to the predicted size of 38 kDa. However, when MNV-1 N-term antisera was used to probe MNV-1-infected cell lysates only the 43\u201345 kDa doublet and a large 115 kDa precursor could be detected, suggesting that the predicted 38 kDa form of the N-term is not generated in cell culture. Again, it was not possible to conclusively determine the cause of this discrepancy, but it was speculated that the N-term protein may migrate abnormally in SDS-PAGE, or may be proteolytically processed at a previously unknown cleavage site downstream of the protein's predicted C-terminus. It is also possible that the N-term protein might be modified in some way leading to a shift in observed molecular weight. At this time the same conclusions would seem appropriate for the JV N-term. In addition, it is not known why the JV N-term was previously not detected in in vitro transcription and translation studies prior to the insertion of the V5 epitope. It cannot be ruled out, however, that the wild type JV N-term aberrantly co-migrates with the 39 kDa JV 2C protein in SDS-PAGE. Indeed, the appearance of the V5/N-term product from transfected cell lysates would appear to be one of a doublet (Figure 8), also analogous to the observed appearance of the MNV N-term protein in infected cells, suggesting the likelihood of a further cleavage site within the JV N-term protein which has yet to be elucidated. Nevertheless, these studies clearly demonstrate that a protein representative of the 5\u2032GS of JV is translated both in vitro and in vivo and is proteolytically processed from the ORF1 polyprotein following translation initiation at nucleotide 22.",

The lacZ coding sequence was amplified from the pSV-\u03b2-Gal reporter vector (Promega) using Bio-X-Act DNA polymerase and the primers lacZ F (5\u2032-AACTGCAAGCTT\nGATATGGGGGATCCCGTCGTTTTACAACG-3\u2032), containing the HindIII restriction site (bold) and a kozak translation initiation site (underlined), and lacZ R (5\u2032-AACTGCGGGCCC\nTTATTATTTTTGACACCAGACCA-3\u2032) containing the ApaI restriction site (bold) and translation termination codons (underlined). The lacZ amplicon was ligated to the pEGFP-C1/JV 5\u2032 GS vector following restriction enzyme digest of both amplicon and vector with HindIII and ApaI restriction enzymes, and the ligated DNA used to transform E.coli Top10. The construct was verified by sequencing. Construction of pEGFP-C1/IRES/lacZ was as follows; The EMCV IRES sequence was amplified from the pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) using Bio-X-Act DNA polymerase and the primers IRES Bgl F (5\u2032-ACTCGAAGATCT\nTAATAGAGCTTCGAATTCTGCAGTCGA-3\u2032), containing the BglII restriction site (bold) and translation termination codons (underlined) to prevent carry over translation as before, and IRES Sac R (5\u2032- ACTCGAGAGCTCTGTGGCCATATTATCATCGTG-3\u2032), containing the SacI restriction site (bold). The IRES amplicon was ligated to the pEGFP-C1 vector follwing restriction enzyme digest of both amplicon and vector with BgIII and SacI restriction enzymes, and the ligated DNA used to transform E.coli Top10. The lacZ amplicon described previously was ligated to the intermediate pEGFP-C1/IRES vector following restriction enzyme digest of both amplicon and vector with HindIII and ApaI restriction enzymes, and the ligated DNA used to transform E.coli Top10.",

Three rounds of amplification using the JV full length cDNA clone as template were used to generate the final mutant protease cassette. Round 1 used the primers JV F1 (5\u2032-CGTCTCAGGGTTGATACT-3\u2032) and JV Mut 1 (5\u2032-GCAACCACCGTCACCAG-3\u2032), yielding a 222 bp amplicon (point mutation nucleotide shown in bold).

Amplicons generated in rounds 1 and 2 were pooled to serve as template for round 3 using the primers JV NF (5\u2032-ATGTCAACCACCACCAGC \u20133\u2032) and JV NR (5\u2032-AAGGGCTCCGGTGAAGG-3\u2032). This cassette contained two BclI restriction sites flanking the 3Cprotease active site, as also found in the wild-type full length clone. Restriction digest using BclI was used to remove the appropriate wild-type cassette from the JV full length clone. The mutant cassette was also digested with BclI prior to ligation to the BclI-digested JV full length clone. The ligated DNA was used to transform E.coli Top10, and was designated JV 3Cmut.",
