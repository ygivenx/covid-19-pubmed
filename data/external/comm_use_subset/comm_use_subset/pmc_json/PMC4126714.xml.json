Initially identified over 30 years ago [2], and named 9\u201327 (IFITM1), 1-8D (IFITM2) and 1-8U (IFITM3) [3], these proteins received little attention until human IFITM3 depletion was found to enhance IAV infection in cell culture assays. Conversely, over-expression of IFITM3, or the closely related IFITM1 and IFITM2, could inhibit IAV replication [1]. Studies in mice and humans have suggested that IFITM3, at least, also protects against IAV infection in vivo\n[4], [5]. However, the IFITM proteins are not IAV-specific and, in cell culture at least, have broad-spectrum antiviral activity [6], though in some systems they may enhance cellular infection of human coronavirus OC43 [7] and human papillomavirus 16 [8].",

Furthermore, this activity was dependent on localisation of IFITM3 to endosomes [10]. More recent studies suggested that IFITM over-expression may increase membrane rigidity and positive curvature, preventing the early events in membrane fusion [11]. Alternatively, IFITM protein interaction with vesicle membrane protein associated protein A (VAPA), disrupts cholesterol homeostasis and may increase membrane rigidity [12]. However, more recent work has questioned the role of cholesterol [13], [14]. Thus, the precise molecular mechanism(s) for IFITM inhibition of viral entry remains to be established.",

Indeed, sequence analyses identified two hydrophobic, putative membrane interacting domains in each of the proteins. Additional studies demonstrated palmitoylation of cysteine residues adjacent to the hydrophobic domains, a post-translational modification indicative of membrane proteins [16]. However, the membrane topology of the IFITM proteins has remained ambiguous. Initially, they were suggested to be dual pass, transmembrane proteins with both N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) exposed extracellularly and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL) (Fig. 1, model 1). This model was based on the ability of antibodies against unknown IFITM1 external epitopes to aggregate leukaemia cells [15], [17], immunoprecipitation of extracellular radiolabelled IFITM1 [18] and the accessibility of IFITM3 NTD and CTD epitope tags at the cell surface by FACS and immunofluorescence assays, respectively [1].",

We used two commercially available antibodies against the hu IFITM1 and IFITM3 NTDs.

This domain has 69% and 75% amino acid identity with hu IFITM2 and IFITM3, respectively. The IFITM3 NTD antibody (anti-IFITM3-NTD) was raised against a peptide with a sequence corresponding to the first 30 amino acids of hu IFITM3. Hu IFITM1 has an N-terminal 21 amino acid truncation compared to IFITM3, so contains only 9 amino acids overlapping with this domain. However, there is 90% amino acid identity between the first 30 amino acids of hu IFITM3 and IFITM2.",

In samples from trypsin-treated cells the higher molecular weight band was rapidly lost, with a concomitant increase in the intensity of the lower band (Fig. 5Bi). This suggested that the higher molecular weight band is IFITM1-HA (confirmed in an anti-HA and anti-IFITM1-NTD overlay analysis [Fig. 5Biii]), and that the lower band is a cleavage product that has lost the HA-tag. We noted that about 8% (relative to untreated samples) of the HA-tagged protein was not digested by trypsin, even after long periods, suggesting that a small pool of IFITM1-HA protein was inaccessible to the protease (see below).",

IFITM1-HA expressing cells acted as a positive control and showed strong cell surface labelling (Fig. 8B). By contrast, most IFITM2-HA and IFITM3-HA cells showed little, if any, labelling. However, approximately 25% of IFITM3-HA cells and 10% of IFITM2-HA cells (calculated from 30 random fields of view at 40X magnification) showed intracellular, punctate labelling (Fig. 8D and E). Since the cells were labelled prior to fixation, this intracellular labelling suggested that, in some cells, the IFITM2-HA and IFITM3-HA proteins are trafficked to the cell surface where an externally exposed HA epitope could bind antibody, prior to internalisation into intracellular organelles. The lack of labelling in the majority of cells, which express the IFITM proteins, indicates the labelling is not due to non-specific fluid phase uptake of antibody.

The NTD contains two potential trypsin cleavage sites, but we saw no evidence of these sites being accessible to exogenous trypsin. Thus our results are consistent with a model recently proposed for murine and human IFITM3 indicating a cytoplasmic NTD and CIL domain, connected by an intramembrane hydrophobic domain (M1) that does not fully span the membrane, and a second transmembrane domain (M2) linking the CIL domain to an extracellular CTD [21], [22]. Our results with antibody labelling experiments indicate that hu IFITM2 and 3 are likely to have the same topology, suggesting this may be a common feature of human interferon-induced IFITM proteins, and mu IFITM3. However, this model is not consistent with published data on mu IFITM1 [20], in which palmitoylation of a CTD cysteine (mu IFITM1 C103) suggested a cytoplasmic location. This cysteine is not conserved in hu IFITM1, perhaps indicating why there is an apparent difference between hu and mu IFITM1 [20]. Whether palmitoylation of mu IFITM1 or other non-human IFITM proteins influence protein topology and/or its cellular distribution, as well as any possible effects on functional activities, remains to be examined.",

If these tags are at the C-terminus they will reside in extracellular and lumenal spaces where they may be exposed to proteolytic conditions. Indeed, our results suggest that, even under normal culture conditions, IFITM-HA expressing cells have cleavage products resulting from the loss of the HA-tag or residues from the CTD itself. Western blots of A549 cells stably expressing IFITM1 show two bands when using the anti-IFITM1-NTD antibody. The higher molecular weight band is the HA-tagged form of the protein, while the lower weight band is a cleaved form of the protein that has lost the HA-tag, and possibly other residues from the CTD. Since this band is seen in cells that were not treated with trypsin, we suggest that this C-terminal cleavage may occur in the endosomal system. This conclusion is supported by the observation that in A549 cells expressing HA-tagged IFITM2 or 3, intracellular organelles can be seen that contain IFITM2 or 3 with intact NTD epitopes but lacking the CTD HA-tag (Fig. 9).",

To date, published work has found that functionally important residues are located within the NTD [27] and the conserved CD225 domain [19], [29], comprising the membrane interacting domains and the CIL loop, as well as the second membrane domain that is proposed to interact with VAPA [12]. Our data suggest the first membrane domain enters into, but does not span, the lipid bilayers, perhaps allowing the protein to induce membrane curvature. It could be further speculated that an extracellular CTD may allow IFITM proteins to interact with key membrane components that are inaccessible on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane.",
