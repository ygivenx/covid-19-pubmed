Potential independent variables are age, sex, family size, registration status, frequency of travel outside the study area and whether or not they live in a rural area (Huangshan) or are migrant workers (Shenzhen). For students, age was categorised by type of school, whereas for employees we used 10-year age bands, with those below 20 and those over 60 merged. Family size was classified into small (< = 3) and large (>3) families. To decide which variables and interactions to include into the final model, we fitted models with all possible variable combinations, and up to two interaction terms, as well as all possible combinations of interaction terms for all combinations of up to 4 variables. The model with the lowest value of the Bayesian information criterion \n[9], where k is the number of parameters in the model and N is the number of observations, was selected as final model. The data were then further stratified by the variables identified in the linear regression, and the remaining variability of commuting distances within each stratum was characterised by fitting a functional form to the distance distributions separately for each stratum with at least 5 individuals.",

The dormitories provide very crowded accommodation with typically 8\u201312 people sleeping in the same room and many more assemble in the communal areas for eating and other pursuits [14]. While these dormitories are a potential focus of disease spread, the commuting distances (up to 7 km) for the migrant workers are the shortest observed in all datasets. We would therefore not expect this population to play a major role in the spatial spread of acute disease (such as influenza) themselves, but only via contact to other parts of the population who have longer commuting distances. However, if the migrants travel to their home provinces on a seasonal basis (which was not detected in this survey), they might indeed play a larger role in the long distance spread of chronic infectious diseases such as HIV or TB.",

Certainly we find in Shenzhen that those with residency permits have larger commuting distances, whereas the shortest distances are found in the Shenzhen migrant worker population. In Huangshan, commuting distances tend to be larger in the rural area. The dependence of commuting distance on age, with shorter distances for older people, is interesting and could be explained by a number of mechanisms. For instance, it is possible that over long timescales people change jobs or move if a more convenient opportunity arises, and that in this process the commuting distances tend to settle down to a more local distribution. It is also conceivable that over time there has been a shift in attitudes with younger people being more accepting of longer commuting distances.",

As people travelling long distances on a regular basis would be expected to contribute most to the spatial spread, the tail of the distance distribution has most impact on the potential spread of diseases. The distributions of commuting distances for both Shenzhen and Huangshan are considerably more local than those from western counties (UK, US [17], [18], see Figure 8), where power laws or exponential distributions have been used to model distance distributions [4], [8], [10], [19]. There are however massive differences between the two Chinese cities with the distance distribution for Huangshan city being very local, with no one in our datasets commuting further than 30 km, whereas the distribution found in Shenzhen is comparable to, albeit a little more local than that from Thailand [6]. Possible reasons for these differences include a weaker infrastructure or affordability of travelling.
