            "text": "To mediate colonization of host and/or environmental habitats, Gram-negative bacteria encode a highly conserved family of adhesive pili called chaperone-usher pathway (CUP) pili. Notably, CUP pili are critical virulence factors in a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, Salmonella and Yersiniae genera (Nuccio and B\u00e4umler, 2007). To date, 38 distinct CUP pilus types have been identified in Escherichia and Shigella genomes and plasmids, each of which is hypothesized to promote bacterial colonization of a distinct habitat (Nuccio and B\u00e4umler, 2007; Wurpel et al., 2013). Interestingly, single Escherichia coli genomes carry up to 16 distinct CUP operons, suggesting that the retention of an assortment of CUP pilus types by a single strain may be necessary to accommodate the complex lifecycle of E. coli (Wurpel et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Arguably, the best-studied CUP pili are those encoded by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), which is the causative agent of the majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect 150 million people annually worldwide and are associated with significant morbidity and economic impact (Foxman, 2014). UTI treatment failure is common, with ~25% of woman suffering from recurrent UTI (rUTI), and is due, in part, to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant UPEC strains (Scholes et al., 2000; Zowawi et al., 2015). UPEC that infect the urinary tract often originate from the host gastrointestinal tract. After being shed from the gut in the feces, UPEC can colonize peri-urethral or vaginal areas and subsequently ascend through the urethra to the bladder and/or kidneys, instigating UTI. In mice, type 1 pili, which promote binding to mannosylated proteins, play critical roles in both the gut and urinary tract. Recent work has revealed that type 1 pili help mediate UPEC intestinal colonization, thus promoting the establishment and/or maintenance of the UPEC reservoir in the gut that can eventually seed UTI (Spaulding et al., 2017). Upon entering the bladder, type 1 pili facilitate bacterial colonization and subsequent invasion into epithelial cells lining the bladder lumen (Mulvey et al., 1998; Martinez et al., 2000). Bladder invasion is a critical step in UPEC pathogenesis, allowing the bacteria to replicate in a niche protected from innate immune defense mechanisms, antibiotics, and expulsion during urination. UPEC that cannot invade the urothelium, like those lacking type 1 pili or its associated adhesin, FimH, are quickly cleared from the bladder, emphasizing the importance of type 1 pili mediated host-pathogen interactions on the fitness of UPEC during cystitis (Wright et al., 2005). After invading into a bladder cell, UPEC escape into the host cell cytoplasm and replicate to form biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) (Anderson et al., 2003; Justice et al., 2004) comprised of ~104 cells (Wright et al., 2007). Mouse models of UTI have revealed that while some mice are capable of self-resolving acute UPEC infection, others progress to chronic cystitis, which is characterized by persistent high titer bacteriuria (>104 CFU/ml) and high bacterial bladder burdens (>104 CFU) two or more weeks after inoculation (Hannan et al., 2010). In the absence of antibiotic treatment, chronic cystitis can also be observed in women (Mabeck, 1972; Ferry et al., 2004).",

While UPEC strains tend to be genetically heterogeneous the majority of UPEC strains isolated from women with UTI in the USA reside in the B2 clade (Schreiber et al., 2017). While the types of CUP pilus operons encoded in E. coli genomes varies between different clades and individual strains, the vast majority of sequenced E. coli strains, including nearly all sequenced UPEC clinical isolates, carry an intact copy of the type 1 pilus (Wurpel et al., 2013; Schreiber et al., 2017). Type 1 pili are encoded by the fim operon which, like the gene clusters encoding other CUP pili, encodes all the dedicated proteins necessary to assemble a mature pilus onto the bacterial surface, including: an outer-membrane pore-forming usher protein, a periplasmic chaperone protein, pilus subunits, and the tip adhesin protein. Most pilus tip adhesins, including the FimH adhesin, are made up of two domains, an N-terminal lectin domain, which is responsible for recognition and attachment to a ligand(s), and a C-terminal pilin domain, which connects the adhesin to the bulk of the pilus (Jones et al., 1992). Pilus subunits, including the pilin domain of the adhesin, are comprised of an incomplete immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold, which lacks the C-terminal \u03b2-strand and require the action of the dedicated periplasmic chaperone for proper folding (Sauer et al., 2002). In a process known as donor strand complementation (DSC), a periplasmic chaperone templates subunit folding by transiently providing one of its \u03b2-strands (Sauer et al., 1999). Chaperone-subunit complexes are then delivered to the outer membrane usher, which catalyzes pilus assembly via a reaction known as donor strand exchange (DSE). In DSE, the strand donated to a nascent subunit by the chaperone is replaced by the N-terminal extension (Nte) of an incoming subunit (Sauer et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Following this pattern, the type 1 pilus usher (FimD) and chaperone (FimC) help type 1 pili assemble into a composite pilus structure consisting of a short tip fibrillum made up of the adhesin protein (FimH) and two minor subunits (FimG and FimF) that is joined to the pilus rod, a homopolymer of ~1000 FimA subunits. Once extruded to the extracellular surface, the type 1 pilus coils into a rigid right-handed helical structure that is capable of unwinding into a flexible linear fiber (Abraham et al., 1992; Jones et al., 1995; Saulino et al., 2000; Aprikian et al., 2011). This ability to transition between a coiled, helical rod and a linear fiber has been proposed to allow the type 1 pilus to act as a \u2018molecular spring\u2019 to maintain adherence in the face of fluid shear forces (Zakrisson et al., 2012). Specifically, we hypothesize that in the absence of urine voiding, the type 1 pilus rod is maintained in the coiled helical state that permits subsequent contact and invasion into bound epithelial cells. However, upon encountering the shear forces associated with micturition, the pilus extends to the linear form, absorbing the shear force and thus preventing the expulsion of the bacteria from the bladder.",

Residues involved in critical FimA-FimA interactions were identified that when mutated reduced the force required to unwind the helix, despite not altering the ability of the FimA protein to be incorporated into the pilus rod. When introduced into the chromosome of UTI89, a human UPEC clinical cystitis isolate, these point mutations dramatically reduced the ability of UTI89 to establish an intestinal reservoir and cause acute and chronic cystitis. In contrast, these point mutant strains did not result in large scale differences in levels of piliation or ability to agglutinate mannose-expressing guinea pig red blood cells in vitro. Taken together our results show that the identity of residues within the FimA rod, are critical for the type 1 pili mediated virulence of UPEC in the urinary tract and suggest that the helical pilus rod has an important functional role, beyond serving as a platform to present FimH, in promoting colonization in the gut and infection of the bladder.",

Sequencing the fimA PCR product showed that the encoded amino acid sequence was identical to the FimA protein from BW25113 (GenBank AIN34588.1) and MG1655 (GenBank NP_418734.1). There was no possibility of cross-contamination of the FimA and T4P filament images, as each has a very different helical symmetry.

There were no ambiguities in threading the known FimA sequence through the density map (Supplementary file 1), even though the electron density observed on the outside of the rod is less well defined (Figure 1B). As a result, the first two residues and the last residue of FimA, which are located close to each other on the outside of the rod, are not resolved in the density map. The 4.2 \u00c5 estimate of the resolution is consistent with the well-separated \u03b2-strands and the density present for certain bulky side chains in the central lumen (Figure 1C\u2013E). Further, in the structure we observe the N-terminal donor strand of one subunit completing the \u03b2-sheet of the adjacent subunit. Overall, the type 1 pilus is a 70 \u00c5 diameter rod where each adjacent subunit rotates around the helical axis by 115\u00b0 and translates along the axis by 7.7 \u00c5 (Figure 2A). If we label each subunit along the 1-start helix by N, a subunit N0 interacts with six adjacent subunits (N-1,N-2,N-3,N+1,N+2,N+3) (Figure 2A,B). The donor strand complementation involves mostly hydrophobic interactions. Most prominently, the hydrophobic amino acids Val5, Val10 and Phe12 in the N-terminal \u03b2-strand (Nte) of one subunit are inserted into the next subunit\u2019s hydrophobic groove created by a missing \u03b2-strand (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1).",

Here, we found that many of the FimA sequences were comprised of 159 residues, including BW25113, while other FimA sequences, such as the one from UTI89, a prototypical UPEC isolate, contained an additional two amino acid residues at the N-terminus of the mature protein (Figure 3A). Global alignment revealed a consensus sequence of 161 residues where half of the FimA residues in the mature protein are invariant (79/161 residues) and that 83.9% are highly conserved (139/161 residues with >95% sequence identity) (Figure 3A). We found the FimA sequences to be significantly more variable than other parts of the type 1 pilus machinery. For example, the mature forms of the FimC chaperone and FimH adhesin (n = 1,760 and n = 1,943, respectively; Supplementary file 4) obtained from the same database contain 97.6% and 97.5% highly conserved residues, respectively, as compared to 83.9% in FimA. In general, most E. coli genes evolve slowly (Lee et al., 2012), so the degree of divergence between alleles of FimA is abnormally high. This suggests that the selection forces acting on the FimA protein are different from the forces acting on the rest of the fim operon. Interestingly, the non-conserved residues within the FimA sequences are all located on the exterior surface of the solved cryo-EM model (Figure 3B), which is likely indicative of immune pressures selecting for antigenic diversification (Wildschutte et al., 2004). In particular, the first few amino acids of the N-terminus of the mature protein, disordered in our reconstruction, have some of the highest variability throughout the entire protein, suggesting that these amino acids do not play a functional role in the dynamics of unwinding in the type one pilus rod. In contrast, almost every residue involved in subunit-subunit interactions in the rod is either highly conserved or invariant (Figure 3B,C). This includes every residue lining the lumen (Figure 3C). The conservation of residues lining the lumen might be due to the transport of some product through this opening that is ~15 \u00c5 across (the height of the triangular lumen that rotates as one travels along the pilus). More likely, however, every residue in the lumen is either involved in making a subunit-subunit contact (including the DSE contacts with the Nte from an adjacent subunit) or packed tightly between residues that are making such contacts.",

In addition, to assess whether FimA mutants altered the type-1 mediated ability of UPEC to infect the bladder and colonize the gut, we made mutations in the chromosomal fimA gene of UTI89. Thus, we do note that FimAUTI89 differs from our cryo-EM rod FimABW25113 sequence in 16 residues, with all of the differences lying within highly variable residues located on the exterior of the pilus rod, including two additional amino acids at the N-terminus. These two additional N-terminal residues in UTI89 generate a shift in the numbering of UTI89 residues compared to FimABW25113 (e.g., A22R in BW25113 corresponds to A24R in UTI89). To avoid confusion herein all residues are discussed using the BW25113 numbering system.",

            "text": "To evaluate the evolutionary pressures shaping FimA and thus the type one pilus rod, we obtained gene sequences encoding the 1,828 FimA proteins from the Ensemble database to measure the selection pressures acting on the gene. After removing incomplete and duplicate sequences from the analysis, we were able to compare a total of 191 unique fimA sequences (Supplementary file 3), which were then trimmed to remove the signal sequence. These sequences encoding the mature protein were examined for evidence of recombination, which can result from horizontal transfer of genetic sequences between distinct strains and confound evolutionary analyses that assume all sequences were vertically inherited (Anisimova et al., 2003). Phylogenetic trees were thus corrected for use in subsequent analyses (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006). We then assessed the ratio of the rates of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous nucleotide mutations (dS) in each codon in the alignment (dN/dS) to estimate the selection pressures acting on each residue in the FimA protein using a fixed-effects likelihood measurement algorithm (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005). In general, a dN/dS ratio >1 is indicative of selection pressure favoring change in amino acid identity at the position (i.e., adaptive or positive selection) while a dN/dS ratio <1 indicates conservation at the codon (i.e., purifying selection or negative selection). Here, we found that 66 codons were under purifying selection, five codons were under adaptive selection, and an additional 27 codons were too conserved to be included in analysis (Supplementary file 5). The remaining 63 codons showed no evidence of statistically significant selection in either direction. All of the positively selected sites, N64, A109, T117, S120 and F138, encode residues located on the exterior surface of the FimA rod and away from any subunit-subunit interface (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). The 66 codons under purifying selection combined with the 27 codons too conserved for analysis encode many of the highly conserved residues found throughout subunit-subunit interfaces with the subunits above, below, and alongside (Figure 3B,C). This strongly suggests that evolutionary pressures are working to conserve the identity of residues that interact within the helical rod, while diversifying amino acid residues that are exposed to the host and susceptible to immune recognition.",

This dataset included 21 distinct UPEC strains isolated from a cohort of women with frequent, recurrent UTI and 46 reference E. coli strains that included lab and commensal strains, as well as a variety of intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogens (Schreiber et al., 2017)(Supplementary file 6). The fimA gene was carried by the majority of E. coli strains analyzed (57/67); including nearly every UPEC strain (96.3% or 26/27 strains). Importantly, the fimA sequences from UPEC strains were spread through the phylogenetic tree, indicating that there was not a single variant of FimA found in all UPEC strains (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). To determine if these different variants were under different selection pressure, we measured the dN/dS ratio of each branch in this fimA phylogeny to see if there were branches that were under different selection pressures than the rest of the branches in the phylogeny (i.e., the \u2018background\u2019 rate of selection)(Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011). Here, we identified three branches with statistically significant evidence of episodic diversifying selection, including two branches carrying most of the clinical UPEC strains (branches labeled A and B) as well as enterohemorrhagic and enterotoxigenic E. coli strains in the branch labeled C (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). This pattern of evolution is indicative of strong adaptive selection acting on some, but not all, branches in a phylogeny. Taken together, we find that fimA is much more diverse than other parts of the type 1 machinery, owing to high rates of nucleotide polymorphisms and genetic recombination, and that fimA has undergone repeated rounds of strong selective pressures that have conserved residues responsible for subunit-subunit interfaces while varying the external surface of the protein that is exposed to the host milieu.",

We expressed these variant fimA genes in trans in UTI89-LON\u2206fimA, a strain with a chromosomal deletion of the fimA gene in a UTI89 strain where the phase-variable fimS promoter is locked in the ON orientation (LON) by altering the left inverted repeat necessary for promoter inversion (Kostakioti et al., 2012).

Most of our fimA mutants showed hemagglutination (HA) titers similar to the wild-type (WT) fimA (Supplementary file 7). However, several mutations (A25R, V32R, V65R, V85R, and P145R) abolished the production of adhesive pili (Supplementary file 7). This suggests that these mutations, which are located in areas of high conservation throughout the FimA monomer, may disrupt critical interactions with FimC or FimD or may not be able to correctly fold, thus preventing the assembly of the pilus. Notably, each of these residues was either under strong purifying selection pressure (A25, V85 and P145) or was too conserved for evolutionary analysis (codons for V32 and V65 displayed no synonymous mutations and extremely limited non-synonymous mutation rates), which emphasizes their importance in assembly of the type 1 pilus rod (Figure 3A). Expression of some mutant fimA genes, particularly V5R, E45R, E121R and A142R, resulted in a bacterial clumping phenotype when grown in static culture. D62R and D114R also instigated bacterial clumping, but to a lesser extent. Three of these substitutions, E45R, E121R and A142R, are found in residues with relatively high variability in our analysis of FimA sequences, with just 33.9%, 62.3%, and 52.1% sequence identity, respectively.

Since type 1 pili are assembled from FimA subunits into a helical coil, they normally extend in three force phases: linearly increasing, constant force, linearly increasing \u2013 where the characteristic constant force originates from sequential unwinding of subunits (region between the dashed lines in Figure 4A). The characteristic constant force extension enables the clear identification of instances where multiple pili are attached to a single microsphere, thus enabling us to determine the unwinding force of a single pilus (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). The unwinding force directly relates to the strength of layer-to-layer interactions (e.g., between subunits N0 and N+3), thus any changes in these interactions caused by mutations would shift the magnitude of the force plateau. To investigate this, we first measured unwinding force of single pili in the strain expressing WT FimA and subsequently examined the force response for each fimA mutant. The unwinding force of WT pili was 30.3 \u00b1 0.2 pN (mean \u00b1standard error (SE)) whereas all mutants showed a reduction in the force required for pilus unwinding (Figure 4B). The unwinding force measured for WT type 1 pili in this study is similar to what has been reported in the literature (Andersson et al., 2007). In particular, the A22R variant showed the largest reduction in the unwinding force, 11.2 \u00b1 0.2 pN. We can explain this by the fact that Ala22 in our rod model is tightly packed against Ala93 from another subunit and Val37 from a third subunit (Figure 4C). Thus, replacing a small alanine with a long arginine side chain is expected to disrupt this interface.",

To determine if mutations in the FimA sequence altered UPEC pathogenesis in relevant mouse models, we constructed UTI89 strains with clean single codon mutations in the chromosomal fimA gene (with the phase-variable fimS promoter intact). For these studies, we chose to investigate the effects of four FimA mutants that were examined via optical tweezers. Each of these mutations were made in the codon of a highly conserved amino acid positions of FimAUTI89 (A22, D62, D114, and P132).",

However, the D114R and D62R mutant strains had reduced rates of chronic cystitis of 20% and 10%, respectively. Interestingly, 100% of mice infected with the A22R variant resolved their infections over the 4 week experiment, with half of the mice (10/20) exhibiting sterile urines by 10 dpi compared to just 15% (3/20) of mice infected with the WT strain at the same time point (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3). The defect in chronic infection caused by fimA variants is likely due to pathogenic deficiencies during acute UTI. Accordingly, we found that two fimA variants (A22R and D114R) significantly altered the ability of UTI89 to form IBCs at 6 hr post infection (hpi) (Figure 5G), with 8/10 mice infected with the D114R variant forming <15 IBCs. Even more strikingly, 70% of mice infected with the A22R variant formed no IBCs at 6 hpi and the other 30% formed three or less. This is in stark contrast to WT and P132R strains, which formed between 50\u2013100 IBCs on average by 6hpi. Interestingly, the A22R mutant was severely attenuated in its ability to invade into bladder cells starting as early as 1 hr post infection (Figure 5H). The D62R variant was defective in chronic cystitis in both the competitive and single bladder infections, but no acute fitness defects were observed. Further, mice infected with D62R formed a similar number of IBCs as the WT strain at 6 hpi, suggesting that the defect occurs at a later time-point. Accordingly, in mice singly infected with fimA D62R bacterial clearance is delayed, starting between 10\u201314 days (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3).",

Deletion of the operon encoding the type 1 pilus or the FimH adhesin impedes intestinal colonization by UTI89 (Spaulding et al., 2017). Therefore, we tested the impact of each of our four chromosomal FimA genetic variants on UPEC intestinal colonization levels. We found that strains producing FimAUTI89 variants D62R, D114R, and A22R showed lower levels of intestinal colonization (by up to 2 logs) in the feces, cecum, and colon of mice compared to those colonized by WT fimA (Figure 6). This 2-log decrease mirrors the defect observed in UTI89\u0394fim or UTI89\u0394fimH strains, suggesting that these mutations prevent type 1 pilus-dependent gut colonization in UTI89 (Spaulding et al., 2017). While not statistically significant, fimAUTI89 P132R variant showed lower colonization (by up to one log) in the feces and cecum than the WT strain (Figure 6). Together, our data indicates that the sequence of the FimA major subunit is critical for pilus function in the bladder and gut and thus has a major impact on the outcome of UTI.",

In particular, it is exceedingly difficult to crystallize most helical polymers, as unless such a polymer has exactly two, three, four or six subunits per turn, it cannot be packed in any crystal space group so that all subunits are in equivalent environments. The type 1 pilin, FimA, has been extensively studied by x-ray crystallography and solution NMR, while the type 1 pilus has only been studied at high resolution by solid-state NMR (Habenstein et al., 2015). We show here that type 1 filaments, present as a background in a preparation of T4P, allow us to reach a near-atomic level of resolution and build an atomic model for the FimA rod. The ability of cryo-EM to separate out multiple conformations among particles (Gui et al., 2017; Vonck and Mills, 2017) or even of subunits within the same particle (Roh et al., 2017) has been one of the greatest strengths of cryo-EM, allowing for multiple states to be solved from the same micrographs. Biochemically heterogeneous preparations, such as when virions are a mixture of empty particles and those containing DNA (Dong et al., 2017) are now routinely sorted out into homogeneous structural classes. We have taken advantage of that strength here to show that filament images which might otherwise have been discarded as a background contaminant can actually be used to build an atomic model. Our type 1 pilus rod model provides new insights into structure-function relationships in type 1 pili.",

We identified three mutations in FimAUTI89 (A22R, D114R, and D62R) that expressed adhesive pili in vitro but reduced the ability of UTI89 to colonize the bladder, acutely and chronically. One of these mutants, FimAUTI89 A22R, was severely attenuated during acute infection, forming almost no IBCs and thus was unable to chronically infect the mouse bladder.",

            "text": "We hypothesize that the identified FimA point mutants handicap UPEC pathogenicity in vivo by altering the properties of the pilus rod. The pilus rod is hypothesized to act as a \u2018molecular spring\u2019 transitioning between a flexible, linear fiber and a coiled helix. This spring-like property is thought to prevent the pilus from breaking or detaching from the host surface by temporarily expanding to a linear form after encountering shear forces, which can occur in the bladder during urine voiding or in the gut during fecal or mucus shedding. Such a transition between the helical and unwound form of the FimA homopolymer has been predicted to significantly dampen the force experienced by the adhesion-receptor complex at the tip (Zakrisson et al., 2012). Since FimA-FimA interactions create the bulk of the pilus rod, mutations that reduce the stability of these protein-protein interactions can alter the ability of the pilus rod to withstand shear forces, which we discovered has detrimental effects on pilus function and pathogenesis. This is consistent with ~50% of the residues in the mature FimA protein (79/161) being invariant (Figure 3), which includes almost every residue involved in a subunit-subunit interface in the rod. Pili formed with the WT FimABW25113 protein require more than twice the force to unwind than the pili formed by the FimA BW25113 variant with an A22R mutation (~30 pN vs. 11pN), likely due to steric clashes caused by this substitution affecting the tightly packed interface between subunits. Thus, we hypothesize that the pilus formed by the FimA A22R mutant variant may not have the strength to absorb and withstand the shear forces experienced during urination and thus allow the bacteria to be swept out of the bladder, preventing infection. In the gut, the pilus rod may play a similar role during mucus shedding. A recent study suggests that type 1 pili may promote UPEC colonization of the upper crypts (Spaulding et al., 2017). These bacteria would likely experience constant, low levels of shear force during mucus turnover and thus need the pilus to withstand some force to enable the bacteria to maintain their intestinal niche. Accordingly, three of the fimAUTI89 mutants (A22R, D114R, and D62R) that were attenuated in bladder colonization also displayed significantly reduced intestinal colonization. However, in general, the phenotypes of the fimAUTI89 mutants in gut colonization were not as severe as in the bladder.",

This clumping phenotype was also seen in the equivalent mutants in FimABW25113 (D62R, D114R). These residues are located on the exterior surface of the rod structure and do not have as strong an effect on the force needed for unwinding as FimABW2511 A22R. However, the clumping phenotype suggests that these mutations may alter side-to-side interactions between different pilus rods promoting pilus-pilus interactions within and between bacteria, thus inhibiting the pilus mediated interactions needed in vivo for attachment, invasion and/or IBC formation. Interestingly, we do not observe a defect in bladder colonization in mice infected with FimAUTI89 D62R until 10dpi, suggesting that normal rod function is needed during both chronic and acute infection.",

FimA displays patterns of episodic, divergent selection on surface exposed amino acids in a pattern that is similar, though much less robust, to what is seen in the flagellin protein in Salmonella (Li et al., 1994). In Salmonella, the flagellin subunits are split into several domains where the domains responsible for subunit-subunit assembly are highly conserved while the more external domains of the protein show high rates of variability (Andersen-Nissen et al., 2005; Galkin et al., 2008). The Salmonella flagellin protein is immunogenic, but the regions that induce inflammatory response are found in the conserved domains of the protein (Wildschutte et al., 2004). While it is known that flagellin are bound by Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) resulting in the induction of the innate immune response (Smith and Ozinsky, 2002) and that this recognition is targeted towards conserved features of flagellin (Andersen-Nissen et al., 2005), it is currently unknown which, if any, host immune receptor are capable of recognizing the FimA rod or subunits or which structural features are targeted by the host immune system. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the host pressures and responses that are influencing the evolution of the FimA rod structure.",

Notably, we saw that different phenotypes caused by mutations in the FimA protein were associated with different classes of selection pressure. For example, the bacterial clumping phenotype is associated with mutation of three codons under purifying selection, but an equal number of the mutations that resulted in clumping are in codons with little to no evidence of selective pressure. In contrast, all mutations that failed to complement a fimA gene deletion were made in codons that are under very strong purifying selection or are too conserved for analysis. Together, the difference in selection pressure suggests that the mis-assembly of the pilus is much more harmful and/or toxic to E. coli than bacterial clumping. Further, the integration of evolutionary analysis with in vivo and in vitro functional analysis allowed us to decouple the selection pressures acting to preserve amino acid sites necessary for pilus assembly (such as P145in FimAUTI89) from the selection pressure maintaining the codons that were necessary for pilus function (such as A22 in FimAUTI89). Given the intricacy of pilus assembly, one could expect that most of the codons under purifying selection would be related to pilus construction. Instead, we found that many codons under purifying selection are involved in keeping the force needed to unwind the type 1 rod within a narrow range. This leads to reasoning that a \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018loose\u2019 FimA rod may be just as detrimental for E. coli as having no rod at all, at least in the eyes of evolution.",

Further studies of the hundreds of CUP pili encoded in Gram-negative bacteria are needed to further understand the unique and general aspects of the evolution of CUP pilus fibers. In addition, other bacterial pili, such as T4P, which have arisen independently of CUP pili but can play similar roles in pathogenesis, can also elongate under force (Biais et al., 2010) and thus it remains an interesting question as to how the physical properties of other pili have been selected for particular environments and how these properties impact bacterial pathogenesis.",

            "text": "To prepare a sample we suspended bacteria in 1xPBS to a concentration (1:1000 of OD600 = 1) suitable for single cell analysis using optical tweezers (OT). Surfactant-free 2.5 \u00b5m amidine polystyrene microspheres (product no. 3\u20132600, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were similarly suspended in Milli-Q water, these microspheres were trapped and used as force probes. To mount bacteria and reduce the influence of surface interactions we prepared a 1:500 suspension of 9.5 mm carboxylate-modified latex microspheres (product no.2\u201310000, Interfacial Dynamics, Portland, OR) in Milli-Q. We dropped ten microliters of the microsphere-water suspension onto 24 \u00d7 60 mm coverslips (no.1, Knittel Glass, Braunschweig, Germany) and placed these in an oven for 60 min at 60\u00b0C to immobilize the microspheres to the surface. To firmly adhere bacteria to the microspheres, we added a solution of 20 mL of 0.01% poly-L-lysine (catalog no. P4832, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to the coverslips, which, after 45 min incubation at 60\u00b0C, were stored until use. A free-floating bacterium was trapped by the optical tweezers run at low power to avoid cell damage. The bacterium was thereafter mounted on a large 9.5 \u00b5m microsphere coated with poly-L-lysine. We trapped a small free-floating 2.5 \u00b5m microsphere by the optical tweezers with normal power (a few hundreds of mW) and brought it close to (within tens of \u00b5m) but not in direct contact with, the bacterium. To calibrate the trap stiffness we used the Power spectrum method by sampling the microspheres position at 131,072 Hz and average 32 consecutive data sets acquired for 0.25 s each (Toli\u0107-N\u00f8rrelykke et al., 2006). Typically, the trap constant was found to be ~140 pN/\u00b5m for an output laser power of 800 mW. After calibration, the small microsphere was gently brought close to the bacterium in order to attach a pilus with the microsphere (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1). To extend a single pilus (Figure 4) the piezo stage was moved at a constant speed of 10 nm/s and the sampling frequency was set to 10,000 Hz that was downsampled by 800. Occasionally, we measured the responses of multiple pili attached to the bead resulting in a force-extension response as the sum of all attached pili. This was, however, not a problem in general since the shorter pili detached from the bead in a sequential order, leaving only the single, longest pili attached to the bead for measurement (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). Finally, we controlled the piezo-stage and sampled the data using an in-house LabView program (Andersson, 2018; copy archived at https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ot-control).",

Then the grids were plunge-frozen using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI, Inc.), and subsequently imaged in a Titan Krios at 300keV with a Falcon II direct electron detector (pixel size 1.05 \u00c5/pixel). A total of 6803 images, each of which was from a total exposure of 2 s dose-fractionated into seven chunks, were collected at a range of underfocus between 0.5 ~ 3 \u03bcm. Images were motion corrected using MotionCorr (Li et al., 2013), and the program CTFFIND3 (Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003) was used for determining the defocus and astigmatism. Images with poor CTF estimation as well as defocus >3 \u03bcm were discarded. The SPIDER software package (Frank et al., 1996) was used for most other operations with the first two-chunk sums (containing a dose of ~20 electrons/ \u00c52) of the motion-corrected image stacks. The CTF was corrected by multiplying the images from the first two-chunk sums with the theoretical CTF, which is a Wiener filter in the limit of a very poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This both corrects the phases which need to be flipped and improves the SNR. The e2helixboxer routine within EMAN2 (Tang et al., 2007) was used for boxing the filaments from the images. A total of 72,627 overlapping segments (384 px long), with a shift of 11 px between adjacent segments (~97% overlap), were used for the IHRSR (Egelman, 2000) reconstruction. With a featureless cylinder as a starting reference, 72,627 segments were used in IHRSR cycles until the helical parameters (axial rise and rotation per subunit) converged. Analysis of the population suggested that the axial rise was fairly fixed, but that the twist was variable. Using a reference-based sorting with models having a fixed rise but a variable twist, approximately 55% of the segments were excluded, having a twist outside of the range 114.4\u00b0 to 115.6\u00b0. A sub-set of 32,726 segments were used for a few more cycles of IHRSR. The resolution of the final reconstruction was determined by the FSC between two independent half maps, generated from two non-overlapping data sets, which was 4.2 \u00c5 at FSC = 0.143.",

Full-length sequences were extracted from the genomes using Geneious v 6.1.7, trimmed to remove signal sequences, and aligned using the MUSCLE program (Edgar, 2004). A phylogenetic tree was estimated using the RAxML program (Stamatakis, 2006) with the GTRCAT model and supported with 1000 bootstraps (Stamatakis et al., 2008). Evidence for episodic, diversifying selection was then identified using a random effects likelihood ratio test for each branch of the fimA phylogenetic tree (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011) using unique sequences from the genomes (32 duplicates removed, n = 25). Branches showing statistically significant evidence for episodic, diversifying selection, as measured by a chi-squared test were then indicated on the corresponding branches of the phylogenetic tree constructed using RAxML.",
