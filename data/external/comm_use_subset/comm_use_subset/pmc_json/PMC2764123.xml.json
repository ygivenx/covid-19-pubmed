Infection control practices for most CF centres reflect recently published infection control guidelines suggesting that patients should maintain a distance of at least 1 m to reduce the risk of cross-infection.12 The risk of acquisition of infection from respiratory aerosols is complex and probably relates to the pathogen type, concentration of the organism in the aerosol, the susceptibility of exposed individuals and the environment (air movement, relative humidity, temperature, etc). Limited studies have examined particle size distribution of respiratory aerosols and most have reported large droplet formation, predominantly particles with a diameter of >8 \u03bcm.27 28 More recently, Papineni and Rosenthal reported that 85% of particles were <1 \u03bcm and that coughing produced more aerosol particles than did breathing or talking.29 The first published study to use a CASS examined patients with tuberculosis and, like our study, found that most of the respiratory particles were <3.3 \u03bcm.14 Our study shows that patients with CF produce culturable aerosols in a wide range of particle sizes including both respiratory droplets and infectious droplet nuclei. We have shown this predominantly for clonal P aeruginosa and, in a small number of patients, for other non-fermentative Gram-negative organisms including B cenocepacia. We do not know the ideal site of deposition in the respiratory tract for P aeruginosa to establish infection in patients with CF, and either large or small droplets or both may be important in the pathogenesis.",

Our data show that the concentration of bacteria in the sputum and the forced expiratory flow rates were related to cough aerosol concentration, with a trend for association with higher peak flow and higher body mass index. These data suggest that patients with milder lung disease, perhaps as a result of stronger cough, may have an increased risk of producing infectious aerosols. This warrants further investigation as the improvement in clinical outcomes in patients with CF may potentially increase the risk of spread of clonal strains of P aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria.",

First, the study was not powered to examine the effects of many of the clinical variables such as exacerbations or strain of P aeruginosa on the production of cough aerosols. In particular, there were few patients with unique strains of P aeruginosa and none who produced high concentrations of cough aerosols. The association between a specific strain and obtaining a positive air sample could not therefore be determined. Second, the media in the Andersen plates was selective for Gram-negative organisms and thus it is not possible to generalise these results to patients with CF infected with Gram-positive bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi. Third, we did not perform reproducibility or efficiency studies of the CASS. Fourth, the studies of tidal breathing were in a select group of patients who did not undertake hypertonic saline-induced cough studies and further work is required to evaluate the extent to which tidal breathing is associated with the generation of potentially infective particles. Finally, while this study provides evidence that patients with CF and Gram-negative infection can produce potentially infectious cough aerosols, we cannot draw conclusions about transmission to susceptible individuals. A recent study examined the survival of P aeruginosa in vitro and found bacterial survival, at least for a limited time period of <90 s, to be favoured by lower temperature and mucoid phenotype.35 While providing further evidence that airborne transmission is plausible, transmission by this route is yet to be proved beyond doubt.",
