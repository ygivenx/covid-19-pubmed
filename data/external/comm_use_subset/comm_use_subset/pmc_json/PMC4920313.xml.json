            "text": "Bats are associated with numerous zoonotic pathogens, including SARS Coronavirus and Ebola virus, that have emerged unpredictably into human and domestic animal populations with serious health and economic consequences [1]. A central impediment to forecasting the cross-species transmission of bat viruses and developing strategies for their control is the scarcity of data that could inform how these viruses are maintained in their bat reservoirs [2]. In particular, data from bats are usually collected from small geographical areas over short timescales, whereas the high mobility of bats can enable long-term viral persistence across large spatial scales [3]. By contrast, cross-species infections (\u2018spillovers\u2019) can span large areas and timescales, but rarely occur at sufficiently high frequency to enable robust inference into transmission dynamics within bats and are often complicated by the possibility of onward transmission within spillover host species [2].",

            "text": "In Latin America, common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are the most important source of human and animal rabies, a lethal encephalitis transmitted by the bites of infected animals [4]. The widespread distribution of the vampire bat, from Mexico to Argentina, coupled with a mechanism for cross-species transmission (obligatory blood feeding behaviour) creates high economic, social and public health burdens of rabies across the region [5]. Although post-exposure vaccination of humans and pre-exposure vaccination of livestock are available and efficacious, they are not practiced at large scales [5,6]. Instead, control of vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) uses bat population control, either by indiscriminate killing and roost destruction or by government-led campaigns that use a poisonous paste, \u2018vampiricide\u2019, to kill bats that groom treated conspecifics or feed from the wounds of treated livestock [7,8]. The efficacy of these programmes has been questioned by field studies showing that rates of VBR exposure in bats were equivalent or higher in culled colonies and independent of natural variation in bat colony size [9]. Further modelling work showed that apparently counterproductive effects of culling could arise because VBR persists not locally within a bat colony, but by viral dispersal between colonies [10].",

            "text": "Identifying the precise nature of spatial dynamics and how these contribute to long-term viral persistence is critical to improving rabies control. Detection of epizootic expansions or seasonally varying transmission could help anticipate when and where spillover could occur, thereby enabling preventative vaccination of humans and livestock or interventions within the bat population ahead of outbreaks [11,12]. Because rabies is not transmitted among livestock following infection by bats, livestock provide an ideal sentinel to study the spatiotemporal dynamics within the natural bat reservoir. To date, phylogenetic and time-series analyses of VBR in livestock have revealed contrasting patterns. Epizootics were reported in the north of Argentina in the 1970s [13], but more recent analyses show continuous infection of livestock, indicative of enzootic persistence [5,9,12,14\u201316]. However, incidence varies within enzootic zones and is speculated to be affected by natural and anthropogenic processes. On the one hand, livestock vaccination or bat culls could conceivably decrease the burden and transmission of VBR, respectively, if practiced intensively. Yet, land use and climate changes could offset these gains by providing greater availability of livestock (a key food resource for bats) and increasing minimal winter temperatures, which together limit the size and geographical range of vampire bats [17]. If VBR outbreaks are increasing, determining whether increases are caused by spatial expansions into previously uninfected areas or intensified transmission within enzootic zones is critical to appropriately allocate vaccines, surveillance and educational campaigns.",

Because rabies transmitted by dogs is restricted to a small, isolated region of Peru, virtually all livestock cases are spillover infections from vampire bats [18,19]. This unique dataset creates a remarkable opportunity to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying the perpetuation of VBR in bat populations and thereby inform control strategies across Latin America. Here, using high-resolution time-series data on VBR outbreaks, we: (i) resolve the spatiotemporal patterns underlying previously undetected increases in the burden of VBR in Peru, (ii) test whether increases are caused by spatial expansions or intensified transmission within historically enzootic zones, and (iii) assess patterns of how spatial expansions occurred across the landscape. Next, in an area of intensive VBR transmission in the Andes, we pair time-series data with field data on bat\u2013livestock contacts, vaccination and reporting practices to (iv) estimate the velocity of advancing epizootics of VBR on a heterogeneous landscape, and (v) forecast impending spillover risks to humans and livestock.",

We tested whether the average elevation of outbreaks changed through time in each region of Peru using generalized linear models (GLM) with normally distributed errors. The Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used for model selection (chosen a difference of more than two AIC points), and the significance of each factor within the selected model was tested using a Wald test [21]. We also tested the overall effect of year on outbreak elevation using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with region as a random effect using the glmmADMB package of R. District and elevation maps were obtained from the GADM database (gadm.org) and the CGIAR-CSI (http://www.cgiar-csi.org/) respectively, using the raster package of R.

A sensitivity analysis for this assumption using 200 randomly selected elevation thresholds from 3500 to 4500 m for each of the two valleys is provided in the electronic supplementary material. The index cases of each travelling wave were estimated by simulating 5000 random hypothetical origins of each wave and choosing the origin that maximized the R2 of each linear regression [23]. Wavefront speeds were calculated as the inverse of the slope of the linear regression with the intercept set to zero. We evaluated the sensitivity of wavefront speeds to the inferred origin by bootstrap resampling (with replacement) the hexbins used in the main analysis. In each of 200 bootstrap replicates in each valley, we evaluated 5000 random hypothetical origins and identified the origin location that maximized the R2 of the distance/time regression.

The trigger(s) of these expansions are uncertain, but they are occurring throughout the country in transition zones between the Amazon and Andes and in valleys within the Andes (figure 3). One possibility is that growing livestock populations could have increased the size or connectivity of vampire bat populations, facilitating viral introduction [5]. However, livestock census data from 1994 and 2012 indicate no change in livestock densities in the newly infected districts (Peruvian National Livestock Census, CENAGRO). Another hypothesis is that rising temperatures due to climate change could expand bat populations and thus VBR to higher elevations [17]. Indeed, our GLMM shows that VBR is spreading on average to higher elevations. Importantly however, expansions occurred in areas well below the maximum elevation of VBR in other parts of the Peru (3600 mts), and the elevation of outbreaks did not increase in high elevation regions where VBR was enzootic throughout the time series (i.e. Apurimac and Ayacucho; figure 3). Thus, we argue that the emergence of VBR in these regions is caused not by climate-driven changes in the vampire bat distribution, but instead an epidemiological process of protracted viral invasion of a relatively new virus in vampire bat populations, a hypothesis supported by molecular clock estimates of the most recent common ancestor of vampire bat rabies [26]. In further support for the slow invasion hypothesis, the travelling waves in the two focal valleys of AAC were initiated only in the last few years despite molecular evidence that VBR was present in northwestern parts of the region since the early 1970s and the evidence from our questionnaire study that vampire bats are already present in rabies-free parts of each valley [14] (figure 5a).",

            "text": "The slow wavefront speeds that we observe in vampire bats relative to other rabies reservoirs (e.g. 30\u2013100 km yr\u22121 in raccoons) and their low variability is more consistent with short distance dispersal of infected bats than invasion driven by rare long distance flights [27]. Indeed, although translocation experiments show that vampire bats are physiologically capable of long distance movements, home range sizes are typically <10 km2 [9,24,28]. One remaining question is why waves are travelling at different rates in different valleys. Different patterns of between-colony bat movements in each valley driven by underlying differences in the distribution of bat colonies could influence wave speeds. However, valleys had similar distributions of farms and intensities of bites (electronic supplementary material, figure S5), suggesting that long distance dispersal of VBR is unlikely to be a limiting factor in either valley. Anthropogenic disturbances, particularly the intensity of bat culls, could also conceivably influence viral spread. On the one hand, culls could reduce the probability of dispersal by an infected bat by reducing infection prevalence or competition-driven dispersal. On the other hand, dispersal by survivors of culls could facilitate viral invasion into uninfected areas. A similar example of disturbance-driven pathogen spread was observed in the UK, where disruption of badger territorial boundaries by culling facilitated the spatial spread of bovine tuberculosis [29]. Finally, differences in wavefront speeds could potentially arise if viral strains with different infection phenotypes circulate in each valley. However, previous work showed that only one geographically isolated viral lineage has circulated in the AAC since the early 1970s [14]. Therefore, we suspect that the waves described here have a common evolutionary origin, and recent evolution is unlikely to explain the observed variation in wavefront speeds.",

It is difficult to quantify the real impact of these viral invasions on agriculture, because under-reporting of VBR is thought to be significant but remains unquantified in most areas of Latin America, precluding estimation of the true burden of the disease on livestock [30]. In the two AAC valleys alone, we forecast that over 11 600 small-scale farms, containing at least 339 000 livestock (93 715 cows, 215 707 sheep, 15 690 goats and 13 774 pigs) will newly be at risk of rabies in the next 3 years. Vaccination of these animals would cost at least US$373 000 per year (US$1.1 per vaccine); a significant financial burden to small-scale farmers who rely on livestock sales to pay for house maintenance and childhood education and for local governments that have not previously been affected by rabies. The high cost of vaccines, together with low local knowledge of rabies indicated by our questionnaires, presents a major challenge to overcome with epizootic invasion impending.",

Like all predictive models, our projection uncertainty increases further into the future; thus, it will be useful to update models as additional data become available. Nevertheless, the consistency of wavefront speeds, even after considering uncertainty in origin locations, and the ability of our model to successfully predict known dates of rabies arrival provide confidence in our forecasts. Although our phenomenological models of rabies spread account for habitat heterogeneity using a least-cost distance algorithm, other methods exist for estimating wavefront speed. Statistical methods such as trend surface analysis are used over larger spatial and time scales than our data, where outbreaks are distributed along relatively short valleys. Spatially explicit mechanistic models have also been widely used to model rabies spread in carnivores in heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. [27,31]). Unfortunately, the dispersal distances of infected bats and the sizes of colonies are unknown, so parameterization of such a model for VBR would not be straightforward. Moreover, without additional data, such models would not be expected to alter our mean predictions. We therefore argue our approach is ideally suited to inform rapid responses in a public health and veterinary emergency.",

The waves of VBR that we identify are important, because they are occurring in real time and are predictable in speed and trajectory, creating a powerful opportunity to direct the distribution of vaccines and educational campaigns to areas where infection is imminent (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Our results further open new possibilities for the control of a bat-borne zoonosis in its reservoir. While interventions such as culling have historically focused on enzootic areas, our findings enable targeting of healthy bat populations before viral invasion. Such a strategy was attempted in Argentina in the 1970s, but even with a dramatic 95% reduction of vampire bat populations using cyanide poisoning, the epizootic advanced [34]. This failure could reflect an absence of natural geographical barriers allowing the virus to circumnavigate the intervention zone or the challenges of using population reduction to control a pathogen with frequency-dependent transmission [9,10,35]. An appealing alternative would be to increase the proportion of immunized bats while maintaining the age structure and relatively sedentary dispersal behaviour of vampire bats. A transmissible gel-based topical rabies vaccine was effective in captive vampire bats but has never been released in wild populations [36]. Vaccination ahead of the epizootic front could be particularly effective when paired with natural geographical barriers such as the high Andean peaks that occur in the AAC.",
