The principles in the Full Joint Statement by Funders of Health Research [2] were the starting point for the MSF policy, namely, that data should be shared in a manner that is ethical, equitable, and efficient. MSF consulted with the Wellcome Trust and the MSF Ethics Review Board [15] to adapt and expand these principles to include ones specific for MSF concerning highly sensitive data, benefit sharing, and intellectual property. The policy was drafted using a template from the UK National Cancer Research Institute [16].",

Only data whose dissemination is judged to have the potential to lead to greater health benefits for populations will be shared (Box 2). Practically, this decision-making process will be implemented through a procedure whereby MSF data judged to have a substantial public health benefit are eligible to be proposed by any MSF or Epicentre staff for inclusion in the online collection. The decision to include data will be guided by the vision and principles of the data sharing policy, and data should not be unreasonably withheld.
