According to the WHO, in Oct, 2017, fact sheet pointed out that the TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide [1]. It spreads from person to person through the air. One person may be infected by TB when only inhaling a few of TB germs. So, many scientists studied the characteristics including codon usage pattern [2], promoter architecture of toxin-antitoxin systems [3], drug-resistance [4], molecular epidemiology [5], protein function and immunogenicity [6], and drugs for the treatment [7] of TB. Typically, Sheen et al. studied the multiple genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and found out some specific novel genes and mutations associated with pyrazinamide resistance [8]. Sun et al. and Khrustalev et al. characterize the mutations in streptomycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis [9, 10]. Recently, bioinformatics tools are widely used for analyzing the TB [11].",

Many factors may affect the codon usage in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, such as mutation pressure [12], gene length [13], and natural selection [14]. Most previous studies deal with the relatively smaller set of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates [15, 16] or the isolates from one area [17, 18]. In this paper, genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 12 areas is compared and analyzed. So, the objectives of this study aim to deal with the following issues: (1) correlation between codon preference parameters such as the codon usage index (CBI), the effective number of codons (ENC), the overall GC content, the codon adaptation index (CAI), and the Frequency of Optimal Codons (FOP); (2) mutation and evolution characteristics via the relationship between ENC and the GC3 of the whole 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes; (3) phylogenetic analysis via RSCU values of the separated genomes for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",

Although many scientists endeavor to study the Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the genetic perspective [32, 33] for its very important for defending tuberculosis [34], its codon usage bias is not very clear until now. In this study, not only are traditional methods, such as ENC-plot, PR2 analysis, RSCU values, and phylogenetic analysis of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes, studied, but also some new methods, CBI versus ENC and protein length versus GC3S/GC12, are all explored; the former relationship describing the relationship between CBI and ENC could reveal their negative correlation characteristics. Relationship between protein length and GC content (GC3S and GC12) can reflect the changes of GC content within different coding sequences during the evolutionary process. Previous studies indicated that genetic diversity exists in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from different tuberculosis [35] when the samples are from different areas. Many studies also revealed that the host is an important factor that can affect the codon usage characteristics [36]. Overall RSCU values of overall 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes (Figure 4) and their separated genomes (Figure 5) all reveal strong codon usage bias. All these results combined with the relationship between CBI and ENC, protein length, and GC content (GC3 and GC12) show that the natural selection pressure is a little more important than mutation pressure. There are only 12 genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis analyzed in this work; although Mycobacterium tuberculosis exists in almost all countries. We selected 12 geographically representative genomes in order to analyze their regional differences. Codon usage differences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from broader range and even from one area are not mentioned in this work; it is necessary to expand the scope of the genomes in the further study.",

The codon usage pattern and its influencing factors, especially, were identified for 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. It is observed that codon usage patterns in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are influenced by GC3 bias. Correlation between codon bias index and GC3 (=0.618) shows that the GC3 bias of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes may also reflect its codon bias index. Majorities of the codons are G/C ended; this phenomenon combined with a negative correlation between overall GC-content and CAI may indicate the important role of compositional constraints and mutation pressure in shaping the codon usage bias in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. We performed the comparative analysis of codon usage bias in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes from different area. The results would help further elucidate the underlying dynamics of genetic evolution in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. These results showed that codon usage bias exists in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes.
