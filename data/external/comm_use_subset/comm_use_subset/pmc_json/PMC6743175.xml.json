HRV is the most common virus found in AECOPD with some studies reporting up to 69% among all the viral isolates [6]. Among the respiratory viruses, HRV infection preceded as many as 50% of asthma exacerbations in children [11]. Over 100 types of HRVs have been characterized and classified into 3 groups: HRV-A, HRV-B, and more recently HRV-C [12]. With advances in technology, it is now possible to identify different groups of HRV [13]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no data on the types of HRV that may precipitate AECOPD. There are very limited data on the subtypes of HRV that is related to adults with asthma exacerbations [14]. Furthermore it is unknown that if certain viral infections would be associated with worse clinical outcomes of the patients, such as prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) and readmissions.",

A previous study suggested that protective serum antibody titres in COPD patients after influenza vaccination was lower than control subjects [32]. Overall the mortality benefit of influenza vaccine in COPD is suggested by some studies but the impact on exacerbation prevention is less clear [33]. Another systemic review indicated a favorable benefit-risk ratio for seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with COPD [34]. For persons with asthma, a recent systematic review observed that influenza vaccination might be effective in both reducing influenza infection and asthma attacks [35]. However, another Cochrane review has expressed uncertainty of the degree of protection that influenza vaccination might confer against asthma exacerbations that are related to influenza infection [36]. During the study period from August 2016 to July 2017, influenza A(H3N2) was the main circulating strain causing the Summer and Winter epidemics in Hong Kong [37]. Influenza vaccine effectiveness depends on many factors including matching between vaccine strains and the circulating strains, immunocompetence, age, repeated vaccination, antigenic sites and distances in addition to egg adaptation especially for influenza A(H3N2) virus [38]. A previous systematic review found substantial variations in influenza vaccine effectiveness across types and subtypes of influenza with substantially lower protection against H3N2 [39]. Examination of influenza vaccine effectiveness by serology is beyond the scope of this study as it would require a large sample size. In addition, as these patients had some time delay in presenting to the hospitals, it would be difficult to determine whether this was due to current or previous infection or vaccination by measuring influenza antibody based on haemagglutinin inhibition. While identification of pathogens in the NPA was associated with a lower rate of readmissions for asthma, exacerbations of COPD and asthma might also be due to other acute and transient factors such as exposure to air pollutants [4, 5], change in temperature, etc.",

As the study mainly aimed to assess the subjects in exacerbation state, only 1/5 the number of exacerbation of subjects were recruited as controls. Furthermore, the same subjects were not tested between exacerbations due to the limitation of budget. The exacerbation and stable state subjects were not matched for gender, age and inhaler therapies. There were other factors that might be associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations, e.g. air pollution, weather changes, allergic sensitization, etc. that were not investigated. Bacterial infection might also play a part in AECOPD and this was not assessed in this study. Interaction of the microorganisms with other factors such as air pollutions and weather may be important. Although viral and atypical bacteria were identified in some subjects with exacerbations, we could not establish a causative role as some stable subjects also had pathogens identified in their NPA. The subjects involved in this study had severe airway disease exacerbations requiring hospitalizations and the result could not be extrapolated to those with milder illnesses being managed in the community.",

Presence of microorganisms in the NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect the clinical outcomes including the hospital LOS, readmissions and mortality except that patients who had infective aetiology identified during asthma exacerbation had lower rates of readmissions at 30 and 60 days.",
