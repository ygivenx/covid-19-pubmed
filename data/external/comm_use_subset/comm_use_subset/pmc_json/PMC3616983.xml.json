The underlying shell of the developing viral particle is formed by the Pr55Gag polyprotein (Gag), which is translated deep within the cytoplasm of cells and reaches the plasma membrane by an unknown mechanism [1], [2], [3]. Gag binds to the viral genomic RNA through its nucleocapsid (NC) region and is responsible for packaging of RNA into the developing particle. A -1 ribosomal frameshift results in the formation of the Gag-Pol precursor protein in a molar ratio of 20\u22361 Gag to Gag-Pol [4]. Gag, Gag-Pol, and the associated viral genomic RNA traffic together to the particle assembly site on the plasma membrane. The envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) of HIV-1 is simultaneously incorporated onto the lipid membrane of the developing particle, and yet must travel via a very different route to reach the assembly site.",

            "text": "Env is synthesized on ribosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum as a precursor protein, gp160 [5]. Trimerization of gp160 is required for exit from the ER [6]. During transit through the Golgi, gp160 becomes heavily glycosylated and the precursor subunits are cleaved by furin-like proteases to create gp41 (TM) and gp120 (SU) subunits. A trimer of heterodimers of TM and SU forms the functional Env glycoprotein complex. Once the mature complex reaches the cell surface, it is either incorporated onto budding virions or rapidly internalized [7], [8], [9], [10]. In contrast to the dense concentration of envelope glycoprotein spikes on the surface of orthomyxoviruses [11], paramyxoviruses [12], herpesviruses [13], and the relative abundance of envelope spikes on gammaretroviruses [14], lentiviral particles incorporate a very limited number of envelope proteins. Estimates from electron tomography studies reveal an average of 8\u201314 trimers per virion particle when virions with full-length HIV envelopes are examined [15], [16]. SIV strains with truncations in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) have been noted to incorporate 70\u201379 trimers and have been widely employed in cryoEM studies of the envelope spike [15], [16], [17]. The reasons for the paucity of Env trimers on lentiviral particles in the absence of mutant CT domains remain unknown.",

The Env CT has been the subject of numerous studies, yet a complete understanding of how the CT mediates incorporation onto budding virions remains elusive. The Env CT includes a membrane-proximal YXX\u03c6 motif that mediates clathrin- and AP2-dependent endocytosis [8], [9], [18], [19], [20] and a number of additional tyrosine-based and dileucine motifs that have been implicated in endocytosis and trafficking of Env [21]. A YW802 motif was reported to interact with TIP47, and by this interaction mediate Env interaction with Gag and incorporation onto particles [22]. Murakami and Freed reported that the long CT of Env is required for particle incorporation into virions and for viral replication in T cell lines and primary cells [23]. This report established the cell type-specific, tail-dependent incorporation onto virions, suggesting that host factors may mediate Env incorporation and be differentially expressed in distinct cell types.",

To directly test this hypothesis, we expressed a constant amount of Gag expression plasmid together with an increasing amount of full-length or cytoplasmic tail-truncated Env. We used the CTdel-144 Env (CT144) [23], which retains only 6 cytoplasmic residues of the tail, in order to determine if the cytoplasmic tail was important in limiting the amount of Env on the particle. Expression of full-length Env in cells increased sequentially with increasing amount of plasmid transfected. The amount of Env on released HIV-1 particles did not continue to increase, however, but instead reached a plateau at levels of 0.8 \u00b5g or more of transfected DNA (Fig. 1A, WT Env). CT144 expression in cells increased similarly, but incorporation onto HIV-1 particles continued in a linear fashion without apparent saturation (Fig. 1A, CT144). The saturation of full-length Env incorporation was further documented by quantitation of Env/Gag ratio in released particles as measured by densitometry (Fig. 1B) or by gp120 and p24 ELISA (Fig. 1C). We confirmed that the pelletable Env observed in these experiments was particle-associated and not due to overexpression of Env and release on microvesicles (Fig. S1). Despite the ability to incorporate Env at higher levels upon overexpression, particles bearing CT144 Env were consistently less infectious as measured using TZM-bl indicator cells (Fig. 1D). A plateau in particle infectivity conferred by WT Env was noted at the same level of Env expression found to be saturating by Western blot or ELISA analysis (Fig. 1D). These results indicated to us that the cytoplasmic tail of Env confers a limitation to Env trimer incorporation onto HIV-1 particles.",

            "text": "Saturation of Env on HIV particles could be due to limiting concentrations of a cellular factor that is required for its trafficking or incorporation. We initially investigated a variety of factors involved in cellular recycling pathways as candidates. Depletion of Rab11a or Rab11b did not significantly diminish Env on particles, yet overexpression of the active, GTP-bound form of Rab11a (Rab11a S20V) diminished cellular and particle-associated Env (Fig. S2). This led us to consider the Rab11 Family Interacting Proteins (Rab11-FIPs) as candidates involved in HIV-1 Env trafficking, reasoning that one of the FIPs may have been saturated by Rab11 S20V overexpression. The Rab11-FIPs were originally identified in a yeast 2-hybrid screen using Rab11aS20V as bait [24]. Rab11-FIPs form parallel coiled-coil homodimers and bind to two Rab11a-GTP molecules, creating a heterotetrameric complex that regulates distinct intracellular membrane trafficking events. To examine the potential involvement of the Rab11-FIPs in Env trafficking, we performed shRNA-mediated depletion of each of the described FIPs in HeLa cells. Cells were transfected with NL4-3 proviral DNA and analyzed for particle output, Env content, and infectivity of the released particles. Knockdown efficiency was assessed by real-time PCR, and varied from 65\u201390% by this assay (Fig. 2A). A striking phenotype was observed in this experiment. Depletion of FIP1C led to markedly diminished particle infectivity, while little effect was seen with depletion of FIP2, FIP3, FIP4, or FIP5 (Fig. 2A). We next verified the knockdown of FIP1C using specific antisera, and examined cellular and viral levels of Env (Fig. 2B). Notably, the cellular levels of gp160 were not altered by FIP1C depletion, while particle-associated Env was markedly lower. Both gp120 and gp41 levels were diminished, suggesting a defect in Env heterotrimer incorporation rather than simply induced shedding of gp120 (Fig. 2B). While depletion of FIP1C removed Env from particles, it had no effect on cellular Env production or on the release of particles (CA bands, Fig. 2B).",

Fig. 2C demonstrates that FIP1C depletion and not transduction with a scrambled shRNA vector depleted cellular FIP1C levels and diminished particle Env incorporation. FIP1C levels were not restored upon expression of the unaltered FIP1C cDNA. In contrast, expression of FIP1C cDNA with silent mutations rendering it resistant to shRNA-mediated depletion was able to fully restore the incorporation of Env onto HIV-1 particles (Fig. 2C, FIP1C cDNA* lanes).

CT144 Env incorporation was not altered by depletion of FIP1C (Fig. 3A, CT144 lanes). The effect of FIP1C depletion was even more striking when the experiment was performed in H9 cells (Fig. 3A, H9 particle lanes). CT144 was very poorly incorporated in control-transduced cells in H9 cells, reflecting cytoplasmic tail-dependent particle incorporation of Env as had been reported [23]. The small amount of incorporated CT144 Env was not altered by FIP1C depletion (Fig. 3A). Particle infectivity measured in supernatants from wildtype NL4-3 virus was diminished upon FIP1C depletion in both HeLa and H9 cells, while NL4-3delCT144 particle infectivity was not altered (Fig. 3B). Notably, the effect of FIP1C depletion on HIV-1 Env incorporation was specific for HIV, as no effect on Env incorporation or particle infectivity was observed for viruses pseudotyped with VSV-G or the amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env (Fig. S3).",

We hypothesized that FIP1C depletion would diminish the specific outward trafficking of HIV-1 Env from this compartment. Cell surface Env was measured in control H9 cells versus those depleted of FIP1C. Cell surface gp120 levels were significantly diminished following FIP1C depletion, while total cellular levels of Env were comparable in control and FIP1C-depleted cells (Fig. 3C and 3D, WT). In contrast, no significant effect on cell surface levels of CT144 Env was observed following FIP1C depletion (Fig. 3C and 3D, CT144). We conclude from this that there is a partial depletion of cell surface Env following FIP1C/RCP depletion, and this depletion is itself dependent upon an intact cytoplasmic tail. We next established a population of H9 cells depleted for FIP1C, and infected this population with NL4-3 virus or NL4-3delCT144 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. No replication of the cytoplasmic tail-truncated virus was observed in H9 cells (Fig. 3E, closed triangles). Wildtype NL4-3 replicated well in H9 cells that had been transduced with control shRNA (filled squares, Fig. 3E). Depletion of FIP1C resulted in markedly delayed and slow replication of NL4-3 (Fig. 3E). At late timepoints, this virus was able to replicate more efficiently, and this was associated with higher levels of FIP1C that developed in the H9 population over time, and not with viral reversion to a FIP1C-independent state (not shown). We concluded from this that FIP1C was essential for Env incorporation and for viral spreading infection.",

HIV-1 Env is found extensively in intracellular compartments as well as on punctate foci on the plasma membrane, making studies of surface redistribution of Env by cellular factors challenging. However, we reasoned that Env might redistribute GFP-FIP1C in a measurable manner. GFP-FIP1C was found predominantly in a focal perinuclear location in HeLa cells in the absence of HIV-1 Env expression (Fig. 4A). Transfection of NL4-3 provirus led to a marked redistribution of GFP-FIP1C to intracellular vesicles and to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). The redistribution of GFP-FIP1C out of the perinuclear compartment was especially evident in fields where cells expressing Env were adjacent to those lacking Env (Fig. 4C). In contrast, transfection of NL4-3delCT144 provirus in general retained the perinuclear distribution of GFP-FIP1C (Fig. 4D). The differences in redistribution of FIP1C out of the perinuclear location were scored by a blinded observer and were significantly different for WT vs. CT144 provirus (Fig. 4E). To determine if this effect was due to Env alone and not to other components of the provirus, the experiment was repeated with expression of WT Env and CT144 Env alone. Again the peripheral redistribution of FIP1C by WT Env was noted, with a much lower level of FIP1C outside of the perinuclear region upon expression of CT144 Env (Fig. 4F). Differences in FIP1C distribution between full-length and CT144 Env were statistically significant (p<0.001 by chi squared test). These results suggest a CT-dependent outward movement of FIP1C.",

            "text": "While FIP1C was critical to Env incorporation onto particles, depletion of Rab11 itself did not significantly alter Env incorporation (discussed further below). To reconcile how a Rab11a-binding protein acting as an adaptor could modulate Env incorporation in a Rab11a-independent manner, we investigated the involvement of Rab14 in Env incorporation. Rab14 has recently been identified as a Rab11-FIP binding protein [27]. These investigators had suggested that Rab14 might interact with the Rab binding domain of multiple Rab11-FIP proteins. We therefore sought to investigate the association of Rab14 with different Rab11-FIPs using a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assay as a method for assessing protein interactions. While we did confirm that Rab14 interacted with FIP1C as well as FIP1B, we did not find any interaction with FIP2 (Supplemental Table S1 in Text S1). All three Rab11-FIP proteins interacted with Rab11a, but none interacted with Rab8a. Given these results, we next evaluated whether Rab14 associated in situ with FIP1C. Fig. 5A demonstrates that GFP-FIP1C colocalized extensively with both Rab11a and Rab14 in a concentrated compartment representing the ERC. However, FIP1C(1\u2013614), which lacks a Rab11a binding domain was distributed throughout the cytosol rather than concentrated in the ERC, and did not colocalize with either Rab11a or Rab14 (Fig. 5B). The carboxyl terminal truncation Rab11-FIP1C(560\u2013649) caused a marked concentration of both Rab11a and Rab14 with the dominant negative construct (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, while GFP- FIP1C(592\u2013649), which retains the Rab11-binding domain, did colocalize extensively with Rab11a, the localization with Rab14 was markedly attenuated (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that Rab14 may not be associating with the Rab11-binding domain as suggested by Kelly at al. (2010). Since Kelly et al. (2010) had suggested that Rab14 associated with other Rab11-FIP proteins through their conserved Rab11-binding domains, we next examined the association of Rab14 with the dominant negative trafficking mutant GFP-FIP2(129\u2013512). While this mutant strongly concentrated Rab11a, it had no effect on Rab14 distribution (Fig. S4). Similarly, we did not observe any effects of a carboxyl terminal fragment of FIP5 on Rab14 distribution, although it did strongly concentrate Rab11a (data not shown). These immunofluorescence studies, combined with yeast two-hybrid results, indicated that Rab14 is not interacting with the Rab binding domain of Rab11-FIP1C, since this helix is strongly conserved in all FIP proteins.",

These results demonstrate that the region proximal to the Rab11-binding domain in FIP1C is responsible for association with Rab14, separate from the Rab11a association requirements. We next confirmed direct binding of WT GFP-FIP1C but not GFP-FIP1C(S580N/S582L) with Rab14 through co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. S5).

We first examined the effects of dominant-negative (S25N) and constitutively-active (Q70L) forms of Rab14 on incorporation of HIV-1 Env. Remarkably, dominant-negative Rab14(S25N) diminished the incorporation of Env onto HIV-1 particles in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6A). Constitutively-active Rab14(Q70L) expression had the opposite effect, and resulted in an enhanced level of particle-incorporated Env (Fig. 6A, Rab14Q70L). These results supported an important role for Rab14 in HIV-1 Env incorporation. In the absence of FIP1C, the enhancement of particle-incorporated Env by Rab14(Q70L) was not observed (Fig. S6A). Consistent with our prior findings of CT-dependence, Rab14 constitutively-active and dominant-negative constructs had no effect on incorporation of CT144 Env onto particles (Fig. 6A, rightmost panels). Combined with the interaction mapping data above, these data strongly suggest that an interaction between FIP1C and Rab14 is required for incorporation of full-length HIV-1 Env onto particles.",

            "text": "To evaluate further the role of Rab14 on Env incorporation, we depleted Rab14 or Rab11a in HeLa cells using shRNA and compared the effects on Env incorporation. Rab14 depletion, but not Rab11a depletion, diminished HIV-1 Env incorporation (Fig. 6B). The effect of Rab14 depletion was specific for HIV-1 Env, as it had no effect on pseudotyping of HIV particles with VSV-G or amphotropic MLV Env (Fig. S6B). To further examine the specificity of the Rab14-FIP1C interaction in mediating HIV Env incorporation, we utilized the interaction domain mapping data outlined above, and asked if FIP1C(S580N/S582L), which does not interact with Rab14, could rescue Env incorporation in FIP1C-depleted HeLa cells. Strikingly, shRNA-resistant wildtype FIP1C rescued Env incorporation as before, while the 580/582 double mutant was unable to rescue Env onto particles (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 5 and 6). This indicates that Rab14 interaction is required for rescue of Env particle incorporation. We then introduced mutations in the Rab11 binding domain that have been shown to eliminate Rab11a binding and disrupt membrane association (FIP1C(I621E)) or that eliminate Rab4 interactions without disrupting membrane interactions (FIP1C(D622N)) [28], placing these both in the context of the shRNA-resistant FIP1C construct. When compared head-to-head, FIP1C(I621E) was not able to rescue Env particle incorporation (Fig. 6C, lane 7) while FIP1C(D622N) was competent for rescue (Fig. 6C, lane 8). We interpret this to mean that mislocalized I621E does not reach the ERC, and subsequently cannot direct outward sorting of Env. It is unclear whether this means that normally Rab11 binding is required for the initial ERC localization of FIP1C, followed by Rab14-directed outward sorting, or if the mislocalization and lack of rescue of Env incorporation is reflective of other defects elicited by this mutation. The fact that knockdown of Rab11a or Rab11b did not alter Env incorporation (Fig. S2A) suggests the latter interpretation, but further work will be needed to define this. Taken together, our data support a model in which a specific Rab14/FIP1C complex mediates the intracellular trafficking and particle incorporation of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein complex.",

We created a cell line that inducibly overexpressed FIP1C and Rab14Q70L, and repeated the titration of Env expression in the presence of a constant amount of cellular Gag. Remarkably, the expression of FIP1C and Rab14Q70L enhanced Env incorporation by 2\u20133 fold (Fig. 7C). Cell surface levels of Env were also increased upon overexpression of FIP1C and Rab14Q70L as assessed by a surface biotinylation assay (Fig. 7C, bottom). The increase in Env incorporation on particles released from this cell line was quantified by densitometric evaluation of Env/Gag ratios and by determination of Env and Gag particle content by ELISA (Fig. 7D).

            "text": "Retroviral envelope proteins are incorporated onto developing viral particles by a process that remains incompletely understood. Pseudotyping of viruses or virus-like particles (VLPs) with envelope glycoproteins of foreign viruses has revealed both specific and non-specific mechanisms of Env incorporation. HIV-1 can form infectious particles with Env proteins from a wide variety of retroviral subfamilies, including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-, and even spumaretroviruses [30], [31], [32], [33], [34] (reviewed in [35]). This promiscuity for pseudotyping extends to Env glycoproteins from other viral families, including coronaviruses [36], paramyxoviruses [37], filoviruses [38], rhabdoviruses [39], and others. Promiscuity of Env incorporation would argue either for a lack of specificity of Env incorporation, or for a common mechanism that is shared by these diverse viruses for Env delivery and incorporation. In contrast, HIV-1 Env itself is quite selective in its ability to pseudotype other retrovirus particles. HIV-1 Env with a full length CT is unable to pseudotype MLV vectors, although truncation of Env CT allows MLV pseudotyping [40]. HIV-1 mutants with point mutations in MA fail to incorporate full-length HIV-1 Env, while truncation of CT allows Env incorporation [41], [42]. Although direct interactions between Env CT and MA have been reported in vitro for HIV and SIV [43], [44], a direct interaction has been difficult to substantiate in cell-based assays. Thus there is selectivity and specificity of particle incorporation that is conferred by the full length HIV-1 Env CT, while the mechanism has not yet been fully explained. The specificity of HIV-1 Env incorporation could be due to direct interactions with MA, to indirect Gag-Env interactions mediated by an intermediate host protein, or could be explained by cotrafficking to a common site of assembly as outlined by Jorgenson and colleagues [45]. Our data support a requirement for specific outward Env trafficking from the ERC mediated by FIP1C and Rab14.",

            "text": "We identified FIP1C and its binding partner Rab14 as essential components determining the incorporation of full-length but not truncated Env onto HIV-1 particles. Rab11-FIP1 was first identified in 2001 through a yeast 2-hybrid screen employing dominant active Rab11a as bait [24]. Rab11a and Rab11-FIPs localize to the endosomal recycling complex and to the apical recycling endosome in polarized cells, where they regulate sorting and plasma membrane recycling [25], [26]. There are five members of this family that have been divided into two classes based upon the presence of specific motifs including C2 domains (class 1 members FIP1B, FIP1C, FIP2, and Rip11/FIP5) and EF hands (class 2 members FIP3 and FIP4) [25], [51]. All family members possess a carboxyl-terminal alpha-helical Rab11-binding domain (RBD). The RBD of the FIPs forms a parallel coiled-coil homodimer that interacts with switch 1 and switch 2 regions of the GTP-bound form of Rab11a, resulting in a heterotetrameric complex of two FIPs and two Rab proteins [52], [53], [54], [55]. While a previous investigation has suggested that the class I FIPs are capable of forming complexes with the Rab14 GTPase [27], our findings suggest that Rab14 interacts specifically with FIP1C through a region separable from the Rab11 binding domain. These results indicate that FIP1C has multiple binding domains for small GTPases, as previously demonstrated for Rabaptin-5 (Rab5 and Rab4) and FIP3 (Arf6 and Rab11) [29], [56]. Our studies demonstrate the discrete point mutations in FIP1C proximal to the RBD can disrupt Rab14 binding without affecting Rab11a association. Similarly, we could not demonstrate any association between Rab14 and FIP2 or FIP5 in either split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assays or in immunofluorescence studies. The difference between our studies and those of Kelly, et al. (2010) could be due to differences in the cell systems examined, but it seems more likely that the discrepancy stems from the antibodies used to detect Rab14. The Aviva Rab14 antibody we have used here has no cross reactivity with either Rab11a or Rab7. In contrast, we have found that the antibody used by Kelly, et al. [27] has prominent cross-reactivity with recombinant Rab11a and Rab7 (data not shown). In any case, the fact that the S580N/S582L FIP1C dual mutant was unable to rescue Env particle incorporation confirms that it is the Rab14/FIP1C interaction rather than the interaction of Rab11a with FIP1C that defines the trafficking complex for HIV Env. In support of this, we found that the GTP-bound form of Rab14(Q70L) actually enhanced the amount of particle-associated Env, while dominant-negative Rab14(S25N) diminished Env incorporation in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar experiments with dominant-negative and constitutively-active Rab11a did not demonstrate this effect. In fact, the constitutively-active Rab11a(S20V) construct diminished Env incorporation, perhaps through competition for FIP1C binding. Together, our results support a complex of GTP-bound Rab14 and FIP1C as essential components mediating the transport of HIV-1 Env to the particle assembly site.",

            "text": "Our data support a model of directed outward trafficking of HIV-1 Env to a plasma membrane microdomain for specific incorporation onto the lipid envelope of budding virions. We suggest that FIP1C and Rab14 are required for this directed trafficking from the ERC to the site of particle assembly and budding, as depicted in Fig. 8. This model predicts that cellular levels of specific trafficking factors may limit the number of Env trimers incorporated onto particles. In support of this idea, we were able to modestly increase the amount of Env on HIV particles by overexpression of constitutively-active Rab14. We propose that the delivery of Env trimers to the cell surface is required but not sufficient for particle incorporation for wildtype viruses bearing intact CTs. Truncated Env constructs such as CT144 reach the cell surface of permissive cells and may be acquired passively, explaining the lack of saturation of truncated Env shown in Fig. 1 of this report. However, T cells are not permissive for incorporation of truncated Env [23]. Therefore the nature of the assembly microdomain in which assembly occurs may differ between cell types such as HeLa cells and H9 cells, with exclusion of truncated Env from this microdomain in H9 cells and lack of exclusion in HeLa. Active trafficking of full length Env, directed by Rab14 and FIP1C, is required for Env delivery and particle incorporation in both cell types. The tail dependence of this phenotype predicts that specific motifs in the CT will be engaged with a FIP1C/Rab14 complex in the outward trafficking of Env. Future work will focus on the identification of these motifs and the interacting domains within FIP1C. We note that there are numerous polymorphisms in FIP1C alleles reported in the NCBI database, some of which could be damaging to its function. It will be important in future studies to examine the potential effect of polymorphisms in FIP1C on HIV acquisition or disease progression.",
