            "text": "The conceptual model under which physicians train affects the way they approach patient care. Changing patterns in diseases on a global scale suggest a need for new conceptual models for medical education. Rapid global population growth and mobility, agricultural intensification, and the effects of accelerating climate change are impacting biodiversity and ecosystems challenging planetary boundaries for sustainability and creating new environmental health threats at the community and individual level [1]. Emerging infectious diseases in recent decades, driven in large part by such environmental developments, are mostly zoonotic (transmitted between animals and humans) in origin. Zoonotic disease outbreaks and pandemics including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza, West Nile virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Ebola, are occurring with increasing frequency and threaten global health security and economic stability [2, 3]. There is increasing evidence for the changing relationship with our environment leading to many chronic and emerging challenges such as malnutrition associated with food systems leading to both under- and over nutrition, and diseases relating to declining quality of the environment in particular the air, water, soils and access to space and nature. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are emerging in both humans and animals related to widespread use of antibiotics across species including in animal agriculture [4]. At the same time, studies of physicians reveal limited awareness of the environmental health aspects of medical problems in the patient care setting [5], as well as low levels of awareness about prevention or treatment of zoonotic diseases [6]. Therefore, there have been calls for training health professionals in \u201csystems thinking\u201d to better prepare them to face these emerging disease issues [7].",

In 1980, Engel presented a case of a patient with chest pain to demonstrate how a reductionist \u201cbiomedical\u201d model (that breaks down biological processes into discrete pathways and considers each separately [8] could miss important elements of the social and psychological aspects of care. The \u201cbiopsychosocial\u201d model for medical care that he proposed as an alternative approach to a clinical situation was a systems approach that considers the patient as part of a larger system with hierarchical levels of increasing complexity, from the molecular to the cellular to the organ, individual, community, and society (Fig. 1) [9, 10]. The concepts of patient-centered care and consideration of social determinants of health can be seen as the most recent efforts to incorporate biopsychosocial approaches into the patient-provider encounter [11, 12]. It now seems timely to adapt and update the biopsychosocial model into a \u201cOne Health\u201d framework that applies the same type of systems thinking to disease challenges in a rapidly changing global environment.\n",

Like Engel\u2019s Biopsychosocial model, the One Health model is a systems framework, but one that considers animal and environmental as well as human health systems (Fig. 2). The concept has been endorsed by a number of national and state medical organizations and international agencies including the American Medical Association, the Centers for Disease Control, and the World Health Organization [14]. There have been calls for academic medical institutions to adopt One Health transdisciplinary approaches to research and education [15, 16]. Student One Health interest groups have been formed in a number of medical schools, and some academic health centers have reorganized existing programs and initiated new ones around One Health principles [17].\n",

Taking a pet history is feasible in the primary care setting [27] and in the hospital can be incorporated into either the nursing or medical history taking process. If the clinician caring for Mr. Glover in the Emergency Department could take such an animal contact history, it would reveal that he is anxious because his dog, considered an important member of the family, has been left alone at home. The patient is concerned because the weather report has announced a heat illness alert due to an ongoing heat wave, and the air conditioning in the house is not working (this may also be contributing to the patient\u2019s lack of adequate sleep). The dog had been lame for several months and has limited mobility. When Mr. Glover had developed chest pain at work, the chief reason for his reluctance to go to the emergency room, he would now disclose to the clinician, was his concern about leaving his dog alone in the house during the heat advisory expected later in the day.",

For example, pets, may suffer the effects of heat stress before humans, due in part to due to their inability to sweat effectively [31], and to escape a heat-exposed environment [32]. Similarly, abuse diagnosed in a pet may be a warning sign of the risk of domestic violence to humans in the same household [33].

Initial attempts to introduce One Health into medical education must recognize and address such constraints. An initial step is to incorporate an introduction to One Health principles in the teaching of zoonotic diseases during infectious disease coursework early in medical school. Educators can demonstrate how One Health approaches can lead to better detection and treatment of such diseases, (some of which will appear on the board examinations). Another preliminary step is to incorporate better animal contact histories into the teaching of clinical interviewing, including the use of standardized patients and recommended history checklists.
