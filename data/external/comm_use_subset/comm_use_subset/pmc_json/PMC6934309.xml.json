However, many of the commercially available tests have focused on the detection of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and have been used in point-of-care facilities, limiting the number of samples that can be analyzed simultaneously. Therefore, there is a need for rapid, fully automated commercial techniques that allow detection of a broad panel of respiratory viruses, can be adapted to variable sample sizes and would enable the application of diagnostic algorithms [12] to consider parameters such as patient characteristics (immunosuppression, basal respiratory diseases) and seasonality of the viruses. Among the commercial systems currently available, Allplex\u2122 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) offers simultaneous detection of 18 viral targets, including all respiratory virus of medical importance, and also provides epidemiological information, as it detects influenza A subtypes, RSV and parainfluenza virus types, as well as the identification of 3 of the 4 coronaviruses (229E, NL63 and OC43) that produce respiratory infection in humans. This assay allows the differentiated detection of enterovirus and picornavirus, a singular feature among commercial platforms that perform syndromic diagnosis of viral respiratory infection. These characteristics made it the routine method implemented in our laboratory starting in the 2016\u20132017 flu season. Allplex applies its own technology (multiple detection temperature, MuDT\u2122) that allows the simultaneous amplification of multiple targets at the same wavelength without melt curve analysis.",
