Current standard therapy is based on a combination of pegylated (PEG)-IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin (RBV) and treatment response may be influenced by several virus-related factors such as HCV genotype and baseline titer of HCV RNA [2], [3]. A sustained virological response (SVR) occurs in approximately 80% of patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3, and in approximately 45% for genotypes 1 or 4 [4]. New antiviral strategies are currently in development for HCV infection and include drugs targeting key viral enzymes such as NS3-4A and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [5]. Although effective, the use of these new antivirals seems associated to the selection of drug-resistant HCV variants, resulting in viral breakthrough. Thus, a combination between antivirals and standard treatment with IFN-\u03b1 and RBV is therefore necessary [3], [6].",

Activated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T lymphocytes were found able to inhibit subgenomic HCV replication, and this effect was mediated mainly by IFN-\u03b3 release [21]. A role of recombinant IFN-\u03b3 on subgenomic HCV replication was also described [22]. Moreover, several studies showed that the combination of recombinant IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1 resulted in a strongly enhanced antiviral activity in the HCV replicon model, opening the way to new combined treatment approaches. Thus, IFN-\u03b3 induced by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell stimulation could enhance standard treatment effectiveness.",

To this aim, IFN-\u03b3 production (Figure 4) after 24 hours of single PhAg (3 \u00b5M), single IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/ml), or combined (PhAg/IFN\u03b1) in vitro stimulations was evaluated on PBMC from 24 HCV-infected patients and 35 HD. Figure 4 shows that IFN-\u03b1 was able to increase IFN-\u03b3 production by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells after PhAg stimulation both in HD [HD: PhAg: median 77.1 (IQR: 69.5\u2013158.1) vs. PhAg/IFN\u03b1: 147.9 (119.9\u2013221.6), p = 0.004, Figure 4A] and in HCV-infected patients [HCV: PhAg: median 4.4 (IQR: 0.0\u201314.9) vs. PhAg/IFN\u03b1: 21.8 (5.6\u201347.4), p<0.0001, Figure 4B]. Notably, in HCV-infected patients, IFN-\u03b3 production by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells after PhAg/IFN-\u03b1 stimulation did not reach the level found in HD. Nevertheless, the relative impact of IFN-\u03b1 in improving individual V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell responsiveness was higher in HCV-infected patients than in HD (Figure 4C).",

Specifically, antiviral role of activated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells, mainly mediated by IFN-\u03b3 release, has been demonstrated for several viruses such as coronavirus [25], orthopoxvirus [26], HIV [27], and HCV [21]. In our work, a severe functional inability of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 was shown in HCV patients, independently from viral load and genotype. Other innate immune cells are known to show quantitative and qualitative defects during chronic HCV infection such as DC [28] and NK cells [8]\u2013[10], that could be associated to adaptive immune response dysfunction and/or exhaustion [28]. In this context, a complex network of different signals can act to induce immune cell exhaustion, such as chronic inflammation, persistent antigen stimulation, and/or direct viral effects [29]. Chronic inflammation and persistent antigen stimulation, as observed during HIV infection, may result in V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell exhaustion and anergy through activation-induced cell death [30], or through a decrease in V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells response by down-modulating CD3-\u03be chain expression [31]. Finally, although controversial [32], [33], a possible direct HCV-driven inhibition of NK cell function through HCV-E2/CD81 binding has been reported [34]. Interestingly, CD81 expression by \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells was previously reported [35]. A study aimed to define cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells exhaustion during chronic HCV infection may be useful to evaluate possible strategies to restore their activity.",

A first demonstration that type-I IFN may be sensed by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells was reported by Kunzmann et al., showing an increase of CD69 after IFN-\u03b1 treatment [36]. We confirmed this observation (data not shown) and showed the ability of IFN-\u03b1 to increase V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell response to PhAgs stimulation in terms of IFN-\u03b3 production both in HD and in HCV-infected patients. In particular, the significant impairment of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells in HCV-infected patients did not allow to obtain their complete restoration by IFN-\u03b1. Nevertheless, individual relative impact of PhAg/IFN-\u03b1 co-stimulation was found much higher in HCV patients, due to the very low level of responsiveness to PhAgs. Thus, the possibility to restore IFN-\u03b3 production in vivo by combining standard IFN-\u03b1 treatment and PhAg stimulation may have a positive impact on HCV inhibition. Indeed several reports show that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 may synergistically inhibit HCV replication in vitro\n[22], [37], [38] and this effect is also reported for other viruses [39]. Nevertheless, a study aimed to evaluate the antiviral impact of PhAg/IFN-\u03b1 combination is ongoing and may validate new combined treatment strategies. Interestingly, PhAg-activated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells are able not only to produce IFN-\u03b3 but also to deploy many different response pathways, such as DC activation [17], and neutrophils recruitment/activation [18], thus improving the overall protective immune response capability. Noteworthy, IFN-\u03b1 effect on PhAg/response was found also in vivo in pre-clinical trials on non-human primates, inducing an increase in IFN-\u03b3 amount in animals sera. A time-course study of in vivo IFN-\u03b1 treatment on V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell responsiveness to PhAg in HCV-infected patients is currently in progress.",

Similar observations were reported on NK cells, as IFN-\u03b3 production after IL-12 and IL-18 stimulation was regulated by mechanisms involving IFN-\u03b3-mRNA stabilization [40]. Indeed, mRNA stabilization is now considered as one of the main post-transcriptional control mechanisms responsible for the initiation and resolution of inflammation [41].",

            "text": "In recent years, a new attention on new direct antiviral drugs for chronic HCV infection is growing. Nevertheless, a combination of these new treatments with IFN-\u03b1/Ribavirin seem necessary to avoid the emergence of drug resistance [6], [42]. The definition of other combined immunomodulating approaches may contribute to optimize the antiviral response. In this context V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cells may represent a good target of immunomodulating strategies for their ability to be easily activated in vivo by PhAgs [12], [43]\u2013[45] without HLA restriction [46] and to orchestrate a complex network of antiviral and immunomodulating activities [17]\u2013[19]. We show here for the first time that IFN-\u03b1, currently used in standard therapy, is able to improve V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell responsiveness in HCV patients. This, and the finding that IFN-\u03b3 can act synergistically with IFN-\u03b1 to inhibit HCV replication [22], [37], [38], strengthen the rational for testing combined standard antiviral and immunostimulating therapeutical strategies. To this aim, future in vivo studies on HCV-infected non-human primates aimed to define the antiviral capability of the combined treatment are necessary both to assess safety and antiviral effectiveness of this combined approach, and to disclose the cellular/molecular mechanisms involved.",
