Furthermore, in 2000 to 2001, a large outbreak of meningococcal disease resulted in at least 47 deaths, including 11 deaths in the United Kingdom, and affected no fewer than 2400 people in several countries throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America.

Despite this, unauthorized domestic pilgrims often sometimes enter Hajj sites without a permit and without formally registering with an official Hajj tour group. Additionally, despite being enforced and freely offered, the vaccine coverage was found to be very low (64%) in 2006 in the only published work reporting vaccine uptake among domestic pilgrims [12]. The rate was also unsatisfactory among domestic HCWs (ranging from 51.7% to 84.7%) in several studies conducted between 2009 and 2018 [17,18,19,20]. In recent years, the enforcement of the Hajj permit requirement by rigorous procedures at points of entry into Makkah reduced the number and proportion of domestic pilgrims (from 1.4 million (45%) in 2012 to 600,000 (26%) in 2018) [21]. However, there is no recent study assessing the uptake of meningococcal vaccines among these pilgrims. To this end, a survey was undertaken to evaluate the coverage of MenACWY vaccines among Hajj pilgrims and to identify the key predictors and barriers affecting their uptake, particularly among domestic pilgrims, which was not assessed in previous studies.

It also evaluated if this was the participant\u2019s first time to the Hajj, whether the vaccine was freely offered, and the receipt of pre-Hajj health advice. The survey was primarily in English, with Arabic translations available for those who preferred to complete the survey in Arabic.

Although the vaccine uptake identified in this survey (85%) is higher than that reported by El Bashir et al. during the Hajj in 2006 (64% among domestic pilgrims who attended the National Guard Clinics in Makkah [12]), it appears that the official regulation that mandates meningococcal vaccination as a prerequisite for a Hajj permit for locals is less effective than that applied to international pilgrims, and a significant number of domestic pilgrims are able to avoid vaccination. Ensuring no Hajj permit is granted unless a valid certificate is provided may improve the situation; however, it is possible that there are more prevailing factors involved, including education of the general population, as well as HCWs.

The majority of overseas pilgrims received \u201cprofessional\u201d pre-Hajj health advice, while locals tended to rely on \u201csocial\u201d sources. However, receiving any pre-travel health advice, being employed, and having a tertiary qualification were each individually associated with greater compliance with the vaccination policy. Previous reports on uptake of other recommended vaccines at Hajj also indicated that receiving pre-travel health advice was a considerable motivator for receiving vaccinations against other diseases [14,23]. Furthermore, in a large survey among residents of Gulf Cooperation Council countries, doctors\u2019 advice was the leading motivator for receipt of influenza vaccine [24]. Worksite immunization was shown to be effective in facilitating influenza vaccine uptake in Saudi Arabia [25]. Similarly, some employed participants of this survey indicated receiving the meningococcal vaccine at or through their workplace. This may explain the higher vaccine uptake among employed participants compared with those who identified themselves as unemployed. Additionally, more educated pilgrims were more likely to receive the meningococcal vaccine than those with lower educational attainment. A cross-sectional study of Australian Hajj pilgrims also demonstrated that having a university education was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving recommended Hajj vaccines (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.7\u20136.7, p = 0.01) [14]. Previous reports also described a higher rate of vaccine uptake in women preparing to be pilgrims [20,26,27]. The association observed in this survey was in the same direction, but the difference with men was not statistically significant, which may be due to the low proportion of women who participated in the survey.",

Meningococcal serogroups that are not covered by the current quadrivalent vaccine were frequently isolated from throat swabs collected from pilgrims, namely, serogroups B and, less frequently, X [31,32,33]. A recent systematic review concluded that serogroup B dominated the carriage acquisition among Hajj pilgrims [32], and most carriers received the polysaccharide vaccine, which is not expected to reduce the carriage acquisition of serogroups contained in the vaccine [34,35]. The opportunity to prevent future outbreaks depends on an ongoing review of the current mandatory vaccination policy in view of these and future developments.",

However, since pilgrims are often too busy to complete forms, the small sample size and the submission of incomplete responses are key limitations of this survey. Additionally, the small number of unvaccinated participants limits the ability to draw reliable conclusions regarding the true role of specific barriers. Furthermore, the data are self-reported, and we had no way of validating vaccination histories; moreover, the questionnaire did not differentiate between conjugate and polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines. Finally, we considered all those who stated previous receipt of the vaccine as vaccinated; however, since some respondents did not state the year of vaccination, the true uptake rates may be lower than reported here. The inability to include \u201cunauthorized\u201d domestic pilgrims also adds to the potential overestimation of the true vaccine uptake rate among domestic pilgrims.",

Overseas pilgrims appear to have good uptake of the vaccine, as expected from the mandatory vaccination for visa policy. Receipt of pre-travel health advice, regardless of the source, is a key motivator for vaccine uptake, and lack of awareness about the vaccination policy is an important barrier. Improving vaccine uptake likely requires system-wide strategies, such as reducing financial barriers and increasing the availability of vaccination centers, as well as greater education of the public, particularly targeting those who are intending to perform Hajj, regarding Hajj-related health risks and prevention strategies. Strategies to improve the ability of local HCW to proactively provide preventive pre-Hajj health advice are also needed. Additionally, the success of the mandatory vaccination policy that is applied to international pilgrims should be modeled to improve compliance with the domestic policy through more rigorous checks and measures. Ongoing evaluation of such strategies is required to monitor the true uptake of vaccines and other health-promoting behaviors among domestic (and international) pilgrims, so that appropriate public health responses can be made to evolving situations.",
