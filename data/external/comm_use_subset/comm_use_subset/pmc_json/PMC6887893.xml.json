            "text": "Influenza is an acute infectious disease caused by influenza virus infection, which is primarily characterized by respiratory damage. Moreover, it is associated with serious features (e.g., acute onset, wide spread, strong contagiousness, and great harm), which seriously threatens human health. Studies have shown that a series of symptoms and consequences caused by the influenza virus are not caused by the direct action of the influenza virus itself but are rather due to the inflammatory injury caused by the excessive activation of the immune response induced by an influenza virus infection (Oda et al., 1989; Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Basler and Aguilar, 2008; Li and Cao, 2017). During the process of an IAV infection, there are different cytokine waves from the initial early responses of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interferon-alpha/beta/kappa (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03ba) to the later responses of IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IFN type I, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha/beta (MIP-1\u03b1/\u03b2), MIP-3\u03b1, MCP-3, and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), which are mainly secreted by infected macrophages in the lower respiratory tract (Julkunen et al., 2001; Xagorari and Chlichlia, 2008; Jewell et al., 2010; Gu et al., 2019). The modest cytokine response contributes to the induction of antiviral and Th1-type immune responses in the body; however, excessive inflammatory responses can be harmful. For example, the main reason for the high pathogenicity of the H5N1 avian influenza virus is the exaggerated generation and secretion of excessively high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, known as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d (Kobasa et al., 2007; Allen et al., 2009). In 1918, the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d also caused fatal inflammatory damage to the lung tissue by triggering an overreaction of the human immune response (Ocana-Macchi et al., 2009). This inflammatory injury to the lung tissue is both an important cause of death due to influenza virus infection and a major cause of lung infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), sepsis, and aspiration pneumonia (Imai et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005). Currently, immunosuppressive agents (e.g., glucocorticoids) are often used in clinical practice to inhibit inflammatory cytokine responses, thereby blocking disease progression and improving the clinical therapeutic effect. The literature reports that 51\u201369% of patients with severe H1N1 influenza are treated with glucocorticoids, which have a specific therapeutic effect (Aikawa et al., 2012); however, glucocorticoids systemically inhibit the immune function of the infected individual. Moreover, the long-term treatment with such medication can induce or aggravate the infection, causing a variety of complications and serious side effects (e.g., femoral head necrosis). Therefore, it is imperative to develop a deep understanding of the pathogenesis of influenza virus and to identify new strategies of treating influenza more safely and effectively.",

This family plays an extremely important role in the process of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Stewart and Rotwein, 1996; Granata et al., 2004). IGF1 mainly functions by binding to IGF1R, a transmembrane protein composed of two \u03b1 domains and two \u03b2 domains (Siddle et al., 2001). The \u03b1 domain binds to IGF1 to activate the \u03b2 domain (Siddle et al., 2001). Since the \u03b2 domain has tyrosine kinase activity, it can promote the phosphorylation of the substrate hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), docking protein insulin receptor substrate (IRS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2; Wilden et al., 1992; Hubbard, 1997). Some phosphorylated substrates activate the downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways to regulate a range of biological responses (Myers et al., 1992; Egan et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Recent studies have found that IGF1 plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation in the immune system. IGF1 mRNA expression in the bronchial cells of asthmatic patients was significantly higher than that of normal people and was significantly associated with fibrosis in epithelial cells (Hoshino et al., 1998). The associated mechanism is that IGF1 binds to the receptor and activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induces Akt activation, which further activates the downstream IL-17-mediated inflammatory pathway (Lee et al., 2014). In addition, the levels of serum IGF1 protein in patients with type 2 diabetes are significantly higher than those in healthy people. Obesity is closely related to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, as long-term obesity will lead to IL-6 and IL-17-mediated chronic inflammation (Cohen and LeRoith, 2012; Ge et al., 2013). In non-autoimmune inflammatory contact dermatitis, IGF1 relieves the inflammatory response by recruiting regulatory T cells to release the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (Johannesson et al., 2014). In the nervous system, IGF1 recruits anti-inflammatory proteins to protect nerve cells from degeneration (Arroba et al., 2016). Other studies have shown that IGF1 plays an important role in regulating the function of lactating buffalo oocytes and preventing inflammation induced by post-partum genital tract infections. A concentration of 50 ng/ml IGF1 acts on lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 1 \u03bcg/ml)-infected buffalo granulosa cells, reducing the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2, as well as decreasing Akt phosphorylation in PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in the MAPK signaling pathway (Onnureddy et al., 2015).",

In this study, we found that IGF1 mRNA and protein increased after influenza virus infection. Overexpression of IGF1 aggravated cytokine expression during infection by influenza, while blocking of IGF1 production in mice treated with IGF1R inhibitor, decreased immunopathology. The phosphorylation level of IGF1R was elevated after influenza virus infection, triggering the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways to induce an inflammatory response. Thus, IGF1 could regulate influenza virus-mediated acute inflammatory lung injury, which may provide a therapeutic target for humans in response to an influenza outbreak.",

The results in Figure 2C showed that compared with the Mock controls, the cytokine levels were significantly increased following PR8 infection in control cells (PR8 + pcDNA3.1-con group and PR8 + Lenti + con group). IGF1 overexpression further increased the level of cytokine mRNA expression, whereas the levels of cytokine expression in the PR8-infected cells with IGF1 knocked down (PR8 + Lenti + shIGF1) were significantly decreased far lower than the PR8-infected control cell (PR8 + Lenti + con group), as well as the uninfected Mock group. Especially the lowest CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA of PR8 + Lenti + shIGF1 group were downregulated to less than half that of the Mock group.

The PBS group was intranasally inoculated with 30 \u03bcl PBS, whereas the other three groups were intranasally inoculated with 30 \u03bcl influenza virus PR8 (50LD50). From 6 h before the inoculation to day 14 post-infection, the mice in the PR8 + IGF1 group were intraperitoneally injected with IGF1 protein (20 \u03bcg/kg/24 h); PR8 + PPP mice were injected intraperitoneally with an IGF1 receptor inhibitor, picropodophyllin (PPP, 20 mg/kg/12 h); and the PR8 + PBS group was injected with PBS (30 \u03bcl/24 h). The clinical symptoms of the mice were observed daily for 14 days, and changes in body weight and survival were recorded. Six mice of each group were sacrificed at day 5 post infection of PR8, and the serum and lung tissues of each group were collected and mixed. The extent of lung injury and inflammatory cell infiltration of the mice in each group was observed by histologically. Changes in the level of serum cytokines were detected by ELISA. A western blot was used to detect the changes in the expression of major proteins in the IGF1/IGF1R-related signaling pathways.",

The symptoms of the PR8 + IGF1 group were more severe than those of the PR8 + PBS group, whereas the PR8 + PPP group displayed milder clinical symptoms than that of the PR8 + PBS group (Figure 4A). Figure 4B showed that the body weight of the mice decreased significantly on day 3 post-infection of PR8, and the body weight of the mice on day 9 decreased to the lowest. Although the changes in body weight were similar between the PR8 + PPP group and PR8 + PBS group, the survival rate of the PR8 + PPP group was dramatically increased up to 75% compared with the survival rate of the PR8 + PBS group was only 25%, with the first death not occurring until the day 8 post-infection (Figure 4C). The first death in the PR8 + IGF1 group was accelerated to day 5 post-infection, and all mice have succumbed to the infection by day 8. These findings indicated that the intraperitoneal injection of IGF1 promoted the death of PR8-infected mice, whereas the inhibition of IGF1 increased the survival rate of PR8-infected mice.",

Figure 7A showed that the phosphorylation level of IGF1R increased gradually following PR8 infection, peaked at day 7 post-infection, and then decreased slightly on day 9, which was consistent with the changes in the trend of IGF1 protein expression (Figure 3B). Figures 7B\u2013D showed that the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways were activated following PR8 infection; p-AKT expression was upregulated in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; and p-p38 and p-JNK expression were upregulated in the MAPK signaling pathway. The levels of p-AKT and p-p38 expression were further increased in the PR8 + IGF1 group. The expression level in the PR8 + PPP group was between that of the PBS and PR8 + PBS groups. There was no significant difference in the level of p-JNK expression between the groups infected with influenza virus. The results indicated that the administration of IGF1 protein following influenza virus infection promoted the activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathway.

First, the host\u2019s innate immune system, consisting of interferon, cytokines, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, and Dendritic cells (DCs), all rapidly respond to the viral infection and activate adaptive immunity (Gu et al., 2019). Although the innate immune response is important, the host typically eliminates the viral infection with the aid of the adaptive response (Bonilla and Oettgen, 2010). In humoral immunity, neutralizing antibodies can prevent the adsorption of the virus, via opsonization, and primarily interact with extracellular free viruses (Murasko et al., 2002). Activated Th1 cells release various cytokines (i.e., IFN-\u03b3 and TNF), activate macrophages and NK cells to induce further inflammatory reactions, and promote the proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which play an important role in antiviral infection (Julkunen et al., 2001; Farsakoglu et al., 2019). However, studies have shown that while an inflammatory response helps to clear pathogens, excessive inflammatory reactions do not only protect the host organism but also cause the additional damage. Many studies have shown that the cause of death from an influenza virus infection is the pulmonary respiratory syndrome induced by inflammation caused by an excessive reaction of the body\u2019s immune system (Blach-Olszewska and Leszek, 2007).",

The results showed that IGF1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly altered following IAV infection. To further confirm the important role of IGF1 in IAV-mediated inflammation and the associated signaling mechanism, IGF1 protein was administered as an intervention to PR8-infected mice. Compared with the untreated infected mice, the infected mice administered IGF1 displayed more severe clinical symptoms; in particular, the serum levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly increased, and lung damage was more serious. IGF1 is known to function by binding to the receptor, IGF1R. In this study, the IGF1R inhibitor PPP was used to inhibit IGF1R function, thereby disrupting its downstream signaling capacity. By monitoring the clinical symptoms and inflammation indicators in mice, it was found that during the same period of viral infection, when PPP was used to inhibit IGF1, the clinical symptoms of mice were alleviated; the lung injury area of the mice was reduced; the degree of lung injury was reduced; the lung index was significantly decreased; the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were significantly decreased; and the survival rate increased from 25 to 75% compared with the untreated group. The viral proliferation in the lungs of mice treated with IGF1 was significantly increased; however, the viral proliferation of the mice treated with PPP was similar to that of the PR8 + PBS group. Thus, the inhibition of IGF1 only affects the immune response but has no significant effect on IAV replication. Thus, the inhibition of IGF1, rather than antiviral pathways that affect viral replication, may provide a new therapeutic avenue for influenza that limits detrimental inflammatory responses to infection. This is consistent with the previously reported effective treatments for influenza-mediated inflammation, which prolong the survival of older influenza-infected individuals, compared to those treated with antivirals (Pillai et al., 2016).",

Although IGF1 primarily regulates cell growth and apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, whether IGF1 plays a role in these pathways in the context of influenza virus-mediated inflammation remains unknown. In this study, a Western blot was used to detect the expression of key proteins in the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. The results showed that p-IGF1R was upregulated following PR8 infection; p-AKT expression was upregulated in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; and p-p38 and p-JNK expression were upregulated in the MAPK signaling pathway compared with the PBS group. The expression of p-AKT and p-p38 in the PR8 + IGF1 group was higher than that of the PR8 + PBS group, and the expression in the PR8 + PPP group was between that of the PBS and PR8 + PBS group. There was no significant difference in the level of p-JNK expression between the groups infected with influenza virus. This suggested that IGF1 affected the expression of key proteins associated with P38 in the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in the context of influenza virus-mediated inflammation, which confirmed our hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that IGF1 expression is upregulated following influenza virus infection, and IGF1 receptor phosphorylation is elevated, triggering two signaling pathways downstream of PI3K/AKT and MAPK to induce inflammation. Thus, the inhibition of IGF1 or IGF1R expression to block such downstream signaling pathways may represent a novel approach for the treatment of influenza virus infection.",
