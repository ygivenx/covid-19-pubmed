            "text": "\nEquine arteritis virus (EAV) is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis, a respiratory and reproductive disease of horses [1, 2]. EAV is a small enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~12.7 kb. It belongs to the family Arteriviridae (genus Arterivirus, order Nidovirales), which also includes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice [3\u20135]. The EAV genome includes at least ten known functional open reading frames (ORFs 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6, and 7) [5\u20137]. ORFs 1a and 1b are located at the 5\u2032-proximal three-quarters of the genome and are translated to produce replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (1,727 and 3,175 amino acids, resp.). Translation of ORF1b depends on a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift located just before termination of ORF1a translation [8]. The two replicase precursor polyproteins are cleaved by three ORF1a-encoded proteases that reside in nsp1, nsp2, and nsp4, yielding at least 13 end-products, namely, nonstructural proteins (nsps) 1 to 12, including a recently described nsp7\u03b1 and 7\u03b2 [5, 9, 10]. The remaining eight ORFs (2a, 2b, and 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6-7) are located in the 3\u2032 quarter of the genome and encode the structural proteins (E, GP2, GP3, GP4, ORF5a protein, GP5, M, and N, resp.) of the virus [5, 6, 11\u201313].",

            "text": "Type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) is a key component of the host innate immune response to viral infection [14]. Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by intracellular receptors, such as retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated antigen 5 (MDA-5) [15], activates protein signaling cascades that result in the activation of transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) [14]. The IFN-\u03b2 promoter contains positive regulatory domains (PRDs), including the binding sites for different transcription factors, IRF-3 (PRDs I and III) and NF-\u03baB (PRD II). Activation of these transcription factors triggers the formation of enhanceosomes in the cell nucleus and induces the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 [14, 16]. Both IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB activation are mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which functions downstream of RIG-I and MDA-5 and upstream of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex and TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) [17\u201320]. Among the various factors involved in type I IFN production, IRF-3 plays a critical role. IRF-3 is expressed in most cell types and resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. When stimulated, IRF-3 becomes phosphorylated and undergoes conformational changes, resulting in dimerization with the exposure of nuclear localization signal. In the nucleus, IRF-3 recruits coactivator CBP/p300 and forms a complex to bind IRF-3 responsive elements (PRDs I and III) of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [14]. In addition to IRF-3, NF-\u03baB is also a critical regulator of host innate and adaptive immunity. It plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation as well as cell survival. Many viruses have evolved strategies to counteract key elements of the IFN response and prevent development of an antiviral response in the host [14]. Through evolution, viruses can either activate or inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway in order to replicate in host cells. Viruses such as African swine fever virus and influenza A virus block NF-\u03baB activation to counteract the host innate immune response [21, 22]. In contrast, viruses such as hepatitis C virus, reovirus, and herpes simplex virus have developed mechanisms to directly activate NF-\u03baB to support production of progeny viruses and intracellular spreading [23\u201325].",

Recently, van Kasteren et al. [33] reported that the EAV PLP2 has de-ubiquitylation function which suppresses RIG-I to control innate immune signaling in EAV-infected cells [34, 35]. In all these studies, the investigators have used recombinant proteins (e.g., nsp2 protein of EAV) and a specific immune suppression mechanism. However, the effect of the whole virus and involvement of other EAV proteins in the suppression of host cell immune responses are largely unknown. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of EAV involved in host immune suppression, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of EAV on type I IFN production and to further identify the specific viral proteins responsible for the suppression of IFN-\u03b2 activity.",

Equine pulmonary endothelial cells (EECs) were infected with EAV VBS at an m.o.i. of 5 for 8 h, followed by infection with SeV for 3 or 6 hpi. SeV-alone-infected cells were used as positive control for type I IFN induction and mock-infected cells were used as negative control. As shown in Figure 1(a), IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was barely detected in cells infected with EAV alone, whereas SeV infection induced a strong expression, approximately 190\u2013200-fold increase of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression level in comparison to that of mock-infected cells at 3 or 6 hpi. In contrast, SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression, at both 3 and 6 hpi, was significantly suppressed in cells previously infected with EAV. In parallel with the quantitative measurement of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, EAV-induced suppression of IFN production was confirmed by IFN bioassay using VSV-GFP, since VSV is IFN sensitive and presence of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 blocks VSV replication. EECs were either infected with EAV or SeV alone or infected with both EAV and SeV. Mock-infected cells were used as negative control. Subsequently, MDBK cells were incubated with two-fold serial dilutions of virus-inactivated cell culture supernatant and then infected with VSV-GFP. The VSV infectivity was determined by monitoring the level of GFP expression. As shown in Figure 1(b), VSV-GFP replicated well in cell culture supernatant from mock-infected cells, while VSV replication was effectively inhibited in those MDBK cells that were preincubated with supernatant from SeV-infected EECs. No VSV-GFP replication was observed up to a dilution of 1 : 32 of the culture supernatant from SeV-infected cells. In contrast, VSV-GFP replication was not inhibited in MDBK cells that were preincubated with cell culture supernatant from EECs infected with EAV alone. Consistent with quantitative RT-PCR results, SeV-induced type I IFN production was significantly inhibited by EAV exposure since VSV-GFP replication was detected at a lower level compared to that from EECs only infected with SeV. Taken together, the data suggest that EAV has an ability to suppress the induction of IFN in infected cells.",

            "text": "To investigate the role of EAV proteins as potential IFN antagonists, we focused on the nonstructural proteins of EAV. Each of the 12 nsp-encoding regions from the genome of EAV VBS was cloned individually into a mammalian expression vector, pCAGGS [40]. The expression of recombinant proteins in the plasmid DNA transfected cells was verified by immunofluorescence assay (Figure 2(a)). To determine whether these nsps have an effect on IFN-\u03b2 activation, we used an IFN-\u03b2 promoter-luciferase reporter assay. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with individual nsp-expressing plasmid and the luciferase reporter plasmid (p125-Luc) along with a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-SV40) for normalizing purpose of sample expression levels. As a positive control, pCAGGS-NS1 plasmid expressing swine influenza virus NS1 (sw-ns1) gene was used to cotransfect the cells with the reporter plasmid, since sw-ns1 is a known IFN antagonist [52]. At 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with SeV to induce luciferase production. The IFN-\u03b2 promoter-luciferase reporter assay result is presented in Figure 2(b). As we expected, the expression of sw-ns1 significantly inhibited IFN-\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase expression. In contrast, a strong reporter signal was observed in cells transfected with empty pCAGGS plasmid after infection with SeV. IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation by SeV infection was suppressed to various degrees by expression of several EAV nsps, among which nsp1, nsp2, and nsp11 showed strong inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase expression. In particular, nsp1 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect, followed by nsp11 and nsp2. The results suggest that several EAV nsps are capable of suppressing IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation.",

First, we investigated whether the nsp1 was interfering with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) complex activity. Since MDA-5 or RIG-I is associated with the MAVS complex, cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing RIG-I, MDA-5, or MAVS protein, a plasmid expressing EAV nsp1, the plasmid pRL-SV40, and the p55-CIB-Luc reporter plasmid. As shown in Figures 4(a)\u20134(c), IRF-3 promoter-dependent luciferase expression was suppressed in the presence of EAV nsp1. These results suggested that EAV nsp1 might inhibit the MAVS-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction or downstream portion of the signaling pathway. Therefore, we further tested the effect of EAV nsp1 on TRIF- and IKK\u03b5-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction. The results showed that nsp1 had the ability to suppress TBK1- and IKK\u03b5-mediated reporter gene expression (Figures 4(d) and 4(e)). Similarly, overexpression of IRF-3 itself did not activate the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene either (Figure 4(f)).

EAV nsp1 transfected HeLa cells were stimulated with poly(I:C), and subsequently expression of IRF-3 was stained with anti-IRF-3 antibody. In the absence of stimulation, IRF-3 was homogeneously distributed throughout the cell, whereas upon poly(I:C) stimulation IRF-3 was mainly translocated into the nucleus. As shown in Figure 6(a), expression of EAV nsp1 did not block the nuclear translocation of IRF-3. The result suggested that nsp1-mediated suppression of IFN production occurs downstream of the IRF-3 nuclear translocation. Similarly, the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was determined in cells expressing EAV nsp1 by immunofluorescence assay (Figure 6(b)). NF-\u03baB remained largely not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus to some extent in unstimulated cells, whereas TNF-\u03b1 stimulation induced the nuclear translocation of p65. In cells expressing EAV nsp1, TNF-\u03b1 stimulation did not notably change the p65 nuclear translocation, and p65 normally remained in the nucleus, indicating that EAV nsp1 did not block p65 nuclear translocation. These results suggest that, in the NF-\u03ba\u03b2-dependent signaling pathway for IFN-\u03b2 production, the activation of IFN-\u03b2 transcription would be blocked by nsp1 somewhere downstream in the nucleus after NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation occurred.",

            "text": "Synthesis and secretion of type I IFNs, such as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are critical aspects of the antiviral immune response [14, 53, 54]. Viruses use different mechanisms to inhibit interferon response in order to evade the host innate immune response. Many viruses encode more than one protein capable of inhibiting the interferon response, which act synergistically to ensure complete blocking of interferon activity. For example, Ebola, Nipah, and SARS-CoV encode multiple viral proteins capable of inhibiting interferon activity, suggesting important roles for these proteins in pathogenesis and disease outcome [55\u201358]. In this study, we investigated whether EAV has the ability to interfere with the host innate immune response, in particular, type I IFN production. Our results demonstrated that EAV infection in EECs significantly inhibited type I IFN production at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas infection with SeV stimulated a high level of type I IFN production. Furthermore, EAV infection significantly inhibited SeV-induced type I IFN production as well. Based on IFN-\u03b2 promoter-luciferase reporter assay results, three EAV nonstructural proteins, nsp1, nsp2, and nsp11, were identified as potential IFN antagonists. Previous studies reported that EAV nsp2-encoded papain-like proteinase (PLP2) is capable of inhibiting Ub- and ISG15-dependent innate immune responses [34, 35, 59]. The EAV nsp11 encodes NendoU endoribonuclease [60], which is highly cytotoxic upon its in vitro expression. In PRRSV, the homologous nsp11 was proposed to be an IFN antagonist [26, 31, 61]. However, whether this effect is due to the cytosolic version of the enzyme targeting on the overall RNA population of the cell or the specific suppression of IFN production needs to be determined in the future. It could be possible that the three potential immune antagonists of EAV, nsp1, nsp2, and nsp11, target different parts of the host cellular immune system and their synergistic effect during the course of infection could be able to shut down the host cell innate immune response completely. This may explain why the induction of interferon and some immunomodulatory cytokines are inhibited during in vivo EAV infection [62].",

            "text": "Among the three potential IFN antagonists of EAV, expression of nsp1 had the strongest inhibitory effect on IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation. In comparison to our findings, previous studies on PRRSV also demonstrated that the EAV nsp1 homologous, PRRSV nsp1\u03b1/\u03b2 has the strongest ability to inhibit type I IFN synthesis [26, 31, 51, 63\u201367]. Further analysis revealed that EAV nsp1 inhibited two key signaling pathways for IFN-\u03b2 activation, the IRF-3- and NF-\u03baB-dependent signaling pathways. In our study, EAV nsp1 blocked each signaling step upstream of IRF-3 or NF-\u03baB activation, suggesting that EAV nsp1 acts downstream of all those tested steps in both signaling pathways. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis further showed that nsp1 did not have much effect on the nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB. Therefore, we postulated that EAV nsp1 might have an effect on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter inside the nucleus. Previous studies have shown that PRRSV nsp1\u03b1/\u03b2 modulates type I IFN response by blocking dsRNA-induced IRF-3 activation and IFN promoter activities, but IRF-3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation occur normally in the presence of the nsp1\u03b1/\u03b2 [51]. Recent study reported that PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 blocks the IRF-3 activation by degrading the CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding)-binding protein (CBP) and subsequently inhibiting formation of enhanceosomes in the nucleus [51, 63]. EAV nsp1 was reported to be largely nuclear located, similar to PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 [68], suggesting that it may have an effect on the formation of the transcription enhanceosome on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter inside the nucleus. However, PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 does not degrade CBP or interrupt the formation of enhanceosome [68]. Thus, EAV nsp1 may have a unique function in modulating the IFN production in the nucleus. The EAV nsp1 does not contain the traditional nuclear localization signal [68], which suggests that nsp1 might be bound with cellular protein(s) and shuttled into the nucleus. Further studies are required to map the exact point(s) on the IFN induction pathway at which EAV nsp1 acts. It will be interesting to determine the requirement for nuclear localization of the EAV nsp1 that relates to its interferon antagonist function.",

Our data indicate that several EAV replicase proteins, including nsp1, nsp2, and nsp11, possess IFN antagonistic activity and may have potential roles in the regulation of host innate immune responses. Among these proteins, nsp1 may play a key role as IFN antagonist. Further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms that EAV proteins are involved in counteracting the host innate immune response.",
