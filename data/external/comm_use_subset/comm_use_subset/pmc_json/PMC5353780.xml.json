However, influenza vaccines must be reformulated each year due to the constant antigenic evolution of influenza. Additionally, NA inhibitors and M2 ion-channel inhibitors have limited efficacies as drug resistance occurrence [7, 8], and they only worked at the early phase of virus infection. The inherent property of influenza viruses to mutate, resulting in low efficacy of available drugs, has underscored the necessity of developing alternative strategies to provide protection against pandemic influenza.",

Recent studies were pioneered in host purine metabolic pathway, a conserved process responsible for providing host cells with a ready supply of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for critical cellular processes [9]. Host cells could produce GTP either in de novo pathway or salvage pathway. While in the de novo synthesis of GTP, IMPDH catalyzes the oxidation of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) which is the rate-limiting step. Growing evidences support that inhibition of IMPDH decreases intracellular levels of guanosine nucleotides in DNA or RNA synthesis, thereby indirectly inhibits virus replication which requires host guanine nucleotides as raw materials [10, 11]. As IMPDH inhibitors targeted on host cells, it would be less susceptible for selection of drug-resistant strains.",

Notably, compounds 3d (N30) showed potent activity towards IAV at low micromolar concentrations [12]. In the present study, we developed the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of N30 in vitro, including oseltamivir-resistant strains and amantadine-resistant strains of influenza virus, coxsackie B virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. In addition, we examined the inhibitory rate of the compound against two IAV envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, and investigated its effect on expression and the enzyme activity of IMPDH type II. Our results indicated that N30 is a potential compound with antiviral activities through suppressing the activity of IMPDH type II, these finding also proves that development of anti-influenza drugs directing at IMPDH is warranted.",

Accumulating evidence showed that depression of IMPDH inhibits replication of diverse species of viruses. N30 was synthesized targeting on IMPDH, so we further studied the effect of N30 on the enzyme. The results showed that IMPDH expressions have not been lessened after N30 treatment, even RBV had no inhibition either. On the other hand, the enzymatic reaction rate of IMPDH could be reduced by 38.18% after N30 treatment.

Even if an organism or tissue can produce guanine nucleotides in salvage pathways through several phosphoribosyl transferases [26], the amount of guanine nucleotides can not meet the need for rapidly growing cells or viruses. So, the replication of influenza virus could be inhibited through downregulating guanine nucleotides synthesis by inhibiting the activity of IMPDH.
