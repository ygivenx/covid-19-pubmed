Each of these systems has strengths and weaknesses concerning yield, cost, speed, ease of manipulation and folding and post-translational modifications of the target proteins. E. coli is the simplest and most widely used organism for protein expression due to low cost and ease of use but it has serious limitations for expression of mammalian gene products, particularly glycoproteins [1]. Unmodified yeasts, as eukaryotes, are suitable for the production of proteins that do not require mammalian-type glycosylation [2]. However, cultured animal cells still remain the best system in which to produce mammalian glycoproteins, although they have complex nutritional requirements and are sensitive to viral and bacterial contamination [1].",

Rescue of recombinant SeV [7] and other mononegavirales from cDNA copies of their respective negative single-stranded RNA genomes has been achieved, as well as expression of foreign proteins from the recombinant viruses [8]. However, cDNA cloning and rescue of recombinant paramyxoviruses still entails laborious and time-consuming steps. These difficulties are circumvented in rescuing replication defective minigenomes. These are short negative-stranded RNA molecules in which most of the internal coding sequences of the viral genome have been replaced by a reporter gene (or any other heterologous sequence). Paramyxovirus minigenomes obtained by cDNA cloning can be amplified in transfected cells either expressing a minimal set of complementing viral proteins or superinfected with a wild type homologous helper virus. Although the minigenome can then be amplified in tissue culture, SeV replication is much more efficient in eggs than in cultured cells. Therefore, a SeV minigenome seemed an attractive and versatile vector for the expression of foreign proteins in chicken eggs.",

Both, HRSV F and HMPV F are structural proteins that are synthesized as inactive F0 precursors that need to be cleaved proteolytically before becoming membrane-fusion competent. Whereas HRSV F0 is cleaved twice at sites I and II containing furin recognition sequences [11], HMPV F0 is cleaved only once after a single Arg residue [12]. Both proteins are trimers in which each monomer is made of the two chains (F1 and F2) generated after precursor cleavage. A membrane-anchorless HRSV F protein that lacks the C-terminal 50 amino acids (FTM-), including the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, has been expressed in HEp-2 cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus [9] (rVV). HRSV/FTM- folds into trimers that are seen under the electron microscope as cone-shaped molecules [13]. An analogous rVV expressing an anchorless form of HMPV/F protein has been made (described in Methods).",

Transcription of SVec/HA-M by the T7 polymerase results in a positive polarity RNA that, after ribozyme self-cleavage, contains at both ends SeV sequences required for replication and transcription by the SeV polymerase. Therefore, expression of the HA-M protein can be achieved by transfecting BSR-T7/5 cells [15] (which express constitutively the T7 polymerase) with SVec/HA-M and three other plasmids encoding, also under a T7 promoter, the following set of complementing proteins: i) the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the SeV L gene, ii) the phosphoprotein (P), a cofactor of the viral polymerase and iii) the nucleoprotein (N), a major structural protein that binds tightly to both SeV genome and anti-genome (a replication intermediate of positive polarity), protecting them from RNase degradation.",

Then, BRS-T7/5 cells were transfected with SVec plasmids encoding HA-M, HRSV/FTM- or HMPV/FTM- and the set of support plasmids. Expression of the minigenome-encoded products in transfected cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence of parallel cultures with specific antibodies (Figure 1B). Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were infected with SeV that provided the required viral products for incorporation of the minigenome ribonucleoproteins into virus particles that would be found, together with wild type SeV particles, in the supernatants of transfected/infected BSR-T7/5 cells, constituting now a mixed virus stock; i.e. virus particles harboring minigenomes or full-length genomes.",

Amplification of the SeV minigenome after each passage was evaluated indirectly by Western blot of each recombinant protein. In parallel, multiplication of wild type SeV was evaluated by Western blot of the allantoic fluid with a monoclonal antibody (Mab) specific for the SeV F protein. The amount of allantoic fluid in the Western blots was standardized with an antibody specific for egg albumin (Figure 1C). In general, a major band of the Sendai virus F protein was detected after the first passage in eggs, whereas protein bands of the recombinant proteins were detected only after 2\u20133 passages. A cycling expression pattern was observed thereafter. Maximal levels of HA-M, HRSV/FTM- or HMPV/FTM- proteins in allantoic fluids correlated with low expression levels of SeV F protein and vice versa (Figure 1C). This is likely to reflect the competition between minigenomes and full-length SeV genomes for replication and incorporation into virus particles. Minigenomes being shorter are expected to replicate more rapidly than full-length viral genomes. Consequently, minigenomes should quickly outnumber full-length genomes in the infected cells and in the virus particles produced. However, since minigenome amplification and packaging requires helper virus functions, excess minigenome will result in a decrease in minigenome accumulation in the virus stock.",

In contrast, HRSV/FTM- and HMPV/FTM- were found mainly, in their respective supernatants. The small amount of HRSV/FTM- found in the pellet was probably due to aggregates, generated after complete cleavage of monomers in the protein trimer [11], that may have co-sedimented with SeV particles.",

Considering that one egg yields 5\u201310 ml of allantoic fluid, the amount of FTM- protein produced in one egg is equivalent to that found in the supernatant of rVV-infected cells grown as monolayer in a plastic flask of 175 cm2 (~108 cells). This yield reduces the production cost of FTM- proteins about 10 times, considering only the cost of plastic and medium for growing animal cells in comparison with the cost of eggs. However, other significant advantages of embryonated eggs are: i) shorter incubation times, ii) simplicity of manipulations and iii) inexpensive equipment needed for production. These considerations are applicable at the laboratory scale, but other cost calculations may need to be done for industrial processes that require different manipulations and equipment.",

An analogous rVV expressing HMPV/FTM- was obtained using the procedure of Blasco and Moss [27]. Briefly, the gene encoding HMPV F was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from HMPV infected cells (strain NL/01/99, a kind gift of A.D.M.E. Osterhaus, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) with specific primers and cloned into the pRB21 plasmid [27]. The plasmid pRB21/HMPV/FTM- was engineered by substituting the amino acid G489 of the F protein by a stop codon. CV-1 monolayers were infected with the vaccinia virus vRB12 [27] and subsequently transfected with the plasmid pRB21/HMPV/FTM-. vRB12 lacks most of the gene encoding vp37, the major protein component of the vaccinia virus envelope, and as a result is unable to form extracellular enveloped virions. Hence, vRB12 is defective in plaque formation under standard conditions. pRB21-derived plasmids carry a complete copy of vp37 and thus, via homologous recombination with vRB12, restore VP37 function. rVV-HMPV/FTM- was obtained from the supernatant of infected/transfected CV-1 cells and subjected to three consecutive rounds of plaque purification, and a virus stock was grown in this cell line.",
