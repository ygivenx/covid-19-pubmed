In addition, other factors such as lower socioeconomic status, exposure to cigarette smoke, air pollution, crowded households, and the lack of breastfeeding have also been associated with severe disease.7 Viral factors associated with virulence leading to severe disease are not sufficiently understood.8\n",

Several studies have compared the severity of disease between infants infected with RSV group A and group B with mixed results.

To improve our understanding of the epidemiological features of respiratory tract infections caused by influenza and other viruses in Mexico, a cohort study to determine the etiology and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with ILI was performed between 2010 and 2014. The study was conducted by the Mexican Emerging Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network (La Red), a collaboration established by the Mexican Ministry of Health and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The study (ILI\u2010002 Study) was carried out at five hospitals in Mexico City and one in San Luis Potos\u00ed. Results from patients enrolled during the first year of the study have previously been described.6 In this report, we analyzed the characteristics of 570 patients (399 children and 171 adults) with confirmed RSV infection included in the study during a 4\u2010year period.",

RSV has been reported to be one of the leading causes of community\u2010acquired pneumonia in adults, just behind Streptococcus pneumonia and influenza virus.3 In this study, RSV was detected in 4.6% of adults with respiratory tract infections and ILI. Previous studies have also found a significant role of RSV in adults; for instance, Johnstone et al.13detected the presence of RSV in 2.6% of cases of community\u2010acquired pneumonia in adults. In a recent study including adults with respiratory tract infections assessed in the emergency room or in the hospital, RSV was also detected in 2.6% of patients.14 In another study, RSV was detected in 7.4% of respiratory illnesses in subjects \u2265 65 years from 14 countries with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe ILI and was more prevalent in hospitalized patients.15 Thus, our results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that RSV is an important cause of moderate\u2010to\u2010severe ILI and may be associated with hospitalization in the elderly.16\n",

The combination of RSV A and rhinovirus was the coinfection most frequently found. The role of other viruses during RSV infection has been subject of previous studies.17 Rhinovirus is one of the most frequently reported viruses in combination with RSV.18 An increase in disease severity during viral coinfection has been suggested in several of these reports. However, not all studies concur in their results.19 In our study, we found the differences in this regard between children and adults; while no apparent effect of viral coinfections was observed in adults, children with RSV infection in whom other pathogens were detected were hospitalized less frequently than those infected by RSV only. However, among hospitalized children, the presence of another respiratory pathogen was associated with admission to the ICU. In order to interpret these results, it is important to take into account that there was a wide variety of coinfecting pathogens and that in some cases two and even three viruses, in addition to RSV, were detected.",

Approximately 40% of subjects with RSV infection that were enrolled in the study had at least one underlying disorder. The most frequent conditions included congenital malformations/congenital syndromes, cardiovascular disorders, chronic lung disease, and asthma. We observed significant differences in the factors associated with hospitalization between children and adults; while multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that young age was the main variable associated with hospitalization in children, adults showed an association between additional factors and the requirement of hospitalization. In this age group, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed an association between RSV infection and age, the presence of any underlying condition, and asthma. In their global study of respiratory tract viral infections in elderly adults, Falsey et al.15found that congestive heart failure, other cardiopulmonary diseases, and noninflammatory cerebrovascular/neurological disorders appeared to be associated with RSV infection; however, on multivariate analysis, no specific factors were associated with this virus.",

In a cohort study of children with severe RSV infection conducted in England, multiple preexisting diseases (relative risk: 4.38) and congenital cardiac defects (relative risk: 2.98) were considered risk factors for death from severe RSV infection.20 Recently, in a multicenter study performed in Spain, Moreno\u2010Perez et al.21 compared the clinical characteristics of two groups of children with RSV infection: those \u201cwith\u201d vs \u201cwithout\u201d underlying diseases. They found that patients with respiratory tract diseases required oxygen therapy more often (OR: 2.99; 95% CI, 1.03\u20138.65). In addition, mechanical ventilation was used more in patients with cardiac diseases (OR: 3.0; 95% CI, 1.07\u20138.44) and in those with inborn errors of metabolism (OR: 12.27; 95% CI, 2.11\u201371.47); this subgroup showed a higher risk of admission to the ICU (OR: 6.7, 95% CI, 1.18\u201338.04).21\n",

Some reports have indicated that subgroup A RSV was associated with more severe disease, whereas others have found the converse.22 In this regard, the systematic and prospective collection of detailed clinical data in our study, as well as the inclusion of patients of a wide spectrum of disease severity, supports the conclusion that no clinical significant differences in disease presentation are seen between the major RSV subtypes. Whether specific strains within each subgroup are associated with the severity of illness remains unclear. For instance, Martinello et al.23 showed that clade GA3 was associated with greater severity of illness. However, strains belonging to this clade appear to be a minority among currently circulating RSV strains.24\n",

As such, not all patients with respiratory tract infections were eligible for inclusion. Nevertheless, our definition of ILI allowed for a wide spectrum of disease severity to be included in the study. Other limitations include the fact that the presence of underlying conditions (including history of prematurity and other chronic diseases) was based on patient self\u2010report, which might not be totally reliable. Also, we did not collect data on palivizumab use which might be relevant in infants; however, access to this prophylaxis is limited in Mexico because of the high cost and, therefore, the number of patients that may have received it is likely to be low.",

We observed that, similar to influenza, young infants and the elderly show higher proportions of RSV\u2010associated hospitalizations than middle\u2010aged adults. However, the precise role of different underlying conditions as risk factors for severe infection in this population could not be established. Additional prospective studies are needed to identify populations that may benefit from current or future preventive interventions against RSV, such as vaccines.",
