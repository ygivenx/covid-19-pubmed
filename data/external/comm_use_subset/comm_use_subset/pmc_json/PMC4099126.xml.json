Viruses are obligatory intracellular pathogens, which depend on host cells for their replication. Understanding the viral life cycle and studying the cellular factors involved in viral infection are crucial for the identification of new antiviral targets and the development of antiviral drugs. As virus entry is the first step in the viral life cycle, inhibition of this essential process is an attractive approach to block virus infection [1]. Current methods for studying viral entry into host cells mostly rely on post-entry parameters, such as replication or the expression of a reporter gene, rather than on measuring entry per se\n[2]\u2013[4]. Studying virus entry directly, i.e. in a virus replication-independent manner, has proven to be difficult, certainly when using low, physiologically relevant amounts of virus particles.",

            "text": "To study distinct virus entry stages (binding, internalization, penetration/fusion) a variety of methods have been applied. Radioactive labeling of structural viral components and electron microscopy (EM) of infected cells have been used to investigate virus binding and internalization [5]\u2013[9]. Radioactive labeling of structural viral components, mostly using [35S]methionine-labeling, can be used mainly to observe binding, internalization, and low-pH induced membrane fusion [5], [10], [11]. In addition to requiring the handling of radioactive components and elaborate protocols, this technique does not allow observing virus fusion directly. The study of virus infections by EM has been used to study infections per se and the viral entry or release process (reviewed in [9], as well as [5], [8], [10], [11]). Even though EM techniques are able to give visual insight into virus entry, including various stages of the entry process, it is still difficult to identify cellular factors and pathways involved in the uptake process with this technique. Also, EM is very labor intensive, usually requires high virus concentrations, and is hardly suitably for medium or high throughput experiments. Virus entry has also been studied by fluorescence microscopy (FM), either by detecting replication-dependent viral protein or reporter-fusion protein expression or by imaging of fluorescently labeled virions. Investigating virus entry by FM of fluorescent reporter protein expression as the name already indicates requires viral replication. This process occurs long after viral entry and fusion has occurred and thus does not allow differentiating between entry and replication (e.g. [12]). The only way to partially differentiate the processes is to add perturbing agents in timely intervals. Investigating entry using fluorescently labeled virions by expression of structural fusion proteins or chemical labeling allows to investigate virus entry in further details, e.g. using co-localization, live-cell microscopy, or tracking studies (e.g. [10], [13]\u2013[16]). Whereas FM reporter protein expression experiments may be used for high-throughput experiments and can be used for a wide variety of viruses, the study of fluorescently labeled virions is laborious, requires high magnification and resolution, and is rarely suited for non-enveloped viruses.",

            "text": "More specialized fusion assays have been developed over the last few decades. Early examples involved labeling of virions using self-quenching dyes or the activation of photosensitized labeling on virions by fluorescent lipids on target membranes [17]\u2013[19]. However, these assays solely allow for the investigation of fusion and not other entry steps, and are very complex and difficult to adapt to non-enveloped viruses. Recently, enzymes have been employed as reporters for virus entry by incorporating them into virions to allow for investigation of entry independent of replication. Therefore either firefly- or gaussia luciferase, or \u03b2-lactamase have been incorporated as structural (lumenal) fusion proteins into virions [20]\u2013[25]. However, the integration of an entire enzyme of several hundred amino acid in size can severely affect virus assembly and/or infectivity. Also only fusion towards the cytosol may be investigated in intact cells. When using the assays by lysing cells it cannot distinguish between internalized and fused virions. The enzymatic assays published so far, with the exception of gaussia-tagged vaccinia virus [25], have been mainly used for fusion measurements only. While all of the above-mentioned methods have their strengths and weaknesses and have proven useful, the lack of assays that distinctly detect the different steps in viral entry hampers the analysis of this important process significantly. There is a clear need for an easy-to-use assay, allowing monitoring of virus penetration, independent of other stages of virus entry or replication in a medium- or high-throughput fashion.",

In the binding assay recombinant viruses containing the \u03b1-peptide as an intravirion protein tag (\u03b1-viruses) are allowed to bind to the surface of target cells on ice. After removal of unbound virus the amount of bound virus particles is quantified by enzyme complementation upon lysis of cells and their attached virions, \u0394M15 being provided either by expression in the target cells or by including it in the lysis buffer. Complementation is detected using a sequential system of substrate conversion by \u03b2-galactosidase and luciferase to generate a luminescent signal (\nFig. 1\n, left). In the internalization assay the previously surface-bound \u03b1-viruses are allowed to enter cells by warming to 37\u00b0C. Surface-bound but not internalized virus particles are removed by protease treatment (e.g. Trypsin or Proteinase K) on ice prior to lysis of cells and internalized virions. This is followed by measurement of complementation as described before (\nFig. 1\n, middle). The fusion assay is based on analysis of intact cells. Thus, \u03b1-virus is bound to cells expressing \u0394M15 and allowed to enter at 37\u00b0C. The spatial separation of the \u03b1-peptide and \u0394M15 is not lifted by lysis but by fusion or penetration of the \u03b1-virus. Subsequently, the activity of the complemented \u03b2-galactosidase is quantitated by measuring its degradation of the non-fluorescent substrate fluorescein-di-\u03b2-D-Galactopyranoside (FDG) into green fluorescent fluorophores fluorescein (\nFig. 1\n, right).",

We pre-tested the complementation assay by transient co-expression of the tagged proteins with the \u0394M15 protein in HEK293T cells, which confirmed that both fusion proteins efficiently complemented the defective galactosidase \u0394M15 as shown for the \u03b1N protein in Figure S2a in File S1. The recombinant viruses were generated by homologous targeted RNA recombination [37]. Their growth properties were affected slightly by the addition of the \u03b1-peptide tag to the N or S protein. The impact on growth of MHV-\u03b1N seems to be merely a delay in growth. The decrease of viral yield for MHV-S\u03b1 is significantly lower but within comparable margins for other recombinant MHV viruses with modified spike proteins (Fig. S3 in File S1). Analysis of their structural proteins by western blot showed the predicted weight shift of 5 kDa for the \u03b1-peptide tagged N protein. Due to its larger size and heterogeneous glycosylation, a shift in electrophoretic mobility was not clearly visible for the MHV-S\u03b1 protein (\nFig. 2a and b\n).

Fusion of the viruses containing \u03b1-peptide-tagged structural proteins with host cells was assessed by inoculation of \u0394M15 expressing cells with increasing concentrations of purified, concentrated \u03b1-virus. To synchronize infection MHV-\u03b1N, MHV-S\u03b1, and VSV\u0394G-G\u03b1* were allowed to bind to LR7 or HEK293T cells expressing \u0394M15 for 90 min on ice. Unbound virus was then removed and cultures were shifted to 37\u00b0C and incubated for 100 (MHV) or 40 min (VSV), based on earlier studies of virus entry kinetics (Fig. S5 in File S1). Incubation was stopped by cooling the cells to 4\u00b0C. Cells were detached on ice and FDG substrate was added in combination with a short hypotonic shock, which results in pinocytic uptake of FDG [41]. Similar results were obtained when cells were pre-loaded with substrate (data not shown, see methods for procedure). To prevent protein degradation and further progression of the infection, resulting in expression of new viral proteins, cells were continuously kept on ice. As low temperatures slow down the enzymatic activity of \u03b2-galactosidase, prolonged incubation was required to obtain a strong fluorescein signal. After MHV-\u03b1N inoculation at MOI = 10, a maximum fluorescein signal was reached after 10 h incubation on ice, which remained stable for 24 h (Fig. S6 in File S1). Inoculation at increasing MOI resulted in increased \u03b2-galactosidase activity, as measured by flow cytometry. The cell density plots show that the maximum fluorescence is equal in low and high MOI infections (\nFig. 3a\n). The median fluorescence shifts to higher values at higher MOI. With this fusion assay significant increases in fluorescein signals were obtained already at MOIs around 2\u20134 for MHV-\u03b1N and at MOIs of 5\u201310 for MHV-S\u03b1 and VSV\u0394G-G\u03b1* (\nFig. 3b\n). In all subsequent fusion assays an MOI of 10 was used and, because of its stronger signal, MHV-\u03b1N rather than MHV-S\u03b1 was the tagged MHV of choice.",

Using minimal complementation of the \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme we were able to detect low numbers of virus particles at any stage of the entry process independent of replication. The assay discriminates between virus binding and internalization and makes it possible to specifically detect and quantify those virus particles that underwent fusion with a host cell. Measuring virus fusion in live cells not only allows for quantitative analysis but also for sorting infected from non-infected cells thereby enabling re-culture these cells. This also allows for combination of the entry assays with replication-dependent reporter assays to investigate later stages of the viral life cycle. Integration of \u03b1-peptide into both model viruses was feasible and had limited influence on their viability, suggesting that this novel method can be applicable to other viruses, including non-enveloped viruses. Particularly for the latter viruses it has proven difficult to integrate bulky tags, while labeling of a surrounding lipid layer is not possible. Generally, every virus for which it has been shown possible to attach tags to intravirion structural proteins will be a good candidate for this assay. Using cytosolic expression of \u0394M15 in target cells does limit the applicability of the assay to viruses fusing towards the cytosol. However, this could be changed by expressing \u0394M15 as a fusion protein in a fusion protein target compartment. Unfortunately, the need to express \u0394M15 in the target cells hampers the investigation of fusion in e.g. primary cells. For \u201cnative\u201d cells, not expressing \u0394M15, the assay can be used to investigate binding and internalization by supplying \u0394M15 during or after lysis.",

Using the fusion assay we confirmed clathrin-mediated endocytosis of VSV to depend on the actin cytoskeleton [10], [30]. Interestingly, the effect of inhibitory agents on MHV entry was very similar to VSV, indicating a comparable uptake mechanism for both viruses. Treatment of cells with chlorpromazine, which causes clathrin lattices to redistribute, affected virus internalization and fusion of both VSV and MHV. Dynasore severely reduced fusion of MHV, but hardly affected internalization of this virus. While dynasore inhibits endocytosis by inhibition of the vesicle scission factor dynamin-2, it does not prevent the formation of invaginations. Viral particles, especially MHV, which in comparison to VSV can be engulfed completely by endocytic vesicles of approximately 100 nm diameter, trapped in such invaginations are likely much less accessible for removal by trypsin.",

Using enzymatic amplification of a tagged viral protein allows looking at viral entry events independent of gene expression. Drugs affecting replication in general, such as translation inhibitors, which will inadvertently affect viral gene expression, can be tested independently for their effect on virus entry. The enzymatically-amplified readout allows performing infections at physiologically relevant conditions. With complementation happening timely proximal to the membrane fusion event, the assay allows for more precise kinetic measurements on virus entry. Also it should become easier to dissect effects of mutations in virions on entry and/or replication. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity can be quantified by a variety of different methods, opening up opportunities for high-throughput analysis by FACS or by automated fluorescence microscopy. The fusion assay might be improved by using yet to be developed alternatives to the FDG substrate, the fluorescein product of which is photolabile. Importantly, as we demonstrated the entry assays can be used in combination with various methods to perturb cellular processes involved in viral entry, including the use of inhibitors, RNA interference, knock-out cells, and by expression of dominant-negative or constitutive-active proteins. Hence we expect them to facilitate research on virus entry significantly.",
