PED is characterized by acute enteric infection and high mortality in sucking piglets, causing enormous economic losses to the swine industry [1,2,3,4]. PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family. The viral genome is approximately 28 kb, arranged with at least seven open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3, E, M, and N. ORF1a and ORF1b are further processed into 16 nonstructural proteins, nsp1 to nsp16. The S, E, M, and N genes encode four structural proteins, whereas ORF3 encodes an accessory protein [5,6,7]. Despite the elucidation of PEDV pathogenesis in some aspects, the underlying mechanism of PEDV replication is still largely unknown.",

            "text": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily highly conserved intracellular degradation process in which double-membrane vesicles (termed autophagosomes) are generated, and the long-lived proteins and damaged organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling [8,9]. Autophagy can be induced by diverse intracellular and extracellular stimuli, such as nutrient starvation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and virus infection [10]. Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy plays both anti-viral and pro-viral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of a broad range of viruses [11]. Specifically, autophagy is an intrinsic host defense mechanism that inhibits viral replication or eliminates viruses by delivering them to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. Meanwhile, viruses develop many mechanisms to block autophagy or even hijack it for their own benefit, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [9,12,13,14]. However, autophagy is also believed to serve as a platform for viral replication, especially for RNA viruses, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and rotavirus (RV), utilizing the membranes of the autophagosome-like vesicles for their replication [15,16,17]. These polar characteristics reveal the complicated relationship between autophagy and viral infection.",

In addition, our previous study demonstrated that mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which was closely associated with cellular autophagy, was down-regulated, and that the autophagy associated protein ATG5 was up-regulated during PEDV infection [19]. These studies indicated that autophagy might participate in PEDV infection, but the specific function of autophagy in the process of PEDV infection has not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that autophagy was triggered in Vero cells during PEDV infection to promote its replication. Moreover, autophagy might mediate the inflammatory responses induced by PEDV infection and have a positive correlation with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

Additionally, large amounts of punctate GFP-LC3 proteins were observed in PEDV-infected cells at 18 hpi, while GFP-LC3 was detected as a diffuse distribution in mock-infected cells (Figure 1B), indicating that the accumulation of GFP-LC3 dots was induced by PEDV infection. The quantitative analysis of the percentage of punctate GFP-LC3 cells in the total GFP-positive cells was performed and 100 GFP-positive cells were detected in each sample.

Thus, the role of autophagy in PEDV induced inflammatory responses was investigated first by measuring the level of inflammatory cytokines under the circumstances when autophagy was suppressed by silencing the expression of Beclin1 and ATG5 proteins. Data showed that the inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, CCL5, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1) were significantly down-regulated at 24 hpi when autophagy was inhibited in PEDV infected cells (Figure 6A,B), suggesting the potential involvement of autophagy in PEDV induced inflammation. It is well-known that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in PEDV induced inflammatory response and Vero cells are interferon deficient [19,29]. Therefore, the influence of autophagy on the NF-\u03baB pathway was determined under the deficient expression of Beclin1 and ATG5 at 24 h upon PEDV infection by immunoblotting analysis. The level of LC3-II decreased, and the phosphorylation of p65 was also down-regulated at the same time (Figure 6C). The results indicated that autophagy might participate in PEDV induced inflammation through the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

In coronavirus infection, the formation of DMVs is usually believed to be associated with the autophagy pathway. This observation was further supported by the accumulation of GFP-LC3 dots in virus induced syncytia and the increased expression of autophagic marker proteins from the immunoblotting analysis. These data indicated that autophagy activity might be triggered by PEDV infection [37]. In addition, autophagy was documented to play a role in syncytia formation, which could further increase autophagy in multinucleated cells as well. Therefore, we inferred that autophagy might closely associate with the syncytia formation in Vero cells during PEDV infection [38,39]. Moreover, the UV inactivation test implied that the effective replication of PEDV was required for autophagy induction. Previous reports indicated that autophagosome accumulation might be attributed to their de novo formation or a block in trafficking to lysosomes for maturation. The cellular state of autophagy can be measured by detecting the degradation of SQSTM1 (p62), using a lysosome inhibitor, or a tandem reporter construct mRFP-GFP-LC3 [40]. Our results from these tests indicated that a complete autophagy process might be triggered to modulate PEDV infection in Vero cells.",

For example, TGEV infection induces autophagy to negatively regulate its replication [35]. IBV can induce autophagy but does not require autophagy for its replication [34]. The specific effect of autophagy induction on MHV infection is controversial. Prentice et al. reported that MHV utilized the autophagy process to form DMVs to enhance its replication [33]. However, another study showed that autophagy was not important for MHV replication [41]. In the present study, the concrete effect of autophagy upon PEDV infection was examined by administrating pharmacological regulators. The yield of PEDV was found to be suppressed whenever the autophagy process was inhibited by 3-MA at the early stage, or by CQ at the late stage. Additionally, the induction of autophagy by rapamycin also enhanced the viral titer. The effect of autophagy modulation on PEDV replication was further evaluated by silencing the two essential endogenous components Beclin1 and ATG5 [26,42]. Beclin1 (ATG6), a critical component in the class III PI3 kinase complex (PI3KC3), is involved in the initial step of autophagosome formation, while the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate, a key regulator, participates in autophagosome maturation [43]. The abolishment of their expression reduced the PEDV titer. These results suggested that autophagy induction might benefit PEDV replication. Autophagy has also been documented to have a complex interaction with apoptosis during viral infection [44,45,46]. For instance, influenza A virus was documented to induce apoptosis in autophagy protein deficient cells [47]. Autophagy was also reported to postpone apoptotic cell death during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection through Bad-Beclin1 interaction [48,49]. The interplay of autophagy and apoptosis during PEDV infection needs to be further elucidated for a better understanding of the autophagy mechanism by which PEDV benefits its infection.",

            "text": "Recently, autophagy has been identified as an important component of the immune system, functioning from the elimination of infectious agents to the modulation of inflammatory responses [50,51]. The crosstalk between autophagy and inflammation has drawn much attention from researchers in recent years, while the relationship between autophagy and PEDV induced inflammatory responses is largely unclear. In the present study, we showed the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway were both restrained in PEDV infected autophagy deficient cells, implying that autophagy might participate in PEDV induced inflammatory responses, especially for the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Meanwhile, Vero cells with a NF-\u03baB pathway deficiency exhibited a decreased level of LC3-II after PEDV infection, suggesting that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway might also have a positive role in autophagy induction. It was worth mentioning that the PEDV yield was reduced in both autophagy deficient or NF-\u03baB pathway deficient cells. The decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by TNF-\u03b1 in autophagy deficient cells might provide new clues for deciphering the complex relationship between autophagy and inflammation. The cause-and-effect relationship between the restriction of PEDV yield reduction on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the restraint of inflammation inhibition on PEDV replication in autophagy deficient cells needs further elucidation. A previous study reported that the positive feedback loop between autophagy and the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade might exacerbate the inflammation induced by H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles [28]. The inhibition of NF-\u03baB was also documented to induce autophagy suppression, leading to apoptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells [52]. We speculate that autophagy and inflammatory cascade reactions might be positively regulated by PEDV infection to exacerbate inflammation. Furthermore, apoptosis might play a pivotal role in the complex relationship between autophagy and inflammation.",

Autophagy induction might be manipulated by PEDV to mediate the inflammatory cascade responses, and have a positive feedback loop with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Our knowledge regarding the interplay between PEDV infection and autophagy is still insufficient. The integrated data facilitate our understanding of the pathogenesis of PEDV infection and provide novel insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Further research can focus on the complex relationship between autophagy modulation and immune responses, as well as apoptosis.",
