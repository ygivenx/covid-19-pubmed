This phenomenon, known as critical slowing down, is expected to be observable in systems which are continually subject to shocks\u2014whose origin can be either extrinsic (for instance, environmental fluctuations) or intrinsic (such as demographic noise). The effects of critical slowing down are manifest in the time series, leading to systematic changes in the summary statistics. For example, due to the persistence of perturbations the time series becomes increasingly correlated, which can be measured by the autocorrelation and correlation time. Because EWS are informed by generic properties derived from dynamical systems theory they have a key advantage over model fitting approaches: detailed calibration is not required. EWS have been applied to anticipate transitions in a range of complex systems, including ecosystem collapse in lakes and microbial communities [5,6], desertification in arid ecosystems [7] and changes in climate [8].",

From theory we know that if R0 < 1 transmission is subcritical and the pathogen is incapable of long-term persistence. Instead, continued circulation can only be sustained through repeated reintroduction from an external reservoir. In this regime, the transmission dynamics are characterized by what are known as \u2018stuttering chains\u2019 [21]. On the other hand, if R0 > 1 the disease will typically invade successfully and grow in a fully susceptible population, leading to a large-scale outbreak and possible endemicity [22]. Such dynamics are referred to as supercritical. It is this transition, from subcritical to supercritical, that we seek to anticipate.",

Conversely, for subcritical emerging diseases there are typically very few infected individuals present in the population. This means that the effects of demographic stochasticity feature strongly in the dynamics [29]. The stochastic dynamics are highly non-Gaussian and the conventional theory of critical slowing down is invalid. In the light of these findings, we instead develop EWS starting from an alternative model, the BDI process, which explicitly incorporates transmission between individuals. By starting from a model which captures the conditions preceding disease emergence, we show how EWS can be expected to behave for this class of transition, and assess their prospects as generic indicators.",

The mean and variance always increase prior to the transition; however, the magnitude of the increase is reduced. The value of R0 for which the variance is maximized is seen to increase. A similar effect is also observed for the index of dispersion, autocorrelation and correlation time. These three EWS all peak around R0 = 1 for large population sizes, but for N = 102 there is a noticeable shift in the peak position and height to the right. For the coefficient of variation, decreasing the population size smooths the abrupt change in value at R0 = 1. The Kolmogorov complexity falls as the transition is approached, in line with the increased correlation: if there is a fluctuation above (or below) zero within the detrended data it is more likely to be sustained in further data points. Regular sequences allow for increased use of the copy operation (see appendix B), reducing the complexity of the time series. Perhaps counterintuitively, the complexity of the time series is lower near the transition for larger populations. The entropy has a very similar behaviour to the variance, peaking in the vicinity of the transition.

Owing to the absence of multiple replications, these are calculated over a moving window [4]. However, when the disease emerges over a finite time scale, the process is non-stationary, and therefore also non-ergodic, due to changing R0(t). In practice, this means that averages are calculated using data points which were generated at different values of R0; for example, if T = 10 years and W = 100 weeks, the difference in R0 between the start and end of the window is 0.38. This reduces the responsiveness of the EWS, also contributing to the lag behind the BDI process results. Furthermore, there can be other artifacts arising from non-ergodicity, for instance, increased variance of the data. Increasing both the window size and transition speed exacerbates these effects due to the larger range in values of R0.",

For diseases emerging in populations structured as many loosely connected smaller community units, such as Ebola in sub-Saharan Africa, this may significantly impact on predictability. R0 is a measure based on the average context; however heterogeneities in the contact structure of individuals can lead to instances of superspreading [22], particularly relevant for sexually transmitted diseases and something not captured in the BDI process. The large variations in transmission rates reduce the worth of R0 as a measure, and a universal increase in R0 is unlikely to be the driver of emergence. Superspreading events have been identified for SARS and more recently for MERS [21,40]. In addition, there is the challenge of incomplete and unreliable data, modelled through explicit inclusion of a reporting process [41].
