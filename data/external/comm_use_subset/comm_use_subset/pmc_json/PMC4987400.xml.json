            "text": "Astroviruses are small viruses with a diameter of approximately 28\u201330 nm. Their single-stranded RNA genome ranges from 6.8 to 7.9 kb and contains three open reading frames (ORFs) with a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) and a 3\u2032 UTR, and a poly-A tail. ORF1a encodes the non-structural (NS) polyprotein, while ORF1b and ORF2 encode the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral capsid structural protein, respectively [4, 7]. These viruses belong to the family Astroviridae, which is divided into two genera: Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, depending on the organisms they infect. For many years, this criterion was also used for further classification of astrovirus strains into separate species. Within the genus Avastrovirus, such division distinguished two turkey astroviruses, turkey astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) and type 2 (TAstV-2); two chicken viruses, avian nephritis virus (ANV) and chicken astrovirus (CAstV); and duck astroviruses (DAstV) [15]. However, a number of astroviruses have been found recently in different bird species; moreover, it turned out that they could be transmitted between species [6]. The new official astrovirus classification system is based on the amino acid sequence of viral capsid protein and most of the above-mentioned astroviruses have been assigned to three species: Avastrovirus 1, Avastrovirus 2, and Avastrovirus 3. When this classification was created, due to the lack of available sequences, CAstVs were referred to as \u201crelated viruses which may be members of the Avastrovirus genus but have not been approved as species\u201d [8]. In the meantime, the full genomes of two CAstV strains and the capsid gene of additional CAstVs from different geographical locations have been sequenced [3, 9, 18]. A phylogenetic analysis of available CAstV ORF2 sequences showed that they clustered in a group provisionally representing a new species [9]. This avastrovirus group also varies because different subgroups can be distinguished [3, 18]. In recent years, there have been more viruses awaiting formal classification, such as duck hepatitis virus type 2 (DHV-3), DHV-3-like astroviruses, duck astrovirus CPH (DAstV CPH), duck astrovirus SL-like, duck astrovirus YP-like and astroviruses detected in wild birds [5, 10\u201312, 22].",

The inoculated eggs were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and candled daily for 5 days. After cooling, allantoic fluids and altered organs of embryos were harvested. Applied molecular methods revealed a large amount of CAstV genome (Ct value of about 15-16) in these samples. The isolated virus was designated as PL/G059/2014. The allantoic fluid was then used in the experimental reproduction of \u2018white chicks\u2019 condition and for extraction of RNA for further molecular characterization. We sequenced a nearly full-length genome of the viral isolate PL/G059/2014 at the commercial service Genomed Sp. z o.o. (Poland). Library preparation, further investigation and \u201cnext-generation sequencing\u201d using an Illumina MiSeq System (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) were performed. Reads were assembled into contigs and compared to sequences in the GenBank nucleotide and protein databases using BLASTn/BLASTx.

The nearly complete genome sequence contained a partial 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (nt 1-7, positions 15\u201321 of the reference GA2011 sequence), and 3\u2032UTR (nt 7156-7382, positions 7315-7521 of the reference GA2011 sequence). Examination of the first nucleotides of the virus revealed the presence of two in-frame AUG codons of ORF1a, beginning at position 8 and 20, respectively (GCGATGGCCCAGGCCATGG8-23), both with the strongest positive effects on translation. ORF1a is 3427 nt long and encodes a polypeptide of 1139 amino acids (aa) with a calculated Mr of 129.77 kDa. As in the case with other astroviruses, there is an overlap region between ORF1a and ORF1b (nt 3409 to 3427), which contains the heptameric frameshift sequence AAAAAAC (nt 3418-3424) known as RFS (ribosomal frameshift signal). ORF1b is 1559 nt long and encodes a polypeptide of 519 aa with a calculated Mr of 60.41 kDa. As is typical for astroviruses, a 24-nt spacer between the stop codon of ORF1b and the start codon of ORF2 with a highly conserved CCGAA pentamer at positions 4980-4984 is also present. ORF2 is 2162 nt long and encodes a capsid protein precursor of 720 aa with a calculated Mr of 80.01 kDa. Rfam analysis of (http://rfam.xfam.org) revealed the presence of a highly conserved coronavirus 3\u2032 stem-loop-II-like motif (s2m) consisting of 23 nt of ORF and the adjacent 18 nt of the 3\u2032UTR (7136-7178). The exact role of s2m remains obscure, but recently, it was described as genetic element that, through an RNA-interference-like mechanism, influences gene expression in the infected organism, providing some kind of selective advantage for the virus [21].",

The next astrovirus strains with similarity to PL/G059/2014 were DAstVs CPH and C-NGB, with nucleotide sequence identity of 56.7 % and 55.8 %, respectively (Table 1). The amino acid sequences of ORF1a and ORF1b of PL/G059/2014 shared the highest identities of 86.5 % to 93.8 % with the published sequences of CAstVs GA2011 and 4175 as well (Table 1). However, the aa sequence similarity of ORF2 to these chicken astrovirus strains was rather low, at the level of 32.7-35.2 %. The PL/G059/2014 strain had the highest ORF2 aa sequence identity to P22-18.8.00 and VF08-36 strains, and it ranged between 80.8 % and 82.1 %. The next astrovirus strains with similarity to PL/G059/2014 were DAstV-2 strains (representative SL5 in Table 1), with 49.4 % nucleotide sequence identity. In turn, the studied strains showed the lowest similarity, at the level of 20.3 %, to astroviruses detected in wild aquatic birds in Cambodia and Hong Kong [5].",

The ORF1a of PL/G059/2014 was most closely related to that of DAstV-1; and ORF1b, to that of DAstV-3. This situation was also observed in ORF1a and ORF1b of other CAstV strains, GA2011 and 4175. However, in the case of these two CastV strains, similarity of ORF2 to that of DastV-3 was also observed. Surprisingly, the ORF2 of PL/G059/2014 was more closely related to a duck astroviruses, DastV-2. This may suggest that the nonstructural and structural protein genes of the PL/G059/2014 came from three different ancestor astroviruses, all hosted by ducks. A recombination event between astroviruses with different hosts of origin as one of the main mechanisms of virus evolution was previously suggested [11, 13, 19, 23]. Taking into consideration that many different avastroviruses have recently been detected in ducks and that their genomes showed phylogenetic relationships to poultry astroviruses, it seems probable that ducks may play an important role in the epidemiology of astrovirus, similar to the case with avian influenza virus [1].",

On the other hand, the p-dist values with chicken astroviruses GA2011 and 4175 were 0.613-0.644, but only 0.178-0.192 with CAstVs P22-18.8.00 and VF08-36 (Table 2).

With regard to ORF2 protein structure, the most closely phylogenetically related strains were European CAstV strains that are responsible for enteric and respiratory problems in chickens, as well as hatchability issues [2, 18, 22]. We detected some differences in the capsid protein sequences of these strains, but their implications for pathogenicity are unknown. To investigate this question, whole astrovirus genome sequences should be compared, but they are currently unavailable. However, it should be remembered that pathogenicity could be influenced by the dose and route of inoculation, age and breed of chickens, level of maternally derived or acquired antibodies, and co-infection with other pathogens. For these reasons, conclusions about the pathogenicity of the virus based on their genome sequences should be made with caution.",
