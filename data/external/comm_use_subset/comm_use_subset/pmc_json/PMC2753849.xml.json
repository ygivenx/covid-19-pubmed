As one of their many other roles, DNA microarrays can also be used to characterize both large-scale and small-scale genetic variations. For instance, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is commonly used in human cancer studies to genotype cell lines by detecting gene loss and copy number variations [2]. At a finer resolution, microarrays are also used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms at targeted loci [3]. In addition to human screens, microarrays have been widely used for the detection and genotyping of microbial species. Notably, a viral genotyping microarray [4] was one of the methods used to etiologically link severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to a novel coronavirus [5]. Arrays for the detection and comparative analysis of bacterial genomes have also been developed, including arrays for Listeria monocytogenes [6-10], and many other bacterial species. However, these earlier, low-density arrays did not contain enough probes to target the entire genome of the bacterium, and were forced to probe only a small subset of the known genes.",

To maximize the expected specificity of the array, repetitive probes must be avoided and experimental conditions, such as melting temperature, equalized. This creates an optimization problem in choosing which sequences should be included on the array [12,13]. In smaller microbial genomes, it is possible to target every position of the genome with overlapping probes, simplifying the design process. For example, extreme high-density arrays can now accommodate 2.1 million variable length probes on a single chip (Roche NimbleGen, Inc). For an average 2 Mb sized bacterial genome and 50 nt probe length, probes can be offset by only a single base-pair and still span the entire genome, generating a coverage of 50\u00d7. By tiling the entire genome, some suboptimal probes will be included on the array, but can be identified and corrected for in the analysis. These overlapping arrays are capable of identifying polymorphism at a much finer resolution than gapped arrays.",

However, single-genome arrays can only detect and analyze sequences similar to those included on the array, and cannot discover or analyze sequences absent in the reference strain. After the introduction of the pan-genome concept [14,15], it has become increasingly clear that some microbial species contain significant genetic diversity, and it is not suitable to compare against only a single reference strain. The pan-genome hypothesis states that any given species has two sets of genes. First, a set of core genes present in all strains that define the species; and second, a set of dispensable genes present in only one or a few of the strains that presumably mediate adaptation. A single genome describes the genomic material for a particular strain, but the pan-genome describes the genomic makeup for an entire species. Single reference tiling arrays cannot survey this full diversity. Ideally, an array for analyzing new strains should cover the genomic diversity of the entire pan-genome.",

The simplest strategy is to fully tile the genomes of each strain independently. However, due to similarities between the strains, some sequences would be tiled with excessive redundancy, and this approach would be cost ineffective. Instead, a pan-genome array should aim to minimize costs by using the minimal probe set necessary to target every element of the pan-genome with adequate coverage. The typical approach for targeting multiple strains is to group individual genes into gene families and then probe only the conserved sequences of those families [16-18]. For example, Willenbrock et al. designed an innovative 32 strain Escherichia coli pan-genome array by clustering homologous genes based on pairwise alignment similarity [16]. Homology was defined as gene alignments with an E-value < 10-5, a bitscore > 55, and alignment coverage of at least 50% of the gene length. For each resulting gene group, a consensus sequence was generated via multiple alignment, and probes were designed to target the most conserved regions of the consensus. The resulting array comprised 224,805 probes, targeting 9,252 gene groups, with a median coverage of 27 probes per gene group.",

Firstly, a slight variation in a gene (e.g. a partial deletion) can be responsible for a significantly different phenotype. By only targeting the conserved portion of gene families, the variable regions responsible for these differences will not be included on the array. Secondly, a gene-centric design includes only coding sequences. Therefore, these designs cannot be used to detect differences in intergenic regions which may include regulatory elements, or used for studies that require a whole-genome tiling, such as transcriptome mapping or chromatin-immunoprecipitation-chip (ChIP-chip) studies. Finally, gene-centric design models depend on an accurate annotation of the genome. If genes have been mis-annotated or omitted from the annotation, such genes cannot be properly represented on the array. This is particularly troublesome for many draft-quality genomes that have highly fragmented sequence assemblies and lack accurate annotations. For these reasons, a whole-genome tiling is preferable for applications that require more flexibility or an unbiased tiling of the genome. However, no methods have been described for efficiently tiling multiple whole-genome sequences.",

The prior gene-centric approaches are abandoned in favor of a more concrete, probe-centric approach that relies only on the genomic sequences and not the annotation. To summarize the new approach, let the pan-genome G be the set of all genomes from a species, and let P be the non-redundant set of all length k substrings from G. Due to sequence conservation between genomes, a single probe may match to multiple locations (genomes) of the pan-genome. Call these matches the probe targets. The Pan-Tiling problem is to find a minimum cardinality subset H \u2286 P such that all sequences of G are targeted by probes in H and no target is offset more than maxoff from an adjacent target (or sequence end).",

The key to the strategy is choosing probes that will hybridize to as many of the strains as possible, while using only a necessary amount of probes to cover polymorphisms (insertions, deletions, variants). For example, Figure 1b shows a pan-genome tiling for two miniature genomes, with a maxoff of one-third the probe length. Genomes A and B are identical except for a small insertion in the middle of B. Fully tiling both genomes requires a total of 19 probe targets (9 for A and 10 for B), but probe set H illustrates that these 19 targets can be tiled with just 12 probes. Conserved probes are used to tile the left and right of both genomes, and distinct probes are used to tile the two polymorphism variants. This is obviously a simplified example. The problem becomes more difficult as the number of genomes and complexity of polymorphisms increases.",

The species of L. monocytogenes is composed of three primary genetic lineages (named I, II, and III) that display different capabilities of environmental survival and pathogenic potential to cause human infectious disease [20]. In order to both characterize new strains based on genetic content, and detect polymorphism at a higher resolution in small RNAs (sRNAs) and intergenic sequences, the array was required to cover all pan-genomic sequences with a high density of probes. This bacterial species is particularly well suited for pan-genome array design because there are a remarkable number of strains that have been sequenced. At the time of writing, a total of 20 L. monocytogenes complete or draft genome sequences were available, totaling 57.9 Mbp (Table 1). Genomic sequences and annotations were obtained from The National Microbial Pathogen Database Resource (NMPDR) [21]. The sequence conservation for the sequenced strains was computed with Nucmer [22], and ranges between 94% and 99% in nucleotide identity versus the completed EGD-e reference strain. Even with such substantial diversity within the species, the PanArray algorithm is able to design a pan-genome tiling covering each genome at more than twofold coverage using only 385,000 50-mer probes. A similar density tiling for a single L. monocytogenes strain would require 125,000 probes, meaning the PanArray design covers 20\u00d7 more genomes using only 3\u00d7 more probes. A description of this design, along with array designs for six other bacterial pan-genomes is given in the Results section.",

Therefore, the window length is equal to one half maxoff. For example, given a maximum offset of 2l, windows are marked off every l bases of the pan-genome--with the first window w1 covering the interval [1, l], and the second window w2 covering [l+1, 2l], and so on. Assuming one target is chosen per window, and the target locations are evenly distributed within windows, the average distance between adjacent targets is expected to be equal to the window length. For a window length l, equal to the probe length k, the resulting depth of coverage averages one, because the probes are spaced k bases apart on average. For any other window length l, the resulting depth of coverage c is expected to be c \u2248 k/l.

As before, a probe p hits a window if a match between p and G begins within the window's interval. Thus far exact matches have been assumed, but a match can be defined by any criteria necessary for efficient hybridization. To help reduce probe redundancy, the PanArray implementation can optionally use inexact matches containing a single mismatch. Any suitable k-mer indexing algorithm can be utilized for this phase, but allowing for mismatches can be computationally expensive. The implementation uses a fast, but memory intensive, compressed keyword tree for indexing all probe hits. Alternatively, a slower, but memory efficient, hashing scheme would also work. To index the 1-mismatch hits, each probe's 3k possible 1-mimsatch permutations are added to the index as well. The result of the indexing is a list of positions and windows for all k-mers of the pan-genome (the probe candidates). At this stage, the final list of probe candidates may be manually filtered based on typical criterion such as melting temperature, GC content, secondary structure, etc. For ungapped tilings, it is impossible to avoid suboptimal probes. However, highly repetitive probes can be identified by the number of genomic positions they map to, and should be discarded if they threaten to confound the array analysis (e.g. by affecting normalization). Alternatively, the input sequences may be masked prior to k-mer indexing to avoid repetitive or unwanted sequence altogether.",

The idea being that choosing probes with the highest coverage will minimize the total number of probes necessary to cover all windows. However, this approach does not properly account for the probe coverages. Only a single probe is needed to cover a window, so after selecting a probe p, all other probes that hit a window in Wp will see their effective coverage reduced. Take for instance two probes p and q that hit the exact same set of windows. Choosing p reduces the effective coverage of q to zero, because all of q's windows have already been covered by p.

To avoid this complexity, the PanArray implementation exploits a property of the residual coverages that allows it to recompute only a few values at each iteration. Note that for any p, its residual coverage rp can never increase. A probe's coverage either remains the same, or decreases because one of its windows was hit by the prior iteration.

This process is repeated until a valid residual returns to the front of the queue. Often, newly computed residuals will return quickly to the head of the queue before the others have been updated. At this point it is unnecessary to update any other residuals because their new values cannot be greater than their current value. Therefore, the head of the queue must be the updated maximum.

Most importantly, this strategy allows for intergenic sequence and unannotated genomes to be included on the array, and annotation updates to be incorporated as they become available. For example, after the L. monocytogenes array had been designed (see Results), over 40 new sRNAs were discovered in Listeria [27]. Neatly, the sequences of each had already been tiled by the array design, and the updated annotation was easily remapped onto the array. As another example, the gene counts provided by NMPDR in Table 1 are inconsistent and vary between 3,000 and 5,000 genes per genome, suggesting considerable annotation error.

            "text": "As suggested in the Introduction, L. monocytogenes is a good candidate for constructing a pan-genome tiling array because the species has been widely sequenced, with 20 complete or draft genome sequences available. To confirm that the sequenced genomes contain the majority of L. monocytogenes genetic diversity, the pan-genome size was estimated using the methods of Tettelin et al. [15] as implemented in the Ergatis package [29]. Seventeen of the eighteen L. monocytogenes genomes listed as annotated by NMPDR in Table 1 were used in the analysis (strain 1/2a F6854 was unavailable at the time). According to the cited method, the addition of an Nth genome was simulated by searching the annotated genes of each genome against all possible permutations of N-1 other genomes. Genes without a match over 50% protein similarity for at least 50% of their length were recorded as \"new\". The number of new genes n expected to be discovered in the Nth sequenced genome was modeled by the power law n = \u03baN-\u03b1, and the parameters \u03ba and \u03b1 were estimated from the data via non-linear least squares regression using the R function nls [30]. The regression was performed on the full set of over 1 million data points. A power law model was found to fit the L. monocytogenes data better than the originally proposed exponential model. This agrees with a recent suggestion that a power law is a more appropriate model of the pan-genome phenomenon [31]. The estimated number of undiscovered genes is shown in Figure 2. The power law exponent \u03b1 was found to be 1.38 \u00b1 0.002, suggesting that the L. monocytogenes pan-genome is closed (i.e. has a finite number of genes), and the sequencing of more genomes would eventually sample the entire set of dispensable genes. Therefore, it appears the vast majority of L. monocytogenes genes have been sequenced and are included on the array. This model predicts that the addition of a 21st genome to Table 1 would yield only ~ 6 new genes. However, only a single lineage III genome was included in this analysis, so this prediction might be artificially low for a new lineage III strain. The sole lineage III strain analyzed (FSL J2-071) contains 31 genes absent in any of the lineage I and II strains.",

The runtime for the final design process was dominated by building the k-mer index, which required 84 minutes using a compressed keyword tree.",

To facilitate easy comparison, all designs were created with a window length of 25 bp, a probe length of 50 nt, and allowing for probes to contain a single mismatch to their target. As with the L. monocytogenes design above, draft genomes were included, but contigs less than 2 Kbp were discarded. The results are given in Table 2. Probe \"reuse\" is measured in the average number of targets per probe. It is rare for a 50-mer probe to match to more than one location per genome, so the number of targets per probe is roughly equivalent to the average number of genomes that a probe matches.",

This is a reflection of the diversity of strains that have been sequenced and the low level of nucleotide conservation between strains, with some strains differing by as much as 8% (see Table 1). Any SNP rate of higher than 2% (1 per 50 bp) exceeds the 1 mismatch threshold per probe and requires additional probes to target the divergent sequence. However, as more variants are added to the array, the addition of each successive genome requires fewer new probes than the last, on average. Figure 5 shows this relationship for the L. monocytogenes strains. Successive strains are added by order of lineage, from the bottom of Table 1 to the top, and the design is recomputed at each step. There are pronounced jumps in the number of probes required when the first of a new lineage is added, but the number of probes needed to tile the rest of the lineage quickly levels off.",

The Results section has shown that this algorithm is applicable for all currently available bacterial pan-genomes. However, if the maximum number of probes is limited, or the genome size is extremely large, it may be necessary to design a tiling with gaps between the probe targets (i.e. a maximum offset greater than the probe length). In this case, it is necessary to choose unique probes that avoid unwanted cross hybridization between repetitive sequences within the genome. To achieve this, repetitive probes can be filtered, or the coverage scores used in the PanArray algorithm can be weighted to penalize repetitive probes. For example, probe coverage can be redefined as the number of genomes a probe targets, rather than the number of windows, and probes targeting multiple windows in the same genome can be appropriately down-weighted. In many cases, probes within the same window will share the same coverage score, and rules can be applied for breaking the tie and choosing the most reliable probe. Similar schemes could be devised to favor probes with any other desirable criteria.",

Duplications or deletions in the experimental samples are evident as non-zero values of the log ratio of the two normalized signals. So-called segmentation algorithms examine this log ratio across multiple positions in reference sequence to determine the boundaries of the variations [34,35]. The most accurate methods consider not just individual probes, but a context of probes around a genomic location, and can identify even small polymorphisms between the strains. These analyses require both a reference signal and a reference coordinate system on which the probes are tiled. Usually a whole-genome tiling is constructed for a single reference strain, but because PanArray provides a whole-genome tiling for every reference strain included in the array, the same array design can be used to perform segmentation analysis against any reference strain on the array.",

In these cases, traditional segmentation or log-ratio analysis must be replaced by a method that does not require a reference hybridization signal. For gene-level analysis, direct analysis of the individual probe intensities provides comparable sensitivity and specificity versus segmentation analysis [16], and various methods have been developed that operate independently of a signal ratio [16,37,38]. A probe-based approach provides the most flexibility for pan-genome array analysis, because each probe can be individually scored based on its own intensity, and the genes can be classified based on the aggregated scores of the individual probe scores without the need for a control hybridization.",

Probe based methods, like microarray, are especially well suited for situations where sequencing is inefficient because there is a low abundance of target DNA and a high abundance of background DNA intermixed. For example, applications such as real-time pathogen detection, surveillance, and diagnostics require a known sequence of DNA to be targeted from a vast environment [32,39,40]. A pan-genome array could be used for the detection and genotyping of pathogens from a large environment, without needing to isolate the individual cells. Pan-genome arrays could also be used to capture all species- or locus-specific genomic material from an environment, which could then be directly processed or sequenced separately from the metagenome. Microarray based genomic capture has already been applied to targeted human resequencing as an efficient means of enriching for desired sequencing templates [41-43].",
