An exercise rehabilitation session takes place in real-time in a Virtual-Room between a group of no more than eight patients under the coordination of a health professional. The platform supports real-time bidirectional transfer of high definition video (image and sound) between the coordinator (central station) and the participating patients (home stations). In addition to the high definition video, the platform records all of the patients\u2019 biosignals, i.e. 3-lead ECG, Heart Rate, Oxygen Saturation and Blood Pressure, in real time. This information (video, audio, biosignals) is presented through a user-friendly interface. An automated procedure allows the patients to seamlessly join the virtual rooms and attend the exercise sessions.",

To enable biosignals monitoring and transmission, wearable lightweight, portable (battery powered) wireless (802.11b) devices with biosignal sensors are involved. Specifically, the wearable devices monitor and transmit (via direct connection) to a central unit the patient\u2019s biosignals; that is, 3-lead electrocardiogram, derived respiration rate (Moody et al., 1985), blood pressure (non-invasive), oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) and accurately estimated heart rate. A belt, attached to the patient\u2019s waist and shoulder, guarantees security and stability of the devices. Furthermore, to facilitate the exercise rehabilitation program, the following exercise equipment accompanies a home station: (a) electromagnetic legs ergometer that features adjustable workload from 10 to 350 watt (interval steps of 5 watt) directly from the console, a flywheel \u2265 6Kg, vertical and horizontal adjustable handlebars, vertical and horizontal user adjustable saddle, wide gel padded seat and pedals with quick adjustment strap. A leg ergometer is adjusted to each patient during the first assessment; (b) resistance bands from 2lbs to 13lbs (6 color-coded resistance levels). Each patient gets several bands of different color (for easy identification) and resistance level as required by the patient\u2019s resistance bands exercise set. The resistance level for each exercise is decided after assessment at the beginning and at the middle of the tele-supervised exercise program; and (c) soft weights of 0.5kg to 3kg (6 weight levels) which are also individually assigned to patients according to the initial and mid assessment of the resistance exercises.",

CRF stores more than 100 individual fields and eight health surveys and medical examinations. Non-private data are exported to comma separated value (csv) files for further processing using statistical analysis software such as SPSS.

Particularly, health professionals have access to specific data views for specific patients based on their role (i.e., the psychologists cannot view demographic data and ICU scores). Only the research coordinator has full access to the data.

The initial investment for the entire technical equipment (including devices, systems, software etc.) is estimated to be 382,000 Euros. Consequently, the analysis established that both measures were positive (Table 4). The sum of cash flows (costs and benefits included) of every year in a five-year period was calculated with an annual discount rate of 10%, resulting in 30,000 Euros NPV for Tele-Rehabilitation. The IRR was calculated to be 11.8% which is higher and thus, better compared to a standard discount rate of assumed 10% (Table 4).",

Physical disability deterring participation was observed in 14% (12 with mental deficit plus 2 with mobility deficit). The majority of the non-eligible patients (75%) were patients with ICU stay less than 48hrs; therefore, patients with low probability of ICU related disability. A telerehabilitation program for former ICU patients could be addressed with some changes from the above described, not only for the eligible patients of this study but also for patients with poor neurological outcome, poor functional ability, end stage chronic illness and probably hospital discharge to chronic health care facilities or other hospitals.
