The experimental protocol was approved by the Iowa State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval No. 2-14-7742-S). In brief, 3-week-old PEDV negative pigs were inoculated with 10 ml of the 5th passage of PEDV isolate 13-19338E at a tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of 5 \u00d7 102 per ml via the oral route or sham-inoculated with 10 ml of virus negative culture medium via the oral route. Rectal swabs were collected at 0, 1, 3 and 7 dpi. Serum samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 dpi, fecal samples were collected at 28 dpi, and the samples were aliquoted in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. The pigs were humanely euthanized and necropsied at 28 dpi. Presence or absence of PEDV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR on rectal swabs [2], [3] and by an IgG immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in serum samples as routinely performed at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Lab (ISU-VDL).",

PEDV strains can be divided into genogroup 1 and genogroup 2 based on significant amino acid differences in the N-terminal domain of the S gene [4]. PEDV infection has resulted in high economic losses in Asian pig industries, the disease has been reported in 2013 in North America and in 2014 in South America [5] and recent outbreaks have been described in Europe during 2015. Most PEDV strains circulating in Europe and in Asia prior to 2010 belong to genogroup 1 while the more recent outbreaks were associated with PEDV genogroup 2. PEDV genogroup 2 can be divided in at least two major clusters, one containing the strains similar to the ones that emerged in the US in 2013 (U.S. PEDV prototype strain) and the other cluster containing PEDV strains with distinct insertions and deletions in the spike gene (S INDEL strains) [6]. Although the antigen used for the ELISA development in the present study was based on the U.S. PEDV prototype strain, the same protocol can be applied for S1 antigens based on different strain sequences that may be more relevant in a certain geographic location.",

Therefore, for mucosal infections, measurement of localized IgA immune responses is critical to evaluate protection derived either by vaccines or by previous pathogen exposure. Indeed, a previous study has shown that anti-PEDV IgA antibodies in serum samples correlated with protection against a subsequent challenge 21 days after the first inoculation [18]. In veterinary diagnostics, serum is a standard sample for serological testing; however, in case of enteric pathogens, testing fecal samples perhaps would allow a better assessment of local immunity.",

Drawbacks include the presence of inhibitors and a lower concentration of analytes. A good correlation was found between the levels of PEDV IgA antibodies in serum and fecal samples indicating that either fecal material or serum could be used for assessing local PEDV immunity in pig herds. Future studies should also assess oral fluids for suitability as a sample type to assess herd immunity. However, similar to fecal samples, inhibitors and low analyte concentrations may impair detection of antibodies in this sample type [19]. In addition, pen-based oral fluid samples represent composite samples from 25 up to 350 pigs and establishing the rates of individual protection appears not feasible.",
