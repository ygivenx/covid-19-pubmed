Even in developed countries, syndromic surveillance for animal diseases, including zoonoses, are rudimentary. To overcome this deficiency, the Triple-S project, co-funded by the European Commission, is forging synergies between the human and animal health sectors by providing scientific and technical guidance on syndromic surveillance in real-time or near real-time which encompasses emerging zoonoses (7). Examples of international organizations that report and respond to zoonoses, including emerging zoonoses, are listed in Table 1. These organizations, including the WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) have several different roles, including monitoring, notification regarding cases/and outbreaks, and technical support.\n",

However, detection and surveillance systems for emerging zoonoses in the developing world are much less functional. In that regard, surveillance systems for wildlife, exotic animals, and companion animals have not been established. Wildlife represents a significantly large and often unknown reservoir for emerging zoonoses, in addition to being a reservoir for re-emergence of zoonoses previously controlled. Factors for emergence of zoonoses from wildlife include a burgeoning human population leading to exploitation of forest areas for agriculture and dwelling, ecotourism, outdoor activities, and live animal trade (8).",

Countering them mandates the adoption of a one-health approach involving various stake holders, including ecologists, to understand the host\u2013parasite interaction in the natural reservoir and to understand the ecological constraints, often limiting adaptation to other hosts. Providing early warning of zoonotic pathogen emergence requires a one-health surveillance system at local, regional, and global levels. Evidence updates on diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic interventions; antimicrobial resistance; and public health policies would support clinicians, public health practitioners, scientists, and policy makers to prevent and control emerging zoonoses. To accomplish this, a multi-disciplinary evidence-based strategy integrating with the existing EBP resources would provide a useful tool. Such a coordinated strategy should be essentially translated and disseminated in an open access performing platform to be of utility in real-time emergency preparedness and response.",
