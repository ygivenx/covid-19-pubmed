The pathological changes in lung alveoli most likely follow a common pathway characterised by an acute phase of protein-rich alveolar fluid influx into the alveolar lumina as a consequence of the injury to the alveolar wall. Subsequently, type-2 pneumocyte (see\nGlossary) hyperplasia occurs to replace the loss of infected type-1 pneumocytes and to cover the denuded epithelial basement membrane, resulting in restoration of the normal alveolar architecture. Severe alveolar injury may lead to fibrosis with loss of alveolar function in more protracted cases.\n",

Adult mice infected with varying doses of SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract show no clinical signs of disease, although the virus replicates in respiratory tissues, peaking early after infection, with viral titres in the lungs reaching relatively high levels. The infection is accompanied by only mild inflammatory changes of the respiratory tract. On the other hand, aged mice, as well as hamsters and ferrets, do show signs of clinical disease (weight loss and ruffled fur), albeit, in most cases, in the absence of the typical lung lesions seen in humans with SARS [\n4\u20136].\n",

Moreover, multiple foci of acute DAD are observed, characterised by flooding of alveoli with protein-rich oedema fluid mixed with variable numbers of neutrophils and rare syncytia (\nFigure 1), and by extensive loss of epithelium from alveolar and bronchiolar walls. These lesions are quite similar to those observed in humans in the acute stages of SARS. Although clinical signs (respiratory distress and general malaise) were observed, they were not further studied in the initial experiments.\n",

They show that infection of these macaques with a molecularly cloned SARS-CoV resulted in a mild-to-moderate symptomatic illness, indistinguishable from the illness induced with wild-type SARS-CoV. Chest radiographs from several infected animals showed unifocal or multifocal pneumonia that peaked between eight to ten days postinfection. The authors point out that the results are reminiscent of the milder syndrome observed in younger humans infected with SARS-CoV. Molecular modification of the cloned virus may now further allow deciphering of the role of different viral gene products in the pathogenesis of SARS. An important result of this present study is the observation that one group of animals inoculated via the nasal and ocular route exhibited significant faecal shedding of SARS-CoV. Thus far, efforts to evaluate the efficacy of SARS-CoV vaccines have largely aimed at protecting the respiratory tract.\n",

Although none of the current animal models have fully reproduced all features of SARS, the most important aspects of SARS are observed in experimentally infected nonhuman primates. Such models have already demonstrated the protective effect of pre- and postexposure use of pegylated human interferon-\u03b1, of candidate SARS-CoV vaccines, and of convalescent sera from SARS patients (unpublished results; [\n10,\n11]). In the absence of ongoing human SARS-CoV infections, candidate SARS vaccines may have to be approved on the basis of animal data alone, preferably in two different species (the \u201ctwo animal rule\u201d). But in order for such approval, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SARS pathogenesis and the preventive efficacy of such vaccines need to be well understood. The present study further supports the use of nonhuman primate SARS models for pathogenesis studies and for the development of intervention strategies. Infection of cynomolgus macaques with recombinant SARS-CoV containing defined modifications may allow further elucidation of SARS.\n",
