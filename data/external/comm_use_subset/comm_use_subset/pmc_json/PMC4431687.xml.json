            "text": "Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is classified as a member of the genus Gammaretrovirus in the family Retroviridae and causes an immunosuppressive, oncogenic and runting-stunting syndrome in multiple avian hosts[1]. REVs comprise a variety of strains, including nondefective REV-A, defective REV-T, spleen necrosis virus (SNV), chick syncytial virus (CSV), and duck infectious anaemia virus (DIAV)[2]. Recently, the co-infection of REV with other avian viruses has been reported, potentially representing additional dangers to the poultry industry[3, 4]; moreover, the risks associated with the worldwide distribution of REVs are unknown[5\u20137]. The enhancement of avian reticuloendotheliosis disease due to concomitant infection is most likely a consequence of its immunosuppressive ability [8\u201310]. However, the mechanism of REV-induced tumourigenesis and immunosuppression has not yet been fully characterised.",

REV, avian leucosis virus (ALV), and Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV) are the main causes of neoplastic diseases in avian hosts. Recently, our group reported the expression kinetics of transcripts and their relative expression profiles for both MDV infection and ALV-J infection[13, 15]. To the best of our knowledge, the effects of REV on changes in global gene expression in infected host cells have not been previously reported. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the transcriptional profile of host responses to REV infection at different time points post-infection in chicken embryo fibroblast cells using microarray analysis.",

In this study, CEFs were plated at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells per well in 24-well culture plates and then inoculated with pre-treated virus suspensions. The CEFs were infected with REV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.

REV infection was verified using an indirect immunofluorescence assay with a mouse anti-REV monoclonal antibody[16]. All cell cultures were seeded simultaneously. Cells were harvested at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-infection (dpi). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Chinese Council on Animal Care. All experiments complied with institutional animal care guidelines and were approved by the University of Yangzhou Animal Care Committee.",

The microarray data have been submitted to the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE66320. Differentially expressed genes were then identified based on fold-changes and P-values calculated using Student's t-test. The threshold for up- and down-regulated genes was a fold change > = 2.0 and a P value < = 0.05. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG) (CapitalBio, Beijing China) analyses were applied to determine the potential roles of these differentially expressed mRNAs based on GO terms or pathways. Finally, hierarchical clustering was performed by using GeneSpring software to visualise the distinguishable gene expression patterns among samples[15].

These results provide an overview of the host response to REV infection with respect to the top 10 enriched GO terms of differentially expressed genes in each category (Fig 4). The following GO terms were most commonly implicated in the biological process category: immune response, biological adhesion, regulation of phosphorylation, antigen processing and presentation, defence response, cell surface receptor linked signal transduction, regulation of cell proliferation, defence response, and response to organic substance. Additionally, we identified a total of 37 differentially expressed genes associated with the immune response term during the time course of REV infection (S4 Table).",

Of these differentially expressed genes, REV infection may have resulted in the strong induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) such as RSAD2, ISG12-2, OASL, MX1, and IFIT5 to ensure viral survival. This phenomenon is consistent with human retrovirus[23] and avian retrovirus infections[15]. Classical ISGs have been increasingly studied and characterised in chickens (e.g., the IFN signal transduction cascade, the Myxovirus resistance proteins (Mx), Protein kinase R (PKR), and 2\u2019-5\u2019-oli-goadenylate synthetase (OAS))[24]. In this study, the differential expression of ISGs was higher during the late stage when the cells were infected with a much larger dose of virus. Indeed, at day 1 post-infection, some of the genes displayed no differences in expression levels. ISGs have continued to be identified and their antiviral activities have been characterised because these clearly diverse factors are critically important for viral pathogenesis[25]. Our current understanding of how ISGs display multiple antiviral functions is largely derived from studies involving the interference of various steps of the viral life cycle[26]. Based on these studies, the antiviral abilities of ISGs are due to the collaboration of multiple ISGs at steps ranging from virus penetration through virus release rather than the function of any single ISG[27].",

Members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family have emerged as key sensors that recognise viral components such as nucleic acids[28, 29]. In this study, the transcriptional level of TLR-3 molecules was significantly increased, whereas the transcriptional level of TLR-2 and TLR-4 was decreased after REV infection. TLR-3 is known to play a key role in the host response to virus infection by detecting virus-derived dsRNA in intracellular vesicles[30], whereas TLR-2 and TLR-4 recognise viral structural proteins on the plasma membrane [31]. Our results suggested that the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 might be inhibited, causing a diminished immune response to REV infection. In birds, recognition triggers the downstream signal transduction to activate NF- kappaB or IRF-3/7 and finally induces interferon and inflammatory cytokine production[32]. Thus, the up-regulation of STAT-1 could be due to increases in IRF-7-mediated signalling. In this study, differential expression of STAT-1 was also associated with higher cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses[33]. The up-regulation of NF-kappaB observed in response to REV infection may provide a necessary signal required for enhanced virus entry and synthesis of viral proteins inside the cells[34, 35].",

Beta-2-Microglobulin (\u03b22M) contains a distinctive molecular structure called a constant-1 Ig superfamily domain that is shared with other adaptive immune molecules including MHC class I and class II[37]. The variation in MHC class I and \u03b22M gene expression might provide insights into host-virus interactions, such as those involved with in vitro and in vivo infections of the Marek's disease virus[38]. Thus we propose that the complement system activated by REV infection might serve as a functional bridge between the innate and adaptive immune responses, and these correlation mechanisms allow an integrated host defence to pathogenic challenges[39].",

Moreover, REV DNA has been found to be integrated at multiple sites in acutely infected chicken cells, resulting in cell apoptosis and substantial damage of the immune organs and inevitably leading to immunosuppression[44]. In vivo, expression levels of interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-15, IL-17F, IL-18 and colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 are significantly down-regulated, whereas interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are markedly increased in PBMCs at all stages of infection.

SSI family members are cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signalling[54, 55]. SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 have been implicated in feedback effects on IL-6 signal transduction through binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of a component of its receptor (gp130)[56]. SOCS-1 can negatively regulate the TLR3-mediated innate immune response and inhibit the TLR-2- and TLR-4-mediated signalling pathways by targeting the adaptor protein Mal, which induces the ubiquitin-dependent pathway and is involved in signalling via TLR-2 and TLR-4[57, 58]. Additionally, SOCS-3 might inhibit the TLR3 signalling pathway through the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRAF-6[59], and it is widely accepted that the anti-inflammatory properties of SOCS-3 induce a reduction in TNF-alpha levels[60, 61]. Because SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 were significantly up-regulated in this study, the host response to REV infection suggests a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that may be critical for REV immunosuppression.",

Therefore, we speculated that the regulation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway participated in the pathogenesis of REV infection in a manner similar to that observed for ALV-J infection[15]. Several differentially expressed genes were involved in the MAPK and Wnt signalling pathways. A strong association of these signalling pathways with tumourigenesis has been reported by many studies[63\u201365], suggesting that they may be involved in tumourigenesis induced by REV.",

While many of these genes and pathways have been previously associated with avian RNA virus infection, this study identified significant canonical pathways associated with REV infection. Additionally, we have provided further insight into the differences and similarities among differentially expressed genes implicate in inflammation, antiviral activity, and immunosuppression. It suggests that these strategies of host-adaptation by REV are involved in transcriptional control of immune responses. Further studies will be required to define the functions of the genes identified during in-vitro viral infections and to elucidate the virus and host mechanisms that modulate the host gene expression response.",
