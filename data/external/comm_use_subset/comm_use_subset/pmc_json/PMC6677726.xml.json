Understanding etiology of respiratory illnesses in resource-limited countries may support clinicians with patient management and provide a framework for decision makers when prioritizing public health interventions. Recently, with availability of multi-pathogen molecular diagnostic methods, and increasing recognition of viruses in cases of ALRI, the use of nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab specimens to identify pathogens associated with ALRI has increased2\u20134. However, NP/OP swabs may not accurately reflect etiologic agents from the lower respiratory tract5. Sputum specimens, on the other hand, have been considered a more representative sample of the lower respiratory tract5, but have not been extensively explored, especially in tropical countries.",

In contrast, another multisite study in low-middle income countries, observed that the pathogen yield from NP/OP and sputum specimens were similar2. Given the paucity of data and the difference in observations in these two recent studies, and that most data from tropical countries were derived from paediatric populations, we aimed to investigate adults living in a tropical, low-income setting. Here we describe the performance of NP/OP swabs against sputum specimens for detecting respiratory pathogens among adult patients hospitalized with ALRI using the TaqMan Array Card (TAC).",

Sputum specimens were collected through expectoration (quality sputum defined as <10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field) in clean 3 ml tubes and transported at 2\u20138 \u00b0C to KEMRI/CDC laboratories in Kisumu where they were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until testing. Nucleic acids were extracted from the sputum specimens, using a modified MagMaxTM (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) viral RNA extraction procedure to include dithriothreital (DTT) treatment stage to break down sputum. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of 500 mM DTT solution was added to 100 \u03bcl of sputum, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The MagMaxTM viral RNA extraction procedure was performed on 200 \u03bcl material following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The extracted total nucleic acids from NP/OP and sputum were tested using TAC as described by Kodani et al. and Weinberg et al.4,10. Each target of the 30 pathogens was considered positive if it passed the internal positive control and had exponential fluorescence curves crossing the assigned threshold at a threshold cycle (CT) value of <35. For targets with two wells, the target was considered positive when either of the two wells was positive. Results with CT > 30 for Legionella spp. were disregarded due to probe degradation of the specific chemistry used in preparation of this TAC.",

The authors looked at adults who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness, although the difference in yield from the two types of specimens was not impressive (15% increase in viral detection using sputum). Moreover, they only collected NP swabs which could have led to less representation of respiratory viruses with tropism to the oropharynx14. Wolff et al. also observed the detection of more viruses in sputum, where CT values were earlier for almost all pathogens compared to that found in NP/OP swabs6, leading the authors to argue for the benefit of sputum use in diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections. However this position was not supported in the recent work done by Thea et al.2, where they looked at children <5 years hospitalized with ALRI and pneumonia, or by our study done among adults. Perhaps in tropical countries, the likelihood of multi-pathogen detection may be higher than that seen in temperate countries, for children and adults alike, which may merit further investigation.",

Furthermore, Thea et al. noted that the yield of pathogens from high quality induced sputum was similar to that of low quality induced sputum suggesting that specimen collected from the upper respiratory tract (i.e., NP/OP) could be used when investigating ALRI. The biggest challenge in these studies, including ours, is the interpretation of multi-pathogen detection, particularly when trying to attribute a specific pathogen as the cause of an episode of ALRI. Many bacterial pathogens detected from respiratory specimens could reflect carriage, being part of the normal microbiome, and not necessarily associated with the disease process. Similarly, viral pathogens detected in respiratory samples could indicate recent past infections. The early CT values from the upper tract could indicate higher pathogen load and be associated with pneumonia15, which would suggest that NP/OP swabs could be used when investigating lower ALRI etiology if interpretation is combined with CT values. However, establishing causality can be challenging even when considering organism density (here we used CT values as proxy). The use of radiographic images, epidemiologic data, clinical course of illness, and the possibility to investigate lower respiratory tract specimens collected aseptically could be important tools to add to the investigation of ALRI/pneumonia.",
