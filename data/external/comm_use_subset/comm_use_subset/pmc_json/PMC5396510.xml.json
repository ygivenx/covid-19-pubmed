            "text": "It is natural to suppose that the first cells that GNPs encounter on their way in the mammalian organism are those of the immune system, in particular its phagocytic link (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells). Indeed, as early as in the first attempts to investigate colloidal gold biodistribution, which were performed in the 1960s\u201380s on rabbits,8 mice,9 and rats10,11 it was found that after parenteral administration, colloidal gold particles are captured by liver cells, excreted through bile, and eliminated from the organism with feces. After injection, gold was identified mostly in Kupffer cells. Perhaps Scott et al.\n8 were the first to note that the phagocytosis of GNPs is size dependent. Besides Hardonk et al.,10 the important role of Kupffer cells in the elimination of GNPs was established by Sadauskas et al.,12 who injected GNPs intravenously in mice. Electron microscopy showed that after injection, the GNPs accumulated in the macrophages of the liver (90%) and spleen (10%). The authors concluded that GNPs penetrate only phagocytes, primarily the Kupffer cells of the liver. In a subsequent study,13 Sadauskas et al. reported that GNPs get localized in lysosomes (endosomes) of Kupffer cells and can be retained there for up to six months. The influence of size, solubility and surface modification on the biocompatibility of GNPs and their use in biological applications is well known.14,15 However, the effects of nanoparticle properties on the immune system are still being explored.",

            "text": "The immune system cells constitute the first barrier to nanoparticle penetration of animal tissues and cells. Therefore, the study of GNP interactions with phagocytes, the mechanisms of intracellular uptake, and the responses of immune cells to GNPs is undoubtedly of major interest. Perhaps the first detailed consideration of these issues can be found in Shukla et al.,16 who, using three microscopic methods, examined the uptake of 3 nm GNPs into RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The conclusion from their study was that small GNPs enter macrophages through pinocytosis and get localized mostly in lysosomes and in the perinuclear space. On the whole, Shukla et al.'s data indicate that the GNPs are biocompatible, noncytotoxic and nonimmunogenic and that they suppress the production of reactive oxygen species and do not cause elaboration of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL1-\u03b2 (which contradicts the data of Yen et al.\n17). In contrast to data by Shukla et al.,16 Yen et al.\n17 noted that on the administration of GNPs, the number of macrophages decreases and their size increases, this being accompanied by elevated production of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. We emphasize that the data of Shukla et al.\n16 were obtained for very small (3 nm) particles. However, Lim et al.,18 using much larger (60 nm) hollow NSphs capped with dextran, and Zhang et al.,19 using 60 nm GNPs, achieved results similar to the findings of Shukla et al.\n16 for the same cell culture. Sumbayev et al.\n20 showed that citrate-stabilized GNPs specifically downregulate, in a size dependent manner, the cellular responses induced by IL-1\u03b2 both in vitro and in vivo. In a recent study, Guev\u00e9l et al.\n21 demonstrated that 12 nm gold nanoparticles induce cell mediated responses accompanied by inflammatory natural killer (NK) cell stimulation, whereas 2 nm gold nanoparticles are more efficiently taken up without inducing dendritic cell maturation or lymphocyte proliferation. To summarize, the published data revealed strong effects of the GNP size and functionalization on production of proinflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "Quite interesting data were acquired by Bast\u00fas et al.\n26,27 with 10 nm nonconjugated GNPs. From their results, it follows that indeed, on entry into murine bone marrow macrophages, GNPs do not affect the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, if the GNP surface is modified with the peptide AGIP (amyloid growth inhibitory peptide, LPFFD) or SAP [sweet arrow peptide, (VRLPPP)3], GNPs, on entry into the macrophages, involve the induction of NO synthase and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. In addition, they inhibit macrophage proliferation. The recognition of GNP\u2013peptide conjugates was made more effective through toll-like receptors 4 (TLR-4) on the surface of the macrophages. Yet, Staroverov et al.\n28,29 demonstrated that both 15 nm nonconjugated GNPs and their conjugates with high- and low-molecular-weight antigens, on entry into rat peritoneal macrophages, enhance their respiratory activity and the activity of macrophage mitochondrial enzymes (Fig. 1). GNPs also have greatly increased the production of IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 2). Lee et al.\n30 reported that the penetration of gold nanorods (GNRs) and SiO2-coated GNRs into macrophages induces the release of inflammatory mediators (cytokines, prostaglandins, etc.) and the activation of immune response genes. Thus, in addition to early observations by Shukla et al.\n16 for bare GNPs, the published data26\u201329 indicate a significant role of surface coating in macrophage response after GNP uptake.",

The immunostimulating activity of synthetic oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs may be analogous to that of oligonucleotides from bacterial DNA.37 According to Wei et al.,36 GNP\u2013CpG conjugates were effective in enhancing nanoparticle internalization in RAW264.7 macrophages, and they greatly increased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (15 nm conjugates did so to a greater degree than 30 nm ones did).

Increasing the PEG coating density reduced serum protein adsorption and changed the composition of the adsorbed protein layer. Particle size also affected serum protein adsorption through a change in the steric interactions between the PEG molecules. Both the density of PEG molecules on the GNP surface and the size of GNPs determined the mechanism and effectiveness of macrophage uptake, possibly because the composition of the adsorbed blood serum proteins and their availability to cells were regulated. If the density of PEG coating was lower than \u223c0.16 PEG molecules per nm2, the macrophage uptake of GNPs depended on the presence of adsorbed proteins (serum-dependent uptake). If the density was higher than \u223c0.64 PEG molecules per nm2, serum-independent uptake was seen (Fig. 3).",

By now, a great deal of work has been done on the modulation of immune response in patients with chronic infections and oncological diseases by using antigen-primed dendritic cells.52 GNPs have been named, among other carriers, for application in antigen delivery to dendritic cells. For example, Cheung et al.\n53 described the use of 15 nm GNPs for presenting a peptide antigen associated with Epstein\u2013Barr virus to dendritic cells. According to their TEM data, peptide-functionalized GNPs penetrated the dendritic cell cytoplasm but were not found in the nuclei. The uptake of GNPs by dendritic cells resulted in an increased content of \u03b3-interferon, the presentation by major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) of the antigen to CD4+ T cells, and, correspondingly, activation of an epitope-specific immune response by cytotoxic T cells.",

From their findings, the GNPs that had entered cell endosomes were not cytotoxic and had no effect on the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. However, they did promote the secretion of interleukin IL-12p70, which is directly involved in the activation of T cells and, thus, in the regulation of an antigen-specific immune response. The authors also noted the development of long dendrites and an increase in the cell-surface amount of MHC-II molecules, which present antigens to T lymphocytes. Thus, even nonfunctionalized GNPs are immunostimulatory to both dendritic cells and macrophages.17\n",

This interest is mainly due to the physicochemical (nonspecific) theory of immunity proposed by J. Bordet, who postulated that immunogenicity, along with antigenic specificity, depends predominantly on the physicochemical properties of antigens, first of all on their colloidal state. L. A. Zilber made successful attempts to obtain agglutinating sera to colloidal gold76 (interestingly, a repeated attempt to prepare antisera to colloidal gold was performed almost 80 years later, in 2006).77 Yet, several authors have shown that the introduction of a complete antigen together with colloidal metals promotes the production of antibodies.78 Furthermore, some haptens may cause antibody production when adsorbed to colloidal particles.79 Numerous data on the influence of colloidal gold on nonspecific immune response are given in one of the best early reviews.80 In particular, it was noted that at 2 h after an intravenous injection of 5 mL of colloidal gold into rabbits, there was a sizable increase in total leucocytes in 1 mL of blood (from 10 000 to 19 800) against a slight decline in mononuclear cells (from 5200 to 4900) and a considerable increase in polynuclear cells (from 4700 to 14 900).81 On injection of other colloidal metals, no such phenomena were observed. Unfortunately, with advances in immunology and with denial of many postulates of Bordet's theory, interest in the immunological properties of colloids decreased. There is no doubt, though, that the data obtained on the enhancement of immune response to antigens adsorbed on colloidal particles were utilized for the development of various adjuvants.82,83\n",

Traditionally, this problem is solved by chemical attachment of a hapten to a protein matrix called a schlepper (from the German schleppen \u201cto drag\u201d), and by the use of adjuvants and intensive schemes of animal immunization with the obtained conjugate.87,95 Bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, thyreoglobulin, hemocyanin and diphtheria or tetanus toxoids (in the case of synthetic peptides) are generally used as schleppers. However, this method yields antibodies to both the hapten and the immunodominant sites of the carrier. Note that when such a carrier is used, a pronounced immune response to weak antigens does not always develop. Besides, the subsequent purification and screening of the obtained antibodies are laborious and expensive, and their titre and affinity are often low. Most currently used adjuvants based on oil emulsions and on suspensions of inorganic substances are, as a rule, liable to phase separation, are often reactogenic, and their immunogenic properties vary with time. Many of these adjuvants cause local and systemic toxicity.82\n",

In particular, synthetic polyelectrolytes (poly-l-lysine, polyacrylic acid, polyvinylpyridine, sulfonated polystyrene, ficoll, etc.) were proposed for use as adjuvants.96 These polymer compounds are produced by chain-radical polymerization of the corresponding monomers. The simplicity of polyelectrolyte composition and synthesis, the possibility of obtainment of polymer chains with a wide range of molecular masses (i.e., of various lengths), their solubility in water, and other properties (the capacity for conformational transitions, the formation of complexes with proteins, etc.) opened up possibilities for the use of polyelectrolytes in immunologic investigations. Such adjuvant carriers are capable of antigen deposition at the sites of injection, enhancement of antigen presentation to immunocompetent cells, and induction of production of necessary cytokines. However, the low immunogenicity of such complexes, due to their small epitope density, prompts researchers to look for new nontoxic and effective carriers additionally possessing adjuvant properties.",

In some cases the application of GNP conjugates produced higher titers and affinity. Often the levels of specific antibodies produced in the immunization of animals with gold nanoparticles conjugated antigens were higher than that generated by classical adjuvants while the amount of antigen required to achieve this response was an order of magnitude lower than for immunization with a standard adjuvant.143 The reasons for this may be due to greater accumulation of the antigen in cells such as dendritic cells allowing greater presentation of the therapeutic antigen to the immune system. The readers can find below a similar consideration of a several studies for adjuvant properties of GNPs, although such unique examples is not sufficient to consider a significant massive of collected experimental data.",

If the gene expression is effective, these proteins serve as antigens for the development of an immune response.181,182 In the early papers, immunization was conducted by a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of a \u201cnaked\u201d DNA. However, for this purpose, a \u201cbiolistic\u201d transfection, using GNPs, began to be applied almost simultaneously. It was found to be very effective, apparently because of the multiplicity of sites of transgene interaction with tissues and because of transgene penetration directly into cells and nuclei.183,184 The method of gene immunization, often called DNA vaccination, which was well-developed in experiments with animals, has shown high efficiency especially in respect of viral infections: tick-borne encephalitis, HIV infection, hepatitis B, and some others.185\n",

In particular, GNPs conjugated to antigens were found to influence the activation of T cells: a tenfold increase in proliferation, as compared with that observed on the addition of the native antigen, was found.

According to the current view,94 the presentation of an antigen to T cells is preceded by its processing, i.e., cleavage into peptide fragments followed by the formation of bonds with molecules of the major histocompatibility complex, which transport the antigen fragment to the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. It remains unclear, then, how this process can proceed with a hapten. The hypothesis of the multivalent antigen, i.e., the antigen formed because of the high local concentration of univalent antigens on the surface of a gold particle, does not answer this question either.

As in the case of the usual cells, interactions with various types of receptors on the surface of immune cells and, correspondingly, various types of GNP endocytosis depend largely on the surface functionalization of GNPs. Many researchers believe that the key role in macrophage uptake of GNPs is played by scavenger receptors.
