            "text": "Cryptosporidium is a genus of protozoan parasites infecting a wide range of hosts [1]. All groups of vertebrates are susceptible to Cryptosporidium infection worldwide. This parasite is the etiological agent of cryptosporidiosis, which is mainly characterized by diarrhea in humans and livestock. Massive outbreaks of enteritis in people such as in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (USA) have increased public awareness of this parasite [2]. In humans, the prevalence and severity of infection increase in immunodeficient individuals such as AIDS patients. In immunocompetent patients, the disease is self-limited [3]. No drug therapy is yet available and the high resistance of oocysts to environmental conditions and chemical treatment make cryptosporidiosis difficult to control [4]. Cattle have been considered to be a primary reservoir for Cryptosporidium oocysts for zoonotic C. parvum [5]. These animals could be a risk factor via environmental contamination from their manure being spread on farmland or their grazing on watersheds [6]. On farms, transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. can result from ingestion of contaminated food or water, by direct transmission from host to host, or through insect vectors [7]. In cattle, infection by Cryptosporidium spp. was first reported in 1971 [8]. Since vaccines have become commercially available against Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, and coronavirus, Cryptosporidium has emerged as the main neonatal diarrheic agent in calves [9]. In farm animals, the economic impact is related to morbidity, mortality and growth retardation [10]. Among the 24 species previously described (if the three fish species are accepted without complete genetic characterization) [1,11-13], C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae and C. andersoni usually infect cattle. C. parvum has zoonotic potential and is a frequent cause of human cryptosporidiosis [14]. C. bovis and C. ryanae have not been found in humans and there is only one description of C. andersoni in a patient [15]. Recent reports have described an age-related distribution of these aforementioned species in dairy cattle on the east coast of the United States [16-18], India, China, Georgia [19], Malaysia [20], and Denmark [21]. The most prevalent species were C. parvum in preweaned calves, C. ryanae and C. bovis in postweaned calves and C. andersoni in adult cows [16,17].",

These studies on dairy calves reported a within herd prevalence of Cryptosporidium without identifying species or the relation to the host's age. The present study was conducted in 15 farms in Brittany, France to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in veal calves. We used genotyping and subtyping for the molecular study of Cryptosporidium isolates. Follow-up of the same animal allowed us to determine the outcome of the infection and the age distribution of Cryptosporidium species.",

They belonged to three industrial veal producers representative of integrators in France and did not present any known history of Cryptosporidium infection. These farms were located in four administrative regions (Figure 1): C\u00f4tes d'Armor (CA1-CA3), Morbihan (MO1), Ile-et-Vilaine (IV1-IV5), and Mayenne (MA1-MA6). During the summer and autumn of 2007, all farms were visited three times and fecal samples were taken from 142 animals exhibiting diarrhea at the age of 5 weeks old. Calves arrived in fattening units at the age of 2 weeks old and were confined in small groups from four to six animals per pen. Because of a concomitant welfare study [24], calves had to stay 2 to 3 weeks without any external stress despite the farmer's presence. At the age of 22 weeks old, calves were finally sent to the slaughterhouse. Consequently, sampling was done at the ages of 5 weeks, 15 weeks, and 22 weeks (Table 1). These points of sampling corresponded to the beginning, the middle and the end of the fattening period. Fecal samples were collected and shipped by a veterinarian. Collectors respected the following criteria: use of a single pair of latex gloves per animal, a single plastic sterile cup per animal, and collection of at least 5 g of feces per sample. Feces were collected directly from the rectum of each animal and stored at 4 \u00b0C in potassium dichromate (2.5% wt/vol) until processed. Cups were capped, labeled with the animal's ear tag number, and accompanied by a form recording the date of sampling, the animal's sex, breed, identification number, and the mean age of the herd.",

The prevalence of 70.4% obtained in this work tended toward the upper end of the scale compared to other investigations done in France which ranged from 15.6% in beef herds [30] to 95% in suckling calves [23] and in other European countries where prevalence ranged from 3.4% to 96% [32,33]. However, the sampling program did not allow the study of animals under 5 weeks of age. Indeed, the animals arrived in these structures at the age of 2 to 3 weeks and farmers did not allow sampling before two complete resting weeks for each animal. Therefore, our results could underestimate the real prevalence as Huetink et al. showed that the percentage of parasite excreting animal declines after the third week of age [34] and that the first peak of prevalence is at the age of 15 days [17].",

C. parvum was predominantly detected in 5-week-old calves (86.7%) compared to C. ryanae or C. bovis detected in 4.4% and 1.5% of the positive samples respectively. It is noteworthy that these results are very similar to data obtained in Ireland on calves under 30 days of age with 95%, 3.6%, and 1.3% of prevalence of the same species, respectively [39] and in the UK on animals over 3 weeks old with 93% C. parvum, 6% C. bovis, and 2% C. ryanae [40]. In contrast to previous studies [17,41], C. ryanae and C. bovis were found with similar prevalence predominantly in 15 week and 22 week old calves. This association between the age of the cattle and the Cryptosporidium species identification has been supported by several studies [17,19,21,38,40] but different reports suggest that Cryptosporidium species repartition regarding the age of the host could be due to a technical artifact. Despite the fact that the methodological strategy based on PCR using genus specific primers and partial direct sequencing of the 18S rDNA is commonly used to identify Cryptosporidium species [42], this molecular tool is limited in the case of mixed infections. Feng et al., [19] suggested that the important shedding of C. parvum in preweaned calves had probably masked the concurrent infection of these animals by C. bovis or C. ryanae. Furthermore, previous reports suggested that a dominant Cryptosporidium species in a sample can be preferentially amplified by PCR [43,44]. It is noteworthy that this situation of mixed Cryptosporidium species infection in farm animals would be more prevalent than originally believed [45-47]. Mixed Cryptosporidium species could also explain sequencing difficulties encountered in this work. The simultaneous presence of several species in the same sample could lead to amplification and sequencing of different genetic fragments leading to unreadable superimposition of electrophoregrams.",

This observation provides evidence that a previous infection with C. parvum did not protect calves against an infection with other Cryptosporidium species. Fayer et al. suggested that the peak of cryptosporidiosis prevalence in young calves could reflect the immaturity of the immune status [48]. It was also suggested that the low excretion of C. parvum oocysts in older calves might be related to the development of immunity that also protected the animal against a secondary challenge [49]. It has been reported that immunity arises in the first two weeks after infection [50]. Interestingly, Fayer et al. [51] described that calves previously challenged with C. parvum were able to excrete oocysts after a second challenge with C. bovis but not with C. parvum. The authors concluded that immunity to C. parvum was not extended to C. bovis. Consistently, in our study, the presence in the same animal during sequential sampling of C. parvum, C. bovis and C. ryanae suggests that immunity against C. parvum and against C. bovis did not extend to C. ryanae. Furthermore, the observation that one animal excreted sequentially C. parvum, C. ryanae and C. bovis suggests that immunity against C. ryanae did not extend to C. bovis as well.",

Among the 48 gp60 subtypes formerly described in cattle [55], only six were identified in this work, being IIaA15G2R1 the most commonly found.

Thus, the subtype IIaA15G2R1 was found in 74.5% of the samples in this work, 68.9% in The Netherlands and 68.6% in England.

The IIaA16G3R1 determined in 5.9% of our samples, was characterized in 4.65% in The Netherlands and 5.8% in England. It is remarkable that subtypes, IIaA16G2R1, IIaA16G1R1 and IIaA13G2R1 were equivalently underrepresented in these three countries.
