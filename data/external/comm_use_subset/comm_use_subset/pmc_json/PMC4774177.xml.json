            "text": "Pathogens are considered to be one of the driving forces of evolution. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a genomic region containing immune response (IR) genes, which play a crucial role in host and pathogen interactions. MHC class I and class II genes encode antigen-presenting molecules responsible for the dual recognition of antigenic peptides on the cell surface [1]. MHC-encoded antigen presenting molecules are thus directly involved in molecular interactions with specific peptides derived from pathogens to which a population is exposed. Therefore, the MHC genes are under strong selective pressure and contain signatures of both positive and negative selection [2]. To counteract the high variability of pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules, the MHC of Gnathostomata evolved into a region of considerable heterogeneity in its organization, number, and extent of polymorphism both within and between species [3\u20135]. Spanning approximately 4 megabases (Mb), the MHC region consists of hundreds of different genes with a variety of functions including antigen presentation and processing as well as non-immune processes [1]. Consequently, MHC class I and class II genes are amongst the most polymorphic genes studied in vertebrates with more than 100 alleles reported in different species, including humans [6, 7]. In MHC class II genes, a majority of the functionally important polymorphisms are concentrated in exon 2, which encodes the antigen-binding site of the molecule [8, 9]. This diversity is correlated with pathogen richness [10].",

Studies of MHCs in different model species contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of infectious diseases. Economically as well as culturally important among domestic animals are camels, with their long history of adaptation to arid environments and with their capability of providing transport and various commodities important for human development [11\u201313]. Currently, three extant species of Old World camels are recognized [14\u201316]. The dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) and Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) are key domestic species in semi-arid and desert areas and are used for food production and camel racing throughout many Arabian, Northern African and Asian countries. The only surviving and critically endangered wild camel species (Camelus ferus) is closely related to them and diverged from the domestic Bactrian camel approximately 1,000,000 years ago [14, 15].",

The immune system of camels displays characteristic features of practical importance, like heavy chain antibody homodimers [21, 22]. Furthermore, all extant Camelus species are renowned for their ability to cope with harsh environmental challenges, including high temperatures, drought, and famine combined with high level of physical activities. However, little is known about the MHC genomic region, its organization and diversity in camels [23].",

For this purpose, species- and locus-specific regions were identified by BLAST [33] search of bovine DRA, DRB, DQA, and DQB, exon 2 sequences against the wild Bactrian camel draft genome assembly [16]. This approach was successful for all loci except DQB, because no DQB-like sequences were found in the draft genomes available. In a second step, based on the camel-specific sequences retrieved during the first round of amplifications, primers located in the neighboring introns and amplifying the full-length exon 2 sequences could be designed. In addition, we developed a set of primers specific for each locus separately to check possible allelic dropouts (Table 3). As for DQB, attempts to use bovine primers DQB-LA40, DQB-LA41 and DQB-LA48 [35] failed. Eventually, the zoo-primers GH28 and GH29 amplifying DQB exon 2 in various mammalian species were used successfully [36].

We realigned reads near insertion-deletion polymorphisms, recalibrated the base quality scores, and identified variants according to the recommended guidelines for the Genome Analysis Toolkit v3.1-1 [46, 48]. We identified the genomic location of the MHC class II genes in the dromedary reference using a nucleotide BLAST [33] search. We compared these regions with the variants identified above and inferred haplotypes when phase could be unambiguously determined (\u22641 heterozygous genotype in the locus). Frequency of heterozygotes was calculated based on Sanger sequences as a proportion of heterozygotes out of all individual camels sequenced.",

High number of shared alleles as well as the overall low allele count as shown in the Fig. 4 for respective loci suggests that the conservation of these sequences among camelids is still higher than similarities with other species and among these other species as shown in Table 7.

            "text": "MHC class II genes are highly variable between different species due to differences in numbers of genes evolved by duplications as well as in the extent of polymorphism between individual genes [59, 60]. Intraspecific variation may be due not only to high numbers of genes and alleles, but also to variation in gene number among individual haplotypes observed in different species, including cattle [61]. It was therefore surprising to observe low variability in the MHC class II exon 2 genomic sequences in the three camelid species. Low numbers of alleles and high numbers of homozygotes in all loci, and many alleles shared across species substantially differ from most other mammalian species with tens or even hundreds of alleles and a high degree of heterozygosity [7]. Based on our observations, we extended the numbers of animals analyzed making sure that the camels studied originated from all major regions in the world (see Additional file 1). Three approaches (Sanger, NGS, cloning) were used to confirm the sequences retrieved and different primer pairs spanning overlapping regions were used to minimize allelic drop-outs. In addition, zoo-primers amplifying canonical MHC class II loci in other species were used. All these approaches produced similar results. The extent of allelic variation identified in groups of animals comparable to studies of other mammalian models seems to be unusually low in this particular family. We only can speculate whether there is another methodological limitation, which avoided us to assess the entire range of existing variation or whether there are reasons related to the biology of this family. Our data did not provide information about the extent of genetic variation in other MHC genes, especially in the class I loci. Lower MHC variation in different species is usually associated with (i) bottlenecks or reduced sizes of specific populations [62], (ii) pathogen-poor environment [63], (iii) particular traits of social interactions such as monogamy combined with small population numbers and low reproduction rate [64], or (iv) limited chance for lateral pathogen transmission [65]. Out of these, the pathogen poor environment is an attractive hypothesis. We observed a lower overall genomic heterozygosity in dromedaries compared to domestic and wild Bactrian camels, which could hint to a generally lower genetic diversity in dromedaries (Fitak et al. in prep). However, for the MHC region, the low level of genetic diversity was observed in all three species.",

In this situation, we had to use the zoo-primers GH 28 and 29, shown previously to amplify exon 2 DQB sequences from at least two loci of multiple mammalian species [36, 74]. The partial DQB exon 2 sequences obtained here contained high numbers of SNPs, with many non-synonymous substitutions. However, they showed the same patterns like the DQA locus, with very few individual haplotypes. As the DQB sequences obtained here are truncated, some additional variation may exist in these putative loci.

This dataset represents the first MHC sequences retrieved from ancient camel specimens from hot and arid environments, which are notoriously the most unfavorable for the survival of DNA [76]. Although fragmentary at this stage, the data showed that some DRA haplotypes have been maintained over time.
