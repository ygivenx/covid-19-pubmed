            "text": "An acute peripheral immune response can be widely systemic, affecting a variety of tissues and organ systems, although the tissue-specific response may vary greatly [1]. For example, peripheral immune stimulation has been shown to influence neuroinflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS) [2, 3]. Specific effects seen in the brain following peripheral immune challenge include global changes in expression of interferon response genes [4] as well as alterations in cell-specific transcriptional programming, particularly in microglia [5, 6]. These transcriptional alterations of neuroimmune signaling in early life are hypothesized to result in developmental priming, potentially leading to enduring consequences in response to later life exposures (reviewed in [7, 8]). Therefore, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between peripheral inflammation and early postnatal CNS response, to evaluate the risk factors in early life as well as identify strategies to limit adverse effects.",

            "text": "Under physiologic conditions, immune signaling within the CNS is coordinated primarily by resident cells such as microglia, astrocytes, and mast cells due to tightly regulated infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the brain parenchyma [9, 10]. When activated, these resident immune cells secrete a range of cytokines, chemokines, and other regulatory factors that drive neuroinflammatory responses and contribute to normal neurodevelopment and functional homeostasis [11, 12]. Integration of systemic immune signals by CNS-resident cells may occur via coordinated signaling through the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [13], trafficking and effector functions of immune cells within the meninges [14], and gut microbe-mediated mechanisms [15]. Each of these systems undergoes overlapping periods of development and refinement during the first few weeks following birth. Therefore, immune activation during these critical periods of development can have broad implications on neurodevelopment and neural function later in life.",

            "text": "In this study, we focused on understanding the relationship between the peripheral immune system and developing CNS by evaluating the respective immune responses to an acute peripheral, mixed immune challenge at an early postnatal time point. To do this, we challenged rats with either a mix of bacterial and viral components in adjuvant, adjuvant alone, or saline on postnatal day 10 (P10). The time point of P10 was chosen for exposure as it roughly translates to the first year of life in humans [16, 17] and represents an age of peak brain growth in rats [18]. We then evaluated the subsequent peripheral and CNS immune response 2 and 5 days later to compare early vs. late post-challenge immune responses. As a readout, we analyzed cytokine and chemokine levels in the serum as well as cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar lysates. Additionally, we assessed the numbers and activation profiles of microglia and astrocytes within the cortex and hippocampus. Given the inherent heterogeneity in the immune response due to genetic background and sex [19, 20], an additional aim of the study was to compare the CNS and peripheral immune response following immune challenge in male and female Lewis and Brown Norway (BN) rats. These strains of rats were chosen as they exhibit immune response skewing, with Lewis rats skewing toward a T helper (Th) 1 cell (cellular, proinflammatory) response and BN rats skewing toward a Th2 (humoral, regulatory) response [21, 22]. While evidence exists suggesting sex-specific differences in CNS immune responsiveness during early postnatal development [23], the influence of genetic background on sex-specific immune responses is not as well documented. Therefore, a primary goal of this study was to identify potential differences in the region-specific CNS immune response in neonatal rats to a peripheral mixed immune challenge in the context of sex and genetic background.",

The following cytokines and chemokines were measured: granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1), IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Briefly, lyophilized rat cytokine standards were first reconstituted with either cell lysis buffer (brain samples) or the kit-provided standard diluent (serum samples), and a standard dilution series was made. Homogenized brain samples were run in duplicate at 1 mg/mL, whereas serum samples were run neat. Fifty microliters of samples, standards, and corresponding buffer blanks were incubated on a plate shaker at room temperature (RT) with antibody-coupled magnetic beads for 1 h. After a series of washes, biotinylated detection antibodies were added and incubated on a shaker at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was detected by the addition of streptavidin-phycoerythrin following a wash step and incubated on a plate shaker at room temperature for 10 min. Following a repeat of the washing step, beads were re-suspended in assay buffer for 30 s at room temperature on the plate shaker. Plates were read on a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with a five-parameter model used to calculate final concentrations and values (expressed in pg/mL). Reference samples were run on each plate to determine assay consistency. All wash steps were performed at room temperature using a Bio-Plex handheld magnetic washer (Bio-Rad Laboratories).",

Exploratory analysis indicated that a natural logarithmic transformation was needed for all outcomes other than colocalization to stabilize the variance and meet the underlying assumptions of the mixed-effects models. Due to zeroes for some outcomes, all values in those outcomes were shifted by 0.1 prior to taking the natural logarithm. Due to a high percentage of zeroes, colocalization was dichotomized to 0 or 1 (colocalization > 0) and a repeated measures logistic regression model was used.

Consistent with the age of the rat pups, the effect of treatment on the serum cytokine response was relatively mild (Additional file 2: Figure S2A and Additional file 3: Figure S3A). Over half of the serum samples had levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 below the LOD, and these cytokines were therefore excluded from further analysis. For serum analytes that were above the LOD and were found to be differentially regulated in response to treatment, effects were broadly similar across strains with some sex-specific skewing. For GM-CSF, significant main effects of treatment were seen in both Lewis and BN rat strains (Additional file 2: Figure S2A). Specifically, post hoc testing revealed sex-dependent increases in the level of GM-CSF in serum 5 days post-challenge in males of both strains (Lewis, p < 0.001; BN, p = 0.005; Fig. 2a), with significant increases also seen under adjuvant conditions in male Lewis rats (p = 0.001). In contrast, female BN rats exhibited significant increases in GM-CSF in response to adjuvant treatment compared to saline controls at the same time point (p < 0.001; Fig. 2a). Of note, a significantly higher level of GM-CSF was seen under adjuvant conditions compared to immune challenge in female BN rats at 5 days post-challenge (Fig. 2a). However, this was the only instance of such a finding in the study and is likely due to several serum GM-CSF values falling below the level of detection in these animals. A main effect of treatment was observed in the level of the chemokine MCP-1 in both Lewis and BN rats (Additional file 2: Figure S2A). Higher levels of MCP-1 were detected under adjuvant-only conditions at 5 days post-challenge in female BN rats (p = 0.02) and at 2 days post-challenge in female Lewis rats (p = 0.001), or 2 days following mixed immune challenge in Lewis males (p = 0.016; Fig. 2b).\n",

In cortical lysates from both strains, a main effect of treatment was observed for all canonical Th-type cytokines measured (Additional file 2: Figure S2B). Interestingly, the level of IFN-\u03b3 (a major Th1 cytokine) in the cortex following mixed immune challenge was significantly elevated in males of both strains (p < 0.001), with similar effects at 2 and 5 days post-challenge (Fig. 4a). In female rats of either strain, cortical IFN-\u03b3 levels were significantly increased at 5 days (p < 0.01) but not at 2 days post-challenge (Fig. 4a). In contrast to the cortical response, peripheral immune challenge had little or no significant effect on IFN-\u03b3 levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum of Lewis or BN rats (Additional file 3: Figures S3C and D). Striking strain and sex differences were seen in the response to immune challenge in cortical levels of IL-4, an indicator of Th2-type responses. Specifically, peripheral immune challenge significantly increased cortical IL-4 levels in female Lewis rats at 2 days (p = 0.003) and 5 days (p < 0.001) post-challenge, while exposure to adjuvant-only treatment only resulted in elevated cortical IL-4 levels at 5 days post-exposure (p < 0.001; Fig. 4b). In contrast, compared to saline controls, cortical IL-4 levels were significantly decreased in female BN rats in response to mixed immune challenge (p < 0.01) or adjuvant (p < 0.01), or unchanged in male rats of either strain (Fig. 4b; Additional file 3: Figure S3B). Coincident with these responses, post hoc analysis revealed a lack of effect of either immune challenge or adjuvant-only on IL-17 levels in the BN rat cortex at both 2 and 5 days post-challenge. However, cortical IL-17 levels were significantly elevated compared to controls in response to mixed immune challenge in male Lewis rats (p < 0.001) and in response to either mixed immune (p < 0.05) or adjuvant treatment (p < 0.05) in female Lewis rats (Fig. 4c). Cortical IL-10 levels were similar between strains, although significantly increased levels of IL-10 in response to experimental manipulation were seen only in male rats, with no apparent effects in females (Fig. 4d). Data for cortical IL-17 and IL-10 levels were collapsed between day of collection due to minimal differences seen for those two analytes over time (Additional file 3: Figure S3B).\n",

Despite this, knowledge regarding the CNS response to a peripheral immune challenge during early postnatal development is limited in scope. Numerous studies have investigated perinatal immune signaling and CNS development using iterations of the maternal immune activation (MIA) paradigm (reviewed in [31]). This is likely due to the growing body of literature on the topic, clinical relevance, and thorough characterization of the methodology [32]. Although, recent research has suggested, perhaps unsurprisingly, that MIA-induced effects on brain circuit-specific function are dissociable from those effects induced by early postnatal immune challenge, with contrasting results on glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling respectively [33]. Therefore, it is of value to develop a deeper knowledge regarding how acute peripheral immune stimulation, postnatally, may influence the production of immune effector molecules and activation of glial cells in the CNS. The latter point is particularly important as altered neural function due to perinatal immune activation may depend partly on early glial priming, contributing to long-term functional alterations in these cells [5, 6, 30].",

Prior studies comparing the timeline of rat and human development suggest that preweaning ages in rats correspond to roughly the first year of life in humans [16, 17]. Therefore, to mirror the immune challenges a human infant may face in early life, we chose to expose rats on P10\u2014a time of early postnatal development when hematopoiesis is shifted from the fetal liver and spleen to the bone marrow, and the lymphoid architecture begins to take shape [34]. Furthermore, in rodent development, P10 is a time shortly after the early critical period for sexual differentiation of the brain [35] and represents an age of peak brain growth in rats [18]. These factors are important for proper interpretation of sex- and age-specific comparisons in this study.",

These time points were chosen to correspond to an early stage, 2 days post-exposure, where innate immune mechanisms would be dominant, and at a later stage, 5 days post-exposure, where adaptive immune responses would potentially be active [36]. Importantly, development of the adaptive immune system in rodents is similar to humans in that perinatal lymphocyte numbers and proliferative responses in lymphoid organs are low [37]. Further evidence suggests that germinal center formation is absent at P10 in rats and, subsequently, they are thought to be incapable of mounting a proper primary immune response [38]. Therefore, it is not surprising that many cytokine levels were below the level of detection in the peripheral blood. However, it is notable that the cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 were detectable in serum, albeit with no significant differences between experimental groups or rat strain. Relevant here, and known to be similar between species, evidence shows that early postnatal Th-type responses in rats and other mammals are skewed toward Th2 [39, 40]. Furthermore, studies in neonatal mice using exposure to various inoculation components resulted in a decreased IgG (immunoglobulin G) 2a/IgG1 ratio compared to similarly exposed adult animals [41]. These data support a bias of a Th2-type versus Th1-type response during the neonatal period. The inability to detect serum IFN-\u03b3 in our samples while observing measurable IL-4 and IL-10 levels may lend further credence to this potential skewing.",

            "text": "In contrast to the modest peripheral response, the cytokine and chemokine responses within the CNS were significantly more robust, with the most dramatic effects noted in the cortex. While the cytokines IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6 were not detectable in the serum, they were markedly elevated in the brains of rats of both strains following the peripheral immune stimulation or adjuvant-only exposure, compared to saline control animals. Of importance, IL-1 and IL-6 are known to modulate glial responsiveness and are suggested to be crucial for glial proliferation and the release of important trophic factors to support brain plasticity [42, 43]. These current data may support this finding, as male BN rats, which exhibited no significant differences in IL-1 or IL-6 levels in the hippocampus 5 days post-treatment, also exhibited no difference in the number of GFAP immunopositive cells in the same region at the same time point in these animals. Whereas, at other time points and between sexes, there were significant differences in relevant cytokine levels and GFAP immunopositive cell numbers. It is important to note that the relationships described here and elsewhere regarding glial activation and cytokine levels are partly speculative as direct comparisons between GFAP or IBA-1 reactivity and specific cytokines were not conducted due to the large number of groups already being compared. Another innate cytokine significantly upregulated in the brain within the majority of treatment groups was GM-CSF, long known as a regulator of macrophage differentiation and more recently believed to play a role in myeloid cell to lymphocyte communication [44, 45]. This may suggest expansion or activation of the resident macrophage population. However, no significant differences in the number of IBA-1 immunoreactive cells were noted between experimental conditions and among different brain regions in Lewis rats, whereas significant decreases in IBA-1 immunopositive cell numbers were observed in the cortex and hippocampus of BN rats, with the exception of female BN rats exposed to mixed immune challenge. MCP-1, a chemokine important for glial differentiation and motility [46], was also significantly elevated in response to treatment. However, the MCP-1 response was sex and strain-specific, with no observable relationship to changes in GFAP or IBA-1 immunostaining. Our findings that GM-CSF and MCP-1 levels did not appear to relate to the immunohistochemical results of CNS cellular immune activation are surprising due to their putative role in potentiating glial responses [47]. Possible explanations for this discrepancy could be the developmental stage of the animals at the time of exposure and sample collection, or that these molecules may act as signals to recruit other immune cells to the CNS compartment. As limitations in this study, we did not investigate the possibility of peripheral immune cell infiltration in the brain, blood-brain barrier permeability, or the cellular source of the cytokines/chemokines. These aspects are certainly important to determine mechanistic aspects of the immune dysregulation seen but were outside the scope of the initial study aims and are definite points for future investigation.",

This result appeared across the brain regions surveyed, with some variation at the level of single analytes. For example, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 were detected at surprisingly high levels throughout the brain at baseline, whereas levels of IL-6 were robust in the hippocampus and cerebellum, yet barely detectable in the cortex. These findings corroborate previously published data also observing appreciable levels of cytokines across brain regions at baseline during early postnatal development and specifically validate outcomes seen in our dataset such as lower IFN-\u03b3 in the cortex compared to the hippocampus in the second postnatal week [48]. While of interest, the biologic significance behind this brain region-specific difference in IFN-\u03b3 and other cytokines does not seem to be evident in the existing literature and will be important for further study. Additionally, our study suggests that cytokine levels at baseline appear to vary widely as a function of sex or strain. These data strongly support previous findings that immune molecule signaling in the CNS is active during normal neurodevelopment [49] and suggest consideration of sex and strain differences in the design of neuroimmunological experiments.",

            "text": "While innate-like cytokines and chemokines within the CNS showed broadly similar patterns across strain and sex, CNS Th-type cytokine responses varied greatly between Lewis and BN rats. These two rat strains were chosen for comparison due to previous knowledge of the susceptibility or resistance of either strain to the development of Th-subset specific disorders [50, 51]. However, the basis of this skewing may not only involve the CD4+ T cell compartment, but also CD8+ T cells and mast cells [21, 52, 53]. Given these findings, it may be anticipated that this immune response skewing could extend to the CNS as well. Using IFN-\u03b3 as a crude marker of a Th1-type response, our results suggest that these two strains do not differ greatly in Th1-type responses within the CNS. However, when evaluating IL-4 levels as a readout of a Th2-type response, the results were dramatically different. In the cortex, where the most robust cytokine responses were noted, female Lewis rats exhibited elevated levels of IL-4 in response to mixed immune challenge or adjuvant, whereas a significant decrease in IL-4 was noted in female BN rats under the same treatment conditions. No significant treatment-related differences in the level of IL-4 were observed in male rats of either strain. These results seem in opposition of what might be expected with Lewis rats exhibiting a greater IL-4 response and BN rats showing no changes or decreases in IL-4 levels in cortical lysates. However, when considering that we also observed sex and strain differences in other Th-subtype cytokines, this outcome suggests several non-mutually exclusive possibilities. First, as supported by the current study, the CNS cytokine response is likely different than the concomitant peripheral immune response. Second, it could be that genetic immune skewing between Lewis and BN strains cannot be classified into a defined Th-subset category. Finally, sex may be a greater determinant than genetic background when considering CNS immune skewing. Inherent differences in Th1/Th2 skewing between sexes have been previously proposed, with females skewed toward a Th2 dominant response [54]. Our data are consistent with this last point, at least with regard to IL-4 levels in the CNS.",

Additionally, under many conditions, IL-4 responses are characterized as anti-inflammatory in nature and may act as a growth or repair responses in the brain [56, 57].

Additionally, no significant effects were noted upon assessment of IBA-1 colocalization with CD68. This is interesting as we saw a robust increase in GFAP immunopositive cells and expression levels across most conditions. The reasoning for this could lie once again in the developmental time period of exposure, as microglia undergo distinctive rounds of maturation during the perinatal period [58, 59]. In support of this reasoning, recent work has demonstrated that peripheral LPS challenge in P14 mice resulted in a significant increase in GFAP but not IBA-1 reactivity in the hippocampus [60]. More importantly, opposite effects were observed when adult animals were subjected to the same treatment, with pronounced increases in IBA-1 reactivity but not GFAP reactivity [60]. Furthermore, a separate group found that glial activation occurred sequentially in response to a systemic immune challenge, with microglial activation occurring shortly after exposure and induction of astrocytic activation occurring in a delayed manner [61]. These studies suggest that glial activation is tightly regulated both temporally and spatially.",

            "text": "The current study supports existing evidence that immune signaling molecules are highly upregulated in the brain following a peripheral immune challenge. Additionally, it emphasizes the influence of factors such as sex and genetic background on the cytokine and chemokine response, as well as astrogliosis and microgliosis within the brain. Interestingly, we observed high concentrations of various cytokines in the CNS under baseline conditions, the levels of which also varied significantly depending on strain, sex, and brain region. While this study provides a thorough characterization of the CNS immune response to a peripheral immune challenge, taking into account a broad number of factors, further study is needed to provide mechanistic support for how this cytokine/chemokine signaling and cellular activation may shape brain development.",
