While the correlates of immune protection are still only vaguely defined, it is now generally recognized that an effective HIV-1 vaccine must elicit strong T-cell responses as well as neutralizing antibody [1]\u2013[4]. It has been postulated that the immunogenicity of a protein antigen can be enhanced by targeting the antigen to the major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC II) processing compartment of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). One of the approaches is the use of the lysosomal associated membrane protein\u20131 (LAMP) as a LAMP/antigen chimera to target endogenous antigens to the MHC II processing compartment [5]\u2013[10]. Many laboratories have reported that LAMP targeting can greatly enhance the immune responses against a number of antigens, including HPV-16- E7 and E6 proteins; human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTert); West Nile virus preM-E; the thyroid hormone receptor (TSHR); HIV-1 Gag, Env gp120, Env gp160, and Nef; human melanosomal antigen (MAGE-3); dengue 2 preM-E; listeriolysin O; and SARS coronavirus N protein [11]\u2013[24].",

These observations in mice led us to investigate the immunogenicity of a naked DNA encoding the HIV-1 LAMP/gag antigen formulation in Rhesus macaques, a relevant animal model for testing HIV vaccines for potential use in humans. We found that immunization of these primates with a human LAMP/gag (hLAMP/gag) DNA vaccine promoted a humoral and cellular immune response, which was associated with a sustained activation of B-lymphocytes as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, Gag-specific T cells were detected after only two immunizations and were further expanded by booster injections of hLAMP/gag chimera. These results substantiate the usefulness of the LAMP vaccination strategy as a means of effectively eliciting T- and B-cell responses to naked DNA immunization of Rhesus macaques.",

ELISPOT assays to quantify the IFN-\u03b3+-secreting cells present in the macaque PBMCs were independently performed at the Southern Research Center and The Johns Hopkins University laboratories. Three different forms of the Gag protein antigen were used to stimulate the PBMCs: HIV rGag and 15- and 20-aa peptide pools that encompass the entire Gag sequence. PBMCs stimulated with all the three formulations of Gag antigen presented similar numbers of IFN-\u03b3+ SFCs. These ELISPOT results are presented as the average of the results obtained with the three Gag preparations at the two laboratories. The magnitude of the vaccine-induced T-cell responses varied from macaque to macaque; however, in every case, IFN-\u03b3 secretion was detected after the second immunization at week 8, reached the highest level of 600 to 1200 SFC/106 cells at week 18 following the third immunization, and declined gradually until further immunizations were given at weeks 22 and 38 (Figure 4). These studies included an analysis of the relative efficiency of the 15- or 20-aa peptides in stimulating T-cell responses in vitro, and we observed that PBMCs of all the five immunized macaques stimulated with the 15- and 20-aa Gag peptide pools separately, showed no significant difference in the IFN-\u03b3 response (Figure 5). CD4+-specific responses were also studied by ELISPOT analyses with CD8+-depleted PBMC stimulated with rGag. All five macaques showed a response in the range of 200\u20131000 IFN-\u03b3+ SFC/106 CD8+-depleted cells, indicating a potent CD4+-mediated response (Figure 6).",

Similar findings have been obtained with the five immunized macaques, each of which showed strong humoral immune responses (Figure 8). The strength of these responses by the individual macaques followed the same pattern as the T-cell responses. High anti-gag IgG antibody titers were present in serum after immunization with hLAMP/gag, indicating effective priming. Four of the five vaccinated macaques (#3119, 3162, 3159 and 3117) developed antibodies against HIV-1 after the second immunization and high antibody titers were achieved by these four macaques following the third DNA immunization at week 14. The remaining macaque (#3125), which showed the weakest T-cell response, also elicited a relatively weak antibody response as compared to the other 4 macaques (Figure 8A). The third DNA immunization worked as a booster for all the macaques, and antibody titers reached their highest values after the 5th injection (at week 38). The end-dilution titers of the IgG antibodies achieved after four hLAMP/gag immunizations ranged from 2,700 to 24,300 (Figure 8B).",

Most naked DNA vaccines have produced sub-optimal immune responses, even with repeated boosting, with only moderate T-cell responses when compared to live-attenuated virus or recombinant virus vaccines and very low or no humoral responses. In contrast, hLAMP/gag DNA immunization elicited potent CD4+ T-cell as well as Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in macaques after only a few DNA immunizations. The responses included highly significant IgG antibody titers after two DNA immunizations in four of the five immunized macaques and IgA responses in serum and nasal washes.

Moreover, others have shown that human dendritic cells transfected with LAMP-targeted HIV nef are able to induce the activation of an increased repertoire of T-cells isolated from infected patients [26]. In this study, each of the four macaques tested, produced Gag-specific IFN-\u03b3+ responses to many Gag 15-aa peptide pools, indicating a broad range of T-cell responses. A question that remains to be investigated is whether this result reflects a true increase in the number of new epitopes being recognized as a result of hLAMP/gag administration or whether the ability of hLAMP/gag to increase the overall magnitude of the cellular immune response simply enhances our ability to detect epitopes that would otherwise have been below the limit of detection.",

The prime-boost formulations have been shown to induce strong cellular immune responses and protection in malaria [38]\u2013[39] and SIVmac [40]\u2013[41] models. Moreover, the DNA prime and viral boost approach has been shown to be important in increasing the breadth of the response repertoire of viral vector vaccines [42], thereby contributing to the overall immunological protection. There is growing consensus that plasmid DNA represents a particularly good prime immunogen. Therefore, considerable work is now being done to explore the use of bimodal vaccine regimens in which the plasmid DNA is used to prime the immune response and a live recombinant vector is used to boost that immunity [43]. These studies collectively suggest that more work is needed before a DNA approach alone or a DNA prime followed by a viral vector boost is able to completely control the pathogenic challenge in these model systems. A recent report has shown consistent and strong CTL responses to Gag in macaques immunized with DNA_CRL 1005-adjuvant Gag plasmids and boosted with rAd5 encoding gag [44]. The studies have established that a significant percentage of humans respond to both the DNA and adenovirus approaches, and more evaluation of further potent DNA vaccines is clearly warranted.",
