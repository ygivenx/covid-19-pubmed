In General, the biological function of a protein is determined by its three dimensional structure which is dependent on the linear sequence of amino acids. Rigden [1] presented that one of the fundamental principles of molecular biology is that proteins having similar sequences possess similar functions. Up to now, lots of methods have been proposed for the similarity analysis of protein sequences, among which the graphical representation of protein sequences is one of the most used and effective strategies [2\u201321].",

            "text": "The chaos game representation (CGR) based on an iterative function system was firstly proposed for the representation of DNA sequences by Jeffrey in 1990 [22]. The Jeffrey\u2019s CGR is drawn within a quadrate with four vertices referring to nucleotides A, C, G and T. The first point is placed halfway between the center of the quadrate and the vertex corresponding to the first nucleotide of the sequence. The i-th (i > 1) point is placed halfway between the (i-1)-th point and the vertex corresponding to the i-th nucleotide. Being capable of discovering the inner pattern of gene sequences, CGR has been widely used in the investigation of DNA sequences [23\u201328]. Encouraged by the CGR of DNA sequences, the CGR of protein sequences has also been extensively studied by many researchers. Fisher et al. [29] first proposed an improved CGR of protein sequences, which was produced in a 20-side regular polygon with 20-vertices representing 20 kinds of amino acid. Randi\u0107 et al. [30] constructed the CGR of protein sequences in the interior of a unit circle, on the circumference of which 20 amino acids are located uniformly according to the alphabet order of their three letter codes.",

            "text": "Amino acids themselves have physicochemical properties, which are important for protein structures, functions and protein-protein interactions and have strong effects on the pattern of protein evolution. Therefore, physicochemical properties of amino acids have been widely used in protein sequence studies, such as similarity analysis of protein sequences, prediction of protein subcellular localization and protein structural class prediction [2\u201315, 18\u201320, 31\u201338]. In [39], Randi\u0107 mentioned that ordering amino acids based on their physicochemical properties may offer better insights in comparative studies of proteins than representations of proteins based on alphabetical ordering of amino acids, which is essentially equivalent to random ordering. Following Randi\u0107\u2019s approach, He et al. [31, 40] proposed some different cyclic orders for the 20 amino acids to introduce the CGRs of protein sequences based on the physicochemical properties of amino acids. We denote the above CGRs by 20-CGR as 20 kinds of letters are used to represent protein sequences. Basu et al. [41] used a 12-sided regular polygon to generate the 12-CGR of protein sequences, each vertex of which represents a group of amino acids based on the conservative substitutions. Later Yu et al. [32] and Manikandakumar et al. [33] proposed 4-CGR, 5-CGR and 6-CGR for protein sequences, in which 4, 5 and 6 kinds of letters were used to represent protein sequences, respectively. In fact, using reduced amino acid alphabet to represent a protein sequence would easily result in loss of sequence information, since the amino acids belonging to the same group are considered identical.",

            "text": "So far, CGR method has achieved many applications in the studies of bioinformatics. The key issue in the application of CGR is to extract as many useful features as possible from CGR and several studies showed that those extracted features plays important roles in protein studies [25\u201328, 31, 34\u201338, 40\u201342]. One of the most frequently used feature extraction methods is the so-called FCGR, in which the CGR image is split into small grids and the frequencies of points falling into each grid are taken as the feature of the corresponding protein sequence. For example, in [34\u201338, 41], the CGR image of a protein sequence was split into 24 grids, and the frequencies of points falling into 24 grids are counted and taken as the numerical characteristics of the protein sequence. Under this procedure, a protein sequence can be converted into a 24-dimensional vector. Although FCGR method could effectively extract useful information from CGR, however, it loses the distribution information of the points in each grid, which is proved of great importance in this paper.",

Antifreeze proteins are a class of proteins produced by certain vertebrates, plants, fungi and bacteria that permit their survival in subzero environments by binding to small ice crystals to inhibit growth and recrystallization of ice. The 27 AFPs were selected from Choristoneura fumiferana (CF), Tenebrio molitor (TM), Hypogastrura harveyi (HH), Dorcus curvidens binodulosus (DCB), Microdera dzhungarica punctipennis (MDP) and Dendroides Canadensis (DC), whose taxonomic information and accession numbers are provided in Additional file 1: Table S4. After feature extractions of the 27 AFPs by DCGR, the standardized Euclidean distance was used to calculate the distance matrix, and the phylogenetic tree of the 27 AFPs was constructed in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5, it clearly shows that the AFPs of the same species are accurately grouped together. In addition, the HH protein has a far relationship with each of the other 26 AFPs, which is consistent with the result in [56]. However, all the other compared methods [43, 52, 55] including ClustalW cannot accurately group all the proteins into respective taxonomic classes. The phylogenetic trees constructed by these methods have been shown in Additional file 1: Figures S18-S21. For example, ClustalW erroneously divided the TM proteins into two separate groups, while the methods in [43, 52, 55] failed separating the HH protein from the other ones.",
