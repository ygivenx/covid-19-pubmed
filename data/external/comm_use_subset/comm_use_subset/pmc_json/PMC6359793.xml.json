            "text": "The development of an adaptive immune response to Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) depends on both humoral and cellular components [1]. The innate immune system is the first mechanism of defence to prevent viral invasion and replication and influences the adaptive response of the immune system. Adequate early activation of the innate immune system is critical to initiate generation of protective adaptive immunity to achieve complete viral clearance [2]. However, PRRSV induces a slow and weak innate response [1]. The quantities of important cytokines secreted in pigs infected by PRRSV, like IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, appeared to be significantly lower than in pigs infected with Influenza A virus or Porcine respiratory coronavirus [3\u20135]. The development of neutralising antibodies (NA) is also known to occur later in the course of the infection although non-neutralising antibodies appear by 7\u201314 days post-inoculation [6]. In that way, both humoral and cell-mediated specific immunity are delayed, compromising clearance of the virus [7].",

Passive transfer of NA to pregnant sows (titres 1/16) can protect them against reproductive failure by blocking transplacental infection [8]. Using the same antibody transfer system, a titre of 1/8 or higher protected piglets against the development of viraemia, with sterilising immunity being obtained at titres of 1/32 [9]. These results suggest that a vaccine capable of inducing NA titres of 1/32 against a given PRRSV strain should prevent the clinical disease produced by it and could be an important tool in the control of PRRSV [10]. It has to be taken into account, however, that these studies used a homologous challenge model. Despite the significant role that NAs seem to play in protection, their effectiveness might be limited against heterologous isolates, as demonstrated by the limited ability of PRRSV hyperimmune sera to effectively neutralise a variety of heterologous strains [11].",

One day old piglets were selected as they represent the \u201cworse-case scenario\u201d (youngest pigs) allowed by the indications of the vaccine used. Two routes of vaccine administration, intramuscular (IM) and intranasal (IN), were evaluated. Challenge was delayed until 18 weeks after vaccination to ensure satisfactory duration of immunity. Innate immunity was measured by evaluating the level of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1), humoral immunity by measuring the development of NA, and cell-mediated immunity by evaluating the development of IFN-\u03b3- secreting cells.",

Animals were housed by treatment with one pen per treatment in the vaccination phase. Prior to challenge, animals were re-housed and comingled in one room. At 18 weeks post-vaccination (126 days), pigs were challenged IN with the PRRSV-1 isolate Olot/91. Levels of cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), number of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) secreting cells, and levels of NA to the vaccine strain, were measured at different time points after vaccination, and 6 days after challenge. Also, PRRSV viraemia and nasal shedding were determined by RT-qPCR 1 day prior to challenge and at days 3, 6, 8 and 10 after challenge. Ten days post-challenge, pigs were euthanised.",

It has been hypothesised that in some strains of PRRSV the induction of IL-10 pushes the immune response towards a relatively ineffective induction of IFN-\u03b3 specific response [19]. In this study, the induction of detectable levels of IL-10 was rare, both after vaccination and after challenge. During the post-vaccination phase, a single pig (from the IN-vaccinated group) showed induction of a low level of IL-10 (10.9 pg/mL). After challenge with the Olot/91 strain, four pigs were positive for IL-10 with levels up to 346.6 pg/mL. The near absence of measurable IL-10 induction by the vaccine virus indicates that vaccination did not induce any significant response attributable to this regulatory cytokine, either in the period of innate response (day 3) or in later stages of the trial. IL-10 mediated immunomodulation/ immune dysfunction was not a general feature of this vaccine strain, as demonstrated by induction of a high number of IFN-\u03b3-SC. This is a positive feature of the vaccine strain, since IL-10 has been related to an inhibition of the development of an effective immune response against PRRSV [10].",

In this study IL-8 was detected in only two pigs following vaccination, and not at all in the non-vaccinated group, suggesting that the vaccine did not generate intense inflammatory reactions. Young pigs have a reduced ability to produce IL-8 in response to an immune stimulation, compared to adults [13]. However, IL-8 was detected in the majority of vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs after challenge, indicating that the ability of pigs to produce IL-8 was not impaired after challenge. There were no significant differences between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. The lack of induction of this pro-inflammatory cytokine is consistent with the good safety profile of the vaccine (no systemic or local reactions observed after vaccination; data not shown).",

In addition, IFN-\u03b1 serves as an important link between innate and adaptive immunity, and can enhance the development of a strong T helper type 1 (Th1) inflammatory response [1]. IFN-\u03b1 induction has been reported to be weak or absent for some PRRSV strains. The active inhibition of IFN-\u03b1 production, and inhibition of various IFN-induced cellular gene products, has been attributed to specific viral proteins and implicated as a primary cause of the impaired immune responses to the virus [1, 24]. In this study, IFN-\u03b1 was detected in all vaccinated pigs, regardless of route. IFN-\u03b1 levels increased between days 3 and 7 following vaccination, while remaining low in the non-vaccinated control group. These results would be consistent with the development of antiviral responses. Consistent induction of IFN-\u03b1 secretion shortly after vaccination indicates the potential for development of an effective Th1 adaptive immune response dominated by IFN-\u03b3, which was demonstrated by frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-SC in response to the virus well above 100 per million.",

Specifically, it was noted that those animals having a high NA titre at challenge were able to clear viraemia in 6\u20138 days, or even did not become viraemic. One IM-vaccinated animal with a low NA titre at challenge did not become viraemic, but had the highest IFN-\u03b3 response. NA and IFN-\u03b3 responses were measured against the vaccine strain only. Results would likely be different (lower) against a heterologous virus, such as the challenge virus used in this study. However, it is important to establish homologous baseline performance of the vaccine before considering the effects on heterologous cross-reaction on these immunoassays. The ability of the vaccine to protect against this heterologous challenge virus is evident from the viraemia results.
