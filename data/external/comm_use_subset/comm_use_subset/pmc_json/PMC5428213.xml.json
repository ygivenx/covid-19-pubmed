The Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) was identified in mosquitoes, and no evidence of vertebrate infection by this virus has been detected. NDiV was found to be a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA ([+]ssRNA) virus. The 20,192 nucleotide (nt)-long genome contains two major open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two proteins (pp1a and pp1ab, respectively) using a ribosomal frame shift mechanism. The intact NDiV virion exhibited a spherical form with a diameter of 60\u201380 nm2. The structure, replication and transcription patterns of the viral genome were similar to those of coronaviruses in the order Nidovirales. A phylogenetic analysis showed that NDiV is distantly related to coronaviruses, indicating that this virus represents a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.",

Thus, it is most frequently detected in Culex mosquitoes, particularly C. pipiens quinquefasciatus, indicating that Culex mosquitoes are probably the major host of NDiV in nature. An analysis of 39 CavV isolates from different habitat types along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient showed an increase in virus prevalence from natural to modified habitat types10. The data for CavV isolates support the hypothesis that disturbed habitats, particularly human settlements, support the proliferation of endemic viruses more efficiently than undisturbed primary forest. As in our study, NDiV-positive adult mosquitoes were also collected in or near areas of human habitation in the USA, Indonesia and Vietnam. The increasing trend of NDiV movement from natural to modified habitat types, similar to CavV of the same species, Alphamesonivirus 1, requires further confirmation based on statistical evidence obtained by expanding the types of sites sampled and increasing the number of mosquito samples.",

Furthermore, the replication of NDiV was found to occur mainly in the cytoplasm of host cells2. Our results also showed that the replication of NDiV isolated in China occurred in the cytoplasm of host cells rather than in cytoplasts. The vacuoles of infected cells in our study appeared similar to those described by Nga2, with the accumulation of viral nucleocapsid-like particles and individual spherical nucleocapsid-like particles with electron-dense interiors containing the viral genetic material observed in the cytoplasm. This indicates that the morphology of nucleocapsid-like particles of NDiV in C6/36 cell cytoplasm from the two areas is identical. Alphamesonivirus 1, as the type species of Alphamesonvirus (the new genus of Mesoniviridae), was proposed to recognize NDiV and CavV. The morphology of NDiV virions from China and Vietnam appeared similar in electron microscopy after negative staining. These virions were of homogeneous spherical shape and appeared to contain very short, spike-like projections. The virions of CavV were typical CoV-like virions with rod-shaped surface projections. However, there were significant differences in the appearance of the spike proteins of the two viruses, and further investigations are required to understand the relationship between the efficiency of viral envelope assembly and spike proteins.",
