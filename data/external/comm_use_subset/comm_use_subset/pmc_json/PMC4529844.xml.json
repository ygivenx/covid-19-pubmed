The respiratory tract of CF patients is colonized and infected by numerous bacteria from an early age. Among cultivable pathogens, which include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, P. aeruginosa is the most prevalent pathogen in CF. In children with CF, Kosorok et al. (2001) demonstrated a longitudinal correlation between P. aeruginosa acquisition and gradual deterioration of pulmonary function. Therefore, early detection of P. aeruginosa appears crucial for maximizing the chances of efficiently controlling this pathogen, notably by early institution of anti-Pseudomonas antibiotherapy (Valerius et al. 1991).",

            "text": "Better understanding of the initial steps of P. aeruginosa infection would also help in preventing early colonization in CF airways. According to Klepac-Ceraj et al. (2010), the community composition of the CF pulmonary microbiota is a better indicator of disease progression than the presence of P. aeruginosa alone. The endogenous respiratory microbiota may modulate pathogenesis in a polymicrobial context through microbe\u2013microbe and polymicrobe\u2013host interactions (Sibley and Surette 2011). Several studies reported important differences in the structure of the respiratory microbiota between healthy subjects and patients with chronic lung diseases (Huang et al. 2010). The lung infections of CF patients are also considered as polymicrobial (Sibley and Surette 2011; Sibley et al. 2006). Recently, van der Gast et al. (2011) identified a core group dominated by P. aeruginosa and a satellite group composed of multiple microbial species, including species not routinely identified by culture and not recognized as CF pathogens. The inability of conventional infection models to detect a pathogenic response to certain microorganisms known as commensals should not mean that their potential to contribute to polymicrobial infection can be disregarded (Sibley et al. 2008). The CF lung infection model has thus moved from a classical to an ecological paradigm.",

Sputum samples were processed using the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the French guidelines (Anonyme 2010). Twenty spontaneous sputum samples (4 per patient) were collected and homogenized with an equal volume of dithiothreitol (Digest-EUR\u00ae Eurobio, Courtab\u0153uf, France) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Clinical, therapeutic and biological data were compiled such as CFTR mutation, clinical state, antibiotic treatment and P. aeruginosa status. Sputum sample quality was verified by cytological examination of fresh smears and classified according to the number of epithelial cells and leukocytes. Sputum samples were classified in three quality classes: poor quality when the number of epithelial cells (cells/field) was \u226525 and the number of leukocytes (cells/field) was \u226410; appropriate quality when the number of epithelial cells was \u226425 and the number of leukocytes (cells/field) was \u226510. The other combinations between epithelial cells and leukocytes were considered of moderate quality. All samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to DNA extraction. According to the Lee\u2019s definition of P. aeruginosa infection status (Lee et al. 2003), three patients were categorized as \u2018free\u2019 (no culture of P. aeruginosa for at least the previous year), and two patients as \u2018never\u2019 (P. aeruginosa had never been detected from sputum or cough swabs culture).

OTUs of interest were also further classified to the species level using the RDP SeqMatch tool. Prior to alpha and beta diversity analyses, the OTU table was rarefied to the smallest number of reads obtained in a sample. Alpha diversity was determined using the Shannon index, Chao-1 estimator and equitability (evenness) index. Beta diversity was assessed using the Adonis test and the Bray\u2013Curtis distance and visualized by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Diversity was also evaluated using the Simpson\u2019s diversity index (SDI) transformed with the arcsine square root. A non-parametric (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test) statistical test was applied in QIIME to test whether genera abundance was significantly associated with their associated metadata. A hierarchical ascendant classification (HAC) by Euclidean distance and an abundance heatmap were also obtained using XLstat software package (http://www.xlstat.com). The core microbiota was defined as OTUs present in at least 50 % of samples at a minimum relative abundance of 0.1 % of the total bacterial community. Sequences of the selected OTUs were aligned to the Greengenes core-set-aligned using PyNast with default parameters. The concordance between detection of P. aeruginosa using 454 pyrosequencing and culture based-method was assessed. The alignment was then filtered to remove gaps and hypervariable regions using a lane mask and a tree was generated using FastTree (Price et al. 2009). A circular phylogenetic tree was then constructed using the Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) (Letunic and Bork 2007). The sequence data were deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive (BioProject no.

The high diversity found in the present study can be explained by the young age of these patients (mean age 10 years) because microbial diversity is maximal in this age range (Cox et al. 2010).

Nine of them have been described to be the most abundant genera in healthy lungs (Wat et al. 2008). In agreement with previous studies, there was a large abundance of obligate anaerobes such as Veillonella and Prevotella (Tunney et al. 2008; Cheung et al. 2013), and facultative anaerobes such as Gemella, which is thought to be a biomarker for the exacerbation in CF lung (Carmody et al. 2013). OTUs corresponding to uncultivable bacteria affiliated to the TM6, TM7 and WPS-2 phyla also reported to be components of the oral microbiota (Adler et al. 2013), were present at low abundances in the sputum samples. While TM7 has already been detected in CF sputum samples (Blainey et al. 2012), this is the first time, to our knowledge, that TM6 and WPS-2 are reported in CF. The large abundance of so-called \u2018oral bacteria\u2019 in the respiratory microbiota of CF children corroborates the viewpoint that the oral cavity is a potential source of pathogens and other bacteria such as anaerobes that reach and colonize the lower airways of CF patients (Boutin et al. 2015; Rivas Caldas and Boisram\u00e9 2015). In fact, undoubtedly, upper and lower airways are interconnected and it would be interesting to determine the origin of pathogens to better understand their colonization process in CF.",

Fluctuations [6.28 log10 \u2212 7.98 log10] were observed in biomass abundance but without any impact on microbial community structure (Adonis: p = 0.3946, R2 = 0.054), which is in contrast with a previous study suggesting a positive correlation between an increased microbial colonization and a decreased microbial diversity (Boutin et al. 2015). Those differences might be explained by the difference in the microbiological features of the CF cohort as part of the cohort explored by Boutin et al.

            "text": "Along with the early P. aeruginosa colonization process, nine OTUs were considered persistent i.e., present at high relative abundance in all samples. They comprised six genera, including three obligate anaerobes (Veillonella, Actinomyces and Prevotella), and three facultative anaerobes (Haemophilus, Granulicatella and Streptococcus) (Fig. 3) not presently assessed on SOP, except for Haemophilus spp. The genera Streptococcus comprised S. mitis, S. anginosus (formerly called S. milleri group) and S. salivarius groups. Anaerobes undoubtedly play a major role in the pathophysiology in CF patients because they are involved in inflammation, infection and lung function (Tunney et al. 2008; O\u2019Neill et al. 2015). In the present study, the issue was to know whether P. aeruginosa implantation was subsequent to a proliferation of anaerobes, or the contrary (chicken-and-egg problem). As the same anaerobic genera were detected in patients initially classified as \u2018never\u2019, which became P. aeruginosa-positive a few months later, this might suggest that anaerobes do not impede implantation of P. aeruginosa. Indeed, mass-DNA sequencing revealed that, besides the well-known lung pathogens, a core microbiota including four persistent anaerobes genera (Veillonella, Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Prevotella) exists and is common to pulmonary diseases (Cheung et al. 2013). Rogers et al. (2015) recently described the \u2018like begets like\u2019 phenomenon, whereby most dominant pathogens in microbiota are determinant for the implantation of P. aeruginosa. The role of these four genera as potential enhancers of P. aeruginosa colonization remains to be clearly demonstrated.",

The difference in bacterial density and in the number of reads of P. aeruginosa between \u2018never\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 patients was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) (Additional file 1: Table S1). Thus, bacterial density did not appear to be a potential marker of P. aeruginosa implantation. Similarly, Shannon\u2019s index and equitability were not significantly different between \u2018free\u2019 and \u2018never\u2019 CF patients. Conversely, richness was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in \u2018never\u2019 [Chao-1: 79.8 (72.03\u201387.61); observed species: 71.6 (63.85\u201379.43)] than in \u2018free\u2019 patients [Chao-1: 62.7 (52\u201373.5); observed species: 55.9 (45.24\u201366.71)] (Additional file 2: Table S2). Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 2b, the structure of the microbiota was affected by the Lee\u2019s status (see also Additional file 6: Fig. S3). Indeed, a significant clustering by Lee\u2019s status was observed (Adonis test p = 0.0199, R2 = 0.105). The present results may suggest that the richness of the CF respiratory microbiota is directly negatively impacted by first acquisition of P. aeruginosa; this very preliminary data has to be reinforced with a larger sample dataset.",
