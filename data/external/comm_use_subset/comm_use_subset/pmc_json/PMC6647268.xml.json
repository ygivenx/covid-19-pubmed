Clostridioides difficile toxin was identified by PCR testing of stool specimens (BD GeneOhm; Xpert); growth in clinical cultures identified cases involving Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (grouped together as gram-negative bacteria; GNB). Only the first encounter with one of the above-noted pathogens was included if a patient had multiple episodes of positive laboratory testing for that pathogen within 30 days. We excluded MRSA identified only from nares screening.

We constructed a longitudinal incidence rate using a monthly dataset which included respiratory viruses detected, antibiotic prescriptions filled, and meteorological parameters (total precipitation and average temperature), as well as detected bacterial pathogens (C. difficile, MRSA, GNB, and S. pneumoniae) (Fig. 1). A seasonal trend decomposition procedure, based on Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (STL), was conducted for each bacterial pathogen to assess for seasonality and trends associated with detection of respiratory viruses, antibiotic prescription, and meteorological parameters [13]. An additive decomposition model was used. To assess for a correlation between a time series and a given a number of lags, we measured the cross-correlation of Xt and Yt + k for each month. Separate cross-correlation functions were applied to determine the specific bacterial pathogens and their highest correlation with detection of respiratory viruses, antibiotic prescriptions filled, or meteorological parameters on defined time lags. We calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals, estimating risk of elevated incidence compared to annual average incidence. Due to the small numbers and multiple testing, the p-values should only be seen as descriptive measures. Analyses were performed using R (ver. 3.4.3; R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Packages used were: forecast, TSA (time series analysis) [14], and ASTA (applied statistical time series analysis) [15].",

The 7-month lag that we detected is longer than found in another study which detected a temporal relationship between fluoroquinolone prescriptions and ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA after a 1-month lag period [18]. A recent study revealed that antibiotics lacking MRSA activity, including fluoroquinolones, promote MRSA overgrowth in the nares and this may be related to finding increased MRSA detection in clinical isolates after exposure to such antibiotics [19]. Not surprisingly, a national antibiotic stewardship program has been associated with decreased MRSA prevalence [20]. We also found the circulation of respiratory viruses is likely associated with bacterial co-infection or superinfection due to S. pneumoniae (0-month lag with OR = 1.01) as previously reported [3].",

A study from Brazil found that average temperature on the day of diagnosis was associated with Klebsiella spp. (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.07\u20131.33) and A. baumannii (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07\u20131.34) [22]. However, this finding may not be replicated in different geographic locations with varying weather conditions [2]. The reasons for this association are unclear but likely, in part, reflects some advantage in environmental growth conditions with warmer temperatures among various GNB.

Misclassification bias may be present because we could not exclude clinically-insignificant microbial colonizers or bystanders which may have overestimated the number of true infections. We may have had selection bias since the microbiologic data was collected within our hospital system and outpatient facilities served by our microbiology laboratory and this data may not be reflective of all Rhode Islanders. Respiratory viral infections in children could have a different seasonal pattern compared to adults. There may be detection bias since healthcare providers may not have thought of ordering tests for respiratory virus detection outside of the winter season. In addition, there may have been a change in the denominator population captured over the time course that could potentially influence these findings. Since this is an ecological study, the temporal association can be easily confounded with other factors that are seasonal such as duration of antibiotics and the level of humidity. Viruses and bacteria in this study were detected in patients in one of our three acute care hospitals which comprises 55% of non-Veteran\u2019s Administration medical center acute care beds in Rhode Island, and at various outpatient settings in Rhode Island. Antibiotic prescription data was derived from a database that included people throughout Rhode Island, some of whom were not cared for in our healthcare system. Thus, we cannot associate antibiotic prescriptions filled and microbiologic test results on an individual level. Despite these potential limitations, we are not aware of other studies that assessed the relationships among bacterial pathogens, respiratory viruses, antibiotic exposure, and meteorological parameters in the same geographic region.",

The temporal association between antibiotic prescriptions filled with detection of C. difficile highlights the potential impact of robust antibiotic stewardship on reducing C. difficile risk. Prevention of respiratory viral infections may reduce risk of S. pneumoniae infections as previously described. A better understanding of the seasonality of GNB and MRSA may help to focus future infection prevention efforts. As such, continued research is needed to better understand why these infections follow seasonal patterns.",
