N. benthamiana plants inoculated with in vitro transcripts of TMV(24A+UPD) showed water-soaked lesions on the inoculated leaves and developed severe necrosis 5 days post inoculation (dpi) (Figs 3 and 4). The stem necrosis observed on TMV(24A+UPD)-inoculated plant leaves occurred earlier (4 dpi) than that on TMV-infected plants (6 dpi), resulting in a more rapid plant death than plants infected with TMV.

However, the longer poly(A) tract did not increase TMV infectivity. The viral RNAs accumulation of TMV(42A+UPD) and TMV(62A+UPD) were much lower than that of TMV(24A+UPD) in the transfected N. benthamiana protoplasts. Although the coat protein of TMV(42A+UPD) could be detected after 48 hours post transfection (hpt) in transfected protoplasts, its expression level was lower than that of TMV(24A+UPD).

It was also noticed that some adenine residues in the internal poly(A) tract were unreactive, which may be due to the fact that poly(A) tract can form a single helix structure with the ribose sugars in C3\u2032-endo conformation31 resulting in no SHAPE reactivity. It is also possible that these adenine residues might be involved in the interactions with the other parts of the structure, and thus affected the original structure and functions of the RNA.

It is particularly useful in predicting RNA secondary and tertiary interactions333435. We applied the SHAPE approach to gain insight into TMV 3\u2032-UTR conformation. This methodology employs an electrophilic reagent that reacts selectively with the 2\u2032-hydroxyl ribose group of single-stranded nucleotides to create a covalent 2\u2032-O-ribose adduct, while the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of structurally constrained residues shows reduced nucleophilic reactivity.

However, after increasing the introduced internal poly(A) length to 62 nt, there was no symptom observed on TMV(62A+UPD)-inoculated plants, and this mutant virus showed a rapidly diminishing accumulation of viral RNAs in transfected N. benthamiana protoplasts over time (Fig. 2).

Moreover, functional analyses revealed that CP accumulation of Coronavirus with a longer poly(A) tail was enhanced. This result is contrary to our result in that the mutant viruses with a longer internal poly(A) tract showed reduced replication in N. benthamiana protoplasts and less virulence in the whole plants (Figs 2 and 4). The difference between a poly(A) tail and an internal poly(A) tract lies in its relative position in the viral genome. In the mutants, both UPD+TLS are located downstream of the internal poly(A) tract. The TMV-TLS has been known to function as a 3\u2032-translational enhancer, which plays a similar role of stabilizing the viral RNA genome. The longer the poly(A) tail, the more stable is the virus. However, the internal poly(A) tract is located upstream of UPD+TLS, not at the 3\u2032 terminus of its genome. The structure formed by the internal poly(A) tract could affect normal functions of UPD+TLS, as our results have shown. When longer internal poly(A) tracts were introduced into TMV genome, accumulation level of the mutant viruses decreased (Fig. 2).",

TMV(62A+UPD) showed a reduced viral RNAs expression level and its CP was undetectable in the transfected N. benthamiana protoplasts. The absence of CP suggests that translation of viral proteins may be inhibited. Since there was no CP expression, encapsulation was not possible, resulting in degradation of TMV(62A+UPD) viral RNAs in the cytoplasm. The structural analysis of TMV(62A+UPD) showed that the conformation of the original TMV TLS was altered. As TLS is important for TMV replication by enhancing viral RNAs stability during translation, the altered TLS in TMV(62A+UPD) could be the reason contributing to the lack of CP expression. The larger hairpin loop of the 62 nt poly(A) tract may lead to the absence of CP expression and symptom expression. Most of the cis-acting RNA elements in RNA viruses are local sequences or confined secondary or tertiary structures40414243. The 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs of TMV interact with each other to form a closed loop that initiates virus translation. There is increasing evidence that long-range RNA base paring interactions also have essential functions, such as executing and modulating various viral processes44454647. Therefore, the large hairpin loop in TMV(62A+UPD) may pose steric hindrance to the region of interaction, or binding to several nucleotides complementary to the 5\u2032-terminal sequences, preventing the long-range RNA-RNA interaction.",

As the long range interaction of TMV 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs is mediated through host proteins, instead of direct RNA-RNA interaction42474849, using full-length RNA for SHAPE analysis would not reflect the long range interaction. The current SHAPE analysis applied has taken rational design that included a sufficiently long region of RNA (about 300 nt) which covers the RNA region of interest, internal poly(A) tract, UPD and TLS sequences. Also, the primer binding at the 3\u2032-end of TLS sequence would have less effects on the RNA conformations of UPD and internal poly(A) tract. At the 5\u2032-end of the RNA sequence, there was a short sequence consisting of 14 nucleotides (11nt + UGA) located upstream of the internal poly(A) tract for SHAPE analysis. It is likely that the structure of upstream regions may also be altered. Currently, the results obtained from using the partial sequence of TMV and the mutants have clearly demonstrated the structural differences in the 3\u2032-UTR. This is a widely accepted strategy used to analyze a local RNA region of interest50515253. In addition, mapping of long RNA using a whole viral genome54 is not common, as technically it is not trivial to achieve desirable results. Potentially it can lead to mapping of mis-folded structure if the RNA is folded without the appropriate interacting proteins involved. Also, there is a high possibility of having not only one but a mixture of RNA structures and it is difficult to detect and to avoid. It is more straight-forward to verify the folding of 300 nt RNA on native gels to establish appropriate conditions of folding leading to a single structure for analysis. Therefore, we choose RNA sequence covering partial CP ORF and the 3\u2032-UTR region of TMV and its mutants for the SHAPE analysis. Results showed that the length of introduced poly(A) tract could affect virus replication/accumulation and symptoms induced in N. benthamiana. Additionally, in order to monitor the variation of introduced poly(A) tract in TMV genome, we also verified the genomic sequence of TMV(24A+UPD) after its replication in N. benthamiana. The result showed that the internal poly(A) tract was also elongated as shown in HLSV. As our results showed that longer poly(A) tract upstream of UPD leads to reduced TMV replication, the elongation of internal poly(A) tract is likely to result from polymerase slippage during virus replication and it is an inherent property that exist in both HLSV and TMV mutants.",

It revealed that the longer the introduced poly(A) tract, the lower the virulence of the mutants. This appears to be associated with structural variations and dynamic changes. This research work represents the first application of SHAPE analysis to TMV 3\u2032-UTR and comparison of the length effect of introduced internal poly(A) tracts on viral accumulation. Our results provide a better understanding of the functions of UPD+TLS in relation to RNA structures in TMV. In addition, the new knowledge on the effects of different internal poly(A) tract lengths on virus accumulation has potential application in engineering TMV and its mutants into high-efficiency expression vectors.",
