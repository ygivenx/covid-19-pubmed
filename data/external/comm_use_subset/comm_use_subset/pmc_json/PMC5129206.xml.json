The index patient transmitted infection to close relatives, patients, and health care workers, and subsequently, some of these patients further infected others in a similar pattern. This was the largest outbreak of MERS outside of the Middle East. The large number of health care facilities involved in this event could be explained by the fact that many patients had visited multiple health care facilities before being isolated, and thus these exposures happened before MERS-CoV was suspected or diagnosed. The practice of seeking care at a number of medical facilities (\u201cdoctor shopping\u201d) may have been a contributing factor [1]. Meanwhile, the average number of doctor consultations per person has increased in many OECD countries since 2000. This was particularly the case in Korea, where in 2013 the number of such consultations was the highest (14.6) among the OECD countries compared with the OECD average of 6.5 per person per year [2].",

People usually do not have a primary care physician as a usual source of medical care (USC) such as general practitioners (GPs) in Western industrialized countries [3]. In many countries (e.g., Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom), GPs address a wide range of patient health problems. When necessary, they refer patients to other health care facilities for further examination or treatment and coordinate the various health care services with outside providers [4]. In Korea, however, people can freely visit medical institutions, see specialists directly on their own, and receive medical treatments by different providers for each episode of care.",

A USC in this study does not indicate a lay person who has primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of patients. According to previous studies, having a USC is important for quality of care and efficiency in health care and for health itself. Patients who report having a USC report greater trust and satisfaction with their providers [5], are more likely to receive preventive screenings and treatment for chronic health conditions, [6\u20139], and report fewer unmet service needs [7]. In addition, having a USC could reduce hospitalization costs [10], provide more effective and equitable care [11], increase vaccination coverage [12], enhance timely access to medical care [13], improve quality of care received, and result in improved health status [14]. More foundationally, having a usual physician was more important than having a usual place for receipt of certain preventive services such as blood pressure and cholesterol level checks for adults [14]. A combination of usual place and usual provider is a more coordinated approach to providing preventive care, leading to increased access and better health outcomes, whereas having a place for care but no usual provider, or not having a usual place, are both less advantageous [15]. Studies on having a USC have not been performed in countries with formal patient registration associated with capitation systems. Most of the studies were based on self-reported surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in the United States, and there is little knowledge regarding the current status and influence of having a USC in Korea.",

The positive impact of primary care on health comes from comparing the health of people who do or do not have a primary care physician as their USC [19]. This study disclosed fragile aspects of the Korean health care system by demonstrating that only 13.9% of adults in the 2012 KHP, a nationally representative sample, have a physician as a USC (21.5% have a place as a USC). A 2007 international survey by the Commonwealth Fund that consisted of interviews with representative samples of adults age 18 and older in seven countries found that the proportions of people who had a USC (one doctor and only one place) in other countries was 100% (100% and 0%) in the Netherlands, 97% (89% and 8%) in the United Kingdom, 96% (88% and 8%) in Australia, 95% (92% and 3%) in Germany, 95% (89% and 6%) in New Zealand, 91% (84% and 7%) in Canada, and 90% (80% and 10%) in the United States [20]. In addition, this study showed that only 34.5% answered positively regarding the coordination of care they experienced from their usual physicians among those who had a usual physician in the 2012 KHP. This finding is another extreme index of primary care in Korea that contrasts explicitly with data from other industrialized countries. In the above international survey, the proportions of those reported receiving coordinated care always or often were 70% in Australia, 69% in the United States, 67% in Canada and Germany, 60% in New Zealand, 58% in the United Kingdom, and 55% in the Netherlands [20].",

According to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in the United States, 63.0% individuals without a USC answered \u201cSeldom or never get sick\u201d as their main reason for not having a USC [25], which was similar to our results. However, the second-most common reason for not having a USC differed between the two countries: In Korea, it was \u201cthe preference to visit multiple medical institutions\u201d (27.9%), whereas in the United States, it was the cost of medical care (14%) [25].

Because hospital ambulatory care can be easily accessed in Korea, a usual hospital physician who can provide multi-morbid patients with coordinated care may be a pragmatic alternative USC from the patients\u2019 perspective. In reality, however, care coordination in Korea is very poor, and actual health outcomes according to the types of USC are rarely studied. Previous studies in Western countries found that adults who reported having a primary care physician rather than a specialist as a USC had lower subsequent five-year mortality rates after initial differences in health status, demographic characteristics, health insurance status, health perceptions, reported diagnoses, and smoking status were controlled for [26].
