The population of reproductive snow leopards is believed to be fewer than 4500 and is continuing to decline [5,6]. In 2008, the Snow Leopard Trust and Snow Leopard Conservation Fund initiated an ongoing, long-term ecological study of snow leopards in the South Gobi Province of Mongolia. During 2011 the field team recorded four snow leopard carcasses on separate locations, three within the study area in the Tost Mountains and one in the Gurvan Saikhan Mountain range, an adjacent range to the northeast. The causes of mortality were not established. There were no signs of trauma or starvation therefore other potential causes of death included infectious diseases. Two of the dead snow leopards were radio-collared territorial males with no overlap in their home ranges, suggesting independent causes of death. The finding of these dead snow leopards prompted the initiation of this disease study.",

However, pathogens with several species of reservoir hosts, as in the case of zoonotic pathogens, may be readily detected and can impact species at low abundance through disease spill-over [16].",

Due to the low numbers of snow leopards available for sampling, combined with the possibility of other species endemic to the area that could act as reservoir hosts for pathogens combined with the closeness of the nomadic herders to all components of their environment, we decided to target zoonotic pathogens that can circulate between different host species and hence also impact the health of snow leopards. The zoonotic pathogens selected to sample for were based on prior occurrence in Mongolia, pathogenicity, the potential to infect snow leopards and potential economic losses for the herders. These pathogens included Coxiella burnetii, Toxoplasma gondii and Leptospira spp. Two of the most severe zoonoses, anthrax and rabies, are known to occur within the study area but were not tested for as we were looking at prior exposure and not active infection. The potential of identifying positive results for those two pathogens would have been highly unlikely because of their extreme pathogenicity [22,23].",

Other wild species in the area include the grey wolf (Canis lupus), corsac fox (Vulpes corsac), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Pallas cat (Otocolobus manul), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), Eurasian wildcat (Felis silvestris) and several members of the mustelid family [24,25].

This technique was based on the amount of muscle over the shoulders and hips and whether the outline of ribs, scapular spine and iliac crest were visible and could be palpated. If scapular spine and iliac crest of hip bones were prominent, then the body condition was \u2018poor\u2018; if bony prominences were difficult to palpate the body condition was rated \u2018good\u2018. In between these two extremes, body condition was scored as \u2018moderate\u2019. Pelage was examined for thickness, signs of rubbing, alopecia and wounds. Eyes were examined for any sign of injury or defects. The oral cavity, including tongue and gingiva, were inspected for inflammation, ulcers or other lesions. Teeth were also examined as one of the indicators of age, or to see if broken or infected. Age estimation was based on body mass and tooth wear and tooth colouration [27]. The animals develop a darker cream tooth colour as they age. Scarring of the face in males was also used as an approximate indicator of age as younger males (<two-three years) have few or no scars [27]. Presumably older males obtain facial scars from territorial or resource fights. Females that had not apparently reproduced (< three years of age) typically had nipples that were lighter in colour and smaller than those of known reproductive females.",

Many of the captures took place at night at low ambient temperatures and as thermoregulation can be compromised by sedation, body temperature was closely monitored while the animal was sedated to ensure it did not drop below physiologically accepted levels [29].",

Potential sources of the three pathogens identified that is Coxiella burnetii, Toxoplasma gondii and Leptospira interrogans Australis, include snow leopard prey such as wild and domestic ungulates and overlap with scavengers, such as raptors and foxes at kill sites, allowing indirect interactions with other potential hosts and the pathogens they shed. Such potential indirect interactions could include sharing of common resources that are contaminated with pathogens such as water bodies and being parasitized by water-borne pathogens.",

Identification of these pathogens was based on antibody identification from prior exposure and not an active infection. For species where there is limited information, such as the snow leopard, there is a distinct need to continue long-term monitoring of their health to generate comprehensive baseline knowledge of what are normal parameters. Monitoring the survival and condition of animals over time can be achieved through radio-collaring, continual collection and testing of samples as per this study. Only through continued monitoring, including disease surveillance, can we start to understand the threats to this endangered species.",
