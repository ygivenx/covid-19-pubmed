            "text": "Fatty acids (FAs) are the primary components of animal fats and vegetable oils, which are important dietary sources of fuel and are required for energy storage, membrane proliferation, and the generation of signaling molecules [1]. FAs are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with carbon atoms ranging from 4 to 28, which are obtained by the hydrolysis of natural triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters. According to the number of their olefinic bond, they are classified into three categories, including saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with no olefinic bond, mono-unsaturated fatty acids (mono-UFAs) with one olefinic bond and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (poly-UFAs) with more than one olefinic bond [2]. In nature, UFAs generally have cis configurations, the opposed trans-UFAs (TUFAs) naturally present in ruminant adipose tissue and related dairy products. In food production, liquid cis-UFA (CUFA) esters such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated to produce SFAs or TUFAs, which are more stable and easier to store and use [3]. Thus, the SFAs and TUFAs are widely produced and used in the food industry such as for the production of margarine, snack foods, baked foods and frying fast foods in restaurants [4]. However, extensive experimental and observational data indicate that excessive use of SFAs and TUFAs can easily lead to cardiovascular and related diseases [5,6,7]. According to world health organization (WHO) estimates, the intake of TUFAs leads to more than 500,000 deaths of people from cardiovascular related diseases every year [8]. In order to protect human health, WHO enacted a plan named REPLACE in 14 May 2018, which is a stipulation to eliminate the industrially-produced TUFAs in the global food industry [8]. Therefore, the approaches to determine FAs profile in food industries are important in order to correct nutrition labeling and control of labeling authenticity, which is of great significance to the implementation of the plan of REPLACE.",

            "text": "The structures of FAs are diversity, because the length (carbon number) and unsaturation degree (olefinic bond number) of alkyl chains, position and configuration (cis/trans) of the olefinic bond in FAs are different. The chemical discrimination of FAs is difficult, because they lack special functional groups other than the hydrophobic alkyl chain and carboxyl group. Currently, the most used methods for the determination of FAs are based on gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) coupling with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis [9,10,11]. However, the GC/LC-MS techniques suffer from some drawbacks, such as being time-consuming, expensive, operationally complex and relying on sophisticated instrumentation that cannot be used for rapid and in situ analysis. Moreover, a variety of regio- and stereoisomers can exist for FAs, posing a challenge for MS based analyses. Chemosensors have been widely used in various fields because of their rapid, facile and convenient features, and these features just make up for the inadequacies of the GC/LC-MS related techniques. Until now, only a few colorimetric and fluorimetric chemosensors have been developed for selective sensing of FAs based on their overall shape [12,13]. The main capability of these chemosensors is discrimination of mono-CUFAs (with bent alkyl chain) from mono-TUFAs and SFAs (with linear alkyl chains), but they do not show promise in differentiating poly-UFAs and SFAs. Therefore, a portable sensing method for in situ inspection of FAs with different degree of unsaturation, position of olefins, and the configuration of the olefins is urgent but difficult.",

            "text": "It is well known that silver ion (Ag+) can complex with olefinic bonds reversibly [14]. The stabilities of Ag+-olefin complexes are highly dependent on the properties of olefins that can usually be divided into two groups, namely steric (chain length, cis/trans isomers and number of olefinic bonds) and electronic (conjugation and electron cloud density) properties [15]. Thus, Ag+ chromatography has been widely used for the separation of unsaturated compounds with subtle structural differences such as FAs and sterols [16,17,18,19]. However, a FAs sensor based on the selective complexation between Ag+ and olefinic bonds has never been explored. Interestingly, the colorless 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032,-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) can be oxidized by Ag+ and turn blue, and the color intensity is positively correlated with the concentration of Ag+ [20,21,22]. When combining the highly selective binding ability of Ag+ to olefinic bonds and Ag+ mediated color variation of TMB, a colorimetric sensing method to inspection of FAs is possibly designed.",

More importantly, they are easier to use in in situ inspections. According to the principle of paper-based colorimetric sensing, some specific reagents are necessary to develop color intensity and/or hue correlates with types and concentration of analytes [32]. Herein, considering the Ag+ mediated color variation of TMB and selective binding of Ag+ with olefinic bonds, we propose a test paper for FAs inspection (Scheme 1). By mixing Ag+ with FAs in a solution, a part of Ag+ could form Ag+-FAs complexes and the remnant part is free Ag+ ions. The free Ag+ could further oxidize TMB and develop blue colors. The proportion of free Ag+ is dependent on the concentration and type of FAs. Therefore, by taking advantage of the complexation difference of Ag+ to olefinic bonds of FAs, we successfully identified five types of model FAs with subtle structural differences. Using the approach described herein, the structural variation of FAs with heat treatment can be successfully monitored. Furthermore, the quality changes of mixture FAs in edible hot pot oils with heat treatment were successfully monitored by the test paper presented herein.",

The TMB alone exhibits no blue color and absorbance peaks (curve a and inset Figure 1a). When Ag+ was added to TMB, an obvious blue color with strong absorbance peaks centered at 652 nm was observed (curve b and inset Figure 1b), which could be attributed to the direct oxidation of TMB by Ag+, for there is no other reducing agent in this system. There was no blue color and absorbance peaks when oleic acid was added to TMB (curve c and inset Figure 1c), suggesting that the oleic acid alone has no effect on the oxidation of TMB. Significantly, when the mixture of oleic acid and Ag+ was added to TMB (curve d and inset Figure 1d), the blue color of oxidized TMB faded and its absorbance at 652 nm was decreased; because Ag+ complexes with the olefinic bonds of oleic acid, thus the content of free Ag+ is reduced and finally weakened the oxidation of TMB. According to a previous report [33], the strong complexation between Ag+ and FAs is attributed to the formation of \u03c3-bonds and \u03c0-bonds between olefinic bonds and Ag+. Therefore, the results of Figure 1 prove the feasibility of the Ag+-TMB sensing system in the inspection of FAs.",

The dark blue color of Ag+-TMB system is gradually weakened to light blue with the increasing of oleic acid concentration. Meanwhile, the corresponding absorbance of Ag+-TMB system at 652 nm is decreasing (Figure 3a) as the oleic acid concentration is increasing. Correspondingly, \u0394A with the increasing concentration of oleic acid were investigated (Figure 3b).

Figure 4b is the digital photo of Ag+-TMB sensing system towards the above five FAs, and Figure 4c is the corresponding absorption spectra. The number of 0 (blank) represents Ag+-TMB system with the addition of equal volume of ethanol without any FAs addition as the control experiment, and numbers 1\u20135 represent the above five FAs respectively. As shown in Figure 4b, five FAs displayed distinct colors ranging from dark blue to colorless, and the five types of FAs were readily distinguished from blank by the naked eye except for stearic acid (1). Because stearic acid has no olefinic bond, it cannot complex with Ag+ and produce color change. A similar result is observed in Figure 4c, that is, the addition of stearic acid has almost no effect on the change of absorption spectrum of Ag+-TMB system. For oleic acid (2), linoleic acid (3) and linolenic acid (4), they are all CUFAs but with different numbers of olefinic bonds: 1, 2 and 3 respectively. With the number of olefinic bonds increasing, the color changed from dark blue to colorless, and the corresponding absorbance of Ag+-TMB system at 652 nm gradually decreased. The reason for this is that the complexation ability of FAs with Ag+ increased with the number of olefinic bond increasing. Linolenic acid shows the lowest absorption at 652 nm and almost colorless, for it has 3 olefinic bonds and complexes with Ag+ more easily than other two FAs. As for different configurations of FAs, for example, in the case of oleic acid (2) and elaidic acid (5) which only have one olefinic bond at same position but with different configurations, the result of colorimetric sensing is distinct. Elaidic acid exhibits darker blue and higher absorption at 652 nm compared with oleic acid. Because the complexation between Ag+ and trans-olefinic bond is weaker than cis-configuration, therefore, the degree of TMB oxidation caused by trans- is more acute than cis-configuration. As a result, the color of Ag+-TMB system in the presence of oleic acid is lighter than the presence of elaidic acid.",

Edible oils are a very important source of FAs, and usually suffered from variations of unsaturation degree and configuration, which occurs when fresh edible oils are heated at high temperatures during various food preparations [35]. Illegal gutter oils are refined second-hand oils which is detrimental to people\u2019s health because their quality have been declined, but it is common to use these oils in the commercial food industry for maximized profits. Therefore, the inspection of the quality of edible oils is significant. As a very famous special food in China, hot pot is very popular there, and the oils used for this cuisine suffered continuous heating during the process of eating. There are many reported food safety incidents regarding second-hand oils being used in hot pot, therefore the quality monitoring of the hot pot oils is very important. Soybean oil is a commonly used edible oil in hot pot, which mainly composed of CFAs (ca. 81%), with saturated FAs as minor components (ca. 18%) [36]. In our work, we monitored the quality changes of soybean oil under continuous heating with different times. As shown in Figure 5c, the original oil (0 h) without heating is almost colorless, and with the increased heating time from 0 to 8 h, the color of the sensing system gradually turns dark blue. In the paper-based sensing results (Figure 5d), the original oil (0 h) shows the color of filter paper, and the color of paper gradually changed to dark blue with as the heating time increased. The color changes were mainly attributed to the variation of unsaturation degree and configuration of FAs, which lower the complexation ability of hot pot oil with Ag+, thus the adequate free Ag+ could oxidize TMB and develop blue colors. These results indicate that the portable and disposable test paper can be used to monitor the changes in oil quality by the naked eye, and the method can be used in in situ safety inspection of edible oils.",

For the first time, the approach we designed herein could discriminate FAs rely on the highly selective binding of Ag+ to olefinic bonds in FAs rather than the shape of alkyl chain (bent or linear). Based on the Ag+ mediated color variation of TMB, the test paper achieved colorimetric discrimination of five types of model FAs including stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and elaidic acid. Furthermore, the test paper was successfully applied to monitor the structural variations of oleic acid with heat treatment. Significantly, the quality changes of mixture edible hot pot oils with heat treatment was successfully monitored by the sensor. Thus, the facile, economic, portable and disposable test paper for FAs holds great potential in in situ food safety inspection.",
