EVD infection starts with symptoms such as fever, weakness, headache, myalgia, and pharyngitis (dry phase) after nine days latent period (range, 2 to 21 days), and then vomiting and diarrhea develop (wet phase). Internal and external hemorrhage can be found. The patient may recover, in 10\u201312 days from the disease onset [1-3]. EVD is usually transmitted through close contact within 1 m distance involving transfer of bodily fluid; in particular, substantial transmission occurs from dead patients [4,5].",

Moreover, it was noted that the risk of infection amongst medical staff who had a relatively higher frequency of close contact with patients was substantially high [7-12]. In the 2014 epidemic, USA, Spain, and UK, which have dispatched medical teams, also experienced casualties and cases of infection [8-10]. In the USA, it was reported that 2 cases of patients were returned home in the latent stage of EVD. One of them was not a healthcare worker (HCW), and in a related event, 2 additional cases of infection among medical staff have occurred domestically in the USA [13-15].",

For instance, \u03b2CH refers to the rate of spread in the case where infected persons from the community spread the virus to HCWs. The \u03bb was set by combining the different rates of infection from each group. Patients exposed to the virus become infected and can propagate the virus following a certain period. The constant \u03ba is the rate of progression in the symptom onset of EVD, and 1/\u03ba signifies the mean latent period of EVD. Patients with the onset of symptoms will be hospitalized after a certain period of time. The rate of hospitalization of infected patients is indicated by \u03b1, and 1/\u03b1 is the average duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization. Hospitalized patients become confirmed EVD cases through confirmatory diagnostic testing, and it is assumed that confirmed EVD patients will be isolated thereafter. The ratio of hospitalized patients to be isolated after confirmed diagnoses is defined as constant \u03b4, and 1/\u03b4 is the average duration of hospitalized patients to be isolated after their confirmed diagnoses. The constant \u03b3 indicates the recovery rate of the isolated patients, and 1/\u03b3 signifies the mean isolation period for recovery.

The rate of transmission of infection (\u03b2) is estimated by using the World Health Organization (WHO) report of new EVD case data for Sierra Leone at the time of the 2014 Western African EVD. EVD epidemic data were estimated by comparing data from the WHO\u2019s weekly accumulating patient number and that of the model from corresponding dates. It was also based on rates of transmission of infection that minimize the squared difference between the number of new cases from the data and from the model estimation, using the least square fitting method [6]. In parameter estimation, the direction of spread between the C and HCW groups was not considered. In other words, \u03b2HC=\u03b2CH. The details for estimating the rate of EVD spread using the Sierra Leone data are described in the Supplementary Material 2, and all rates of propagation, except for spread by dead bodies, are identical to the Western African model. The total number of susceptible patients (SC [0]+SH [0]) in the model is 51,709,000, within which the number of HCWs (SH [0]) is 558,970 [18,19]. The first imported patient is assumed to be one from the latent patients in the community (EC[0]=1). The basic reproductive number of EVD infections (R0) is calculated using the Next-generation method [20].",
