            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious enteric disease characterized by vomiting, acute watery diarrhea, and in particular, a high mortality rate in suckling piglets, resulting in substantial economic losses [1]. The etiologic agent of this disease is the PED virus (PEDV), which is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Alphacoronavirus. The disease was initially reported in England in 1971 [2] and Belgium in 1978 [3]. Since then, it has been identified in many swine-producing countries such as those in Europe and Asia, notably Belgium, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan [1, 4]. Between 2008 and 2010, new PEDV strains characterized by multiple insertions/deletions or mutations on the spike (S) protein compared with previous endemic strains have been reported in South Korea [5] and China [6, 7]. In April 2013, PED was identified in the US for the first time, and it rapidly spread across the country, causing the deaths of more than eight million newborn piglets during a one year-epidemic period [8, 9]. US-like PEDV strains have been reported in Germany [10], France [11], Belgium [12], South Korea [13], Taiwan [14], and Japan [15]. Currently, there are two PEDV types identified in the US: the original highly pathogenic (North American) PEDV [8] and the S INDEL PEDV, which has insertions and deletions in the N-terminal region of the S protein, with reportedly mild virulence in the field [9, 16]. Three novel PEDV strains with large deletions in the S gene have recently been identified in the US [17], South Korea [18], and Japan [19].",

            "text": "The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb long, and it comprises at least seven open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2\u20136) that encode four structural proteins, namely S, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N); two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b); and one accessory protein encoded by the ORF3 gene [1]. The S gene exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity [5, 20, 21], and the S protein plays important roles in interactions with cellular receptors during virus entry, the induction of neutralizing antibodies in natural hosts, growth adaptation in vitro, and attenuation of virulence in vivo [22]. Thus, the PEDV S glycoprotein is utilized for determining genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates and developing diagnostic assays and effective vaccines [23, 24]. Apart from the S gene, ORF3 is the only accessory gene in PEDV, and its product is believed to function as an ion channel and influence virus production and virulence [25, 26]. The ORF3 gene has been used to differentiate between field and vaccine-derived isolates. Vaccine-derived isolates with unique deletions of 49, 51, and 4 nt on the ORF3 gene have been confirmed [15, 21, 27]. Hence, these deletions can be used to differentiate between field and attenuated vaccine PEDV viruses.",

To determine the complete S gene sequence, five primer sets (CS1\u2014CS5, Table 1) were used to amplify five DNA fragments spanning the entire S gene. These primers were designed on the basis of the published sequences of reference PEDV strains [5, 9, 33]. EmeraldAmp MAX PCR Master Mix kit (Takara Bio, Japan) containing high fidelity DNA polymerases was used for performing the PCR amplifications under the following conditions: denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 54\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min; a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. When a partial S gene was amplified using the primer pair CS1-F/CS1-R from generated cDNA, one or two distinct bands of unexpected shorter sizes were observed in each PCR product in addition to the predicted band (Fig 1). The same result was observed when one-step RT-PCR tests (AccessQuick RT-PCR System kit, Promega Corp, WI, USA) were performed from extracted RNA and PCR tests using other kits containing high fidelity DNA polymerases (KOD FX, KOD FX neo, and Blend\u2013Tag Plus Kits, Toyobo Co., Japan) were performed from cDNA templates to amplify the CS1 fragment. The unexpected and expected DNA bands were also observed and distinguished upon performing PCR amplifications with longer fragments containing the first portion of the S gene (primer pairs CS1-F/CS2-R, CS1-F/CS3-R, and CS1-F/CS4-R). The PCR products containing the CS1 fragment were individually gel-extracted and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vectors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). The cloning reaction was then chemically transformed into One Shot TOP10 competent cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). Plasmid DNA was isolated using the FastGene Plasmid Mini Kit (Nippon Genetics, Japan). From each PEDV sample, at least 10 transformant colonies were selected for sequencing with a primer pair of the cloning vector (M13 Forward [\u221220] and M13 Reverse).",

In four farms (Te, Sa, Is, and At), the variants were not found in the primary outbreaks, but they appeared in subsequent pandemics. This indicated that PEDV variants could be transmitted from farm to farm and/or that the proportion of the variants in samples collected at the primary outbreaks was insufficient to permit detection of the variants by PCR. Additionally, PED outbreaks in Japan since late 2013 were proposed to be caused by the invasion of recent overseas strains [15, 31]. Taken together, it is possible that in the recent pandemic, both the PEDV variants and the strains with an intact S gene were introduced together from other countries, after which they spread across Japan. However, the earliest PED outbreak of the variants possessing the large S deletions occurred on Kagoshima on December 2013 (sample JKa-292) while the first PED case in Japan was reported earlier in Okinawa on October 2013. Presently, no PEDVs possessing the large deletions in the N-terminus of the S gene analogous to the Japanese variants was reported in other countries except PC177-P2 which was concluded to derive from cell adaptation in vitro. Therefore, the variants might have arisen spontaneously during the PEDV spreading in Japan. Further studies are required for the confirmation.",

In JAo-56, we could not identify any PEDV strain with an intact S gene. In the farm from which this sample was collected, the sows had never been vaccinated with modified live PEDV. Piglets in the farm manifested various severities of diarrhea from mild to severe, and the mortality rate reached 72.4% (670/926). The mortality rate was much higher than the mortality rate recorded in the epidemic during which Tottori2 was isolated (0%) [19]. Therefore, the large deletion in the variants observed in this study might not necessarily lower the virulence of this virus. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the virulence of variants in PED outbreaks.",

Among the few recurrent PED outbreaks reported in 2014 and 2015, all the samples collected from pig farms in Miyazaki (6 farms) and Aichi (2 farms) were found to contain the PEDV variants. In those farms, diarrhea in piglets was observed for a long time (up to three months), and outbreaks of PED were reported to frequently recur in intervals from three weeks to several months (S2 Table). Although many strict measures for establishing a high level of security were implemented such as quarantine of reposition, strict visitor policies, banning of unwashed vehicles, controlling of carcasses, movement of the caretakers on the farms and using virucidal disinfectants; PED still recurred in the farms. Therefore, it is suggested that mixed infection of PEDV variants with large genomic deletions may play an important role in the persistence of PEDV in pig farms.",

DI particles are defective for replication in the absence of the product of the deleted gene, and its replication requires the presence of the complete functional virus particle to co-infect a cell with it, in order to provide the lost factors [42]. The PEDV variants wherein large genomic deletions were observed may be DI particles. However, we speculated otherwise because the reported PEDV strains PC177-P2 and Tottori2 possessing the same deletions found in the variants of this study could replicate well in cell culture and cause cytopathic effect [17, 19]. Besides, the mutant strain PC177-P2 can propagate well and induce diarrhea in piglets [43]. A deletion of 215 aa (position 19\u2013233) in the N-terminal domain of the S protein analogous to the deletion observed in the variants revealed a not impaired propagation of PEDV in vivo [44]. Moreover, only variants with large S deletions were found in the field sample JAo-56, which indicated that the variants were able to independently propagate well in pigs. Additionally, all the deletions found in the variants are in-frame and the S proteins were predicted to express as a functional structure protein. Taken together, it is suggested that the variants with the large S deletions in this study were not DI particles.",

            "text": "Functions of the spike protein N-terminal domain of PEDV and other alphacoronaviruses were previously elucidated [44]. The loss of this domain occurred in a number of alphacoronaviruses correlates with a loss or reduction of enteric tropism. The most obvious example of this phenomenon is transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) that has a dual tropism targeting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of the pig. Meanwhile, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a natural variant of TGEV which lacks the S protein N-domain. It has reduced considerably its enteric tropism and primarily replicated in the respiratory tract then, produced an attenuated disease in comparison with parental TGEV strains. Another typical example is feline coronaviruses that have 2 pathotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causing a clinical mild or asymptomatic disease and feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) inducing a highly pathologic disease. FIPV is thought to be derived from FECV by natural mutation. However, compared to FECV, PIPV has a large deletion in the S protein N-domain which results in the loss of tropism for enterocytes [44, 45]. These examples revealed an important role of alphacoronavirus spike N-domain for viral replication in the enteric tract. The N-terminus (residues 1\u2013249) of the S protein was demonstrated to be responsible for the sialic acid binding activity of PEDV [44]. The loss of enteric tropism observed in TGEV was specifically associated with the loss of the sialic binding activity that located in the N-domain. However, how the sialic acid binding activity affects the tropism of these alphacoronaviruses remains unclear. The S protein N-domain of some PEDV strains were thought to be dispensable for replication of PEDV in vitro [44\u201346]. The large deletions in the S protein of the PEDV variants in this study indicated that this domain might also be dispensable in vivo. In the present study, the characteristics of large deletions found in the Japanese variants were highly similar to those observed in the PRCV that have a 224 or 227-aa deletion in the N-terminal domain of the S protein [47]. PRCV can persist in pig herds throughout the entire year, or it can disappear temporarily from a herd for several months and reappear subsequently. The emergence and widespread prevalence of PRCV lessened the clinical impact of TGE in the United States and Europe due to cross-protective immunity with TGEV [48]. Thus, the PEDV variants identified in this study might have biological characteristics analogous to PRCV and may persist in the pig farms of Japan. Unfortunately, we did not collect lung tissues from PEDV-infected pigs in these outbreaks, and virus isolation for the individual variants has not yet been completed. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the PEDV variants found in this study exhibited altered virulence, pathogenicity, and tissue tropism from the strains with an intact S gene. In future studies, we will continuously seek to answer this question.",
