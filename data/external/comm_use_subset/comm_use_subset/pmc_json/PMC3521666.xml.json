EBOV is the etiologic agent of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF), a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever with up to 90% mortality [1]. Since its discovery in 1976, EBOV has caused sporadic outbreaks in Sub-Saharan Africa with death tolls in the hundreds. Interestingly, while filoviruses have been only recently discovered, they are one of the few non-retrovirus RNA paleoviruses identified in mammalian genomes, suggesting an ancient relationship with mammals [2], [3]. Growing evidence suggests that bats are the natural reservoir of EBOV in the wild today [4]\u2013[6].",

            "text": "Current treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever is purely supportive, and the lack of effective interventions underscores the importance of developing a broadly-protective vaccine that confers long-lasting immunity. The ability to develop such a vaccine is critically dependent on our understanding of the mechanisms by which EBOV suppresses, distracts, or otherwise evades the host immune response [7]. One widely hypothesized immune evasion mechanism employed by Ebola virus is secretion of a truncated viral glycoprotein by EBOV infected cells. The EBOV surface glycoprotein (GP1,2) mediates host cell attachment and fusion, and is the primary structural component exposed on the virus surface. For this reason, GP1,2 is the focus of most EBOV vaccine research, and it is generally accepted that a robust anti-GP1,2 antibody response is crucial for protection against lethal EBOV challenge [8]. EBOV GP1,2 forms trimeric spikes on virion surfaces similarly to influenza HA and HIV Env [9]. Also like HA and Env, GP is first synthesized as an uncleaved precursor (GP0) which is then cleaved in the Golgi complex by the protease furin [10] into two functional subunits: The N-terminal GP1 subunit contains the putative receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the C-terminal GP2 subunit contains the fusion apparatus and transmembrane domain. GP1,2 is encoded in two disjointed reading frames in the virus genome. The two reading frames are joined together by slippage of the viral polymerase at an editing site (a tract of 7-A's) to insert an 8th A, generating an mRNA transcript that allows read-through translation of GP1,2\n[11], [12]. However, only about 20% of transcripts are edited, while the remaining 80% of unedited transcripts have a premature stop codon, resulting in synthesis of a truncated glycoprotein product (sGP) which is secreted in large quantities into the extracellular space.",

            "text": "Though its production is conserved in all EBOV species, there has been considerable debate regarding the function of sGP. Unlike GP1,2, sGP forms homodimers and appears to have some intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity [13]\u2013[17]. The recent finding that EBOV quickly mutates to synthesize primarily GP1,2 in cell culture, while this mutant virus reverts to a primarily sGP-producing phenotype in vivo, suggests an important role for sGP in virus survival within the host [18]. Because sGP shares over 90% of its sequence with the N-terminal region of GP1,2, it was initially hypothesized that sGP functions as a decoy for anti-GP1,2 antibodies. Early efforts to identify such activity yielded mixed results, and the observation that antibodies often do not cross-react between sGP and GP1,2 had cast doubt on this hypothesis [19]\u2013[23]. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that immunization against GP1,2 elicits antibodies largely against epitopes not shared with sGP [24]\u2013[27]. However, most of these studies investigated monoclonal antibodies from animals immunized with vaccines containing or expressing primarily GP1,2, which does not represent the state of natural infection. Of note, one early study examined monoclonal antibodies from mice immunized with a Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon that produces both GP1,2 and sGP, and found that many of these antibodies cross-reacted between GP1,2 and sGP [28]. Further, monoclonal antibodies isolated from human EHF survivors have been shown to preferentially react with sGP [19]. These studies suggest that sGP may play an important role in altering the host antibody response.",

We describe a mechanism that we term \u201cantigenic subversion\u201d, which is distinct from previously proposed \u201cdecoy\u201d mechanisms in which secreted glycoprotein simply passively absorbs anti-glycoprotein antibodies. Importantly, we demonstrate that sGP can also subvert an existing anti-GP1,2 immune response that was only weakly cross-reactive with sGP. Antigenic subversion represents a novel host immune evasion mechanism that has important implications for EBOV vaccine design, and may shed light on how the virus survives in its natural reservoir.",

            "text": "We first generated EBOV GP constructs to individually express GP1,2 and sGP. In natural infection, EBOV directs the synthesis of sGP and GP1,2 through differentially edited mRNA transcripts (Fig. 1A). However, it has been observed that DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (DDRP) do not edit with the same efficiency as the EBOV RNA polymerase [12]. Furthermore, in addition to polymerase slippage, it is possible that the 7-A editing site can also serve as a premature poly-adenylation signal, as well as a ribosomal slippage signal [29]\u2013[31]. We thus generated a panel of EBOV GP editing site mutants in order to control the levels of sGP and GP1,2 expression (Fig. 1B). GP-8A was made by inserting an 8th A into the wild type (GP-7A) editing site, resulting in GP1,2 as the dominant gene product. Silent A\u2192G mutations were introduced into the GP-8A editing site to ablate transcriptional slippage, resulting in GP1,2Edit, that expresses GP1,2 as the sole gene product. The same mutations were also introduced into GP-7A to generate sGPEdit, that expresses sGP as the sole gene product. These constructs were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pCAGGS) and protein expression was examined in both HeLa cells (Fig. 1C) and 293T cells (data not shown). Cells transfected with GP-8A and GP1,2Edit expressed GP1,2 intracellularly and on their surfaces, and secreted GP1,2 into the supernatant through previously characterized TACE-dependent cleavage [32]. Interestingly, GP1,2Edit produced higher amounts of GP1,2 than GP-8A. GP-7A and sGPEdit expressed high levels of sGP, which was secreted efficiently into the supernatant. GP1,2 expression by GP-7A was undetectable, likely because of minimal DDRP-mediated editing [12]. These expression experiments demonstrate that mutation of the editing site has a significant effect on GP expression.",

On the other hand, sGP-immunized mice developed much higher titers of sGP-binding antibodies than GP1,2-binding antibodies, despite the fact that sGP shares roughly 95% of its linear sequence with GP1,2.

As shown in Fig. 3A, antisera from GP1,2-immunized mice reacted strongly with GP1,2 but only weakly with sGP. On the other hand, antisera from sGP-immunized mice reacted strongly with sGP, but only weakly with GP1,2. This suggests that most linear epitopes targeted by anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice are unshared with sGP. To investigate whether the GP1,2-binding and sGP-binding antibodies in immunized mice were cross-reactive between the two GP isoforms or were separate populations of antibodies, we performed a competition ELISA to determine if sGP could compete with GP1,2 for GP1,2-binding antibodies (Fig. 3B). Similar to the Western blot data, sGP was unable to compete for binding of anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2 immunized mice (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from sGP-immunized mice. As expected, GP1,2 was able to compete with itself in all groups (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, we observed an identical reactivity pattern with native membrane-anchored EBOV GP1,2 using a cell surface competition ELISA (Supplemental Fig. S1). We further examined the ability of the two GP isoforms to compete with each other for antibodies by performing competition immunoprecipitation. Purified GP1,2 in the presence of sGP at varying molar ratios was immunoprecipitated with antiserum from GP1,2-immunized or sGP-immunized mice, and analyzed by Western blot using a polyclonal rabbit antibody that reacts with both GP isoforms. Antiserum from GP1,2-immunized mice precipitated both GP1,2 and sGP, and increasing concentrations of sGP did not attenuate the amount of GP1,2 signal (Fig. 3E), suggesting the presence of two separate populations of antibodies that do not cross-react between GP1,2 and sGP. However, while antiserum from sGP-immunized mice also precipitated both GP1,2 and sGP, increasing concentrations of sGP significantly attenuated the amount of GP1,2 precipitated (Fig. 3F), indicating that GP1,2-reactive antibodies in these mice are cross-reactive with sGP. As a control, addition of recombinant HA had no effect on the amount of GP1,2 precipitated by either antiserum group. Taken together, these data suggest that anti-GP1,2 antibodies induced by GP1,2 are directed primarily against epitopes not shared between GP1,2 and sGP, whereas such antibodies induced by sGP are directed against epitopes shared between GP1,2 and sGP.",

Pseudoviruses were generated using an Env-deficient HIV backbone pseudotyped with Zaire EBOV GP1,2. In order to achieve consistent neutralization, we pooled sera from the four highest responders among GP1,2-immunized animals and among sGP-immunized animals. Antisera from both groups were able to effectively neutralize pseudoviruses as measured by a luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 4A), although antisera from GP1,2-immunized mice exhibited more potent neutralizing activity than antisera from sGP-immunized mice, probably due to higher overall anti-GP1,2 titer. To determine if sGP interferes with neutralization, we used an antiserum dilution corresponding to 80% neutralizing activity in each group and preincubated antisera with different amounts of sGP. Consistent with the competition ELISA results, sGP was able to completely attenuate neutralizing activity of antisera from sGP-immunized mice, while it had no effect on neutralizing activity of antisera from GP1,2-immunized mice (Fig. 4B). Purified influenza HA was used as a control and had no effect on neutralizing activity of either antiserum group. Similar results were observed when we used an antiserum dilution corresponding to 50% neutralizing activity (Supplemental Fig. S2). These data confirm that sGP can compete with GP1,2 for anti-GP1,2 antibodies and interfere with antibody-mediated neutralization, but can only do so in animals that have been exposed to sGP.",

            "text": "The inability of sGP to compete with GP1,2 for antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice was intriguing considering that GP1,2 shares almost half of its ectodomain sequence with sGP. We reasoned that some of these antibodies may be directed solely against GP1,2 epitopes not shared with sGP, while other antibodies may be directed against shared epitopes, but preferentially bind GP1,2 because of conformational differences between the two GP isoforms resulting from tertiary and quarternary structure and steric shielding. To address this possibility, we used quantitiative ELISA to determine the relative titers and estimate the average affinity of antibodies from GP1,2 and sGP-immunized animals for GP1,2 and sGP. We individually examined purified polyclonal IgG from the five highest responders in GP1,2-immunized and sGP-immunized groups, and calculated the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of anti-GP1,2 and anti-sGP antibodies. This apparent Kd was calculated by Scatchard analysis as described elsewhere [33], [34] and represents an estimate of the average affinity of anti-GP antibodies, with lower apparent Kd correponding to higher average affinity. Consistent with above ELISA data (Fig. 2D), mice immunized against GP1,2 had higher titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies than anti-sGP antibodies (Fig. 5A). However, there was no measurable difference in the apparent Kd's of GP1,2-binding vs. sGP-binding antibodies (Fig. 5B), indicating that preferential binding of antibodies from these animals to GP1,2 is not due to affinity differences for different GP isoforms. In mice immunized against sGP we again observed very high titers of anti-sGP antibodies, and very low levels of anti-GP1,2 antibodies. However, those antibodies that did bind to GP1,2 appeared to have modestly lower Kd (higher average affinity) than did sGP-binding antibodies (Fig. 5B). Future studies with monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes shared between sGP and GP1,2 will provide further information on whether specific antibodies bind to the two GP isoforms with different affinities. Nonetheless, the present data provide evidence that differences in affinity are not responsible for antibodies from GP1,2 and sGP-immunized mice reacting preferentially with different GP isoforms.",

            "text": "The secretion of surface glycoproteins as a mechanism of absorbing antiviral antibodies has been hypothesized before for several viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (soluble G) and respiratory syncytial virus (secreted G) [35], [36]. It has been demonstrated that RSV secreted G can absorb anti-G antibodies and interfere with both neutralization and antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus clearance. However, we observed that EBOV sGP can only compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies in mice immunized against sGP. This led us to hypothesize that sGP may serve a role in altering the repertoire of epitopes against which the host immune response is directed, in order to divert the host immune response towards epitopes shared between sGP and GP1,2. To test this hypothesis, we vaccinated mice with a 3\u22361 ratio of sGPEdit\u2236GP1,2Edit (Fig. 6A) to simulate antigen expression during EBOV infection. Control groups were immunized with either sGPEdit or GP1,2Edit plus empty pCAGGS vector to keep the total amount of DNA constant. As a proxy for in vivo antigen expression, HeLa cells were transfected with corresponding ratios of sGPEdit, GP1,2Edit, and pCAGGS. As measured by Western blot analysis, the levels of sGP and GP1,2 expression in both lysate and culture supernatant of cells co-transfected with sGPEdit and GP1,2Edit were similar to cells transfected with sGPEdit or GP1,2Edit alone (Fig. S3). All immunization groups generated similar titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies (Fig. 6B). However, when we performed a competition ELISA using antisera from sGPEdit+ GP1,2Edit-immunized mice, sGP was able to compete with GP1,2 for over 50% of the anti-GP1,2 antibodies (Fig. 6C). Mice immunized with GP1,2Edit+vector or sGPEdit+vector displayed the same serum reactivity patterns we had observed previously in mice immunized against only one of the GP isoforms. Further, after boosting mice a second time, almost 70% of GP1,2-antibodies in week 12 antisera from sGPEdit+ GP1,2Edit-immunized mice were absorbed by sGP. Interestingly, in mice immunized with lower ratios of sGPEdit\u2236GP1,2Edit, significant sGP cross-reactivity was also observed, with almost 70% of anti-GP1,2 antibodies being susceptible to competition in mice immunized with a 1\u22361 ratio of sGP\u2236GP1,2, and about 25% being susceptible to competition in mice immunized with a 1\u22363 ratio of sGP\u2236GP1,2 (Figure S4). Similar results were also obtained with a competition immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 6D, antiserum from sGPEdit+GP1,2Edit-immunized mice was able to precipitate both GP1,2 and sGP, but increasing concentrations of sGP attenuated the amount of GP1,2 precipitated. Furthermore, while sGPEdit+GP1,2Edit antiserum was able to effectively neutralize pseudovirus infectivity (Fig. 6E), the addition of exogenous sGP almost completely inhibited pseudovirus neutralization (Fig. 6F), indicating that sGP can effectively interfere with antibody mediated neutralization in these mice. Similar observations were also made at an antiserum concentration corresponding to 50% neutralization (Fig. S5). Taken together, these data confirm that sGP can direct the host antibody response to focus on epitopes shared between GP1,2 and sGP, thereby allowing sGP to compete for antibodies and interfere with antibody-mediated virus neutralization. Furthermore, the observation that sGP can compete for a greater proportion of GP1,2 antibodies from week 12 antisera compared to week 6 suggests that iterative exposure to sGP gradually drives the host to a dominantly sGP-reactive response.",

Control groups were boosted with the same GP isoform. As shown in Fig. 7B, anti-GP1,2 antibodies were induced in all groups at week 12. However, in mice immunized with GP1,2Edit and then boosted with sGPEdit, sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies in competition ELISA (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, sGP was also able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from mice primed against sGPEdit and boosted with GP1,2Edit. We next investigated whether sGP is able interfere with virus neutralization by sera from cross primed and boosted mice. As shown in Fig. 7D, sGP was able to interfere with neutralization only from animals primed against sGP and boosted with GP1,2. On the other hand, antisera from animals primed against GP1,2 and boosted with sGP maintained their neutralizing activity in the presence of sGP. To further probe this observation, we compared the antisera titers corresponding to 50% neutralizing activity (NT50) in groups before (week 6) and after (week 12) boosting with the opposite GP isoform. As shown in Fig. 7E, neutralizing activity is not boosted by immunization with the opposite GP isoform. Thus, it appears not only that sGP can overwhelm the GP1,2-specific response, but also that it only boosts non-neutralizing antibodies induced by GP1,2. The observation that sGP can alter the reactivity profile of the anti-GP1,2 response has important implications for EBOV vaccinology, since during a infection, sGP could subvert the immune response of a previously vaccinated individual if the virus is not cleared rapidly.",

In this study, we analyzed antibody responses in mice immunized against sGP, GP1,2, or both GP isoforms and present evidence that sGP serves to redirect the immune response towards epitopes that are either not present or inaccessible in GP1,2, or epitopes that are shared between the two GP isoforms, thereby allowing sGP to effectively absorb anti-GP1,2 antibodies. We term this phenomenon \u201cantigenic subversion\u201d, because it is distinct from previously proposed mechanisms in which sGP passively absorbs anti-glycoprotein antibodies. In antigenic subversion, the ability of sGP to absorb anti-GP1,2 antibodies is critically dependent on exposure to sGP during induction of the anti-GP1,2 immune response. In mice immunized against GP1,2 in the presence of sGP, an immunization strategy designed to simulate antigen exposure during natural infection, we observed that most resulting anti-GP1,2 antibodies were cross reactive with and thus susceptible to competition by sGP, even though the titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies in these mice were similar to the titers in mice immunized against GP1,2 alone. On the other hand, in mice immunized against GP1,2 alone, we observed only low cross-reactivity of anti-GP1,2 antibodies with sGP, a finding consistent with previous studies, indicating that antibodies in these mice are largely directed against epitopes not shared with sGP [23], [24].",

However, because sGP is generated in much higher quantities than GP1,2, B-cells that recognize sGP epitopes and epitopes shared between sGP and GP1,2 are more likely to encounter their cognate antigens as compared with B-cells that recognize GP1,2-specific epitopes. Furthermore, as the sGP-reactive B-cell population expands, it will outcompete other B-cells for antigen and survival signals. Thus, the humoral response is skewed towards sGP, and epitopes of GP1,2 that are shared with sGP. Antigenic subversion represents a novel viral escape strategy that has some similarities to original antigenic sin (OAS). In classical OAS, initial exposure to a pathogen results in a population of memory B-cells that recognize antigens specific to that pathogen strain. Upon subsequent exposure to a different strain of the same pathogen, cross-reactive memory B-cells will respond preferentially, producing antibodies with high affinity to the initial pathogen which may not bind to the new strain as effectively [37], [38]. Furthermore, these memory B-cells can compete for antigen and survival signals with na\u00efve B-cells that might otherwise produce higher affinity or more protective antibodies to the new strain. Similarly, overexpression by Ebola virus of sGP ensures that sGP-reactive B-cells preferentially expand and outcompete GP1,2-specific B-cells for antigen and survival signals, resulting in a suboptimal host response that is directed away from membrane-bound GP1,2 on the virion surface. However, unlike classical OAS, this process does not require temporal separation of antigen encounters, but can also occur during simultaneous exposure to two partly identical antigens.",

In these animals, priming with sGP elicits antibodies against sGP epitopes, some of which are shared with GP1,2 (Fig. 8B). When these animals are boosted with GP1,2, memory B-cells that recognize shared epitopes vastly outnumber (and express higher affinity receptors than) the na\u00efve B-cells that recognize unshared epitopes. Thus, the anti-sGP memory B-cells will be preferentially activated and expanded, boosting the anti-sGP response. This situation is analogous to one in which previously-infected individuals are vaccinated against GP1,2, and raises the possibility that immunizing such individuals may simply boost an already unprotective antibody response. While filovirus infection is rare, our findings suggest that it may be necessary to devise alternate strategies for immunizing previously-infected individuals in a way that specifically boosts the anti-GP1,2 response and avoids subversion.",

We hypothesize that while the majority of B-cells activated in mice immunized against GP1,2 are directed against epitopes not shared with sGP (Fig. 8C), there is a small population of activated B-cells that react with sGP. This is supported by our observation that even though sGP cannot measurably compete in ELISA and immunoprecipitation for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice, these mice still develop low titers of sGP-binding antibodies. When GP1,2-immunized mice are boosted with sGP, these sGP-reactive B-cells expand while the remaining GP1,2-specific B-cells that recognize unshared epitopes do not, shifting the anti-GP1,2 antibody response from mostly GP1,2-specific to mostly sGP-cross reactive. Furthermore, it is notable that neutralizing activity actually decreased after boosting with sGP, despite an increase in overall anti-GP1,2 antibodies. Thus, boosting with sGP only augmented non-neutalizing anti-GP1,2 antibodies that are highly susceptible to sGP competition, while the existing neutralizing antibodies previously induced by GP1,2 in these mice maintained resistence to sGP interference. This situation is analogous to one in which an individual is immunized against GP1,2 is subsequently infected with EBOV. If the individual is unable to rapidly clear the virus, the virus may replicate sufficiently to subvert the host immune response. Thus, it will be critical for vaccines to induce high enough titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies to ensure that the virus is cleared before it is able to effect subversion (Fig. 8D).",

            "text": "The inability of sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice is consistent with a growing body of evidence pointing to the immunodominance of the GP1,2 mucin domain, a highly glycosylated region of GP1 not shared with sGP [24], [25]. This domain is thought to form a sterically bulky \u201ccloak\u201d that shields the putative receptor binding domain from host antibodies, as suggested for the HIV Env \u201cglycan shield\u201d [39]. The role that the mucin domain plays in host-pathogen interaction is complex and previous studies indicate that this region contains both neutralizing and infection-enhancing epitopes, and can mask epitopes on GP1,2 itself by steric occlusion [40], [41]. Furthermore, the mucin domain is the most divergent region of GP1,2 among EBOV strains, and is dispensible for GP1,2 mediated virus attachment and membrane fusion [42]\u2013[44], strongly suggesting a role in protecting more functionally conserved regions of GP1,2 from immune attack. Because the linear sequence of sGP corresponds to the putative mucin-shielded receptor binding domain (RBD) of GP1, it is possible that sGP works together with the mucin domain so that host antibodies are directed either to shared epitopes that are sterically shielded in the GP1,2 trimer, or to the mucin domain itself, which is cleaved off in the host cell acidified endosome along with any bound antibodies [45], [46]. The possibility that GP1,2 epitopes shared with sGP may be shielded in the GP1,2 trimer is supported by our observation that very few anti-sGP antibodies in sGP-immunized mice cross-react with GP1,2 despite the fact that sGP shares over 90% of its linear sequence with GP1,2. Furthermore, antigenic subversion allows sGP to efficiently absorb those antibodies that do recognize unshielded and shared epitopes in GP1,2.",

This is particularly important given that passive transfer of anti-EBOV monoclonal antibodies has gained traction recently as a post-exposure therapeutic. If sGP cross-reactivity turns out to be correlated with impaired virus clearance, it would underscore the need to elicit and produce GP1,2-specific antisera or monoclonal antibodies for achieving more effective treatment of EBOV infection. Moreover, our findings also suggest that EBOV vaccines should be tailored to target regions not shared between sGP and GP1,2. This is particularly relevant to recent efforts to develop a broadly-protective vaccine, since these studies have centered around focusing vaccines on conserved epitopes by deleting highly variable regions of GP1,2 such as the mucin domain [24], [43], [47]. Because sGP actually corresponds to the most highly conserved region of GP1, antibodies elicited by these constructs may be cross-reactive with sGP and therefore susceptible to sGP-mediated subversion. Candidate pan-filovirus vaccines may need to be focused on regions of GP1,2 that are both highly conserved and unshared with sGP, such as the membrane-proximal GP2 subunit.",

This possibility is consistent with nonhuman primate lethal challenge experiments, in which survival was most closely correlated with maintenance of anti-GP1,2 antibody titers above a threshold level, while lower antibody titers only delayed the time to death [48]. Further, while much of EBOV vaccinology has focused on eliciting protective antibodies against the membrane-bound glycoprotein, a robust T-cell response may also improve vaccine efficacy. Immunization of nonhuman primates with a low dose of GP and nucleoprotein (NP)-expressing recombinant adenoviruses was demonstrated to elicit robust antibody and T-cell responses and confer protection against lethal challenge [49]. More importantly, EBOV-specific T-cells were shown to reduce the threshold of anti-GP1,2 antibodies needed for protection. Recombinant vectors expressing CTL epitopes have been demonstrated to confer protection to lethal EBOV challenge in mice, and GP-specific as well as nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD8 T-cells can control infection even when adoptively transferred to otherwise na\u00efve animals [50], [51].

A vaccine directed against highly conserved regions of GP1,2, such as the GP2 subunit, could induce broadly reactive antibodies while also avoiding the potential for sGP-mediated immune subversion. Such a vaccine could protect against multiple strains of EBOV, including strains that have not yet been identified.",

B-cells are colored according to the regions of GP1,2 and sGP against which they react. (A) A na\u00efve animal begins with B-cells that can potentially recognize epitopes distributed throughout GP1,2 and sGP. When sGP is expressed at much higher levels than GP1,2, as occurs during infection, those B-cells that recognize sGP epitopes, many of which are shared with GP1,2 (red regions of sGP and GP1,2) are preferentially activated and expanded compared to B-cells that recognize unshared epitopes of GP1,2 (green regions of GP1,2). Thus, sGP-reactive antibodies dominate the immune response. (B) Prior immunization by sGP. Because sGP shares over 90% of its linear sequence with GP1,2, animals primed with sGP generate anti-sGP antibodies, many of which are directed against epitopes shared with GP1,2. When these animals (or individuals who have previously been infected and recovered from EBOV infection) are boosted with GP1,2, sGP cross-reactive memory cells outnumber and express higher affinity receptors than na\u00efve GP1,2 specific B-cells, resulting in preferential expansion of these sGP-cross-reactive B-cells and a predominantly sGP-reactive immune response. (C) Prior immunization by GP1,2. Priming na\u00efve animals with GP1,2 results in antibodies largely against GP1,2 epitopes not shared with sGP, presumably due to the immunodominance and high accessibility of the GP1,2 mucin domain and shielding of shared epitopes. When these animals are boosted with sGP, or if they are infected with EBOV and do not have sufficiently high titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies to clear the infection rapidly, memory B-cells that recognize shared epitopes encounter their cognate antigen and expand, while non-cross-reactive GP1,2-specific B-cells are not boosted, resulting in subversion of the host immune response towards sGP cross-reactivity. (D) Successful clearance of EBOV infection. In order to avoid sGP-mediated antigenic subversion, high enough titers of non-crossreactive anti-GP1,2 antibodies must be maintained to rapidly clear EBOV infection before subversion can occur.",
