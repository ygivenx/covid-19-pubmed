            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus continues to be enzootic in poultry in parts of Asia and Africa and transmits zoonotically to humans. From 2003 to November 2009, influenza H5N1 virus has caused 444 confirmed human cases and 262 of them were fatal. Human H5N1 cases were found in 15 countries; the three most affected countries being Vietnam, China and Indonesia, where the fatality rates ranged from 42\u201382% [1]. Although a swine origin influenza H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm) has recently emerged to become pandemic, its virulence for humans so far remains modest in comparison with that seen in zoonotic H5N1 disease [2]. As H5N1 virus continues to pose a threat to human health zoonotically and may still become more efficiently transmissible in humans through reassortment with the novel pandemic H1N1 virus or other means, it is important to understand the determinants of virus replication and its' pathogenesis in humans. Furthermore, elucidating the pathogenesis underlying the unusual virulence of H5N1 virus may help understand the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe viral pneumonia, including that seen occasionally in pandemic H1N1 [3].",

A comparison of H5N1 virus with seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) is likely to provide insights into the unusual severity of H5N1 disease in humans. Previously we used undifferentiated primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and alveolar epithelial cells to evaluate the virus replication kinetics and the innate immune responses induced by H5N1 virus compared with the seasonal H1N1 virus. Undifferentiated NHBE cells were readily infected with both seasonal H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses. But H5N1 influenza virus induced exceptionally high levels of cytokines and chemokines when compared to the contemporary human influenza H1N1 virus [5]. On the other hand, a recent publication by Zeng et al. [12] indicated that the highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 viruses elicits an attenuated type I interferon (IFN) response in the polarized bronchial epithelial cell line (Calu-3) when compared to a human influenza H3N2 virus. This apparent discrepancy in the reported literature prompted us to compare viral replication and host responses in undifferentiated (ud) and well differentiated (wd) NHBE cells in parallel. We hypothesized that the \u201cattenuation\u201d of host innate immune response by influenza H5N1 virus infection in wd-NHBE cells model may be due to the relative restriction of viral replication efficiency in wd-NHBE cells. We also aimed to compare the profile of the sialic acid (Sia) receptors that bind influenza viruses and the physiological properties of these two in vitro cell culture models with that seen in human bronchial tissue by using lectin histochemistry, a standard method for detection of the Sia linkages [13]. The influenza virus replication kinetics and the cytokine and chemokine responses in these cells infected with influenza A viruses, A/Hong Kong/54/98 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (H5N1) were compared. In summary, we demonstrated that the level of differentiation of NHBE has a profound effect on the expression of Sia receptors, virus replication competence and cytokine responses, including the type I interferon. Furthermore, H5N1 and H1N1 viruses behaved differently in the ud- and wd-NHBE cells. These results emphasized the importance of using a physiologically relevant respiratory epithelium model to study the pathogenesis of influenza virus.",

The higher expression of Sia-\u03b12-6 in wd-NHBE may account for the better replication of human influenza H1N1 virus which preferentially utilizes this receptor for entry. The lower abundance of Sia-\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc in wd-NHBE may be associated with the lower permissiveness of these cells for avian influenza H5N1 virus (which has a higher binding affinity to Sia-\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc).

Others have also reported that human influenza virus replicates more efficiently compared to avian influenza viruses in human differentiated tracheo-bronchial epithelial cells [24]. Our data are in agreement with these findings that the H5N1 virus replication in wd-NHBE cells was less efficient when compared to H1N1 virus. In contrast, as both Sia\u03b12-3 and Sia\u03b12-6 receptors were present in the ud-NHBE cells, with homogenous distribution in the majority of basal epithelial cells, both H1N1 and H5N1 viruses replicate well in these cells.",

Influenza virus inhaled to the conducting airway would first encounter this soluble form of Sia receptor in mucin before reaching the respiratory epithelial cell membrane with the Sia receptors that the virus needs to attach to in order to initiate infection. Secreted mucin with the Sia-\u03b12-3 receptor has been postulated to act as binding-decoy for influenza H5N1 virus, reducing the possibility of the virus to bind to the bronchial epithelium and achieve productive replication in the airway. Matrosovich et al have noted that even after extensive washing of wd-human airway epithelial cell cultures, there is still lectin binding to the cell surface-associated mucins [23].

There are however limited studies of cytokine responses in well differentiated bronchial epithelium. In our study of bronchial epithelial cells, influenza virus infection induced IFN-\u03b2, RANTES and IP-10 mRNA in these cells. Interestingly, a strikingly different cytokine and chemokine expression was observed in the ud-NHBE and wd-NHBE upon infection by the same virus. There were also differences between H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses in the profile of cytokine and chemokine release in ud-NHBE compared with wd-NHBE. At 6 h post infection of ud-NHBE, VN04/H5N1 virus led to a more potent expression of IFN-\u03b2, RANTES and IP-10 compared with HK98/H1N1 virus.

            "text": "Zeng et al. [12] previously reported that IFN-\u03b2 expression in Calu-3 cells at 24 h post infection with H5N1 was lower and more delayed than seen with seasonal influenza (H3N2). They found that this delayed IFN-\u03b2 response was associated with delayed induction of interferon regulatory factor-3 nuclear translocation and suggested that H5N1 evades the IFN-\u03b2 innate host defenses allowing it to replicate more efficiently. Our findings in NHBE cells are in agreement with theirs at 24 h post infection but we find this is associated with lower (not higher) levels of virus replication. Furthermore we find that at 6 h post infection, H5N1 virus induces more IFN-\u03b2 than H1N1 virus. These apparently contradictory findings may partly reflect the cell type (Calu-3 vs. NHBE) and the extent of cell differentiation in the two experimental models and the time of data collection. Calu-3 is a transformed continuous cell line originally isolated from a human pulmonary adenocarcinoma and they were differentiated in transwell culture inserts for one week only. In contrast, our wd-NHBE cells are primary cells derived from normal human bronchi, and are cultured and differentiated for 21 days in ALI. As shown in figure 1A, NHBE cell differentiation in our hands was not completed after seven days of ALI cultures when compared to day 21 (Figure 1B). Interestingly, studies on the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using polarized Calu-3 cells and differentiated human airway epithelial cells [29], [30] found that the latter supported a more productive replication of SARs-CoV. Since SARS-CoV infects ciliated cells, this difference was attributed to the lower numbers of ciliated epithelial cells obtained in the polarized Calu-3 cell model [31]. It is possible that the wd-NHBE cell model which recapitulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting airway in vivo would be a more representative model to study respiratory infection.",

This reinforces the importance of the use of physiologically relevant models for the understanding of influenza pathogenesis. It is relevant to note that a regenerating epithelium recovering from mucosal damage caused by viral or other agents would have the equivalent of undifferentiated epithelial cells present, thus the data from ud-NHBE may still be physiologically relevant to such a situation.",
