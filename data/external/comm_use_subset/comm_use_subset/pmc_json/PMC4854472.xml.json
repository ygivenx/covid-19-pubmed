However, influenza cases are reported almost year-round in tropical regions. Taiwan is located in the tropical-subtropical region of the Northern Hemisphere, split north-south near the middle of the island by the Tropic of Cancer. Influenza cases are reported throughout the year with some summer influenza epidemics, but with peak number of reported cases occurring annually in autumn and winter from late October to March [2]. Moreover, studies have shown that excess influenza deaths during these months similar to those in the temperate zones can also observed in Taiwan [3\u20134]. It has also been proposed previously that Taiwan is an evolutionarily leading region for global circulation of influenza virus A (H3N2) [5]. Moreover, past studies on sequence comparison of seasonal influenza strains A(H1N1) in Taiwan versus vaccine strains have showed that many vaccine-like Taiwanese strains in 1995\u20132003 were circulating at least 2 years before the vaccine strains were introduced [6]. Hence investigating circulation patterns of seasonal influenza virus strains might shed lights on possible global circulation patterns in the following years.",

Influenza viruses (of the family Orthomyxoviridae) are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses with segmented genomes [7]. Of its two genera, one includes influenza A and B viruses, and the other influenza C virus. Type A influenza viruses are subtyped based on 16 known hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) subtypes that exist in wild birds and provide a source of viral HA and NA subtypes antigenically novel to humans. The subtypes are further classified according to the combinations of virus surface proteins, abbreviated as H1\u2013H16 and N1\u2013N9 [8\u20139], starting with the 1918 swine H1N1 influenza which led to the 1918\u20131920 influenza pandemic. Its descendants include an H2N2 pandemic strain in 1957, which circulated until 1968 when it was replaced by H3N2 pandemic viruses. Among many subtypes of influenza A viruses (IAV), influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes are currently circulating yearly among humans. Type C influenza cases occur much less frequently than that of A and B. Therefore, only influenza A and B viruses are included in seasonal influenza vaccines recommended every year by the WHO.",

Examining past influenza pandemics throughout history, it has been observed that strains of pandemic influenza also led to succeeding seasonal waves, albeit with decidedly different patterns. For example, while the 1889\u20131893 pandemic made three or more successive annual and largely seasonal reappearances, the 1918 pandemic spread in two or three rapidly recurring waves within a short period of time in many parts of the world (e.g., [11]) before settling into a pattern of annual seasonal recurrences [12]. Yet both of these pandemics resulted in high human mortality, especially that of 1918. On the other hand, the virus strains causing the 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) influenza pandemics, unlike their 1918 H1N1 virus predecessor, did not immediately produce rapidly successive waves of infections or multiple annual recurrences of high mortality, but settled more quickly into familiar patterns of annual seasonal endemic circulation [13\u201314].",

The aim is to use mathematical modeling to pinpoint the temporal circulation and/or co-circulation of different strains in order to gauge the difference in their transmissibility, if any, and how they interact or compete for the human host population, with hope to provide some insights on how the 2009 pandemic impacts the circulation of seasonal influenza in the years following the pandemic.",

Nasal and/or throat swabs were collected from patients with influenza-like-illness (ILI) through 255 contracted healthcare facilities and laboratories in all parts of Taiwan (Table 1). Unavoidably, the number of samples taken varies greatly in time due to temporal changes in disease surveillance, in particular during a pandemic. For example, substantially larger number of samples was taken in the fall influenza season in 2009, and subsequently during similar seasons in 2010 and 2011, in an effort to ascertain the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 infections in Taiwan inn post-pandemic years. These samples were tested for virus subtype with RT-PCR or virus isolation, and with HA or NA genes of the isolated virus sequenced. The samples were determined to be one of the five influenza virus strain: B, AH1, A(H1N1)pdm09, AH3, and H3N2, with A(H1N1)pdm09 isolated only after week 26 of 2009 and H3N2 only after week 33 of 2011.",

This co-circulation of variants distinguished by specific AA substitutions was witnessed among H3N2 strains observed in Ontario, which are found to be related to the Victoria clade by using phylogenetic analysis. Due to the emergence of the Victoria 208 clade of A/Perth/16/2009 strain, WHO recommended a change to the H3N2 strain component of the 2012\u20132013 influenza vaccine, to A/Victoria/361/2011-like virus [41]. This highlights the hypothesis that antigenic drift among one subtype could still lead to epidemic event in human history. In this study, we present quantitative evidence of different values of R for different epidemic waves of the same influenza subtype (Fig 3). Recent studies have shown that antigenic drift might help to explain seasonal influenza circulation patterns in particular subtypes [42].",

The data used came from TCDC influenza surveillance system data, where the samples were collected from patients with ILI from 255 contracted healthcare facilities and laboratories in Taiwan, which is not a random sampling of influenza cases in Taiwan. Unfortunately, the proportion of ILI cases tested is not known, and the proportion of positive tests varies from year to year (see Table 1). Moreover, the subtype-specific proportion of positive tests is not available from Taiwan CDC database. Hence we are unable to suitably adjust for the differences in the sampling rate, which results in unavoidable bias. This common but severe limitation in virology data size leads to uncertainty in our result. Since the proportion of asymptomatic cases might also be affected by specific subtype, this issue can only be satisfactorily resolved with comprehensive serotesting on the population level, which is not feasible given the limitation in laboratory testing today.",

However, we note that most of the samples tested during that time was determined to be H3N2 (Fig 4b), although the typically low weekly number of samples being tested during summer, due to more mild and subclinical cases in summers, became an obstacle for good model fitting. Nevertheless, the study, designed to qualitatively compare the temporal patterns and transmissibility of the waves of different strains, illustrates how influenza subtyping data can be utilized to explore the mechanism for various influenza strains to compete or to circulate, despite obvious data limitations.",

Fitting cumulative data also has the potential drawback of introducing auto-correlation, potentially leading to biased high estimates of R [43]. Moreover, model fitting of cumulative disease data could also lead to errors in parameter estimates and subsequently in the corresponding CIs [44]. However, our interpretation of transmissibility deals mainly with the quantitative analysis on comparative variations in R for different strains and genotype variants using the same modeling framework, and hence is still valid.",

More importantly, it demonstrate the possibility that, with potential future advances in laboratory subtyping techniques that would enable us to be more easily accessible to more comprehensive information on the circulating influenza strains in a population, one can more readily ascertain the relationship, if any, between the evolution of influenza strains quantitatively such as we do in this study.",
