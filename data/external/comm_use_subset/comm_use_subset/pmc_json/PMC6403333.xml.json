            "text": "Parasitic diseases not only cause millions of deaths per year, but also have serious health and economic consequences1. Among all the parasitic diseases, protozoan parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae are responsible for devastating diseases in humans, dogs as well as livestock, resulting in severe illness or even death if left untreated1,2. The protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and Leishmania spp. are the causative agents of Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis respectively3. Even though these diseases are endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, in the last decades there has been a re-emergence also in developed countries, with international travel being responsible for increases in reported cases of Trypanosomatidae infections in non-endemic countries1,4. Consequently, these parasitic infections have become a more important public health issue of global relevance. Even though there are several methods available for the screening of parasitic infections, however, they have not yet changed dramatically the diagnosis in developing countries. Microscopic identification and parasite cultivation are still the primary diagnostic tools employed in many regions where Leishmaniasis is endemic5. These methods, unfortunately, require extended incubation times and are expensive, requiring specialized equipment and highly trained personnel6. On the other hand, standard serological approaches that could potentially prove to be timely and cost effective for diagnosing parasitic infections are of limited value, as most patients do not develop a significant antibody response7. In addition, and problematically for clinicians attempting to make an accurate diagnosis, T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. share various antigens that cause cross-reactivity in serological diagnosis when complex antigenic mixtures are used8. As a result, Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) methodologies have become valuable methods for the routine and accurate assessment of parasitic infectious diseases. NAT benefits from the presence of specific nucleic acid fragments for determining the presence/absence of pathogens3,9\u201313. There are different methods ranging from probe hybridization, amplification of genomic targets and sequencing of nucleic acid fragments. The use of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NAATs) such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), real-time PCR or Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) can be very useful in detecting infections and post-treatment monitoring9,13,14, including detection and distinguishing of parasites using single base resolution methods such as Single Base Extension (SBE). Primers are designed to hybridize to a complementary nucleic acid region such that the 3\u2032 end of the primer finishes immediately before the nucleotide under interrogation15. However, while NAT has the advantage of being sensitive, there are some limitations, as the NAT methodologies have complex protocols, require technical expertise to run and interpret data (not cost-effective), and utilize equipment that is incompatible with use in remote and low-resource locations, such as developing countries where diagnostic laboratories are often poorly resourced and sparsely distributed16. Thus, there is an urgent need for early detection of infectious disease with improved, simple and low-cost alternative tests not requiring expensive laboratory equipment to be performed. To sum up, while laboratory-based models require benchtop laboratory facilities and complex procedures, Point-of-Care testing allows a more decentralized diagnostic analysis with additional advantages such as portability, automation, shorter time-to-results and lower cost17\u201319. The World Health Organization (WHO) is consistently encouraging developers to implement these new diagnostic technologies for improved effective clinical management and treatment of the major infections suitable in developing countries context20,21. These diagnostic devices should follow WHO criteria, the ASSURED acronym (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free and deliverable)22,23. Following this encouragement, Zhang et al. recently developed a low-cost CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx) for detecting DNA or RNA molecules of pathogenic species with single mismatch specificity24,25.",

SNF markers are single nucleotide variations that occur at specific positions in conserved target nucleic acid sequences, allowing the differentiation of pathogenic species. As a result, these SNF represents the perfect target to be interrogated by the ChemNAT technology through the specific dynamic incorporation of aldehyde-modified SMART-Nucleobases into the abasic position of abasic PNA probes.

This novel method combines ChemNAT technology with a simple colorimetric end-point assay on a porous nylon membrane contained within a micro Spin-Tube device (Spin-Tube). The assay uses a singleplex PCR to amplify a highly conserved sequence of DNA, which encodes the RNA component of the large ribosome subunit with SNF markers for the two different parasite species under interrogation. This amplicon is later interrogated by the ChemNAT technology that relies on a dynamic chemical approach for nucleic acid testing. As shown in Fig. 1, the SNF sequence analysis is based on combining biotinylated aldehyde-modified cytosine (SMART-C-Biotin) with unique abasic PNA probes to target PCR amplicon strands, such that a nucleobase-free position on the PNA strand (known as \u2018abasic\u2019 position) lies opposite to two different nucleotides under interrogation on the DNA amplicons. A reversible reaction between the SMART-C-Biotin and a free secondary amine on the abasic PNA probes generates an iminium intermediate, which can be chemically reduced to a stable tertiary amine. Within the novel Spin-Tube, the dynamic chemistry reaction mixture is added to the nylon membranes on which the abasic PNA probes have been immobilized following a specific spot pattern (Fig. 1, Step 1). The PCR amplicons act as template molecules and drive the specific incorporation of SMART-C-Biotin molecules into a specific abasic PNA according to Watson-Crick DNA base pairing model in which the SMART-Cytosine, in this case carrying a biotin tag, is ONLY recognized by a guanidine nucleotide (Fig. 1, Step 2). The labelling is then achieved by streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (Streptavidin-ALP) to produce colorimetric signal (blue precipitate) patterns when the chromogenic substrate (NBT/BCIP, nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) is added. Each parasite gives a unique colored spot pattern that can be read by naked-eye (Fig. 1, step 3).",

            "text": "PCR amplification was carried out to amplify the conserved region encoding for the 28S ribosomal RNA delta genes. As shown from the multiple sequence alignment in Fig. 2A, the PCR amplification of the target sequence was performed using a single pair of primers (singleplex PCR) which amplifies any of the parasite species present in the sample. The target region is highly conserved among the Trypanosomatids\nT. cruzi and L. major, except for five SNFs. Amplified fragment analysis was performed using the previously described Spin-Tube. Briefly, abasic PNA probes, PNA1 and PNA2 were designed in order to hybridize efficiently with the amplified single strand sense DNA, with the important particularity that the abasic positions in the PNA probes are opposing the nucleobases under interrogation. Once the abasic PNA probes hybridize with target sequences, the SMART-C-Biotin dynamic incorporation takes place, enabling the unequivocal identification of the parasite present in the amplicon sample, because of the unique colorimetric pattern that each Trypanosomatid amplicon generates. As shown in Fig. 2B, the abasic PNA1 probe was designed so that its abasic site lies opposite a guanidine nucleotide (at position + 32 of the amplicon), irrespective of the species, so as to give a positive result for both parasites, thus confirming the presence of one or both Trypanosomatids in the sample (see red arrow in Fig. 2A). At the same time, the abasic PNA2 is the probe that enables discrimination of the Trypanosomatid species. As the target parasite T. cruzi has a guanidine at the position that lines up with the \u201cabasic\u201d position in the abasic PNA2 probe (SNF1 in Fig. 2B), the SMART-C-Biotin incorporation is templated, thereby covalently incorporating the biotin tag into the probe attached to the membrane, resulting in a blue spot after applying the labelling and color development protocol. DNA coming from L. major has the same sequence but with an adenosine at the SNF1 position (instead of a guanine, see Fig. 2B). This DNA hybridizes with PNA2 but SMART-C-Biotin is not incorporated and so no signal is detected on abasic PNA2. In summary, this approach requires two specific molecular events to create a signal: (i) perfect hybridization between nucleic acid strands and complementary abasic PNA probes; and, (ii) specific molecular recognition, through guanidine-cytosine base-pairing to allow SMART-C-Biotin incorporation onto the abasic site of the PNA probes (Fig. 2C).",

As shown in Fig. 3B, the Spin-Tube consists of: (i) a centrifuge collection tube; (ii) an internal column for the assay; (iii) a nylon membrane (pre-spotted with abasic PNA probes) immobilized onto the bottom of the column via a plastic pressure ring (iv). The abasic probes were amino-PEGylated at their N-terminal end and printed onto nylon membranes containing pre-activated carboxyl groups (Fig. 3C). An important stage in the construction of the Spin-Tube, apart from the immobilization of abasic PNAs, was the definition of the array probe layout (Fig. 3D). Probes with fixed concentrations were printed with an automatic nano-plotter onto the nylon membrane, and optimization of signal strength and best signal to background ratios was undertaken. Taking into account the 8 mm membrane diameter, it was decided to create a 2 \u00d7 3 array. Abasic PNA1 and PNA2 were printed onto two parallel rows of three spots each (6 features in total, in red and blue in Fig. 3D respectively). Two control biotin-labelled DNA oligomers were printed on the top row of the array, to identify array orientation and provide a labelling internal control (in yellow in Fig. 3D). Following printing, performance of probes was initially checked by using synthetic mimic DNA oligomers and SMART-C-Biotin incorporation (data not shown).",

As previously described by our group, abasic neutral PNA probes immobilized onto solid surfaces have been found to lack stability and can exhibit a degree of undesirable deformation, flexing and/or bending36. This affects the performance (e.g., specificity and/or sensitivity) of the abasic PNA probes in this assay \u2013 preventing maximum target binding and assay performance. Abasic PNA1 and PNA2 were designed and synthesized with these solid surface challenges in mind, adding PNA monomers containing propanoic acid residues at their gamma positions across the probe backbone, improving the probe performance and reducing self-aggregation (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2 in SI). Moreover, these gamma modifications give rise to a sterocenter, hence creating chiral PNAs molecules, being just the L-PNA monomers the ones producing PNA oligomers capable of hybridizing complementary natural nucleic acids37\u201340. The result was that the L-propanoic abasic PNA probes bound to nylon membrane were more readily available to hybridize to complementary nucleic acid strands. Still unknown was if such abasic PNA probes would prove to be less prone to flexing, bending or otherwise deforming from their \u201cnormal\u201d linear configuration36. The modifications introduced led to the two probes demonstrating improved specificity and improved sensitivity towards a base complementary to the nucleobase of the DNA amplicon to be characterized. The abasic position monomer was also modified with this propanoic acid chain at gamma position and with the same stereochemistry allowing a better dynamic incorporation of the SMART-C-Biotin because of the spatial orientation of the free secondary amine of the \u201cblank\u201d position (Fig. S2 in SI).",

Singleplex PCR was carried out to amplify the highly conserved segment of DNA containing the two single nucleotides under interrogation (Fig. 2). DNA amplicon products were denatured and then together with the dynamic chemistry reaction reagents added directly into the internal column of the Spin-Tube that supports the nylon membrane for the color-development assay (Fig. 4). Subsequently, the reaction was carried out at a constant temperature of 45 \u00b0C avoiding the need to make use of sophisticated apparatus. Single stranded DNA hybridizes with the abasic PNAs acting as template molecules, driving the error free incorporation of SMART-C-Biotin into the specific chemical pocket. Finally, the incorporated SMART-C-Biotin is labelled with a streptavidin-ALP, so that a colorimetric signal pattern was generated when the chromogenic substrate is added. The signal pattern generated by the protocol allows the visual or photographic imaging of which species cause the patient infection. L. major gDNA generated a signal ONLY at the abasic PNA1 probe, as its abasic site lies opposite a guanidine at +32 position from the 5\u2032-terminus of amplicon (see red arrow in Fig. 2). While, T. cruzi gDNA generated signals for both abasic PNA probes. The abasic sites of both PNA probes lie opposite a guanidine, allowing the incorporation of SMART-C-Biotin with its biotin tag, thus resulting in a blue spot after its incorporation. Results in Fig. 4 show a successful identification of parasites present in samples, and in line with the expected results, showing (a) L. major positive for abasic PNA1 ONLY and (b) T. cruzi positive for both abasic PNA probes.",

This tool was also used to study which other Leishmania species were suitable to be submitted to this singleplex PCR. Forward and reverse primers were blasted towards other organisms using NCBI primer BLAST tool. It was found that mainly genome from Trypanosomatids species matched the designed primers. Although, a few other genome sequences could also be amplified by our designed primers (Schistosoma mansoni, Leptomonas pyrrhocoris, Aspergillus sclerotioniger and Aspergillus eucalypticola), all these infectious agents cause diseases with clinical manifestations very different from those manifested in Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease and therefore other diagnostic paths would be proposed. Another key factor of the assay Spin-Tube is the signal emerges after the dynamic incorporation of SMART-C-Biotin into the abasic site of the abasic PNA probes. Even if off-target sequences are amplified, no colored spots will be observed. So, DNA strands coming from any off-target species will not create a signal, as that DNA strends will not have precise homology with both forward and reverse primers, as well as the region complementary to the abasic PNA within a narrow area of its genome.",

Important to note in this study, 3 biotin markers were printed on the top row of the array, rather than 2 (Fig. 6A). Instead of simple circular plastic-ring (see red arrow in Fig. S1-D in SI), here for the construction of Spin-Tube, pressure plastic-ring with three plastic teeth (see white arrow in Fig. S1-D in SI) were used. Six different amounts of gDNA (50 ng, 5 ng, 0.5 ng, 0.05 ng, 0.005 ng, 0.0005 ng) were studied (Table S1 in SI). PCR amplifications were validated and quantified by capillary electrophoresis. All but the two lowest amounts of gDNA (0.005 ng and 0.0005 ng) produced amplicons which were able to be detected and quantified by capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 6B). The amplification products were then used as template for the dynamic incorporation of SMART-C-Biotin within the Spin-Tube. Positive signals were obtained for both abasic PNAs as anticipated, confirming the presence of T. cruzi (Fig. 6C).",

Almost no difference was observed by eye for the membranes in which 50 and 5 ng of T. cruzi gDNA was used as template for the PCR, whereas the relative signal intensity quantification by ImageJ software showed a slight lowering of signal as the genomic amounts decreased (Fig. 6C). The lowest point which could be detected was 0.05 ng or 8.7 copies/\u00b5L of template (see SI, Table S1 for the correlation of ng of gDNA and copy number). No results were observed for the two lowest genomic quantities, respectively 0.05 and 0.005 ng. These results confirm what had been already observed using capillary electrophoresis, further confirming that the limit of detection of the dynamic incorporation assay depends on the PCR yield to provide sufficient template. Reactions in which not enough copies of amplicons were created were mis-called as parasite free, being false negatives. Negative control (made with H2O as template for the PCR) was also called as parasite free, being a true negative result.",

            "text": "Our previous SNF sequence analysis by mass-based assay (MALDI-ToF) for trypanosomiasis identification has been further developed onto a new ultra-low-cost, easy and fast to use (~3 hours/test) Spin-Tube device. This novel device was designed to combine the dynamic chemical approach for nucleic acid reading (ChemNAT technology) with a colorimetric method in a plastic column and nylon membrane device (Spin-Tube). The Spin-Tube accurately distinguish and identify Chagas disease vs. Leishmaniasis. The test consists of a singleplex PCR to amplify a highly conserved sequence of DNA, that encodes the RNA component of the large ribosome subunit containing SNFs from the two different parasite species under interrogation. Amplicon identification to single base resolution was achieved. Dynamic chemistry enables preformans in a simple Spin-Tube. The assay allows for a naked-eye read-out of the unique colorimetric patterns coming for sample analysis. Clinical treatment decisions can be made without any ancillary equipment. The proposed Spin-Tube assay not only allows the detection of the presence of Trypanosomatid pathogens, but also differential diagnosis of Leishmaniasis vs. Chagas disease. Multiplexing is achieved by coupling various target-specific abasic probes onto nylon membranes using different array layouts and patterns. Incorporation of SMART-Biotin only into target sequences ensure high specificity. Clinically relevant sensitivity was obtained using our amplification and detection platform, down to a level of detection of 0.001 ng/\u00b5L (8.7 copies per \u00b5L) of gDNA from pathogen. Moreover, 0.1 ng of L. major gDNA was successfully detected when spiked-in with human blood samples. The assay has demonstrated a clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity44. A remarkable achievement was for the first time to succeed in the direct detection of ribosomal RNA. It opens up the possibility for direct detection of Trypanosomatids from biological fluids without any pre-amplification or pre-labelling of target nucleic acids. This breakthrough provides a prototype assay for an innovative PCR free product with many inherent benefits such as lower cross-contamination risk, simplification of protocol, reduction of time-to-results, significantly lower cost, to insure far lower risk of assay result errors. Concluding, we believe that the Spin-Tube developed by our group provides an accurate tool conbianing high sensitivity and specificity, permitting rapid identification and differential diagnosis of Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis. Its clinical value will be an improved patient monitoring and therapeutic decision making. The Spin-Tube opens-up the promise of repertoire of assays for other infectious diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis.",

Step 1: modification of abasic PNAs, which are immobilized onto nylon membranes following specific spot patterns, with the biotinylated aldehyde-modified cytosine (SMART-C-Biotin). This process requires three steps: (i) perfect hybridization between abasic PNAs and PCR amplicons; (ii) generation of a reversible iminium specie between the secondary amine of the \u201cabasic\u201d unit and the aldehyde group of the SMART-C-Biotin nucleobase driven by the templating nucleobase. In this case, SMART-C-Biotin incorporation can be just templated by a guanidine as otherwise the iminium specie is not stable enough to be reduced; and (iii) reduction of the iminium specie by sodium cyanoborohydride to yield a non-reversible tertiary amine within the PNA printed onto the nylon membrane. Step 2: (iv) Biotin labelling with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (Streptavidin-ALP); (v) Incubation with the chromogenic substrate (NBT/BCIP, nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/ 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) which generates a blue precipitate. Step 3: Data analyses by naked-eye reading. Time for the assay: 90 min PCR amplification; 60 min dynamic chemistry reaction; 30 min color development procedure, \u00b13 h total).",
