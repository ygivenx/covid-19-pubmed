Lin et al. retrospectively analyzed 46 patients who were treated with ECMO and demonstrated the good discriminatory power of the RIFILE criteria for in-hospital mortality [area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC), 0.868, p < 0.001] [11].

However, all of the previous studies have mainly focused on the association between AKI and mortality, and none of them have evaluated the potential risk factors of AKI in adult patients [11\u201314].

Informed consent was waived because patient records/information were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. No extramural funding was used to support this work. A total of 681 patients consecutively received ECMO support from January 2005 to November 2014. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they were under 15 years of age (n = 109), if they received ECMO support for less than 24 h (n = 90), if they received ECMO insertion from other hospitals (n = 4), if they had end-stage renal disease or their initial serum creatinine levels were above 353.6 \u03bcmol/L (n = 13), or if they had been receiving continuous renal replacement therapy when ECMO were initiated (n = 66), if they initiated continuous renal replacement therapy on the date of ECMO insertion (n = 77).

The changes in serum creatinine according to the AKI stages were as follows: stage 1, an increase of more than or equal to 26.5 \u03bcmol/L or an increase to more than or equal to 1.5- to 2-fold of the baseline; stage 2, an increase to more than 2- to 3-fold of the baseline; stage 3, an increase to more than 3-fold of the baseline or more than or equal to 353.6 \u03bcmol/L with an acute increase of at least 44.2 \u03bcmol/L or on renal replacement therapy. The maximum AKI stage reached during ECMO support was used to define the incidence of AKI [17]. In-hospital mortality was determined whether a death certificate had been issued or not at 90 d after ECMO insertion. The applied ECMO console was composed of a centrifugal pump and membrane oxygenator.

For multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis for AKI and Cox-proportional hazard analysis for in-hospital mortality were carried out. The variables in the multivariate analysis were chosen by p <0.05 in the univariate analysis. Calibration was done using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test to compare the numbers of predicted and observed in-hospital mortality and AKI. Discrimination was analyzed using AUROC. The best threshold was calculated by obtaining the best Youden index (sensitivity + specificity\u20141). We consider p <0.05 to be statistically significant.

Moreover, stage 3 AKI developed significantly less in the survivors than in the non-survivors. SAPS2 and the serum sodium level were significantly lower in the survivors than in the non-survivors. Ventilator settings, such as positive end expiratory pressure and peak inspiratory pressure before ECMO insertion, did not affect the survival rate. The ECMO pump speed was significantly lower in the survivors than in the non-survivors. Age, causes of admission, causes of ECMO support, mode of ECMO, use of IABP, length of stay before ECMO insertion, duration of ECMO support, initial urine output, BUN, creatinine, RDW and CRP were associated with in-hospital mortality (Table 1). We performed a multivariate Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis to adjust confounding effects among the selected variables. Compared to the non-AKI group, the stage 3 AKI group significantly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality whereas the stage 1 and 2 AKI groups did not (Table 2). In the Kaplan-Meier survival curves according to the stages of AKI, the estimated mean (95% CI) survival in the non-AKI group and the stage 1, 2, and 3 groups were 65.7 (55.2\u201376.2) days, 54.0 (45.8\u201362.3) days, 53.8 (38.7\u201369.0) days and 33.6 (27.9\u201339.4) days, respectively (p < 0.001 by log-rank test). In the post-hoc analysis, the stage 3 AKI group, but not the stage 1 (p = 0.14) or 2 (p = 0.43) AKI groups, showed a significant difference in survival compared with the non-AKI group (Fig 1). With every increment in SAPS2, serum sodium level, and ECMO pump speed (1 score in SAPS2, 1 mmol/L in serum sodium level, and 1,000 rpm in ECMO pump speed), the risks of in-hospital mortality were increased, with HRs (95% CI, p-value) of 1.02 (1.004\u20131.035, 0.01), 1.042 (1.014\u20131.070, 0.003) and 1.333 (1.020\u20131.742, 0.04), respectively (Table 2). We performed a calibration and discrimination analysis of SAPS2, serum sodium level, and ECMO pump speed to predict in-hospital mortality. All three variables were well-calibrated. The AUROC analysis showed the discriminative power of these variables. The cut-off values of SAPS2, serum sodium level, and ECMO pump speed for in-hospital mortality were a score of 69.5, 147.6 mmol/L, and 2.19 x 103 rpm, respectively (Table 3).",

SAPS2 and serum sodium level were also important risk factors of in-hospital mortality. Along with these well-known and expected findings [11\u201313, 18\u201320], we found that the initial pump speed of ECMO was significantly related to in-hospital mortality, with a 33% increased risk for every 1,000 rpm increase. The initial pump speed of ECMO was also a risk factor for both AKI and stage 3 AKI. On the other hand, the blood flow rate of ECMO was not associated with in-hospital mortality or AKI. Why a high pump speed, but not a high blood flow rate of ECMO, increases the risk of in-hospital mortality and AKI is not clear at this time. However, the ECMO pump can induce hemolysis, leukocyte and platelet destruction, and complement activation [21, 22]. Blood flow through the ECMO circuit is driven by centrifugal pump. A rotating impeller in centrifugal pumps spins, which creates a constrained vortex that suctions blood into the pump and propels it out toward the membrane oxygenator [23]. Hemolysis has been reported to be associated with AKI [24]. In addition, Lou et al. found that the pump speed was a risk factor for hemolysis and that hemolysis was associated with adverse outcomes in pediatric patients receiving ECMO [25]. Although we did not evaluate the degree of hemolysis in our patients, we postulate that hemolysis caused by high revolutions of the ECMO pump might result in AKI and in-hospital mortality. To provide stable cardiac output in the VA mode and adequate oxygenation in the VV mode, adequate blood flow should be maintained. Therefore, clinicians raise the ECMO pump speed as much as possible to maintain adequate blood flow. The blood flow rate that was applied to 90% of our patients was less than 4.1 L/min. A high blood flow extracorporeal circuit that pumped up to 7 L/min [26] did not apply to our patients; however, 43.8% (141/321) of our patients were treated with a pump speed higher than the cut-off value of 2.19 x 103 rpm. For these reasons, we speculate that pump speed, but not a blood flow, is a predictor of death in this study.",

In contrast, patients with the VV mode seemed to show slower but poorer outcomes than those with the VA mode.

Recently, the use of the RDW as a simple and inexpensive biomarker to predict mortality in chronic heart failure [18, 28], liver disease [29], and critical illness [30] has increased. Moreover, the RDW has been reported to be associated with many pathological conditions such as colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and contrast-induced nephropathy [31, 32]. Although the exact mechanism of this relationship is not clear, inflammation is a proposed underlying factor [33, 34]. This proposed factor can also be supported by our data, which indicate that the elevated RDW was associated with high CRP levels in the patients. In this study, patients with an RDW greater than 14.1% showed lower RBC indices than did those with an RDW less than 14.1%. Because anemia is a risk factor for AKI [35], the low RBC indices found in the elevated RDW group might contribute to increase the odds of stage 3 AKI occurring.",

First, this study is a retrospective cohort study; however, the variables before ECMO insertion were well retrieved with a less than 10% missing rate. Moreover, this is the largest study to explore the association of AKI and mortality in patients receiving ECMO support [11\u201313]. A low level of missing data and a large number of patients could partially compensate for the weakness of the study design. Second, we classified the patients into their KDIGO stage based only on their serum creatinine concentration. Urine volume is a sensitive marker for the early detection of AKI in patients on ECMO. Decreased urine volume during ECMO treatment and/or on the day of ECMO removal can be attributed to decreased cardiac output following decannulation, and can be correlated with acute cardiorenal syndrome type 1 [27, 36, 37]. Third, we could not provide direct evidence that hemolysis due to a high pump speed resulted in AKI in this study. We should have measured plasma-free hemoglobin, which is an indicator of hemolysis. Furthermore, we did not obtain information on the cannulation site and mean venous pressure in the ECMO circuit. Finally, this study was composed of data from two centers, which could limit the generalizability.",

The initial pump speed of ECMO is associated with in-hospital mortality and strongly related to AKI, especially stage 3 AKI. Therefore, once adequate blood flow is maintained, clinicians must be careful not to further increase the ECMO pump speed. Because the elevated RDW was also strongly related to stage 3 AKI, special attention should be paid to patients with abnormal RDW values to prevent AKI.",
