Because the clinical features of PTB are nonspecific or similar with those of CAP in many cases5,6 and the diagnostic sensitivity of a microscopic examination for diagnosing tuberculosis is only about 60%, it is difficult to accurately discriminate PTB from CAP in the early stages of the diagnostic process, particularly when managing patients with mild symptoms. Moreover, initially inappropriate antibiotic therapy for PTB, particularly newer fluoroquinolones commonly prescribed for CAP, may delay the diagnosis of PTB and can be associated with poor prognosis or drug-resistant PTB7\u20139. Thus, identifying a marker to discriminate PTB from CAP early is important; however, insufficient data for this are available, despite the fact that some studies have suggested several markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, soluble triggering receptor, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, as discriminatory markers10\u201313.",

After red blood cell lysis, cell size and stain intensity were measured by the tungsten-halogen-based optical system of the MPO channel to count and differentiate granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes based on their size and MPO content. This was followed by cell counting and classification according to size, lobularity, and nuclear density, using the laser diode-based optical system of the lobularity nuclear density channel counted. The DNI value was calculated by the following formula and presented as a percentage (%): DNI = [neutrophil and the eosinophil subfractions measured in the MPO channel by a cytochemical MPO reaction] \u2212 [the polymorphonuclear neutrophil subfraction measured in the nuclear lobularity channel by the reflected light beam]17.",

            "text": "Identifying PTB is a troublesome clinical problem in tuberculosis-endemic areas, because failure to discriminate PTB from CAP may result in a considerable public health and economic burden; thus, efforts have been made to distinguish PTB from other respiratory diseases. For example, Liam et al. reported clinical features of 17 patients with PTB that distinguished them from 329 patients with CAP, and showed that a longer duration of symptoms >2 weeks, night sweats, upper lobe involvement, cavity on radiography, and lower WBC count were predictive of PTB6. Ugajin et al. reported that serum procalcitonin was significantly lower in patients with PTB than in patients with CAP; their study included 102 patients with PTB, 62 patients with CAP, and 34 healthy controls11. Kang et al. also found that both serum procalcitonin and CRP levels were lower in 30 patients with PTB than in 57 patients with CAP10. Recently, a new biomarker such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) has been evaluated in sputum of patients with PTB and CAP to discriminate these diseases. The TREM is a novel activating receptors of the Ig superfamily expressed on human myeloid cells, and its expression is upregulated by extracellular bacteria and fungi but is weak in mycobacterial, viral, intracellular bacterial, and noninfectious inflammatory disorders24,25. The soluble form of the receptor, s-TREM-1, can be measured in plasma and other body fluids such as pleural or peritoneal fluid and may differentiate infectious from non-infectious causes. However, the protein was upregulated in sputum among both patients with CAP and PTB, and did not help to differentiate between the two diseases12. To date, sufficient data are not available on accurate and easily applicable markers, and no data exist on utility of the DNI value. Given that the DNI is a convenient test that can provide reliable data rapidly in routine blood tests and considerable discriminating power, even after adjusting for other clinical parameters in a multivariate analysis, the DNI may have an important supplementary role in diagnostic exclusion of PTB from CAP.",

Thus, the proportions of immature granulocytes could be relatively lower in mycobacterial infection than in bacterial or viral infections such as CAP. Actually, three of the 10 PTB patients with bacterial co-infections had relatively higher DNI levels (\u22651.0%) in our study, which supports this hypothesis. Similar to our findings, recent studies that validated the DNI in various clinical scenarios have also demonstrated different DNI levels between bacterial and viral infections or in infectious pyelonephritis versus organ rejection. However, there is a lack of data regarding DNI levels among non-tuberculosis patients with PTB and CAP. In these contexts, our findings could have clinical significance, and although the inflammatory response remains speculative, may partly help to further understanding of the pathophysiology of PTB infection.",

Thus, further prospective studies including various respiratory diseases are needed to accurately evaluate clinical applicability of the DNI for discriminating PTB. Second, we excluded severe cases requiring intensive care unit admission due to severe respiratory failure or shock. However, this was because most cases admitted to the intensive care unit were CAP with extremely high DNI values to up 28% and only a few cases of PTB had clinical instability in actual clinical practice, so we excluded the severe cases. Finally, the study population was relatively small, and the study was conducted at a single center with relatively short study period. Thus, we believe that our findings should be further testified in a validation set. In conclusion, we showed that initial DNI values were lower in patients with PTB than in those with CAP, and that an initially elevated DNI value (>1.0%) may be useful to rule out the possibility of PTB due to its high NPV.",
