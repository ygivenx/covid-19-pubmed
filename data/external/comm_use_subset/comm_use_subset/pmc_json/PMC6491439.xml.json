Its worldwide prevalence is increasing, and the Global Burden of Disease Study has estimated that COPD will be the fourth leading cause of death by 20301. Although pharmacotherapies for COPD have improved, many patients still experience exacerbations of COPD, during which respiratory symptoms worsen acutely, and which determine disease-associated morbidity, mortality, resource burden, and healthcare costs2. After exacerbations, the patients\u2019 symptomatic and pulmonary function recovery takes several weeks, and their quality of life may be seriously degraded. In a large study of commercially insured COPD patients, the total medical and pharmaceutical costs per patient admitted to an emergency department or as a hospital inpatient was approximately $2,000\u2013$40,0003. Hence, it is extremely important to prevent acute exacerbation in COPD patients, but this requires identification of the factors associated with exacerbation.",

Outdoor air pollution also seems to be an important environmental trigger for acute exacerbation of COPD23. A few studies have reported the relationship between air pollution, such as particulate matters (PM10, PM2.5) and harmful gases (NO2, SO2, and O3), and COPD exacerbation7,24\u201326. The deposition of PM in the respiratory tract depends on the size of the particles, and its insufficient clearance may cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response, which is known to cause COPD exacerbations27. Currently, there is insufficient evidence that air pollution is a causative factor of COPD, further studies on this topic are therefore recommended. Although multivariate analysis showed that the correlation between PM10 and COPD exacerbation was not statistically significant in this study, this discrepancy could also be attributed to the powerful factor of temperature.",

First, COPD exacerbation might be under or overestimated in this study, because the exacerbation data analysed were based on claims data, rather than being acquired via an exacerbation diary or patient interview. Second, since the concentration of PM and the detection rate of viruses vary according to region, consideration should be given to the local distribution of patients. We had, in fact, attempted to adjust for the local distributions of patients based on claims data. It is possible to identify the location of the hospital from the HIRA data; however, this adjustment is not perfect, since the patient may visit a hospital far from home. A further study that considers the regional distribution is therefore required. Third, some of the baseline data were adopted from the cohort data, and there was a time difference between cohort data and HIRA data. Thus, CAT, PFT, BMI, smoking status were actually measured after the follow-up period. Also, difference of data measurement period (e.g., daily mean PM10 and weekly viral infection status) should be considered as the limitation of this study. Finally, we did not weight on any variables in multivariate analysis. The methodology we developed in this study is the first attempt in the world, and there has been no reference how to weight in equation. Further study with large number of patients will be needed.",

We demonstrated that the number of exacerbations in the preceding year, being female, a high grade of COPD, the IFV detection rate, and a low lowest temperature were significantly associated with future exacerbation events, according to multivariate analysis. Since exacerbations can negatively impact health status and disease progression31,32, these findings may help to identify the COPD patients who are at risk of exacerbation and to provide intervention as early as possible.",
