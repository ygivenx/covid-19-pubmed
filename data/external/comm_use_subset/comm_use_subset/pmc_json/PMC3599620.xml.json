            "text": "Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus, is a member of the family Reoviridae. Rotaviruses are classified into six, or possibly seven serogroups [1,2]. Rotavirus infections with group A are the major cause of acute diarrhea among newborn animals and humans leading to death [3,4]. Identification of infected calves, in combination with a proper vaccination program, is essential to control BRV successfully. The current methods for the detection and characterization of BRV, which include virus isolation, immunoassay, electron microscopy, and nucleic acid hybridization, are time consuming and laborious [5-7]. On the other hand, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used successfully for the detection and characterization of BRV [8-10]. Unfortunately, PCR assays require sophisticated equipment, which is costly to maintain, and must be performed in specialized laboratories (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and S2).",

This technique eliminates the heat denaturation step for DNA synthesis used in conventional PCR, and relies instead on auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis achieved by a DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity and a set of two specially designed inner and two outer primers. Another important feature of LAMP is a resulting color change following the addition of a fluorescent dye, making it visible to the naked eye. The LAMP assay has been used successfully to detect many pathogens [12-19] and in using reverse transcriptase, it has been further adapted for the detection of RNA viruses [15,16]. The objective of the study reported here was to develop and optimize the reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of group A BRV in calves.",

The NCDV sequence was aligned with the available sequences of 21 isolates (Figure 1 a & b) to identify the conserved regions using Primer Explored V4 soft ware available from: http://primerexplorer.jp/e/. A set of six primers comprised of two outer, two inner, and two loop primers was designed and is shown in Table 2. The inner primers, which are known as the forward inner primer (FIP) and the backward inner primer (BIP), each have two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense and antisense sequences of the target, one for priming the first stage, and the other for self-priming in later stages in the reaction. FIP contains F1c (complementary to F1), and the F2 sequence. BIP contains the B1c sequence (complementary to B1), and the B2 sequence. The outer primers (F3 and B3) were used in the initial steps of LAMP reactions, but later during the isothermal cycling only the inner primers were used for strand displacement DNA synthesis. Two additional loop primers (loopF and loopB) were designed to accelerate the amplification reaction as described [18]. The sequences of the selected primers were compared to VP6 gene sequences [20-22]. All the primers were synthesized and purified by Invitrogen Inc (Guangzhou, China). ",

Second, color change: 1 ml of 10,000 \u00d7 SYBR Green I nucleic acid stain was added to the tube after the reaction.

Samples were compared with a negative control to account for background fluorescence. Third, gel electrophoresis: run on a 1% agarose gel, RT-LAMP reaction end product yields a combination of DNA fragments of varying sizes [11].

The reaction requires only four primers, a Bst DNA polymerase, and a temperature adjustable conventional laboratory water bath. Thirdly, the results of RT-LAMP are visible to the naked eye without the need for electrophoresis. This is attributable to recognition of the target sequence by six primers in the initial stage and by four primers during the later stages of the RT-LAMP reaction.
