            "text": "Genetic drift is defined as stochastic fluctuations in frequencies of alleles in a population. Generally, large populations are less stochastic and undergo less genetic drift than smaller populations. While viruses exhibit very large population sizes, suggesting that the genetic processes in these populations are mostly deterministic, it has been recently appreciated that genetic drift is an important factor in virus evolution. For example, plant viruses undergo severe bottleneck events both when spreading from one plant to another and within an individual infected plant, which leads to frequent founder effects in their populations [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]. Significant contribution of genetic drift has also been proposed for evolution of animal and human viruses, such as norovirus [7], measles [8], hepatitis B virus [9], coronavirus [10], Dengue virus [11], rabies virus [12], and hantavirus [13]. However, accurate determination of the role of genetic drift in evolution of animal viruses is complicated, because genetic drift, a stochastic process, is hard to discern from antigenic drift, which is a selection-driven process associated with individual differences in immune responses of infected hosts. Nevertheless, studies aimed at separating the role of the immune response still find a significant influence of genetic drift in evolution of some animal viruses [14],[15],[16].",

Studies of wheat streak mosaic virus suggest that both mechanisms can contribute significantly to viral evolution [1],[2], but whether this conclusion applies to animal viruses is not clear. The majority of the work on genetic drift in animal viruses has focused on large scale viral populations, comparing viruses either in geographically isolated regions or in consecutive epidemics and, therefore, does not distinguish between the intra- and inter-host genetic drift.",

Multiple studies observed that genetic drift of HIV-1 within an infected individual is several orders of magnitude larger than would be predicted from the total number of infected cells in the body [17],[18],[19],[20],[21]. Several models have been proposed to explain the observed high genetic drift, including multiple selective sweeps [22], metapopulation structure [23],[24] and rare but severe population bottlenecks [25]. All of these models, however, implicitly assume that viral population replicating under homogenous well-mixed conditions should behave as an ideal population. Ideal populations are expected to undergo a certain amount of genetic drift, but real viral populations are also influenced by to the stochastic nature of the biological processes involved in viral replication. Therefore, real viral populations can be expected to have an excess of genetic drift, even under \u201cclose-to-ideal\u201d conditions. The degree to which viral replication process contributes to genetic drift in viral populations is the main interest of our study.",

We developed a system that can be used to accurately measure genetic drift occurring in HIV populations.

To determine experimentally whether or not multiple cycles of viral replication influenced the amount of observed genetic drift, we measured frequency of Vpr-FS-StuI in virions produced during a single cycle of viral replication. The infection was synchronized by washing off non-bound virus after one hour of incubation with C8166 target cells as described above to avoid the increase in genetic drift that happens due to non-synchronous infection. The continuing rounds of viral replication were blocked by addition of antiviral drug nevirapine to the final concentration of 5 uM at 18 hr post-infection. At 72 h post-infection, cell-free virus was collected for the GeneScan analysis and nevirapine-free media was added to cells to allow viral replication and TCID50 measurement. Genetic drift under these conditions was similar to genetic drift in synchronized cultures after multiple rounds of viral replication (Figure 4D and Table 1). Formal comparison of these two conditions did not find a statistically significant difference in observed variance (data not shown). These data are consistent with the idea that the majority of genetic drift in viral populations in culture occurs during the first cycle of replication.",

Yet the fact that a single cell can be infected by more than one virion adds some confusion. The latter problem was avoided in our study by starting experiments at low multiplicity of infection (<0.05), which makes double-infection unlikely. We defined the size of viral population as the total number of cells infected in the culture by the virus added at the beginning of the experiment.",

            "text": "The reasons for the increased genetic drift in HIV populations are not entirely clear. Our work provides strong evidence for the importance of synchronization of infection for reduction of genetic drift. While we have not measured kinetics of infection, it is logical to assume that some of the infections occurred within minutes of addition of virus to cells, while others occurred hours, or even days, later. Indeed, when input virus was washed off after 1 hr during synchronization experiments, viral titers were reduced 10\u2013100-fold as compared to non-synchronized infection (data not shown). As a result, in non-synchronized infections there exists an \u201cearly\u201d virus population, which has a temporal advantage over the \u201clate\u201d viral population. \u201cEarly\u201d population produces new virions faster and contributes to the next generation of infected cells more than the \u201clate\u201d population. Therefore, the small size of the \u201cearly\u201d population defines to a large degree the amount of genetic drift observed in the total population. The potential influence of such non-discrete generations on genetic drift is a well-described phenomenon in population genetics (for review see [28]). Indeed, we found that genetic drift can be significantly reduced when infections are synchronized. Synchronization removes the \u201clate\u201d viral population and, therefore, the total size of viral population becomes much closer to the size of the \u201cearly\u201d population. This results in a more synchronous production of virus particles in the second generation (the major contributor to genetic drift), which becomes discrete reducing the observed genetic drift.",

We believe that the reasons for that lie in differences in metabolic state of target cells, their lifespan, or expression levels of positive and negative factors involved in viral replication. These and other individual differences between target cells can introduce stochastic events into the viral life cycle. For example, it has recently been proposed that positive feedback loops in transactivation of RNA synthesis by viral protein Tat lead to stochastic differences in levels of viral gene expression [29]. As a result, the viral population is randomly divided into actively replicating and latent subpopulations. In general, these and other factors may lead to a non-Poisson distribution in the number of progeny per parent and affect the amount of genetic drift in the population [30]. Interestingly, our data showed that genetic drift in a heterogeneous mixture of C8166 and CEMx174 cells was similar to genetic drift in a more homogeneous C8166 culture, which appears to contradict this prediction. However, it is possible that the differences between target cells in those experiments were not sufficient to result in an observable effect. Additional experiments are needed to establish the relevant biological differences of different target cells and the effect of those differences on genetic drift in viral populations.",

Our results show that this is not the case. Populations of HIV in cell culture undergo approximately tenfold more genetic drift than would be expected from their population sizes. This increase is not sufficient to explain the several orders of magnitude excess in genetic drift of HIV observed in patients [17],[19],[20],[21], but it provides experimental evidence for one source of genetic variation in HIV populations. Indeed, the factors that we proposed to explain the increased genetic drift of HIV in culture should play similar, or even larger, roles in HIV populations in patients. There, infections should be less synchronized than in culture and the individual differences between target cells should be larger than in cell lines or highly stimulated PBMCs that we used in our experiments. Our data suggest that the existing models which explain this excess of genetic drift through multiple selective sweeps [22], metapopulation structure [23],[24] or rare severe population bottlenecks [25] may overestimate the influence of those factors on HIV population genetics. We believe our findings will allow creation of better models describing forces acting on HIV population genetics in an infected person. Genetic drift is a powerful evolutionary force and understanding the factors contributing to it is crucial for our understanding of HIV evolution.",

Due to different insertion lengths, products from Vpr-FS and Vpr-FS-StuI have different length and appear as distinct peaks. The area of each peak is calculated by the PeakScanner and is proportional to the relative amount of each PCR product.",

In addition, any correlation within data from the same experimental replicate is accounted for. This analysis provides estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the fold-difference in variation, adjusted for different population sizes within each experimental condition in relation to the C8166 experimental condition. Any experimental condition where the confidence interval does not contain the value of one has statistically significantly different variance than the C8166 experimental condition.
