The first sequenced genomes were the RNA bacteriophage MS2 [1] and the DNA bacteriophage \u0424-X174 [2]. As important as Drosophila was in shaping the field of genetics and Tobacco Mosaic Virus was in advancing the study of virology and biochemistry, the RNA phage MS2 (family Leviviridae) was fundamental in laying the foundation of molecular biology. Thus, it is important to continue adding to the basic understanding of phages. The observations presented in this study were rather serendipitous, in that the focus was not on searching for natural recombinant bacteriophages. Nonetheless, evidence of a recombination event was revealed during a ssRNA bacteriophage sequencing project [3]. ",

They are classified into two genera (Levivirus and Allolevivirus) which are subdivided into four genogroups (genogroups I and II in Levivirus and genogroups III and IV in Allolevivirus). Investigating the genetic diversity of FRNA phages Vinj\u00e9 et al. [4] conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 32 Levivirus field strains using a 189 bp replicase gene fragment. This study revealed three main clusters: genogroup I, genogroup II and a potential novel group, designated JS, which clustered between genogroup I and genogroup II. The putative JS group, represented by phages, WWTP1_50 and 2GI13, had a >40% sequence diversity in the 189 bp replicase gene sequence when compared to strains from genogroups I and II. As these strains were isolated from widely separated geographical regions (Massachusetts and South Carolina) Vinj\u00e9 et al., [4] proposed that JS may form a stable lineage. This report suggested further genomic sequencing and serological data were needed to confirm whether these strains formed a novel genogroup or whether they were the result of recombination or rearrangement events [5].

In some RNA viruses, RNA recombination events can occur when two or more strains infect the same host. Proposed models for the formation of novel RNA sequences include (i) cleavage and ligation in RNA molecules or RNA secondary structures [6], (ii) replicative template switching whereby the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase) switches from one template to another RNA template, also known as copy choice [5,7], and (iii) RNA transesterification which occurs when the polymerase adds a separate RNA fragment to the 3' terminus of the original RNA template [5].",

In all likelihood, laboratory-applied selective pressure failed to detect or generate a specific recombinant. This failure may not necessarily reflect the lack of recombination or responsible mechanisms that could occur under actual environmental conditions encountered by ssRNA coliphages.",

The investigators noted similar RNA molecules were present in E. coli cells infected with phage Q\u03b2. Chetverin et al., [7] studied this phenomenon by observing the formation of novel sequences in RNA molecules which suggested that this recombination event occurred as a transesterification reaction catalyzed by a conformation acquired by Q\u03b2 replicase during RNA synthesis [5,7]. Nucleotide sequences of recombined RNA molecules non-homologous to the parent RNA were formed in the absence of DNA intermediates, demonstrating an RNA recombination mechanism in the presence of Q\u03b2 replicase [5]. Therefore, it was plausible to have recombination in environmental ssRNA male-specific coliphage (Leviviridae) isolates. ",

As in the Vinj\u00e9 study [4], strains DL52 and DL54 were isolated from separate coastal waters. These phages were placed into the putative JS subgroup using the genotyping methods of Vinj\u00e9 et al. [4]. The objective of this study was to determine whether the existence of a novel JS-like subgroup representing a third Levivirus cluster as proposed by Vinj\u00e9 et al., [4] could be verified. The approach taken here was to compare sequences from the JS strains to nucleotide and amino acid sequence data from entire genomes of 10 levivirus genogroup I strains and 5 levivirus genogroup II strains [3]. Analysis of the novel JS strains provided evidence to determine whether these Levivirus strains clustered to genogroup I, II, a combination of groups I and II or a unique genogroup. To further understand the phylogeny of these JS strains, complete genomic sequencing, amino acid composition, phylogenetic, bioinformatic and statistical analyses were performed.",

Findings that JS strains were highly similar to three out of four genes (maturation, capsid and lysis) in genogroup I MS2-like strains, shared the catalytic site location in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase) gene, had an identical 3\u2019 signature [3] and then greatly diverged along a stretch of the replicase gene all supported the occurrence of a recombination event.

In comparison, genogroup I strain fr was uniformly different from all other genogroup I strains in all four proteins [3]. Cophenetic correlations and bootstrap analysis strengthen the possibility that JS strains were recombinants as the JS strains were only a subgroup of genogroup I and not a novel genogroup. Throughout the Leviviridae family, subgroups emerge within genogroups, however, subgroup strains differ in all four genes from the parent genogroup [3]. It is therefore plausible to propose natural recombination in these two novel JS-like FRNA coliphages as data presented here suggested a specific genetic rearrangement or recombination event in the replicase gene.",

The sliding window approach as used with many recombination programs is based on an arbitrarily chosen window length, thus affecting the sensitivity and accuracy when pinpointing the precise breakpoint [25]. Overall, the use of a variety of recombination algorithms provided a stronger, more rigorous scientific case. When comparing the Levivirus strains, manual alignment provided a more accurate picture of where the recombination event occurred along the genome but it did not provide a statistical analysis. Therefore, statistical analysis in combination with manual alignment resulted in a more confident assessment of recombination.

Four different recombination programs demonstrated one or two breakpoint regions in the replicase gene, signifying a recombination event. The recombination event occurred downstream of the replicase catalytic site thereby maintaining viral integrity and replication function. Thus, primers for oligonucleotide hybridization probes targeting the replicase beyond the catalytic site would not hybridize to JS strains.
