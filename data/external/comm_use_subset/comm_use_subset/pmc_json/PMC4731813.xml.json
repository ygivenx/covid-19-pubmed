As shown in Fig. 2, two different excretion patterns were detected. Cat 1 and cat 3 started shedding viral RNA from day 2\u20134 onwards. For these 2 cats, faecal shedding peaked at 5 dpi, whereupon shedding slightly decreased but remained at high levels until 28 dpi, and even a second small peak was seen at 28 and 21 dpi for cat 1 and 3, respectively. Thereafter, viral RNA levels dropped and both cats had ceased shedding by 84 dpi. Viral RNA quantities were 3\u20134.3 log10 higher with the 3\u2032 RT-qPCR compared to the 5\u2032 RT-qPCR, indicating that only 1/1000 to 1/20000 of all copies detected with the 3\u2032 RT-qPCR are viral genomic RNA copies. Infectivity titration of faecal suspensions in feline enterocyte cultures showed that infectious virus was detectable from day 4 until day 21 (cat 1) or day 28 (cat 3), but that infectious virus titres declined more rapidly than the RT-qPCR titres. In contrast to cat 1 and 3, an aberrant shedding pattern was found in cat 2. At day 2, viral RNA was detected with the 3\u2032 RT-qPCR, but not with the 5\u2032 RT-qPCR. Thereafter, viral RNA was undetectable until 14 dpi. From then, faecal RNA shedding appeared and remained high during the remainder of the experiment, and this cat ultimately stopped shedding 6 months after inoculation (data not shown). Remarkably, no virus replication was observed at any of the time points when faecal samples were inoculated on intestinal epithelial cell cultures.",

For each cat, T and B cell numbers followed a similar trend. All cats showed a small decrease in lymphocyte numbers, which started to resolve from 21 dpi, but this recovery phase was much more pronounced in cat 1 and 3 compared to cat 2. Indeed, whereas lymphocyte numbers remained at pre-infection levels for cat 2, both cat 1 and 3 showed a slight lymphocytosis, which coincided with cessation of shedding in both cats. Monocytes of cat 1 and 2 slightly declined to rise back to pre-infection levels at 28 dpi, but numbers always remained within the normal limits (Fig. 3).",

Although inoculated with the same strain, every cat developed its own quasispecies very rapidly. The most striking difference was found in the viruses shed by cat 2, since 83.8% of all reads showed a 101 bp deletion in the 7b gene, resulting in the formation of a truncated 7b protein with only 143 amino acids instead of 206. Surprisingly, this deletion was no longer found at a later time point (84 dpi) (Table 3), suggesting that viruses with an intact 7b protein were in time selected over the mutants containing the deletion. Other amino acid substitutions were found for this cat in nsp2, nsp5, and nsp6. In cat 1, no amino acid substitutions had occurred by 7 dpi, whereas for cat 3, single amino acid substitutions were found in a minority of the viruses in nsp6, nsp9, nsp12, and the spike protein at 9 dpi.",

Most of the mutations in the spike protein occurred in the globular S1 domain. These changes included deletions (cat 1 and 3) and various amino acid substitutions with possibly a high impact on the charge, polarity and/or glycosylation potential. Amino acid 33 was a hotspot for mutation, since the proline residue had changed to serine in cat 1 (thereby adding a potential N-glycosylation site as predicted by the NetNGlyc server) and leucine in cat 2. In cat 3, 90% of all viruses had a deletion of 8 amino acids in this region, whereas the other 10% showed the proline to serine substitution. All other changes in the S1 region of the spike protein differed between the cats, except for the amino acid substitution K665N that occurred in both cat 1 and 2. In contrast to the S1 domain, the S2 domain of the spike was less affected by mutations, as only one amino acid change had occurred in cat 2 and cat 3. One of these mutations (T1107I in cat 2) occurred in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1), a region that was recently shown to be affected by mutations in many FIP cats2425. If one or more of these mutations in the spike protein can be linked to the reduced in vitro enterocyte tropism requires further investigation. Apart from the spike protein, mutations were also found in other proteins, which again differed between cats. All these results indicate that there is a strong selection pressure during FECV infections, which forces the virus to rapidly evolve, hence resulting in the onset of virus quasispecies that differ among cats.",

            "text": "Analysis of the faecal shedding revealed two distinct excretion patterns. In cat 1 and 3, ingestion of the virus resulted in acute shedding of viral RNA, peaking at 5 dpi, followed by a plateau and a small second peak at 21\u201328 dpi. Finally, shedding declined to undetectable levels at 84 dpi. This RNA excretion pattern is reminiscent of previous reports on experimental FECV infections41920. Virus shedding determined by infectivity titration in feline enterocytes cultures was more transient, since infectivity titres declined already from 14\u201321 dpi, which made the ratio genomic RNA copies/infectious virus titre increase from 3\u20134 log10 during the first week, to up to 8 log10 at 28 dpi. As the decrease in infectivity coincided with the onset of neutralising antibodies in cat 1 and 3, a possible explanation for this lack of correlation is that neutralising antibodies in faeces caused an increased underestimation of infectious virus in the cell culture-based assay. However, it cannot be excluded that this decreased in vitro infectivity was caused by one of the mutations found at this stage of the infection. In sharp contrast to these two cats, cat 2 showed a remarkably different and atypical excretion pattern. This cat lacked the acute shedding phase but suddenly started shedding virus from 14 dpi, without ever showing any of the clinical signs associated with intestinal replication (anorexia and weight loss) seen in the other 2 cats or previously reported FECV UCD infected cats4. The shedding was also more prolonged compared to the other cats. A delay in faecal shedding has been described in one previous study, reporting no faecal shedding before 10 dpi in a cat inoculated with a weak-positive faecal extract26. However, in the present study all cats were infected with a high dose of the same inoculum (1011.3 RNA copies), and another previous study reported the successful inoculation of cats with FECV UCD at a dose as low as 105.7 RNA copies, without noticing this delay4. Another possible explanation for this delay is that the original inoculation failed, and that this cat became infected later on by inadvertent transmission of the virus shed by one of the other cats. This explanation seems also very unlikely, as 1) cats were housed separately and precautions were taken to avoid inadvertent transmission, 2) FCoV RNA was found in saliva of this cat until 2 days after inoculation (data not shown), 3) viral RNA was found in faeces at day 2, indicating passage of the inoculum without any further infection, and 4) the FECV genome in cat 2 differed markedly from the other cats. Indeed, a surprising finding resulting from full genome sequencing was that 83.8% of all viruses shed by cat 2 showed a 101 bp deletion in the 7b gene, resulting in a clearly shorter translation product (143 amino acids instead of 206). So far, the role of the 7b protein remains enigmatic, but this protein is believed to play a crucial role during natural FCoV infections as it is conserved in field strains111627. Up to now, large 7b deletions (56\u2013406 bp) have only been seen in laboratory strains, whereas the gene is intact or only affected by small deletions (max 12 bp) in field strains (both FECV and FIPV)28. Therefore, it is interesting to find that FECV continues to replicate in the absence of an intact 7b, yet there was a positive selection pressure to restore its function as infection progressed. Because no 7b deletion mutants were found in the inoculum, this cannot be the reason why the virus did not replicate in the gut after inoculation. Consequently, the most plausible reason for the lack of acute shedding in cat 2 is that cat-dependent factors (such as harsh digestive conditions, absence of receptors and/or strong innate immunity) restricted the virus to replicate in the intestinal epithelial cells upon oral inoculation, as it is known that some cats are resistant to FECV infection29. However, this cat did suddenly start shedding virus from 14 dpi, and these viruses were not only affected by a 7b deletion, they were also no longer infectious in enterocytes, at least in vitro, as no additional inoculation studies were done with the faecal suspensions of this cat to confirm this feature. Nevertheless, given the huge differences in infectivity compared to the other 2 cats, it can be questioned if this virus was indeed shed by enterocytes, and not by another cell type residing in the intestinal mucosa, since the gradual adaptation to these non-enterocytes can explain the delay and can result in phenotypic changes induced by mutation or altered post-translational modifications. It is known that FECV is not confined to the intestinal epithelial cells but can also be found at low level throughout the body in cells of the monocytic lineage1930. This systemic spread is supported by the cell-associated viraemia detected in the present study, although a recent report indicated that care should be taken when interpreting RT-qPCR-based viraemia data due to the occurrence of false positives at the limits of the assay (from Cq values of 37 onwards)17. In cat 2, a cell-associated viraemia with Cq values of 34.2 and 32.7 was noticed at day 3 and 5 pi, respectively, indicating a systemic spread in this cat. This early uptake by (most probably monocytic) immune cells, in addition to the initial lack of replication in enterocytes, can support the idea that the delayed shedding of mutant viruses that completely lacked in vitro enterocyte infectivity might have resulted from the gradual adaptation to the replication in locally present, mucosa-associated immune cells. The gradual adaptation to non-enterocytes may also give another explanation for the inconsistencies seen between RT-qPCR titres and infectivity titres at later stages of the infection in the other 2 cats.",

            "text": "Full genome sequencing revealed that the virus was faced with a high selection pressure in all cats, but none of the hitherto described FIPV-specific mutations in the spike and 3c genes were ever found during the entire study593132. The onset of mutant viruses is not surprising, since RNA viruses generally have a high mutation rate, resulting in the formation of a genetic heterogeneous virus population (quasispecies) that allows these viruses to rapidly evolve by selecting new variants33. In the present study, notably the amino-terminal part of the spike protein had extensively mutated in all cats, and two of the three cats even showed small deletions (3 and 8 amino acids in cat 1 and 3, respectively) in this domain. The high mutation rate in the S1 part of the spike protein is not really unexpected, since it is known that this region is an important target for immunological selection, and hence antigenic drift2527. However, the presence of deletions and the clearly diminished infectivity of these viruses observed in the present study will make it worthwhile to closer investigate the impact of such mutations. Indeed, to our knowledge, S1 deletions have been observed in various FIPV strains113134, but not in enteric strains, which indicates that this region is potentially required for enterocyte infections, but dispensable for FIP development, as suggested before34. Since this region is also a determinant for the enterotropism of the related alphacoronavirus TGEV3536, one or more of these mutations may give an explanation for the loss of infectivity in enterocyte cultures. In addition, some of the mutations could have an impact on the glycosylation of the virus, and hence change its interaction with C-type lectins that have been shown to be involved in FIPV infection of monocytes373839. Apart from the amino-terminal spike protein, SNPs were also found in the more distal S1 domain, the S2 domain, nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein, and various non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1a. Although it is difficult at this point to make conclusions on the link between any of the observed mutations and the phenotype changes of the virus, the present study indicates that potentially not all faecally shed viruses in healthy cats are actual enterotropic strains, but rather variant forms with a yet unclear cell tropism. Although no FIPV-associated mutations593132 were found and none of the cats developed FIP, this continuous selection pressure on the virus may successively induce FIPV-specific mutations/glycosylation and/or result in mutations/deletions in no longer required (parts of) proteins, explaining the myriad of genetic changes found in FIP affected cats.",

            "text": "FIP development is characterized by extensive changes in blood leukocytes131722, and the severity of the lymphopaenia strongly determines the outcome of the disease1317. In contrast to FIPV, FECV did not induce major changes in peripheral leukocyte subsets, except for a granulocytopaenia in cat 1 during the first 3 weeks after inoculation, and a slight T and B cell lymphocytosis at 56 dpi for cat 1 and 3. This lymphocytosis coincided with the cessation of shedding in these cats. This, together with the fact that shedding did not stop when neutralising antibodies appeared, indicates that the cell-mediated immunity is not only important to overcome FIPV infections, but also to control FECV replication in the gut. FECV infection was characterised by a transient NK cell reduction in peripheral blood, which was most probably the result of migration of NK cells to the intestine or associated lymphoid tissue, since NK cells had an elevated CD11b and CD62L expression (data not shown). FECV infection appeared to be characterised by a transient lowered amount of peripheral Tregs, which can most probably also be explained by specific trafficking to the gut or associated lymphoid tissue. Acute or chronic virus infections are very often associated with an increase in peripheral Treg frequency or function, a feature that was not noticed in the present study. However, gut immunology seems to be substantially different from systemic immunity, notably given the fact that the gut has regulatory systems in place to induce tolerance against commensal bacteria and food antigens, in which Tregs play a vital role. Manipulation of Tregs through accumulation or activation at sites of infection can also cause immune tolerance against pathogenic microorganisms, as exemplified by protozoan (Leishmania major), nematodic (Heligmosomoides polygyrus) and bacterial (Helicobacter pylori) infections4041. Whether these cells also contribute to the long-lasting or persistent shedding of FECV remains to be investigated. In addition, cat 2 showed a deviating pattern in peripheral circulating CD8+ Tregs compared to the other cats. This subset has gained substantial interest in the context of gut immunity to colorectal cancer, graft-to-host disease and rectal HIV/SIV infection, where they are associated with suppressed immunity424344. However, if and how these cells played a role in the aberrant infection pattern of this cat remains elusive, as not much is known about the exact function of these cells.",

Whereas FCoV infections are believed to start with replication in the gut, the aberrant infection pattern shows that FECV has the ability to infect (most probably monocytic) immune cells even in the absence of intestinal replication. In addition, it can be hypothesised that uptake of FECV by mucosa-associated immune cells can induce pressure on the virus to adapt to the replication in these cells, thereby changing some virus\u2019 characteristics, which might give an explanation for the shedding of mutant viruses that completely lacked in vitro enterocyte tropism. Based on all these results, it seems that especially acutely infected animals are the major transmitters of FECV. However, given that FIPV arises by mutations and loses its enterocyte tropism, it warrants future research if variant viruses as detected in the present study also occur during natural infections and can increase the odds for FIP to occur, not only within the cat, but potentially also after transmission to other cats, the latter which might give an explanation for infrequently observed epizootics of FIP.",

Additionally, precautions were taken to prevent exposure to any source of contaminating coronavirus. Briefly, with each handling, sterile clothing and footwear was ensured while litter trays, food trays and water bowls were cleaned and decontaminated daily. To ensure that no contamination could arise from the litter being used, fine sand was washed extensively and autoclaved to serve as litter. The cats were monitored each day during the first week after infection and subsequently on day 9, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84. Each time, the rectal temperature was measured, lymph nodes were palpated, an oral swab was taken and faeces were collected. If faeces were not available, faecal shedding was monitored by inserting a cotton tipped swab (Copan diagnostics, CA, USA) into the rectum. Swabs were suspended in 1 ml DMEM supplemented with 1000 U ml\u22121 penicillin, 0.4 mg ml\u22121 gentamycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Faeces were diluted 1:5 (w:v) in the same medium.
