Compared to traditional culturing methods used in identification, real-time PCR is fast and cost effective. In addition, it can be quantitative and sensitive, in some cases greatly exceeding the sensitivity for conventional testing methods. Commercially distributed kits are available for PCR-based pathogen diagnostics, and PCR is no longer thought of merely as confirmatory to culture. However real-time PCR assays are limited by the quality of the primers and probes chosen. These primers and probes must be sensitive enough to match all target organisms yet specific enough to exclude all others.",

This software asks the user to upload a DNA sequence file, and then finds possible primer/probe sets that meet the assay criteria. Generally a researcher will provide as input a gene region conserved throughout the taxa that the assay is being designed to detect. The software then provides possible primer/probe sets. The researcher chooses a representative signature. If there are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the chosen conserved region, a signature with consensus primers and probes is often chosen. Next a BLAST [2] search is performed to ensure that the primers are not hitting other targets. Finally the signature is verified in vitro with laboratory strains.",

These may appear, for example, as a result of spread by foreign travel or migration. Whole genome based automated signature design [3] presents a great improvement to the common method. However, in addition to better design strategies, methods for automated signature evaluation are needed. As additional sequence data becomes available, it is necessary to regularly reassess the predicted efficacy of a given signature. This analysis must include the predicted false negative and false positive rates for the developed signatures, and consider all available public sequence data.",

These databases were designed to contain only whole genomes and whole segments from segmented genomes. However, the heuristics used to separate whole genomes from partial sequences are not fail-proof due to inconsistency in sequence annotation within the public databases. Consequently many sequences in these databases may show up as false negatives when they are actually just a section or segment of a genome that is not expected to contain the signature, and we manually sorted these sequences into true or false negatives.",

TaqSim uses BLAST searches to find sequences that match both forward and reverse primers and probe. To be reported as a \"hit\" the primers and probe must match in the required orientations relative to one another and the primers must be in sufficiently close proximity. The forward/reverse primers may fall on either the plus or minus strand, so long as the orientation relative to one another is appropriate. There may not be mismatches at the 3' end of either primer. For each hit TaqSim calculates the primer and probe melting temperatures as bound to the candidate hit sequence (accounting for mismatches) based on reaction conditions (reagent concentrations and hybridization temperature), and returns sequences predicted to be amplified. Instead of replicating the various exact reaction conditions reported in each paper, very lenient settings were applied in all cases, essentially removing the screen for primer/probe vs. candidate hit Tm by setting this threshold to 0\u00b0K, and instead checking for specificity by requiring that hits have fewer than 3 mismatches per primer or probe.",

Our database also contains \"glued fragments\", which represent draft genomes \"glued\" together with hundreds of \"N\"s as a simple way to keep the separate contigs associated as part of the same genome.

MSC begins by removing non-unique regions from consideration as primers or probes from each of the target sequences relative to a database of non-target bacterial and viral sequences. The remaining unique regions of each target sequence are mined for all or many candidate signatures, without regard for conservation among other targets, yet satisfying user specifications for primer and probe length, Tm, GC%, avoidance of long homopolymer runs, and amplicon length. All candidate signatures are compared to all targets and clustered by the subset of targets they are predicted to detect. Signatures within a given cluster are equivalent, in that they are predicted to detect the same subset of targets, so by clustering we reduce the redundancy and size of the problem to finding a small set of signatures that detect all targets. Nevertheless, finding the optimal solution of the fewest clusters to detect all targets is an NP complete problem, so for large data sets we use a greedy algorithm to find a small number of clusters that together should pick up all targets. In cases where the target strains of a species are too diverse to be detected by a single signature that hits all target strains, the MSC software groups the targets into genetic clusters to enable signature generation per group. If there are single signatures that are sufficient to detect all targets, then each of those comprehensive signatures is reported. We have used this method to design signature sets for numerous viruses, including Influenza A HA serotypes, foot-and-mouth-disease virus, Norwalk, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, hepatitis A, and other divergent viruses. Many of these signatures have been tested by collaborators at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), USDA, FDA, and elsewhere.",

Even more than 4 genomes are needed for particularly diverse organisms. Thus, older signatures may not perform as well as newly developed signatures from the most up-to-date sequence data. A future study of interest would be a longitudinal look at how these rates continue to change over time as additional sequences become available.
