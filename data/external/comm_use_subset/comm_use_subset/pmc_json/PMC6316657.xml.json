            "text": "The cellular innate immune system utilizes various sensors including Retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to detect viral infection and activate antiviral immune signaling pathways [3,4]. Among these, RIG-I and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) have been implicated in early antiviral immune responses against RSV infection in airway epithelial cells [5]. Deficiency of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD88), which are crucial downstream molecules of RIG-I signaling and TLR signaling, respectively, resulted in an increased viral load in mice, indicating the role of RIG-I and TLR signaling pathways against RSV infection [6]. RIG-I, a cytoplasmic RNA-sensing molecule, has been well-known to trigger antiviral signaling, including the production of type-I interferon [7]. RIG-I comprises 2 N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a helicase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). Upon recognition of viral RNAs by the helicase and CTD domain of RIG-I, the two N-terminal CARDs are exposed and interact with TRIM25, a E3-ubiquitin ligase. TRIM25 delivers the K63-linked polyubiquitin chain to the RIG-I CARDs to induce RIG-I oligomerization and subsequent interaction with MAVS [8]. Since TRIM25 plays a crucial role in RIG-I signaling pathways, several viral proteins target TRIM25 to evade RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses [9]. For example, NS1 of influenza A virus interacts with TRIM25 to inhibit its oligomerization and subsequent RIG-I ubiquitination [10].",

            "text": "Like other viruses, RSV has evolved several strategies to antagonize antiviral immune responses [11]. The role of Nonstructural Proteins 1 and 2 (NS1 and NS2) in suppressing innate immune signaling has been particularly highlighted [12,13,14]. The RSV NS2 protein has been shown to interact with RIG-I CARDs to suppress RIG-I signaling [15]. NS1 protein is also known to co-localize with MAVS, suggesting its role in suppressing RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses [16]. Interestingly, the NS1 and NS2 of RSV are capable of inducing the degradation of key molecules in RIG-I signaling and type-I interferon signaling including RIG-I, IRF3, IRF7, TBK1 and STAT2, to suppress antiviral responses by forming a large degradative complex [17]. In the previous study, ectopic expression of NS1 or NS2 sufficiently inhibited RIG-I-mediated interferon production, indicating that NS1 is also capable of suppressing RIG-I signaling by itself like NS2 [18]. However, the underlying mechanism and molecular target of NS1-mediated RIG-I signaling inhibition remain elusive yet. In the current study, we explored the possibility that NS1 proteins of RSV interfere with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying the direct inhibition of RIG-I signaling by NS1/2 of RSV.",

Next, we have tested whether RIG-I ubiquitination is affected by the presence of NS1. As shown in Figure 2B, both NS1 and NS2 suppressed the TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-IN.

To further dissect the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25, we determined the domain of TRIM25 that is responsible for this interaction using truncated TRIM25 domains. FLAG-tagged NS1 was expressed along with the RING domain, B-Box/CCD domain, or SPRY domain of TRIM25 and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. As depicted in Figure 3D, the SPRY domain sufficiently interacts with NS1, whereas the RING or B-Box/CCD domains do not show any interaction.

Thus, the interaction between RIG-IN and MAVS upon virus infection was analyzed. As shown in Figure 4A, clear interaction between FLAG-tagged MAVS-CARD-proline rich domain (PRD) and GST-tagged RIG-IN was detected by co-IP. However, RSV infection resulted in decrease of both RIG-IN ubiquitination and the interaction between RIG-IN and MAVS-CARD, supporting that RSV is capable of suppressing RIG-I ubiquitination and the subsequent RIG-I interaction with MAVS (Figure 4A). To further confirm the effect of NS1 on RIG-I activation, the effect of NS1 ectopic expression on RIG-IN interaction with MAVS was examined. FLAG-tagged MAVS-CARD-PRD and GST-tagged RIG-IN was co-expressed with increasing amounts of V5-tagged NS1 followed by a co-immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-FLAG antibody. As seen in Figure 4B,C, the clear interaction between RIG-IN and MAVS-CARD-PRD was decreased by NS1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that RSV NS1 expression diminishes the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Since TRIM25 oligomerization is crucial for its E3-ligase activity, it has been tested whether NS1 suppresses TRIM25 E3-ligase activity by interfering the oligomerization. As seen in Figure 4D, expression of NS1 did not affect the interaction between HA-tagged TRIM25 and V5-tagged TRIM25 while interaction between V5-tagged TRIM25 and NS1 was detected.

Moreover, several viruses utilize their proteins to interfere with TRIM25 activation and subsequent RIG-I activation. For instance, the Influenza NS1 binds to TRIM25 and inhibits TRIM25 multimerization [10]. The SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein binds to TRIM25 SPRY and disrupts RIG-I ubiquitination [23]. In this study, the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 was demonstrated. Since several studies have shown that TRIM25 migrates to the mitochondria upon viral infection to interact with MAVS [24], the interaction between MAVS and NS1 might be a result of the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25. As expected, NS1 inhibited the interaction between RIG-I CARD and MAVS. These results clearly indicate that NS1 is capable of suppressing RIG-I activation by targeting TRIM25 and inhibiting RIG-I ubiquitination through TRIM25. We have shown that NS1 could suppress the interferon-\u03b2 promoter activity induced by RIG-IN and MAVS, indicating that NS1 is also capable of suppressing downstream signaling. This can be explained by previous studies showing that NS1 can trigger the degradation of critical downstream molecules such as IRF3. Nonetheless, we have shown that NS1 can suppress TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-IN without affecting its amount and that its effect on RIG-IN-mediated interferon-\u03b2 promoter activity can be reversed by an excessive amount of TRIM25. These results indicate that inhibition of TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination by NS1 contributes to the suppression of RIG-I signaling, at least in part.",

Given that the SPRY domain is responsible for interaction with RIG-I, a possible molecular mechanism is that NS1 binds to TRIM25 and sequesters it to prevent its interaction with RIG-I. However, we could not observe a significant reduction in interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25 by NS1 (Data not shown). Further studies are needed to identify the detailed molecular mechanism of RSV NS1-mediated TRIM25 dysfunction.",

In a previous study, RSV NS1 and NS2 have been shown to exist as homo- or heterodimers in mammalian cells. The RSV NS1-NS2 dimer was detected in mitochondria, suggesting that NS1 and NS2 can cooperate to suppress RIG-I signaling [18]. It is also possible that the dimer of RSV NS1 and NS2 interacts with TRIM25 and RIG-I CARD through each NS protein interacting with TRIM25 or RIG-I CARD. Although we could not observe a significant synergistic effect of NS1 and NS2 co-expression in terms of suppression of RIG-I ubiquitination (Figure 1C), the NS1 and NS2 interaction may have additional functions in RIG-I signaling. For instance, it is possible that the NS1/NS2 complex induces RIG-I degradation followed by suppression of RIG-I K63-ubiquitination for complete inhibition of the RIG-I signaling pathway.",
