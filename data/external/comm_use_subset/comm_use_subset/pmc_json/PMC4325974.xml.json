Furthermore, we speculated that NFV acting on a nonprotease viral target would be improbable and that its antiviral activity is more likely due to one or more of its effects on host cells, which could impair efficient viral replication. We therefore investigated mechanism of action of NFV on HSV-1, by attempting to identify host cell or viral targets of the drug in vitro.",

The protease coding sequence contained an N-terminal HA tag and each substrate contained an N-terminal FLAG tag; all vectors were synthesized by Blue Heron Biotech, LLC. Each substrate was expressed alone or in combination with the protease, in the presence of NFV or a vehicle control. Expression was under the control of the CMV6 promoter. The plasmid pEGFP-N2, which expresses a GFP variant from the CMV immediate-early promoter, was used to monitor transfection efficiencies. Transfection was performed using Mirus TransIT-293 reagent (MIR 2700) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NFV (10 \u00b5M final concentration) or DMSO (0.1% final concentration) was added to the cells concurrently with the DNA and transfection reagent. Cultures were incubated 24 hours with no change of medium, at which time the cells were harvested on ice by scraping into RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablets). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Extracted proteins (10 \u00b5g/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes by tank transfer overnight. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma), recognizing the tag on the scaffold protein, anti-HA monoclonal antibody, clone HA-7 (Sigma), and recognizing the tag on VP24.",

HSV-1 infection results in an increase in the level of Akt phosphorylation (Figure 3), as has been previously described [24]. The Akt inhibitor LY294002 completely suppressed Akt phosphorylation in HSV-1 infected cells, but NFV did not reduce the levels of phosphorylated Akt even at drug concentrations that potently block virus production (Figure 3). Furthermore, LY294002 treatment of HSV-1 infected HF cells did not reduce the production of infectious virus by plaque assay (not shown), consistent with published data [24]. Therefore, it is unlikely that the documented inhibition of NFV on AKT activation plays a role in the drug's inhibition of HSV-1.",

We therefore explored the effects of NFV on HSV-1 infected HF cells by transmission electron microscopy. Normal numbers of virus particles appeared to be produced in NFV-treated cells. Similar numbers of capsids were observed in the nucleus of untreated and NFV-treated cells (approximately 39 and 44, resp., Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). However, compared with untreated cells, capsids in NFV-treated cells appeared to be disproportionately retained within the cytoplasm (~14 versus 79, resp.), in which virus particles were more often located outside the plasma membrane (~51 versus 3), suggesting a block in virus maturation or egress. In addition, in contrast to those in the cytoplasm of untreated cells, cytoplasmic capsids in NFV-treated cells were rarely observed to be enveloped (~9 versus 0 in the fields shown; Figures 4(c) and 4(d)). Interestingly, although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR), and autophagy are well known effects of NFV [16, 26\u201329], neither ER dilation nor the abundance of double-membrane bound vesicles consistent with autophagosomes appeared consistently different between NVF-treated and untreated HSV-1-infected cells.",

The apparent change in molecular weight of these viral proteins was estimated to be consistent with the reduction in glycosylation [30\u201332]. To assess the effect of NFV on protein glycosylation in HSV-1-infected cells, Eastern blotting was performed using lectins PNA, RCA-I, WGA, and ConA (Figure 5(a)). Compared to untreated or IDV-treated cells, NFV resulted in a marked reduction in staining by PNA, RCA-I, and WGA indicating decreased addition of galactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine [33, 34]. In contrast, ConA staining was not appreciably reduced, suggesting relatively normal levels of oligomannose-type N-glycans. NFV resulted in a clear alteration in the subcellular localization of HSV-1 gB (Figure 5(b)) by immunofluorescent antibody staining. Compared with control treatments in which viral envelope glycoprotein staining uniformly delineated the plasma membrane of HSV-1-infected HF cells, with NFV treatment staining appeared predominantly perinuclear, suggesting improper trafficking to the cell surface. Consistent with the electron microscopy results, using immunofluorescence, no increase in LC3-II staining, a marker of autophagy, was apparent (data not shown).",

In this study, we specifically explored the mechanism(s) by which NFV might inhibit production of infectious HSV-1 in vitro. We found that NFV acts on HSV-1 late in virus production, without a detectable effect on late viral gene expression. Furthermore, abundant virus particles were observed within infected cells, though envelopment and release of virus appeared to be substantially diminished. This is consistent with a recently published study by Kalu et al., which also reported that NFV blocked HSV-1 maturation and egress [25].",

No resistance to NFV could be selected under conditions that readily resulted in acyclovir-resistant HSV-1, which is again consistent with findings by Kalu et al. [25]. Though NFV-resistant HSV-1 may well be isolated using other conditions, this finding suggests a relatively high barrier to resistance in vitro and suggests a mechanism of action on a host cell function required for virus production, rather than a direct effect on a viral target [37\u201341].

The finding that NFV resulted in impaired viral protein glycosylation and trafficking is consistent with these processes and again validates the recent findings by Kalu et al. [25]. Of note, based on ConA staining, N-linkage of immature (high mannose) carbohydrates appeared relatively normal [33]. These mannose structures are largely assembled in the cytoplasm, whereas trimming and modification of more complex sugar residues occur in the ER and Golgi. We found that the impairment of viral glycoprotein processing is at least one mechanism by which NFV reduces infectious HSV-1 production. Agents that induce ER stress, such as thapsigargin, similarly interfere with HSV-1 glycoprotein posttranslational processing and production of infectious virus [31]. Numerous studies have reported that tunicamycin, which blocks the synthesis of the N-acetylglucosamine-lipid intermediates, and other inhibitors of protein glycosylation decrease the infectious yield of HSV-1 in vitro [44\u201346]. Furthermore, tunicamycin does not affect the level of late viral gene product expression, and normal appearing capsids were noted within the cytoplasm, similar to the effects we observed with NFV. It is unclear, however, whether impaired HSV-1 envelope protein glycosylation would block virus egress based on studies using cell lines deficient in N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase activity, in which virus yield was only mildly reduced [47].",

HSV-1 encodes genes to block autophagy in infected cells, including infected cell protein (ICP) 34.5, which is required for neurovirulence [48]. Increased levels of autophagy can reduce production of infectious HSV-1 similarly to NFV, with relatively normal viral gene expression and formation of viral particles that are retained within cells [49, 50]. We were not able to formally show that NFV increased autophagy in HSV-1 infected cells under the conditions used. NFV treatment appeared to result in retention of cytoplasmic virus particles within single membrane-bound vesicles that could be late autophagosomes as in other reports [49, 50]. However, pathognomonic double-membrane structures were not convincingly observed in greater numbers in NFV-treated versus untreated HSV-1-infected cells nor were we able to show that NFV increased LC3-II staining during HSV-1 infection. Autophagy can be difficult to demonstrate [51] and cannot currently be excluded as a potential contributor to the effect of NFV on HSV-1 or other HHVs [48].",

However, because of its activity against a broad range of tumor cell types, there is intense interest in repositioning NFV as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, perhaps at higher doses than those for ART [11, 42, 52]. NFV could also be beneficial in the treatment or suppression of infection with HSV and other HHVs, particularly in the setting of resistance to first-line antivirals, in patients with cancer and/or HIV.
