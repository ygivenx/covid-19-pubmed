The genus Ebolavirus currently has five members: Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Reston virus (RESTV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Ta\u00ef Forest virus\n[1]. Filoviruses induce lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in both humans and non-human primates, while RESTV infection in humans is probably subclinical, yet it also causes highly lethal VHF in macaques\n[2,3]. RESTV epizootics among cynomolgus macaques emerged in 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1996. In all of these epizootics, the cynomolgus macaques originated in a single primate breeding facility in the Philippines\n[4]. Although the natural reservoir of RESTV remains unknown, RESTV was isolated from pigs in the Philippines, in addition to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type-2 in 2008\n[5]. Considering the social impact of ebolaviruses, it is important to understand the endemic and epizootic status of RESTV in the Philippines.",

Using serum specimens collected from cynomolgus macaques during a RESTV outbreak in the Philippines in 1996, we attempted to elucidate the significance of neutralizing antibodies to RESTV in viral clearance. We have previously established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) specific for RESTV nucleoprotein (NP)\n[6-8]. These assays are useful tools for investigating the signs of RESTV infection in cynomolgus macaques. In human cases, antibody responses against ebolaviruses have been analyzed extensively: IgG responses to NP and other structural proteins (e.g., VP40 and VP35) have been shown to correlate with asymptomatic and surviving cases, and neutralizing antibody responses targeting the ebolaviruses glycoprotein (GP1,2) appear to be the major indicator of protective immunity\n[9].",

The assays based on recombinant NP are sensitive for the detection of RESTV-specific antibodies. On the other hand, anti-GP1,2 antibodies are elicited in EBOV-infected human cases and are believed to have protective roles against lethal EBOV infection\n[21,22]. In the present study, in order to gain insight into the IgG responses during the recovery from infection with RESTV, anti-NP, anti-GP1,2, and neutralizing antibodies and the level of viremia in the serum specimens were analyzed. The data presented herein showed that the anti-GP1,2 response, rather than the anti-NP response, was correlated with both the lack in viremia and the neutralizing activities in the sera of RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. There may be at least two possibilities for the lack of anti-GP1,2 IgG in the acute phase samples. It is known that soluble GP (sGP), which does not contain membrane anchor, is secreted during ebolaviruses infection, and it can absorb the anti-GP1,2 antibodies\n[23]. The other possibility is that apoptosis of lymphocytes is induced during RESTV infection and the resulting host immune responses may thus be abrogated. Although the precise mechanism of action is still unknown, it is likely that no IgG responses to RESTV GP1,2 are induced in the cynomolgus macaques during the acute phase of infection.",

We focused on the circulating inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques and examined their relationship with convalescence. We thus found the concentrations of several proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IFN\u03b3, IL8, IL-12, and MIP1\u03b1, to be significantly higher in convalescent sera than in non-convalescent sera. Gupta et al.

Although the exact profiles of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines shown in our study are different from those reported by Gupta et al., these differences are considered most likely to be due to differences among ebolaviruses (RESTV vs. BDBV), host species (cynomolgus macaques vs. humans), and differences related to the disease phase when the samples were obtained.

Since all of the cynomolgus macaques involved in the epizootic were euthanized at the affected facility, the actual fate of the cynomolgus macaques was not clear, and some might have survived the infection. Our data obtained using the sera from cynomolgus macaques in the RESTV epizootic showed higher IL-1ra responses in the convalescent phase than in the non-convalescent phase (Figure\n1).

The serum specimens in the affected facility were collected under quarantine of the Philippines. Nineteen of the 27 samples were previously subjected to an antigen capture ELISA. Nine of the samples were found to be RESTV antigen-positive, and the remaining 10 were considered to be antigen-negative\n[15]. The serum specimens were treated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and virus in the cynomolgus macaque serum samples were inactivated. As negative controls for the IgG-ELISA and IFA, we used serum samples from 102 cynomolgus macaques collected at the Tsukuba Primate Research Center (TPRC) in Japan. As positive controls for the IgG-ELISA and IFA, two rabbits were immunized four times with the histidine-tagged ectodomain of the RESTV glycoprotein (GP1,2) (RESTV GP1,2\u0394TM). The histidine-tagged RESTV GP1,2\u0394TM of a 1996 RESTV\n[28] was prepared and purified as described below. The sera were collected from the rabbits, inactivated, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. The experiments with animals were performed in accordance with the Animal Experimentation Guidelines of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the institute (Permit number: 990163 and 109075).",

Briefly, 293 T cells were prepared in 24 well plates at 20-30% confluency. The cells were transfected with pKS336-RESTV-GP1,2 using FuGENE HD.
