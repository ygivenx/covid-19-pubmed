            "text": "Purpura with fever is a worrisome finding in children, raising the possibility of meningococcemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or drug eruption [1]. A common cause of purpura among pediatric patients is Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein Purpura (HSP), with the classic presentation of dependent purpura, renal disease, abdominal pain, and arthritis or arthralgias. Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy (AHEI), however, is a less common etiology of pediatric purpura with approximately 500 reports in the literature. AHEI presents with purpuric lesions of the face, ears, and extremities, and nonpitting edema of the extremities. Although the lesions have a dramatic onset over a 24- to 48-hour period, the child with AHEI is nontoxic appearing without visceral involvement [2]. Patients with AHEI usually make a complete recovery within 1\u20133 weeks of presentation with supportive care only [3]. Recurrence of symptoms is rare, described in only three other published reports to our knowledge [4].",

It classically presents with rapidly progressive purpuric lesions over the face, extremities, and bilateral ears, accompanied by nonpitting edema of the extremities. The presence of bilateral auricular swelling and purpura in a well-appearing child should raise particular clinical suspicion for AHEI. Fewer than 10% of patients diagnosed with AHEI exhibit extracutaneous manifestations, which include glomerulonephritis, abdominal pain, arthralgia, testicular torsion, and intussusception [6]. Diagnosis is clinical and can be made without a skin biopsy. If skin biopsy is performed, a leukocytoclastic vasculitis is present with IgA immunofluorescence in approximately one-third of patients [6]. Laboratory testing is typically reassuring without evidence of renal or hematologic compromise. Some physicians have made the diagnosis via telemedicine, relying on cellphone photos to monitor the progression of the disease [7].",

Viruses including rotavirus, herpes simplex virus, and adenovirus have been implicated [3]. Additionally, antibiotics and vaccinations have been identified as triggers [8]. Although the exact triggering pathogen for AHEI is rarely identified, our case demonstrates that coronavirus can precede this disease. Our patient's symptoms of cough and conjunctivitis are consistent with coronavirus infection, and the result is unlikely to be a false positive given the low rate of coronavirus detection observed in healthy children [9]. Specifically, coronavirus NL63 has been associated with petechial rash, but this is the first case to our knowledge to be associated with AHEI [10].",

Given the improvement in our patient's purpura by 48 hours after onset, we made the decision not to administer corticosteroids. Our case illustrates that symptoms of AHEI can have rapid onset as well as swift resolution without steroid intervention. This suggests that some previously reported patients may have improved even without corticosteroids, though at least one case has noted relapse of symptoms when steroids were removed [7]. While use of corticosteroids remains controversial, most reports suggest that corticosteroids only be considered in severe presentations with complications or inability to maintain fluid intake [7, 11, 12].",
