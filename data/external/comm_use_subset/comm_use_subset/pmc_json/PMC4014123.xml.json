Viral sialidases are critically required for viral propagation because they are required for release from the host cell (Kim et al., 2013 \u25b6). Drug discovery of inhibitors targeting sialidase has focused on either synthetic compounds through random screening or substrate (N-acetylneuraminic acid) mimics. However, these studies have mainly been targeted against sialidase from the influenza virus. There are several inhibitors that mimic the substrate, including zanamivir (Relenza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu; a cyclohexene derivative), peramivir (a cyclopentane-based inhibitor) and A-315675 (a pyrrolidine-based inhibitor; Kim et al., 2013 \u25b6). All of these compounds are based on 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en), a putative transition-state analogue. At present, the existence of drug-resistant strains against zanamivir (Gubareva et al., 1998 \u25b6), oseltamivir (Gubareva et al., 2001 \u25b6) and other antivirals (Tambi\u0107 Andrasevi\u0107, 2004 \u25b6) have spurred on the need to discover innovative antiviral agents.",

The need to combat these superbugs mandates the development of new drugs overcoming antibacterial resistance. Various pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae express sialidases. These enzymes specifically catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids from glycoconjugates (Shinya et al., 2006 \u25b6) and play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of a number of microbial diseases, including cholera, enterotoxaemia, gas gangrene and pneumonia (Corfield, 1992 \u25b6; Rood, 1998 \u25b6). Therefore, bacterial sialidases have recently emerged as a prominent target for the treatment of bacterial infections (Nguyen et al., 2010 \u25b6; Woo et al., 2011 \u25b6). The latest studies on sequelae of sepsis and septic shock have focused on understanding the roles of bacterial pathogenic factors (Rittirsch et al., 2008 \u25b6). Moreover, studies using a sialidase deletion mutant from P. aeruginosa showed that bacterial sialidase acts in the initial stages of pulmonary infection by targeting glycoconjugates and biofilm production (Soong et al., 2006 \u25b6).",

In order to understand how natural geranylated flavonoids interact with sialidase, we determined the crystal structure of the Cp-NanI catalytic domain (NanICD; residues 243\u2013694) in complex with diplacone at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution. The structural information on Cp-NanICD and comparison with the models of human sialidases provide an insight into how the natural geranylated flavonoids can behave as antibiotics and led to the elucidation of a strategy for the design of advanced inhibitors for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by C. perfringens.",

For bacterial expression, the NanI catalytic domain without the lectin domain (NanICD; residues 243\u2013694) was amplified from C. perfringens genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET-23d expression vector (Novagen), which contains a direct C-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag. Cp-NanICD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) cells. The transformed cells were cultured in Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 \u00b5g ml\u22121 ampicillin at 310 K. The bacterial cells were induced at 293 K for 20 h with 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Pharmacia) at an OD600 of 0.6 and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min. The harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication, after which the lysate was centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was applied to an immobilized metal-affinity chromatography on nickel\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Peptron) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). The column was then washed with ten bed volumes of wash buffer. The His6-tag fused protein bound to the column was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). The samples were then purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare Life Science) pre-equilibrated with gel-filtration buffer (25 mM CHES\u2013HCl pH 9.5, 200 mM NaCl), after which the fractions containing Cp-NanICD protein were collected. The protein was concentrated to 21.8 mg ml\u22121 using an Amicon Ultra-15 30K (Millipore) and was stored at 193 K.",

Crystals grew at 293 K in 2 \u00b5l drops comprised of equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution consisting of 20%(w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate. The crystals were soaked in soaking solution [0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 20%(w/v) PEG 3350, 10%(w/v) glycerol, 5 mM diplacone, 5%(v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide] for 2 h at 293 K. The crystals were cryoprotected by transfer into cryoprotectant [20%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate] and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. A complete data set for Cp-NanICD with diplacone at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution was collected at 100 K using an ADSC Q315r detector on beamline 5C at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) using an X-ray beam with a single wavelength (0.9795 \u00c5). The crystal belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 69.1, b = 72.6, c = 97.1 \u00c5. Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL-2000 suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997 \u25b6). The structure of Cp-NanICD with diplacone was determined using the molecular-replacement method with MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010 \u25b6) in the CCP4 suite (Winn et al., 2011 \u25b6) using the apo crystal structure of Cp-NanICD (PDB entry 2vk5; Newstead et al., 2008 \u25b6) as the phasing model. Automated model building and refinement of NanICD complexed with diplacone were performed with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011 \u25b6) in the CCP4 suite and phenix.refine (Adams et al., 2010 \u25b6). phenix.ligandfit (Terwilliger et al., 2006 \u25b6) was used for automated ligand building of the diplacone in Cp-NanICD, and manual model building was performed with Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004 \u25b6). Weak electron-density regions (residues 692\u2013694) were excluded from the final structure. The Ramachandran statistics were calculated using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010 \u25b6). 96.2% of the residues were in the preferred regions and 3.8% of the residues were in allowed regions. A 2F\no \u2212 F\nc composite OMIT map of diplacone contoured at 1.0\u03c3 was generated with FFT (Read & Schierbeek, 1988 \u25b6) in the CCP4 suite. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of Cp-NanICD with diplacone have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession code 4l2e. Data-collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 \u25b6.",

In this way, increasing the concentration of diplacone led to a decrease in both the initial velocity (v\ni) and the steady-state rate (v\ns) (Figs. 1 \u25b6\na, 1 \u25b6\nb and Supplementary Fig. S3a). The progress curves obtained using various concentrations of the inhibitors were fitted to equation (2) (Supplementary Fig. S3a) to determine v\ni, v\ns and k\nobs. The results for diplacone were fitted to the a slow-binding process (equation 3; Supplementary Fig. S3a), illustrating a hyperbolic dependence of k\nobs on the concentration of bacterial sialidase (Fig. 1 \u25b6\nc). Based on the above kinetic observations, we conclude that the reaction follows a time-dependent kinetic mechanism (Fig. 1 \u25b6\nd). From the results of the fit, values of 0.201 \u00b1 0.003 and 0.0017 \u00b1 0.004 min\u22121 were obtained for k\n5 and k\n6, respectively. Using these values derived from k\nobs gives a calculated K\ni\napp value of 0.065 \u00b1 0.008 \u00b5M, which is in agreement with the K\ni (0.04 \u00b5M) value determined using double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver\u2013Burk and Dixon plots; Supplementary Fig. S4). The hyperbolic dependence observed with the inhibitors suggests that diplacone inhibits sialidase by the rapid formation of an enzyme complex () which slowly isomerizes to form a modified enzyme complex () (Fig. 1 \u25b6 and Supplementary Fig. S3b).",

To investigate the mode of binding of diplacone to the enzyme, we determined the structure of Cp-NanI in complex with diplacone. The structure of Cp-NanICD in complex with diplacone shows little deviation from previously published structures. The \u03b2-propeller fold within the apo structure (PDB entry 2vk5; Newstead et al., 2008 \u25b6) and the structure of Cp-NanI in complex with the substrate Neu5Ac (N-acetyl\u00adneuraminic acid; PDB entry 2bf6; Newstead et al., 2008 \u25b6) show root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.s) relative to our structure of 0.12 and 0.11 \u00c5, respectively (Figs. 2 \u25b6\na and 3 \u25b6\na). Consistent with our kinetic analysis, diplacone was bound to the enzyme active site. The principal interactions between the inhibitor and enzyme were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The 3\u2032,4\u2032,5,7\u2032-hydroxyl-4-oxo group and the O atom at the 1-position of diplacone form direct or indirect hydrogen bonds with side chains of the tri-arginyl cluster (Arg266, Arg555 and Arg615) as well as residues Arg285, Asp328, Phe353, Tyr485, Gln493, Thr538, Tyr655 and the main chain of Ala292, in addition to three water molecules (W1, W2 and W3) (Fig. 2 \u25b6\nb and Supplementary Fig. S6). The flavanone backbone of diplacone also displays hydrophobic contacts with Ile327, Phe347, Phe460, Tyr485 and Tyr655, which orientate the inhibitor correctly and stabilize the bound conformation.",

The geranyl group made a suitable hydrophobic interaction with four aromatic residues: Phe353, Trp354, Phe460 and Tyr587. Therefore, diplacone (IC50 of 0.11 \u00b5M) showed an approximately 150-fold higher inhibitory effect compared with eriodictyol lacking the geranyl group (IC50 of 16.4 \u00b5M). The hydroxyl group at C3\u2032 of diplacone also made additional hydrogen bonds with the main-chain N atom of Ala292. Introducing methylation of this position (3\u2032-O-methyldiplacone, IC50 of 14.3 \u00b5M) or the adjacent C4\u2032 (4\u2032-O-methyldiplacone, IC50 of 12.9 \u00b5M) would disturb this hydrogen bond and cause steric hindrance with the main chain of Ala292 and the side chains of Ile327 and Phe347. On the other hand, eliminating the C3\u2032 hydroxyl group (mimulone, IC50 of 6.1 \u00b5M) does not lead to structural clashes with the protein but prevents hydrogen-bond formation. Therefore, maintaining the geranyl and C3\u2032 hydroxyl group is important for the further development of diplacone-based Cp-NanI inhibitors.",

Asp291 in the diplacone and Neu5Ac complexes, which is a mechanistically important acid/base catalyst (Crennell et al., 1993 \u25b6), rotates by approximately 120\u00b0 compared with the apo structure to make a hydrogen bond to the 3\u2032-hydroxyl of diplacone or the 4\u2032-hydroxyl of Neu5Ac. Moreover, the rotation of Asp291 also induces a conformational change of Ile327 in the apo enzyme compared with both complexes. Relative to the diplacone-bound complex, in the Neu5Ac-bound complex Ile327 moves to make a suitable hydrophobic interaction with the \u03b2-carbon of Asp291 and the 5\u2032-acetamide moiety of the Neu5Ac molecule. Apo Cp-NanICD and the diplacone complex showed a hydrogen-bond interaction mediated by one water molecule (W1), the position of which nearly overlaps with the 4\u2032-hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac. On the other hand, the hydrogen bond between Asp328 and the 4\u2032-hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac seems to be responsible for inducing the conformational change of Ile327. Cp-NanICD in complex with diplacone has the same side-chain orientation of Asp291 as in the substrate (Neu5Ac) complex. In addition, an extra water molecule (W1) rather than the 4\u2032-hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac stabilizes the diplacone complex. Therefore, together with the kinetic inhibition assay, the structure of the Cp-NanICD\u2013diplacone complex suggests that diplacone binds to the same substrate-binding site and acts as a competitive inhibitor.",

To predict how diplacone would interact with human silalidase counterparts, we modelled human sialidases (Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4) using the previously determined Neu2 structure and compared the specificity of diplacone with C. perfringens and human sialidases (Fig. 4 \u25b6\na and Supplementary Fig. S2). The Cp-NanI catalytic domain with bound diplacone was superimposed with the crystal structure of human Neu2 with bound 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and models of human Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4 that were constructed using Neu2 as a template. The geranyl group of diplacone is essential for inhibition of the bacterial enzyme as it occupies a hydrophobic pocket containing Phe353, Thr487 and Tyr587. In human Neu proteins the corresponding residues are polar and would not interact favourably with the geranyl group (Fig. 4 \u25b6\nb). Consequently, the structural comparison between the human sialidases Neu1\u2013Neu4 and the Cp-NanI\u2013diplacone complex suggests that the interaction between human sialidases and diplacone is likely to be unfavourable owing to polar or ionic repulsion.",

To overcome drug resistance, various natural flavonoid compounds containing a flavanone backbone with inhibitory effects on viral neuraminidases (Grienke et al., 2012 \u25b6) may be useful. Because diplacone has a flavanone backbone, structural information on the Cp-NanI\u2013diplacone complex would help in the discovery of viral neuraminidase inhibitors. In this light, we compared the structure of the Cp-NanICD\u2013diplacone complex with two structures of drug-resistant mutants of viral neuraminidases (the I223R mutant of H1N1 and the H274Y mutant of H5N1) to examine the use of diplacone against influenza viral neuraminidases. Despite the low sequence identity and low homology of viral neuraminidases from influenza A (IA-NA) and B (IB-NA) with Cp-NanICD (identity: IA-NA, 11.56%; IB-NA, 12.55%; homology: IA-NA, 29.15%; IB-NA, 29.53%), their overall structures are well conserved (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S7a). Moreover, diplacone seems to be accessible regardless of the I223R or the H275Y mutation. The hydroxyl group at the C4 position of diplacone is able to interact with Glu276 of the H275Y mutant as in the wild type, which suggests that diplacone may be a potential lead compound for the development of inhibitors of drug-resistant mutants of viral neuraminidases (Supplementary Fig. S7b).",

            "text": "In summary, we isolated the geranylated flavonoids diplacone, mimulone and 4\u2032-O-methyldiplacone from P. tomentosa and showed their inhibitory activities against Cp-NanI using comparative activity screening. The first crystal structure of sialidase with a geranylated flavonoid provides structural insights into the binding mode of natural flavonoid-based inhibitors at atomic resolution. The higher inhibitory potency of diplacone relative to the other compounds studied here can be ascribed to two principal factors. Firstly, the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group stabilizes the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex through hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Ala292. Secondly, additional hydrophobic interactions are observed between the geranyl group and the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe353, Trp354 and Tyr587 in the active site. Importantly, in the four variants of human sialidase this pocket has a significantly different polarity and would not be expected to interact favorably with the geranyl group. Glu111, Tyr179 and Tyr181 of human Neu2 are not conserved in bacterial and viral sialidases and are considered as important sites for the design of selective drugs targeting bacteria and viruses (Burmeister et al., 1993 \u25b6). However, our biochemical and structural data suggest that the hydrophobic binding pocket of Cp-NanI which binds the geranyl group within diplacone may also be exploited as a means to derive selectivity for bacterial versus human sialidases. Our results will provide valuable information for the design of new selective antibacterial or antiviral agents using flavonoids.",
