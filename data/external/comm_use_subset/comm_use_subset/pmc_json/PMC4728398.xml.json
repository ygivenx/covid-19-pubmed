The clinical characteristics underlying the conditions and outcomes of these individuals are described in Tables S1 and S2. All 34 patients were confirmed to carry solely the RSV viral genomic fragment using PCR analysis. Concomitantly, plasma levels of Ang II were significantly elevated in RSV-infected patients relative to healthy subjects (p < 0.05; Fig. 1a). To determine any correlation between plasma levels of Ang II and the onset of RSV infection, we collected plasma samples from these individuals at early- and late-stages of infection. Plasma levels of Ang II were higher in the early-stage (up until 8 days from onset) than in the late-stage (after 10 days from onset), indicating that plasma levels of Ang II decreased rapidly from the infection to the recovery phase of RSV infection (Figure S1a). Taken together, our data indicate that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the host response against RSV infection.",

Three days after viral infection, plasma levels of Ang II were measured. RSV A2 viral infection resulted in a significant increase in Ang II levels relative to mock infection (p < 0.05; Fig. 1b). Interestingly, RSV BJ016 infection led to a greater increase in Ang II levels than did infection with A2 virus (p < 0.01; Fig. 1b). Concomitantly, Ang II levels in lung homogenates were moderately elevated in mice infected with RSV BJ016 (p < 0.05) or A2 virus relative to mock infection (Fig. 1c). To determine the mechanism responsible for the increased levels of Ang II, we examined the protein levels of ACE2, which converts Ang II to Ang 1\u20137. Accumulation of ACE2 protein was reduced in mice infected with RSV BJ016 or A2 virus, relative to mock infection (Fig. 1d). Importantly, ACE2 protein levels were dramatically decreased in lung homogenates from mice infected with RSV BJ016 virus at 3 days post-infection (p < 0.01; Fig. 1d). Interestingly, levels of ACE protein were comparable in the lungs of mice infected with RSV or mock virus (Fig. 1d). These data demonstrate that RSV infection leads to a decrease in ACE2 expression and an increase in Ang II levels in preclinical models, further supporting the critical role of RAS in RSV infection.",

            "text": "To investigate the impact of ACE2 on live RSV-induced clinical signs associated with lung injury, we infected ACE2 knockout (ACE2 KO) or wild-type (WT) mice with RSV BJ016 virus, and measured overall survival. Fourteen days post infection, 100% of WT mice survived, whereas only 40% of ACE2 KO mice survived (Fig. 2a). Seven days post RSV infection, the average body weight of ACE2 KO mice decreased by 77% relative to that of WT mice (p < 0.01; Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, the lung histopathology scores, as defined by leukocyte infiltration cell counts, were significantly reduced in ACE2 KO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2c). Moreover, lung edema, defined by the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, was significantly greater in RSV-infected ACE2 KO mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01; Fig. 2d), indicating a more severe lung injury phenotype. Consistent with these findings, viral titers in lung tissue of RSV-infected ACE2 KO mice were significantly higher by approximately five-fold relative to those of RSV-infected WT mice (p < 0.01; Fig. 2e). Furthermore, plasma levels of Ang II were significantly elevated in ACE2 KO mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.05) at 3 days post BJ016 infection (Fig. 2f). Similar findings were observed in ACE2 KO and WT mice infected with RSV A2 virus. In an independent experiment, 100% of WT mice were alive at 14 DPI, whereas only 60% of ACE2 KO mice survived (Figure S2a). Concomitantly, body weight decreased in ACE2 KO mice compared with WT mice at 7 DPI (Figure S2b). The lung wet-to-dry weight ratio was significantly higher in RSV A2-infected ACE2 KO mice than in RSV A2-infected WT mice (p < 0.01; Figure S2c). Viral titers of RSV A2 virus-infected KO mice were also significantly higher by nearly five-fold compared with WT mice (p < 0.01; Figure S2d). Collectively, these results suggest that ACE2 plays a critical role in RSV-induced lung injury. Thus, interfering with ACE2 expression may attenuate disease severity following respiratory RSV infection.",

At 8 DPI, a significant increase in body weight was observed -n hACE2-treated mice and vehicle-treated mice (P < 0.01; Fig. 3a). Importantly, hACE2-treated mice exhibited only mild inflammatory reactions, whereas severe histopathological damage, including fragmentation of alveolar walls and infiltration of lymphocytes, was observed in vehicle-treated mice. Concomitantly, leukocyte cell counts were significantly decreased in hACE2-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.01; Fig. 3b). Moreover, the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio in hACE2-treated mice was significantly reduced (p < 0.01; Fig. 3c), indicating an attenuation of lung edema mediated by recombinant ACE2 proteins. Additionally, the lung viral titers of hACE2-treated mice were significantly decreased by nearly 30% compared with vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.01; Fig. 3d). Furthermore, plasma levels of Ang II were significantly decreased in hACE2-treated mice (p < 0.01) at 5 DPI (Fig. 3e). Notably, hACE2-treated mice infected with RSV A2 exhibited mild pathological lung alterations (Figure S2a). The lung wet-to-dry weight ratio in hACE2-treated mice was decreased by 10% compared with vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.01; Figure S2b). Viral titers of hACE2-treated mice infected with RSV A2 were also significantly decreased by 30% compared with vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.01; Figure S3c). These data therefore demonstrate the therapeutic effects of recombinant hACE2 protein in improving lung physiology and histopathology in vivo, and support the potential use of hACE2 protein to alleviate the symptoms of acute lung injury during RSV infection.",

First, live RSV-infected WT mice that received the vehicle treatment exhibited lung edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig. 4a). The AT1R inhibitor (Losartan) treatment markedly attenuated the severity of RSV-induced histopathologic alterations in RSV-infected mice (Fig. 4a). Next, the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio was significantly reduced, by 6% (p < 0.05), in AT1R inhibitor-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4b). Moreover, lung viral titers decreased markedly in the RSV BJ016 virus-infected WT mice treated with AT1R inhibitor (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, plasma levels of Ang II were also reduced by treatment with the AT1R inhibitor (Fig. 4d). On the contrary, the AT2R inhibitor had no significant effects on the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (Figure S4a) or viral titers (Figure S4b), suggesting a lack of efficacy of this inhibitor in rescuing the lung injury induced by BJ016 virus-infected WT mice. Therefore, these data support the assertion that both Ang II and AT1R play critical roles in regulating RSV-induced ALI in preclinical models.",

At 5 DPI, AT1R-treated ACE2 KO mice exhibited mild inflammatory changes, whereas severe histopathological damage was observed in vehicle-treated ACE2 KO mice.

Moreover, lung viral titers were decreased significantly in AT1R-treated ACE2 KO mice compared with vehicle-treated ACE2 KO mice (Fig. 5c). Of note, there was no apparent effect on lung edema (Figure S5a) or viral titers (Figure S5b) in BJ016 virus-infected ACE2 KO mice treated with the AT2R inhibitor, indicating that AT2R was likely not to be involved in the process of RSV-induced lung injury. Based on the above data, we propose that ACE2 may play a crucial role in the process of RSV viral infection, mainly by affecting AT1R (Fig. 5d). Our data suggest that RSV infection causes severe lung injury in an experimental mouse model and in patients, at least in part by modulating the RAS system via down-regulation of the ACE2-AT1R axis.",

However, this historical strain induces mild lung pathology in mice compared to other recently isolated strains27. Therefore, we attempted to isolate pathogenic viruses from clinical nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pediatric patients, and subsequently identified BJ016. BJ016 virus is an isolated RSV belonging to subgroup A, and causes severe respiratory disease in preclinical models.

Moreover, as ACE2 is a non-specific protease, it would also be interesting to investigate its role in the regulation of cellular metabolites14. However, ACE2 is non-functional during lung injury processes induced by various influenza virus subtypes such as H1N1 and H3N2 (data not shown). There are associations between influenza virus infection and ACE2 levels, even with different influenza strains (avian high-path H5N1 versus H7N9)1215.

Nevertheless, a considerably larger cohort of RSV-infected individuals from various regions of China is required to confirm these findings. Live RSV-induced lung injury resulted in significant down-regulation of ACE2 at the early stage after the onset of infection, which controlled the function of RAS, but not in the UV-BJ016 group (Figure S6). We hypothesize that RSV growth is directly or indirectly related to RSV-induced pathology. Moreover, our studies provide a molecular basis for the mechanism of lung injury in patients infected with RSV. Importantly, the levels of Ang II were elevated following down-regulation of ACE2, causing severe lung injury via AT1R during the process of RSV infection (Fig. 5d). Our discovery reveals that common molecular and cellular mechanisms are likely shared by animal models and patients with acid-aspiration10, sepsis29, SARS-CoV11, influenza virus1215 or RSV infection.",

Nevertheless, further studies assessing the potential therapeutic efficacy of recombinant human ACE2 protein are required using different animal models to verify the protective effects of ACE2 against RSV-induced lung injury. Other studies have used cotton rats and monkeys to study RSV pathogenesis and RSV vaccine or drug investigations30. The combination of clinical findings and preclinical studies has revealed a critical role of RAS in the pathogenesis of RSV-induced lung injury, and demonstrated that ACE2 plays a key role in the development and progression of RSV infection. Collectively, our findings suggest the intriguing possibility that targeting ACE2 and RAS represents a valuable strategy for treating RSV infections.",

Mechanisms leading to decreased expression/activity of ACE2 have not been fully investigated. In our initial clinical study, we found that elevated plasma concentrations of Ang II correlated with the severity of lung injury. We therefore hypothesize that levels of Ang II in plasma samples of patients with RSV infection may reflect events in the lower respiratory tract. Although our study was performed in a relatively small cohort of RSV-infected subjects, it included a balanced representation of the spectrum of disease that is caused by this pathogen in infancy. Importantly, our preclinical studies suggest that infections caused by other viral respiratory pathogens that are known to cause lung disease in infants may also result in similar inhibition of ACE2 expression. Further clinical studies will be required to clarify this issue. In this regard, we are currently enrolling infants in a prospective study to test patients with a broad spectrum of disease severity caused by RSV. Based on our findings in this study, we suggest that modulation of ACE2 expression and/or blocking lung injury response may represent potential pharmacological approaches to alleviate RSV-induced lung disease.",
