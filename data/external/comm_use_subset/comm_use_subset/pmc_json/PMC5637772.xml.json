There is also evidence of sporadic background activity of ILI transmission throughout the year amongst communities in tropical climates, with a slight increase in cases during the rainy season.3,4,5 However, little is known about the aetiologic agents of ILI in some developing countries, making it a challenge to plan and implement effective patient management and disease prevention and control efforts.6,7",

This information is important for differential diagnosis, outbreak investigations, trend analysis, early recognition of emerging and re-emerging viruses and implementation of specific public health interventions such as mass vaccination campaigns. In Uganda, a tropical country lying along the equator, surveillance for influenza was started in July 2007. By June 2008, influenza viruses were confirmed in only 12% of patients presenting with ILI at health facilities, implying that the aetiologies in the remaining 88% were unknown.8 There are a few studies in Uganda that have identified influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, parainfluenza viruses, coxsackieviruses and echoviruses as being causative agents of ILI \u2013 but these studies were conducted during the 1970s.9,10,11 More recent results from other countries including Senegal, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya and Madagascar have shown that these viruses are in circulation together with newly-discovered viruses such as coronaviruses, bocaviruses and polyomaviruses.12,13,14,15,16 In the current study, we identify the respiratory viruses that are associated with ILI patients seeking healthcare in Kampala city and Entebbe town, both located in the central region of Uganda.",

This kit has been used elsewhere to identify respiratory viruses in similar specimens.20,21 The assay was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, total nucleic acids (both ribonucleic acid [RNA] and deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]) were extracted from the collected specimens (Viral Gene-SpinTM, iNtRON Biotechnology, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) and target sequences present in the extracts were then reverse transcribed (for the RNA form) and amplified in two separate assays of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR; mPCR) using virus-specific kit primers. One assay contained primers for adenovirus (amplicon size 534 bp), human metapneumovirus (469 bp), coronavirus 229E (375 bp), parainfluenza virus 1 (324 bp), parainfluenza virus 2 (264 bp), and parainfluenza virus 3 (219 bp), whilst the other mPCR assay had primer sets for influenza A virus (513 bp), influenza B virus (455 bp), respiratory syncytial virus B (391 bp), rhinovirus A (337 bp), respiratory syncytial virus A (273 bp) and coronavirus OC43 (231 bp). The amplified products were observed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Specimens that had matching bands corresponding to the expected amplicon sizes for each type of virus relative to the molecular weight marker (Seeplex\u00ae) were scored as positive for that virus. Kit positive and negative controls were also included in every assay run. An internal positive control (Seeplex\u00ae) was also included to evaluate the amplification efficiency of each tested specimen.",

It is probable that an outbreak associated with this virus was ongoing during the study period as observed previously.4,5,6 Conversely, rhinovirus A was detected at 7.9% which is lower than the 10 % \u2013 25% prevalence levels found in other ILI surveillance studies within sub-Saharan tropics.13,14,16,28 In the same studies, the prevalence of respiratory syncytial viruses A and B ranged between 5% \u2013 21% which is higher than our 3.3% total prevalence for the same viruses. The low prevalence levels observed for these viruses could also be associated with their seasonality in the study population \u2013 a variable that could not be established with our current cross-sectional data. Also, our ILI case definition was focused more on influenza surveillance and could have been restrictive with regard to the signs and symptoms of other ILI aetiologies.29,30",
