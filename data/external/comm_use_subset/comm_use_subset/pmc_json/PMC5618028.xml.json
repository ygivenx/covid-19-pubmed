            "text": "Dengue fever is caused by infection of dengue viruses (DENVs), leading to a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms including asymptomatic or undifferentiated febrile illness and sometimes severe forms of symptoms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1]. The virus is naturally transmitted between humans by Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti [2], meaning that it is able to grow in both arthropod and human/mammalian cells. DENVs and other flaviviruses are dependent on the host endoplasm reticulum (ER) for translation, replication and packaging of their genome [3]. It results in inducing the unfolded protein response (UPR) because of the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER [4]. The UPR is composed of three different classes of ER stress transducers, i.e., inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) and protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathways [5]. All of these consist of a luminal domain and a cytosolic domain; the luminal domain recognizes unfolded/misfolded proteins inside the ER, while the cytosolic domain relays signals to turn on downstream genes [5]. DENV infection in mammalian cells mostly leads to death, necrosis and/or apoptosis, due to the persistence of the UPR [6,7]; which has also been observed in mosquito cells [8].",

Such translational control by the virus may help cells subvert ER stress [10]. The PERK signal pathway may be an important factor as it is usually activated and subsequently phosphorylates the downstream effector, \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), which functions to suppress general protein translation [4,11]. Modulation of the UPR in DENV-infected cells was found to override the shutting down of translation, delay cell death and prolong the viral life cycle [12]. The UPR was also identified in mosquito cells with DENV2 infection [8]. However, it usually does not impair the growth of those cells [13], frequently leading to persistent infection in mosquito cells [14,15]. Regulation of the UPR via virus-controlled translation of cellular proteins could be critical for a cell\u2019s fate during infection in both mammalian and mosquito cells.",

            "text": "Protein translation initiation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in cells is generally implemented by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, which is composed of the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, the RNA helicase, eIF4A, the adaptor protein, eIF4G and other essential proteins [16]. The complex functions to link 7-methylGpppG caps at the 5\u2032-end and poly-A tails at the 3\u2032-end [17]. This machinery requires the binding of eIF4E to the cap structure during initiation of mRNA translation. Therefore, this process is called cap-dependent translation and is implemented by most proteins translated for physiological purposes [18]. Cap-dependent translation is initiated by activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (TOR; mTOR) that phosphorylates eIF4E-BP in response to extracellular stimuli in such viral infections [19]. For instance, inhibiting cap-dependent translation may thus shut down protein translation of cells infected by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [20,21]. Based on our previous reports about mosquito cell responses to DENV2 infection [8,22], we herein aimed to demonstrate and discuss how DENV2 regulates protein translation and subsequent cell survival via the PERK signaling pathway in mosquito cells. Hypothetically, the result could be applied to elucidate how the mosquito vector can healthily transmit the DENV and maybe other arboviruses to the host.",

The result showed that eIF4E-BP was phosphorylated at a very early stage of infection by DENV2 (<12 hpi); however, it was at a lower level in a later stage of infection (>36 hpi). In spite of this, such changes may depend on the expressed protein according to the ratios between the phosphorylated form and the amount of eIF4E-BP (Figure 3). Another of TOR\u2019s downstream genes S6K was also shown to be phosphorylated, as shown in mammalian cells infected by West Nile virus [25], particularly in a later stage of infection, e.g., 30 hpi in C6/36 cells, although its protein expression level remained at a constant level throughout the same period of infection (Figure 3). Results revealed that the TOR signaling pathway may have retained its activity involved in controlling cap-dependent protein translation in C6/36 cells infected by the DENV2. This suggests that most cellular proteins are synthesized principally via cap-dependent translation in C6/36 cells. Since NS3 viral proteins were persistently expressed throughout the period of infection for 48 h in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells (Figure 3), viral proteins may be translated by an alternate mode of translation disregarding the TOR signaling pathway [26].",

Though off-target-effects have ever been of concern, this drug seems to be specific enough for observation on its functional trend of PERK inhibition [27,28]. The result showed that inhibition of total protein translation was recovered (Figure 4A). Statistically, it returned to a level close to normal, showing an insignificant difference between PERKi-treated cells with and without infected by DENV2 (Student\u2019s t-test; p > 0.05) (Figure 4B). Dengue viral proteins, capsid (C) and NS3, remained to be synthesized in PERK inhibitor-treated C6/36 cells even those that have been infected by DENV2 for 48 h (Figure 4C). No significant difference of protein amounts was shown between cells with and without PERK inhibitor treatment (Figure 4D). Meanwhile, no significant difference of viral RNA level was shown between cells with and without PERK inhibitor treatment (Figure 4E). In addition, no obvious morphological defects were observed in cells treated with the inhibitor for up to 48 h (Figure 4F), indicating that at 5 \u03bcM, the PERK inhibitor did not have adverse effects on cells. Moreover, reduced protein translation in cells treated with tunicamycin (Tm) was recovered by adding the PERK inhibitor at 5 \u03bcM (Figure 4G). In the meantime, phosphorylated (p-) eIF2\u03b1 was shown to increase after treatment with Tm, but returned to be a lower level of amount when the PERK inhibitor was added (Figure 4G). The eIF2\u03b1 is known to be a key downstream target of the PERK signaling pathway and involved in protein translation in eukaryotic cells [29]. This suggested that the PERK signaling pathway is involved in regulating cellular protein translation when ER stress is induced by DENV2 in mosquito cells.",

Results revealed a difference in the induction of the MMP between cells in the two groups, particularly at 48 hpi. Quantitatively, the fluorescent intensity of DENV2-infected C6/36 cells treated with the PERK inhibitor at 48 hpi (2.32-fold) significantly increased compared to the two control groups (by 1.2-fold compared to untreated cells and 1.36-fold compared to DMSO-treated cells) (Student\u2019s t-test; *** p < 0.001), while no statistical difference was shown at 24 hpi (Figure 5).

When DENV2-infected cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI, slight apoptosis-related cell death was found to have occurred at 24 hpi (Figure 7B), but it had significantly increased by 48 hpi (Figure 7C). There was a statistically-significant difference between cells treated with the PERK inhibitor followed by DENV2 infection compared to the other two control groups with infection (Student\u2019s t-test; *** p < 0.001) (Figure 7D). Activation of caspases-9 (the initiator) and -3 (the effector), which leads to apoptosis, was previously demonstrated in C6/36 cells with DENV2 infection [22]. In this study, we further assessed its occurrence in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells with DENV2 infection. Results showed that no evident change in caspase-9 had occurred in cells by 24 hpi, even when they had been treated with the PERK inhibitor, while it had obviously increased at 48 pi (a 2.52-fold increase) compared to the two control groups (1.20-fold for untreated and 1.18-fold for DMSO-treated cells) (Student\u2019s t-test; *** p < 0.001) (Figure 8A).

Since that are no available tools for directly detecting PERK activation of insect cells in hand, measuring phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was used as the alternative way showing PERK activation in this study. When observing its activity, an increased degree of phosphorylation in response to viral infection was detected, while its protein amount remained stable. Importantly, phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 was significantly reduced when the PERK inhibitor was applied to infected cells (Figure 9A). This indicates that phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 triggered by DENV2 infection is deeply involved in the translation of cellular proteins through the PERK signaling pathway in C6/36 cells. Quantitatively, the level of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 significantly increased (Student\u2019s t-test; ** p < 0.01) in DENV2-infected cells without PERK inhibitor treatment and in those treated with DMSO only. In contrast, no evident change was shown in virus-infected cells treated with a PERK inhibitor (Student\u2019s t-test; p > 0.05) (Figure 9B). In the meantime, synthesis of the NS3 viral protein did not show evident change even in the cells that were infected for 24 h.

A similar reaction was also observed in mammalian cells infected with lytic RNA and DNA viruses [32,33]. This suggests that arboviral infections in host cells, either mammal or mosquito derived, change the translation of cellular proteins [34]. Within cells, proteins are generally synthesized using mRNA as a template; this has been highly conserved across species of eukaryotes throughout evolution [35]. It usually follows a cap-dependent translation mode [18]; which is generally regulated by activated mTOR, which contributes to the phosphorylation and activation of eIF4E-BP and the ribosomal protein, S6 kinase (S6K) [36]. A TOR-mediated pathway may have been involved in such cap-dependent translation, which may be inhibited when dephosphorylated eIF4E-BP binds to eIF4E and thus prevents the formation of the eIF4F complex [24]. This is compatible with our observations in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells, indicating that global cellular proteins are translated by a cap-dependent translation mode [37]. Normally, they are processed by the 40S ribosomal subunit that binds in the vicinity of the cap structure at the 5\u2032-end of mRNA and scans until an AUG codon in the mRNA is encountered [18,38].",

            "text": "The UPR as mentioned above is caused by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER; which actually resulted in changes in X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and splicing activity [41]. The UPR generally leads to activation of three signaling pathways including PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 [5,42]. Apparently, the PERK signaling pathway is highly involved in modulating the dynamic translation of cellular proteins and subsequently regulating ER stress induced by DENV2 infection. Interestingly, decreased translation of global cellular proteins in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells significantly recovered once a PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414) was applied to cells. This indicates that the PERK signaling pathway was activated in response to DENV2 infection, leading to suppressed translation of mosquito proteins. In the meantime, PERK inhibition in this study was further shown to increase MMP changes and ROS accumulation, indicating that DENV2-induced ER stress may be reduced by activating the PERK signal pathway since such cellular responses were not evidently shown in uninfected PERKi-treated cells (Figures S1\u2013S3). It is known that GSK2606414 is a small molecule that inhibits PERK phosphorylation [27]. Thus, it may reduce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [29], resulting in enhanced efficiency of protein translation and the increase of ER stress levels in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. In addition to ER stress, initiator and effector caspases and the apoptosis rate also obviously increased in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells after the PERK signal pathway was inhibited. This revealed that DENV2-induced ER stress in mosquito cells can be alleviated via the shutdown of cellular proteins by eIF2\u03b1, which was phosphorylated by the PERK signal pathway. Undoubtedly, this pro-survival \u201cbyproduct\u201d of mosquito cells was also advantageous for viral replication. Indeed, a similar feature was also observed infected by DENV [43].",

Hypothetically, viral RNAs retain their translation efficiency by utilizing ribosomes released from host mRNAs [9]. This feature ensures maximal viral replication and the possibility of evading a host\u2019s defenses [12,45]. However, it raises an interesting question of how the virus translates its proteins for continuous replication. Although DENVs possess an m7GpppN cap structure at the 5\u2032-end of genomic RNA, they lack a poly A-tail at the 3\u2032-end [46]. As a result, DENVs may utilize a unique mode for protein translation, likely a cap-independent process [26,47]. Cyclization between conserved complementary sequences in both terminal regions of RNA was reported to be the way that proteins are translated in DENVs [48].",

As global proteins of infected cells are usually shut down after infection by DENV2, pro-survival genes may be selectively upregulated. This suggests that there might be second machinery in addition to the mode of cap-dependent translation. Many genes involved in antioxidant defense actually possess internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-containing mRNAs, which may be utilized for an alternative mode of protein translation [37,49]. The ER-stress marker, BiP/GRP78, is known to be the first cellular mRNA with a mode of translation by an IRES element in its 5\u2032-UTR [50]. BiP/GRP78 is significantly upregulated in response to DENV2 infection in C6/36 cells [8]; this is eventually beneficial for cell survival under stress induced by virus infection [51]. As no change in translation of this gene was seen in cells treated with the PERK inhibitor [52], we presumed that this gene may shift its translation from a cap-dependent to a cap-independent mode. Apparently, translation of only mRNAs with the structure for canonical cap-dependent protein translation was reduced in mosquito cells with DENV2 infection.",

One of TOR\u2019s downstream genes, S6 kinase (S6K), was usually phosphorylated particularly at 18 hpi in C6/36 cells, even though its protein level remained at a constant level throughout the same period of infection. In the meantime, NS3 viral proteins were persistently expressed throughout the 48-h infection period. The level of actin was included to prove equal loading of protein in each line. This reveals that the TOR signaling pathway may have been activated and involved in controlling cap-dependent translation of cellular proteins.",

The phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 elicited by treatment with Tm turned out to be a lower level of amount according to the Western blotting analysis.
