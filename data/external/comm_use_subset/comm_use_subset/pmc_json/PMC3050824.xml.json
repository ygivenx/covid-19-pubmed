            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen that belongs to the Betaherpesviridae. The virulence of this pathogen is directly linked to the immune status of its host. Primary HCMV infection is generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, although it causes a mononucleosis-like syndrome in some. After primary HCMV infection, the virus establishes lifelong latency and periodically reactivates with notable pathological consequences. In contrast, HCMV infection in immunocompromised patients such as AIDS patients and solid organ and allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients causes serious disease [1]. Primary infection of women during or right before pregnancy with HCMV is the most common cause of congenital viral infection leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Congenital HCMV infection is also associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and pre-eclampsia. The risk of primary infection in a seronegative mother is 1 to 4%, which carries a 30 to 40% risk of congenital infection [2,3]. The majority of congenitally infected babies are asymptomatic at birth; however, 10 to 17% subsequently develop hearing defects or neurodevelopmental sequelae [4]. Although the most serious clinical sequelae are seen in cases where a mother acquires a primary infection during pregnancy, downstream side effects are also seen in cases where latent HCMV is reactivated [5] and where a mother is reinfected with a different strain of the virus [6].",

            "text": "HCMV has a double-stranded DNA genome of 235 kb encoding approximately 165 genes [7]. It has a very broad cellular tropism resulting in potential infection of nearly every organ system. The ability of HCMV to enter a wide range of cell types involves a complex interaction between several viral envelope glycoproteins and host cell surface receptors, although the entry of herpesviruses into host cells is still poorly understood. The HCMV virion envelope contains at least 20 virus-encoded glycoproteins that are involved in cell attachment and penetration [8]. Of these, glycoprotein B (gB) is the most abundant glycoprotein [9] and is highly conserved among the Herpesviridae [10]. Glycoprotein B plays a critical role in the HCMV entry process. Initially, gB along with gM/gN, is involved in tethering of virions to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the surface of host cells. The short interaction of HCMV with HSPG is followed by more stable interactions with one or more viral cellular receptors, namely epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [11], platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) [12], and toll-like receptor TLR-2 [13]. Glycoprotein B also interacts with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, a coreceptor that enhances HCMV entry [14]. Integrins are known to synergise with EGFR as well as with other receptors to activate signal transduction pathways [15-17]. To complete the entry process, both viral and cellular membranes fuse, allowing the release of virion-associated tegument and capsid proteins into the cytoplasm. This final step of viral entry into host cells requires gB and the gH/gL complex [18-21].",

Recently, Isaacson and coworkers used genetic complementation to confirm that gB is required for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, virus entry, and cell-to-cell spread of HCMV [23]. The importance of gB for viral infection suggests that this viral envelope protein may be a rational target for novel drug design.",

HCMV is transmitted through direct exposure to infected bodily secretions, including saliva, urine and breast milk. Following infection, HCMV enters the bloodstream and spreads to various organs including kidney, liver, spleen, heart, brain, retina, esophagus, inner ear, lungs, colon, and salivary glands [24]. The ability of HCMV to infect a wide variety of cell types is not due to the presence of high plasma levels of extracellular virus, but is primarily due to cell-to-cell transmission between mononuclear phagocytes (possibly macrophages or dendritic cell precursors) and uninfected tissues [25].",

Current treatments for HCMV disease target viral replication and can fail due to the emergence of drug-resistant virus variants and induction of adverse effects. Hence, a new approach in drug design against HCMV is required [26,27]. Since HCMV and other herpesviruses establish a lifelong latency in humans, antiviral therapy that inhibits viral entry may serve as an alternative to the already existing and inadequate therapeutic agents. Here, we report the design, development and characterization of peptides that specifically inhibit viral infection and/or entry as a novel approach to prevent HCMV infection.",

Because gB is the most highly conserved envelope protein amongst the mammalian and avian herpesvirues [25,33], gB of HCMV is likely to be a class III VFP and shares structural features with gB of other members of the Herpesviridae. Class III viral fusion proteins share certain characteristics found in class I or class II viral fusion proteins. The class III viral fusion proteins contain an extended \u03b1-helix that trimerizes in the post-fusion forms of the proteins [28,30,34], as has been well-documented for the post-fusion forms of the class I viral fusion proteins of orthomyxoviruses, retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses [32]. Similarly, the class II viral fusion proteins of flaviviruses and alphaviruses contain a fusion domain comprised principally of \u03b2-sheets and \"fusion loops.\" Class III viral fusion proteins also possess a fusion domain, as well as several other features of class II viral fusion proteins, suggesting that these two classes of proteins may share a common progenitor [31].",

In addition to similarities in the overall structure of the post-fusion forms of class III VFP, there are additional similarities in the distribution of WWIHS-positive sequences (Figure 1, red). The similarities include at least one extended \"fusion loop\" in the fusion domain (domain II), and one or more WWIHS score-positive sequences in domain III. With the exception of the ACNPV GP64, each of these proteins contains another WWIHS positive domain II sequence near the \"hinge\" region adjacent to the domain.

For example, Enfurvitide (Fuzeon) is a 36-amino acid peptide that overlaps with a WWIHS score-positive sequence in the transmembrane protein (TM) of HIV-1, and prevents viral fusion and entry of the virus. To identify regions of HCMV gB that have a high propensity to interact with the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and which potentially may serve as HCMV entry inhibitors, we employed Membrane Protein eXplorer version 3.0 (http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/mpex), a computer program based on the WWIHS. Nine sequences with significant positive WWIHS scores were identified (Figure 2). As expected, several of these WWIHS sequences corresponded to the predicted fusion domain of HCMV gB, including the predicted fusion loops. One of the WWIHS score-positive sequences spanned amino acids 146 to 200 (peptide 146-200) that had a \u0394G score of 4.33 kcal/mol. This sequence was split into two smaller peptides: 146-173 and 174-200. A second large segment within the fusion domain of HCMB gB had a \u0394G score of 3.39, and was split, consequently, into smaller peptides: 233-263 and 264-291. An additional peptide, 297-315 corresponding to another fusion domain sequence, was also synthesized, along with an additional 4 peptides corresponding to other WWIHS-positive domains of HCMV gB. To prevent dimer formation, cysteines were replaced with alanines.",

Using this method, we identified several regions of HCMV gB with high interfacial hydrophobicity. Peptides that are analogous to several of these regions inhibited HCMV infectivity at low \u03bcM concentrations (Figure 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). When tested in combination certain combinations of peptides (peptides 264-291 and 297-315) displayed increased inhibition of infectivity at concentrations of 125 nM (Figure 8). These results suggest that the HCMV inhibitory peptides identified here may serve as the basis for potential antiviral therapies. The success of the inhibition of fusion greatly depends, not only on biophysical properties of synthesized peptides and their concentrations, but also on the size and shape of the binding pocket of HCMV gB.

Seven out of 138 15-mer peptides inhibited infection by more than 50% at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM. Three peptides (gB131, gB122 and gB94) with 50% effective concentrations below 20 \u03bcM were studied further. Peptide gB131 (residues 681 to 695 in HSV-1 gB-1) was identified as a specific entry inhibitor (EC50, ~12 \u03bcM). The gB122 peptide (residues 636 to 650 in gB-1) blocked viral entry (EC50, ~18 \u03bcM), protected cells from infection (EC50, ~72 \u03bcM), and inactivated virions in solution (EC50, ~138 \u03bcM). Of the seven inhibitory peptides identified in the Akkarawongsa et al. study, three of them, corresponding to residues 346 to 360 (gB64), 436 to 450 (gB82), and 636 to 650 (gB122), were in regions of HSV-1 gB-1 with positive WWIHS scores. The success of their study affirms our strategy of targeting the WWIHS score-positive sequences as inhibitors of HCMV. Two overlapping peptides spanning the residues 496 to 510 (gB94) and 501 to 515 (gB95) were not in WWIHS score-positive sequence, but the analogous sequence in HCMV is WWIHS score-positive. Additionally, comparisons across viral families could potentiate identification of entry inhibitors. For instance, HSV-1 inhibitory peptide gB131 corresponding to domain IV, also known as a stem, is analogous to the Hrobowski dengue inhibitory peptide for the class II viral fusion proteins [35] (Figure 1).",

HSV-1 inhibitory peptide gB64 (residues 346 to 360) identified by Akkarawongsa et al. corresponds to this region, with HCMV inhibitory peptide 297-315 being the analogous peptide (Figure 10). It is possible that some of the inhibitory peptides identified for HSV-1 could be optimized to work for HCMV and vice versa. The fusion domain of HCMV gB may be the initial site of interaction directly with the lipids of the cell bilayer [31]. The HCMV inhibitory peptides could competitively block these interactions, or trigger downstream fusion events, and conformational changes in gB, prematurely. Inhibitory peptides corresponding to other domains likely do not block lipid interactions. Inhibitory peptides may employ several mechanisms of action, and therefore those that are analogous to domain III could block receptor interactions.",

Any two peptides that work additively to block the fusion of the virion with the host cell membrane must have unique amino acid sequences, biophysical properties and be present at certain concentrations that will allow them to interact with each other, with gB and, possibly, with other glycoproteins that are instrumental in the fusion event. Peptides 174-200 and 233-263 tested together showed only 42% inhibition at the concentration of 50 \u03bcM each (Figure 7), and did not work in an additive fashion.
