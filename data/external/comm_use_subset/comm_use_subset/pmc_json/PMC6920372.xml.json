It requires a fine-tuned sequence of molecular actions largely executed by autophagy-related genes (ATGs). In the initial steps, a phagophore consisting of a double-membrane sheet is nucleated, amplified and finally closed to form a vesicular structure called an autophagosome that engulfs cellular material for degradation1. Degradation is accomplished after the fusion of autophagosomes (AP) with lysosomes to form autolysosomes (AL).",

In general, FKBP51 is a stress-regulated protein involved in numerous pathways, likely through scaffolding regulatory protein interactions3. FKBP51-induced autophagy is accompanied by elevated levels of Beclin1 (BECN1) through a yet unknown mechanism. This multifunctional protein is crucial in autophagy and membrane trafficking processes4. In mammals, BECN1 is an essential component of two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complexes through its interaction with either Barkor (BECN1-associated autophagy-related key regulator)/ATG14 or UVRAG (UV radiation resistance-associated gene)5. The ATG14-complex is important for the initial nucleation steps of autophagy, whereas the UVRAG containing complex functions in endocytic trafficking and autophagosomal maturation. ATG14 is also found on mature autophagosomes where it enhances tethering and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes6.",

The oncogenic kinase AKT1 phosphorylates BECN1 at positions S234, S295, which leads to sequestration of this peripheral membrane binding protein7 to the cytoskeleton with the result of inhibition of autophagy8. Several other autophagy-regulating kinases (both stimulatory and inhibitory) also target BECN14. Furthermore, distinct E3 ligases of different types modify BECN1 with K11-, K48- or K63-linked poly-ubiquitins9, complemented by ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs)10,11. Depending on the site and type of linkage of BECN1 ubiquitination, autophagy is inhibited or enhanced; the underlying mechanisms involve degradation of BECN1 and modulation of its protein interactions9,12.",

Congruently, autophagy-inducing agents can have antiviral effects13. In case of coronaviruses (CoV), the formation of replication complexes at double membrane vesicles (DMV) and, most likely, of infectious particles depend on ER-derived membranes, as does autophagy14\u201316. Thus, current knowledge suggests that CoV interact differentially with components of the autophagic pathway with the potential for both the utilization of autophagy components for virus replication and for the attenuation of autophagy17. Substances inhibiting the generation of DMVs have been shown to be broadly reactive against CoV replication in vitro18. Importantly, this included CoV of different genera including the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, a paradigmatic emerging virus that entails considerable pandemic risks due to its prevalence in dromedary populations in Africa and the Arabian Pensinsula and its transmission via the respiratory tract causing a severe form of pneumonia in humans18\u201321. Since its discovery in 2012, the WHO has reported 2468 human MERS-CoV infections in 27 countries, of which at least 851 were fatal (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/).",

Although pharmacological interventions of broadly active AKT1- and mTOR-pathway inhibitors showed promise for antiviral therapy against several viruses including MERS-CoV22, the identification of downstream molecules may facilitate a more targeted therapeutic approach with putative reduced side effects in patients.",

Of note, also the induction of autophagy by starvation did not significantly change MHV replication26. On the other hand, results of an earlier study employing ATG5 knockout cells suggested that autophagy is required for the formation of DMV-bound MHV replication complexes thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of viral replication16. Furthermore, pharmacological or genetic manipulation of autophagy showed that replication of another CoV, the Transmissible Gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is negatively regulated by autophagy27. In contrast, another study reported enhancement of TGEV replication by autophagy28. Thus, no general role of autophagy in CoV replication could be established yet.",

The type of lysine linkage determines protein fate and function39. Using a set of ubiquitin mutants, we found that SKP2 leads to K48-linked poly-ubiquitination (Fig. 3a), which marks proteins for proteasomal degradation39. Using a freely available mass-spectrometry database that proposes ubiquitination sites in mammalian proteins40, we mutated various lysines in BECN1 and identified K402 in BECN1\u2032s ECD (evolutionary conserved domain) as the attachment site of SKP2-directed ubiquitination (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 1e). The potential recruitment of SKP2 by FKBP51 raises the question how this may lead to reduced rather than increased ubiquitination of BECN1. Since FKBP51 inactivates the kinase AKT1 through complex formation with the phosphatase PHLPP2,31, and AKT1 regulates SKP2 through phosphorylation at S7241, we used ectopic expression of FKBP51-Flag and co-immunoprecipitation to probe for protein interactions and the phosphorylation status of SKP2. The association between FKBP51 and BECN1, AKT1, PHLPP, and SKP2 was accompanied by a decreased phosphorylation of AKT1 at position S473 and of SKP2 at position S72 (Fig. 3c\u2013e).",

            "text": "These results suggest a mechanism where FKBP51 enacts a cascade of activity changes in AKT1 and SKP2 by the recruitment of PHLPP (Fig. 4a). We followed several approaches to substantiate the functionality of this cascade, first by employing SKP2 mutants that either mimic phosphorylation (S72D/S75D) or cannot be phosphorylated (S72A)41. The phosphomimetic mutant still decreased BECN1 stability, but the S72A mutant showed no effect (Fig. 4b, c), consistent with the proposed cascade (Fig. 4a). We further made use of a well-established PHLPP inhibitor42 that led to enhanced phosphorylation of AKT1 and SKP2 (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 1f). A pulse-chase assay showed that the stability of BECN1 decreased by using the PHLPP inhibitor (Fig. 4e, f). This inhibitor had no effect on the stability of the ubiquitination-protected K402R mutant of BECN1, further corroborating the proposed cascade (Fig. 4g, h). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of AKT1 enhanced BECN1 stability in both assays, leaving about twice the amount of BECN1 at 90 min compared to control (Fig. 4i\u2013l). In order to verify that reduced SKP2 activity drives autophagy in our cellular set-up, we used siRNA and determined the degradation of long-lived proteins43. Targeting SKP2 increased proteolysis, but not in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA, Fig. 4m). Furthermore, we observed decreased levels of P62 (Supplementary Fig. 1g), which typically goes along with enhanced autophagy43. All these data are consistent with an inhibitory effect of SKP2 on autophagy regulated by a phosphorylation cascade involving FKBP51, PHLPP and AKT1.",

The pulse-chase assay confirmed SMIP004 as the most efficient compound in stabilising BECN1 leaving threefold more BECN1 protein after 90 min (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, SMIP004 reduced ubiquitination of BECN1 most efficiently (Fig. 5c, last lane). The long-lived protein assay revealed that SMER3 and SMIP004 enhanced protein half-life, while C1 showed no effect (Fig. 5d). Starvation by cultivating the cells in HBSS, which we confirmed to induce autophagy (Supplementary Fig. 2b-d), did not elicit a greater effect than SMIP004 in the long-lived protein assay (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, SMIP004 most profoundly affected not only BECN1, but also LC3B-II/I and P62 (example blot in Fig. 5e, quantifications in Supplementary Fig. 2e-g) that are established markers of autophagy. To analyse autophagy more thoroughly, it is mandatory to include assays that address autophagic protein turn-over, commonly referred to as autophagic flux43. Thus, we subjected SMIP004 to a flux assay with the specific inhibitor of vacuolar H + -ATPases bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which interferes with lysosome acidification and thus degradation of autophagosome cargo43. We revealed a stimulatory effect of SMIP004 on the autophagic flux (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). In addition, it has been shown that ATG14 oligomerizes to dimers and tetramers, which is essential for autophagy by promoting STX17 binding and autophagosome-lysosome fusion6. Using capillary-based electrophoresis allowing for better resolution at high molecular weight we observed ATG14 oligomerization to 7\u20138mers, which was enhanced by SMIP004 (Supplementary Fig. 2h, i). Thus, SMIP004 was used as SKP2-inhibitor (SKP2i) in all subsequent experiments.",

            "text": "Results up to this point suggested that activity of BECN1 and thereby autophagy is limited by SKP2, which in turn is activated by AKT1 (41 and Figs. 3, 4). Since MERS-CoV has been shown to enhance phosphorylation of AKT122, it might reduce autophagy. Infection of VeroB4 cells with MERS-CoV facilitated increased phosphorylation of SKP2 at S72 (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 3a), with a concomitant decrease of cellular levels of BECN1 (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 3b) and enhanced K48-polyubiquitinylation of BECN1 (Fig. 6b). Infection with MERS-CoV further led to an increase of the total number of phagocytic vesicles (sum of AL + AP) per cell (Fig. 6c, d). However, the number of successfully formed AL was reduced significantly indicating that AP can form but not fuse with lysosomes when cells are infected. A fusion block was also evidenced by the significantly reduced ATG14 oligomerization, essential for AP-lysosome fusion6, in infected cells (Fig. 6e, f) and by the increase of the autophagy target P62 (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The block of vesicle fusion was further tested by the use of BafA1: as expected, LC3B-II/I levels were not further enhanced upon treatment with BafA1 (Fig. 6g). The fusion between AP and lysosome membranes is facilitated by the interaction between tSNARE proteins STX17 (AP-bound) and VAMP8 (lysosome-bound). This interaction is mediated by SNAP2947 (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that MERS-CoV infection leads to a reduced interaction of STX17 with SNAP29 and VAMP8 (Fig. 6h). This further supports the conclusion that MERS-CoV infection causes a block of AP-lysosome fusion.",

CoV-induced DMV formation is known to depend on viral nonstructural proteins (NSP) 4 and 618,48,49. Ectopic expression of MERS-CoV NSP4 and 6 indeed led to an accumulation of LC3B-II/I and of P62 in the case of NSP6, while NSP4 only had a very minor effect on LC3B-II/I (Fig. 7c). This suggested a block of the autophagic flux by NSP6, which was confirmed by using BafA1 (Fig. 7d), altogether suggesting the MERS-CoV-induced inhibition of autophagic flux to be mediated mainly by NSP6.",

Protein 4b and 5, but not 3 and 4a, caused accumulation of P62 and enhanced the level of LC3B-II/I similar to Baf1A, which produced an additional effect in the presence of p3 or p4a, but not p4b or p5 (Fig. 7e, f). Because p4b and p5 are accessory proteins that can be deleted without lethal effects on virus replication, we constructed recombinant MERS-CoVs lacking the respective orfs (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) to evaluate their effect on autophagy in the context of full virus replication. In comparison to the recombinant MERS-CoV the p4b- and p5-deletion variants showed a decreased accumulation of P62 and LC3B-II/I, suggesting that both proteins contribute to the inhibition of the autophagic flux (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). The p4b- and p5-deleted viruses as well as the WT control virus grew to higher levels in Atg5 knockout Vero cells compared to WT cells (Supplementary Fig. 4e, f). However, the p4b and p5-deleted viruses showed overall an up to 10-fold decreased replication in both WT and Atg5 knockout cells compared to WT virus suggesting a p4b- and p5-dependent attenuation of virus replication that is independent of ATG5-directed autophagy.",

To explore the relevance of SKP2 inhibition on viral infection in more general terms, we also tested SKP2i in Sindbis virus (SINV) replication. It is known that SINV induces autophagy but that its replication levels are unaffected by it52.

Therefore, we used two recently introduced tools to enhance BECN1 function in autophagy: the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 and a BECN1-derived peptide53,54. These compounds, in contrast to SKP2i, do not change the levels of BECN1, but increase autophagy by redirecting BECN1 function towards the autophagy pathway, which we confirmed in VeroB4 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7b\u2013d, g). Enhanced autophagy was indicated by the increase of LC3B-II/I (Supplementary Fig. 7e, g) and the reduction of P62 (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). This was paralleled by inhibition of MERS-CoV replication by up to 60-fold in the case of the BECN1-peptide (TAT-B) (Figure Supplementary Fig. 7h) and up to 10-fold in the case of ABT-737 at 48h p.i.

The fluorescence-based assay revealed that SKP2i enhanced the number of AP while decreasing the number of AL (Fig. 8b, c). Furthermore, SKP2i enhanced ATG14 oligomerization (Fig. 8d, e) and the interaction of autophagic SNARE complex proteins (STX17 with VAMP8 or SNAP29), in MERS-CoV infected cells (Fig. 8f), thereby counteracting the effect of MERS-CoV (see above, Fig. 6h). Thus, SKP2i inhibits MERS-CoV production, most likely by enhancing BECN1 levels, which might also account for its effect on late steps of autophagy55. Since very little interaction between BECN1 and STX17 was detected using immunoprecipitation, this effect of BECN1 may require interaction with ATG146.",

Thus, FKBP51 impacts BECN1 at least via two mechanisms, phosphorylation of BECN1 itself2 and of its regulatory E3 ligase SKP2.

Although the detailed molecular mechanisms are yet to be analysed, MERS-CoV NSP6 may also play a role in inhibiting the expansion of autophagosomes as shown for other betacoronaviruses48.

The absence of p4b and p5 during MERS-CoV replication may also result in lower LC3B levels compared to MERS-CoV wildtype-infected but also to the mock-infected control cells. This points to a more complex interaction between virus replication and autophagy; p4b and p5 may counteract a response of the host to viral infection, but the functional relevance of their link to autophagy requires further investigation. Apparently, several CoV proteins collaborate to reprogram the membrane traffic in the cell for DMV formation serving as compartments of viral genome replication and transcription18,24.

From the present results, therapeutic induction of autophagy by inhibition of SKP2 emerges as a promising approach. We should note that all the substances tested here have or may have additional targets. While we cannot exclude the possibility that for each of the compounds it is this additional target that is responsible for the antiviral effect, we consider this scenario as less likely; this assessment is also based on the observation of the antiviral effects of compounds targeting BECN1, which we establish here as client of SKP2.

Briefly, in a first step a kanamycin resistance gene was amplified by an overhang extension PCR from the pEP-KanS vector (kindly provided by K. Tischer and K. Osterrieder) with primers containing homologous MERS-CoV recombination sites, the desired mutation and an I-SceI restriction site (MERS-delta4b-ABC-Kana-F: 5\u2032-ATT CGCGCAAAGCGAGGAAGAGGAGCCATTCTCAACTAATGATGTTGTCTCCATACGG TCTTTAGGGATAACAGGGTAATCGATTT-3\u2032 and MERS-delta4b-BCD-Kana-R: 5\u2032-TT GTTTATTACCCTGATTGGAAGACCGTATGGAGACAACATCATTAGTTGGAGAATG GCTCCTGCCAGTGTTACAACCAATTAACC-3\u2032; MERS-delORF5_Kana-F: 5\u2032-TTCTTA TCCCATTTTACATCATCCAGGATTTTAACGAACTGCAGCTCTGCGCTACTATGGTA GGGATAACAGGGTAATCGATTT-3\u2032 and MERS-delORF5_Kana-R: 5\u2032-GATTAGCCTC TACACGGGACCCATAGTAGCGCAGAGCTGCAGTTCGTTAAAATCCTGGATGCCAG TGTTACAACCAATTAACC-3\u2032). We would like to point out that this design preserves the regulatory sites of ORF5, in contrast to a previous approach69. Our rationale was to preserve an equal number of subgenomic mRNAs. E. coli GS1783 cells (kindly provided by K. Tischer and K. Osterrieder) containing the MERS-CoV cDNA clone were transfected with the PCR product in order to induce the recombination of the transfer construct into the MERS-CoV backbone. In a second step, the kanamycin selection marker was excised by an inducible in vivo I-SceI cleavage and the second Red recombination event. Rescue and stock production of the recombinant viruses were performed as described elsewhere85.",

The effect of SKP2 can be diminished in two ways, either by chemical inhibition or by FKBP51, which scaffolds protein interactions ultimately leading to SKP2 inactivation through inhibiting its phosphorylation. Both scenarios enhance autophagy, which involves ATG14 oligomerization (probably 7\u20138mers) as recently described essential step in functional autophagy6. MERS-CoV reduces autophagy through distinct viral proteins leading to blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and ATG14 oligomerization. Compounds inhibiting SKP2 reinstate autophagy and efficiently reduce viral production. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
