            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic virus belonging to the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. This highly pathogenic virus is transmitted to a wide range of vertebrate hosts, primarily livestock and humans, via mosquitoes and other arthropod vectors. Humans may become infected through contact with infected bodily fluids or tissues, mosquito bites, or aerosolization [1]. While symptoms in humans are usually mild and resemble a flu-like illness, a small percentage of patients (~2%) may develop serious disease, which includes retinal lesions, meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, severe hemorrhagic fever, coma and death. In recent years, there has been an increased rate of mortality in humans (>30%) [2,3]. Mortality rates in livestock are more dramatic; as high as 30% in adult livestock and up to 100% in newborns and the young [4].",

However each of these methodologies have their caveats. For example, virus isolation can be both costly and time-consuming. Molecular based assays such as RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using the TaqMan probe technology, and real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays (RT-LAMP) while highly specific and sensitive are time-consuming and require specialized laboratory equipment and trained personal [5]. The nucleoprotein (NP) of RVFV is the most abundant viral protein and is often used in diagnostic testing by ELISA. ELISAs are affordable and generally regarded as specific, but the detection limit is significantly lower than qRT-PCR assays [5]. Furthermore, NP was observed to serologically cross-react during testing of sera obtained from US and Canadian livestock [6]. Thus, there is a need for a sample preparation method that will eliminate highly abundant interfering proteins and concentrate viral antigens. Nanotrap particles are a novel sample preparation technology that can address these issues.",

These hydrogel particles contain a core made of cross-linked polymeric networks that consist of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and co-monomers such as acrylic acid (AAc), allylamine (AA), and N,N\u2032-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS). Nanotrap particles are functionalized with charge-based affinity baits via copolymerization and covalent binding to the shell. The baits serve to further capture, concentrate, and trap targets proteins. The promiscuity of these particles can further be decreased by encapsulating the particles within an outer cross-linked poly(p)-NIPAm shell that may be inert or contain vinyl sulfonic acid (VSA). This shell can be modified for the inclusion or exclusion of high abundant large molecules such as albumin by increasing or decreasing the size of the pores, which are generated by cross-linking [7\u20139].",

Several studies conducted by Luchini et al. demonstrated the capture and enrichment of small molecules spiked in whole blood, serum, and other complex solutions [7,9]. Recent studies have utilized Nanotrap particles in viral and bacterial infections. Nanotrap particles have been used to increase the sensitivity of Lyme disease detection by capturing the antigen shed by Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria responsible for the disease, in urine [10]. Another recent paper published by our group utilized these particles as an important sample preparation tool in RVFV detection, where particles allowed for capture, enrichment, and protection of the RVFV virions spiked in serum samples [11]. A 2014 paper by Jaworski et al. demonstrated that Nanotrap particles can be utilized to capture both HIV-1 virions as well as various viral proteins such as Tat and Nef in clinically relevant matrices [12]. Nanotrap particles have also been shown to enrich for virions of both RNA and DNA viruses that cause respiratory illnesses, including human coronavirus (HCoV), adenovirus, and influenza A [13]. These studies together have demonstrated that Nanotrap particles can improve sensitivity more than 100-fold over existing methods.",

The supernatants were separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes using the overnight wet transfer methodology at 80 mA at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS +0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature. The primary antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA in PBS-T at a 1:1000 dilution for anti-His antibody (Cell Signaling) and at a 1:120 dilution for EC13 and EC22 antibodies (Institute for Infectious Animal Diseases, College Station, TX), and incubated overnight at room temperature. The EC13 and EC22 primary antibodies were reused for several experiments without the addition of extra antibody. The membranes were then washed 3 times with PBS-T and incubated with secondary HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit (for anti-His antibody) or anti-mouse (for EC13 antibody) antibody diluted 1:1,000 in 3% BSA for 2 hours and then washed 4 times with PBS-T for 5 minutes. The western blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit (ThermoScientific) and a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). The band analysis tools (volume box option) of Quantity One 1-D analysis software (Bio-Rad) were used to determine the background-subtracted density of the bands in the western blots. For each sample, the averages of two band densities were taken. Fold enrichment was determined by dividing the (+)NT samples by the (-)NT control samples.",

            "text": "Nucleoprotein (NP) is the most abundant viral protein of RVFV. It has been previously speculated that NP of RVFV and other viruses can be released from host cells in the absence of other proteins. A paper published by Liu et al. demonstrated that a substantial amount of NP could be purified from the media of infected Sf9 cells, suggesting that this protein may be released independently of the other viral proteins [16]. Therefore, RVFV NP can be utilized as an important biomarker in detecting RVFV infections. Our first set of experiments sought to confirm the presence of non-virion associated NP in viral supernatants. Vero cells were infected with RVFV MP12 (MOI 1) and media supernatants collected when 80\u201390% CPE was observed (48 hours post infection). Supernatants were separated using a centrifugal concentrator with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 300 kDa, thus proteins or macromolecular complexes above the MWCO would be retained. Control samples that were not separated with the concentrator were saved and analyzed in parallel. Higher amounts of NP protein were detected in the concentrated supernatant (top portion) as compared to the filtrate (bottom portion), which would contain the NP (size 26 kDa) and its homodimers (Fig 1A and 1C). Due to their size, intact RVFV virions would be retained in the concentrated supernatant (top portion). To examine whether infectious virus could be detected within the filtrate i.e. bottom portion, plaque assay analysis was performed on both samples. Comparable infectious titers for both control and top portion samples were observed (1.3E+07 versus 1.2E+07 pfu/ml, Fig 1B). However, roughly 6E+01 pfu/ml of RVFV was detected for the bottom portion. Most of the NP was clearly found in the concentrated top fraction, which also contained the majority of the virions (Fig 1C). However, a detectable amount of NP (approximately 20%) was still present in the filtrate. Calculating the NP band intensity per pfu (Fig 1D) indicated that the filtrate had a greater amount of non-virion associated NP available for potential capture.",

Our subsequent sets of experiments utilized a simple experimental workflow as depicted graphically in Fig 2. To determine whether Nanotrap particles (NT) were capable of capturing and enriching the RVFV NP, particles with various bait chemistries and architectures were screened (Table 1). Purified recombinant His-NP was incubated with seven different Nanotrap particles. Bound (pellet) and unbound (supernatant) sample material were analyzed by western blot (Fig 3A). Our results demonstrated that all Nanotrap particles were capable, to varying efficiencies, of binding His-NP. While 100% capture was not achieved, there was a decrease in the amount of unbound material (S lanes) as compared to the-NT control samples. We confirmed our findings with purified NP (not His-tagged) to ensure that the particles were binding to the NP of the virus and not to the histidine tag (Fig 3B). We obtained similar results demonstrating that NT45, NT53, and NT69 were the best performers with purified recombinant RVFV NP. To demonstrate the binding capacity of the Nanotrap particles with a large sample volume (one milliliter) and low analyte concentration (1\u03bcg/ml) we tested the top three performers\u2014NT45, NT53, and NT69 (Fig 3C). These results showed that NT45 was the best performer in enrichment of the protein at a higher volume, with a 39.5-fold increase in NP band density compared to the no NT control. Furthermore, NT45 allowed for the enrichment of the protein at a concentration that is undetectable without Nanotrap particle coupling. Finally, we confirmed NP capture in viral supernatants at a volume of one milliliter. NP was only faintly detectable without Nanotrap particles at 1E+06 pfu/ml. However, there was at least a four-fold increase in NP band density with all six Nanotrap particles screened. Once more, NT45 was the best performer for capturing and enriching NP, with a 15-fold increase in band density levels compared to the no NT control (Fig 3D). Collectively, these results demonstrated that the use of NT45 consistently allowed for the greatest detection of NP.",

We incubated the three Nanotrap particles with cytoplasmic extracts (CE) obtained from RVFV MP12-infected Vero cells. Our results demonstrated that all three Nanotrap particles were capable of capturing and concentrating NP from a larger volume of 1 ml (Fig 4A). Based on the results from Fig 3C and Fig 4A, we concluded that NT45 yielded the highest increase in band density (66 fold) compared to the no NT sample. We next performed an experiment with four concentrations of CE (15 \u03bcg/ml, 7.5 \u03bcg/ml, 1.5 \u03bcg/ml, and 0.75 \u03bcg/ml) to establish a limit of detection with and without NT45. While the NP was detectable without Nanotrap particles at 15 \u03bcg/ml and 7.5 \u03bcg/ml, the protein was undetectable at the lower protein concentrations. In contrast, the NT45-incubated samples were able to detect the protein down to the lowest concentration tested (Fig 4B), demonstrating a 21-fold increase in band density as compared to the no NT sample tested at the same concentration.

Furthermore, detection of NP with and without NT45 increased from 8 to 24 hr post-infection (Fig 5B). While still detectable at 8 hours without the addition of Nanotrap particles, there was a near 10-fold increase in NP band density with the addition of NT45. We also compared different sample volumes with the addition of NT45 to demonstrate the enrichment capabilities of the Nanotrap particles (Fig 5C). While the NP was virtually undetectable in the control samples containing no Nanotrap particles, a clear band was detected at 100 \u03bcl of sample with band intensity increasing as the volume of sample increased, with a 12.6-fold increase in band density at the 1 ml sample volume compared to the no NT sample. Lastly, we wanted to determine if we could increase the limit of detection with the Nanotrap particles. We incubated viral supernatants at various viral concentrations from 1E+07 to 1E+04 pfu/ml with NT45 (Fig 5D).

            "text": "We next wanted to mimic a native infection scenario using animal sera (sheep and goat) to demonstrate the enrichment capabilities of the Nanotrap particles in these complex solutions containing various host proteins (such as albumin). NT45, our best performing candidate, is a Nanotrap that contains reactive red 120 and reactive yellow 86 chemical dye baits without a surrounding outer shell. The outer shell serves to further exclude high abundant, high molecular weight analytes that may compete with lower molecular weight proteins. To determine if the inclusion of an outer shell would allow for better enrichment of NP in more complex media (e.g. animal sera), NT104 was created, which is NT45 containing an outer shell. We initially started with 100% sheep serum spiked with cytoplasmic extracts from RVFV infected cells incubated with NT45 and NT104. We hypothesized that the outer shell of NT104 would exclude the high abundant host proteins and increase NP detection. However, we found a striking enrichment of the NP with both NT45 and NT104, whereas the control (no NT) sample was only slightly detectable (Fig 6A). Surprisingly, we found that NT45, not NT104, was the best candidate in serum capture, resulting in a 20-fold increase in band density for NT45 and a 13-fold increase in band density for NT104 compared to the no NT sample. These results suggest that the outer shell of NT104 may interfere with capture of the dimeric form of the NP. We therefore utilized NT45 in the capture of NP in both sheep and goat sera. Similarly NP was greatly enriched in goat serum, with a 6- and 12-fold increase in band density for sheep serum and goat serum, respectively (Fig 6B). Next, we wanted to determine the limit of detection of RVFV in sheep serum. In order to capture all forms of NP (monomeric and dimeric), we incubated a combination of NT45 and NT104 particles with 1 ml samples of sheep serum spiked with RVFV MP12 supernatant at various titers. While NP was not detectable at any viral titers tested without Nanotrap particles, the NP was detectable down to 1E+04 pfu/ml after NT45/104 incubation (Fig 6C). Lastly, we wanted to demonstrate whether a combination of Nanotrap particles would be best for NP enrichment. Previously we have shown that NT53, which contains a cibacron blue bait and an outer shell, was the best Nanotrap particle for capture of RVFV virions, as demonstrated with both plaque assays and qRT PCR [11]. We therefore incubated our sample with equal parts NT45 and NT53 and compared capture to NT45 alone at various viral concentrations. Our results showed that there was not a significant increase in NP detection with the combination of Nanotrap particles (Fig 6D). This result is not entirely unexpected as NT45 was also capable of capturing RVFV virions, albeit at a lower efficiency than NT53 [11]. These results demonstrate that the Nanotrap particles are able to capture and enrich for both virion and non-virion associated NP, allowing for the enhanced detection of NP without interference of other high abundant proteins that are found in clinically relevant matrices.",

Most viral proteins are degraded in the presence of naturally occurring proteases found in sera. Furthermore, exposure to heat increases viral protein degradation. Our next set of experiments aimed to determine if Nanotrap particles were capable of protecting NP from degradation after prolonged storage (up to 120 hours) and at an elevated temperature (37\u00b0C). We examined both NP in cytoplasmic extracts as well as in viral supernatants spiked in sheep or goat sera. We first tested NP stability at ambient temperatures over a long incubation period. The samples incubated with NT45 remained stable from 24 to 120 hours for both cytoplasmic extracts and viral supernatants (Fig 7A and 7C, respectively). In the absence of Nanotrap particles, NP was virtually undetectable at this dilution (as seen in Fig 7E for viral supernatants). We next wanted to demonstrate that the Nanotrap particles can protect NP at elevated temperatures. The Nanotrap particles are temperature-sensitive, decreasing in size with increased temperature [17]. We therefore hypothesized that in the presence of elevated heat, the Nanotrap particles would decrease in size and further restrict NP inside. Once again, NP in the absence of the Nanotrap particles was virtually undetectable starting at 24 hours (as seen in Fig 7E for viral supernatants). In contrast, NP from the NT45 samples was strongly detected at all timepoints from 24 to 120 hours for both sample sets (Fig 7B and 7D). Furthermore, over time there was no NP degradation in the presence of NT45. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Nanotrap particles are capable of protecting NP (and perhaps the virion itself) from degradation during prolonged storage at elevated temperatures.",

The Nanotrap particles can also be used for the capture of intact virions. We previously demonstrated the capture and enrichment of RVFV virions and other viral pathogens with several Nanotrap particles [11]. Importantly, we showed that while the virus can be inactivated with heat or detergent after Nanotrap particle incubation, the nucleic acid of the virus is still detectable with qRT-PCR methodology. We have expanded upon these previous findings and shown here that the Nanotrap particles can be utilized as a sample preparation tool to concentrate NP that is commonly used for RVFV diagnostics.

From our initial Nanotrap particle screening we identified NT45, NT53, and NT69 as our top three candidates, all of which are triazine-derived textile dyes that have commonly been used for protein purification via affinity chromatography [19]. The structure of the dyes mimic the structure of substrates that bind to the active sites of different proteins and therefore are able to bind a wide variety of proteins. Dye affinities are determined by the structure of the dye and how well it can bind to the active site of the proteins in question. NT45 is one core particle that is coupled to two different dyes; it is a mixture of reactive red and reactive yellow dyes, whereas NT53 contains cibacron blue baits. Cibacron blue has been described as a \u201cuniversal pseudoaffinity ligand\u201d that nonspecifically binds analytes through ionic and/or hydrophobic interactions due to its aromatic (nonpolar) and sulfonate (ionic) groups [20]. While the exact mechanism in which the Nanotrap particles bind to the analyte is unknown, we hypothesize that the baits of the three Nanotrap particles are somehow attracted to the hexameric structure of the NP in an ionic manner [20,21]. Specifically, the Nanotrap particles may be binding to the positively charged patch of the NP hexamer that constitutes the RNA binding site [20,21].",

This is due to several factors including both endogenous and exogenous proteases, as well as temperature and pH changes. It is therefore recommended that samples be placed in temperatures of 4\u00b0C or lower for short-term transport and -80\u00b0C for long-term storage [22]. However, these temperature settings are not always possible in a field environment. Nanotrap particles have previously been found to protect analytes from proteolytic degradation by trapping the protein of interest within the particles while simultaneously excluding proteases such as trypsin [8,9]. Furthermore, the hydrogel particles shrink at elevated temperatures above 34\u00b0C [23], further trapping the analytes within the particles. We have expanded upon these findings by demonstrating that the Nanotrap particles can not only capture and enrich RVFV NP in the presence of abundant resident proteins that are found in serum, but also protect the viral antigen from degradation for at least 120 hours at both ambient and elevated temperatures. This sample preparation technology will allow for sufficient collection and transfer of clinical samples from a field or hospital setting to a laboratory for subsequent testing.",

This NT capture method could be coupled to other downstream assays. Sensitivity issues are a common problem during ELISA diagnostics as viral titers often fall below the threshold of detection. While viral titers in RVFV-infected individuals can be very high, titers start to decrease after a short period of time. For antigen (Ag)-capture ELISA, samples must be collected during a small window of time (ranging from 2 to 6 days) or false-negative results may occur [5,24]. Our western blot results suggest a 100-fold increase in NP detection after Nanotrap particle incubation. Specifically, our limit of detection experiments demonstrated the enhanced detection of NP after Nanotrap particle incubation at low viral titers that would have normally rendered a false-negative result. We anticipate similar results with Ag-capture ELISAs. Our future goals are to utilize the Nanotrap particles to exclude the high-abundant molecules while concentrating NP in high-volume samples (up to 10 ml). Our aim is to increase the sensitivity range for Ag-capture ELISAs to be comparable or exceeding that of current PCR methodologies. Some buffers that efficiently elute proteins out of the Nanotrap particles can interfere with antigen-antibody capture for ELISAs. Therefore, our goal is to identify an elution method that efficiently elutes our sample off of the particles and is compatible with ELISAs. Alternatively, new generations of Nanotrap particles that are \"degradable\" may provide an effective solution to coupling the particles with ELISAs.",

As previously mentioned, the promiscuity of the Nanotrap particles allows for the enrichment of both host and viral antigens from a single sample. Since host protein biomarkers are typically of low abundance and size, they are easily missed in favor of large, high-abundant molecules that make up the majority of the circulating proteins, with albumin itself accounting for 55% of the proteins found in plasma samples [25]. This is a common problem with mass spectrometry, which requires a very small sample size and starting mass in the range of 0.1\u201310\u03bcg per protein [26]. The size sieving property of the Nanotrap particles excludes large biomolecules while concentrating small, low-abundant biomarkers. A number of recent papers have demonstrated the enhanced detection of several biomarkers with these particles. Longo et al. demonstrated the detection of the platelet-derived growth factor protein at previously undetectable levels [17]. Another study demonstrated the sequestration and concentration of the host cytokines interleukin-6 (IL6) and interleukin-8 (IL8) with Nanotrap particles. Importantly, these proteins are protected from enzymatic degradation [18]. These findings can be expanded to RVFV biomarker discovery. A recent paper published by Narayanan et al. successfully utilized Nanotrap particles to compare IL8 concentrations in mock-infected and MP12-infected samples [27].

Five milliliters of viral supernatant was added to the concentrators and centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 7 minutes until approximately 500 \u03bcl remained on the top portion of the concentrator. A) The top (T) and bottom (B) fractions, as well as control sample (C) containing the original sample before processing were analyzed by western blot using antibodies against NP (EC22 antibody). C, T, and B lysates were undiluted (neat). Cytoplasmic extract (CE) control is 7.7 \u03bcg/ml of RVFV infected Vero cell lysates. B) Plaque assays were performed with both fractions and the control sample. C) Densitometry analysis was performed to determine the NP band densities in the T and B fractions. The percent of total NP was determined by dividing the top or bottom portion's band density by the total NP band density (top and bottom portions added together) and multiplying by 100. D) NP band density per pfu values were calculated by dividing the NP band densities by the total pfu values.",
