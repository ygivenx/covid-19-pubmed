Regularly scheduled infusions of IG replace or supplement antibodies that decrease the risk of the serious bacterial and viral infections experienced by PIDD patients [6\u20138]. Although all available preparations of immune globulin provide sufficient antibodies to significantly decrease the frequency of infections in immunodeficient patients, infections continue to occur [2, 6]. Previous studies have suggested that some infections in antibody-deficient PIDD patients occur when the titer of protective antibody is inadequate [9\u201312]. While many of these reports have focused on bacterial pathogens, additional evidence supports the proposition that high titer anti-viral antibody preparations may provide advantages over conventional IG [13, 14].",

When this product was available, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated that for children with severe immunodeficiencies receiving IG therapy during the winter months, physicians could consider the addition and/or substitution of the high titer RSV-IVIG for standard IG supplementation [17]. These data suggested that a polyclonal anti-RSV hyperimmune globulin would confer enhanced protection from infection. Despite the successful use of this RSV-IVIG in premature infants, it was voluntarily withdrawn after the introduction of a monoclonal anti-RSV (Synagis\u00ae) antibody that could be administered intramuscularly rather than intravenously as was required for the polyclonal antibody [14]. Consequently, a new IG formulation that meets all the standard criteria for treatment of PIDD (RI-002) was developed using plasma collected from individuals tested to have high titer anti-RSV antibodies [18].",

There was a 5.47-fold increase in the titer of anti-RSV neutralizing antibody immediately after infusion of the IVIG and a 6.79-fold increase in those subjects who received greater than 500 mg/kg (Table 3). In this calculation, baseline was that value of anti-RSV measured immediately prior to entry into the trial. Figure 1 shows the pharmacokinetics of anti-RSV antibodies, and in this situation, baseline was the value of anti-RSV that was measured in the subjects enrolled in the PK portion of the study immediately prior to infusion of the seventh or ninth dose of IVIG. RI-002 is manufactured to contain standardized, elevated levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV, and all lots are tested for release potency for RSV antibody levels. There was no apparent difference between groups in the mean plasma concentrations of IgG and the mean values for Cmax despite a slightly larger AUC over the dosing interval due to the 7-day longer period. Although the mean values for t\u00bd should be considered as qualitative because of the period of time over which \u03bbz was measured, they are consistent with literature values for the t\u00bd of IgG.\n\n",

            "text": "Among the viral infections that cause substantial morbidity, respiratory syncytial virus is a particular problem, especially in patients with coexistent pulmonary disease [19, 20]. In 1996, an anti-RSV hyper-immune globulin product, RSV-IVIG (RespiGam\u00ae), was approved for the prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in premature infants whose gestational age was less than 32 weeks. Studies suggested that RSV-IVIG reduced disease severity in infants who became infected with RSV, shortening hospital stays compared to age-matched controls [15, 16, 21]. Despite these beneficial effects, RSV-IVIG was voluntarily removed from the market by the manufacturer in favor of an intramuscularly administrated monoclonal anti-RSV antibody palivizumab (Synagis\u00ae). There are no direct head to head clinical studies comparing the efficacy of RSV-IVIG to palivizumab [17]. While both appear comparable in their ability to prevent RSV infections in low birth weight infants, there appear to be certain clinical advantages of the polyclonal antibody [17]. In the PREVENT study, not only was RSV-IVIG able to prevent RSV infections but it also reduced the incidence of other, non-RSV-related upper respiratory diseases [15]. Another study demonstrated that high-risk infants receiving RSV-IVIG had a statistically significant reduction in the overall frequency of otitis media compared with placebo-treated subjects, also suggesting that polyclonal antibody activity to other pathogens may have contributed to this reduction observed in the incidence of otitis media [21]. Interestingly, in the current study, there was only one single reported case of otitis media, an exceedingly low incidence for this population of subjects in the study. Recently published studies in the cotton rat demonstrated that RI-002 can not only reduce the viral load in normal and immune suppressed cotton rats that have been infected with RSV, but that it can dramatically reverse the intense inflammatory changes that are observed in their pulmonary tissue [22].",

            "text": "Because of the historical data suggesting the potential value of a polyclonal anti-RSV, IG product for the immune-compromised patient population, a new Ig formulation was developed. The new product, RI-002, is an IVIG that is manufactured and standardized to contain elevated levels of anti-RSV neutralizing antibody and, in this regard, is comparable to RespiGam\u00ae [22\u201324]. However, this new product has the added advantage that it is manufactured to comply with the FDA guidance for IG products for the treatment of patients with PIDD [18]. Similar to other IGs, this IVIG (RI-002) was made from plasma collected from more than 1000 plasma donors and was manufactured using an FDA-approved fractionation and purification process [25, 26]. Unlike other IGs, the plasma that was used to produce RI-002 was collected from donors who were identified and selected to have high neutralizing antibody titers to RSV. The selection was based on testing results obtained utilizing a validated RSV live-virus microneutralization assay. There was as great as a 6.79-fold increase in the levels of anti-RSV neutralizing antibody that was measured in subjects who were on the dosing regimen of greater than 500 mg/kg. Interestingly, the lots of IVIG produced from RSV hyperimmune donors were also found to have significantly elevated antibody titers to other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza type 1 and 3, influenza, coronavirus, and metapneumovirus) as compared to ten other commercial lots of IG [27]. This preparation of RI-002, therefore, can be regarded as having a unique antibody profile for multiple respiratory viruses that differentiates it from other commercially available IGs. Viewed in the context of data from other IG trials, there are many of the secondary efficacy endpoints, for example number of days missed from work/school/daycare (1.66 per subject per year), hospitalization per subject per year (0.018), and unscheduled visits to the physician or emergency room (0.72 per subject per year) compared favorably to these published trials [25, 28\u201330]. This study demonstrated excellent outcomes that might reflect the unique antibody profile of RI-002.",

The unexpectedly low rate of infection-related outcomes suggests that the unique, anti-viral antibody profile of RI-002 may be important in the prevention of infections in PIDD subjects and raises novel questions about the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of the infectious complications of PIDD. Since it has been reported that pulmonary viral infections are often the antecedent to bacterial pulmonary infections, it is tempting to speculate that an IVIG that has high titer antibodies to viruses may also have an impact on reducing the incidence of bacterial infections.",
