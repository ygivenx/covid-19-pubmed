In recent years, two novel tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), and Heartland virus (HRTV) have been shown to be correlated with severe human disease, having caused fatalities in East Asian countries and in the United States [4\u20137]. With the rapid development of metagenomics, more and more novel arboviruses have been identified from various hosts [8]. In 2014, Shen et al. [9] isolated one viral strain that displayed a strong evolutionary relationship with SFTSV from Dermacentor nuttalli ticks in the Xinjiang uygur autonomous region of China. Analysis of the phylogenetic tree constructed for this virus indicates that it belongs to the genus Banyangvirus in the family of Phenuiviridae, and named Guertu virus (GTV) [9, 10].",

The Gn protein plays a critical role in virion formation and in adhesion to new target cells [12], and helps viruses enter their target cells, which is the main target of neutralizing antibodies [13]. Thus, elucidating the B-cell epitopes (BCE) in the conserved domain or in the immunodominant region of GTV-Gn is very important to determine how the virus interacts with its host cells and to develop viral detection methods and vaccines [14].",

            "text": "Linear epitope mapping is an active area in viral investigation due to possible applications related to peptide vaccine development, antibody production, disease diagnosis and therapy [16]. So far there has been many epitope mapping approaches, such as recombinant (r-) DNA technology, chemically synthetic peptides or peptide chip method, and phage display libraries and so on [17\u201320]. However, a common defect of those methods is no way to identify an epitope minimal motif employing polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), and thus it is impossible to know entire BCEs on a target protein. Recently, the obstacle in epitope mapping has been overcome as the novel biosynthetic peptide (BSP) method with many merits was developed, in which short peptides (minimum 3mer peptide) fused with the truncated GST188 protein can be arbitrarily biosynthesized using the expression plasmid pXXGST-1 [21], Then the BSP method was further modified, which makes it more convenient to screen r- clones of encoding short peptides by SDS-PAGE analysis, that is, the screening of r-clones no longer requires to use control GST188 protein expressed by pXXGST-2 plasmid, when using newly constructed pXXGST-3 plasmid to express short peptides fused with GST188 carrier [22]. Xu et al. have used their own developed method to identify many fine BCEs on human zona pellucida glycoprotein-3 (hZP3) and human hZP4 using rabbit pAbs [21, 23], and especially to reveal three fine rabbit IgG-epitomes of human papilloma virus type 58 (HPV58) E6, E7 and L1 proteins for the first time [24]. In our previous studies, a lot of fine BCEs on the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) nucleoprotein (NP) and Gn were identified also using the method [25, 26], of which all the identified BCEs were recognized by anti-CCHFV positive sheep serum, confirming that the BSP method is credible and easy to operate for epitope mapping.",

For EGn2, whether there is antibody cross-reactivity within homologous proteins remain to be determined using its similar peptide with one residue mutation. Interestingly, the EGn1 and EGn7 BCEs were specific for GST because of three residues mutation happened at the site corresponding to each BCE motif in homologous proteins of 10 SFTSV strains (Fig 7), indicating that they together with EGn6 all can be used as diagnostic reagents to test GTV-infection.",

Each BCE or AP was labeled with different color, for which two overlapping residues between EGn3 and EGn4 was shown in yellow (Fig 7). This result showed that all BCEs and APs were located on the surface of Gn-3D structure (Fig 8B and 8C), indicating the antibody accessibility of them. The secondary structure of the Gn1-431 was predicted using various methods [29\u201332] (Fig 8A). The predicted results indicated that there is no transmembrane domain and signal peptide sequence in Gn1-431. 3D models and protein secondary structure predictions indicated that the predicted results were consistent with the mapped BCEs and APs, and they were all located in the hydrophilic region (Fig 8A). In addition, based on the results obtained from these analyses, seven BCEs and two APs showed the features of good hydrophilicity, antibody accessibility, high flexibility and strong antigenicity, which would lay the foundation for selecting them as candidates for development of sheep GTV peptide vaccine or diagnostic antigen in the future.",

In the study on Hantaan virus, most of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were found to specifically target Gn and Gc proteins [35]. Compared to the glycosylation sites (12NKSA15 and 42NHSQ45) of the Gn from SFTSV HB29 strain, analysis of glycosylation sites (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc) of GTV-Gn in this study showed two N-glycosylation sites (12NKSA15 and 42NHTQ45). Cysteines responsible for disulfide bonds formation and multimerization, and two hydrophobic loops important for fusion are fully conserved among GP proteins of the GTV, SFTSV, and HRTV [9]. The key residue responsible for hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with an antibody is conserved in GTV- and SFTSV-Gn proteins, suggesting that GTV-Gn is likely to be recognized by the antibody derived from SFTSV [9]. However, there are still no reports on the antigenic region of the GTV-Gn. To investigate antigenic sites on GTV-Gn, epitope mapping of the Gn was performed by using rabbit pAbs and the improve BSP method [22], by which seven fine BCEs and two APs were identified. Interestingly, the EGn1 motif is found to be closely linked to the first glycosylation site (12NKSA15) of GST-Gn (Fig 7), suggesting that the antibody induced by EGn1 might prevent glycosylation of this site through the inhibition of spatial conformation, and the biological/immunological significance of the mapped BCE remains to be studied in the future.",

Thus, the antiserum of sheep GTV-infection was utilized to compare the Gn antigenicity between rabbit and sheep in this work. As shown in Fig 6, 6 of mapped 9 BCEs could reacted with sheep antiserum to GTV, and three (EGn3, AP-8 and AP-9) did not show immunogenic in sheep, which the results clearly reflected the better similarity and some differences of the immune response to GTV-Gn in rabbit and sheep. It is a common phenomenon for many species studied; for instance, the sheep serum to peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) could recognize 9 of 13 BCEs on hemagglutinin (H) protein of PPRV [36], and the murine pAbs to HPV58 L1-VLP could react with 13 of 18 BCEs mapped by rabbit pAbs to r-HPV58-L1 [24]. Notably, the completely similar antibody-responses to a given antigen also existed between various species sometimes; for instance, all rabbit IgG-BCEs on NPs of CCHFV/PPRV could react with the antisera from sheep CCHFV or PPRV-infected [25, 37], and the antibodies to three of \u03b2-hCG BCEs present in a chimeric peptide immunogen all were generated in both rabbit and mice [38]. These results indicate that the immune systems of rabbit, murine and sheep could recognize most and/or all of antigenic sites present in a given antigen despite differing greatly in biology and genetics for them, and thus can explain why there are too many reports on identifying BCEs on various viral proteins with rabbit and mouse antisera. To our knowledge, there are few reports about the immunogenic comparison of viral proteins between human and rabbit or murine as mentioned above, although many researches were carried employing the sera from patients or convalescents with various virus infection for epitope mapping [39\u201341]. In this work, we also tried to investigate whether a conserved EGn5 could be recognized by the serum of a patient with infected-SFTSV (because of no sera from patient infected-GTV), but failed to achieve the desired result. Because it is an interesting scientific question and the need of future application to know similarity of mapped BCEs within rabbit and human, the study will be continued if we could collect the human antisera to GTV later on.",

Thus, we analyzed the hydrophilicity and antigenic region of those linear BCEs. Our results clearly indicated that all mapped BCEs are located in the hydrophilic domains and six of the nine identified BCEs from this study are consistent with the result predicted for the antigenic BCEs (Fig 8A). When these BCEs are located in the constructed 3D model, it is obvious that they occupy a relatively large and accessible surface area (Fig 8B and 8C), which is consistent with the expected. This suggests that the epitope prediction tool combined with the biosynthetic peptide method is reliable, which could reduce the work load and cost of epitope mapping in immune diagnosis and fine BCE motif recognition [26]. However, whether the identified BCEs could improve the sensitivity of virus detection and be efficacious in a vaccine remains to be further investigation.",

The BSP method can be used under standard laboratory conditions, making it a useful for fine BCE motifs mapping with pAbs [37, 43]. For example, Yu et al. [37] identified 19 linear BCEs on H protein encoded by PPRV and Liu et al. [43] mapped 5 BCEs on NP2 from CCHFV that all were recognized by CCHFV-positive sheep serum, respectively. In addition, the longest linear BCE (EGn1) with 11 residues was identified in Western blotting with the BSP method. The result in the present study indicates that six BCEs of EGn1, EGn2, EGn4, EGn5, EGn6 and EGn7 were specifically recognized by antibody-positive sera from sheep with GTV infection in Western blotting (Fig 6), but the EGn3, AP-8 and AP-9 did not.

[11] have studied the complicated structure of the viral head Gn envelope protein of SFTSV and the activities of neutralizing antibodies against it, and found that the Gn-containing head is similar to that of RVFV that it comprises a compact triangle with different arrangements (Subdomain \u2160, II and III). Subdomain III is recognized by specific neutralizing antibodies, and subdomain II is mainly recognized by broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies [11]. Although SFTSV has a close evolutionary relationship with GTV, current investigations on the GTV-Gn protein structure are still not complete. We speculated that the corresponding domain of GTV-Gn protein has similar characteristics to that of SFTSV. MSA indicated that seven BCEs and two APs were presumed to be located in the subdomain II and III of the GTV-Gn, could be recognized by broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies. However, whether the identified seven BCEs and two APs of GTV-Gn in this study have neutralizing activity still requires further verification.",
