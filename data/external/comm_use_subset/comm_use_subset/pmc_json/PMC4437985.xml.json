Dihydropyrimidinase, a component in the chain of pyrimidine catabolism, is also capable of detoxifying xenobiotics with an imide functional group that ranges from linear imides to heterocyclic imides [3,4,5] and organic cyclic carbonates [6]. These different imide-hydrolyzing enzymes from microorganisms are normally known as hydantoinase because of their role as biocatalysts in the synthesis of D- and L-amino acids for the industrial production of the precursors of antibiotics [7,8]. Although dihydropyrimidinase and hydantoinase generally have a similar active site, their overall sequence identity and substrate specificity differ [9]. Thus, some bacterial hydantoinases are still named and identified as dihydropyrimidinase because of the catalytic activity toward the natural substrates dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine.",

            "text": "Based on their functional and structural similarities, dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, imidase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase belong to the cyclic amidohydrolase family [10]. Even if these enzymes have similar functions, they have relatively low amino acid sequence identity. These metal-dependent enzymes catalyze the ring-opening hydrolysis of the cyclic amide bond of each substrate in either five- or six-membered rings in the metabolism of purines, pyrimidines, and many xenobiotics (Fig 1A) [9,11,12,13]. Almost all the active sites of dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase contain four histidines, one aspartate, and one post-carboxylated lysine residue, which are required for metal binding and catalytic activity. The presence of a post-carboxylated lysine in hydantoinase is also required in binuclear metal center self-assembly [12], and it increases the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide for catalysis [14]. Previous studies indicated that cyclic amidohydrolases should use a nearly identical mechanism for catalysis. However, the substrate selectivity and specificity of dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase highly differ. For example, dihydroorotase does not hydrolyze dihydropyrimidine, hydantoin, and allantoin [15]. Thus, whether the substrate and inhibitor of each enzyme in this family competitively inhibit dihydropyrimidinase remains unclear.",

Dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide were used as substrates. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, dihydrouracil (2 mM) was used as the substrate in the standard assay of dihydropyrimidinase. Briefly, the decrease in absorbancy at 230, 248, and 298 nm was measured upon hydrolysis of dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide as the substrate at 25\u00b0C, respectively. To start the reaction, the purified dihydropyrimidinase (10\u201370 \u03bcg) was added to a 2 mL solution containing the substrate and 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0). Substrate hydrolysis was monitored with a UV/vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U 3300, Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). The extinction coefficient of each substrate was determined experimentally by direct measurement with a spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficients of dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide were 0.683 mM-1cm-1 at 230 nm, 0.0538 mM-1cm-1 at 248 nm, and 3.12 mM-1cm-1 at 298 nm, respectively. The initial rates of change were a function of enzyme concentration within the absorbance range of 0.01\u20130.18 min-1. A unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 \u03bcmol substrate/min, and the specific activity was expressed in terms of units of activity per milligram of enzyme. The kinetic parameters K\nm and V\nmax were determined from a non-linear plot by fitting the hydrolyzing rate from individual experiments to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation (Enzyme Kinetics module of Sigma-Plot; Systat Software, Chicago, IL, USA).",

To ensure that the gene product of PA0441 is suitably identified as a dihydropyrimidinase, we analyzed the substrate specificity of this dihydropyrimidinase toward dihydrouracil (Fig 1B), phthalimide (Fig 1C), 5-propyl-hydantoin (Fig 1D), allantoin, and dihydroorotate, which are typical substrates for dihydropyrimidinase, imidase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase, respectively (Table 3). Unlike A. radiobacter hydantoinase, the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme toward dihydrouracil was higher than that toward phthalimide (fourfold) and 5-propyl-hydantoin (100-fold).

We also tested whether inhibitors of the metalloenzyme glutaminyl cyclase, namely, N-\u03c9-acetylhistamine, 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole [39,40], are potential inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase, in which 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole at 100\u2013750 mM affected enzyme activity (Fig 2). High concentrations of these compounds were required to obtain significant inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase. Thus, inhibitors or substrate analogs of allantoinase, dihydroorotase, and glutaminyl cyclase were not potent inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase.",

No effect was found when myricitrin was added into the standard assay using dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin as substrates of dihydropyrimidinase. However, opposite to myricitrin, dihydromyricetin exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the activities of dihydropyrimidinase for both substrates, even more than myricetin did (Fig 3B and 3C). The IC50 values of dihydromyricetin for dihydropyrimidinase determined from the titration curves using dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin were 48 \u00b1 2 and 40 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM, respectively; myricetin yielded higher values of 83 \u00b1 3 and 63 \u00b1 3 \u03bcM, respectively.

Moreover, the order of the inhibitory capability of the flavonoids for 5-propyl-hydantoin was as follows: dihydromyricetin > myricetin > galangin > kaempferol > quercetin > myricitrin. Thus, for the first time, flavonols, especially dihydromyricetin, were established as novel inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase.

Human dihydropyrimidinase (PDB entry: 2VR2) was the first hit suggested as a template by the program.

(PS)2 (http://140.113.239.111/~ps2v2/docs.php) is an automatic homology modeling server that combines both sequence and secondary structure information to detect the homologous proteins with remote similarity and target\u2013template alignment. Human dihydropyrimidinase was also the first hit suggested as a template by (PS)2 because it had the highest score.

Quenching refers to the complex formation process that decreases the fluorescence intensity of the protein. The fluorescence emission spectra of dihydropyrimidinase were remarkably quenched with dihydromyricetin (Fig 7A) and myricetin (Fig 7B). Upon adding 50 \u03bcM myricetin and dihydromyricetin, the intrinsic fluorescence of dihydropyrimidinase was quenched by 56.2% and 89.1%, respectively. As shown in Fig 7B, adding different concentrations of myricetin resulted in a red shift (~7 nm; \u03bbmax = 333.5\u2013340.5 nm) in the dihydropyrimidinase emission wavelength (\u03bbem). Adding dihydromyricetin also caused a red shift in the dihydropyrimidinase emission wavelength (Fig 7A), which was much more significant (~25 nm; \u03bbmax = 333.5\u2013358.5 nm). These observations indicated that myricetin and dihydromyricetin interacted with dihydropyrimidinase, thereby suggesting that myricetin and dihydromyricetin could form stable complexes with dihydropyrimidinase. The K\nd values of dihydropyrimidinase bound to myricetin and dihydromyricetin, as determined through their titration curves (Fig 7C), were 28.8 \u00b1 2.2 and 22.6 \u00b1 2.6 \u03bcM, respectively.",

These different possible binding modes were also revealed by the distinct fluorescence quenching spectra, in which their \u03bbmax shifts differed significantly (Fig 7). The docking study showed that N337 interacted with the hydroxyl group on the ring of myricetin, but not dihydromyricetin. Thus, fluorescence quenching of the N337A mutant was also carried out to test whether this residue is important for myricetin binding, but not for dihydromyricetin. Myricetin and dihydromyricetin quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of dihydropyrimidinase by 58.4% and 86.3%, respectively (Fig 8). Adding myricetin and dihydromyricetin resulted in red shifts in \u03bbmax of the N337A mutant from 333.5 nm to 341 nm (~7.5 nm) and 357 nm (~23.5 nm), respectively. The \u03bbmax shifts of the N337A mutant by myricetin and dihydromyricetin were similar, but still slightly different, to those of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase (Fig 7). The K\nd value of the N337A mutant bound to myricetin (Fig 8C), compared with that of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase, was reduced to 59.3 \u00b1 8.6 \u03bcM (twofold). However, the K\nd value of the N337A mutant for dihydromyricetin binding was 24.1 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcM, a value nearly identical to that of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase, which suggested that N337 was important for myricetin binding but not for dihydromyricetin. These observations indicated that myricetin and dihydromyricetin could still form stable complexes with the N337A mutant, but the binding environment of the active site within the N337A mutant was somewhat different from that of the wild-type protein.",

Considering that dihydropyrimidinase is a component in the chain of pyrimidine catabolism required for metabolizing the DNA base, blocking this enzyme\u2019s activity may be useful to limit bacterial growth and survival. Although some chelators are known to inhibit dihydropyrimidinase, they are harmful to humans.

Furthermore, the metabolic effects and safety of the flavonols are well established, making flavonols beneficial for humans.

Although flavonols are known to have several hydroxyl groups, thought to have remarkable potential for binding any protein, the strength of the flavonols\u2019 inhibitory effect (IC50) on dihydropyrimidinase was not correlated with the number of hydroxyl substituents on the flavonols\u2019 aromatic rings. In addition, the inhibitory effect (IC50) of flavonols on dihydropyrimidinase was substrate-dependent. For example, as shown in Fig 3, the inhibitory effect of kaempferol on the activity of dihydropyrimidinase was significant only with dihydrouracil as a substrate (with IC50 value of 50 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM), but not with 5-propyl-hydantoin.

Due to the low bioavailability of cobalt on earth and in cells, we thought that the possibility of a biological role playing in dihydropyrimidinase may be ruled out. The higher activity of the Co2+-substituted enzymes has been proposed. The higher activity followed by metal replacement in Co(II)-thermolysin than in native thermolysin may be due to the enhancement of stabilization of the transition state than those of the native thermolysin [47]. For imidase, the sizes of the metal are found as the important factors that affect the activity of imidase [4]. The position of nucleophilic attack on an imide substrate may fluctuate due to size of the coordinating metal ion. Because the crystal structure of the Co2+-dihydropyrimidinase is still lacking, both these possibilities cannot be ruled out.",

The model was directly constructed by superimposing the modeled structure of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase with the crystal structure of S. kluyveri dihydropyrimidinase-dihydrouracil complex. Dihydrouracil generated from the complex is shown in light magenta. (B) An alignment consensus of 497 sequenced dihydropyrimidinase homologs by ConSurf reveals the degree of variability at each position along the primary sequence. Note that the positions involved in the assembly of the binuclear metal center within the active site and the substrate binding of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase are well conserved.",
