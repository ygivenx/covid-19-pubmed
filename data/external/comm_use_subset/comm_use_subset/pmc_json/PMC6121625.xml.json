It not only harms individuals, but also causes harm on a macro scale and, therefore, is regarded as a social problem [1]. At the Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC), infectious disease surveillance is a comprehensive process in which information on infectious disease outbreaks and vectors are continuously and systematically collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Moreover, the results are distributed quickly to people who need them to prevent and control infectious disease. The KCDC operates a mandatory surveillance system in which mandatory reports are made without delay to the relevant health center when an infectious disease occurs and it operates a sentinel surveillance system in which the medical organization that has been designated as the sentinel reports to the relevant health center within seven days. The targets of mandatory surveillance consist of a total of 59 infectious diseases from Groups 1 to 4 by the KCDC. The targets of sentinel surveillance include influenza from Group 3 along with 21 infectious diseases from Group 5. Overall, a total of 80 infectious diseases in six groups are monitored. In the current Korean infectious disease reporting system, if there is a legally defined infectious disease patient at a medical organization, a report is made to the managing health center through the infectious disease web reporting system. The managing health center reports to the city and province health offices through another system and the city and province health offices report to the KCDC.",

            "text": "In the conventional reporting system, some medical organizations\u2019 infectious disease reports are incomplete and delays can occur in the reporting system. For instance, in the traditional influenza surveillance system, around two weeks elapses between when a report is made and when it is disseminated [2]. The KCDC has been running an automated infectious disease reporting system as a pilot project since 2015. However, by 2017, only 2.3% of all medical organizations were participating in the pilot project. In medical organizations using the conventional infectious disease reporting system, a large number of missing and delayed reports can occur, which hinders a prompt response to infectious disease. As such, it is necessary to create a data-based infectious disease prediction model to handle situations in real time. Furthermore, if this model can understand the extent of infectious disease trends, the costs to society from infectious disease can be minimized.",

            "text": "An increasing number of researchers recognize these facts and are performing data-based infectious disease surveillance studies to supplement existing systems and design new models [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Among these, studies are currently being performed on detecting infectious disease using big data such as Internet search queries [10,11,12,13,14,15]. The Internet search data can be gathered and processed at a speed that is close to real time. According to Towers et al., Internet search data can create surveillance data faster than conventional surveillance systems [16]. For example, when Huang et al. predicted hand, foot, and mouth disease using the generalized additive model (GAM), the model that included search query data obtained the best results. As such, it has been reported that new big data surveillance tools have the advantage of being easy to access and can identify infectious disease trends before official organizations [17]. In addition to Internet search data, social media big data is also being considered. Tenkanen et al. report that social media big data is relatively easy to collect and can be used freely, which means accessibility is satisfactory and the data is created continuously in real time with rich content [18]. As such, studies have used Twitter data to predict the occurrences of mental illness [19] and infectious disease [20,21,22,23] in addition to predictions in a variety of other scientific fields [24,25,26,27]. In particular, a study by Shin et al. reported that infectious diseases and Twitter data are highly correlated. There is the possibility of using digital surveillance systems to monitor infectious disease in the future [20]. When these points are considered, using search query data and social media big data should have a positive effect on infectious disease predictions.",

Deep learning yields satisfactory results when it is used to perform tasks that are difficult for conventional analysis methods [31,32,33]. In a study by Xu et al., a model that used deep learning yielded better prediction performance than the generalized linear model (GLM), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model, and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model [28].

However, as discussed above, it is necessary to also consider various big data and environmental factors such as weather when predicting infectious disease. In addition, in the case of models that use deep learning, it is possible to improve prediction performance by optimizing the deep learning model by optimizing its parameters. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design a model that uses the infectious disease occurrence data provided by the KCDC, search query data from search engines that are specialized for South Korea, Twitter social media big data, and weather data such as temperature and humidity. According to a study by Kwon et al., a model that considers the time difference between clinical and non-clinical data can detect infectious disease outbreaks one to two weeks before current surveillance systems [43]. Therefore, this study adds lag to the collected dataset to take temporal characteristics into account. In addition, in the design process, a thorough testing of all the input variable combinations is performed to examine the effects of each resulting dataset on infectious disease outbreaks and select the optimal model with the most explanatory power. The model\u2019s prediction performance is verified by comparing it with an infectious disease prediction model that uses a deep learning method and an infectious disease prediction model that uses time series analysis.",

The standards for the non-clinical data are as follows. Data from 576 days between 1 January, 2016 and 29 July, 2017 was used. The infectious diseases selected for this study are subject to mandatory reporting. Unlike those diseases subject to mandatory reporting, diseases subject to sentinel reporting aggregate data on a weekly basis. Since prediction is also performed on a weekly basis, it is difficult to cope with infectious diseases in real time. Therefore, diseases that are subject to sentinel reporting were excluded from the study. Moreover, the study excluded infectious diseases with an annual occurrence rate of less than 100 as well as infectious diseases that have a statistically insignificant model with an adjusted R-squared value of less than 0.25 when regression analysis is performed using all variables. Three infectious diseases satisfied all conditions, which include malaria, chickenpox, and scarlet fever. The search data was collected from the Naver Data Lab (https://datalab.naver.com/keyword/trendSearch.naver). The usage share data provided by InternetTrend (http://internettrend.co.kr/trendForward.tsp) on search engines in the health/medicine field in the first half of 2017 shows that the Naver search engine had the highest usage share (86.1%) in South Korea. Therefore, it was chosen as the search engine for extracting search data. Note that the collected search data consists of only Korean terms because the search engine is specific to South Korea. The search queries used in this study consisted of the infectious disease\u2019s proper name and symptoms (e.g., \u201cchickenpox\u201d and \u201cchickenpox symptoms\u201d in Korea). The frequency of inquiries using these search queries were used as the search data. The number of searches were normalized with respect to the largest number of searches within the study period.",

However, there is a gradient problem in that the effect of a given input on the hidden layer can be increased or decreased significantly during the circular connection. As new inputs are overwritten, the sensitivity of the first input decreases over time. Therefore, the network is \u201cforgotten\u201d. The input gate, output gate, and forget gate are non-linear summation units that control the activation of the cell. The forget gate multiplies the previous state of the cell while the input and output gates multiply the IO of the cell. The activation function f of the gate is a logistic sigmoid. The IO activation functions g and h of the cell usually use hyperbolic tangents or logistic sigmoids. However, in some cases, h uses the identity function. As long as the forget gate is open and the input gate is closed, the memory cell continues to remember the first input. In this way, LSTM is an algorithm that resolves a problem in traditional RNNs [48].",

The scarlet fever model yielded significant results for the Naver search queries and humidity. Additionally, the malaria model yielded significant results for the Naver search queries and temperature (p < 0.05). Looking at these results together, the Naver search query data was significant for all three infectious diseases and the Twitter data was not significant for any of the three. It can be seen that the Internet search query data can be used to design an infectious disease prediction model, which was reported by previous studies. However, the results for the Twitter data differ from the results of previous studies. This is believed to be because Naver accounted for the largest share (86.2%) of Korean search engine use in the health/medicine field for the first half of 2017 while Twitter accounted for the smallest share (0.5%) of social media use in the health/medicine field for the same time period (http://internettrend.co.kr/trendForward.tsp). However, the Twitter data had an effect on the process of finding the model with the highest adjusted R-squared value. Therefore, it is expected to have an effect on future analysis as well. The temperature had a significant relationship with all infectious diseases except for scarlet fever and humidity had a significant relationship with all infectious diseases except for malaria. The values of the coefficients show that the most significant variables for chickenpox and scarlet fever was the Naver search query data (4.4589 and 2.1956, respectively) and, for malaria, it was the temperature values (0.0770). The effect of Naver search query data in particular was significant for all three infectious diseases, which confirms that it can be suitable for predicting infectious disease.",

When the prediction performances of each model were compared based on RMSE, the top 10 DNN models showed a 24.45% performance improvement compared to the ARIMA model. The mean RMSE of the 10 LSTM models was 78.2850, which is higher than the DNN models. The standard deviation was 3.64, which shows that the difference among LSTM models was more marked than the difference among DNN models. Despite this, the top 10 LSTM models achieved an 18.78% performance improvement over the ARIMA model on average. There was a difference between the DNN and LSTM models\u2019 average figures and standard deviations. However, in the models with the lowest RMSE for each analysis method, there was not a big difference, which indicates that there was not a large difference in performance when the optimal parameters for each analysis method were used.

For the LSTM models, the shapes of the graphs are similar except for the model with the lowest RMSE.

This result infers that a prediction model that is better than existing prediction models can be designed by changing the deep learning parameters to achieve optimization.

The standard deviation of the DNN model (0.80) was also lower than that of the LSTM model (1.37).

Table S3 shows the RMSE and the prediction graphs of the DNN and LSTM models with the lowest RMSE for malaria. Like other infectious diseases, the DNN model prediction graphs have a similar shape. However, the shapes of the LSTM model prediction graphs have a tendency to not follow the trend. The RMSEs of each prediction model, excluding the ARIMA model, showed little difference.

However, actual data can have trends and be irregular. Therefore, deep learning can be an excellent analytical method when analyzing such data and predicting future situations. According to the results of the previous analyses, the deep learning model follows increasing and decreasing trends sufficiently well. Moreover, the DNN and LSTM models were observed to be sensitive to decreasing trends and increasing trends, respectively.",

For this reason, research is being conducted to minimize social losses by predicting the spread of infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to design an infectious disease prediction model that is more suitable than existing models by using various input variables and deep learning techniques. Therefore, in this study, the optimal parameters were set using a variable selection method based on OLS. The relationship between actual instances of disease occurrence and the Internet search query data tends to have a time lag, which means a lag was added to each infectious disease\u2019s dataset to find the future trend. Next, an analysis of ARIMA, DNN, and LSTM was performed with optimal parameters.",

Looking at the results for DNN and LSTM, both the deep learning models made much better predictions than the OLS and ARIMA models for all infectious diseases. Moreover, the DNN models had the best performance on average, but the LSTM models made more accurate predictions when infectious diseases were spreading. However, in the case of malaria, there were few occurrences of the disease compared to other infectious diseases, which means the predictions were not comparatively accurate.",

It also used deep learning analysis, which yields high prediction performance to increase the performance of infectious disease predictions. The results showed that, when selecting the optimal parameters, adding all input variables had the highest explanatory power. This means that, by adding various data, it was possible to design a model with higher explanatory power.

It also constructed traditional prediction models such as OLS, ARIMA, and deep learning prediction models such as DNN and LSTM and compared their prediction performance to confirm that the models that use deep learning are the most suitable for infectious disease prediction. It is believed that infectious disease prediction models that employ deep learning can be used to supplement current infectious disease surveillance systems and, at the same time, predict trends in infectious disease. If this can reduce the time differences in reporting systems so that infectious disease trends can be known immediately, it is expected that immediate responses to infectious disease will become possible and costs to society can be minimized. According to a study by Shin et al., an emerging infectious disease known as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has a deep correlation with Internet search data [20] and it will become possible to expand these methods to the real-time surveillance and prediction of emerging infectious diseases as well.",

The search query data collection time period used in this research was relatively short extending from 1 January 2016 to 29 July 2017. The particular spatial ranges of data were averaged across the whole of South Korea. It is believed that, if the data is expanded and the spatial ranges are subdivided, the model\u2019s performance will improve. In addition, an effort was made to change the DNN and LSTM model parameters and create a variety of prediction models, but the deep learning prediction models used in this study did not cover all the prediction models that could be implemented. Parameters such as hidden layers and batch size were not considered. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that the most effective model was created.
