            "text": "Infections with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes reproductive failures in sows [1] and respiratory disorders particularly in young pigs [2], which results in important economic losses worldwide [3, 4]. Recently, highly pathogenic PRRSV strains have emerged in China [5] and Eastern Europe [6]. PRRSV is an enveloped positive sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae within the order Nidovirales [7]. Two PRRSV genotypes can be distinguished, type 1 PRRSV of European origin and type 2 PRRSV originating from North America and China, both spreading worldwide with high genetic and antigenic diversity [8, 9]. The PRRSV genome consists of at least 10 open reading frames (ORF). ORF 1a and 1b encode the non-structural proteins from two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that are further processed proteolytically, as well as two proteins nsp2TF and nsp2N resulting from ribosomal frameshifts within the nsp2 gene (for a detailed review see [10]). The remaining ORFs encode the structural proteins on subgenomic messenger RNAs. ORF 2a, 2b and 3\u20137, encode the glycoprotein 2 (GP2) also termed GP2a, the non-glycosylated protein 2b also termed E, the glycoproteins GP3, GP4, GP5, the non-glycosylated membrane protein M (from ORF6) and the nucleocapsid protein N (from ORF7), respectively (reviewed in [11]). Recently, an alternative ORF5a protein was identified as a minor component of the equine arteritis virus (EAV) [12] and the PRRSV virions [13]. GP5 and M form a disulphide-linked heterodimer that is essential for the formation of infectious particles [14, 15]. For EAV, the glycoproteins GP2, GP3 and GP4 form a heterotrimeric complex that is stabilised by disulphide bonds, which has not been demonstrated for PRRSV yet (reviewed in [11]). The PRRSV GP5\u2013M and GP2\u2013GP3\u2013GP4 complexes are linked essentially through non-covalent interactions between GP5 and GP4 [16]. The basic protein N associates with the viral RNA genome to form the nucleocapsid. N is the most immunogenic PRRSV structural protein. It elicits a strong antibody response a few days post infection (pi). These antibodies do however not neutralize the virus and are therefore not protective [17]. The major neutralizing epitopes are found on GP5 [18\u201321] and GP4 [22\u201324] which are also the most diverse structural proteins between isolates [25]. Neutralizing epitopes were also found on M, GP3 and GP2 [26\u201328], but their contribution to protection is unclear. GP5 co-expressed with M elicits a better neutralizing Ab response than GP5 alone [29, 30]. However, neutralizing antibodies appear typically several weeks only after the onset of the first antibody response, simultaneously with clearance of the virus from the bloodstream [21, 31].",

MLV are typically more efficacious than inactivated vaccines [38, 39]. Numerous alternative PRRSV vaccine approaches have been explored with limited success so far (reviewed in [32, 40]).

Recombinant VSV replicons lacking the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene and carrying genes of interest instead can be packaged in virus replicon particles (VRP) with high infectious titres using a complementing G-expressing cell line [47]. Such VRP were used successfully in the past to induce protection against SARS coronavirus in a mouse model [48], influenza A virus (IAV) in chickens and mice [49\u201351], and bluetongue virus (BTV) in sheep [52]. VSV VRP are safe due to the lack of glycoprotein G expression, preventing assembly and spread of virus particles. Pigs have typically no pre-existing immunity against VSV. Thus, VSV replicons represent an attractive novel vaccine platform for pigs. They have however not been evaluated in pigs yet. In the present study, VSV VRP were generated to express different combinations of the major and minor PRRSV glycoproteins. The immunogenicity and protective potential of these VRP were assessed in pigs.",

The codon-optimized cDNA of N from the Olot/91 strain (GenBank Accession Number AGW23409) was synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway). For generation of recombinant VSV replicons, GP5 or N were inserted into the plasmid pVSV* using MluI and BstEII restriction sites upstream and downstream of the fourth transcription unit, replacing the G gene of VSV in analogy to a previous report [49]. This replicon contained an additional transcription unit at position 5, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) referred to by an asterisk (*) in the vector nomenclature. The resulting plasmids were designated pVSV*\u0394G(GP5) and pVSV*\u0394G(N), respectively. For generation of a dual antigen expression vector, the M cDNA was inserted into pVSV*\u0394G(GP5) using XhoI and NheI restriction sites, thereby replacing the GFP gene in the fifth transcription unit. The resulting plasmid was designated pVSV\u0394G(GP5/M). For generation of a triple antigen expression vector, the cDNA of GP4, GP3 and GP2 was inserted into a VSV\u0394G vector containing 7 transcription units described recently [53] using the MluI (in case of GP4), XhoI (in case of GP3) and NheI (in case of GP2) restriction sites. The resulting plasmid was designated pVSV\u0394G(GP4/GP3/GP2). For expression of a modified M and GP3 containing a short peptide epitope at the C terminus, the M and GP3 gene, respectively, were inserted without stop codon into the pCMV-3Tag-3A plasmid vector (Agilent Technologies) upstream and in frame with a triple Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK)-coding region followed by a stop codon. The M-Flag and GP3-Flag open reading frames were amplified by PCR and inserted into the fourth transcription unit of pVSV*\u0394G, resulting in the plasmids pVSV*\u0394G(M-Flag) and pVSV*\u0394G(GP3-Flag), respectively. The antigens GP5 and GP4 were modified by fusing a short HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) to the C terminus, while GP2 was modified at the C terminus with a short Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL). The ORFs were inserted into the fourth transcription unit of pVSV*\u0394G resulting in the plasmids pVSV*\u0394G(GP5-HA), pVSV*\u0394G(GP4-HA), and pVSV*\u0394G(GP2-Myc), respectively. For expression of the GP3 ectodomain (GP3ecto) without the C-terminal transmembrane domain, a gene cassette encoding the amino acids 29\u2013176 of GP3 (numbering according to GenBank Accession Number AGW23404) was inserted in frame with the Ig\u03ba leader sequence and an optimal signalase cleavage site in the mammalian expression vector pSecTag-2A (Invitrogen). In this way GP3ecto was fused to a Myc peptide epitope and a histidine tag (6xHis) at the C terminus, followed by a stop codon. This Ig\u03ba-GP3ecto-Myc-6xHis construct was then amplified by PCR and inserted into the fourth transcription unit of pVSV*\u0394G, resulting in the plasmid pVSV*\u0394G(GP3ecto-Myc). For expression of IAV proteins, the cDNA encoding HA, NA, NP and M2 of IAV A/swine/Belzig/2/01 (H1N1) were kindly provided by J\u00fcrgen and Olga Stech (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany). The genes were inserted into the plasmid pVSV* using the MluI and BstEII restriction sites, replacing the G gene of VSV as described [49]. All nucleotide sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The recombinant replicons were propagated in the BHK-G43 helper cell line providing the VSV G protein in trans, yielding infectious VRP with titres of 107\u2013108 infectious units (IU)/mL as described previously [54]. For the titrations, GFP expression was used as readout. For the detection of VRP that did not express GFP, infected cells were fixed with PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min, washed with PBS containing 0.1 M (w/v) glycine and then permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-VSV serum and subsequently with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO) and stained with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC)/H2O2 as substrate. An overview of all constructed VSV VRP is provided in Table 1.",

In order to test this, the immunogenicity of PRRSV and IAV proteins expressed from VSV VRP was assessed in the same animal by co-vaccination with two different VSV VRP constructs expressing a PRRSV protein (N, GP3ecto, GP4 or empty vector) and a IAV protein (HA, M2, NA, NP), respectively, injected at two different sites (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d).

Numerous efforts have been invested and strategies proposed for the development of novel efficacious PRRSV vaccines based on the antigenic properties of the PRRSV structural proteins and on the immunobiology of the virus [32, 34, 59]. Replicon vectors represent an elegant strategy to avoid the biological risks of virus spread and to circumvent potential immune modulating properties of modified live PRRSV vaccines [40]. Therefore, we explored the immunogenic and protective potential of VSV replicon particles as a vectored vaccine approach against PRRSV. Such VRP were successfully used before as efficacious experimental vaccines against SARS, IAV and BTV [48\u201352]. In the present study, VSV replicons were engineered to express PRRSV structural proteins, individually or in combination (Table 1). Emphasis was on GP5, M, GP4 and GP3, since these proteins are important targets for neutralizing and protective antibodies [11, 23, 26, 27], with the major neutralizing epitopes residing on GP5 [18]. Since several studies have shown that co-expression of PRRSV antigens resulted in better humoral and cellular immune responses than expression of the individual proteins [30, 60], GP5, M, GP4, GP3 and GP2 proteins were co-expressed to partly mimic the formation of the GP5/M and GP4/3/2 oligomers.",

Fever was less pronounced when all envelope proteins were included in the vaccine. Enhanced disease following vaccination with recombinant GP5 and M was observed previously [42, 61]. This was attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease during natural infection, which is probably mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies [26, 62]. Such antibodies were shown to increase virus infection in porcine alveolar macrophage cultures and in vivo [62] involving different Fc\u03b3R isoforms [63, 64].",

Nevertheless, the vaccinated pigs seroconverted 15\u201317 days earlier than the mock-vaccinated animals after challenge virus infection, indicating that immunization with the recombinant VRP primed the immune system. In na\u00efve pigs, the delayed seroconversion against the envelope proteins as opposed to the N protein after PRRSV infection or after immunization with vectored vaccines is well documented [31, 40, 42, 59]. Of note, with the MARC-145-adapted Olot/91 virus used in this study, seroconversion against N became detectable 9\u201314 days after challenge only (Tables 2, 3, 4) as opposed to the reported occurrence of anti-N antibodies as early as 5 to 7 days after PRRSV infection [31, 65]. This is probably related to the low level and short duration of replication of the MARC-145-adapted virus in pigs (Figures 5C, D, 6C, D). Despite the poor replication of this virus in vivo, vaccination of pigs with VRP did not result in any significant reduction of viremia. A better immunogenicity of PRRSV proteins was reported when the antigens were modified, coupled to immunostimulatory molecules or administered as purified proteins along with adjuvants [66, 67]. This raises the question whether the immunogenicity of the PRRSV envelope proteins expressed from VRP is affected by glycosylation, subcellular localization, intracellular retention or low stability. In order to elaborate on this, GP3 was modified with the aim of obtaining secreted GP3 by replacing the leader sequence with a canonical Ig\u03ba signal sequence followed by an optimal signalase cleavage site and by deleting the hydrophobic transmembrane anchor. However, the modified GP3 was retained in the cell, and no seroconversion against GP3ecto was obtained in absence of challenge virus infection. The lack of GP3 secretion may be related to the fact that GP3 is naturally retained in intracellular compartments despite the N-terminal signal sequence [11].",

            "text": "In order to address the question whether PRRSV structural proteins are immunogenic at all when expressed by VSV VRP in pigs, a vector expressing PRRSV N protein was included in one vaccination trial. N was chosen because it is the most immunogenic structural protein after PRRSV infection [31, 65]. Indeed, VSV*\u0394G(N) was the only VRP capable of inducing a detectable antibody response in the absence of a viral challenge (Table 4). The co-vaccination experiments with VRP expressing IAV and PRRSV envelope proteins corroborated these results. The IAV proteins were strongly immunogenic while the PRRSV envelope proteins were not, clearly demonstrating that the VSV vector per se is functional in pigs. Although several vector vaccines failed to induce a protective immune response, immunizations essentially primed the immune system to a challenge infection [41, 42]. These reports and the present study altogether suggest that the PRRSV envelope proteins are expressed in a way to hide partially from the immune system. Whether this immune evasion strategy is due solely to glycan shielding [68] or to a particular intracellular topology remains to be investigated. Future efforts in vectored vaccine development should consider these aspects to enhance the immunogenicity of the PRRSV antigens.",
