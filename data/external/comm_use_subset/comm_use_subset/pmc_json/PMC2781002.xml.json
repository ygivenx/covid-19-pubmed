Distance plays a vital role in studies assessing spatial disease patterns as well as access to hospital services. In a highly complex health care environment, even micro-geographic differences in the availability of tertiary services can affect access to care [2,3]. The study of distances from patient homes to the nearest hospital is an example where distance is often studied as a crude but objective indicator of geographic accessibility to hospital services [4]. In such situations, the measurement of actual travel distance (or travel time) on a road network is clearly the most appropriate method [5]. Health service research, however, encompasses a much broader investigation area, where spatial analytical models are employed to assist in the provision of effective accessibility to health care services. Distance is often used indirectly in these types of analysis as one of the parameters defining the model's thrust and its results.",

A commonly-used distance metric is the Euclidean distance, a straight line distance measurement between two points, 'as the crow flies' [7,8]. This method is simple and intuitive, but very few are the applications where it can yield accurate distance estimates. An alternative, well-known distance metric is the Manhattan, or taxi-cab distance: as its name suggests, it is most appropriate for grid-like road networks, typical of many North American cities, characterized by a rectangular city block pattern. The Manhattan metric measures distance between points along a rectangular path with right angle turns [9,10]. Most commonly, travel along road networks involves a mixture of Euclidean, Manhattan, and curvilinear trajectories. There is no firm consensus on methods for selecting a distance metric [11], nor is there much published information on the extent to which Euclidean, Manhattan, and road distances relate to one another in applied distance analysis [12,13].",

            "text": "Travel along a complex, or mixed network can be usefully modeled by a class of distance metrics, known as Minkowski distance [14], which is a general distance metric, of which the Euclidean and Manhattan metrics are special cases. This array of metrics provides flexibility and generality, in that, within a single class of metrics, a range of parameters can be selected; therefore, a single yet flexible method for measuring distance can be defined for the optimal estimation of distance on a variety of empirical road networks. One further important aspect is the fundamental role of time in accessing health care services: if distance is a crude estimate of accessibility, travel time is a more relevant estimate. Travel time computation is no longer a prohibitively time consuming and computationally intensive task, thanks to powerful GIS software, hardware, and rich road network datasets [14-17]. However, actual travel time on a road network is highly variable due to local (spatial and temporal) conditions which are hardly predictable and controllable. Because of this characteristic, travel time computations lack general validity, requiring adjustments to account for specific temporal conditions, e.g., weekend vs. weekdays, rush vs. non-rush hours, season, and weather, as well as local spatial conditions, e.g., local traffic congestion, lane closures, or proximity to amenities or popular destinations. All these reasons hamper the implementation of travel time computations in spatial analytical models, since even local analytical models require the definition of a single rule for distance measurement. A crude solution to this problem is the use of average travel time in spatial models; a more realistic solution can be obtained through the use of Minkowski distance: an optimal value of Minkowski distance can be selected to model travel time on a complex road network.",

The procedure involves the percutaneous insertion of a catheter into the arterial system, after which it is guided into the aorta where the coronary arteries are positioned. Contrast dye is then injected into the coronary arteries so that blockages can be located and identified. In some instances, cardiac catheterization can lead to immediate use of percutaneous coronary intervention with balloon angioplasty and the insertion of coronary stents that open up partially or completely blocked arteries to restore blood flow. In some instances, this procedure is performed in stable patients where distance and travel times are a minor concern.

Latitude and longitude coordinates are then converted into Eastings and Northings, i.e., x and y values, expressed in kilometers. Alternative methods could have been used, for example the great circle distance formula [27], which, however, provides rougher estimations.

The lines connecting these locations indicate whether or not 2 close locations are considered neighbors and included in the estimation of spatial dependence. Other parameters contribute to the neighborhood definition: generally the most influential parameter is the number of nearest neighbors, complemented by a distance decay function and a weight [33]. Figure 5a shows the connectivity defined by the Euclidean metric, while Figure 5b corresponds to the Minkowski metric optimizing travel time (p = 1.31). A close comparison of the two plots (aided by the superimposed circles) reveals how the modification of the distance metric substantially alters the neighborhood configuration.",

Through the spatial weight matrix, the neighborhood configuration ultimately affects the variance of the model estimates, hence their reliability. As an example, Table 3 shows the variation in the parameter estimates and the regression diagnostics determined by the two alternative neighborhood configurations depicted in Figure 5. The regression model analyzes the socio-economic variables significantly associated with cardiac catheterization: the main predictors are family status, income, and educational attainments; the spatial distribution of these variables is used to identify areas of social and economic concern. This model thus provides an effective analytical tool to support policy decisions, providing guidance for the initiation of targeted, localized preventative health measures [32].",

All the independent variables benefit, in varying degrees, from the modified distance model. Likewise, the regression diagnostics indicate that the distance model does not appreciably affect the overall goodness of fit (represented by the pseudo-R2), but it does noticeably impact the autoregressive coefficient and, more importantly, the spatial dependence in the regression residuals.",

The Euclidean metric is the most common and intuitive measure of distance; Manhattan is another common distance measure, but very rarely does either of them provide a close approximation of an empirical road network, such as an urban network. Road distance, conversely, provides an accurate measurement, but it is prone to local features, and does not provide a single model of travel throughout the urban network. Travel time is, arguably, the most relevant estimate of distance, but its calculation introduces further specificities, as temporal anomalies are added to the local features, further reducing its generality. For these reasons, Minkowski distance is a promising solution: it provides a general model of travel throughout an empirical network; it possesses a large range of parameters, which enhance its flexibility; it can be easily calculated; and it can provide a less crude approximation of travel along a road network.",

Ideally, travel time provides the most accurate estimate of a patient's travel from their place of residence to a given health facility [15]. While accessibility studies may profitably employ this method, its use in spatial analytical models is inhibited by the particularity of its calculation, which tends to be heavily affected by local features, both in space and in time.",

Most importantly, it is limited to one class of distance metrics, i.e., Minkowski, whereas other metrics could be considered: Mahalanobis distance is just one example [34]. There are locational inaccuracies in the patient data [35] as well as in the road network; additional errors are likely to derive from the algorithm used for the distance calculations. Travel time calculations are based on assumptions, referred to as optimal conditions that tend to represent an ideal, but unlikely situation. The hypothesis of optimal conditions should be lifted, and more realistic conditions should be entered in the model, e.g., rush hour, or severe winter weather, and should be considered not just individually, but also jointly. An array of optimal Minkowski coefficients should consequently be calculated for the varying conditions, leading to the final identification of a stochastic optimum. The entire procedure is also based on the strong assumption of a single transportation mode: it can be argued that optimal conditions approximate ambulance travel, but the catheterization registry used in this analysis was not limited to patients who were transported directly from their residence to the tertiary catheterization facility. The APPROACH registry also includes patients initially admitted to hospitals or emergency facilities without catheterization facilities who were subsequently transferred to a tertiary center for this procedure under less urgent circumstances. Accuracy in travel route selection and in travel time estimates are most relevant to patients with more emergent cardiac conditions requiring rapid transportation from their residence to the catheterization facility. This limitation can be addressed by a twofold model, optimizing for ambulance and private vehicle travel. Still, road network travel is a reasonable assumption for urban environments, but is unlikely to be the sole mode of transportation to emergency care from rural and remote locations.",
