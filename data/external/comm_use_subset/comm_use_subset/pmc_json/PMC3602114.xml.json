Clinical assessment of disease activity, including laboratory tests, was carried out following the clinic routines. After the observation period, medical records were analyzed retrospectively to identify possible temporal associations, up to 30 days, between ARI/ILI episodes and signs of worsening of the underlying disease.

Episodes classified as ILI were more common in unvaccinated patients, but this difference was not maintained after adjusting for other covariates such as surveillance period, age, immunosuppressant use and active disease. We believe that the failure to maintain significance of IL1 episodes in vaccinated patients is related to the small sample size since we did not identify any specific covariate responsible to this failure when we performed the multiple model analysis. Thus, it is not possible to prove that the vaccine was really effective against influenza infections, as the pattern or seasonality of influenza infections seemed to be different between the two surveillance periods. However, it is important to state that during the follow-up period of six months after vaccination, none of the vaccinated patients had ILI episodes.",
