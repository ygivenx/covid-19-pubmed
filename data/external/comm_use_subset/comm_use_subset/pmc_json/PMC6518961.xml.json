            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged into Canada in January 2014, soon after the initial detection in the United States (1). The virus is highly contagious and is associated with mortality ranging between 80 and 100% in suckling pigs (2\u20134). Incursion of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has a large impact on animal health and profitability of individual farms; which can result in high loses for the entire swine-producing sector when a large outbreak occurs (4, 5). Despite this, PED is not considered a reportable disease at the federal level in Canada, similarly to other jurisdictions. Nonetheless, it is considered as provincially reportable in several Canadian provinces including Ontario (6). Both, legislative framework in the province of Ontario and concerns about the impact of this disease in the swine-producing sector supported establishment of several mechanisms of PEDV surveillance with different surveillance coverage (7). One of the surveillance mechanisms is based on the disease control program (DCP) database, which is known as the PED Ontario Area Regional Control and Elimination program (ARC&E). The DCP is based on swine producer volunteer participation and was implemented to monitor disease trends over time. The uniqueness of the DCP database is that it tracks the dates of the initial PEDV incursion, as well as the dates the herds declare freedom from infection from PEDV on the basis of established criteria. This allowed detailed estimation of incidence and prevalence over time in this source population (7). Briefly, the estimated prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the virus at the end of 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 4.36 (3.07, 5.99), 2.25 (1.49, 3.26), and 1.35 (0.79, 2.16), respectively (7). A decrease in prevalence, despite occurrence of new cases, has been achieved through implementation of targeted elimination programs at the individual herd level. Soon after PEDV emerged, veterinary practitioners developed approaches that allowed planned elimination of PEDV from swine herds. However, the time to elimination of the virus was premises-dependent and depended on the elimination strategy employed. For planning purposes, the time to PEDV elimination for specific herds could be projected on the basis of the herd type, its demographics, and infection control practices that are planned to be implemented. However, under field conditions, additional factors such as the demographics of the entire production system, the number of animal movements, availability of resources and the herd owners' overall willingness to eliminate a production-limiting disease could affect time to PEDV elimination for specific herds. Since the dates of disease incursion and elimination in individual herds are available, the DCP database could be an appropriate resource for evaluating the time to PEDV elimination under field conditions in the entire population (source population) participating in the DCP program. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine time to PEDV elimination in Ontario swine herds infected between 2014 and 2017, on the basis of records from the DCP database; and to identify factors associated with the likelihood of elimination.",

This DCP and database was initially created for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (8) and then was adapted to include PEDV when it emerged into Canada in 2014. The DCP is a voluntary program that collects diagnostic data including PEDV herd status of Ontario swine herds as outbreaks are reported, or as herds are classified as having eliminated PEDV from premises. The data collected from the participating herds include the premises identification number, herd type, herd size, date of enrollment into the database, PEDV status of premises on date of enrollment and the date(s) in which the premises changed their PEDV status to \u201cfree-from-PEDV.\u201d For a premises to be included in the current study the following inclusion criteria were fulfilled: (1) the premises participated in the DCP from January 2014 to October 2017, (2) the premises was located in Ontario, and (3) the PEDV infection status of the premises was available.",

Thus, the database contains herd (premises) infection status information i.e., whether a herd has eliminated the virus, whether any subsequent infection has occurred or any other changes in infection status, and the dates when the changes in infection status occurred. In the database, there are 4 types of premises infection status classifications: (1) confirmed positive, (2) presumed positive, (3) presumed negative and (4) confirmed negative. Premises that were classified as PED confirmed positive were premises that had confirmed positive real-time reverse, transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for PEDV at the Animal Health Laboratory (AHL) at the University of Guelph. A presumed positive status was declared based on pig flow and movement as identified by the premises' veterinarian and did not require any diagnostic testing. Thus, premises that housed animals that were sourced from a PED-positive premises were classified as presumed positive due to movement of presumed infected pigs. Presumed negative premises were previously positive premises (i.e., either previously confirmed or presumed positive), where the producer implemented measures to eliminate PEDV from the herd and confirmed the virus to be eliminated through animal or environmental testing. Sampling methods for classifying premises as presumed negative were based on herd type and pig flow, and considered different types of samples (i.e., individual swabs, Swiffer samples, oral fluids, etc). The basic considerations for all sampling types were: 98% individual test sensitivity, 100% individual test specificity, maximum design prevalence of 10%, and 95% confidence in detection of disease at the design prevalence level (9). Lastly, premises that were classified as confirmed PED negative were premises in which there were no clinical or diagnostic evidence of PED for at least 6 months after the presumed negative status update.",

In addition, one herd was excluded because the herd type was unknown and another herd was excluded because it was categorized as an isolation/acclimatization unit. Therefore, 138 confirmed or presumed PED-positive case herds were included in the study. A binary variable was created to indicate whether the case herds eliminated PEDV (censored = 1) off-site during the study duration and if the herds did not eliminate PEDV (censored = 0) during the study duration or due to loss-to-follow-up (censored = 0). For the case herds that did not report a change in the virus status over the study period of interest (n = 8), the herds were considered to be censored at times when their observation period ended. Similarly, there were cases (n = 14) that reported a change in infection status change that was >100 weeks (~2 years) after the initial date of infection. These herds were censored at 100 weeks. Consequently, a total of 22 herds had their time censored and 116 herds had the event of interest (i.e., reported to have eliminated the virus at least 10% level with 95% confidence).",

Thus, premises that were diagnosed in the summer and fall months were more likely than herds diagnosed in winter months (referent category) to eliminate PEDV.

This suggests that herds that were diagnosed with PEDV in 2015 were less likely to eliminate the virus compared to premises that were diagnosed in 2014 (referent category).

Newsletters, producer meetings and advertisements were communication tools that were used to inform producers of the risk of PED entry and to elaborate on prevention strategies (11). Following the initial emergence, the outbreak in the province of Ontario was well controlled, which was achieved through quick identification of the suspected source of outbreak and implementation of biosecurity practices aimed to prevent further spread of infection. This resulted in a relatively low prevalence of infected herds (7), which could have contributed to willingness to eliminate PEDV infection. Veterinarians have implemented site-specific elimination strategies in Ontario, however the duration of time for a premises to eliminate the virus is variable based on a multitude of factors (i.e., the initial start time for the elimination process may depend on the PEDV status of the sow herd, or the season). The starting time for the time to elimination in this study was not the start date of control measures aimed at elimination, but the date of original infection. In part, due to this reason, the median time to elimination was relatively long. However, we believe that this time to elimination gives veterinary authorities reasonable overview of time to elimination for a newly emerging disease in the area, for which previous experience in elimination did not exist.",

Additionally, most cases occurred during the first 2 years (n = 92 in 2014 and n = 27 in 2015) of the outbreak and it is possible that resources needed to be prioritized between actions needed to prevent further spread and actions to eliminate infection from already infected sites, particularly if such sites required substantial planning.

This was an expected finding, since in a farrow-to-wean operation; the system is generally less complex than a farrow-to-feeder or farrow-to-finish operation. For instance, farrow-to-wean herds have fewer types of production classes than farrow-to-finish herds. The presence of nursery pigs on the same site as suckling pigs complicates infection control practices since a separate set of control measures and operating procedures need to be designed and implemented for the nursery stage of production. This requires resources, strict adherence to internal biosecurity protocols and often demographic measures, such as creation of an interruption, or gap, in pig flow. Pig flow through a production system, and more specifically, the creation of a gap in pig flow, is now recognized as an essential aspect of achieving earlier farrowing site elimination by allowing more effective cleaning and disinfection protocols required for successful elimination (13). Pig flow through a production system is the frequency of introducing new pigs into a population and the amount of opportunity these pigs have to come in contact with other pigs. A gap in pig flow however is often a one-time event to prevent the entrance of new animals to control the spread of the virus. A partial depopulation could present a gap in pig flow, where infected animals are removed from the herd, followed by cleaning and decontaminating the site. The database did not include details about specific infection control practices, such as the details of pig flow or attempts to generate a gap in pig flow. Nonetheless, it is also worth pointing out that the variability in the time to elimination was markedly higher in farrow-to-feeder than in other herd types. It is possible that this time to elimination is not only driven by herd demographics and pig flow, but also with other factors such as willingness to eliminate, which was not directly measured in this study.",

Firstly, the DCP is based on voluntary participation. The Animal Health Act in Ontario required that all PED-positive herds report to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), by law, when the hazard was deemed emerging. The OMAFRA surveillance program only accounts for primary case herds, which are case herds with a positive diagnostic test (RT-PCR) for PEDV (14). Thus, secondary cases due to animal movement were not included in the OMAFRA surveillance program. Unlike the surveillance program managed by OMAFRA, where 100% coverage of primary PEDV-infected cases were included, the DCP used in the study only includes primary case herds that volunteered to participate in the program, and secondary cases resulting from animal movement from such cases (7).",

There were 14 premises for which the records indicated that the time between initial infection and a change in status to presumed negative was longer than 100 weeks. The survival time of these premises was censored at 100 weeks. Since participation in this large-scale disease monitoring program is not mandatory, it is possible that some of these premises were not working toward eliminating the virus, since there was no external pressure to do so. Alternatively, it is likely that owners that had a low prevalence of PEDV on-site, may have not tested pigs to confirm PEDV status (i.e., the absence from infection). However, both of these scenarios could occur with a production-limited disease. If large-scale disease control programs are initiated at the level that is different than a premises, or production-system level; veterinary authorities should be aware of the situations where time to negativity could take a long time. In addition, populations with high replacement and/or birth rates such as swine herds could have considerable number of susceptible animals introduced into a population that is partially immune due to recent exposure. This situation could provide opportunity for infectious agents to continue circulating at low levels. Consequently, declaring freedom from infection at 10% may not be sufficient. However, making a decision about the design prevalence should be weighed against the disease epidemiology and cost to producers. Another limitation is the database was missing variables for herd size. Due to this, the authors decided not to consider this variable in the analysis. However, despite these limitations, this study provided novel insight in regards to PEDV elimination times in Ontario.",

Under such assumptions, the median time to elimination of PEDV from Ontario swine herds varied between 23 weeks in nursery herds (standard error = 1 week), and 43 weeks (standard error = 17.5 weeks) in farrow-to-feeder herds. Herd type, season, and year of original diagnosis were all associated with the time to negativity (p < 0.05) in the multivariable model. Among the sow herds, farrow-to-wean herds had the highest hazard of PEDV elimination. These results are reflective of the complexity of the infection control practices applied in herds with different demographics and population structures. The hazard of elimination was also higher in herds that had the initial infection during summer and fall than in herds that had the initial infection during winter. This could be a reflection of seasonal variability in the pathogen transmissibility or decisions made at the level of individual herds to proceed with infection control measures when the likelihood of success is the highest. With the exception of the second year after initial emergence, the hazard of elimination increased over years, which could reflect the availability of resources to manage an emerging production-limiting disease. The median time to elimination was relatively long in all herd types. However, this could be a consequence of the way it was measured, the decisions about implementation of infection control measures which could be made at the level of individual herds, multi-site production systems or possibly delays related to reporting PEDV elimination. Nonetheless, the design of control measures for production-limiting diseases at the regional level should consider these factors.",
