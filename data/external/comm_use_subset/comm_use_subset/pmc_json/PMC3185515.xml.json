People acquire their first infection with HCoV-NL63 early in life [9], and during this first infection the chance to develop larynchotracheabronchitis (croup) is high [10]. With increasing age people experience repeated infections (unpublished findings LvdH), and in case of underlying disease an HCoV-NL63 infection can require hospitalization. On the whole we can say that within a few years a vast amount of data on this new virus has become available, except that the pathogenesis of HCoV-NL63 remains unknown. The lacking of an animal model system is the problem. In addition, an animal model system is needed to fulfill the Koch\u2019s postulates and link infection to a disease.",

It is of interest to investigate whether rhesus macaques can be infected by HCoV-NL63. This can either be investigated by direct inoculation of Rhesus Macaque with HCoV-NL63. Alternatively, one can establish whether rhesus macaques that are in close contact to humans have experienced a natural HCoV-NL63 infection by investigating the NL63-directed antibody titers in time.",

We have shown this for children who acquire their first HCoV-NL63 infection during their first years of life [9]. At later ages repeated infections with human coronaviruses can occur [14], depending on the levels of protective antibodies. Protective antibodies peak shortly after infection and gradually decrease during the following years, with accompanying susceptibility to a reinfection with time. In the current study we use the kinetics of the antibody response to HCoV-NL63 to determine whether rhesus macaques encounter natural infections with HCoV-NL63, or related coronaviruses. The serological assays were performed with the N-protein of HCoV-NL63 which is an immunodominant protein, although there is some homology with the N-protein of the closest relative of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E. To ascertain the most specificity, the C-terminal region (amino acids 215 to 377) of the protein \u2013 which has the most difference between NL63-N and 229E-N - was used. In addition competition experiments with homologous and heterologous proteins were included in each experiment to ascertain the specificity of an antibody response.",

The same samples did not have elevated levels of antibodies to HCoV-229E, indicative that the response was specific (data not shown).

These monkeys had been sampled on a regular basis, with on average one serum sample every one or two years. Sampling started when the macaques were already a few years old, except for one which was followed from 6 months of age. In all three animals a sudden rise in antibody titers was noticed (Figure 2, panel A, B and C). Rhesus macaque number 5 was followed from 1989 (starting at the age of 6 years) with high levels of NL63-directed antibodies. A strong peak was observed in 2003, indicating that the animal experienced an additional HCoV-NL63 infection (at 20 years of age). Animal number 10 started with low titers to HCoV-NL63 (age 2 years) but after some years very high titers to HCoV-NL63 were visible (age 8 years). Unexpectedly, these high antibody levels remained for the complete follow-up period (last sample collected at the age of 13). This is suggesting that the adaptive immune response to HCoV-NL63 is constantly activated, and one could speculate that this animal is experiencing a chronic HCoV-NL63 infection. Unfortunately, additional samples like throat swabs or faeces to test for chronic infections were not available. The third animal (number 17) was followed from early age on, starting with low levels of NL63-antibodies. Between the years 2003/2004 a steep rise in antibody levels was noted, whereas a second rise occurred after the winter of 2006/2007 (at 4 years and almost 7 years of age respectively). The animals were all checked for antibodies to HCoV-229E, but for none of the three monkeys reactivity was detected (Figure 2). This is in accordance with the first screening of the animals, which already showed low levels of HCoV-229E antibodies in these animals.",

However, one can conclude that it were infections with HCoV-NL63, or a virus which is serologically closely related. It can never be excluded that there is a coronavirus infecting these rhesus monkeys that is closely related to HCoV-NL63 (but has not been identified yet). Sampling of the respiratory tract on a regular basis throughout the years and eventually identify the pathogen that is eliciting the antibody response can answer this question, but is not an easy task. To our opinion the most likely explanation would be that natural infection with HCoV-NL63 occurs. The macaques described in this study live in a closed system with close contacts to humans (feeding, cleaning of cages, etc.). Through this contact they can encounter the virus as infections of humans with HCoV-NL63 occurs frequently in winter seasons [10]. As the cells of this monkey species are susceptible to infection (LLC-MK2 cells, a kidney epithelial cell line) it is very likely that in vivo infections can occur as well.",

Thus it can not be determined whether the seroconversion or reconversion to HCoV-NL63 was accompanied with minor clinical signs. Future studies should be designed to investigate viral infection with human viruses and the accompanying clinical signs to further unravel this subject. Here we show that it is not necessary to sacrifice monkeys by experimental infecting. A well-designed follow up through the years with serum and respiratory samples collected on a regular basis would be sufficient to unravel the potential of the human respiratory viruses to infect rhesus macaques. Once a cohort has set up and samples have been collected for a few years, all newly identified respiratory viruses can be screened with the appropriate serological assays, and infection related to clinical symptoms.",

It has been described that smallpox, measles, rubella or parainfluenzavirus 1 and 2 cause natural infection of Rhesus macaques and the closely related cynomolgus macaques [15,16]. Furthermore, experimental infection with several viruses showed that the animals are susceptible to various human respiratory viruses like respiratory syncytial virus and SARS coronavirus [17,18]. With the knowledge that natural infection of HCoV-NL63 is likely to occur, one should keep in mind that this has implications for animal model experiments. In case rhesus macaques are experimentally infected with HCoV-NL63 this might be a reinfection, in case the animal has encountered the virus previously, or the first infection, in case the animal is still young and was not naturally infected through human contact. The clinical signs during the first infection might be of a more severe nature in comparison with a recurrent infection. This should be taken into account in case a study is conducted to reveal the pathogenesis of the virus in an animal model system.",

Nowadays, with the recent epidemic of SARS-CoV, it is very difficult to attract volunteers for such studies. Not only has the public become aware of the potential dangers of a coronavirus infection, the recently identified viruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) have been isolated from children or adults with severe lower respiratory tract infection, and not simple common colds. Consequently, the only possibility to connect the recently identified coronaviruses to a certain disease is via associations with disease or animal experiments. To date no animal model system has been described for HCoV-NL63. Although all signs suggest that Rhesus macaques might be a good model system \u2013 since cells of Rhesus macaques can be in vitro infected by HCoV-NL63 \u2013 nobody has reported infection of these animals yet. We show here that there are clear signs that Rhesus macaques acquire natural infections with HCoV-NL63, or a serologically very closely related coronavirus. In future animal experiments to be carried out with Rhesus macaques the history of an animal should be known to determine whether the experimental infection occurs in an HCoV-NL63 na\u00efve animal or an animal that has encountered the virus during life, as clinical symptoms might differ greatly in first or recurrent infection.",
