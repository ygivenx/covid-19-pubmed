They also trigger several serious diseases in animals as causative agents. In particular, chicken anaemia virus (CAV), a member of family Anelloviridae genus Gyrovirus, is the etiological agent of chicken infectious anaemia [2]. CAV infects several bone marrow-derived cells which results in severe anaemia and immunosuppression in young chickens. In terms of older birds, CAV can jeopardize the immune responses [3, 4]. Since its first reported in 1979 [2], CAV infection has become epidemic among chicken populations on a global scale [5\u20137]. CAV also has dramatic financial impact in areas of intensive chicken farming. Vaccination is generally used to contain the spread of the virus [8]. In a recent study, a novel human gyrovirus was isolated from a skin swab and designated as human Gyrovirus (HGyV) [9]. Since Circovirus shares partial homology to CAV, the identification of HGyV signals possible threats for human pathogenesis, further investigation is yet required.",

VP1 is the major structural protein while the VP2 is a replicase with dual-specificity phosphatase activity [12].

Totally, we obtained 96 positive results for CAV infection in 722 clinical samples, 24 out of 149 in 2014, and 72 out of 573 in 2015. We analysed the infection type of CAV in association with other pathogens including Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV), reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), avian leukosis virus (ALV), avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2), and avian reovirus (ARV). We found that coinfection was the main infection type of CAV. In addition, we analysed the characteristics of the new CAV sequenced strains together with those available in GenBank. The analysis revealed that all the sequences could be clustered into four major groups. Furthermore, we compared the key amino acids in VP1 that determined the virulence of CAV, providing new insights into the epidemiology of CAV.",

The solution was oscillated for 3 min twice to break the tissues at a frequency of 29 Hz (MM400, Restch, Germany). Total DNA was extracted from the tissue homogenates using the AxyPrep Body Fluid Viral DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen, 15916KC5, USA), following the manufacturer instructions. The DNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water and stored at \u201270\u00b0C. Whole DNA was used as template for specific PCR with the CAV-specific primers, CAV-F and CAV-R [16], covering a 582-nucleotide region in the highly conserved overlapping sequence of VP2 and VP1. The PCR aplification was carried out using Premix Ex Taq (Version 2.0 plus dye, TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China), MgCl2, dNTPs, and 10 pmol each primer in a 20-\u03bcL total reaction volume. The reactions ran in an automated thermal cycler (Gene Amp PCR System TC-960F; Blue Marlin, Zurich, Switzerland) under the following program: initial denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 56\u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. In all PCR reactions, the CAV strain (Strain M9905)[17] previously isolated and identified in our laboratory was used as the positive control, and the PCR mixture was used as a negative control. The PCR products were analysed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and imaged using the BIO-RAD Universal Hood II system (USA).",

However, nine amino acids sites (22, 141, 151, 229, 254, 287, 294, 370, and 447) in VP1 had at least three substitutions each, while there was only one amino acid site (28) in VP2 and two amino acid sites (25 and 81) in VP3.",

Moreover, we analysed the sequences compared with the reported information that covered a more extensive strain distribution than ever before. Based on our investigation, a high positive rate (13.30%) of CAV was detected in sick chickens. Especially, the morbidity and mortality were considerably enhanced when chicks are dually infected with CAV and MDV, REV, or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), probably because of the virus-induced immunosuppression [29\u201333]. Talbe1 showed the infection type of samples collected in 2015, out of all the 72 CAV-positive samples, there were 35 (48.6%) samples were detected as MDV positive (18 dual infection; 15 triple infection; 2 quadruple infection), but other viral pathogens showed a similar ratio that was not particularly high, therefore, meaning MDV and CAV were the most common co-infection type in this investigation, as believed that outbreaks of MD in birds most are linked with CAV co-infection [34], which should arouse more attention. It is known that with CAV infected commercial chickens, lymphocytic depletion of the bursa often leads to lymphocytic depletion of the thymus [35, 36]. Therefore, in case of commercial flocks, immunosuppression by alternative viral agents, such as IBDV or MDV, is crucial in the outcome of CAV infection. Certain strains of reovirus can be immunosuppressive in chickens [37], which demonstrates the reovirus has strong link to the pathogenicity of CAV [37].",

With most of the variation in the VP1 coding region, generally less than 5% of limited genetic variation is known among isolates [3, 45\u201347]. In the case of predicted amino acid sequences, minor differences have been noted particularly in the VP1 amino acid sites 139\u2013151. The observed differences in the hypervariable region had impact on the predicted protein structure of VP1 [48\u201350]. In this study, the phylogenetic analysis of VP1 embodied the diversity of CAV, while the VP2 and VP3 embodied the conservatism. The non-structural VP2 protein probably acts as a scaffold protein during virion assembly, ensuring that VP1 folds correctly [51, 52], which can also induce apoptosis [53]. VP3, also known as apoptin [54]. Based on its ability to mediate cell death selectively in cells that have encounter an oncogenic transformation, VP3 has drawn a lot of attention [55, 56]. The localization of VP3 in infected cells are affected by presented threonine (T), which may be phosphorylated, at amino acid sites 20, 56, 61 and 114 [57]. In our study, we detected T residues in all the sequences, indicating conservatism that may contribute to the function of these two non-structural proteins and to the lifecycle of CAV.",

CAV strains are highly pathogenic if glutamine (Q) is present or less pathogenic if histidine (H) is present [6, 58, 59]. All the new isolates in this study had glutamine (Q) at amino acid site 394, indicating that all strains were highly pathogenic. At amino acid site 89, the attribution to the VP1 amino acid is due to the pathogenicity and monoclonal antibody reactivity differences between two molecularly cloned and highly passaged CAV strains [53]. The study of other mutations (I75, L125, E141, and E144) regarding attenuation has been reported. Renshwa et al. [40] proposed that Q139 and/or Q144 has influence on the rate of replication or dissemination of infection in MDCC-MSB1 cells. von B\u00fclow and Fuchs [55] stated the attenuation of Cux-1 was found after passages (P49) in cell culture. Whereas according to Todd et al. [56], Cux-1 became considerably less pathogenic at P173 in MDCC-MSB1 cells. As reported by Chowdhury et al. [52], two Malaysian CAV strains were partly attenuated at p6 and one was further attenuated at P123 in MDCC-MSB1 cells. Both 3-1P60 (AY040632) and SMSC-1P60 (AF390102) had substitutions M157 and S287. The characteristics of the critical amino acid residues in the VP1 from the new isolates in this study indicated that although almost all the strains were virulent, some had the features of low virulent or attenuated viruses. Therefore, in this study the CAV with low or attenuated virulent features were probably mixed as a contaminant in various vaccines [8], and recover their virulence in the host. Consequently, monitoring and improving the quality of vaccines may be a useful way to control the prevalence of CAV. Using high quality chicks and embryos (CAV-free) in the vaccines production process will be a good option. Furthermore, it is necessary to eliminate and replace the CAV positive chickens.",
