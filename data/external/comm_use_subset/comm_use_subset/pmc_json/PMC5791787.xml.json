I\u2019ve been investigating outbreaks for much of my career, but I first experienced the major public health impact of an emerging infectious diseases outbreak in 2003, when we had a large avian influenza (A) H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands and I was responsible for national laboratory preparedness and response. I realized how fast such events can develop, the difficulty of working with an unknown disease and the challenge of ensuring a coordinated response between veterinary and public health experts. We thought we were prepared, but it was not easy. Since then, I found similar challenges in the responses to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, a Marburg virus importation in 2008, other avian influenza virus outbreaks when the influenza (A) H5N1 viruses started to spread from China, and in the responses to Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Zika.",

We have well-established and reasonably funded networks and laboratories with defined roles and responsibilities for vaccine-preventable diseases, foodborne diseases, some blood-borne diseases and, increasingly, antimicrobial resistance. However, they are not set up for general emerging disease preparedness and response. Our disease\u2013specific response is unsustainable and unnecessary. A public health laboratory should be able to detect many diseases with the resources and manpower currently used for one disease, in collaboration with animal and environmental health experts \u2013 this is known as the One Health approach. This generic model should be our goal. My view \u2013 and that of many of my colleagues \u2013 is that we need a publicly-funded network of expert centres in all regions that work together on a routine basis, not just when there is an outbreak, each working on many emerging infectious diseases.",

But this mechanism wrongly assumes that contributing laboratories have funding for this response and lack only the means to invest in long-term capacity building. The ultimate goal should be to have sufficient regional capacity and links to centres of expertise around the world. That avoids the need for \u201cflying laboratories\u201d and, of course, this requires reliable and long-term funding for the whole network. Some government and other health funders have realized this need and have recently set up a new funding mechanism to develop vaccines for priority emerging infectious diseases: the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). We need something similar for generic preparedness.",

Research and the public health response need to be more closely linked as, for example, the EVD-LabNet in Europe for emerging viruses and laboratory preparedness, in which data is shared promptly.

The question of incentives is more complex than public health versus academia. There is no single solution, but several potential solutions. These include data sharing platforms that work within a code of conduct and that facilitate the sharing and use of data among a range of stakeholders for public health action, while retaining the right to publication or set out rules for use by the private sector. An example of such rules is that sharing needs to be immediate in the case of a public health emergency. We are working on such a platform through a collaborative group in Europe called Compare.",

On the other hand, we need private sector expertise to bring vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics to the market, if their economic interests are not protected, they may not be interested. So a middle ground needs to be found. The current emphasis on access and benefit sharing, as envisaged by the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources is a step forward. This agreement makes national authorities, not individual scientists or institutions, responsible for deciding what is shared and what is not shared. But not all countries are signed up to it and the Nagoya protocol was not developed with infectious diseases in mind.",

The project\u2019s priority list of about 10 emerging pathogens and the CEPI initiative to start developing vaccines for some priority diseases are good examples of such action. However, it is important to keep up the momentum, particularly for the practical side of preparedness and response. Global health security is as weak as the weakest links in the chain, so how do we build global disease preparedness and response capacity that combines diagnostic preparedness with the ability to support outbreak research? Currently, the development of laboratory capacity is a local or national responsibility. So here, again, the plea for a global, publicly-funded network of emerging infectious disease preparedness and response hubs. Such a project needs dedicated staff, equipment, facilities, data-sharing systems prepared during \u201cpeace time\u201d, so that they can be deployed during outbreaks. Given that many new diseases arise from our interaction with animals, a significant part of this network should be dedicated to regionally dispersed One Health centres of excellence. This project may seem expensive, but is not when compared to the economic costs of recent major outbreaks.",

This dilemma is not limited to low-income settings.

WHO relies on many partners for the outbreak response, but does not have a mechanism to fund those response activities.

Fortunately, the pandemic turned out to be milder than all the worst-case scenarios. But while a situation is evolving, you still have to decide on vaccine development for all scenarios.
