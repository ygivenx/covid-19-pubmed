Pioneering work by NGOs such as the ETC Group and headlines announcing the creation of artificial life have increasingly brought policy attention to bear on synthetic biology [13]. In April of 2012 the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity will consider the potential implications of synthetic biology as a new and emerging issue. Recommendations from SBSTTA will then go forward to the Eleventh meeting of the governing Conference of the Parties (COP11) in India in October 2012 for a decision.",

The emergence of these tools opens up data to allow researchers, policy makers and civil society to explore data for themselves, to raise their own questions and draw their own conclusions.

The choices made in the development of search strategies affect the number and nature of the results. Thus, searches of the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge capture a wide range of results across disciplines and publication sources but are very limited in terms of data fields for analysis. In contrast, Thomson Reuters Web of Science provides a narrower spectrum of results from three major scientific indexes and conference proceedings but includes all major data fields for analysis. We selected Web of Science because of the large range of fields available for text mining and analysis using software tools such as Vantage Point from Search Technology Inc. All databases suffer from lag times between the publication of articles and their appearance in databases.",

We engaged in experimentation with a range of search terms using corpus linguistics approaches and Natural Language Processing to identify individual words and phrases of relevance from samples of articles from Web of Science and reports on synthetic biology. This revealed that, in the absence of a controlled vocabulary, the terms used in synthetic biology such as biotechnology or protein engineering are rapidly swamped by uses of the same terms in other research areas. While it is tempting to use ever more refined terms we came to the conclusion that synthetic biology is a self-defining community of researchers from a variety of disciplines who are articulating themselves around the term synthetic biology and related terms such as synthetic genomics. For this reason a simple search strategy focusing on \u201csynthetic biology\u201d, \u201csynthetic genomics\u201d, \u201csynthetic genome\u201d and \u201csynthetic genomes\u201d was used to capture the core landscape. Other important contributions to the field are captured through analysis of cited literature and exploration of the landscape of researchers citing work in synthetic biology within their publications (below).",

The results were then imported into Vantage Point software from Search Technology Inc. for text mining and processing of geographical, institutional and funding data fields. Publications citing this core landscape were also selected in Web of Science to exclude self-citations, deduplicated and processed in Vantage Point. The processed data was then geocoded using Yahoo Place Finder and exported for visualisation and geographical mapping in Tableau Desktop and Gephi network mapping software. Data was prepared for display in Tableau Public by splitting relevant fields to extract values (i.e. country names). Gephi visualisations deployed the Fruchterman-Reingold and Force Atlas algorithms with nodes manually adjusted to ensure label clarity. The data presented in this article is limited to the literature available in Web of Science at the time searches were conducted in early January 2012. Data on literature citing the core landscape for synthetic biology is limited to the 5,995 deduplicated citing publications available in Web of Science at the time of search.",

A significant proportion of the literature takes the form of review articles with a provisional total of 62 review articles against 207 articles in 2011 (Figure 1). This profile of review against research articles suggests an emerging field.

The second class are informed by engineering and focus on extracting interchangeable parts from living systems to create construction units and devices that may or may not be analogous with existing biological systems (Benner and Sismour 2005: 553) Both classes focus on the chemical synthesis of biological components ranging from gene circuits to entire genomes.

These terms were then reduced to 24,023 multi-word phrases and composite terms (i.e. biotechnology, bionanotechnology) to focus on meaningful concepts and categories. The terms were then grouped using word stemming to capture variations of leading terms i.e. biological systems AND artificial biological systems or metabolic engineering AND metabolic pathway engineering. This method revealed that 356 terms capture 99% of records on synthetic biology. As we might expect, the top unifying term is synthetic biology. When synthetic biology was excluded the remaining 355 terms captured 88% of records providing sufficient accuracy for representation of the data. The 355 terms were then placed in a co-occurrence matrix that provides a quantitative measure of the number of records for each term (nodes) and the strength of connections between terms (edges). These relationships were then visualised using the open source Gephi network analysis software (Figure 2).",

Until recently, data on funding for scientific research was largely obscured in publication data. Web of Science now includes limited information on sources of funding. For synthetic biology data is limited to 562 records representing 44% of records in our dataset published from 2007. Furthermore, data is restricted to information in Web of Science, lacks standards of description, and does not provide an insight into the size of awards. However, it is possible to gain a partial insight into the nature of funding organizations and emerging networks of funding organizations. After cleaning the raw data we identified approximately 530 organizations as funding sources for synthetic biology. Figure 10 provides a visualisation of the top funding organizations that have supported research appearing in three or more publications in Web of Science.",

This type of information is rarely made visible and funding networks may not be visible to the agencies engaged in supporting research. We would emphasise that data on the funding network is limited to 44% of available records and further work is desirable to standardise funding data in future research. Furthermore, this data is unlikely to fully or adequately reflect private sector involvement. A fuller picture will be generated by ongoing work to map the patent landscape. However, the predominance of organizations funded by taxpayers within the scientific literature provides important potential levers for policy makers under the Convention on Biological Diversity seeking to promote respect for the letter and spirit of the Convention.",

Through the exploration of the core landscape of synthetic biology and its impacts within the wider scientific literature we have sought to contribute to the creation of a baseline for wider understanding and engagement with this emerging field. To achieve this objective we have exploited the increasing availability of digital tools for visualisation and interaction with scientific data to promote engagement with this field of research.",

As a contribution to debate on this issue we have established that the core landscape for synthetic biology involves 2,934 researchers from 682 organizations in 40 countries who are supported by a network of approximately 530 funding organizations. These researchers are engaged in work on genetic components, parts and organisms with potential for a wide range of applications. This community has demonstrated a considerable willingness to engage with civil society and policy and to consider appropriate measures for governance. However, at this early stage in the development of this field proposals regarding biocontainment and control remain under developed. In considering the introduction of a possible moratorium on field release Parties will be confronted by the challenge of balancing the fundamental importance of biodiversity to human welfare with recognition of the importance of the \u201cfreedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity\u201d as set out in Article 15.3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.",

Furthermore, we have argued that important opportunities exist for introducing appropriate governance measures through the development of guidance for funding bodies. Finally, the core contribution of this article has been to promote the development of longer term monitoring capacity. Taken together we believe that these proposals can help ensure that any action taken under the Convention is balanced and measured and does not unnecessarily impinge on positive developments in research while remaining attentive to the significant potential negative impacts of synthetic biology and the need to ensure they are objectively assessed and addressed.",
