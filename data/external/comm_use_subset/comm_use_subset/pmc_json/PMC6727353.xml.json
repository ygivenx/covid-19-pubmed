Six species of EBOV are known to date, named after the geographical region in which they were first isolated: Bundibugyo, Reston, Sudan, Ta\u00ef Forest (formerly C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire EBOV), Zaire and Bombali EBOV. Sudan, Ta\u00ef Forest, and Zaire EBOV are responsible for outbreaks in humans, whereas Reston EBOV infects non-human primates, and Bombali virus was recently discovered in bats [2, 3]. Fatal EBOV infections are characterized by rapid viral replication combined with an inadequate antiviral response. Hallmarks of fatal cases are immune suppression with T cells levels below the normal level, no CD8 T cell activation, delay of antibody response in the blood, and high viremia (1010 genome copies/ml serum). The EBOV pathogenesis starts with the subversion of both innate and adaptive immune response and the consequent induction of harmful inflammatory responses and tissue necrosis due to disseminated infections [4, 5].",

ScFvs, consisting of the VH and VL chain regions of a whole immunoglobulin (Ig), are the smaller portion still retaining the binding properties of the parental Ig. This format is ideal for genetic manipulation in order to obtain antibody constructs potentially useful for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [10]. Furthermore, scFv antibodies can be expressed inside the cell as intrabodies so as to bind to their intracellular target antigen [11]. The two main mechanisms underlying the efficacy of intrabodies are: 1) knockdown of the activity of cytosolic antigens through cytosolic intrabodies [12\u201314]; 2) diverting of antigens from their natural intracellular compartment by scFv binding due to an extra-signal for intracellular localization [15\u201317]. Intrabodies can be used to reveal the function of proteins by interfering with their function, although the possibility of targeting intracellular antigens gives them a therapeutic potential for a number of viral infections [18, 19], neurological diseases [20, 21] and cancers [12, 13, 22, 23].",

In the ETH-2 library which we used, the diversity (about 108 clones) has been introduced in the complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) of both the variable heavy chain (VH) and variable light chain (VL) domains [28]. To recover antigen-specific antibody phages, an aliquot of the ETH-2 antibody library containing 1012 cfu phage was used for the panning procedure as described elsewhere [29, 30]. In Fig. 1 soluble scFvs derived from IPTG-induced colonies were screened by ELISA to find those specific for the VP35 protein. All the E. coli colonies corresponding to the clones exhibiting an OD \u03bb value in ELISA higher than 0.079, were grown and subjected to DNA extraction and sequence analysis. Several clones had identical nucleotide sequences and five different clones, namely B10, A10, E1, F9 and H7, were identified; the amino acid composition of the complete sequences of the VH and VL domains is shown in Fig. 2 along with the schematic representation of a scFv gene in the phagemid cassette. The scFv reactivity towards VP35 was further characterized by ELISA (Fig. 3, panel a) and WB (Fig. 3, panel b) using VP35 recombinant antigen. The protein Glucose Oxidase (GO) and an anti-GO scFv for detection were used as negative controls. The anti-VP35 reactivity in ELISA was confirmed for all B10, A10, E1, F9 and H7 scFvs, while in WB the positivity was only observed for scFv A10, which reacted with a 37 kDa protein identified as the recombinant His-tagged VP35 protein also detected by the anti-His mAb. The scFvs B10, E1, F9, H7 recognized their antigen in ELISA but showed no reactivity in denaturing conditions of WB, suggesting that they probably recognize conformational epitopes. For its part, A10 is still reactive in WB and probably recognizes a linear epitope. The specificity of the anti-VP35 reactivity of B10, A10, E1, F9 and H7 scFvs is confirmed by the observation that they did not react with the irrelevant GO antigen either in ELISA or in WB (Fig. 3).\n\n\n",

However, the current Ebola outbreak, which started in May 2018 in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and has caused 1016 cases and 634 deaths to date [32], received only minor benefits from the use of new diagnostic assays, vaccines and drugs. The reason is that to control Ebola outbreaks, transversal coordination between health facilities and communities is essential to achieve rapid isolation of the cases of the disease and to stop the transmission chain. Detection of new cases at an early stage by rapid diagnostic tests and ring vaccination strategy with experimental vaccines on volunteers are therefore crucial for controlling EBOV in the current DRC outbreak [33].",

WB analysis showing the transient expression of the A10, H7, B10, F9 and E1 scFvs in CHO cells 72 h after transfection with the respective recombinant pTarget plasmids. Specific bands corresponding to scFvs (about 27 kDa) are detected for all clones; other bands of higher molecular mass are present in all the lanes and are a cross-reactivity as evidenced by their presence also in CHO control lane. Molecular mass of the marker is indicated. b Controls used in the luciferase reporter gene assay. The histogram shows the effect of transfection procedures on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter expression. Twenty-four hours after co-transfection with pGL IFN-\u03b2 luc and pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 EBOV wtVP35 expression vectors, cells were transfected with the ctrl anti-GO scFv pTarget. The next day, cells were additionally transfected with IAV vRNA. The results from four independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown as fold induction of stimulated samples with respect to unstimulated control. c.
