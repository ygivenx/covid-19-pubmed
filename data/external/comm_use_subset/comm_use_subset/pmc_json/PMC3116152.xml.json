            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most important causes of liver disease in humans. Although HBV infection is preventable by vaccination, it currently affects more than 350 million people worldwide, with many infected as long-term carriers [1]. HBV is a member of the Hepadnaviridae with a partially double stranded DNA genome of 3.2 kb in size [2]. The HBV nucleocapsid core is icosahedral and enveloped by a membrane containing the surface antigen glycoprotein (HBsAg). At the structural level, the nucleocapsid of the prototype HBV (genotype A) has been studied extensively by both cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography [2\u20134]. In addition to the presence of HBsAg, two other diagnostic markers can frequently be detected in the serum of infected patients: antibody directed against the core antigen (HBcAg, consisting of assembled capsids) and the e antigen (HBeAg) an alternate translation product of the core gene that is cleaved and secreted posttranslationally. The HBcAg is dimeric, and assembled cores exhibit oligomeric dimorphism: a proportion has T = 3 symmetry (with 180 subunits, consisting of 90 dimers of HBcAg) and the other proportion having T = 4 symmetry (240 subunits and 120 dimers) [5]. This icosahedral dimorphism is present both in cores that are purified from the serum of HBV-infected patients and in core-like particles which self-assemble upon in vitro expression of the core protein. When the HBV virion enters cells, the uncoated core is transported to the nucleus where HBV genomic DNA is repaired to the covalently closed circular DNA form. During replication, the RNA pregenome is incorporated into assembling cores, and reverse transcription to form the genomic DNA occurs within the assembled core [2]. The core protein dimers form spike-like protrusions which extend from the spherical surface of the core particle, and also form a network of pores or holes [2].",

            "text": "The presence of different genotypes of HBV has been correlated with different geographical regions and with varying severity of disease [6]. Recently, a novel genotype of HBV (HBV/G) was described [7], which has a unique 36- bp insertion downstream of the core gene start codon, resulting in a twelve amino acid insertion at the N-terminal end of the core protein. In addition, HBV/G has two stop codons in the precore region at positions 2 and 28, which prevent the expression of HBeAg [8]. The fact that HBV/G is almost exclusively detected in patients in association with one of the other seven HBV genotypes (usually HBV/A), and the frequent presence of HBeAg in HBV/G-infected individuals, suggests that HBV/G replication requires co-infection with a helper virus of another HBV genotype [9,10]. The unique epidemiological and clinical profile of HBV/G suggested that it could be deficient in some other aspects of its function, perhaps as a result of the differences in the capsid structure and function caused by the presence of the N-terminal insertion in the core protein. Although HBV/G has been shown to be capable of replication in the absence of another co-infecting genotype in vitro, the envelopment of genotype G appeared to be less efficient than that of genotype A, while the presence of the 36-nt insertion enhanced core protein expression and genome replication [9]. The aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the structural morphology of the HBV/G core particles in comparison with HBV/A, and in particular to localize the 12 amino acid insertion. We used cryo-electron microscopy and structural modelling to investigate structural differences in the features of HBV/G core-like particles that could influence functions such as replication, genome packaging, or possibly HBsAg envelopment of the capsid and viral secretion.",

Thus, we confirmed that the additional 12 N-terminal residues do not impair capsid formation. Furthermore, the insertion does not affect the basic structure of the core, other than presenting two additional regions of mass at the base of each of the spikes. Several groups have previously engineered N-terminal extensions to the HBcAg and found that this did not impair self-assembly of the expressed proteins into core-like particles [20,21]. The majority of the HBV/G cores had T = 4 morphology, as previously reported in expressed core\u2013like particles, and in cores isolated from patient specimens [22].",

The difference map created shows additional mass around the base of the spikes of the HBV core protomers (Figs 2c,d). When the difference map is superimposed with the HBV/A atomic coordinates the additional mass of the HBV/G structure is found to be adjacent to the N-terminal residues of the core protein (Fig. 2d and Figs 3a, b). The extra mass protrudes from the surface of the core particle and sits beside the capsid pores and not over them, so this feature would not effectively reduce the diffusive movement of nucleotide triphosphates into the core interior, or affect the release of nucleic acids from the core (Fig. 3a, b). When modelling the extra 12 residues by TASSER/COOT, it was apparent that there are a number of possible arrangements that 12 residues can take up and still be contained within the corresponding density (Fig. 3c). Previously, a crystal structure of an HBV capsid protein engineered with an additional 11 residue extension to its N-terminal end has been determined, PDB accession 2QIJ [21]. Although the orientation was different from that observed in HBV/G, both additional masses were pointing away from the four-helix bundle as opposed to interacting with the main body of the core protein (Fig. 3c).",

            "text": "The HBV capsid plays an important role in envelopment of the virion with membrane containing the HBsAg, which is a prerequisite for the secretion of viable progeny virions [2]. Amino acids in the core protein that are involved in envelopment competence, and which presumably make important contacts with the cytoplasmic domain of membrane-bound preS1 protein, have been mapped, both by mutagenesis [23\u201325] and by analysis of naturally occurring patient-derived HBV mutants that vary in their capacities to secrete mature virions [26\u201328]. There are thus 11 residues that have been shown to be essential for envelopment but were nonessential for capsid formation. A number of these 11 residues (shown in purple in Figs 3a, b) are found near the electron density made by the extra N-terminal insertion peptide of HBV/G (Fig. 3b). It is tempting to speculate that the 12 amino acid N-terminal insertion in HBV/G could be responsible for partially reducing the efficient envelopment of HBV/G, because of its proximity to several of these key residues that make contacts with the cytoplasmic domain of HBsAg. In particular, the N-terminal insertion partially covers several of these residues that were shown to be involved in secretion of mature particles, notably S17, F18, L60 and L95 (Fig. 3b) and thus might sterically hinder interactions between the L protein and core particle of HBV/G during envelopment. In addition, in previously published work, Hui et al. [20] showed that an insertion of 23 amino acids engineered on the N-terminal end of the HBV core protein could prevent core envelopment by membranes containing HBsAg. The additional N-terminal residues in HBV/G could interfere with one or more of the essential contacts that are important for core envelopment, leading to attenuated or partially deficient virion maturation. Our data show that the N-terminal insertion in the core of HBV/G partially covers the \u2018hydrophobic pocket\u2019 which contains the residues that are essential for normal virion secretion [22]. This pocket has been shown to undergo structural changes after envelopment, which may act as a trigger, to ensure that envelopment does not take place until after DNA second-strand synthesis has completed [22]. In HBV/G the N-terminal insertion might therefore also interfere with these structural changes, as well as sterically hindering key amino acids that are thought to interact with the envelope. A reduced ability for virion envelopment and secretion might partially explain why the presence of HBV/G in patients is strongly associated with co-infection by another genotype.",

In addition, the possibility of detecting specific antibodies directed against the insertion peptide in sera from patients infected with HBV/G could be explored.
