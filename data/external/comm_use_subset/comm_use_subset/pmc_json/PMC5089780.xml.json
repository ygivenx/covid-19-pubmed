The key elements of cellular actin polymerization machinery include, but are not limited to, actin, nucleation promoting factors (NPFs), and the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3). Arp2/3 was first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani [1] and consists of seven subunits, including Arp2, Arp3, P40/ARPC1 (P40), P34/ARPC2 (P34), P21/ARPC3 (P21), P20/ARPC4 (P20), and P16/ARPC5 (P16) (Reviewed in [2, 3]). Activated by NPFs, Arp2/3 initiates globular actin (G-actin) polymerization into filamentous actin (F-actin) (Reviewed in [4]). Under steady-state conditions, Arp2/3 and other actin polymerization elements are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. However, increasing evidence has shown that actin polymerization elements are also present in the nucleus and play important roles ranging from chromatin remodeling to transcription regulation (Reviewed in [5, 6]). The nuclear import mechanisms of actin and N-WASP, one of the best characterized NPFs, were previously determined [7\u201310], whereas nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling mechanism of Arp2/3 remains enigmatic.",

Alphabaculovirus is thus far the smallest pathogen known to profit from the host actin polymerization machinery for their propagation [21\u201323]. After the host cell entry of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), one of the best-characterized alphabaculoviruses, cellular Arp2/3 is activated by P78/83, a virus-encoded NPF [23]. In this way, P78/83 induces cytoplasmic actin polymerization to propel nucleocapsid migration towards the nucleus, where viral genome replication, gene transcription, and nucleocapsid assembly occur [21, 24]. However, unlike most pathogens that induce primarily cytoplasmic actin polymerization, AcMNPV also induces nuclear actin polymerization, which is essential for nucleocapsid assembly in the nucleus and for progeny nucleocapsid transport to the nuclear periphery [22, 23, 25\u201328]. The unique feature of nuclear actin polymerization induced by AcMNPV requires the accumulation of the cytoplasmic actin polymerization machinery, including Arp2/3, in the nucleus [27, 29\u201331], which makes this virus-infection system ideally suited as a research model for investigating the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling mechanism of Arp2/3.",

This complex interacts with several nucleoporins within the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and migrates across the NPC to the cytoplasm (Reviewed in [33]). After its nuclear export, RanGTP is hydrolyzed to RanGDP, and the complex releases the cargo protein to the cytosol.",

To investigate how AcMNPV accumulates Arp2/3, the central regulator of actin polymerization, in the nucleus, we cloned the cDNA sequences of Arp2/3 subunits from Sf9 cells, a commercially available Spodoptera frugiperda cell line commonly used for baculovirus infection (GenBank Accession: KJ187399.1, JQ364941.1, KJ187400.1, GU356595.1, KJ187401.1, KJ187402.1) [34]. Here, P40 was selected to represent Arp2/3 because P40 appeared to be the most abundant protein detected by either Western blot or fluorescence microscopy (Arp2 and P20 were less abundant than P40; Arp2 could only be detected by Western blot; other subunits were barely detected by Western blot or fluorescence microscopy when transiently expressed in Sf9 cells). We prepared plasmid-based expression constructs encoding P40 tagged with a V5 epitope (P40-V5) at its C-terminus or P40 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein at its N-terminus (EGFP-P40) to monitor the Arp2/3 dynamics during AcMNPV infection.",

The dynamic localization of P40 in AcMNPV-infected cells was monitored in the presence or absence of APH. Early during infection (0\u201312 hpi), P40 resided predominantly in the cytoplasm irrespective of APH treatment (Fig 1D). During the late phase of infection (After 12 hpi), AcMNPV infection resulted in detectable P40 accumulation in the nucleus in the absence of APH, suggesting that viral late gene products may play an important role in P40 nuclear accumulation. When the expression of viral late genes was shut off by APH, P40 failed to accumulate in the nucleus, as demonstrated by both immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation assays (Fig 1D). Together, these data indicated that viral late gene products are responsible for P40 nuclear accumulation.",

            "text": "Unlike most viruses, which primarily induce impaired protein nuclear import or enhance protein nuclear export, our results demonstrated that AcMNPV infection results in impaired protein nuclear export. As a nucleopolyhedrovirus, most AcMNPV replication processes, including viral genome replication, gene transcription, and nucleocapsid assembly, all occur in the nucleus. These processes require a variety of proteins, including, but not limited to, virus-encoded transcription factors, transcriptases, and capsid proteins, as well as some cellular proteins (e.g., actin, Arp2/3), to accumulate in the nucleus. AcMNPV contains 156 predicted ORFs at least 50 aa in length. Aside from a limited number of exceptions, the nuclear import mechanisms of most viral and cellular proteins during AcMNPV infection remain unknown. Currently, at least 7 exportins have been identified in eukaryotic cells [8, 32, 54\u201358]. Unlike other exportins that only transport highly specialized cargoes (Reviewer in [59]), CRM1 mediates the nuclear export of many NES-bearing proteins, and its dysfunction leads to the nuclear accumulation of these proteins. Based on bioinformatics prediction (NetNES, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNES/) [60], 98 AcMNPV proteins contain putative residues that could serve as a NES (S2 Table). Such a high percentage of viral proteins bearing putative NESs implies that CRM1-dependent nuclear export may determine the subcellular distribution of many viral proteins, and the inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export by Ac34 could possibly play a key role in the AcMNPV-induced nuclear accumulation of proteins. Whether Ac34 also influences other exportins or these exportins also contribute to the virus-induced protein nuclear accumulation remain to be explored.",

Alphabaculoviruses and betabaculoviruses behave in significantly different ways. In respect to cytopathology, alphabaculoviruses assemble their nucleocapsid in the nucleus, whereas betabaculoviruses induce nuclear membrane rupture, and nucleocapsid assembly occurs in a combination of the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm [62]. This cytopathologic difference suggests that unlike alphabaculoviruses, betabaculoviruses do not need to accumulate the cytoplasmic actin polymerization machinery to the nucleus. As a consequence, betabaculoviruses do not need a viral protein or mechanism to induce nuclear accumulation of Arp2/3 (although only P40 and P20 were proved to be retained in the nucleus of AcMNPV-infected cells in this study, both Arp2/3 components behave in a similar way upon virus infection), which is supported by the evidence that Ac34 homologues are absent in the genomes of betabaculoviruses [61].",

            "text": "Nuclear G-actin is required for the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerases [63\u201365] and the epigenetic activation of chromatin (Reviewed in [5, 66]). Among the three key actin polymerization elements that are accumulated in the nucleus during AcMNPV infection, only G-actin is recruited to the nucleus by early viral gene products [29, 30]. This early nuclear accumulation of G-actin could increase the nuclear G-actin pool and promote the transcription of viral early genes that are transcribed by host RNA polymerase II [61]. Late in infection, P78/83 and Arp2/3 accumulate in the nucleus and induce nuclear actin polymerization that converts G-actin to F-actin. The resulting nuclear G-actin pool depletion could lead to the loss of the transcriptional activity of host RNA polymerases and the epigenetic reprogramming of host chromatin towards transcriptional inhibition, which could contribute to the host gene transcription shutoff that occurs in the late phase of baculovirus infection [67, 68]. Consistent with this, cytochalasin D, a chemical that specifically prevents actin polymerization, behaves as an antagonist of the virus-induced shutdown of host gene expression [69]. In this respect, nuclear actin polymerization induced by baculovirus infection may also participate in the regulation of host/virus gene expression by the modulation of the nuclear G-actin pool, in addition to its role in assisting viral nucleocapsid assembly and transport, which has long been recognized.",
