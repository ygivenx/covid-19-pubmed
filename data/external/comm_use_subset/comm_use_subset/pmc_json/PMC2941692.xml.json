Our model framework is flexible and adaptable to handle new more precise structural information as details emerge about the genome's physical arrangement.

Genome-wide histone modifications are being studied through a combination of DNA microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip assays) [20].

The ENCODE initiative [21] is creating high-resolution epigenetic information for ~1% of the human genome. Despite the fact that such modification occurs in histone proteins, current approaches to map and visualize such information are limited to sequence coordinates in the genome. Our physical genome model visualizes methylation of histone proteins at atomic detail as determined by crystal structure. Figure 2C shows histone methylations for several histones within an ENCODE region. An integrated physical genome model can show the interplay between histone modifications and other genomic data, such as SNPs, DNA methylation, the structure of gene, promoter and transcription machinery, etc.",

This may identify genes that have P53 binding sites in their promoter regions and are responsive to the dosing effect of P53 protein. Such large-scale microarray expression data is often displayed with a two-dimensional array format, emphasizing shared expression between genes, while P53 binding data are stored in tabular form. With a physical model, expression levels of genes in response to P53 level can be mapped to genome positions together with global P53 binding information, revealing any structural bias of the expression. Figure 3 shows this type of physical genome annotation. Drawing inferences from coupling averaged or \"snap-shot\" expression data with the dynamic architecture of the genome may be helpful in determining structural dependences in expression patterns.",

This basic model is approximate since precise knowledge of the physical genome is largely unknown at present. However, the model's inaccuracies are secondary to its multi-scale approach that provides a framework to improve and refine the model. Current technologies are making significant progress toward capturing chromosome conformation within the nucleus at various scales [24,25]. Because our multi-scale model is purely descriptive beyond the NCP scale, it can easily incorporate more accurate structural folding information, such as the 'fractal globule' behaviour [26]. The Genome3D viewer, decoupled from the genome model, can be used to view any model that uses our model framework.",

The structure and organization at a physical level is dynamic and heavily influenced by local and global constraints. A typical experiment may provide new data at a specific resolution or portion of the genome, and the integration of these data with other information to flesh out a multi-resolution model is challenging. For example, an experiment may measure local chromatin structure around a transcription site. This structure can be expressed as a collection of DNA strands, NCPs, and perhaps lower resolution 30 nm chromatin fibers. Our data formats are flexible enough to allow partial integration of this information, when the larger global structure is undetermined, or inferred by more global stochastic measurements from other experiments. Combining such data across resolutions is often difficult, but establishing data formats and visualization tools provide a framework that may simplify the integration process.",
