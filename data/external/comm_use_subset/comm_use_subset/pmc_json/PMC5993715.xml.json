FP suppressed lung NF\u03baB p65 activation in RV-infected mice at 8 h post infection (Fig. 1c).

IFN signalling via IFNAR induces phosphorylation of STAT1/2. Therefore, to further confirm this finding, immunodetection of STAT1 phosphorylated at Y701 (pY701) and STAT2 phosphorylated at Y690 (pY690) was investigated in BEAS-2B cells stimulated with recombinant IFN-\u03b2. FP had no effect on IFN-\u03b2 induction of either STAT1 or STAT2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3h). We additionally confirmed these in vitro findings by demonstrating that FP administration had no effect on lung ISG induction following recombinant IFN-\u03b2 administration in mice (Fig. 3i).",

These data extend observations from previous studies which reported suppressed IFN responses to virus infection associated with corticosteroid administration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells15, fibroblasts16 and airway epithelial cells16,27. An intact type I IFN response is important for effective lung virus control and we have previously reported that IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit increased virus loads when infected with RV20. In addition to showing impaired ex vivo IFN responses1,8,28, patients with COPD experimentally infected with RV have increased airway virus loads compared to controls without airway obstruction1,29, thereby indicating that IFN responses are also an important determinant of virus control in man. Our finding that FP administration in the mouse model delayed virus clearance in vivo is supported by human studies that have reported increased viral titres associated with systemic corticosteroid administration during RV challenged healthy subjects30 and increased RV shedding with intranasal FP administration during naturally occurring colds31, although conflicting data exists with another study showing only a trend towards increased virus shedding following combined treatment with oral and intranasal corticosteroid during experimental RV challenge32. Although the effect sizes observed in our mouse model were relatively small, we observe delayed virus clearance in an animal model where limited replication occurs33. In human RV infection, where replication is more robust and of longer duration1, ICS may be expected to have even more pronounced effects. However, we acknowledge that the mouse model of lung RV infection does not accurately model the sustained nasal viral replication seen in man. This restriction in viral replication means that our in vivo data showing ICS-mediated increase in virus loads should be interpreted with caution and further conclusive evidence on the effects of ICS on virus replication is required using ICS administration during experimental virus challenge in COPD patients.",

            "text": "We additionally identified which components of viral RNA recognition and/or IFNAR signalling pathways were disrupted by ICS using in vitro methods with specific PRR-activating viral RNA surrogates. In the experimental approach used, FP administration had no effect on ISG expression nor STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, following stimulation with recombinant IFN-\u03b2, thereby suggesting that inhibitory effects of FP may be confined to initial virus-sensing pathways and not through effects on autocrine amplification via IFNAR. We have previously shown that induction of IFN by RV infection occurs initially via the endosomal PRR TLR3 and later via the inducible cytoplasmic helicases RIG-I and MDA-523. In the current study, FP suppressed TLR3-mediated IFN expression, suggesting that corticosteroid inhibition of IFN production occurs through an early effect on the initial endosomal sensing of RVs. In keeping with this finding, we observed that FP suppressed IFN\u03b2 promoter activity induced by TRIF, the adaptor molecule utilised by TLR3 to stimulate type I IFN expression. We additionally evaluated the effect of FP administration on stimulation of airway epithelial cells by agonists for the cytosolic PRRs downstream of TLR3 and surprisingly found a differential effect with suppression of RIG-I-induced, but no effect on MDA-5-induced, IFN expression. Additionally, FP suppressed IFN\u03b2 promoter activity induced by MAVS, the adaptor molecule that is utilised by both MDA-5 and RIG-I to stimulate IFN expression. The reason for the discrepancy between the effect of FP on pathways mediated by the cytoplasmic receptors RIG-I and MDA-5 (which share many similarities) is unclear. It is possible that differences exist between how the adaptor molecule MAVS is utilised by MDA-5 and RIG-I to stimulate IFN production. Nonetheless, our data suggest that FP may exert its inhibitory effects on IFN induction through inhibition of the TLR3 virus-sensing pathway. This is consistent with a study which reported that FP suppressed poly(I:C) induction of CXCL10/IP-10 in BEAS-2B cells34. However, it should be noted that, although the selectivity of agonists used is supported by previous studies35,36, we cannot exclude that ligands employed in our studies do not trigger additional PRRs to those stated. Further evidence that ICS affect IFN signalling was shown in our mouse model, where FP administration suppressed activation of lung IRF-3, a signalling intermediate of the innate response. However, it should be noted that any nuclei obtained using our methods will be from multiple cell types, so it is possible that these data may be explained by effects of ICS on cellular composition.",

RV infections can stimulate mucus production from airway epithelium and thereby potentiate sputum production during acute exacerbations45,46 and our finding that FP administration diminishes control of RV infection leading to increased mucin expression further suggests that use of these therapies may worsen mucus hypersecretion, leading to enhanced and/or prolonged symptoms and delayed recovery from exacerbation.",

Based on this perceived risk, some clinicians are now questioning the uncritical use of these widely prescribed therapies in COPD with ongoing evidence of practice change48. Remarkably, an underlying mechanism for this effect has never been identified. We have previously reported that experimental RV challenge induces secondary bacterial infection in COPD, through virus-induced suppression of the AMPs SLPI and elafin14. In the current studies, in addition to suppression of IFN, FP also suppressed RV induction of a number of airway antibacterial responses, including SLPI, accompanied by increases in bacterial load. Recombinant IFN-\u00df administration reversed suppression of SLPI and reduced increased bacterial loads associated with FP administration without affecting suppression of other antibacterial responses. Combined, these data suggest that FP may potentially increase risk of virus-induced secondary bacterial pneumonia through suppression of SLPI and that recombinant IFN therapy may prevent increased bacterial loads following RV infection. We speculate that this could be one mechanism explaining the increased pneumonia risk associated with ICS use in COPD9,13 and is consistent with previous data showing that higher RV loads are associated with increased risk of secondary bacterial infection in COPD14 and that ICS-related pneumonia episodes typically follow protracted symptomatic exacerbations12.",

During virus infection, we clearly demonstrate in a range of models that FP has a suppressive effect on airway SLPI production. Since STAT1 has previously been shown to regulate SLPI expression52, FP likely impairs SLPI production during RV infection by suppressing PRR-induced IFN production thereby reducing subsequent IFNAR-mediated STAT1 activation. This mechanism is supported by our finding that IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice also had reduced RV induction of SLPI. Additional evidence for the importance of deficient SLPI being an important mechanism for bacterial infection in COPD is provided by studies that have shown reduced airway SLPI in frequent (notably, of whom a greater proportion was taking ICS) versus infrequent COPD exacerbators53 and in patients with positive bacterial culture at exacerbation54,55.",

Evaluation of whether these detrimental effects occur in COPD is important because COPD is reported to be a relatively steroid-resistant disease58 and therefore it is feasible that steroid-induced adverse effects may not be observed in this context. In primary COPD AECs, FP suppressed RV induction of IFN responses and also enhanced mucus production. We confirmed these findings in vivo using a mouse model of COPD exacerbation25, to similarly demonstrate that FP suppresses RV-induced IFN responses leading to delayed virus clearance and mucus hypersecretion in vivo. Thus, FP administration in both in vitro and in vivo COPD models was associated with suppressed IFN responses, confirming that these adverse effects still occur in steroid-resistant disease models, and the increased virus load and mucus production observed in vivo could impact adversely on exacerbation severity. The elastase mouse model of COPD reproduces many of the immunopathological features of human COPD exacerbation25, but it is well recognised that existing models cannot completely recapitulate the complexities of human COPD, which occurs in genetically susceptible individuals following prolonged cigarette smoke exposure. Elastase administration represents a synthetic model of COPD and further animal studies using alternative modelling approaches, such as smoke exposure or genetic manipulation, are required to confirm our findings.",
