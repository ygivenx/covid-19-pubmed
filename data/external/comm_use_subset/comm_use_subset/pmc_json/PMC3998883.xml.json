            "text": "One of the principal challenges in managing emerging epidemics is to predict the likely future development of disease in order to assess the severity of the invasion prior to instituting control measures. However, prediction is difficult when little is known about how a new pathogen is likely to continue to spread in an alien environment, and frequently the underlying epidemiological parameters that influence the spread of disease are not known. Even when there is prior knowledge of a pathogen, as for example foot and mouth epidemics in the UK in 1967, 1982 and 2001, different pathogen strains, changes in farming practices or environmental conditions can markedly change the extent and speed of disease spread through the landscape [7], [9], [22], [23]. Whereas, for example, the spread of foot and mouth disease in the 1967 epidemic was relatively localised, occurring mainly by aerial dispersal [24], changes in the frequency and distance of livestock movements over large distances [25] led to a strikingly, topologically different epidemic in 2001 [7], [9]. Numerous other examples have been reported of variability in epidemic outcome upon reintroductions of emerging pathogens. This is problematic, because rapid decisions about the introduction of disease control strategies often have to be made early in the course of an emerging epidemic. Sometimes, options are clear. Immediate control aimed at eradication is initiated as soon as an outbreak is detected for certain statutory diseases. Actions against the H1N1-2009 pandemic influenza worldwide [26], foot and mouth disease in the UK [8], and Asian soya bean rust in several US states [27] are good examples amongst others of human, livestock and crop diseases that attract an immediate response.",

Informed decision making invokes a series of questions about how to make inferences about the emerging epidemic: what type of epidemiological model can be used to characterise the epidemic and to predict future spread of disease? Where are the susceptible hosts and how are they distributed in the landscape? How is disease transmitted and what are the values of the epidemiological parameters for transmission and dispersal? How soon during the course of the epidemic can the parameters be reliably estimated? How should we take account of uncertainty? Here, we examine these questions using a combination of Bayesian statistical inference and a unique, spatially- and temporally-resolved data-set [28] for the invasion of a plant disease, Asiatic citrus canker, in Florida.",

The pathogen can infect a very wide range of citrus and related hosts, causing defoliation, fruit blemishing and severe losses in quality and quantity of yield [29]. The pathogen is principally spread by wind-blown rain [29], [30]. It is not vector borne, other than by anthropomorphic transmission on machinery [29], but the spread is known to be exacerbated by leaf damage inflicted by the Asian leaf miner Phyllocnistis citrella that first appeared in Florida in 1993. There have been several independent introductions of Xac into Florida up until the mid 1990s [31]. The pathogen was originally introduced on imported seedlings from Japan in 1910 and declared eradicated, after extensive removal of infected and exposed susceptible trees, in 1933. An outbreak in Manatee county on the west coast of Florida was thought to have been eradicated in the 1980s, but ACC reoccurred within two years from surviving inoculum. A new infestation of ACC from a genetically different strain of Xac was reported in urban Miami on residential trees in 1995. The disease spread rapidly through Eastern and central Florida [29], triggering an extensive eradication programme, involving compulsory removal of \u223c7M commercial, >4M nursery and 0.8M residential trees around infected sites, at a cost of >$1 billion. The eradication scheme was halted in 2006 following widespread dispersal of inoculum during several severe hurricanes in 2004 and the eventual determination that the disease had become endemic rendering eradication unattainable [32].",

Accordingly, the USDA Agricultural Research Service initiated a detailed census of susceptible trees and the occurrence of ACC in five sites in Broward and Dade counties in the Miami region. The sites ranged from 2.6 km2 to 15.5 km2\n[28]. The data provide a full census of susceptible trees, with 24 successive monthly snapshots for the occurrence of new infections.

The spatial locations of susceptible citrus trees in the four sites were fully enumerated using a differential global positioning system. There were 4730, 1113, 6056 and 6072 trees at sites B1, B2, D1 and D2, respectively. Each site was visited by teams of inspectors at successive intervals between October 1997 and October 1999. The locations of infected trees were identified and notional infection times were calculated by experienced personnel, from lesion size and other phenotypic characters. In order to account for errors in the assessment, the notional times were then grouped into 24 successive 30-day intervals (effectively used as censoring intervals for the true infection times). The data therefore provide spatial snapshots of the locations of susceptible and infected trees at successive 30-day intervals (see examples in Figures 1B,C). The incidence of disease increased rapidly at all sites during the first 18 intervals with little infection thereafter coincident with the onset of dry conditions (Figure 1D). Further details of the collection of data are given in [28]. Disease was present in the area surrounding the census sites during the outbreak, with both susceptible and infected citrus trees between the sites (Figure 1A; see Figure S10 for a density map of citrus trees in the area). The data for an isolated small fifth site, also enumerated by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the USDA, with a very small spread of infection around a single focus of three trees, are not analysed here because the small size of the outbreak precluded rigorous analysis. The effects of ingress of inoculum from infected trees outside the sites were incorporated into the rates for primary infection. Hence, for the purposes of the analyses, in this paper each site was treated as an independent sub-population subject to external inoculum, and parameters were assumed to be independent among sites.",

In contrast with the case of \u03b1, there was also a trend in the posteriors for \u03b2 to decrease as time progressed. The trend in \u03b2 is more appropriately characterised by the sliding windows (Figure 2E), in which estimates are averaged over successive but overlapping six 30-day intervals (cf. model  in Table 1, with \u0394T = 6 months). Similar results were obtained for \u03b5 (Figures 2C,F), suggesting that both forms of transmission were driven by environmental variables.

There is a striking correspondence of magnitudes and trends in  between the two Broward sites (Figure 4A), which are located close to each other (cf. Figure 1A). The more distant Dade sites (Figure 4B) are themselves more distantly separated than the Broward sites (cf. Figure 1A) and show at first a less consistent pattern (see Figure S8). However, if we allow for a 1-month lag in the rates between D1 and D2, the two series of estimates display again a strong correlation (Figure 4B). Such a time lag would be consistent with delayed introduction of the pathogen or the vector, but awaits further analysis and testing. Similar, yet more regular patterns at all four sites emerge when comparing estimates at resolution \u0394T = 6 months (see Figure S9).",

Simulated disease progress curves are able to reproduce on average the observed epidemic progress (Figures 5A,C,F,I). The spatial autocorrelation function calculated at the end of each interval,  (Equation 5) is shown in Figures 5B,D,G,J. Predictive distributions of  (gray shaded areas) agree well with the autocorrelation estimated from experimental data (thick red lines). Some deviations emerge for the intervals [6], [12] and [9], [15] months (Figures 5G,J), where the experimental function appears to decay faster than the simulated function between 100 m and 250 m (Figure 5G) and 200 m and 600 m (Figure 5J), respectively. The spatial structure of the hosts infected at the beginning of the window (time ) can significantly bias the values of : such an effect emerges at short distances in Figure 5J, as the value 0 lies out of the 95% significance interval for  (dashed cyan lines). A statistic free from this bias is the time-lagged function  (Equation 6, Figures 5E,H,K), which measures the excess of newly infected trees at time  at distance  from the trees already infected at . Significance intervals (dashed cyan lines) are always distributed around 0. Predictive distributions of  (gray shaded areas) are in very good agreement with  from observational data (thick solid red lines), except again for the interval [9], [15] months (Figure 5K; for a possible origin of the disagreement see Text S1 and Figure S5). Overall, the spatial pattern of the epidemic is broadly well reproduced by the model estimates. We remark (cf. the beginning of this section) that very similar results were found for a model with Cauchy kernel (not shown here). Deviations appear when using different dispersal kernels (considered at the preliminary stage, see Methods), and extreme discrepancies with the data arise when testing models without primary infection (an example is given in Figure S7).",

While very early predictions (Figure 6B1) slightly under-estimate disease (with a very large credible interval), including more snapshots for estimation leads to consistent improvement of the forecast (Figures 6B2,B3). Hence, information about a single parameter, \u03c9, leads to a stark improvement of disease prediction. We remark, however, that it was not possible to identify a single, clear environmental factor responsible for the overall decreasing trend of the time series (henceforth, we refer to the monthly series only, cf.

Predictions based on the first three months (Figure 6C1, with corresponding estimates for \u03b2t in Figure 6D1) capture the future progress of disease, with a smaller credible interval than for scenarios A and B (cf. Figures 6A1, B1). Increasing the observation window to six and nine snapshots does not have a significant effect on forecast (Figures 6C2\u2013C3), as most of the additional true values of \u03b2t (orange circles starting from month 4 in Figures 6D2\u2013D3) are already well imputed from the first three months (cf. corresponding times in Figure 6D1, dark red line). We conclude that knowledge of the peak values of \u03b2t, supplemented by a few early stage observations, provide enough information to predict the future course of the epidemic. Among the different scenarios we investigated (including several not discussed here), we found scenario C to correspond to the minimal amount of extra information that could produce reliable predictions from the early stages.",

How reliable are future predictions of the epidemic severity? Does the epidemic merit the deployment of control, and how should this be optimised? Here we have focused on the first two questions about estimation and prediction, using a combination of Bayesian statistical inference and data for the spread of citrus canker in urban Miami. We assumed that little was known about the pathogen, using non-informative priors for the parameters and a selection of dispersal kernels. Our analyses have shown that the same spatio-temporal, stochastic model is able to capture the temporal trends and spatial statistics characterising the spread of infection in all four sites. Pathogen spread within sites is described by an exponential dispersal kernel with a time-varying transmission rate augmented by a small, time-varying rate of external infection. We show, therefore, that epidemics were not self-contained within sites but new foci of infection also arose from external inoculum, a phenomenon evident at all four sites.",

Table S1 and Text S1). Table S1 shows no significant differences between the exponential and Cauchy models, except for site D1, for which the exponential model is favoured. For the other census sites, the two models are essentially equivalent. This result can be explained in two steps, first by analysing dispersal at short distances (Figure 7), then by considering the contribution of external infection at longer distances (Figure S1). Figure 7 shows a direct comparison of estimated exponential and Cauchy kernels, plotted as a function of distance for each census site. The pattern is qualitatively similar for all census sites: the two kernels are substantially identical up to distances of a few hundred metres (\u201cplus\u201d signs in Figure 7): 250\u2013300 m for all the sites bar D1, and \u223c150 m for site D1 (Figure 7C: this may be a reason why the DIC tests favours the exponential kernel for this site). Beyond those distances, which correspond to a fraction of the size of the census site (1 km\u20134 km), the relative difference between the two kernels increases rapidly. Hence, in principle it should still be possible to detect the effect of such difference in estimates from spatio-temporal maps of disease. However, the long-distance divergence between the two kernels is balanced by the primary infection rate \u03b5. This is shown with an illustrative example in Figure S1 (see also Text S1 for details), where exponential and Cauchy kernels are used to generate spatial maps of the infectious pressure from a given experimental snapshot of site D2 (Figure S1(A)). When only secondary infection is considered, clear differences between the two kernels emerge at long distances (Figures S1(B\u2013C)), but the differences disappear, yielding virtually identical maps, when adding the effect of the external infection rate \u03b5 (Figures S1(D\u2013E)). We draw the following conclusion: that the scale of our observations is too small to choose unambiguously between the two dispersal kernels, as the potential effect of long-range dispersal within a census site is confounded by the presence of external infection. Gottwald et al.\n[53] found that a power law dispersal model was superior to an exponential model for the spread of ACC in 203 citrus plots in Brazil, following the introduction of the leaf miner. In the absence of the leaf miner, however, dispersal of ACC was adequately described by an exponential model, which is in agreement with our findings; moreover, none of the models considered in [53] included external infection.",

The choice of an exponential kernel for early estimations (Figure 2) would then be motivated by a strong prior belief on disease dispersal (for example, from results in the absence of the leaf miner in [53]). Here, we also note that, in our case, the absence of such a prior belief would be of little importance, as the exact form of the kernel would not affect the main results of Figure 2. Of the several kernels tried for the first few snapshots, most (e.g. the Gaussian, Text S1) produced estimates of dispersal scale and infection rates with patterns in time qualitatively very similar to those in Figure 2 (results not shown here).",

For our dataset, we have identified a short initial transient period at all four sites for which \u03b1 and \u03b2 are not well estimated, with comparatively wider posterior distributions than for later assessments. Clearly, relying upon data for the first three 30-d intervals leads to great uncertainty in estimates of the dispersal scale, and hence decisions about the scale of control (Figure 2). The use of sliding windows shows that fewer but later snapshots could be as precise in estimating dispersal parameters (measured by posterior distributions) as cumulative windows with more snapshots (Figures 2A,D). Estimates for the dispersal parameter changed very little over time (Figure 2D): this motivated consideration of a new, simpler model where dispersal was constant throughout the epidemic (, Table 1). The robustness of the results for the dispersal scale was confirmed by goodness of fit tests, in which the posterior predictive distribution of several test statistics showed close concordance with the observed statistics (Figure 5 and Figures S2,S3,S4). The evidence that the dispersal parameter (almost identical for three out of four census sites, Figure 3A) did not change significantly over time, and the fact that this parameter was estimated with substantial precision with few snapshots, are encouraging results in view of control decisions where the scale of control depends on the scale of dispersal [54]\u2013[56].",

            "text": "In contrast with the dispersal parameter, estimates for the transmission rates (\u03b2, \u03b5) were not constant (Figures 2E,F and Figures 3B\u2013I), with the secondary transmission rate \u03b2 showing substantial month to month fluctuations (Figures 3F\u2013H). This result bears two consequences: first, it can frustrate control efforts based on the assumption of a single, intrinsic transmission rate [56]. Second, prediction of future disease severity (upon which the decision to apply control is made) is difficult and prone to systematic error (Figure 6). We suggested that both \u03b2 and \u03b5 were driven by environmental variables that affected the infectivity, and possibly the susceptibility, of the host. Accordingly, we found strong evidence of a time pattern similar among all the census sites for the transmission rate \u03b2 (Figures 3\u20134; see also Figures S8, S9). Savill et al.\n[55] explored analogous problems for the infectiousness of infected premises in the 2001 UK foot and mouth epidemic, and identified missing and inaccurate data as a rate-limiting step in refining parameter estimates. For ACC, the principal environmental variables that are likely to influence the pathogen, Xac, and the disease are known to be wind-speed, rain and temperature [29], [30], [32]. Extreme weather events have indeed been identified, with robust statistical evidence [28], as the main determinants of the pattern of \u03b2 (Figures 3F\u2013H): major rainstorm events, acting as environmental pulses, were linked to peaks in the monthly series of transmission rates, and a drought was responsible for the strong quenching of the rates in the second half of the observation period. The existence of a common external driver is also supported (Figure 4 and Figure S9) by the close similarities in the temporal patterns of transmission rates across different sites. Nevertheless, extensive exploratory analysis using environmental data for temperature, wind and rain as covariates did not succeed in identifying a mechanistic environmentally-driven model for \u03b2. This was due in part to the (largely unknown) time-lags in the effect of weather events on the pathogen and the host. It is also reasonable to assume that environmental, weather-related forcing was just one, if the most important, of the factors affecting the behaviour of \u03b2. Factors intrinsic to the host population might also have played an important role: tree age, cultivar, and horticultural care can affect the susceptibility to the disease [28]. In a population of residential trees, the distribution of such individual factors is extremely heterogeneous in space at several scales, and also fluctuates over time. In the present case, as a result, there was a high degree of spatio-temporal variability in the response of hosts to weather drivers. Fitting models with explicit individual factors is unfeasible in such a highly heterogeneous scenario; however, such a class of models might be very useful in future analyses of outbreaks within commercial citrus plantations, where host properties are more consistently distributed.",

            "text": "We showed that, in retrospect, advance knowledge of major weather events would have been required in order to forecast future epidemic progress. Our methods, based on limited-information forecast scenarios, should be applicable more generally, e.g., to windborne diseases where transmission is mostly driven by strong weather changes. In our analysis (Figure 6), predictions based upon initial estimates, ignoring large weather-related fluctuations in transmission rates (Figures 3E\u2013I), showed progressively more deviation from the actual outcome as more epidemic snapshots were included in the estimation (scenario A, Figures 6A1\u2013A3). Post facto predictions were effective only when the assumption of complete ignorance of the future was waived (scenarios B and C, Figures 6B1\u2013B3, 6C1\u2013C6), and some extra information, corresponding to major environmental events, was known in advance (i.e., the drought period and the amplitude of the fluctuations in \u03b2 in scenario B; the peaks of \u03b2 in scenario C). At the same time, of course, meteorological predictability imposes drastic constraints on prior knowledge of that kind. For example, the evolution of position, intensity, and heavier rainfall areas of supercell thunderstorms (two of which were most likely responsible for the first two peaks in the time series for \u03b2) can currently not be predicted with more than 2 hours lead time [57]. We can then draw a more general conclusion from our results: that the spatial and temporal scales for prediction must be chosen carefully, not only to match the scales of disease spread [54]\u2013[56], but also with respect to the scales of the weather events that might affect the spread. The spatial and temporal scales considered here (a few km and \u223c1 y, respectively) proved to be \u201ctoo small\u201d for prediction: at those scales, the model output is extremely sensitive to the number and timing of isolated rare weather events (i.e., the effect of those events could not be averaged out). An important question that arises is whether or not our results could be up-scaled: that is, how prediction would perform over larger (e.g., state-wide) spatial scales and longer (e.g., decadal) temporal scales, using the parameter values calculated here and weather templates (cf. [58]) to generate time series for transmission rates. This is the object of ongoing investigation.",

Our system was mainly driven by stochastic weather events occurring on very short time scales. At longer scales, we can consider influenza and mosquito-borne diseases as further contrasting illustrations. Following recent evidence [59] that absolute humidity is a strong driver of the rates of transmission and survival of the influenza virus, a framework to predict seasonal outbreaks of influenza was recently proposed [60]. With daily climatological data and real-time population disease status as inputs, retrospective forecasts could predict historical peaks of influenza outbreak with good accuracy seven weeks in advance [60]. While this case concerns short-term seasonal changes in weather, longer-term changes are also known to influence the risk and spread of disease. The importance of climate on the spread of mosquito-borne diseases is broadly accepted [61]\u2013[63] though very complex and not fully understood [64]\u2013[66]. Large scale weather anomalies, such as unusually long rain [67] or drought periods [68], [69], can lead to unpredictable vector densities, which in turn frustrates public health planning [70]. Global climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of unpredictable extreme weather events, with a far-reaching projected impact on many infectious diseases [70]. In the face of such future challenges, it will be increasingly important for epidemiologists to explore and identify the external factors limiting the predictive capability of their models.",
