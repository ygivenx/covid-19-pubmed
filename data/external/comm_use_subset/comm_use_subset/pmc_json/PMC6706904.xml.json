Studies of immunocompromised hosts suggest that T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of mycoplasma infection. This is further supported by an apparent correlation between the development of a delayed hypersensitivity skin reaction to MP infection and the severity of disease. [6, 7] In some cases of MP pneumonia, an active host immune response promoting the release of cytokines and a T-helper (Th)-1-mediated immune response may contribute to severe pulmonary injury. Furthermore, MP pneumonia may be related to mononuclear cell infiltration into the airway, which is mainly composed of CD4+ T cells, contributing to substantial amplification of the immune response and subsequent injury to the lung parenchyma.

This cytoplasmic enzyme is present in all major organs, including the brain, kidneys, liver, myocardium, and lungs. When cell lysis occurs or cell membranes are damaged, LDH is released into the extracellular space. Therefore, LDH levels can be used as a surrogate marker for tissue breakdown. Previous studies have shown that serum LDH levels are increased in patients with refractory MP pneumonia, including children requiring steroid therapy. [5, 11\u201316] We propose that LDH can be used as an initial indicator of refractory MP pneumonia, although further studies are necessary to confirm the usefulness of serum LDH level as an indicator of severity and the need for steroid therapy in MP pneumonia.",

In addition to their effector function in the defense against extracellular pathogens, Th17 cells promote many inflammatory conditions, including several lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In mice inoculated with live MP, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increases both IL-17 concentration and neutrophil counts. Similarly, IL-17-linked signal activation has been observed in patients with MP pneumonia who showed significantly higher levels of serum IL-17 than those with streptococcal pneumonia. Since IL-17 has been found to play a role in the transition from innate immunity to adaptive immunity, these observations lead to the hypothesis that some components of the MP extract induce IL-17, which in turn causes the excessive inflammatory cell reactions observed in MP pneumonia patients.

Recent studies have revealed elevated levels of serum IL-18 in children with MP pneumonia; the levels rose during the acute phase of the infection.

In the early stages of infection, phagocytic cells are stimulated to synthetize and release cytokines, which in turn stimulate the synthesis of ferritin. Increased serum levels of ferritin exert an immunosuppressive effect through the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. Excess ferritin also reflects increased levels of TNF-\u03b1, an important apoptotic factor, and of cytotoxic markers such as aspartate aminotransferase, LDH, and creatine kinase, which can indicate increased apoptosis.

Rather than using the classic particle agglutination test, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Vircell, Granada, Spain) was used to identify MP as the causative organism of pneumonia. The antigen, composed of an extract of inactivated MP, was bound to the solid phase and incubated with diluted patient serum samples that blocked the IgG antibodies while the specific IgM proteins were bound to the antigen. After washing to eliminate unreacted proteins, samples were incubated with a conjugate consisting of anti-human IgM monoclonal antibodies and peroxidase. Conjugates that did not react were eliminated, and a peroxidase substrate was added. The blue color that developed was proportional to the concentration of specific antibodies present in the test serum. The results were expressed as an index (ratio between the optical density of the test sample and that of the cut-off value) that could be used as a quantitative measure, as it was proportional to the amount of specific IgM present. The test serum was considered positive when the ratio was > 1.1.",

This suggests that, taken together, these biomarkers may be a useful tool to distinguish between common and refractory MP pneumonia, as well as between MP and viral pneumonia at hospital admission. These findings should allow for other appropriate therapies for refractory MP pneumonia to be combined with macrolide treatment and administered earlier. In order to use these results clinically, it is necessary to continue study on a larger number of subjects.",
