For instance, one study has engineered a recombinant human adenoviral vector to encoding the full S protein or the S1 domain protein of HCoV-EMC/2012 isolate. Both adeno-based vaccines were evaluated in BALB/c mice and found to induce T-cell responses and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against MERS-CoV [3,4,5]. Similarly, a recombinant modified vaccinia virus expressing the full S protein was developed. This vaccinia-based vaccine was evaluated against MERS-CoV in Ad5-hDPP4-transduced BALB/c mice and showed significant induction of humoral and cell-mediated immunity and nAbs [6,7]. In addition, using Ad5-hDPP4-transduced BALB/c mice immunized with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles containing S protein resulted in a reduction of viral titers to nearly undetectable levels by 1 day post infection (pi) and increased nAbs [8]. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing spike gene of MERS-CoV induced immunological T-cell response and virus neutralization in rhesus monkeys against VSV and MERS-CoV with a single immunization [9].",

A new recombinant H1N1 NA carrying short peptide of MERS-CoV (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3) was successfully constructed by recombinant ligation and cloning in pHW2000 vector (Figure 1A). Using the eight-plasmid reverse genetics system, recombinant 5 + 3 rgH1N1 (Control virus), and chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 (candidate bivalent virus) were generated. The reverse genetic system to generate the chimeric bivalent virus is illustrated in Figure 1B. The rescued bivalent and control viruses were propagated in SPF embryonated chicken eggs for three passages and were safe to embryos (no mortality) at 48 h post infection (pi). The inserted sequence for the immunogenic peptide of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein was stable without any associated adaptive mutations/deletions in the NA gene during three successive passages in eggs.

The development of an effective bivalent vaccine against influenza and MERS-CoV infections is urgently required especially in the areas where both viruses are co-circulating. Thus, designing novel strategies to prevent MERS-CoV and influenza infections is in demand. A previous study showed that aa 736\u2013761 of the MERS-CoV spike epitope elicit robust neutralizing activities and block viral infection [15]. Herein, we developed a novel recombinant bivalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV using rescued influenza virus carrying the short immunogenic peptide 736\u2013761 of the S protein in the NA gene. The short peptide of MERS-CoV was inserted at position 48 aa in the NA-stalk domain of influenza A/H1N1. This unique site was selected based on the distinct natural deletion in the corresponding neuraminidase subtype (N1) of H5N1 isolates in Egypt since 2006 [16,17]. For safety reasons, we preferred to test the NA of H1N1 instead of H5N1 as a shuttle for the MERS-CoV spike immunogenic epitope.",

The developed vaccine seed virus replicated well without any associated adaptive mutations. Previous studies indicated that the insertion of reporter genes into the influenza viral NS, M, or NA-encoding segment was successful [22,23]. The inserted reporter genes in influenza viral genome were associated with inconstant expression levels and genome instability to dispose the foreign insertion.

Mice vaccinated with the chimeric bivalent virus were protected from mortality and body weight loss at 2 weeks of challenge with wild type H1N1pdm09 virus. At week 4, an apparent decline in antibody levels of specific immune response was observed. This is likely related to a traditional phenomenon, namely self-limitation or resolution, in which the neutralizing antibodies titer is decreased following the booster immunization as a response to the administrated antigens [24,25]. Several studies showed that the protective efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines positively correlates with the evoked neutralizing antibody titers in the serum of vaccinated animals [26,27]. These results are in accordance with the results of other viral platforms chimeric viruses carrying spike protein which provided nAbs against MERS-CoV [9,28].",

Briefly, collected sera were firstly heated at 56 \u00b0C/30 min in water bath for inactivation. Sera were then two-fold serially diluted in 40 \u00b5L of DMEM/2% FBS (diluted from 1:20 to 1:160). To each sera dilution, an equal volume/amount of the plaque forming unit in 40 \u00b5L DMEM/2% FBS was supplied. After 1 h co-incubation of the serum/virus mixtures, 50 \u00b5L of each mixture were dispensed individually into 12-well tissue culture plates containing confluent monolayers of Vero-E6 cell. The cell monolayers were incubated together with the serum/virus mixtures at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow virus adsorption. The infected Vero monolayers were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and supplied with agarose overlay containing 1\u00d7 MEM media, 1% agarose, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep), and then left to solidify. The plates were incubated until the formation of visible viral plaques (72 h). Cell monolayers were fixed with 3.4% formaldehyde solution for 1 h and stained with 1% crystal violet solution for 30 min at RT. Eventually, the plates were washed with water to visualize the plaques and the percent (%) of inhibition is calculated as following:% of plaque reduction = (virus control plaques count \u2212 sample plaques count)/(virus control plaques count) \u00d7 100.",
