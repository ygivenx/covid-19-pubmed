            "text": "Acute undifferentiated fever (AUF) is a temporary febrile illness accompanied by nonspecific manifestations [1]. It is frequently observed in clinical practice, but the diagnosis of its causes, particularly in developing and tropical countries, is often a challenge for clinicians due to the diversity of potential causes and the limited availability of diagnostic tools [1,2]. In addition, the research on febrile illness has many gaps, such as the limited epidemiological knowledge of fevers, the use of nonspecific tests and the lack of control groups, which limit the ability to definitively conclude the role of an infectious agent as the cause of AUF [1,3]. Therefore, prospective studies enrolling patients with AUF and controls, using paired sera for serological tests as well as direct methods of pathogen detection, are necessary to better decipher the aetiologies of AUF. Accordingly, the results obtained from such studies can lead to recommendations regarding prophylactic and/or treatment measures for local populations and travellers.",

            "text": "Vietnam has been highly successful in controlling malaria, but despite the rapid decline in malaria, fever caused by nonmalarial aetiologies remains a common reason for hospital admission [4]. Although AUF is observed daily in hospitals, the precise cause is usually not known due to the lack of diagnostic tools in most hospitals in the country. In a few recent studies, dengue infection (33.6%), influenza (4.1%) and other respiratory viral infections (5.3%) were reported as common causes of AUF in southern Vietnam [5,6]. However, these studies likely focused only on some pathogen groups of viruses or bacteria and did not include afebrile controls. In a case-control study with 1193 febrile patients and 282 afebrile individuals conducted in Cambodia, which shares a border with Vietnam, the most frequent pathogens detected were Plasmodium vivax (33.4%), Plasmodium falciparum (26.5%), Leptospira (9.4%), influenza virus (8.9%), Dengue virus (6.3%) and rickettsial agents (4.1%), but a significant proportion of malaria parasites and Leptospira were also observed in the control group [7]. Such data require careful interpretation of the role of pathogens in febrile illness, and more clinical studies are needed to verify the findings.",

Patients with AUF usually had high fever and a short course of illness, with a mean peak temperature of 39.2\u00b0C (95% CI: 39.1\u201339.3) and a median febrile duration of 5 (4\u20136) days. The most common accompanying symptom was headache (81.0%), followed by disappetite (54.5%), muscle pain (44.3%), dizziness (37.5%), cough (30.4%), back pain (28%) and other less frequent symptoms. A small proportion of AUFs also presented some clinical signs, such as rash (4.3%), lymphadenopathy (4.0%), eschar (3.2%), haemorrhage (2.4%), hepatomegaly (0.8%) and splenomegaly (0.5%). Shock, altered mental status, and seizures were not observed in our patients.

Abnormal aminotransferase levels were observed in 116 (30.7%) patients, which presented either an elevated level of one (elevated AST in 21 cases, elevated ALT in 6 cases) or both of the enzymes (89 cases). Abdominal ultrasound confirmed some cases presenting with hepatomegaly or splenomegaly but did not indicate other abnormal signs. The chest X-ray and urine analysis results did not indicate specific abnormalities in any cases. No patients were excluded because of being human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. No specific aetiological diagnoses were made for any febrile patients during the sampling period.\n",

In our study, R. felis was the only SFG rickettsia detected. R. felis infection has been identified as an emerging rickettsiosis worldwide and an important cause of AUF in sub-Saharan Africa [18,19]. Fleas have been recognized as vectors of R. felis, but mosquitoes, such as Anopheles gambiae, the major vector of malaria, may also transmit this agent [19]. Few cases of this emerging infection have been identified in Asia [18], and our three R. felis cases might be the first evidence of its existence in Vietnam. Because R. felis has also been detected in control afebrile patients in Africa [20] and in Asia, as in our study, further investigation is needed to precisely determine the role of R. felis in AUF in the tropics.",

A finding of skin rash or eschar can increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of rickettsial infections. Here, among 16 AUF patients with rash, four patients had rickettsial infections (three cases of murine typhus and one case of scrub typhus), one had leptospirosis, one was coinfected with scrub typhus and leptospirosis, and 10 patients had an undetected cause. The appearance of rash in scrub typhus varies depending on the O. tsutsugamushi genotype and might be less frequent in Vietnamese patients with scrub typhus [25,26].

An eschar sometimes appears in R. felis infection [27] and is an important diagnostic sign. Skin rash might present as maculopapular in 70% of patients with R. felis infection [18,28], but this symptom might also be absent. However, it appears that studies reporting the absence of rash included limited cases of R. felis infections [29,30]. We believe that the suggestive manifestations (e.g. eschar and rash) of R. felis infection might be observed in a significant proportion of patients, but these are insufficiently reported due to the lack of a careful examination and the absence of epidemiological information. Because R. felis is an emerging agent and is known to be a cause of AUF in Vietnam, its presence should be examined in such patients with AUF, including local patients and travellers who returned from Vietnam and similar areas.",

The dengue proportion of 11.1% detected in our study is underestimated because patients with dengue-positive RDTs were excluded from the study. The known sensitivity (6.4\u201381.5%) of the RDTs could lead to the misdiagnosis of dengue infection cases [35,36]. A clinical analysis focusing on 28 patients with dengue monoinfection showed almost nonspecific manifestations, which were difficult to distinguish from other causes, even in two patients with petechiae (subcutaneous haemorrhages). Although thrombopenia and leukopoenia are not specific for dengue infection, these manifestations were observed more frequently in dengue cases than in the other cases included in our study.",

Although influenza is reputedly linked to cold weather in temperate regions [51], it occurs throughout the year in tropical regions such as Vietnam [50]. Because of the high proportion of coinfection with influenza virus and bacteria observed in this study (Table 5), antibiotics might be considered in several cases, particularly in elderly or risk-associated patients, because the majority of influenza-related deaths are caused by bacterial superinfection [52]. An influenza vaccination programme should be discussed for the local population in Vietnam, at least for the populations at high risk for severe influenza, including pregnant women, children aged <5 years, the elderly, and individuals with underlying health conditions [53].",

Unlike other studies that used serological tests, which might yield false-positive results due to cross-reacting antibodies or the nonspecific polyclonal immunoreactivity of different aetiologies [57], we used a qPCR-direct method for pathogen detection and thus obtained strong evidence of the presence of the detected pathogens in the codetection cases. However, the results should be carefully interpreted because the presence of a microorganism in a febrile patient does not always indicate that it is a cause of the fever, and PCR cannot differentiate between infection and carriage or colonization. Thus, we first assessed every detected virus or bacterium in comparison to its frequency in AUFs and Controls, and we then evaluated the combination of positive clinical manifestations in the febrile patients and the presence of viruses or bacteria if their presence was not significantly different between the AUFs and Controls. Accordingly, although the detected frequency of various viruses and bacteria, particularly in throat swabs, was significant, we considered only 73 codetections, which consisted of coinfection with two or three pathogens, as causes or probable causes of AUF (Table 5).",

Only splenomegaly was associated with leptospirosis. Haemorrhage, low WBC count (<4 k/\u00b5L) and low PLT count (<150 k/\u00b5L) were associated with dengue infection. The presence of cough was associated with influenza, whereas a young age (<30 years) was associated with noninfluenza respiratory viral infection.

The extensive and systematic workup of this study provided unique data on the causes of AUF in Vietnam because we used reference methods and local afebrile subjects as controls, which allowed us to better clarify differences between infection and colonization. These data have implications for the management of patients with AUF in Vietnam and even Southeast Asia. We recommend that in addition to RDTs for dengue and microscopy for malaria, local hospitals should be equipped with diagnostic tools (e.g. RDTs, serological tests, and molecular biology tests) for rickettsial infections, leptospirosis, and influenza. More importantly, a significant proportion (15.6% if we include rickettsial diseases and leptospirosis) of the causative agents of AUF are susceptible to doxycycline. Therefore, this drug needs to be included in the panel used to treat patients with AUF. Empirical treatment with a combination of \u03b2-lactam (e.g. ceftriaxone) and doxycycline might be used to treat AUF patients with a severe clinical presentation because some agents detected here could result in fatality.",

Some patients who presented with several sporadic symptoms (e.g. cough, sore throat, breathlessness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) that were not consistent with physical examination results in a clinical diagnosis were also included in the study. We excluded dengue fever and malaria because these diseases are well known to be common causes of febrile illness in Vietnam, and their diagnostic tests are available in almost all hospitals in Vietnam. Thus, we excluded patients who tested positive for malaria on a peripheral blood smear (Giemsa stained thick and thin films) or for dengue on RDTs for nonstructural 1 glycoprotein (NS1) antigen/IgM. We also excluded patients with other conditions that could bias the results, such as receiving cancer chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, having HIV infection, and hospitalized for \u226572 h within the preceding 30 days. HIV testing was not performed routinely. We performed HIV ELISA testing only for patients who had never been tested for HIV infection if their clinical symptoms and signs suggested an immunosuppression condition. To ensure a complete follow-up during the illness course, only inpatients with AUF admitted to infectious disease wards were considered for this study.",

Accordingly, only AUF patients who were negative for these diseases were included in this study. After obtaining written informed consent from the participants, the clinicians recorded their vital signs, signs and symptoms of the current illness, their history of exposure to the forest within 30 days, chronic comorbidity diseases and basic clinical laboratory results on a case report form (CRF). A nurse collected a total of 3 mL of whole blood, divided into 1 mL of whole blood in an EDTA tube and approximately 1 mL of plasma in a dry tube after centrifugation, and 1 mL of urine from each participant. One throat swab specimen was taken by a clinician and preserved immediately into a viral transport medium. The clinician also collected eschar swab specimens if the patient presented with one or several eschars based on a previously described method [26]. In addition, from each patient with AUF, we collected 1 mL of plasma in the convalescent phase, which occurred 7\u201310 days after the first plasma collection. All the specimens were immediately preserved at \u221220\u00b0C at the hospitals in Quang Nam province (Vietnam) until analysis at the University Hospital Institute M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille (France).",
