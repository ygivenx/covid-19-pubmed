            "text": "Nitazoxanide (NTZ), 2-acetyloxy-N-(5-nitro-2-thiazolyl)benzamide, is a synthetic nitrothiazole derivative (Scheme 1) with a broad spectrum of applications as an antiparasitic, antibacterial and antiviral agent, being effective against protozoal infections, helminths, gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and diverse viruses (respiratory viruses, rotavirus, norovirus, coronavirus, hepatitis B and C, dengue-2, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and human immunodeficiency viruses) [1,2,3]. Moreover, NTZ has shown anticancer activity [4], suppresses the production of interleukins (IL) such as IL-6 [5], and is a promising compound for the treatment of neuropathic pain and the Ebola virus disease [6,7]. However, due to poor aqueous solubility (0.0075 mg/mL), NTZ has low bioavailability and requires high doses for treatment [8]. Considering its high permeability across intestinal epithelium [9], NTZ is a class II drug according to the criteria established by the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS). To take advantage of the broad therapeutic spectrum of NTZ, the implementation of strategies to modify its solubility are necessary. A general strategy to overcome the limited solubility of drugs is the generation of novel solid phases, such as metastable amorphous, polymorphs, salts and, more recently, cocrystals [10,11,12].",

If at least one of the components is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and if the coformer is pharmaceutically acceptable, then the substance is recognized as pharmaceutical cocrystal. A pharmaceutical cocrystal can offer multiple benefits for physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of APIs, such as increased solubility and dissolution rates, improvement of mechanical properties, and stability [13,14,15]. Particularly, cocrystals have exhibited higher, similar or lower solubility compared to the parent API, depending on the nature of the coformer and the solution conditions [16,17]. Solubility advantages of cocrystals over parent drugs can be higher by orders of magnitude, however, this also represents a risk due to precipitation to the less soluble form of the drug at supersaturated concentrations reached during the dissolution process [18,19].",

A strategy to control cocrystal dissolution, drug supersaturation and precipitation is the use of supersaturated formulations, which incorporates additives and excipients such as cyclodextrins, surfactants and polymers [22]. In such systems, the supersaturation state must be maintained over a reasonable time period in order to promote adequate absorption for increased bioavailability. In this line, there are several recent reports on the effect of polymers and surfactants in increasing solubility and dissolution rates of poorly soluble drugs, starting from a cocrystalline solid phase. Some representative APIs and nutraceutical compounds studied under this approach are celecoxib [23], danazol [24], indomethacin [25], carbamazepine [26,27,28,29,30,31], flufenamic acid [32], cilostazol [33], resveratrol [34], dihydromyricetin [35], tadalafil [36], exemestane [37] and posaconazole [38].",

In both publications, improved intrinsic dissolution rates were documented, showing that NTZ cocrystals can improve the solubilization of NTZ in physiologically relevant media [8], thus being good candidates for the future development of novel dosage forms. Herein, two cocrystals, viz., NTZ-GLU and NTZ-SUC (GLU = glutaric acid; SUC = succinic acid), were chosen to evaluate the effect of two cellulosic polymers, namely hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and methylcellulose (Methocel\u00ae 60 HG) (Scheme 1), on the dissolution performance of the API, in comparison with pure NTZ, a commercially available NTZ medicine and the respective physical mixtures of NTZ and the coformer. Our study includes an API widely used in treatments concerning tropical neglected diseases, even though scarcely studied [45]. The purpose of this work was to study the behavior of NTZ cocrystals in solution and the conditions to sustain supersaturation levels since these conditions cannot be apparent and must be studied case-by-case. Given its therapeutic relevance, approaches to formulate nitazoxanide cocrystals will be of benefit to improve its efficacy, considering that its low solubility impacts its bioavailability. Importantly, nitazoxanide has been proposed as a potential agent for public health control [46].",

The corresponding graphs are shown in Figure 2. In the absence of polymer, there is no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between the profile of NTZ and those obtained for the cocrystals (Figure 2a), maintaining on average a saturated NTZ concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. On the contrary, in the presence of pre-dissolved HPMC and Methocel\u00ae 60 HG, the NTZ dissolution profiles of the pure form and the cocrystals are significantly different (p < 0.05) (Figure 2b,c). Thus, starting from the cocrystals, pre-dissolved HPMC and Methocel\u00ae 60 HG enable the generation of transient drug concentrations (approximately 2 mg/mL) that are 4 times above NTZ solubility, following a spring\u2013parachute profile as postulated by Guzman et al. [48]. This supersaturation state is sustained for approximately 30 min, for both cocrystals. The decay of the NTZ concentration is attributed to precipitation of pure NTZ, as indicated by PXRD analyses of the solid residues recovered after the dissolution experiments with NTZ-GLU and NTZ-SUC, that showed characteristic diffraction peaks of pure NTZ (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Overall, this analysis shows that indeed NTZ-GLU and NTZ-SUC have superior dissolution properties compared to the parent drug, suggesting that dissolution kinetics of the cocrystalline phases is extremely rapid, supersaturating the solution and precipitating in a short time period (~1\u20135 min), which is in agreement with our previous studies on the solution-phase stability of NTZ-GLU and NTZ-SUC in PBS pH 7.5 [8]. However, in the presence of pre-dissolved HPMC and Methocel\u00ae 60 HG, the precipitation of pure NTZ is delayed by a time interval long enough to envision a potential improvement of the bioavailability (~30 min, see Discussion section).",

The drug dissolution profiles are similar (p > 0.05), achieving approximately 8 mg of dissolved drug (ca. 3% in relation to 250 mg of NTZ dose). In contrast, when the solid phases were formulated with 1.0% Methocel\u00ae 60 HG, the drug was dissolved in significantly larger amounts, either starting from the pure form, the physical mixture or the cocrystal (~17\u201327 mg of drug dissolved after 3 h). Although the graph associated to NTZ-SUC exhibits a larger increase, the statistical difference (p > 0.05) between the dissociation rates is not significant due to the relatively large standard deviation (Figure 6b). However, with larger amounts of Methocel\u00ae 60 HG polymer (2.5 and 5.0%), the NTZ-SUC cocrystal gave a significantly improved dissolution profile (p < 0.05) when compared to analogous formulations of pure NTZ and the physical mixture, achieving after 3 h, amounts of 42 and 45 mg of NTZ dissolved (Figure 6c,d). Furthermore, for the formulation of the cocrystal with 5% Methocel\u00ae 60 HG, the amount of NTZ dissolved after 2 min was already approximately 12 mg (Figure 6d), which is significantly larger than the final amount achieved by the corresponding unformulated solid phases (Figure 6a).",

Figure 2a shows that NTZ-GLU and NTZ-SUC cocrystals have dissolution profiles similar to NTZ in pH 7.5 phosphate buffer solution, and a higher solubilization of NTZ is not observed under these conditions. Indeed, rapid conversion of the cocrystals into pure drug was demonstrated by PXRD analysis of the solids recovered after the dissolution tests in short time periods (~1\u20135 min, Figure 3). A similar behavior has been documented for other cocrystal phases in the literature [24,25,30,36,37,55,56,57]. For example, exemestane\u2013maleic-acid cocrystals did not increase solubilization of the drug due to rapid phase transformation [55]. In a recent publication this cocrystal was reinvestigated observing that transformation into the parent drug occurred in less than 1 min in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) [37]. The critical role of the coformer physicochemical properties on the solubility and dissolution advantages of cocrystals it is now accepted, even though the exact mechanism by which this enhancement occurs is not fully understood. In NTZ cocrystals studied here, the coformers GLU and SUC are ionizable compounds (pKa values of 4.3 for GLU and 4.2 for SUC) and exhibit favorable water solubilities of 540 mg/mL and 71 mg/mL at 25 \u00b0C, respectively [12,58]. The fast dissolution\u2013supersaturation phenomenon induced for the NTZ cocrystals under the experimental conditions used herein (pH 7.5 PBS), is attributed to the favorable solubilization of these coformers. This rapid cocrystal dissolution produces drug supersaturation levels that are difficult to control in absence of suitable excipients at adequate concentrations, and therefore NTZ solubilization advantage was not observed.",

An addition of a cellulosic polymer into the dissolution medium for powder dissolution studies under non-sink conditions revealed that these can induce a supersaturation effect starting from NTZ-SUC and NTZ-GLU cocrystals. Both Methocel\u00ae 60 HG and HPMC were able to maintain drug supersaturation (up to 4 times higher concentrations of NTZ in solution over solubility value) for a period long enough to display a superior dissolution profile (Figure 2b,c). The phenomenon was upheld for up to 30 min, emulating the spring\u2013parachute effect [48]. There are some studies demonstrating an in vitro/in vivo correlation of formulated cocrystals. In these cases, the in vitro dissolution test showed that the high drug concentration achieved by cocrystalline phases is maintained by 30\u201340 min and the bioavailability of the corresponding poorly soluble drugs was enhanced [24,33]. Considering these experimental data, it is considered that the increase of NTZ dissolved from NTZ cocrystals formulated with polymers may promote NTZ absorption.",

Therefore, the improvement of the NTZ dissolution profiles in the presence of pre-dissolved polymer could be explained by the following mechanism: after the rapid NTZ release into solution starting from the cocrystal, the cellulosic polymer interacts with NTZ molecules delaying its nucleation and eventually NTZ crystallized also interact with polymer interfering the crystal growth and agglomeration process.",

However, there are few studies which have tested the effect of a polymer incorporated in the powder solid-state form on the dissolution profiles of cocrystals [23]. In order to evaluate the effect of Methocel\u00ae 60 HG on the dissolution process of NTZ-SUC cocrystals starting from a solid polymer\u2013cocrystal formulation, we examined a series of pharmaceutical powder-based formulations containing different amounts of Methocel\u00ae 60 HG (0.0, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0% w/w) in comparison to analogous forms with pure NTZ and the physical mixture of NTZ and SUC. In the absence of polymer, all solid phases released similar amounts of NTZ into the solution during the powder dissolution studies using the USP 1 apparatus (Figure 6a) and the NTZ-SUC cocrystal did not show a solubility advantage in comparison with the pure drug and the physical mixture. This observation can be attributed to immediate conversion of the cocrystal phase into NTZ and release of SUC into the solution, in accordance with the dissolution experiments under non-sink conditions. Formulations of pure NTZ, the physical mixture with SUC, and NTZ-SUC cocrystals with 1% (w/w) of Methocel\u00ae 60 HG showed dissolution profiles being similar among each other, but at higher concentrations, i.e., 2.5 and 5.0% (w/w), a significant increase of the dissolution rate was observed (Figure 6c,d and Figure 7).",
