            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic proliferative synovitis, with hyperplasia of the synovial lining cells, inflammatory cell infiltration and angiogenesis in the sublining cell layer. Hyperplastic synovial lining cells overproduce such matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP, which may be involved in tissue remodeling during angiogenesis and cartilage destruction. Articular cartilage at the margins of the articular surface, to which synovium tissue can directly attach, is progressively degraded even in the disease's early stage. As macrophage-like synoviocytes (MLS) and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are known as the most active cells and are close to the articular cartilage in a position to invade the cartilage, their expression of MMPs and their interaction have been reported to be related to cartilage destruction. Although IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha are reported by some studies as key regulators of matrix degradation in RA, other molecules, such as CD147, are also thought to have played some regulatory role in RA pathogenesis [1-4]. But very few reports have been presented on CD147 functions in cartilage destruction.",

The cell suspension was passed through a nylon mesh and the cells were then collected by centrifugation at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes and were re-suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The harvested cells were cultured in 75 cm2 culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% L-glutamine (Gibco) and with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. When the cells had grown to confluence they were detached with 0.25% trypsin, split in a 1:3 ratio and were re-cultured in DMEM under the same conditions. To eliminate the non-adherent cells, the plated cells were washed thoroughly with PBS. Isolated synoviocytes were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells used for our experiments were at the third to fifth passage, because these cells were more purified than the first and second passages of FLS and had better biological functions than the cells above the fifth passage. The FLS were identified by flow cytometric analysis as a homogeneous population (phenotype: <1% CD14, <1% CD68 and >98% CD90) [13,14].",

Conditioned media were collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris and the supernatant was collected and stored at -20\u00b0C. Each sample suspension (20 \u03bcl) was mixed with SDS sample buffer without reducing agent, followed by detection of the gelatinolytic activity and quantity in the conditioned media by gelatin zymography [22,23]. In brief, the conditioned medium was resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions using 8% separating gel containing 0.1% gelatin. The gels were then washed twice in 2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at room temperature to remove SDS and were incubated in reaction buffer containing 50 mmol/l Tris, 0.2 mol/l NaCl, 5 mmol/l anhydrous CaCl2 and 2.5% Triton X-100 for 20 hours at 37\u00b0C. The buffer was suitable for proteinase activity, enabling the renatured proteinases to hydrolyze the copolymerized protein substrate in a zone around their position of electrophoresis. The gels were subsequently stained with 0.5% Coomassie blue (R-250) and destained with buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 10% acetic acid and 70% distilled water for 30 minutes to visualize these zones of digestion as light areas against the darkly stained protein background. The zymography gels were scanned and analyzed using US National Institutes of Health Image 1.6 software.",

Prior to the addition of the cell suspension of FLS, THP-1 cells and co-culture cells (3 \u00d7 105) in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of HAb18G/CD147 antagonist peptide AP-9, the dried layer of matrigel matrix was rehydrated with medium without FBS (450 \u03bcl).

Some cytokines in the synovial fluid of RA patients, such as interferon gamma and granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor, may also enhance the expression of CD147 on the monocytes/macrophages from synovial fluid of RA patients. The overexpression of CD147 on differentiated monocytes/macrophages suggests that CD147 may be important in the early phases of direct cell migration and of both autocrine and paracrine stimulation of MMP expression.

To explore the effect of cell\u2013cell interaction on the production of MMPs and the invasiveness of RA synoviocytes, RA FLS were co-cultured with THP-1 cells in the present study. We have found that the expression of CD147 on RA FLS is enhanced by cell\u2013cell interaction, and that the secretion and activation of MMPs and the invasive potential of RA FLS are also enhanced. These results suggest that the overexpression of CD147 on macrophages may accelerate the production of MMPs and the invasive ability of RA FLS by cell\u2013cell interaction. The overexpression of CD147 on FLS and the monocyte/macrophage lineage, especially on MLS, suggests that CD147 may be important in both autocrine and paracrine stimulation of MMPs. From the findings that homophilic CD147 binding has occurred in the context of both heterotypic and homotypic cell\u2013cell interactions and that CD147 can be a receptor in itself to induce MMP production, not only in primary fibroblast cells but also in tumor cells themselves [34], we presume that the increased expression of CD147 on FLS and the monocyte/macrophage lineage, especially on MLS, in RA synovium could possibly induce MMP production through interaction.",

We have found that the addition of CD147 antagonistic peptide has some inhibitory effect not only on the MMP production, but also on the invasive potential of the co-cultured FLS. The inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 production by CD147 antagonistic peptide indicates that CD147 may induce MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. The mechanism by which CD147 regulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 production is largely unclear, although a recent study has suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 pathway may be involved during MMP induction in dermal fibroblasts [35]. Our previous studies have indicated that overexpression of HAb18G/CD147 enhances metastatic potentials in human hepatoma cells by disrupting the regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry by nitric oxide/cGMP. CD147 is required to mediate the effect of HAb18G/CD147 on the secretion and activation of MMPs and metastasis-related processes in human hepatoma cells by disrupting the regulation of nitric oxide/cGMP-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ mobilization [19,20]. These findings also indicate that CD147 is involved in promoting the secretion and activation of MMPs, which in turn increases the invasive potential of FLS. These results also suggest that CD147 expression may be correlated to MMP (MMP-2, MMP-9) secretion, activation and invasive potential in RA FLS.",

(c) The value of proMMP-9, MMP-9, proMMP-2 and MMP-2 activity of RA FLS co-cultured with Mo-PB was higher than that of co-cultured cells treated by AP-9 (n = 6, P < 0.05), while no inhibitory effects were found in irrelevant peptide SSP (n = 6, P > 0.05). (d) The value of proMMP-9, MMP-9, proMMP-2 and MMP-2 activity of RA FLS co-cultured with Mo-SF was higher than that of co-cultured cells treated by AP-9 (n = 6, P < 0.05), while no inhibitory effects were found in irrelevant peptide SSP (n = 6, P > 0.05).

The invasive potential was evaluated in transwell chambers as described in Patients and methods. Briefly, cells were suspended in serum-free media supplemented with or without AP-9 or SSP (200 \u03bcg/ml) and seeded into the upper side of the matrigel (5 \u03bcg/ml)-coated chambers. After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C, the number of invaded cells was determined using a colorimetric H & E assay. Black arrow, FLS; white arrow, THP-1 cells (f \u00d7 200). (a) and (d) The invasive potential of RA FLS was higher than that of OA FLS (P < 0.05; six samples with RA FLS, four samples with OA FLS).
