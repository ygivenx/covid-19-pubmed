Despite a widespread vaccination program, over the past fifteen years was seen a return of pertussis worldwide [1]. Pertussis resurgence in Europe has been attributed to an incomplete immunization program or to genetic changes in Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis). [2] The currently used acellular pertussis vaccine contains the pertactin gene variant prn1 and the pertussis toxin-B S1 subunit [3,4]. Molecular changes in these two genes over the past years suggest that the antigenic divergence may make pertussis vaccination less effective than before [5,6].",

Hence, some infants remain unimmunized or incompletely immunized. In those who are incompletely immunized pertussis may develop in an atypical clinical form and be difficult to diagnose. Pertussis can be especially difficult to diagnose in children under 1 year of age during winter season, when other pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), circulate. In these difficult cases, pertussis acute respiratory symptoms can overlap with those of bronchiolitis. A study conducted in a group of infants hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis showed that almost 2% of the patients were co-infected with B. pertussis[7,8]. Since B. pertussis-RSV co-infection is infrequent in young infants, physicians should keep the possibility of co-infections in mind as to diagnose it early and prevent bronchiolitis from becoming more severe [9-12].",

Of the 38 hospitalized infants enrolled in our study, five with pertussis and four with bronchiolitis had already been vaccinated. In Italy, vaccination schedule provides a first pertussis vaccine dose at the age of 3 months, and the booster doses at 5 and 12 months of age. This finding confirms previous reports, showing that many children with pertussis have never been vaccinated against pertussis, and that the first dose (or the first two doses) often provides scarce protection [14,20-25].",

The \u201cuniversal\u201d indicator for characterizing the molecular features of B. pertussis is the catalytic subunit S1. Four S1 subunit variants have been described: S1-A (ptxA1), S1-B (ptxA2), S1-D (ptxA3), and S1-E (ptxA4) [2,4,6,16,18,19]. Culture and molecular data allowed us to identify strains that express the S1-A variant, whereas pertussis vaccine contains the S1-B variant [4]. Pertactin gene polymorphisms reside in regions called R1 and R2. As many as eleven different prn alleles have been identified [5,6]. Acellular pertussis vaccine contains the prn-1 allele. In the two infants whose aspirates were suitable for molecular genetic analysis, RT-PCR identified the prn-2 gene, also found in infants from other European countries (France and Finland) [5,6] and in Japan [4]. We also found in both strains the ptx-P3 variant of the pertussis toxin promoter. This variant allows bacteria to increase toxin production so that more severe clinical signs and symptoms manifest [3]. Unfortunately, we were able to analyze B. pertussis strains in only two infants because cultures were negative in 16 infants with PCR confirmed pertussis who were already receiving specific antibiotic therapy when specimens were collected, or because technical problems arose during sample collection.",

Molecular analysis suggests that also in Italy B. pertussis strains differ from those included in the current vaccine. These findings might call for a change in the current pertussis vaccination, according also to the current strategies in the US and other countries that include maternal immunization with Tdap.",
