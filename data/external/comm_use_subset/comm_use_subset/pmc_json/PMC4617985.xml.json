            "text": "Diabetes, or diabetes mellitus, is a metabolic disorder characterised by an excessive level of glucose in the blood. According to the eminent diabetologist, Robert Tattersall, \u2018diabetes is not a single disease but a syndrome with at least fifty possible causes\u2019 (Tattersall 2009, 15). The body either does not manufactured enough insulin or the cells do not respond effectively to the insulin produced. Insulin is an essential hormone secreted by the pancreas. It enables the body\u2019s cells to absorb glucose and convert it into energy required for muscle and tissue function. Since a person with diabetes is not able to properly metabolise the glucose in their blood, he or she may experience raised blood sugar or hyperglycaemia. Over time, an excessive level of blood sugar may lead to tissue damage and a range of life-threatening health complications including blindness, kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and limb amputations. In her article for The New York Times, physician, Abigail Zuger, described the importance of insulin as follows:Without insulin the body is unable to use glucose, its primary fuel \u2026 sugar and starch in the diabetic\u2019s diet turn into poison, clogging the bloodstream with unusable glucose: the glucose is eliminated in sweet-tasting urine as the body\u2019s cells literally starve in the midst of plenty. Insulin-deficient patients are both thirsty and ravenous, but the more they eat, the faster they waste away (Zuger 2010).",

The ancient Greeks understood diabetes as a condition in which food and liquid intake passes through the body instead of fuelling it. In the nineteenth century, to categorise different types of diabetes, French physician Etienne Lancereaux distinguished between diabete maigre (thin diabetes) and diabete gras (fat diabetes) (Tattersall 2009). Today, these categories are revised as Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. While the former is common among young people, the latter is generally diagnosed in the adult population. The former is an autoimmune disease associated with the destruction of insulin-producing islet cells. The latter is a common form of diabetes arising from the development of resistance to insulin. The risk of insulin-resistant diabetes increases with age.",

Minkowski also demonstrated that the auto-transplantation of pancreas fragments in depancreatised dogs could temporarily prevent diabetes (Benedum 1999). Following the work of Minkowski and von Mering, physicians began to conduct experimental transplants using pancreatic tissue in an attempt to ameliorate diabetes. In December 1893, Patrick Watson Williams performed a xenograft to treat a 15 year old patient critically ill with diabetes at the Bristol Royal Infirmary (Williams 1894). With the assistance of his surgical colleague, William Henry Harsant, Williams implanted three fragments of ovine pancreas into the subcutaneous tissue of the patient\u2019s breast and abdomen. Each fragment was comparable in size to a Brazil nut. The tissue was procured from a sheep \u2018freshly slaughtered.\u2019 In addition to the ovine graft, Williams also prescribed extracts from minced sheep pancreas as oral therapy. Though the patient\u2019s blood glucose fell after the operation, his condition deteriorated. He died in a diabetic coma 3 days later.",

In Australia, the earliest record of such surgery took place at the Launceston General Hospital in Tasmania. The operation was performed by the Surgeon Superintendent, Dr (later Sir) John Ramsay, in 1911. In an unpublished paper, Ramsay documented that he had the opportunity to perform an experimental procedure when a young male patient suddenly died of a heart condition.3 He excised a small portion of the tail of the cadaveric pancreas. Ramsay then grafted the partial pancreas into the abdomen of a 59 year old female diabetic. Within a week, the operation led to a gradual reduction in the level of glycosuria (the presence of sugar in the patient\u2019s urine). Indeed, Ramsay even reported that the lowest level of glycosuria fell to \u2018practically zero\u2019 (Morris 1988, 635). In subsequent days, however, it rose again to pre-operative levels indicating graft failure. The implanted tissue was eventually removed when the site of the surgery became inflamed. The patient lived for another 7 years after the transplant surgery.",

Not long after the successful isolation of insulin, Banting also attempted a pancreatic autograft in a dog though without success (Bliss 1992). After the Second World War, the field of organ transplantation emerged following successful kidney transplants between twins. In February 1963, Claude Hitchcock performed a renal allograft and xenograft on a 65 year old female diabetic with end-stage renal failure (Hitchcock et al. 1964). Hitchcock was the chief surgeon at Hennepin County Hospital in Minneapolis. Since renal allograft was rejected after 3 days, Hitchcock removed and replaced it with a kidney from a baboon. The baboon kidney functioned for 4 days before the patient died. Hitchcock described his experiment as the \u2018first baboon renal heterograft\u2019 (Hitchcock et al. 1964, 937).4",

A 28-year old patient with Type 1 diabetes received a pancreas segment along with a renal graft and duodedum. Following the transplant, the patient was insulin independent for 6 days. She received irradiation therapy to treat the development of graft pancreatitis. Due to organ rejection, both the kidney and pancreas were later removed. The patient died of surgical sepsis 2 months after the operation (Sutherland and Groth 2010). Today, diabetic patients may be offered either or both kidney and pancreas transplants depending on a number of considerations including the patient\u2019s renal function and the availability of organs. These procedures are termed simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant (SPK), pancreas after kidney transplants (PAK), pancreas transplant alone (PTA) and kidney transplant alone (KTA).",

The objective of such procedures is to infuse a sufficient quantity of islet cells to control the level of blood glucose and, thereby, overcome the need for exogenous insulin. Insulin-producing beta cells comprise only 1\u20132 % of the pancreas. Once the required tissue is isolated, a laparoscopic procedure is performed under local anaesthetic to implant the islet cells. Gruessner and Gruessner suggested that a pancreas transplant could be supplemented with an islet transplant to facilitate continued insulin-independence (Gruessner and Gruessner 2013). Through successful islet transplants, patients with renal function can avert the need for a kidney transplant. Islet transplantation is generally prescribed for Type 1 diabetes patients with unstable diabetes and severe hypoglycaemia unawareness. It is not advisable for all diabetic patients due to the scarcity of available islets and the adverse side-effects of immunosuppression drugs.",

Credit is attributed to Paul Lacy and his colleagues who invented a collagenase digestion technique necessary to isolate pancreatic islets (Lacy and Kostianovsky 1967). In 1970s, scientists demonstrated that islet transplantation could reverse diabetes in rodents, dogs and monkeys (Ballinger and Lacy 1972; Matas et al. 1976; Scharp et al. 1975). The first human islet allograft was performed in 1974 using cadaveric islet cells (Najarian et al. 1977). However, the procedure was unsuccessful possibly due to the effects of immunosuppression drugs. It was not until more than a decade later that Sharp and Lacy performed the first successful islet cell transplant (Scharp et al. 1990). After the operation, the patient was insulin-independent for almost 1 month. Though a modest achievement, this result was nevertheless a positive milestone for the field. Transplant surgeon, James Shapiro, has speculated on the potential efficacy of islet transplantation if immunological barriers can be resolved. In an article commemorating the discovery of insulin, he commented,\u2026 an islet transplant could function for the entire lifetime of the patient, as long as immunological damage from recurrence of autoimmunity or allograft rejection is prevented. The patient who has maintained islet function for the longest period to date received a transplant of her own islets after total pancreatectomy at the University of Minnesota over 16 years ago and she remains insulin independent (Shapiro 2002, 1399).",

Porcine islets have been sourced from fetal, neonatal and adult pigs. Source pigs may be wild-type or genetically modified. Pigs are an ideal source of islet cells because they are readily available, breed quickly, produce large litters and display insulin secretion patterns comparable to those found in humans (Liu and Harlan 2008). Porcine insulin was used to treat diabetics for many decades. The hyper-acute rejection of pig tissue may be ameliorated through cloning and genetic modification. Though pigs are generally the preferred source animal, researchers have also experimented with islet cells from other species including cows, rabbit and fish (Mihalicz et al. 2011). By comparison to non-human primates, pigs pose less disease risks and less ethical concerns since they are lower on the evolutionary scale (Boneva and Folks 2004).",

Though Groth first conceived of the idea in the mid-70s, it was not until the 1990s that he performed his clinical trial. Between 1990 and 1993, Groth treated ten participants with islet cells from porcine foetuses (Groth et al. 1994). The pig cells were either transplanted into the kidney capsule or infused into the intra-portal vein. A subsequent kidney biopsy identified viable islet cells and a related hormone called glucagon indicating insulin secretion. Though the trial did not lead to any reductions in the participant\u2019s insulin requirements, it did offer valuable preliminary data on graft function and indication of long term survival of porcine cells in the human body. Two years later, another team of Swedish scientist attempted to treat two dialysis patients with animal external therapy. Patient blood was circulated through pig kidneys for over an hour before it was returned to the patient\u2019s body (Hanson 2011).",

Some of these trials indicate that islet xenotransplantation reduces the required daily dosage of insulin and the incidence of hypoglycaemia (Torrie 2012).

The Nuffield Council on Bioethics, an independent British charity, conducted the first public inquiry on the topic. In March 1996, it issued an influential report titled, Animal-to-Human Transplants: The Ethics of Xenotransplantation. The Council\u2019s report concluded that it is \u2018ethically acceptable\u2019 to use pig organs and tissues for transplantation given the scarcity of human biological material (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 1996, viii). Adopting a precautionary approach on xenotransplantation, the report recommended the establishment of an advisory committee to oversee and monitor xenotransplantation research and clinical trials. According to Sobbrio and Jorqui, the Nuffield Council report was innovative since it was the first attempt to apply the precautionary principle to protect public health beyond the field of environmental science and humanities (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014). In the following year, an interdisciplinary committee appointed by the UK Department of Health put forward a comparable report. Commonly known as the \u2018Kennedy Report\u2019 after its chairperson, Sir Ian Kennedy, this document reiterated some of proposals made in the Nuffield Council report (U. K. Department of Health 1997). Following both reports, the government promptly set up the UK Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA). Inter alia, the terms of reference for UKXIRA instructed the authority to provide advice to government on \u2018safety, efficacy and considerations of animal welfare and any other pre-conditions for xenotransplantation for human use, and whether these have been met\u2019 (UKIXRA 1998, 24).",

Endogenous retroviruses are found in the genome of all mammal species. Since porcine retroviruses are embedded in the swine genome, it would be difficult to selectively breed pigs free of PERV and other pathogens. The expression of PERV DNA has been found in a wide range of pig organs and tissue including liver, lung, kidney, heart, pancreas, skin, blood, endothelial cells and bone marrow cells. Following in vitro laboratory experiments, Patience et al demonstrated that human cell lines could be infected by two strands of porcine retroviruses (Patience et al. 1997). In vitro infection does not necessarily lead to in vivo infection. Nevertheless, the possibility of PERV infection needs to be taken seriously given past precedents for animal-to-human viral transmission (eg rabies, Ebola, monkey pox and herpes virus B). The term \u2018xenozoonosis\u2019 was coined to refer to \u2018an infectious agent introduced to humans by xenogeneic tissue\u2019 (O'Connell et al. 2000, 18). The results from in vivo PERV studies catalysed a public debate within the scientific community and beyond on the ethics of conducting research posing public health risks.",

PERV transmission and infection has been documented in laboratory animals but not in human patients. For example, diabetic immuno-compromised mice were infected by PERV following transplantation of porcine islet cells (Van Der Laan et al. 2000). In August 1998, Swedish scientists published two papers in The Lancet. No PERV infection was found the blood samples obtained from ten diabetics who had undergone islet xenotransplantation (Heneine et al. 1998). Similarly, there was also a negative result on PERV transmission involving two dialysis patients exposed to procine xenoperfusion (Patience et al. 1998). In the following year, the lack of PERV infection was also confirmed in a large study of 160 patients published in Science (Paradis et al. 1999). This study consisted of patients from a number of countries who had undergone different types of therapies involving the use of animal tissue. Some participants received porcine islet cells to treat diabetes or temporary pig skin grafts to treat severe burns. Most of the cohort previously participated in a Russian xeno-perfusion experiment to assess an \u2018immunotherapy\u2019 (Paradis et al. 1999, 1237). Due to their clinical results, the authors of the study advocated the use of \u2018closely monitored clinical trails\u2019 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of porcine xenogenic therapies (Paradis et al. 1999, 1240). However, in an editorial comment, virologist, Robin Weiss, urged caution given the nature of epidemiological research. He argued that \u2018no evidence of risk\u2019 is not the same as \u2018evidence of no risk\u2019 (Weiss 1999, 1222).",

Notwithstanding his strong commitment to xenograft research, Bach argued against the premature introduction of such experimental procedures (Monaco 2011). He advocated for public debate and input to determine whether or not it was justifiable to undertake the research notwithstanding the inherent public health risks. Bach called for a moratorium until ethical questions could be resolved. In his view, ethical issues preceded technical scientific considerations.",

Similarly, in a 2007 paper written with Ivinson, Bach posed an ethical challenge to their scientific colleagues asking,Why should we not apply the principle of informed consent to entire communities when it is the community as a whole that is being exposed to the risk? At the very least, informed representatives of the public should be given an opportunity to participate actively and meaningfully in the decision about whether and under what conditions society is exposed to the risk. If it is unethical to foist a particular medical risk on a patient, is it not equally unethical to expose the public to a risk without first considering their opinion?

However, the proposals put forward by Bach and his colleagues were not accepted in the US. David Sachs and colleagues wrote a letter in response (Sachs et al 1998). Sachs is the Paul S Russell Professor of Surgery and Immunology at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Transplantation Biology Research Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Sachs et al agreed with Bach et al on the need for caution. However, the former group believed that local Institutional Review Boards and the FDA could adequately carry out the necessary evaluation and risk assessment for drug testing. Sachs et al also emphasised that xenotransplantation is \u2018currently seen as the most promising, near-term solution to a severe shortage of human tissues and organs\u2019 and that \u2018to convene new national bodies to consider the ramifications \u2026 would undoubtedly lead to unnecessary delays and avoidable loss of life\u2019 (Sachs et al. 1998, 372). The FDA aligned with the position advocated by Sachs and colleagues. At a conference convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in January 1998, the Acting FDA Commissioner, Michael Friedman, stated that the request for a moratorium was a \u2018highly valuable\u2019 part of public debate but added: \u2018We believe that it\u2019s important to set up a framework to responsibly conduct research\u2019 (Wadman 1998, 423).

            "text": "The arguments for and against a moratorium on xenotransplantation clinical trials attracted commentary from physicians in the US, Europe and Australia. Daniel Salomon et al, speaking on behalf of the American Society of Transplant Physicians and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, dismissed the proposals presented by Bach et al as \u2018at best, [the opinion of] a minority among US transplant professionals\u2019 (Salomon et al. 1998). They believed that Bach et al had overestimated the infectious risks associated with xenotransplant experiments. On the other hand, Peter Collignon, an infectious disease expert from Australia, went even further. In his view, a national approach was inadequate since viruses are not necessarily contained by politico-juridical borders. As such, he argued for stringent global regulation of xenotransplantation clinical trials with \u2018uniform and enforceable control procedures\u2019 (Collignon 1998, 519). He warned of the possibility of inadequate regulation of research in some jurisdictions. Collignon wrote, \u2018because of the demand for organs, countries with less stringent regulations may become havens for the performance of less regulated, and therefore more dangerous, xenotransplantation procedures\u2019 (Collignon 1998, 519). He made a compelling argument for effective regulation by underscoring the public health risks of xenotransplantation as follows:What we are collectively doing now and planning to do in the future with xenograft transplants creates the ideal conditions for animal viruses or infections to cross the species barrier into humans and proliferate \u2026 Xenotransplants thus represent one of the best experiments we could devise to \u2018create\u2019 new infectious agents. It would be somewhat paradoxical if the main legacy of modern medicine\u2019s involvement in transplantation were another infection such as HIV (Collignon 1998, 519).",

A controversy ensued over a clinical trial conducted by Dr Rafael Valdes Gonzalez at the Frederico Gomez Children\u2019s Hospital of Mexico in Mexico City. Valdes had collaborated with researchers in Canada and New Zealand. Since 2001, he has treated at least 22 minors with Type 1 diabetes - including two Canadians \u2013 with neonatal porcine islets and Sertoli cells (Armstrong 2004). These cells were placed in a collagen coated device subcutaneously implanted in the abdomen. Islet cells were combined with Sertoli cells since it is believed that the latter induces immunological tolerance. The study sought to build upon the work of Groth et al undertaken in the previous decade. Valdes et al claimed that their clinical trials produced promising results. Two patients become insulin-independent for several months. Half of the cohort experienced a \u2018significant reduction\u2019 in insulin requirements (Vald\u00e9s-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005, 419). However, upon public announcement of the study at a scientific conference in 2001, the trial attracted strong public criticisms from IXA members (McKenzie et al. 2002). A prolonged dispute took place between Valdes and IXA scientists (Valdes 2002; Sykes et al. 2006; Valdes-Gonzalez 2006). Due to pressures from the international scientific community, Mexican xenotransplantation was eventually terminated by local government authorities. By contrast to Valdes\u2019 practice, a xenotransplantation clinical trial outsourced by a New Zealand company to a research institute in Moscow was not contested by the scientific community. These trials voluntarily adhered to the guidelines issued by the FDA which included provisions for the surveillance and risk management of infectious agents (Cook et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Consistent with the global approach, permissive law on xenotransplantation was enacted in Switzerland in 1999 (Griessler 2012). Xenotransplantation is permitted subject to prior authorisation and due compliance with regulatory requirements. Swiss interests in xenotransplantation is linked to commercial investments in research made by Norvatis (formerly Sandoz). On the other hand, xenotransplantation research was also contested by political parties and NGOs including the Green Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Basel Appeal Against Genetic Engineering, Greenpeace Switzerland, Physicians against Animal Experimentation and the Swiss Animal Protection. The local public debate on xenotransplantation began in the mid-1990s. According to Griessler, \u2018the debate was neither extensive nor continuous and only of concern to a small group of informed actors from research, parliament, public administration and stakeholder organizations\u2019 (Griessler 2012: 64). A diverse range of views on xenotransplantation was canvassed in the federal parliamentary debates. Though a proposed bill banning the procedure was introduced into the Swiss parliament, it was defeated towards the end of 1999. In the following year, at the \u2018PubliForum\u2019\u2014a consensus conference on transplantation medicine\u2014a majority of lay participants affirmed their support for xenotransplantation research (Griessler 2012: 66). Notwithstanding public objections to xenotransplantation among sections of the community, the introduction of permissive laws sought to protect local research and economic interests in the Swiss pharmaceutical industry. The conflict between global science and local concerns regarding public health and patient safety have taken place in other parts of the world. As foreshadowed, I will explore comparable developments in Canada and Australia in the following two sub-sections of this paper.",

They explained their argument for public participation by drawing an analogy with the controversy over genetically modified food and referring to Hendrik Verfaille, the President of Monsanto. In his pledge for a \u2018new company,\u2019 Varfaille stated:We thought we were doing some great things. A lot of other people thought we were making some mistakes. We were blinded by our own enthusiasm. We missed the fact that this technology raises major issues for people\u2014issues of ethics, of choice, of trust, even of democracy and globalization. As we tried to understand what had happened, we realized that we needed to hear directly from people about what they thought, what their concerns were and what they thought we ought to do.

This is demonstrated by the legal suits filed by Campaign for Responsible Transplantation (CRT). CRT was established by Alix Fano in New York. It is opposed to all forms xenotransplantation. CRT has taken legal action against the FDA and contested the appointment of committee members to the Secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on Xenotransplantation (or SACX) (Bickford et al. 2005). SACX was set up by the Department of Health and Human Services to review xenotransplantation policies in the US.

PAG sought public input through two approaches: (i) an open model and (ii) a representative model (Einsiedel et al 2011b, 26\u201327). The first approach surveyed public opinion through different modes of communications including website questionnaire, stakeholder mail survey and informal feedback through letters and email. The second is based on a large telephone poll and a series of citizen jury or citizen foras. A total of 1519 Canadian participated in the telephone survey which involved answering 60 questions (Einsiedel et al 2011b, 29). PAG held six forums at regional sites across the country. Similarly to the telephone poll, invitation to attend the citizen forum was based on a random sampling process. The selection of participants was determined mainly on demographics. Over two and half days, a total of 107 participants attended presentations given by experts on different aspects of xenotransplantation. The expert panel comprised of experts in the field of transplantation, infectious diseases, law, bioethics, animal welfare and consumer health. Participants had an opportunity to pose questions to presenters and discuss matters among themselves. Data from the citizen jury was obtained through the proceedings and a participant survey. PAG concluded that when participants were provided with information, there was a greater likelihood that they would oppose xenotransplantation.",

The Canadian Standards on xenotransplantation is consistent with international guidelines including the WHA Resolution 57.18. The Canadian national inquiry was initiated because a scientist had indicated his intentions to submit an application to conduct a clinical trial involving the use of porcine cells. Thus far, no such trials have taken place in Canada (Einsiedel et al. 2011a). The Canadian public consultation on xenotransplantation was a novel social experiments in community engagement on a complex technoscience. Einsiedel et al noted that it was the first \u2018extensive deliberative consultation\u2019 undertaken by Health Canada (Einsiedel et al. 2010, 108). From their interviews with members of the Canadian public service, Jones and Einsiedel found that the xenotransplantation consultation contributed to learning about public engagement at Health Canada. While the routine of closed, expert-driven regulatory practices was destabilised, Health Canada has gone on to develop in-house infrastructure and expertise for public engagement (Jones and Einsiedel 2011). In this regard, the xenotransplantation controversy has enhanced openness and transparency in Canadian health care administration.",

James R Wright expressed his discontent with the PAG consultation in papers published in three prominent biomedical journals: Transplantation, Xenotransplantation and the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) (Wright 2002, 2003, 2004). Wright Jr described himself as \u2018a xenotransplantation researcher\u2019 and a member of the Canadian Xenotransplantation Expert Working Group (Wright 2002, 40). He identified what he considered to be three serious problems with the Canadian public consultation. Firstly, PAG failed to distinguish between different types of xenotransplantation carrying \u2018different levels of associated public health and personal risks\u2019 (Wright 2002, 40\u201341). Wright Jr argued that a tailored policy response was preferable to a blanket prohibition of all xenotransplantation clinical trials. While he acknowledged that whole organ xenotransplantation was premature, he supported (i) clinical experimentation on cellular therapies for diabetics and patients with Parkinson\u2019s diseases; and (ii) \u2018ex vivo perfusion of transgenic pig liver\u2019 for patients with terminal liver failure and without a liver donor (Wright 2002, 41).",

He argued that the overarching question was too vague and considerable variability in the outcomes from citizen forums suggested the influence of experts in the deliberations (Wright 2002, 40\u201341). He queried the suitability of some experts appointed to makes presentations to the citizen juries (Wright 2002, 41; Wright 2003, 475; Wright 2004, 1112). In addition, he was highly critical of the lack of information provided to forum participants about the Canadian standards:Personally I find the fifth recommendation bothersome, \u201cthat stringent \u2026 regulations be developed to cover all aspects of xenotransplantation clinical trials,\u201d because this regulatory framework already exists. Why did the Public Advisory Group not summarize the Proposed Canadian Standard in layperson terms and then present this? \u2026 Considering that 35 % of the \u201cno\u201d votes were qualified (i.e., not yet) and that one of the major concerns expressed by the public concerned the development of appropriate regulations, how can the results of this expensive exercise be valid when this key information was withheld?

In his view, 19 % of citizen panelists who voted a \u2018qualified no\u2019 - that is, \u2018no, not now but possibly in the future\u2019 \u2013 could be reinterpreted as \u2018not yet\u2019 (CPHA 2001, 12; Wright 2003, 476). Combing the \u2018not yet\u2019 with the \u2018qualified yes\u2019 (46 %) \u2013 that is, yes with conditions \u2013 gives a total of 65 % of participants supporting xenotransplantation. Based on this analysis of the data, Wright Jr argued that \u2018approximately two-thirds of \u2018meaningfully\u2019 informed Canadians support xenotransplantation as a possible future treatment, but only if its safety and efficacy can be demonstrated\u2019 (Wright 2003, 476). Wright decried the separation of the \u2018qualified yes\u2019 and \u2018qualified no\u2019 as \u2018blatantly invalid\u2019 (Wright 2004, 1113). However, the above argument posed by Wright Jr is not entirely new. It was raised in relation to an earlier discussion on the results from an Australian survey on patient attitudes towards xenotransplantation. In that instance, Mohacsi et al responded to their critics from the sciences by reminding readers that \u2018the data are not in dispute, merely their interpretation (Mohacsi et al. 1998, 41). The exchange between Wright and social scientists over public opinion data has been aptly described as \u2018a war over publics\u2019 (Tallachini 2011, 181).",

Her article focused on a local study led by Bernie Tuch, Professor of Medicine at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Tuch and his colleagues were based at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. They had obtained approval from the ethics committe of the South-Eastern Sydney Area Health Service (SESAHS) to conduct a small pilot study involving the use of pig islets to treat diabetes. The cells were obtained from \u2018a special herd of pigs\u2019 screened to ensure that their cells were free of pathogens (Smith 2000a). Tuch and his colleagues had demonstrated that pig cells could normalise blood glucose in diabetic pigs. Two days later, however, Smith provided an update on the study as an unfolding controversy. Ron Pirola, Chairman of the SESAHS ethics committee, disclosed that his committee \u2018spent years deliberating\u2019 over the UNSW application (Smith 2000b). He noted that NHMRC had been notified through-out the process of ethics review and that a risk management strategy was adopted to closely monitor patients once the trials began. Bernadette Tobin, Director of the John Plunkett Centre for Ethics in Health Care in Sydney, and a member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee (AHEC), called into question the safety and efficacy of the trial. She argued that research ethics was \u2018a matter of significance to the community and not just to the people who will benefit from the research\u2019 (Smith 2000b). Similarly, local and overseas virologists warned of the risk of cross-species infection. Peter Collignon, an infectious disease physician at the Canberra Hospital, commented, \u2018Theoretically, there is a major public health risk.\u2019 He proposed that \u2018the trial should be halted, at least until Australia has national safety guidelines on animal tissue transplants in place\u2019 (Smith 2000b).",

The decision by NHMRC to intervene coincided with a decision to terminate a xenotransplantation program conducted in Edinburgh. On 13th August 2000, the Scottish media reported that Geron Bio-Med Ltd had halted funding on genetically-modified pig experiments, carried out at the Roslin Institute. Their decision was motivated by concerns over potential retroviral infection (Peterkin 2000). Shortly thereafter, the risk of PERV infection was underscored by results from a mice study published in Nature. The editors reported that researchers at the Scripps Research Institute in California demonstrated that \u2018transplanting pig pancreatic islets into immunosuppressed mice leads to widespread infection with PERV\u2019 (Editorial 2000, 661).",

An Animal Issues Sub-Committee (AIS) was formed to address the issue of animal ethics, animal welfare and the use of animals in experimental transplantation (XWP 2003a, para 1.18).

A plain English guide on xenotransplantation was prepared to provide accessible information for the general public (XWP 2003b). The XWP set out its responses to the initial consultation in a second discussion paper (XWP 2003a). Though the Working Partying acknowledged that xenotransplantation was highly contested, it concluded that \u2018there are no significant in-principle ethical objections to the use of live organs and tissues from animals for human therapies, that would preclude any further research to develop such therapies\u2019 (emphasis in the original) (XWP 2003a, para 12.8). It reiterated a position it adopted in the previous consultation. That is, xenotransplantation clinical trials should be allowed to proceed \u2018if there are clear potential benefits, both for individual patients and for the general public\u2019 (XWP 2003a, para 12.15). The draft guidelines were revised to incorporate two new topics: animal welfare and patient selection. The additional guidelines required research protocols to specify clear information on the criteria for patient selection (proposed Guideline 4) (XWP 2003a, 158).

After the second round of meetings, Jack Sparrow, the second Chairperson of the XWP, made general comments on public responses in an interview on national radio. Sparrow reported that transplant recipients and patients on waiting lists, and their families supported xenotransplantation (Beaumont and Noble 2004, 3). However, he also added that \u2018Australians are more fearful about the use of living animal material in humans than they were 18 months ago as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and bird flu outbreaks overseas\u2019 (Reuters News 2004). The Working Party received a total of 343 written submissions from respondents in Australia and overseas (XWP 2004, 4).

This study surveyed 1500 people from all states and territories (Anderson 2004, 14). On the other hand, the Australian Association for Humane Research (AAHR) presented a contrary perspective based on the outcomes of a Newspoll survey they commissioned. Newspoll interviewed 1200 adults in late May 2004. The survey revealed that only 5 % of interviewees knew what xenotransplantation was and 31 % did not think that the process should be approved for clinical trials (The Mercury 2004, 6). AAHR reported that the three most common reasons for opposing xenotransplantation included \u2018the belief that it is unethical \u2026 that humans and animals are too different \u2026 and that it is dangerous to human health\u2019 (AAHR 2004). Given the lack of public awareness about xenotransplanation, AAHR concluded that the education campaign conducted by XWP was ineffective and the approval of xenotransplantation clinical trials would place \u2018the Australian public at risk without their knowledge and informed consent\u2019 (AAHR 2004).",

They also recommended that cellular and external xenogeneic therapies should be given an \u2018extremely cautious \u201cgreen light\u201d if such trials were strictly regulated in Australia.\u2019 However, in response to both proposals, Council decided otherwise. In its subsequent Communique, Council declared that \u2018there should be no clinical trials in Australia using animal cellular therapies or animal therapies for 5 years\u2019 (National Health Medical Research Council NHMRC 2004b).\u2019 In a follow-up media release issued on 10th March 2005, the NHMRC Council explained that its decision to ban all forms of xenotransplantation was made on the basis that the \u2018risks of transmission of animal viruses to transplant recipients and the wider community had not been adequately resolved. In addition, xenotransplantation research was at an early stage and clinical trials in the foreseeable future were unlikely to be of significant benefit to research participants\u2019 (National Health Medical Research Council NHMRC 2005). The only exception to the moratorium appeared to be the established practice of culturing human skin tissue on \u2018feeder layers of irradiated mouse cells\u2019 to treat burn patients (National Health Medical Research Council NHMRC 2005).

It maintains that a \u2018community decision\u2019 is necessary since \u2018it will be the general public that will pay the ultimate penalty for any fallout\u2019 (Australian Association for Humane Research 2009). Sociologist, Peta Cook, noted that \u2018all forms of ctXTP [clinical xenotransplantation] are now theoretically possible in Australia (subject to ethical approval)\u2019 (Cook 2014, 681). She argued that the public was marginalised and their diverse knowledge devalued because the public consultation conducted by the XWP did not facilitate \u2018meaningful public engagement\u2019 (Cook 2011, 67). At the same time, however, she also acknowledged that public input had a bearing on government decision-making. Cook wrote,this decision [ie placing a 5-year moratorium on all forms of clinical xenotransplantation] was informed by community concerns and the scientific uncertainty surround zoonosis \u2026 and social anxieties regarding animal welfare and use \u2026 this outcome suggests that the NHMRC respects the community and the issues that they raised, the lifting of the moratorium on 10 December 2009 suggests otherwise\u2019 (Cook 2014, 681).",

This paper was based on an expert consultation involving NHMRC staff and invited guests. On 8th August 2008, the NHMRC held a workshop at its Head Office in Canberra to review xenotransplantation research in Australia. The workshop was attended by experts from Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US (National Health Medical Research Council NHMRC 2009b, 36). Though the Australian moratorium was not intended to impede pre-clinical xenotransplantation research, the Discussion Paper noted some unanticipated adverse consequences. The moratorium delayed the development of regulatory guidelines and research infrastructure such as the building of \u2018containment facilities for source pigs\u2019 (National Health Medical Research Council NHMRC 2009b, 9). The discussion paper concluded,\u2026 the consensus is that the risk posed by animal viruses is low and can be managed via herd selection and screening strategies provided there is a regulatory mechanism to obligate compliance. In reality, the risks of novel infection is more likely to be greater with allotransplantation compared with xenotransplantation as human donors are not screened or held in specialised containment facilities (National Health Medical Research Council NHMRC 2009b, 22\u201323).",

Alternatively put, screening can only prevent an outbreak of contagion where an effective test for a known disease agent has been developed and incorporated into routine surveillance procedures. The shortcomings of existing risks management strategies have already been demonstrated in allotransplantation. To further elaborate on the limitations of current screening practices, I will now turn to consider some incidences involving experimental and routine allograft in the final part of this paper.",

In 2000, James Shapiro and colleagues reinvigorated the field of islet transplantation when they announced positive results from their study involving seven type 1 diabetes patients. Shapiro is Professor of Surgery, Medicine and Surgical Oncology and the Director of the Clinical Islet Transplant Program at the University of Alberta. Subsequently called the \u2018Edmonton Protocol\u2019, his approach introduced a steroid-free immunosuppression regime coupled with the implantation of a large number of islets from multiple donors (Shapiro et al. 2000). This protocol attracted worldwide interest transforming islet transplantation into a viable clinical procedure. Chisholm et al summarised the key findings from the Edmonton study as follows:Independence from insulin injections was initially achieved in about 80 % of patients at 1 year post-transplant and significant reduction in hypoglycaemia unawareness. Five years after islet transplantation \u2026 the majority of patients (around 80 %) have c-peptide present, indicating insulin production, but only a minority (around 10 %) maintain insulin independence. Those who resumed insulin therapy required half of their pre-transplant insulin dose. Hypoglycaemic score improved significantly post-transplant, and was maintained over 5 years. Fifty percent of patients demonstrated stabilisation or improvement of their diabetic neuropathy. A recent long term follow up has confirmed that transplant recipients also report a significantly increased quality of life (Chisholm et al. 2010, 31).",

The program received US$144 million to begin its research activities in mid-2000 (Associated Press Newswire 2000). The aim of the ITN is the development of new immune tolerance therapies. In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton launched the first international multi-centre study funded under the ITN. The study involved nine research centres located in the US, Canada and Europe. Robert Goldstein, Chief Scientific Officer of the JDRF commented, \u2018The ITN is an intellectual powerhouse. It is exciting to see so many world-leaders working together with a single goal in mind\u2019 (Associated Press Newswire 2000). Four years later at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Diabetes Association in Florida, Shapiro announced the outcomes of the ITN study.

The enzyme was manufactured in the US by Roche Applied Science. Canadian journalist, Jodie Sinnema, reported that a Roche supplier used fat tissue from cow brains to enhance the growth of bacteria producing the enzyme. At the time, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) had been identified in the US and there were a small number of reported cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Commonly known as brain-wasting disease, CJD is an incurable and fatal neuro-degenerative disorder. Variant CJD (vCJD), one type of neurological condition, is caused by the consumption of beef products infected with BSE or mad cow disease. The materiality of the risk of contamination was underscored by the prior incidences of patient death due to various medical procedures. Since the late 1960s, patients have contracted CJD following corneal graft, dura mater transplant,16 and the administration of human-derived pituitary growth hormones (Magnusson 2006).",

Neil Cashman, clinical neurologist and neuroscientist from the University of British Columbia, expressed strong criticisms about the technical mishap.Products made out of cattle brain, it\u2019s medieval. I find it distressing that there are still products like this that Dr Shapiro would use in his protocols without even knowing about it. The diabetes program at U of A is world-renowned. To find out at this stage that the enzyme is grown in bacteria that are exposed to cow brain is really distressing (Sinnema 2007).",

Seven years later, a Victorian Coroner issued her report into the cause of patient deaths in May 2013 (Coroners Court of Victoria 2013a, 2013b, 2013c). The transplant donor had travelled to Serbia for 3 months where he visited his mother and resided at a rural property. Upon his return to Australia, the patient became ill experiencing considerable weight loss. He died of a brain haemorrhage in early December 2006. Experts speculated that the donor may have contracted a virus while abroad (Anderson 2013). They identified the agent as a novel virus comparable to an arenavirus known as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (Palacios et al. 2008). Since 2003, LCMV has been linked to several clusters of patient deaths following transplantation in four states in the US (Singh et al. 2013). This virus is contracted through exposure to rodents including rats, mice and hamsters. LCMV infection generally causes mild flu-like symptoms in immunocompetent patients. However, in the case of immunosuppressed patients, it may result in serious symptoms such as encephalitis, an acute inflammation of the brain.",

There are no possible safeguards against unknown diseases. Neither are there safeguards where an effective test for known diseases has yet to be designed and implemented in the screening procedure. In addition to the cases of LCMV and LCMV-like arenavirus, other infections found in organ recipients include parasites, rabies, HIV, West Nile virus, Chagas\u2019 disease, herpes simplex virus and hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (Fishman and AST Infectious Diseases Community of Practice 2009). Thus, similarly to the practice of xenotransplantation, patients seeking an organ transplant bear the risk of contracting an infectious disease which cannot be identified through the existing screening processes. Moreover, the incidence has catalysed a debate as to whether Australia should introduce a policy to inform patients of the variability of organ quality (Sunday Age 2013). The surviving partner of one of the deceased patients remarked that she and her partner would have thought twice about the transplant operation if they were aware that the donated kidney was \u2018borderline\u2019 (Elder 2013).",

It is highly likely that the transplantation of a partial human pancreas, performed by Sir John Ramsay in Tasmania in 1911, was the first allograft of its kind in the world. Similarly, as noted above, Frederick Banting attempted canine tissue transplantation following his successful research on insulin. More recently, aside from the continuation of scientific research in both countries, Canada and Australia have also been the subject of social science investigations for its national responses on xenotransplantation. Due to the anticipation of xenotransplantation clinical trials by Canadian and Australian researchers, both jurisdictions responded with initiatives to engage the public in policy decision-making. For both countries, the outcome was a mix of the local and global as well as a fusion of technical expertise and lay perspectives concerning human experimentation and the use of animal bodies for biomedical experimentation. Towards the end of 1997, Canada began to \u2018systematically\u2019 undertake a national public consultation on xenotransplantation to address public health risks and the associated \u2018socio-ethical, legal and scientific challenges\u2019 (Einsiedel and Ross 2002, 589). Canadian scholars, Einsiedel and Ross argued that the process of public consultation substantively contributed to the Canadian debate on xenotransplantation in two ways: firstly, it facilitated the \u2018pluralisation of knowledge\u2019 by allowing marginalised voices to be heard; and secondly, it offered the public an opportunity to consider the risks and benefits of a technology with experts (Einsiedel and Ross 2002, 589). Following a national public consultation, Canada effectively prioritised the role of the public by delaying the introduction of its standards for clinical xenotransplantation.",

Einsiedel et al suggested the lack of an articulated policy could be read as in itself a \u2018decision\u2019 (Einsiedel et al. 2011b, 43). Though a non-decision is highly ambiguous, it may also be the only workable or realistic position to adopt given that the field is constrained by uncertainty regarding the risks of infectious diseases. The introduction of the Canadian xenotransplantation standards has been criticised for undermining public health concerns and inconsistency with the principal recommendation from the national consultation (Mortensen 2005, 53). However, in the absence of an explicit policy commitment to a moratorium with a fixed duration, it could be argued that the Canadian approach was sufficiently pliable to accommodate competing national priorities for public safety and the promotion of biotechnological innovation. Xenotransplantation has been less of a contested political issue in Canada than in the US and UK where opponents have contested the research in the law courts (Einsiedel et al. 2011b). In addition, the Canadian public engagement on xenotransplantation also facilitated institutional learning about the role of the public and public participation in policy-making within Health Canada (Jones and Einsiedel 2011).",

Australian scientists are among the most active researchers in transplantation medicine. They also participate in the development of global and local regulatory standards for clinical xenotransplantation. The Australian national inquiry on xenotransplantation took place after comparable inquiries were completed in other jurisdictions. As such, it was in a position to draw upon and learn from the experiences of other countries including Canada. In 2009, the NHMRC shifted from a precautionary approach to permissive regulation of xenotransplantation consistent with policies adopted in other developed countries including Canada, New Zealand, United States and the European Union. Though the NHMRC has indicated that it has issued guidelines for \u2018animal to human studies,\u2019 this document do not appear to be available on their website. Within a consensual model of decision-making, Australian efforts to engage in experimental democracy appear to become un-done when competing national priorities for scientific innovation took precedence in 2009. As noted above, there are conflicting views as to whether or not public consultation was necessary or required before the lifting of the national ban (Xenotransplantation Working Party XWP 2004; National Health Medical Research Council NHMRC 2009b). A subsequent public consultation did not take place in Canada. However, unlike Canadian social science research, no comparable empirical research has been conducted to assess whether or not there has been institutional learning regarding the importance of public participation in the development of health and research policy at the NHMRC.",

As note above, the Australian ban on clinical xenotransplantation coincided with the JDRF moratorium on islet allotransplantation in 2007. These incidences illustrate that the risk of infectious diseases is problematic not only in xenotransplantation but also in allotransplantation. Stringent measures are necessary to regulate both experimental and routine transplantation. Ironically, the ban on xenotransplantation clinical trials provided protection for patients in a way which was not available to transplant recipients and research participants receiving islet allografts under the Edmonton Protocol. In its 2009 report on xenotransplantation, the NHMRC omitted a discussion on the JDRF global moratorium in the context of islet allograft. Yet, allotransplantation is also an important point of comparison for its analysis of xenotransplantation. As noted above, the NHMRC paper articulated the claim that \u2018xenograft may be safer than allograft\u2019 (National Health Medical Research Council NHMRC 2009b, 21). In its support of clinical xenotransplantation, NHMRC advocated the practice of screening source pigs and monitoring for infectious diseases without addressing the limitations of such procedures. Due to the possibility of human error, a rigorous and robust approach on the regulation of clinical xenotransplantation would also need to take account of potential accidents and inadvertence. British biochemist and Nobel laureate, Richard Roberts, made the obvious point succinctly, \u2018Humans are human. People make mistakes\u2019 (Sample 2014, 32). With the expiry of the xenotransplantation moratorium in Canada, Australia and elsewhere, it remains to be seen how clinical research in this field will unfold and whether developments in virology will have a bearing on the future trajectory of experimental transplantation as has been the case in the past.",
