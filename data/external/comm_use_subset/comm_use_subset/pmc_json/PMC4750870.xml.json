Second only to rodents in numbers of living genera and species, bats comprise one of the most diverse and ecologically important groups of mammals, with ~1,200 species, accounting for almost a quarter of mammal diversity worldwide [8]. Additionally, studies have found that the life history traits of bats compared to other mammals may make then unique and exceptional hosts for viruses [9, 10]. This possible \u201cuniqueness\u201d of bats to harbor viral pathogens has led to an increased interest in understanding viral diversity and viral richness in bats [9\u201314].",

However, despite the importance of discovering and characterizing novel bat pathogens, at an individual study level most of these efforts have been opportunistic or ad hoc in the taxonomic groups and viruses examined. To date, there has been no concerted effort to collate and analyze the methods and findings from these disparate studies using a quantitative approach. Here, we synthesize and analyze patterns of viral discovery in bats from recently published data with the aim of creating a more systematic and efficient approach to identifying novel pathogens. We analyze data from 93 peer-reviewed papers from 2007\u20132013 using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and other approaches to assess the \u2018success\u2019 of viral discovery, as well as the probability of detecting a positive sample at an individual level. We identify the study-level variables and methodologies most important for efficient viral discovery, such as specimen type, number of bats sampled, assays used, and bat and viral taxonomy, and explore possible routes of viral shedding and prevalence levels by viral family. We explore several overarching questions, including: what are the overall trends in bat viral discovery over the time period; how many novel viruses were detected over the study period; is viral discovery biased by host or viral taxonomy; what specimen types are most likely to yield specific viruses; and does lethal vs. non-lethal sampling affect the probability of viral detection or the composition of the viral communities discovered?",

We assembled a database of study level variables for each of the 93 studies that included descriptive statistics, including species of bats collected, viruses found, specimens taken, and viral detection methods used (S1 and S2 Datasets). We compiled a separate database with individual data points, where each record in our database (2,565 rows) represented a unique interaction between a virus, host species, sample type, and assay used (S2 Dataset). This data structure allowed us to test the probability of detecting a given virus or viral family by sample type, host taxonomy, and other study-level traits.",

In three instances, the number of individual bats that tested positive for a virus was not reported, and multiple specimens were positive in multiple species [17\u201319]. In these cases, we assumed an equal distribution of positive individuals across species. When the total number of bats was not explicitly stated but organ tissue specimens were taken, the total number of bats was assumed to be the total number of specimens [20\u201324]. When it was not explicitly stated whether the bats captured were lethally sampled, contextual clues were used to assume whether they were or were not sacrificed (e.g., if organ tissue was collected, it was assumed the animals were sacrificed unless explicitly stated that organ biopsies were non-lethal). To address the possibility of sharing of samples among research groups, comparisons were made of authors lists as well as descriptions of the data, including year(s) collected, location collected, and number of specimens collected. Where stated, it was noted whether samples were from archival tissues. Studies that used the same specimens or subsets of specimens were identified and removed. Finally, bats that were found already dead or dying were categorized as non-lethal sampling. This occurred in fifteen studies, with the majority of cases being samples taken from bats that had been found and taken to rehabilitation centers and subsequently died.",

After testing for collinearity among the response variables in the study-level data, the total number of individual bats in a study was excluded from the model due to its covariance with the number of bat species (r = 0.70, p<0.0001) and the number of specimens tested (r = 0.92, p<0.0001). Explanatory variables included in the full study-level model were: number of species tested, proportion of bats sacrificed, number of total specimens in the study, and number of viral families tested in the study (Table 1). Potential confounders such as seasonality were not addressed in our models, as our analysis was limited to raw data from published studies, and most studies did not include the date of collection of individual specimens in their analyses. Backward stepwise methods for variable selection were used along with ranking by Akaike information criterion (AIC) values to identify the best models [26]. We checked model-fitting assumptions using goodness of fit tests including: likelihood ratio \u03c72 tests to assess whether the restricted model fit the data as well as the full model; examination of residual versus fitted value and Q-Q plots; and assessing estimates and confidence intervals for odds ratios for each model (data not shown).",

However, we identify significant surveillance biases over this period, and highlight these taxonomic gaps as opportunities for future research in the coming decade.

This later observation is a likely driven by a combination of both differences in host species richness and host abundance and feasibility of capture (e.g. Vespertilionidae bats are the second largest mammalian family and geographically the most widespread bat family [8]), but it may also reflect inherent differences in viral richness among bat species based on life history and ecological traits [9, 28, 29].",

Existing platforms, e.g. Luminex and LIPS assays, should be expanded to include novel pathogens recently discovered in bats that are of high interest [31, 32]. However, serological testing to detect certain viruses in bats should be interpreted with caution, as there are several potential limitations to serological assays. Most notably, cross-reactivity of antibodies to multiple pathogens can lead to decreased assay specificity and confounding results for closely related viruses [33].

Notably, both the proportion of bats sacrificed and the number of specimens examined both dropped out of the final fitted model when both the number of total and novel viruses were used as response variables. This suggests that viral discovery efforts will be maximized by including more species of bats, instead of (or in addition to) more specimens of individuals from the same bat species. While not an entirely novel finding, these data suggest that we have not yet saturated the bat viral discovery curve for most species. This was demonstrated by intensive sampling in a single species of bat (Pteropus giganteus) which produced the discovery of 55 viruses from seven viral families, and showed that nearly 7,000 specimens are required to fully saturate the viral discovery curve for that species [34]. While Anthony et al. collected over 2,000 specimens over four years; less than 20% of the studies in our analysis had sample sizes greater than 1,000. While the intensive approach of longitudinal sampling and collection of thousands of specimens might be ideal for quantifying the total diversity of viruses in a bat species, our findings suggests that for studies without extensive resources, including more species of bats and testing a broader number of viral families alone are efficient ways to discover more viruses.",

Our raw data showed that a greater number of viruses were found in studies that did not sacrifice bats, with a few exceptions, including Filoviruses and Orthomyxoviruses. However, this is likely due to bias in surveillance methods to date; for example, most Filovirus studies we examined did not attempt to screen non-lethally collected bat excreta. Recent data from experimental studies show that Marburg virus is shed in the saliva of Rousettus sp. bats [35], which points to a non-lethal specimen type that may be productive for Filovirus detection and discovery in the future. Our findings suggest that the use of recently developed protocols for non-lethal sampling for pathogen discovery may be valuable (33, 34), and global efforts that have adopted these methods for wildlife viral discovery may find success in their efforts (35).",

The broadest ranges of viruses were tested for in tissue specimens (20/24 viral families), and while we recognize that all tissues types are not likely to yield the same viral communities, due to the structure and availability of individual-level data, we pooled all tissue types when collating the data presented here.

This sampling bias will only be fixed with more targeted efforts in the field and laboratory to address these surveillance gaps. Notably, many of the viral families in our analysis have been targeted because of their public health significance, i.e. the increase in coronavirus research after the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and thus are over-represented in our dataset relative to other viral groups. The use of novel and unbiased methods such as NGS and VirCapSeq-VERT, aimed at detecting all mammalian viruses, will help elucidate more unbiased patterns of viral patterns between bat species and across global bat populations [39].",
