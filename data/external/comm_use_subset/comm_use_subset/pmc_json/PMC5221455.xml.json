Specifically, they take role in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. They also recruit regulatory proteins associated with pathways related to DNA and RNA metabolism 27, 28. Being targeted by multiple viruses, HNRPU was reported as a hotspot of viral infection, and proposed as a potential antiviral human protein 4. In the present study, HNRPU is found to be targeted by five viral families (see Data S3). Our data additionally indicate several other HNRPs, targeted by viral proteins (see Data S1\u2013S3). For all virus\u2010targeted HNRPs, the number of targeting RNA virus families is found to be higher than that of DNA virus families (see Data S3), revealing that they may play crucial roles in viral RNA processing.

IMA1 (Karyopherin alpha 2, KPNA2) functions mainly in nuclear import as an adapter protein for nuclear receptor KPNB1 (Karyopherin beta 1). Interacting with IMA1 enables viruses to enter the nucleus and consequently to use the host's transcriptional machinery. Besides, viruses may interact with IMA1 in order to inhibit the host antiviral response, since nuclear import factors regulate the transport of innate immune regulatory proteins to the nucleus of cells to activate the antiviral response 3, 29, 30, 31. The transmembrane transporter activity of ADT2 is responsible for the exchange of cytoplasmic ADP with mitochondrial ATP across the mitochondrial membrane, serving crucial roles in metabolic processes 32. Attacking to human metabolic processes was reported as a common infection strategy of bacteria and viruses 15. The proteins, TCPG and TCPE are responsible for RNA localization activity and our results reveal that they are targeted by larger number of RNA families (Table 4).

YBOX1 functions in transcription of numerous genes, as a transcription factor. It also contributes to the regulation of translation. On the other hand, P53 is the famous tumor supressor acting as an activator for apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis is a very crucial process during the viral infection progress, and should be strategically controlled by viruses for a successful viral infection. Apoptosis is an innate immune response to viral infection. In the early stage of viral life cycle in the host cell, apoptosis is inhibited by corresponding virus\u2013human protein interactions. After completion of transcription and translation of viral genetic material, viruses try to induce apoptosis to assist virus dissemination 37, 38, 39.",
