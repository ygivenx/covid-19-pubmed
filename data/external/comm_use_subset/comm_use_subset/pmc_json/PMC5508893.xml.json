The identification of such etiological agents would serve to better target preventive (i.e., vaccination) and curative measures (i.e., antibiotics and antiviral drugs), reducing the global burden of hypoxemia and pneumonia. Because of its high incidence and related mortality, particular attention must be paid to hypoxemic pneumonia in developing countries. Pulse oximetry is still rarely available in health-care settings of developing countries.5 In the absence of oximeter, hypoxemia can be detected by several clinical signs or symptoms, including cyanosis and increased respiratory rate. However, none is sensitive and specific enough to reliably detect hypoxemia.6\u20138 Most studies of hypoxemia in children with pneumonia were performed in one country and rarely investigated the relationship between hypoxemia and microbiological results, so it would be useful to reassess them in a more recent multicontinental investigation.2",

Quantitative variables were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared by the Mann\u2013Whitney U test or Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way analysis of variance. Positive likelihood (LR+) and negative likelihood (LR\u2212) ratios of various clinical signs and symptoms were calculated to detect hypoxemic cases with the following formulae: LR+ = sensitivity/(1 \u2212 specificity) and LR\u2212 = (1 \u2212 sensitivity)/specificity. It has been underlined that LR calculation is useful to improve diagnostic accuracy.16 LR could thus express the proportion of hypoxemic children who presented a particular sign or symptom divided by the proportion of non-hypoxemic children with the same result.",

            "text": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is recognized as the main etiological agent of severe pneumonia and death from pneumonia in children.25 The diagnosis of pneumococcus pneumonia is, however, difficult at the individual level, because of the low sensitivity of blood culture, particularly in case of previous exposure to antibiotics. In addition, the clinical meaning of pneumococcus detection in nasal samples by molecular testing is difficult to interpret because of the high prevalence of S. pneumoniae respiratory carriage in asymptomatic children.26 We did not observe associations between pneumococcus detection in nasal samples and disease severity, although pneumococcus-positive blood PCR was linked with greater mortality. Molecular S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR is thus helpful in identifying bacterial pneumonia cases with the poorest prognosis who might need intensive therapies. Interpretation of molecular methods, such as PCR, to identify the etiology of pneumonia in children is, however, challenging. Respiratory viruses can be identified in asymptomatic children, and secondary bacterial infections in the lungs can easily be missed by these methods. In addition, identification of S. pneumoniae in blood by highly sensitive PCR may detect children with nasopharyngeal colonization only, which could lead to potential misclassification bias, particularly when using results of nasopharyngeal specimens to determine the etiology of pneumonia in children. We must be cautious with results interpretation. Moreover, PCT was the major biomarker associated with in-hospital death in our cohort. Several studies previously found an association between PCT and the risk of death or bacterial disease.27\u201330 However, such linkage has rarely been seen in pneumonia-infected children living in developing countries.",

            "text": "The main strength of the present study is the prospective data collection on a standardized form at different sites, with advanced molecular diagnosis in all cases, which reinforces internal validity. Its main limitations include paucity of information on exposures before hospital admission (i.e., breastfeeding, food intake, or vitamin supplementation). In addition, microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult because sensitive and specific tests are not routinely available in practice. Thus, based on respiratory samples, we were unable to differentiate colonization from infection, particularly by S. pneumoniae.31 However, analysis of the relationship between results from different samples and severity was contributive: we did not find associations between nasal colonization by pneumococcus and disease severity, hypoxemia, or death. Finally, selection bias might have occurred because of patient recruitment in hospital with inclusion of more severe cases or patients with easier access to care. However, we did not discern significant heterogeneity regarding SO2 of infants at admission and in-hospital mortality, which suggests that the results might be generalizable to different settings. We must acknowledge that 41% of the study population was enrolled in two sites from India, which might limit external validity. This proportion is, however, in accordance with estimates of global pneumonia incidence and related mortality: India might have accounted for almost 30% of the total number of severe pneumonia cases in children and 40% of the number of deaths worldwide.25",

Viral etiology might be considered in hypoxemic patients, whereas in very severe pneumonia, which can lead to death, S. pneumoniae may be implicated as the primary cause, even in the absence of hypoxemia at admission. Tachypnea and lower chest indrawing could be useful indicators of possible hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy. Pulse oximetry should be included for better diagnosis in developing countries. Given these findings, preventive measures, such as increased vaccination coverage of children in developing countries, oxygen therapy of hypoxemic patients, and intensive cardiovascular support, even in non-hypoxemic patients, would reduce the burden of death by pneumonia in children.",
