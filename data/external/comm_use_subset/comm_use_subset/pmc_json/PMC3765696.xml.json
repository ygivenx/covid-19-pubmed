Outbreaks occurred on its islands including the Malay Archipelago as well as in several tropical African countries [1-3]. Alphaviruses express a capsid protein (CP) as part of a polyprotein which, after autoproteolytic cleavage by its protease activity, forms viral particles and packages the viral genomic RNA [3]. Although being small enough (approx. 30 kDa) for passive transport through nuclear pores, some alphaviral capsid proteins are reported to harbor a nuclear localization signal (NLS) with the protein\u2019s transport being energy dependent [4,5].",

            "text": "In general, bidirectional transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a supra-molecular structure of the nuclear envelope [6]. NPCs allow passive diffusion of ions and small proteins up to a molecular weight of 40 kDa or less than 9 nm in diameter, but restrict passage of larger molecules to those containing an appropriate targeting signal [7]. Protein traffic into the nucleus is mediated by the interaction of transport cargoes with karyopherins. Karyopherins are adaptor proteins that recognize cargo to be conveyed via a NLS which also interacts with the transport receptor importin \u03b2. Together, these proteins form a ternary bundle that conjointly translocates into the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex [8]. NLS motifs used by the classical nuclear import pathway consist of a short stretch of the positively charged amino acids (aa) arginine and lysine but lack strict consensus sequences [9]. A monopartite NLS like that of SV40 large T-antigen is composed of a cluster of five to seven basic aa, while a typical bipartite NLS contains two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a linker of 10\u201311 aa [10-12]. Nuclear export signals (NES) are recognized by exportins and allow proteins to be actively carried from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the NPC [13]. NES are specifically bound by exportin known as exportin 1 or Chromosomal Region Maintenance 1 (CRM1). This transport is mediated via binding to the GTP-bound form of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ran. The most commonly identified NES are short leucine-rich stretches, although other hydrophobic residues such as isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, and valine can also contribute to this entity [14].",

As nuclear and cytoplasmic trafficking of the viral CP may also play a role in the CHIKV life cycle, we have sought to identify a NLS and, consequently, looked for a nuclear export signal (NES) in the CHIKV CP. Here, we demonstrate that CHIKV CP binds to karyopherin \u03b1 (Kar\u03b1) for its nuclear translocation, and that the Kar\u03b14 C-terminal NLS binding domain is sufficient for this interaction. We also show that CHIKV CP contains a CRM1-mediated NES, which is mapped to a leucine rich region between amino acids 143 and 155 and docks similar to snurportin-1 CRM1 complex in silico. Applying virus-free methods, we demonstrate that CHIKV CP contains motifs enabling it to actively shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.",

            "text": "Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is a well-studied Old World alphavirus and its capsid protein is reported to have an N-terminal NLS [4,15]. To validate the role of the corresponding region in CHIKV CP, the putative NLS containing sequence was cloned in fusion with EGFP and HEK293 were transfected with pNLS-EGFP. As shown in Figure 1A and B, the NLS-EGFP fusion protein was quantitatively imported to the nucleus with 5.48 times (\u00b1 1.41) higher nuclear accumulation when compared to the control EGFP expression (1.59 \u00b1 0.42 times nuclear). As in other alphaviruses, a substantial amount of CP was seen in nucleoli [4]. Karyopherins are known to directly interact in the cytoplasm with proteins bearing a NLS and to carry these through nuclear pores into the nucleus. To investigate possible mechanisms of CHIKV CP nuclear translocation, we analyzed the interactions of this protein with various karyopherins. Recombinant CHIKV CP was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein and purified using the Ni-NTA column system. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with various FLAG-tagged karyopherins (Kar\u03b11-4) were lyzed and incubated with the purified CHIKV CP. Pull-down assays revealed that the viral CP interacts strongly and specifically with Kar\u03b14 (Figure 2A, lane 4). To confirm the observed interaction between CHIKV CP and Kar\u03b14, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-Kar\u03b14 and CHIKV-CP-EGFP. Cells were lysed and the protein complex was co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with an anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Figure 2B, the band detected in lane 4 indicated that CHIKV CP co-immunoprecipitates with Kar\u03b14. The experiment was performed five times and similar results were obtained each time. No binding was observed in the control experiments using only beads or a non-specific antibody.",

            "text": "Kar\u03b1 molecules contain two NLS binding sites that directly recognize NLS sequences of cargo proteins. The primary NLS binding site is located at the N-terminal arm (alpha helices that form a hairpin structure) repeats 2 to 4, while the secondary NLS binding site is located at the C-terminal arm repeats 7 to 9 (Figure 3A). The NLS major binding site is involved in the interaction with monopartite NLS, while the minor binding site associates with bipartite NLS. The acidic residues of the binding site undergo electrostatic interactions with positively charged functional groups of basic amino acids in NLS peptide regions. The hydrophobic chains of basic residues, like lysine and arginine in the NLS peptide, also form hydrophobic interactions with conserved residues of the binding site [16-19]. To further characterize the specific mechanism of CHIKV CP binding to Kar\u03b14 molecule, we created the deletion mutant Kar\u03b14\u0394259, which lacks the minor binding site, and analyzed whether this region is required for the interaction with CHIKV CP by pull-down assay. Indeed, Kar\u03b14\u0394259 was able to interact with CHIKV CP both alone (Figure 3B, lane 5), and in the presence of excess full-length Kar\u03b14 (Kar\u03b14-FL) protein (Figure 3B, lane 6). This demonstrates that CP binds to the Kar\u03b14 NLS major binding site. One can conclude that CHICKV CP and Kar\u03b14 binding occurs as a monopartite NLS-driven interaction.",

Deletion of 46 aa from the C-terminus did not have any effect on the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation process, as the truncated protein was distributed throughout the cell (Figure 5B and C). Next, the region between aa 143 and 155 that is rich in leucine residues was examined as a potential NES site. This stretch of amino acids is highly conserved among Old World alphavirus isolates (Figure 6A). Structural analysis revealed that this region can form a protruding ridge (Figure 6B) to make it accessible for binding to the CRM1 protein. The domain that consists of a pi-helix and a loop can be flexible in solution and thus, may fold to dock with the CRM1 binding site. A larger C-terminal deletion of 118 aa removed this potential NES and rendered the mutant EGFP fusion protein highly nuclear (6.43 \u00b1 1.91 times more nuclear; Figure 5B and C). To further characterize the NES, two leucine residues at aa positions 149 and 152 were exchanged against alanine by means of an overlap PCR. Expression of the altered protein designated NES mutant resulted in a significant decrease of cytoplasmic localization (5.57 \u00b1 1.67 times more nuclear; Figure 5B and C). These results provide evidence that the region between aa 149 and 152 acts as a NES that enables the CHIKV CP to be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via CRM1.",

In New World alphavirus infected cells, CP induces apoptosis through transcription inhibition predominantly determined by either the amino-terminal fragment of the protein or by the positively charged RNA-binding domain. In Old World alphaviruses which include CHIKV, CP does not induce transcriptional inhibition or apoptosis [21]. Despite the localization of CHIKV CP in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, the molecular mechanism underlying its intracellular transport as well as the regulation of import and export was unknown. Although alphavirus CP have multiple critical functions attributed to it, some of them remain undefined. Although alphavirus CPs are small enough for karyopherin-independent nuclear transport [7], some were described to harbour an NLS that mediates energy dependent transport [4,15]. A replicon based study on Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) confirms this observation for a New World alphavirus[5]. Even though not on nuclear transport, there are studies showing the presence of CP in the nucleus. A recent piece of work on hnRNP-K and UBQLN4 localization in CHIKV-infected cells [22] also shows CP in the nucleus and another study on the Old World and New World alphaviruses on transcriptional shutoff describes nuclear distribution of CP [21].",

To identify and characterize the NES in CHIKV CP, we tested deletion mutants fused to EGFP. Removal of 46 C-terminal aa had no effect as the protein remained in both cellular compartments. The leucine-rich region between aa 143 and 155 was further examined as a potential NES site. NES occur frequently in protein sequences, but may not be interacting with CRM1, mainly as they can be hidden within the hydrophobic core of the protein rendering them inaccessible for CRM1. Once such sequences are separated and expressed in another context, e.g. as a fusion protein, they may bind to CRM1 and promote nuclear export beyond any relevance for the respective native protein [27-29]. Structural analysis of CHIKV CP as whole protein showed that it forms a protruding ridge kind of structure, thereby making it accessible for the hydrophobic cleft of the CRM1 binding site made as to assume its biological relevance. To look at the possible role of this motif in CHIKV CP nuclear export, deletion of the 118 C-terminal aa rendered the remaining protein exclusively nuclear. Since removal of such a bulk part of the protein can largely affect its structural and functional properties, it was necessary to confirm our results by an additional method. Through site-directed mutagenesis the leucine residues at positions 149 and 152 were substituted for alanine. These alterations rendered the protein fully nuclear and thus, the CHIKV CP NES was mapped between aa 143 and 155.",

The proposed CHIKV CP NES (IDNADLAKLAF) has spacings of hydrophobic positions \u03a61xxxx\u03a62xx\u03a63x\u03a64 (\u03a6=L, I, V, F, or M; x is any amino acid). This is more similar to a non-classical NES (Table 2) than the prototypical classical NES \u03a6-x2-3-\u03a6-x2-3-\u03a6-x-\u03a6. An upstream valine present in the CHIKV CP can also add to the NES (VKGTIDNADLAKLAF) according to new NES consensus in which a \u03a60 is present followed by \u03a61xxxx\u03a62xx\u03a63x\u03a64. In silico docking reveals that the CHIKV CP NES has a mode of binding similar to the snurportin-1 CRM1 complex, as reported in PDB ID 3NBY. The conserved hydrophobic residues of the consensus NES in snurportin-1 and CHIKV CP are protruding on one face of the structure to dock into the CRM1. The hydrophobic side chains of CHIKV CP NES can be superimposed to the respective side chains of snurportin-1. The snurportin-1 and CHIKV CP have differences in the number of spacings between conserved hydrophobic residues, but these are accommodated with minor conformational deviations in the backbone whereas the conserved hydrophobic side chains in two structures occupy equivalent space, respectively. Even though suboptimal spacing can weaken CRM1 binding like that of snurportin-1 [27], the difference in spacing should not affect docking itself, as NES ligands can compensate for different \u03a6 spacings by adapting their conformations to the rigid NES binding site. This variability in \u03a6 spacing can cause greater diversity in functional NES as all hydrophobic positions are not necessarily essential if other \u03a6 positions are strong [27]. Here, hydrophobic NES residues including leucines at 149 and 152 contribute strongly to the NES binding site as seen with their binding energy, or as mutating those to alanine inhibited the nuclear export.",

Alphaviruses have characterized NLS in both NSP2 and CP: In Old World alphaviruses NSP2 but not CP induces apoptosis [21,42-44], while in New World alphavirus apoptosis is induced by CP [45] and not NSP2 [21]. This also means that both, Old and New World alphaviruses have different functions associated with its nuclear transport of proteins. The fact that alphaviruses replicate in enucleated vertebrate [46] but not invertebrate cells [47] points to a different role of nuclear transport in both cell types. It may be possible that nuclear transport of CP is important if not essential in invertebrates like mosquito as the alternate host but not in vertebrates. Comparing the replication of Chikungunya virus in both cell types with and without inhibiting nuclear import and export may help to clarify the differences. At this stage, the exact role associated with CHIKV CP nuclear import and export remains unclear and has to be further investigated in an infectious system.",

To clone pCHIKV-CP-EGFP, full-length CHIKV CP was amplified from our previously described expression plasmid in which the protease cleavage site had been inactivated by exchanging serine 213 to alanine [3]. The amplimer created with the oligonucleotide primers HindIIIChikcap_fwd 5\u2032-aagcttatggagttcatcccaacccaaac-3\u2032 and ChikcapXmaI_rev 5\u2032-atcccgggtccactcttcggctc-3\u2032 was inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) into the restriction sites HindIII and XmaI in frame with EGFP.
