The virus is endemic in Africa, Asia, southeast Europe, and the Middle East. Hyalomma ticks transmit the virus to humans, wildlife, and livestock. Humans may also be infected by contact with infected livestock. Human-to-human transmission occurs mainly in the hospital setting. In humans, the virus causes a febrile illness that may be associated with hemorrhage, liver necrosis, shock, and multiorgan failure. Further hallmarks of the disease are increased levels of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT, respectively), thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The average case fatality rate is 30\u201350%, but may be higher in nosocomial outbreaks [1]\u2013[5].",

Endothelial and liver cell damage, induction of proinflammatory cytokines, and dysregulation of the coagulation cascade are thought to play a role [3]\u2013[8]. Studies on the pathophysiology of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been hampered by the lack of an appropriate animal model, as no mammal with fully functional immune system has been described so far \u2014 except humans \u2014 that develops disease upon infection. The first animal model was neonatal mouse [9]. Recently, two transgenic mouse models for CCHF have been described, first, mice lacking the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice) and second, mice lacking the type I (alpha/beta) interferon receptor (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice) [10]\u2013[12]. Both knockout mice are defective in the innate immune response, die rapidly from CCHFV infection, and reproduce relevant aspects of human CCHF. Surrogate models for CCHF employ IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with Dugbe or Hazara virus [13], [14], two CCHFV-related nairoviruses that are not known to cause disease in human. Work with these models can be carried out at biosafety level (BSL)-2, while work with infectious CCHFV requires BSL-4 facilities.",

            "text": "In the present study, we aimed at characterizing the pathological changes in the liver of CCHFV-infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice in more detail. Furthermore, we employed this model to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 (favipiravir) against CCHFV in vivo. These drugs are either in clinical use or in an advanced stage of clinical testing. Ribavirin inhibits CCHFV replication in cell culture [15] and is administered to CCHF patients, though its clinical benefit is not proven and discussed controversially [16]\u2013[19]. It shows beneficial effects in the neonatal and STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mouse models [9], [10]. Ribavirin currently is the only drug available for treatment of CCHF. Arbidol is a broad-spectrum antiviral showing activity against a range of RNA viruses in vitro and in vivo, most notably influenza A virus [20]\u2013[24]. In Russia and China, the drug is in clinical use primarily for prophylaxis and treatment of acute respiratory infections including influenza. Arbidol is assumed to act via hydrophobic interactions with membranes and virus proteins, thus inhibiting viral fusion and entry [25]\u2013[27]. T-705 is a potent inhibitor in vitro and in animal models of influenza virus, phleboviruses, hantaviruses, arenaviruses, alphaviruses, picornaviruses, and norovirus [28]\u2013[35]. Following conversion to T-705-ribofuranosyl-5\u2032-triphosphate, it presumably acts as a nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or causes lethal mutagenesis upon incorporation into the virus RNA [36]\u2013[40]. T-705 (favipiravir) is currently in late stage clinical development for the treatment of influenza virus infection.",

Cell growth and viability under compound treatment was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) method as described [43]. A sigmoidal dose\u2013response curve was fitted to the data using Prism GraphPad 6.0 (GraphPad Software). The inhibitory concentrations that reduced the virus titer by 50%, 90%, and 99% (IC50, IC90, and IC99, respectively) and the cytotoxic concentrations that reduced cell growth by 50% and 90% (CC50 and CC90, respectively) were calculated from the sigmoidal functions.",

The IC90 values were derived from the prior single-drug experiments. The drug combination data were analyzed using the Bliss independence drug interaction model [44]. This model is defined by the equation Exy = Ex+Ey\u2212(Ex\u2022Ey), where Exy is the additive effect of drugs x and y as predicted by their individual effects Ex and Ey. Ex = (Vobs(0,0)\u2212Vobs(cx,0))/Vobs(0,0) and Ey = (Vobs(0,0)\u2212Vobs(0,cy))/Vobs(0,0), where Vobs(cx,cy) is the observed, i.e. experimentally determined virus titer for (cx,cy). In analogy to the MacSynergy II program [44], [45], which evaluates antivirus data according to the Bliss independence model, a three-dimensional approach was used to identify areas where observed effects are greater (synergy) or less (antagonism) than those predicted by Exy. To this end, the ratio between predicted virus titer Vpred(cx,cy) = Vobs(0,0)\u2022(1\u2212Exy) and observed virus titer Vobs(cx,cy) was calculated for each drug combination (cx,cy). A ratio >1 indicates synergy (i.e. for (cx,cy) the virus titer predicted for additive effect is higher than the experimentally determined virus titer), a ratio <1 indicates antagonism (i.e. for (cx,cy) the virus titer for predicted additive effect is lower than the experimentally determined virus titer).",

Animals died from the infection even after inoculation with 0.3 FFU (inoculum, died/infected: 0.3 FFU, 4/5; 1 FFU, 5/5; 3 FFU, 4/5; 10 FFU, 6/8; 100 FFU 13/13; 1,000 FFU, 8/8; 10,000 FFU, 3/3). This indicates that only a few infectious virus particles of CCHFV strain Afg09-2990 are sufficient to initiate a productive infection. A lethal outcome was consistently observed with \u2265100 FFU. Therefore, the model was further characterized for the inoculation doses 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 FFU (Fig. 1). Animals infected with 100 or 1,000 FFU died between days 3 and 6, while animals infected with 10,000 FFU uniformly died at day 2. Before death, animals lost about 15% of body weight (Fig. 1). At day 2, the mean AST and ALT values were around 300 U/l and 100 U/l, respectively, in animals inoculated with 100\u20131,000 FFU. Both values were higher in the 10,000 FFU group (AST 1,600 U/l and ALT 500 U/l) (Fig. 1). AST and ALT elevations indicated cell damage, in particular of liver cells. At day 2, virus titer in blood ranged from below detection lime in the 10 FFU group, via 3 log10 FFU/ml in the 100 and 1,000 FFU groups, up to 5 log10 FFU/ml in the 10,000 FFU group (Fig. 1). At day 3, virus was found in all organs analyzed (spleen, kidney, liver, heart, lung, and brain) at titers ranging from 4\u20137 log10 FFU/g irrespective of the inoculation dose (Fig. 1). The maximum virus concentration was found in liver. As the inoculation with \u226410 FFU was not uniformly lethal and the inoculation with 10,000 FFU leaves only 2 days between infection and lethal outcome for therapeutic intervention, further experiments were conducted with a dose of 100 or 1,000 FFU.",

Both groups of IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with 100 FFU CCHFV. Although one animal survived after treatment, ribavirin did not significantly increase the survival rate (p = 0.4). However, the drug prolonged the time to death (median 3 vs. 6 days for placebo vs. ribavirin, p = 0.0007), reduced the levels of AST (p = 0.001) and ALT (p = 0.006) at day 2, reduced the virus titer in blood at day 2 (p = 0.0007), increased the weight at day 2 and 3 (p = 0.03 and p = 0.002, respectively), and reduced the terminal virus concentration in all organs when compared to placebo at day 3 (p<0.001 separately for each organ). Histopathological analysis of organs collected at day 3 from ribavirin-treated mice revealed only small disseminated foci of necrosis; most of the liver parenchyma resembled na\u00efve mice. Markedly reduced hepatocellular necrosis correlated with low numbers of apoptotic hepatocytes (cleaved caspase-3), T-cells (CD3), B-cells (B220), and activated monocyte-derived cells (iNOS). Virus antigen-positive cells (NP) were significantly reduced in liver and spleen compared to untreated or placebo-treated mice (data not shown). However, ribavirin-treated mice that succumbed to infection on days 4\u20139 showed extensive bridging hepatocellular necrosis at the time of death (Fig. 2). Like in untreated mice, the necrosis was accompanied by presence of numerous Iba-1-positive macrophages (Kupffer cells), showing enlarged cell bodies and focal clustering, and iNOS-expressing activated monocyte-derived cells (Fig. 3). Both alterations are suggestive for strong monocyte/macrophage activation. However, in contrast to untreated mice, virus antigen was hardly detectable in liver tissue of the treated mice (Fig. 2), consistent with the low virus titer in all organs (Fig. 5, bottom). Thus, ribavirin reduces CCHFV load and delays disease progression, but it does not prevent terminal liver necrosis, monocyte/macrophage activation, and lethal outcome in the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mouse model.",

The 8\u00d78 concentration matrix was designed around the IC90 values of both drugs as determined above. Infectious virus particles were measured 3 days p.i. by immunofocus assay and cell viability was determined by the MTT method. The dose\u2013response surface demonstrates that combinations of ribavirin and T-705 exhibit strong antiviral effects with suppression of virus replication by >5 log units (Fig. 8A). Possible antagonistic or synergistic effects were evaluated using the Bliss independence model in analogy to the algorithms of the MacSynergy II program [44], [45]. This analysis revealed clear synergistic effects when the drugs were combined in concentrations around their IC90. In this area of the matrix, the experimental virus titer was up to 2 log units lower than the titer predicted according to the Bliss independence model for additive effect (Fig. 8B). The MTT test did not reveal drug toxicity over the whole matrix (Fig. 8B).",

The 30 mg/(kg\u00d7d) T-705 dose, which is protective upon single-drug administration, was chosen to test if addition of ribavirin interferes with T-705 efficacy. To explore if combination of two sub-effective doses may result in an effective treatment, 7.5 mg/(kg\u00d7d) T-705 and 100 mg/(kg\u00d7d) ribavirin were co-administered. None of the parameters in the 30 mg/(kg\u00d7d) T-705 plus 100 mg/(kg\u00d7d) ribavirin group (Fig. 9, left) was statistically significantly different from the parameters of the 30 mg/(kg\u00d7d) T-705 single-drug group (Fig. 7).

In conclusion, T-705 and ribavirin exert synergistic effects according to the Bliss independence model when combined in concentrations around their IC90\nin vitro. Co-administration of both drugs in the animal model suggests that a combined treatment yields beneficial rather than adverse effects.",

CCHFV-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes were found in the necrotic areas. Ribavirin, arbidol hydrochloride, and T-705 were active against CCHFV Afg09-2990 in cell culture.

The latter models take advantage of the defect in the innate immune response, which apparently is essential to protect mice from productive CCHFV infection. In all three models, mice are dying from the infection within a few days. We prefer to work with IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice, as the genetic defect concerns only the interferon type I signaling, while STAT1 deficiency prevents the upregulation of genes due to a signal by either type I or type II interferons and neonatal mice are immunologically tolerant (neonatal tolerance). IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to CCHFV infection. The inoculum sufficient to initiate a productive infection is very low \u2014 0.3 FFU \u2014 which presumably corresponds to just a few infectious virus particles. This is consistent with experiments in AG129 mice lacking interferon type I and type II receptors, in which an inoculum of 0.1 FFU of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was sufficient to infect the animals [49].",

            "text": "It has been shown very recently that the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 model mimics hallmarks of human CCHF disease [12]. These findings are extended here by a more detailed immunhistopathological analysis of the liver. Histopathology, virus load measurement, antigen staining in various organs, and the measurement of AST and ALT demonstrate that the liver is the major target organ of CCHFV. Although virus was found in all organs, the titer in liver is the highest and exceeds 7 log10 FFU/g in some experiments. The higher virus titer in liver compared to other organs may explain why the IHC analysis for virus antigen revealed clearly positive cells only in the liver, while the signals in other organs were weak or absent. In exceptional cases, AST and ALT values reached 10,000 U/l and 1,000 U/l, respectively, demonstrating massive liver cell damage. However, while ALT is specific for this organ, AST is also present at high level in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells [50]. Therefore, the high AST/ALT ratio may also indicate extrahepatic cell damage. Overall, the histological and biochemical findings are compatible with the diagnosis of a fulminant liver damage. Our findings are also in agreement with the pathological observations in human CCHF; hepatocellular necrosis with hyperplastic and hypertrophic Kupffer cells and mild or absent inflammatory cell infiltrates is the prominent histopathological finding in humans [3]. Two new aspects, which may provide some clues as to the pathophysiology of CCHF, are noteworthy. First, in the necrotic lesions of the liver, both CCHFV-infected hepatocytes and apoptotic hepatocytes clustered. This may suggest that CCHFV-infected cells undergo apoptosis and necrosis. As the inflammatory response was only mild to moderate, a direct cytopathic effect of the virus on hepatocytes may be involved in the induction of apoptosis and necrosis. Importantly, this hypothesis has been raised in early IHC studies on humans with CCHF as well [3]. Secondly, activated Iba-1-positive macrophages and activated monocyte-derived cells expressing iNOS were found in the liver. These cells may play a crucial role in the strong proinflammatory immune responses following CCHFV infection, as demonstrated by significant increases of serum proinflammatory cytokines and chemoattractant molecules in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 and STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice, as well as in humans [6]\u2013[8], [10], [12].",

Importantly, the development of terminal liver necrosis with marked monocyte/macrophage activation in the virtual absence of virus in the organ demonstrates that host pathways, once they are triggered by the virus, mediate pathology and death irrespective of the presence of the trigger.",

The drug was administered via the same route but at higher dose than in previous studies that showed beneficial effects against influenza A, coxsackie B, and hantaan virus in mice [20], [22]. The compound had significant toxicity at higher concentrations in cell culture. It is conceivable that its antiviral effect in vitro is at least partially attributable to general cell toxic effects that are not detected in the MTT assay used to assess cell viability. Therefore, it might be that the in vitro data overestimate the true antiviral effect of the drug against CCHFV. In addition, arbidol is extremely hydrophobic, which may reduce its oral bioavailability in mice.

Therefore, its activity against CCHFV, a bunyavirus of the genus nairovirus, is not unexpected. However, in view of the low or lacking potency of ribavirin and arbidol in vivo \u2014 both of which have almost the same IC50 and IC90 values than T-705 \u2014 the high in vivo potency of T-705 is surprising. The IC50 for CCHFV is 5\u201330 times lower than the IC50 values for other bunyaviruses [35], which may indicate that this virus is particularly sensitive to T-705. Even if it was given 2 days before the expected time of death, the animals survived and hardly showed signs of disease. If given immediately post-exposure, the drug suppresses virus replication below the level required to elicit antibodies. We could reduce the dose by a factor of 20 [from 300 to 15 mg/(kg\u00d7d)] with the drug still showing post-exposure efficacy.",

In analogy to other segmented negative strand viruses, T-705-ribofuranosyl-5\u2032-triphosphate may be incorporated into the nascent RNA strand and inhibit further strand extension or induce lethal mutagenesis [36]\u2013[40]. How ribavirin acts against CCHFV is still not known, although the drug is in clinical use since decades. Several mechanisms have been proposed for other viruses: it may be incorporated into the virus RNA causing lethal mutagenesis [52], interfere with capping [53], inhibit the viral RNA polymerase [54], [55] or inhibit the host cell enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) resulting in reduced GTP levels [56]\u2013[58]. T-705-ribofuranosyl-5\u2032-monophosphate was 150 times weaker than ribavirin-5\u2032-monophosphate in its IMPDH inhibitory effect, suggesting that IMPDH is not a major target enzyme for T-705 [39], [40]. Given that the mode of action of both drugs is poorly understood, it is difficult to predict how they interact. However, as ribavirin is the standard drug for treatment of CCHF [16]\u2013[19], a ribavirin/T-705 combination treatment would be an obvious option in clinical practice. Our experiments suggest that both drugs do not act in an antagonistic manner in vitro and in vivo. According to the Bliss independence model there is even evidence for synergistic interaction in vitro and the experiments in the animal model point to a beneficial rather than adverse interaction in vivo.

(B) In analogy to the MacSynergy II program [44], [45], a three-dimensional approach was used to identify areas where observed effects are greater (synergy) or less (antagonism) than predicted by the Bliss independence model. To this end, the ratio between predicted virus titer and observed virus titer was calculated for each drug combination. A ratio >1 indicates synergy (i.e. the virus titer predicted for additive effect is higher than the experimentally determined virus titer), a ratio <1 indicates antagonism (i.e. for the virus titer for predicted additive effect is lower than the experimentally determined virus titer).
