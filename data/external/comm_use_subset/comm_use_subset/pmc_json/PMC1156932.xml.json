These infections may predispose certain patients to develop chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [1]. Clinical symptoms include mucus secretion and altered airway reactivity and are hallmarked by the recruitment of inflammatory cells with resultant changes to the airway epithelial cell lining. Inflammation can also extend further into the lung to cause parenchymal disease that is characteristic of viral pneumonia as has been observed recently in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2]. Inflammatory cell recruitment in large part is elicited by the generation of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) that are also important in establishing a pro-inflammatory environment underlying chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and BPD [1,3-10].",

Viral infections of epithelial cells are characterized by the generation of the pro-inflammatory molecule double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during intracellular replication of viruses. When studied in human epithelial cell lines in vitro, dsRNA triggers an innate immune response in host cells via generation of cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammatory cell recruitment. Specifically, dsRNA has been shown to induce activation of the neutrophil chemoattractant, interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8), and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) [16]. In human subjects in vivo, elevated tracheal IL-8/CXCL8 levels and neutrophil accumulation are found in airways of patients with asthma, COPD, and viral infection. While animal models in vivo have largely studied the systemic effects of intraperitoneal dsRNA treatment [17], there is a paucity of information on characterization and role of chemokines in lung inflammation and injury following intratracheal dsRNA instillation.",

To test this hypothesis, we injected dsRNA intratracheally into 6\u20138 week old female BALB/c mice to measure neutrophil and chemokine responses and resultant injury in the airway and lung tissue compartments. We then blocked this response by pretreating animals with antibodies to specifically neutralize neutrophil recruitment in a chemokine-dependent manner and thereby decreased lung inflammation and injury. Our animal model demonstrates the critical role of CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 in acute lung inflammation and injury due to intratracheal dsRNA.",

Polyclonal goat anti-murine CXCR2 was produced by the immunization of a goat with a peptide containing the ligand-binding sequence Met-Gly-Glu-Phe-Lys-Val-Asp-Lys-Phe-Asn-Ile-Glu-Asp-Phe-Phe-Ser-Gly of CXCR2 [24-31]. The goat was immunized with CXCR2 in multiple intradermal sites with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) followed by at least 3 boosts of CXCR2 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) as previously described. [24-31]. Direct ELISA was used to evaluate antisera titers, and sera was used for Western blot, ELISA and neutralization assays when titers had reached greater than 1/1,000,000. The CXCR2 protein sequence has been shown to contain the ligand-binding portion of the CXCR2 receptor [24-26,32]. The anti-CXCR2 antibodies have been used previously to block mouse CXCR2 in vivo, and has been shown to detect CXCR2 by Western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of neutrophils in vivo [24-26,32]. The anti-CXCR2 antibody has been shown to be neutralizing using both in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis assay and in vivo by abrogating the influx of neutrophils into the peritoneum of normal mice in response to exogenous ELR-positive murine CXC chemokines [24-26,32]. In vivo administration of anti-CXCR2 antibodies inhibited pulmonary neutrophil sequestration in murine models of Aspergillosis, Nocardia, and Pseudomonas pneumonia and prevented the influx of neutrophils in urine and the kidney in a murine model of Escherichia coli urinary tract infection [24-26,32]. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of this antibody did not alter peripheral blood neutrophil counts [24-26,32]. 1 ml of antiserum against mCXCR2 and control antibody is approximately 10 mg of IgG.",

The primers used were 5'-TGA-GCT-GCG-CTG-TCA-GTG-CCT-3' (sense) and 5'-AGA-AGC-CAG-CGT-TCA-CCA-GA-3' (antisense) for CXCL1 (259 bp) and 5'-GCT-GGC-CAC-CAA-CCA-CCA-GG-3' (sense) and 5'-AGC-GAG-GCA-CAT-CAG-GTA-CG-3' (antisense) for murine CXCL2/3 (359 bp). Predeveloped assay reagents (Applied Biosystems Kit 4304134) were used for murine CXCR2 and the housekeeping gene, 18S. Quantitative analysis of gene expression was done using the comparative CT (\u0394CT) methods, in which CT is the threshold cycle number (the minimum number of cycles needed before the product can be detected)[40,41]. The arithmetic formula for the \u0394CT method is the difference in threshold cycles for a target, (i.e., CXCR2) and an endogenous reference (i.e., housekeeping gene 18S). The amount of target normalized to an endogenous reference (i.e., CXCR2 in dsRNA-treated animals) and relative to a calibration normalized to an endogenous reference (i.e., CXCR2 in ssRNA-treated controls) is given by 2-\u0394\u0394CT [40,41]. The following is an example for comparing CXCR2 expression from dsRNA-treated animals and ssRNA-treated controls. Both CXCR2 from dsRNA-treated and ssRNA-treated controls are normalized to 18S: \u0394\u0394CT = \u0394CT (CXCR2 expression from dsRNA-treated animals normalized to endogenous 18S)-\u0394CT (CXCR2 expression from ssRNA-treated controls normalized to endogenous 18S). The calculation of 2-\u0394\u0394CT then gives a relative value when comparing the target with the calibrator, which we designate in this context as fold increase of dsRNA-treated animals to ssRNA-treated controls of the target mRNA relative quantification.",

Extravasation of Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich) into the extravascular compartment was used as a quantitative measure of lung injury and changes in microvasculature permeability. Briefly, each animal received 20 mg/kg Evans blue (pH 7.34) by tail vein injection 3 h before sacrifice. At the time of sacrifice, a heparinized sample of blood was harvested, and plasma was removed by centrifugation. Six lungs from each group were perfused free of blood with 1 ml 0.9% normal saline via the spontaneously beating right ventricle and removed from the thoracic cavity. The trachea, mainstem bronchi, and surrounding mediastinal structures were removed. Evans blue was extracted from pulmonary tissues after homogenization in 1 ml of 0.9% normal saline. This volume was added to 2 vol of deionized formamide and incubated at 60C for 12 h. The supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7 G for 30 min. Evans blue in the plasma and lung tissue was quantitated by dual-wavelength spectrophotometric analysis at 620 and 740 nm [43]. This method corrects the specimen's absorbance at 620 nm for the absorbance of contaminating heme pigments, using the following formula: corrected absorbance at 620 nm = actual absorbance at 620 nm \u2013 (1.426(absorbance at 740) + 0.03). We calculated a permeability index by dividing the correct pulmonary plasma Evans blue absorbance at 620 nm; this index reflects the degree of extravasation of Evans blue into the extravascular pulmonary tissue compartment.",

The putative receptor for dsRNA has been identified as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), thus we first determined whether dsRNA treatment was associated with expression of TLR3. Immunolocalization using goat anti-murine TLR3 Ab showed markedly increased expression of TLR3 localized to the surface airway epithelium of dsRNA-treated lungs as compared to ssRNA-treated controls at 72 h. Specificity to TLR3 was demonstrated by lack of staining on control goat IgG-stained sections from both dsRNA and ssRNA-treated groups (Fig. 1).",

The innate or acute inflammatory component is associated with a predominance of infiltrating neutrophils. While many viral infections of the lung are self-limiting, the associated lung injury due to this initial event may be critical in establishing a pro-inflammatory environment underlying certain chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, viral pneumonia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [1,3-10]. The host's inflammatory response to viral replication leads to pulmonary pathology hallmarked by leukocyte infiltrate and resultant microvascular leak that progresses to lung edema and the clinical signs of pneumonia. As the lung injury persists or recurs with multiple subsequent viral infections, pulmonary vascular and airway remodeling may occur and eventually lead to development of airway hyper-reactivity and/or interstitial fibrosis [44]. Viral infections are mediated by dsRNA, a proinflammatory molecule generated during viral replication. DsRNA binds to its cell surface receptor, TLR3, and activates the production of downstream gene products, such as CXC chemokines. In this study, we hypothesized that the interaction between CXCR2 and ELR-positive CXC chemokines expressed during dsRNA-induced lung inflammation is critical in mediating neutrophil recruitment, a pivotal process required for dsRNA induced lung injury in viral infections.",

A similar study using intratracheal delivery of live virus also demonstrated marked pulmonary pathology including mucous cell metaplasia and airway epithelial remodeling [47]. Another study focusing specifically on the effects of intratracheal dsRNA at a low dose found similar systemic inflammatory effects but specific pulmonary effects only when dsRNA was delivered in conjunction with IFN\u03b3 [48]. Finally, a recent study examined the effects of inhibiting the CC chemokine receptor, CCR1, during live-virus exposure in mice and showed that mortality during pneumovirus infection was decreased [49]. The present study extends these findings by first determining the effects of high-dose intratracheal dsRNA alone on neutrophil recruitment and lung injury in BALB/c mice and then subsequently blocking these effects via inhibition of the CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR2.",

We used a maximal dose of dsRNA at 40 \u03bcg/g mouse wt after initial studies at lower doses (4 \u03bcg/g and 20 \u03bcg/g) showed minimal leukocytic infiltrate. Furthermore, we are aware of only one other publication that describes intratracheal dsRNA delivery that showed no effects when used alone at low concentration (10 ug/g) [48]. Histopathological analysis demonstrated a significantly increased leukocytic infiltrate at 72 h following intratracheal dsRNA as compared to earlier time points. We thus chose this observation as the basis to focus upon the 72 h timepoint. Other studies using administration of dsRNA in BALB/c mice in vivo have also shown a maximal innate immune response starting at 72 h following dsRNA exposure [50] Further characterization at 72 h following intratracheal dsRNA showed that neutrophils were a predominant cell type and that there was an associated injury to alveolar-capillary membrane integrity as shown by increased lung edema and microvascular leak.",

Our findings of a significant increase in neutrophil infiltration following dsRNA treatment are consistent with findings from previous studies using a live virus that also resulted in early neutrophil infiltration [47]. In order to determine whether neutrophil influx was causally linked to the lung injury observed in our system, we performed studies using a monoclonal antibody to the Ly6G antigen on the surface of mouse granulocytes to specifically deplete neutrophils. These results showed decreased numbers of lung neutrophils by FACS analysis and BAL as expected with no reduction in monocyte number, and also showed a decrease in lung microvascular leak and therefore decreased lung injury associated with decreased neutrophil recruitment. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in recruiting these neutrophils remained to be fully elucidated.",

Furthermore, in vivo studies using live virus have also demonstrated that CXC chemokines are generated during lung inflammation [45-47]. Having demonstrated that lung injury due to intratracheal dsRNA is dependent on neutrophil infiltration, we determined that CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 expression was significantly greater in the lungs of dsRNA-treated mice than in lungs of ssRNA-treated controls. Furthermore, expression of CXCR2 mRNA was similarly increased in parallel to the production of both CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 ligands and neutrophil sequestration during dsRNA-induced lung inflammation. Other studies of inflammatory diseases, such as ventilator-induced lung injury, pneumonia, and hyperoxia-induced lung injury have demonstrated the importance of CXCR2 expression and its role in neutrophil recruitment during the pathogenesis of these diseases [24,40,41,51]. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that augmented levels of CXCR2 ligands are important in the recruitment of neutrophils during the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and suggest that the interaction between CXCR2 ligands and CXCR2 may be pivotal in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung during dsRNA-induced lung injury.",

This suggests that if other leukocytes are recruited there are redundant pathways involved in their recruitment that are CXCR2-independent.

            "text": "TLR3 is a pattern-recognition cell surface receptor that is responsible for specifically recognizing extracellular dsRNA [52]. It is a member of a family of toll-like receptors (TLRs) that aid the host in combating infections when microbial pathogens bind to their specific toll-like receptor to trigger NF\u03baB and downstream generation of cytokines and costimulatory molecules during the innate immune attack. TLR3 thus plays an important role in host defense against viral infections. Our study showed that dsRNA treatment induced the expression of TLR3 on the cell surface of airways as compared to ssRNA-treated controls animals. The upregulation of TLR3 in dsRNA-exposed mouse airways suggests a positive feedback system in which epithelial cells exposed to dsRNA increase TLR3 expression on their cell surface. A similar upregulation of TLR3 has previously been described in epithelial cells in vitro treated with Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)[53]. These findings are also consistent with in vivo studies using monoclonal antibody to TLR3 and genetic knockout mice of TLR3 [52,54] that establish the role of TLR3 in dsRNA recognition and raise the interesting possibility that TLR3 may be involved in the signaling pathway mediating dsRNA induction of CXC chemokines.",
