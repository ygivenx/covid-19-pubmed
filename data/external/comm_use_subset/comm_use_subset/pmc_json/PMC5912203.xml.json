The detection of airborne pathogen inoculum has been improved through the development of quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays that allow for near real-time monitoring of inoculum concentration (Carisse et al., 2009b; Rogers, Atkins & West, 2009; Temple & Johnson, 2011; Thiessen et al., 2016). Despite the utility of qPCR to monitor pathogens, it is often impractical due to requirements for experienced laboratory staff and expensive equipment to accurately assess pathogen concentration (Notomi et al., 2000; West et al., 2008).",

LAMP can use relatively inexpensive and mobile equipment and utilizes the Bst polymerase that has a high tolerance to reaction inhibitors (Kubota et al., 2011), which allows for quick, minimal DNA extraction protocols. These traits make LAMP useful in field detection assays (Harper, Ward & Clover, 2010; Kubota et al., 2008; Temple & Johnson, 2011; Tomlinson, Barker & Boonham, 2007; Tomlinson, Dickinson & Boonham, 2010).",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification has been developed for monitoring inoculum in numerous plant pathosystems, including grape powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator), fire blight of pear (Erwinia amylovora), and gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) (Temple & Johnson, 2011; Thiessen et al., 2016; Tomlinson, Dickinson & Boonham, 2010). Traditional LAMP assays produce a magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate when DNA is amplified that can be detected with the human eye; however, in low concentrations of target DNA, precipitate may be difficult to observe (Jenkins et al., 2011; Kubota et al., 2011; Thiessen et al., 2016) or require expensive equipment (Temple & Johnson, 2011). Several dyes have been explored to improve detection including SYBR green (Notomi et al., 2000), hydroxynaphthol blue (Cardoso et al., 2010), and other synthetic dyes (Fischbach et al., 2015), but the dyes have the potential to inhibit LAMP reactions or require the use of spectrophotometers, which increase labor and equipment costs. The use of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based probe, allows for specific detection of LAMP products and target quantification from field samples without inhibiting amplification (Kubota et al., 2011), and several portable fluorescence-reading LAMP devices have been made commercially available, such as the Genie (Optigene Ltd., West Sussex, UK) and Bioranger (Diagenetix, Inc., Honolulu, HI, USA). Using a fluorescent probe also reduces potential classification error from visual detection of LAMP products, which may improve the accuracy of pathogen detection and allow for quantification.",

More recently, fungicide applications have been reduced using inoculum detection systems (Thiessen, Neill & Mahaffee, 2017; Thiessen et al., 2016); however, these systems do not provide in-field inoculum concentration for producers. Additionally, the LAMP assay that was successfully designed for field use in the grape powdery mildew pathosystem had numerous false negatives or false positives, which may have been caused by difficulty in perceiving the magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate, reducing the predictive values of the LAMP assay (Thiessen et al., 2016). A timely and cost-effective system that improves detection of E. necator inoculum throughout the growing season is needed to allow growers to accurately time fungicide applications early in the growing season and adjust application intervals based on inoculum concentration.",

Rods with one or 10 spores were created by transferring individual spores with eyelash brush. A total of six independent spore dilution series were used to generate the standard curve for the quantitative assay. Additionally, a set of sample rods containing 500 conidia was also generated using the conidial suspension to act as a positive control for all DNA extractions and molecular reactions. The rods were air dried prior to processing.",

            "text": "A highly sensitive qLAMP assay was successfully developed using a simple DNA extraction method for use by growers or crop consultants to use as a decision aid for timing fungicide applications similar to Thiessen et al. (2016) and Thiessen, Neill & Mahaffee (2017). The qLAMP assay developed was sensitive to E. necator DNA with one spore amplifying 80% (n = 10) using the simplified DNA extraction. This sensitivity indicated that the assay should be suitable to detect inoculum (i.e., ascospores) at low concentrations (<10 spores) and aid management decisions. However, the qLAMP assay consistently underrepresented spore quantities later in the growing season compared to the qPCR assay, which may be due to an increase in the presence of PCR inhibitors (such as pollen, humic acids from soil, spider webs, etc.) found in air samples (Wilson, 1997) that may not have been removed by the rapid Chelex DNA extraction. In early DNA extraction testing prior to qLAMP sensitivity loss, the PowerSoil\u00ae extracted DNA showed more consistent amplification of field samples than the other extraction methods (Thiessen et al., 2016); however, the PowerSoil\u00ae DNA extraction kit requires a larger time commitment and several steps that may not be feasible for in-field DNA extractions. The LAMP assay has been widely described as more tolerant to inhibitors than qPCR (Francois et al., 2011; Kaneko et al., 2007), but it appears that the LAMP assay tolerates different inhibitors than the qPCR assay (Nixon et al., 2014). Additionally, the qLAMP RT variance from one to 10 spore samples (Fig. 2) was so great that they cannot be distinguished. This variance is likely due to using DNA extractions of each spore concentration as opposed a dilution from higher spore concentration as is typically done (Mahaffee & Stoll, 2016). Because the LAMP assay is not limited by temperature cycles, annealing is reliant on proximity of DNA to the polymerase and primer set (Notomi et al., 2000), and the improved sensitivity with lower annealing temperatures is likely the result of lower specificity of primers rather than optimal reaction temperature. In reactions with lower quantities of DNA (e.g., one and 10 spores), more time may be required for the polymerase, primers, and target DNA to meet, which may explain the variability of RT values of low spore quantities (Fig. 2). The inhibition of the field qLAMP assay and the difficulty of differentiating low spore quantities indicates that the assay currently has more utility as a qualitative inoculum detection tool as opposed to quantitative assessment of inoculum availability.",

This may be due to difficulty in assessing positive detections from the output of the mobile device. The curve smoothing algorithm used by the device application (G-qLAMP) often produced curves that drifted linearly with RT values reported even though there was no detectable amplification using gel electrophoresis. Growers conducting the q-LAMP assay were directed to ignore curves that ascended linearly due to curve smoothing; however, this may have caused growers to be overly-conservative in determining positive detections. Additionally, the grower-conducted q-LAMP occurred in 2014 when the loss of q-LAMP sensitivity was observed and there was very low disease.",

This variability may be due to the presence of inhibitors. In 2013, the source of stainless-steel rod material was changed from previous testing, and significant inhibition of DNA amplification was observed. After troubleshooting various rod cleaning processes and DNA extraction techniques, a hexane soak was added to the steel rod cleaning protocol to remove oils prior to sterilization and 5% Chelex 100 was used as the extraction buffer. After the hexane wash step addition, the accuracy of samples was improved to 85%, and the misclassification rate was reduced from 17% to 14%. In addition to inhibitors from the rods, the variability of inhibitors from field collections may have caused inconsistencies in qLAMP assay detection results compared to the qPCR assay detection results. Early in the growing season, the weather in the region is characterized by frequent precipitation events that limit pollen and insect flight. Later in the growing season, pollen, insects, birds, and soil particulates are abundant in the air, and subsequently on the sampling rods. RNAses, DNAses, humic acids, and other heavy metals may not be removed when using the chelex DNA extraction (qLAMP template), but are removed during the Powersoil DNA extraction (qPCR template). The results from the qLAMP had lower true positive proportions and true negative proportions than that of turbidimetric LAMP previously developed (Thiessen et al., 2016). These reductions may be due to other factors besides amplification inhibitors, such as manufacturer differences, degradation of polymerase, inclusion of probes, or buffering of the qLAMP reaction (Corless et al., 2000; Roux, 2009).",

Redesigning primers was another potential approach to examining the cause of the reduced sensitivity; however, the primer set used here was the result of two previous redesigns during development and testing and there was not sufficient heterogeneity in other regions of the ITS. Additionally, the LAMP assay quantification was also affected by numerous inhibitors, such as soil, pollen, or insect debris, found in field collected samples. LAMP is capable of tolerating some inhibitors that affect PCR assays (Francois et al., 2011); however, to determine the extent that LAMP assays are capable of tolerating inhibitors, each potential inhibitor should be tested (Nixon et al., 2014). Other LAMP assays developed have utilized more complex DNA extractions to reduce the effect of inhibitors on amplification for quantitation of DNA (Harper, Ward & Clover, 2010; Kubota et al., 2011; Mori et al., 2004); however, complex DNA extraction techniques are likely to preclude field implementation of LAMP assays and increase assay costs.

Additionally, the qLAMP assay lost sensitivity to low spore quantities (<10 spores) in the 2014 sampling period, and the cause was not determined during the course of this study. Grower-conducted inoculum monitoring technologies, like the qLAMP assay developed in this study, may provide an inexpensive tool for producers to apply targeted fungicide applications based on inoculum presence and concentration. Given the limitations described herein, more assessment of the qLAMP assay degradation is necessary before utilizing it as a monitoring tool for E. necator inoculum concentrations.",
