The main bacterial agents are Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni (Panciera and Confer 2010, Gershwin et al. 2015, Baptista et al. 2017). Bovine respiratory disease virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are the possible viral causes of BRD (Beuttemmuller et al. 2017, Headley et al. 2018). Among these microorganisms, BRSV is frequently associated with BRD (Apley 2006, Grissett et al. 2015).",

However, this classification was revised, and BRSV was renamed bovine orthopneumovirus species and is currently classified into the Orthopneumovirus genus within the newly created Pneumoviridae family (ICTV 2018). BRSV is an enveloped and pleomorphic virus with a negative-sense RNA genome approximately 15,000 nucleotides in length that encodes 10 proteins. The lipid envelope of BRSV consists of three surface glycoproteins, defined as the attachment glycoprotein (G), fusion (F) protein, and the small hydrophobic (SH) protein (Sarmiento-Silva et al. 2012). The F and G genes play important roles in viral infectivity and are the major targets of the immune system (Larsen et al. 2000, Valarcher and Taylor 2007).",

This last domain consists of a highly conserved hydrophobic central region composed of 32 aas and four cysteines that form two disulfide bridges (Doreleijers et al. 1996). Due to its high genetic variation, the G protein may be used for evolutionary analyses of BRSV strains (Valarcher et al. 2000). Based on G gene analysis, BRSV strains were divided into four subgroups designated as A, B, intermediate or AB, and nontyped (Furze et al. 1994, Schrijver et al. 1996, Furze et al. 1997). Following, several studies have focused on the genetic evolution of BRSV on the basis of both G and F sequences and currently the BRSV strains are classified into subgroups I to VIII (Valarcher et al. 2000, Klem et al. 2014, Bertolotti et al. 2018, Kre\u0161i\u0107 et al. 2018).",

Although cut-off values at both the nt and aa levels are not currently established and considering that the nt differences observed in the BRSV prototype strains among each other vary from 5% to 16% (Sarmiento-Silva et al. 2012), it is highly likely that the Brazilian strains in this study represent a putative new subgroup of BRSV.

Usually, it is possible to observe a very limited difference (Valarcher et al. 2000) or complete similarity between the BRSV strains found in animals of the same herd (Larsen 2000; Larsen et al. 2000), revealing that a single virus or group of closely related viruses predominantly infect a given herd at a given time (Valarcher et al. 2000). However, the UEL04-RP and UEL05-06RP strains, which were derived from the same feedlot and collected at the same time from BRD-affected steers, were 13.3% divergent at the nt level (23% at the aa level) between each other and grouped in different clusters.

We expected to find a conserved hydrophobic domain between residues 173-186; however, substitutions of cysteines and other residues that have a great influence on immunological activity were observed. Additionally, the Brazilian BRSV strains lacked both the Asn179 and Leu183 residues, which were replaced by Lys and Ser, respectively. Cysteine residues are important factors for the intramolecular disulfide bond and steric structure of the protein. Cys173-Cys186 and Cys176\u2013Cys182 constitute the outer and inner disulfide bridges, respectively, while Asn179 is involved in three hydrogen bonds that link the two helices of the Cys176-disulfide bridge via backbone oxygen with the Leu183 amide in the second helix (Doreleijers et al. 1996). In addition, although the cysteine noose was shown to be unnecessary for effective virus infection both in vitro and in vivo (Teng and Collins 2002), it was considered necessary for binding the virus to the cell (Akerlind-Stopner et al. 1990, Valentova et al. 2012). Therefore, it is likely that the lack of the three cysteines that were replaced by Leu, Tyr, and/or Arg and other residue mutations at positions 179 and 183 observed in the Brazilian BRSV strains in this study represent a loss of disulfide bridges and structural changes in the G protein.",

This demonstrated that natural in vivo infections with mutants lacking the four cysteines involved in the two disulfide bridges are possible. In contrast to previous Brazilian studies (Baptista et al. 2017, Headley et al. 2017, 2018), the nasopharyngeal swabs from which these BRSV strains were obtained were negative for other respiratory tract pathogens, suggesting that these Brazilian BRSV strains might have induced the disease. Additionally, BRSV strains in this study were not isolated in cell culture, suggesting that these may be attenuated strains of the virus. Despite the disulfide bridge loss and structural changes in the G protein, it is likely that the pathogenic potential of these BRSV strains was not affected regardless of whether the strains were attenuated. Although studies have shown that the F protein alone is sufficient to mediate attachment and fusion in the absence of G protein (Valarcher et al. 2007), further studies on these Brazilian BRSV strains should be performed to establish their pathogenic potential.",

According to linear epitopes, the point mutations that determine BRSV subgroups are Leu180 for subgroups A and intermediate and Pro180, Ser183, and Pro184 for subgroup B (Langedijk et al. 1997). Substitutions of these residues with Leu180\u2192Pro180, Leu183\u2192Ser183, and/or Ser184\u2192Leu184 were found in the Brazilian BRSV strains in this study. Moreover, an additional mutation, Ala181\u2192Thr181, was also observed in three of these strains. When combined, the expected motifs LACLS (subgroup A), PACSP (subgroup B), and LACSS (intermediate subgroup) at position 180-184 were replaced by different residue combinations, such as PACSL, PARSS, PACSS, PTRSS, and PARSS. Although the antigenic reactivity of the Brazilian BRSV strains in this study has not been analyzed, we presume that these strains present changes in antigenic epitopes that also may influence antibody reactivity and binding. Additional studies based on antigenic properties of these Brazilian BRSV strains should be performed to confirm these hypotheses.",

In this study, the sampled Brazilian cattle herds were not subjected to any direct vaccine selective pressure, and the nt and aa sequences were obtained directly from biological samples of BRD-affected animals, representing wild-type Brazilian BRSV strains with no previous adaption and passages in cell culture. Although BRSV vaccination has been more widely used in Brazil, such vaccination prevents the disease but does not suppress virus circulation (Valarcher et al. 2000). Therefore, the possibility that an indirect vaccination pressure or constant BRSV reinfection has driven mutations in the BRSV strains analyzed in this study cannot be ruled out.",

The identification and characterization of genetically different BRSV subgroups circulating in beef and dairy cattle herds and further studies on their antigenic properties are critical to the adoption of effective strategies for the control and prophylaxis of BRD and to minimize economic losses.
