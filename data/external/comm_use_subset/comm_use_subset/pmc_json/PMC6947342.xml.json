Rapid response to an outbreak caused by an unexpected viral pathogen requires, minimally, the existence of broad-spectrum, antiviral therapeutics. Prevention requires the availability of vaccines, development of which could take years. Indeed, approved vaccines still do not exist to prevent infections by West Nile virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and these outbreaks occurred more than one decade ago.",

One function/mechanism of the RdRp that has been targeted most is that required for faithful incorporation of nucleotides [5,6,7,8,9,10]. Changing RdRp fidelity decreases or increases the genetic variation of the viral population, which, in turn, decreases fitness and virulence of the viral population [11,12,13,14,15,16].",

Replication speed is also a determinant of viral fitness and virulence [18]. So, is it the increased fidelity or decreased speed of nucleotide addition that gives rise to the attenuated phenotype? Further complicating the fidelity-versus-speed question are the recent observations that changes to fidelity also have consequence for the efficiency of recombination [19,20,21,22,23,24]. Increased RdRp fidelity decreases recombination efficiency and vice versa [19,20,21,22,23,24]. It will likely be impossible to attribute a single biochemical property of the RdRp to biological outcome.",

Constructing equivalent substitutions conferring equivalent phenotypes in RdRps other than PV is difficult if not impossible. Our laboratory has therefore pursued active-site-based strategies to manipulate the fidelity, speed, and/or recombination efficiency of the RdRp [25]. We have shown that a lysine (Lys-359 in PV) present in conserved structural motif D of the RdRp contributes to the efficiency of nucleotidyl transfer [25]. A PV mutant encoding a K359R RdRp is attenuated but elicits a protective immune response in mice that is at least as robust as the immune response elicited by the type 1 Sabin vaccine strain [7].",

Unlike the K359R RdRp-encoding virus [7], K359H PV is genetically unstable and acquires mutations encoding two second-site amino acid substitutions after a few passages in cell culture. Together, the two substitutions restore all biochemical properties of the derivative to near wild-type levels. Individually, however, we observe differences in the mechanism (copy-choice vs. forced-copy-choice) and efficiency of recombination by each derivative, although each derivative exhibits equivalent speed and fidelity. We conclude that biochemical properties in addition to speed and fidelity must exist and contribute to both the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The desire to attribute single, biochemical properties of the viral RdRp to fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis may be futile.",

The presence of the desired mutations and the absence of additional mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmid encoding the various mutations was digested and inserted into an intermediate plasmid, pUC18-BglII-EcoRI-3CD (referred as pUC-3CD in [27], and then the fragment between BglII and ApaI was cloned into the subgenomic replicon, pRLucRA, or viral cDNA, pMovRA, or PV1\u0394CRE. PV1\u0394CRE is a full-length PV type 1 (Mahoney) cDNA bearing 8 synonymous substitutions in the oriI cis-acting replication element (CRE) located in the 2C-coding region and was described previously [23]. In order to create a fluorescence-based assay for recombination in cells, we modified the PV1\u0394CRE acceptor RNA to include the coding sequence for UnaG green fluorescent protein. Briefly, UnaG-encoding sequence [28] carrying a 3C protease cleavage site at its carboxyl terminus was inserted between the IRES and the P1 region of the PV sequence. Translation occurred from the natural poliovirus initiation codon. Proteolytic cleavage and release of the fluorescent protein occurred by normal 3C protease activity. Plasmids encoding PV genomes (full length or subgenomic) were linearized with ApaI. All linearized cDNAs were transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA Polymerase and treated with 2U DNAse Turbo (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) to remove residual DNA template. The RNA transcripts were purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) before spectrophotometric quantification. Purified RNA in RNase-free H2O was transfected into either HeLa or L929 fibroblasts using TransMessenger (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Virus yield was quantified by plaque assay. Briefly, cells and media were harvested at 2\u20133 days post-transfection, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and clarified. Supernatant was then used on fresh HeLa cells in 6-well plates; virus infection was allowed to continue for 30 min. Media was then removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) washes before a 0.8% (w/v) agarose-media overlay was added. Cells were incubated for 2\u20133 days and then fixed and stained with crystal violet for virus quantification.",

Almost invariably, the derivatives changed residues remote from the catalytic site, thus using an allosteric mechanism to perturb fidelity. Among the most famous of these is the G64S substitution in PV RdRp [16,17,34]. Many years ago, our laboratory showed that the active site of all polymerases contain a general acid, Lys-359 in the case of PV RdRp, that protonated the pyrophosphate leaving group during nucleotidyl transfer, thereby increasing the catalytic efficiency of RdRp [25]. Substitutions of Lys-359 in PV RdRp give rise to changes in fidelity [7,18]. The arginine substitution of Lys-359 (K359R RdRp) and the histidine substitution (K359H RdRp) catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at a rate 10-fold lower than wild type [25]. The impact of the arginine substitution of Lys-359 on PV fidelity and its potential application to vaccine development have been described [7].",

When PV is rescued from in vitro transcribed RNA, four passages are required for the genetic diversity of the viral population to come to equilibrium [11]. During this time for K359H PV, mutations were observed in RdRp-coding sequence that changed the plaque phenotype of the virus. One change was in motif C, I331F, and the other change was in motif D, P356S (Figure 1A,B). We have adopted the following nomenclature to refer to the various mutant PVs and their corresponding RdRps: I331F-K359H, IF-KH; P356S-K359H, PS-KH; and I331F-P356S-K359H, IF-PS-KH. In order to compare the impact of these substitutions on PV genome replication without complication of reversion, we engineered the various substitutions into a subgenomic replicon, where the capsid coding P1 region was replaced with the gene for firefly luciferase, producing luciferase as an indirect measure of viral RNA produced [39,40,41]. Experiments in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) report on translation of transfected RNA in the absence of replication (Figure 1C). Relative to WT PV, K359H was the most debilitated, with replication failing to reach an end point at 10 h post-transfection (Figure 1C). Each double mutant was markedly better than K359H alone, but the addition of I331F conferred a greater replication advantage than P356S (Figure 1C). The triple mutant replicated even faster but still exhibited a significant reduction in the rate of replication relative to WT (Figure 1C).",

Interestingly, the growth properties of the viruses were not as expected based on the experiments with the replicon. Each mutant virus exhibited the same delay relative to WT virus prior to the first detection of infectious virus after four hours post-infection (hpi) (Figure 2A). Thereafter, growth of each virus was far more distinct than observed for the replicon, with PS-KH PV much slower than IF-KH PV and IF-PS-KH PV was substantially faster than both double mutants (Figure 2A). The differences in outcome could reflect the differences in replication efficiency and/or a direct consequence of the substitutions in 3D-coding sequence on virus assembly or spread caused by changes to 3CD protein or 3D-containing precursor protein [29,42]. After a productive infection, the exponential phase of genome replication by PV typically occurs between 2 and 6 h post-infection, with virus assembly occurring between 4 and 8 h post-infection. Release of infectious virus by lytic and/or non-lytic mechanisms can occur once virus is assembled and can persist for longer than 24 hours. ",

As a result, our experiments generally use genomes instead of PFU as the unit of measure [11]. In doing so, we can use genomes/PFU as a measure of the specific infectivity. The instability of KH PV precluded rigorous, quantitative analysis of this virus, but at least 10-fold more KH PV than WT PV was required to observe a comparable number of plaques. Both substitutions were able to increase the efficiency of plaque formation relative to KH PV (Figure 2B). Indeed, the specific infectivity of IF-KH PV was equivalent to WT. The addition of PS to IF-KH reduced the efficiency of plaque formation; the specific infectivity of IF-PS-KH PV was reduced by twofold relative to IF-KH PV (Figure 2B). Therefore, the behavior of PS-KH PV in the PFU-based growth assay relative to the replicon assay likely reflects an additional defect to virus assembly and/or spread.",

To test this possibility, we evaluated the sensitivity of each virus population to growth in the presence of ribavirin. We reasoned that the mutagenic activity of ribavirin would exhibit the greatest negative impact on viruses with a mutator phenotype as described previously [11]. Relative to WT, K359H PV exhibited the highest fidelity based on the 2-log difference in sensitivity to ribavirin (Figure 2C). IF-KH and PS-KH PVs also exhibited a higher fidelity than WT PV (Figure 2C). Importantly, both mutants exhibited essentially equivalent fidelity phenotypes (Figure 2C), consistent with the suggestion above that the reduced efficiency of plaque formation observed for PS-KH PV is likely related to impairment of virus assembly and/or spread. Finally, evaluation of IF-PS-KH PV revealed equivalent sensitivity of this mutant to ribavirin as observed for WT PV (Figure 2C), suggesting that fidelity had been returned to normal.",

KH PV was unable to produce viable recombinants, as expected for a high-fidelity RdRp [23]. The first surprise was that IF-KH and PS-KH PVs did not exhibit the same phenotypes (Figure 3B). While IF-KH PV produced viable recombinant virus, PS-KH PV did not (Figure 3B). Based on the experiments performed above, these viruses and their polymerases replicate with comparable efficiency and fidelity (Figure 1A and Figure 2C,D). Even more surprising, however, was the observation that IF-PS-KH PV was impaired more than one log relative to WT PV in its ability to produce viable recombinants (Figure 3B). The replication efficiency and fidelity of this virus and its polymerase were always within twofold of that observed for WT (Figure 1A and Figure 2C,D). Together, these results suggest that there are properties of the PV RdRp important for recombination that are not revealed by our existing biological and biochemical assays.",

It was possible that PS-KH PV was defective for virus assembly and/or spread, at least lytic spread (Figure 2B). In order to score for recombinant viruses that spread by either a lytic or non-lytic mechanism, we engineered the acceptor template to encode the UnaG [28] green fluorescent protein (Figure 3C). The polyprotein was designed such that UnaG protein is released from capsid precursor protein by 3C protease activity. Observation of green cells were visible from a donor-acceptor pair producing WT RdRp as early as 7 hpi, with increases continuing over a 48-h period (Figure 3D). With the sensitivity of this assay and the absence of a requirement for lytic spread, it is clear that PS-KH PV exhibits a recombination defect (Figure 3D).",

Both KH and PS-KH RdRps were impaired for poly (rU) polymerase activity, both IF-KH and IF-PS-KH RdRps exhibited near-WT levels of poly (rU) polymerase activity (Figure 4B).

However, in the few instances in which RdRp derivatives exhibiting perturbed fidelity have been characterized, these derivatives also exhibit changes to the rate of nucleotide addition [7,11,18,23,43]. Relative to wild-type polymerase, a higher fidelity polymerase is a slower enzyme, and a lower fidelity polymerase is a faster enzyme [7,11,18,23,43]. Polymerase speed will clearly determine replication kinetics and therefore can contribute to viral fitness, as has been suggested recently [18]. The most extensively characterized fidelity mutants of PV harbor an RdRp with a substitution located at a remote site that likely causes substantial collateral damage, further confounding the fidelity-versus-speed debate [5,17]. This study was motivated by the need to better understand the relationship between the biochemical properties of the viral RdRp and viral fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis. We have had in hand for a long time a PV mutant whose speed and fidelity were perturbed by changing an RdRp active-site residue, K359H [25]. We did not publish this PV mutant until now because of its genetic instability (Figure 1A). We realized that this genetic instability might actually represent an opportunity, as the biochemical phenotypes reverted by the second-site suppressors might highlight the biochemical properties driving viral fitness.",

The K359H substitution will change the efficiency of that protonation event for two reasons. First, the pKa value of histidine is substantially lower than lysine and will therefore not be protonated to the same extent. Second, the distance between the nucleotide phosphates and the imidazole ring of the histidine will be greater than that of the amino group of lysine. It is likely that the distance is more of an issue, because K359R PV is stable and K359R RdRp exhibits the same reduction in catalytic efficiency as K359H RdRp [7]. The changes of I331F and P356S in motifs C and D, respectively, may hypothetically serve to move His-359 closer to the nucleotide phosphates.",

The kinetics of virus production for the different mutants did not correspond directly to the kinetics of replication (compare Figure 2A to Figure 1C). Virus production was significantly delayed for PS-KH PV (Figure 2A). This issue with virus production manifests as a substantial decrease in the specific infectivity of this virus (Figure 2B). One possible explanation for this outcome is that the RdRp is encoded by the 3D region of the viral genome and this region is also a component of the PV 3CD protein. The 3CD protein has well established roles in aspects of the lifecycle before, during, and after replication, including virion morphogenesis [29,42,50,51]. Observations such as these highlight the additional level of complexity associated with establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between biochemical properties of the RdRp and fitness, virulence, and/or pathogenesis.",

An unexpected outcome of this study was the observation that IF-KH and PS-KH PVs exhibit substantially different propensities for recombination in cells (Figure 3B), in spite of very similar speed and fidelity phenotypes in cells (Figure 1C and Figure 2C) and in vitro (Figure 2D). PS-KH PV appeared to be completely incapable of supporting recombination in cells (Figure 3B). Because the cell-based recombination assay requires the ability of virus to plaque, it was conceivable that the defect of PS-KH PV was more a reflection of virus spread than impaired recombination. We established a more sensitive fluorescence-based assay (Figure 3C), which also indicated impaired recombination (Figure 3D). The impact of the PS substitution on recombination was also quite evident in the context of IF-PS-KH PV. The biological and biochemical properties of this triple mutant are within twofold of wild type (Figure 1 and Figure 2), but the recombination efficiency of this mutant is down by 30-fold relative to WT PV (Figure 3B). Together, these observations support the existence of biochemical properties of the RdRp other than speed and fidelity that are essential for recombination and impaired by changing Pro-356 to Ser. Further characterization of these mutants will be required to identify this undefined biochemical property.",

            "text": "Our laboratory has had a longstanding interest in the mechanism of recombination [19,20,23,32,45]. We have shown that the high poly (rU) polymerase activity of PV RdRp derives from template switching during elongation, thus mimicking copy-choice recombination (Figure 4A) [32]. A second assay that we developed is based on template switching from the end of template, thus mimicking forced-copy-choice recombination (Figure 5A) [23,45]. Based on the mutants and corresponding RdRp derivatives reported here, high fidelity impairs both types of recombination (see K359H in Figure 4B and Figure 5D). Interestingly, unique RdRp determinants exist for each mode of recombination. PS-KH RdRp is impaired for copy-choice recombination (Figure 4B); IF-KH is impaired for forced-copy-choice recombination (Figure 5D). Impairment of recombination by PS-KH PV in cells is consistent with template switching as the primary mechanism of copy-choice recombination in cells, as demonstrated by Kirkegaard and Baltimore [44]. The observation that IF-KH PV fails to exhibit a wild-type recombination phenotype (Figure 3B) may suggest that forced-copy-choice recombination contributes to recombination in cells as well.",

There are known and unknown biochemical properties of the RdRp that determine recombination efficiency, and there are at least two distinct mechanisms of recombination. Without understanding the biochemical properties of the mutants under investigation, it is difficult to compare one study to another that may explain disparate observations made between laboratories [30,55]. Further analysis of the panel of mutants reported here may help to resolve the controversy but should illuminate how changes to the mechanism and efficiency of recombination impact viral evolution in a background of constant speed and fidelity.",

The conserved structure, dynamics, and mechanism of the viral RdRp makes this enzyme an attractive target for development of attenuated viruses by changing conserved residues capable of perturbing conserved, biochemical function [7,9,11]. As a field, we have focused on RdRp fidelity [7] but have come to the realization that RdRp speed should not be ignored [18]. This study shows that speed, fidelity, and undefined biochemical properties of the RdRp exist and contribute to both the mechanism and efficiency of recombination (Figure 6). This inextricable connection of the myriad biochemical properties of the RdRp precludes attribution of a single biochemical property to viral fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis (Figure 6). The field will be served best by continued emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp, and other viral enzymes, instead of debating the importance of individual properties.",

(A) The heteropolymeric, symmetrical, primed-template substrate (sym/sub) has been used to establish an assay for forced-copy-choice recombination in vitro [23,45]. RdRp assembles on sym/sub. ATP is added and incorporated to yield a stable elongation complex. It is this elongation complex that is monitored for extension and transfer. Transfer is strictly dependent on the presence of an acceptor RNA with complementarity to the 3\u2032-end of donor RNA. (B) Schematic of the experimental design is indicated. Products in boxes are those observed and monitored by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (C) Reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis and detected by phosphorimaging. The only regions of the gel with bands are shown; these correspond to the sym/sub primer, one-nucleotide-extended primer (n+1), four-nucleotides-extended product (strong stop) and non-templated addition of nucleotides to that product, and the transfer product. (D) Transfer products were quantified and are expressed as a percentage relative to the value observed for WT (The concentrations (\u00b5M) of n+1 formed for WT, K359H, IF-KH, PS-KH and IF-PS-KH are 0.22, 0.22, 0.32, 0.36, and 0.37, respectively. The concentrations (\u00b5M) of transfer product for WT, K359H, IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH are 0.011, 0.00011, 0.0016, 0.0072, and 0.01, respectively. Overall, transfer efficiency ranges from 1% to 5%. Error bars represent SEM (n = 3). Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired, two-tailed t-test (** significance level p = 0.0001).",

            "text": "Figure 6: The biochemical properties of the RdRp are inextricably linked and collectively determine biological outcomes. PV RdRp is among the most extensively studied enzyme both in cells and in test tubes [5]. A vast majority of these studies have emphasized elaboration of mechanisms governing efficient incorporation of nucleotides (speed) with high specificity (fidelity). Whether or not speed is a consequence of fidelity, vice versa, or completely separable is not clear [18,43,56,57,58]. However, these two parameters are linked to recombination efficiency. Moreover, the studies reported herein point to the existence of a biochemical property other than speed and fidelity, referred to here as undefined, that contributes to recombination efficiency. Together, the observations reported herein demonstrate that the current state of the art precludes association of a single biochemical property to viral fitness, virulence, and/or pathogenesis.",
