Since the early 1970s in the UK, the European badger (Meles meles) has been implicated as a reservoir for bTB in cattle [13]. Since then, badgers have been culled as part of attempts to control the disease in cattle, although the incidence of bTB in UK cattle herds has continued to increase [14]\u2013[16]; although the effects of previous culling policies have been difficult to determine, since they were not carried out as scientific trials [14]. In 1998, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), was initiated to quantify the impact of badger culling on cattle herd breakdown rates [15], following the recommendations of a UK Government review [14].",

Evidence from field studies suggests that this pattern of social organisation mitigates the spread of bTB between groups, and that disease transmission rates between social groups are lower than those within groups [19], [20]. The perturbation hypothesis predicts that culling may affect social behaviour in ways that alter bTB epidemiology among the survivors [4], [7], [21], [22]. The effects of culling induced perturbation might take various forms, and in the case of badgers [7], [23] might alter the rate of inter-group disease transmission, by for example changing rates of inter-group movements and interactions [24] and hence the contact between potentially susceptible and infected non-group members [4], [25], including aggressive interactions and bite wounding [26], [27].",

Dispersal by both sexes has been argued to maximise potential breeding opportunities [24], [28], [29], though extra-group mating may be common [30]. The epidemiological consequences of dispersal will depend on the contacts made between dispersers and members of the recipient social group [8], [11]. The movement of infected individuals as a mechanism for disease spread underpins much epidemiological theory [31], [32] as illustrated, for example, by foot and mouth disease [33], bovine tuberculosis in cattle [34] and possums [35], Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [36] and prion disease in deer [37]. In the case of badgers, movement at both the individual and social group level have been identified as risk factors for bTB [38]. Behavioural heterogeneities and variability in contact rates between individuals are known to affect patterns of disease spread, particularly from studies of human sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhoea [39] and, more recently HIV [9]. At the popualtion level, Rogers et al. [24] reported that bTB incidence in the Woodchester Park badger population was positively correlated with the rate of individual movement between social groups.",

In our study although inter-group movementss (IGMs) by badgers were rare, they increased significantly following culling. This usually involved the movement of animals into groups that had been subjected to culling either from other culled groups or their unculled immediate neighbours. The prevalence of detectable M. bovis infection from culture of clinical samples increased from 1% to 14% in Neighbouring groups following culling and this increase tended to be greater in groups involved in IGMs, whether as donors or receivers. The culture of clinical samples alone may prove insensitive, partly due to the potential for intermittent shedding of bacilli by badgers [48], [49], although this was not observed in this population [21]. Although the culture of clinical samples will have under-estimated true levels of M. bovis infection in badgers in this study, this effect will have been consistent and so does not invalidate comparison of relative levels of disease in space and time.",

Our results were not consistent with this prediction, with instead there being a pervasive emergence of bTB across the badger population following culling [21]. While detectable bTB prevalence tended to increase in IGM receiver groups, no infection was detected in animals moving into these groups following culling, and prevalence in donor Neighbouring groups also tended to increase. It is plausible that animals detected making IGMs were infectious, but were not detected by the culture test because they were not shedding bacilli at the time of capture [50]. Furthermore, animals other than those captured will have been making IGMs, and some of them may have also been infectious. Nonetheless, the previously reported apparent absence of association between post-culling bTB infection and bite wounding, and the emergence of bTB infection in cubs [21] suggest that perturbation may act indirectly. For example, post-culling disturbance of the social structure of the badger population could potenitally cause sufficient stress to individuals to induce immunosuppression [21], [51], [52]. This could in turn result in the expression of latent disease already existing within badger social groups [53], or heightened susceptibility to infection from bacilli surviving in badger setts and elsewhere in the environment [54], [55]. In such circumstances, cubs may provide a useful barometer for the potential role of social stress in bTB infection, since their immune systems are immature and they consequently have lower resistance to disease [53], [56], [57].",

In a separate study of three geographically distinct populations no consistent patterns of bite wounding were observed, suggesting that local conditions may be of particular importance [26].

In Other groups there was a behavioural response to culling, with increases in home range size and overlap between individuals from Neighbouring and Other groups. The IGM rate increased between Neighbouring and Removed groups following culling, with the majority of movements being into Removed groups. IGMs in the control area, and prior to culling in the treatment area, were rare. Animals were more likely to move from larger groups, with no effect of sex or age. This contrasts with the observations of Tuyttens et al. [40] in North Nibley, Gloucestershire, where young females were found to move into setts in the year afer culling had taken place. Similarly, after a badger removal operation (BRO) near Woodchester in Gloucestershire, female badgers recolonised cleared setts in greater numbers than did males in the first six years following culling [25]. However, unlike the present study, both the North Nibley and Woodchester BROs involved virtually all badgers being removed from the targeted social groups. Culling operations in the present study however, removed approximately 40% of animals from targeted groups, with sufficient individuals remaining to produce cubs in the following breeding season [21]. Estimated capture rates of badgers from other triplet areas in the RBCT were measured as an index of the proportion of available traps that caught badgers [58], and varied from 5.4% to 11.8% (8.8% on average; Triplet E = 7.7%). These indices were not directly calibrated with badger population density and so comparison here is problematic. Culling was deemed to have affected a number of indirect indices of badger abundance in both proactive and, to a lesser degree, reactive treatments [58]. Differences in the intensity of culling may thus influence the movement behaviour of individuals from surrounding groups and hence the strength of any perturbation effect on population recovery and bTB epidemiology.",

Adult badgers were selected for radio-collaring based on existing collars within the same social group, spatial proximity of collared animals from adjacent social groups, and sex. The objective was to obtain a wide distribution of several clusters of collared animals of approximately equal sex ratio. Clusters were initiated by the opportunistic capture of two more adults of different sex from a social group. On subsequent trapping occasions, adults captured from these social groups, and their immediate neighbours, were collared preferentially, until two animals of each sex had been collared from each social group. This event only occurred at two social groups; one in the treatment area and one in the control area. Clustering collared animals over three or four neighbouring social groups provided the ability to examine overlap and interactions between individuals from different groups. The wide distribution of these clusters minimised bias due to the locations of (at that time, unpredictable) reactive culling operations which might have subsequently taken place within the treatment study area. Radio-collars were also deployed opportunistically as the need arose when practicalities thwarted adherence to the decision strategy, such as a lack of candidate individuals from a particular social group.",

Residency may be defined usefully as an individual being trapped consistently within the same social group [24], [29]. An animal would thus be identified as a mover if it fulfilled the residency criterion at more than one social group. Here we used the term \u2018inter-group movements\u2019 (IGM), based on both trapping and radio tracking data. An IGM was defined as occurring when a badger was either captured at a sett belonging to a different group than that at which it was captured previously, or when it was located at a sett belonging to a different group by night-time radio-tracking or daytime positioning.",
