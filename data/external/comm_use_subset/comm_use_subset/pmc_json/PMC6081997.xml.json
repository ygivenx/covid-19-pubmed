Vaccination as an intervention for the control of viral respiratory infections faces considerable hurdles. These include continuous or rapid pathogen evolution (e.g. influenza)\n8,\n9, high serotype diversity (e.g. rhinovirus)\n10 or target populations not appropriate for current vaccines (e.g. RSV)\n11. Consequently, innovation in vaccination strategies for these pathogens (e.g. targeting of schools and households), mass use of antivirals or non-pharmacological methods such as social distancing (e.g. school closures), are options to consider. Designing strategies to control respiratory viruses would be assisted by detailed knowledge of the patterns of spread, i.e. of distinct pathways of transmission in communities, at various social organizational levels from the household, school, local community, nationally and beyond country boundaries.",
