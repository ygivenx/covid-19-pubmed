It has a strong capability of spreading globally, leading to adverse health effects [1]. Such respiratory diseases are usually caused by type A or type B influenza, and the symptoms include headache, muscle aches, cough, and sudden fever [2]. Infection by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus emerged initially in Mexico in early 2009 and has become a global pandemic [3-5]. Now, influenza A (H1N1, H3N2 and pandemic (H1N1) 2009) and influenza B have induced co-infection worldwide, thereby causing considerable panic among general populations.",

Amantadine and rimantadine, however, have been associated with neurologic toxicities and gastrointestinal side effects [7]. Moreover, overuse of these medicines has been found to result in drug-resistant strains [8]. Up to 2003, M2-resistant variants had even spread to countries where these drugs are used infrequently [9]. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has demonstrated resistance to amantadine and rimantadine [10,11]. Our previous study suggested that clinical isolates of H1N1 and H3N2 developed amantadine resistance at 93.1% and 100%, respectively, in Guangzhou, China [12]. NA inhibitors, in comparison with M2 ion channel blockers, are more commonly used but they (i) can also cause respiratory side effects and even death (for example, oseltamivir [13]) owing to intensive use and (ii) have a higher barrier for resistance if overused. A survey from 1999 and 2007 showed a very low level (<1%) of resistance to oseltamivir [10,14], but a survey between 2008 and 2009 reported the resistance to be \u226590% [15-18]. Resistance to zanamivir has been (albeit rarely) reported among immunodeficient patients [19,20]. Whether such antiviral agents can be used to address influenza epidemics is not clear. Furthermore, the true effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment against influenza is controversial [21].",

Inhibiting the hemagglutinin (HA) of the virus at its early stage of infection is an important antiviral mechanism of IIR [24-26]. In vivo experiments revealed clemastanin B to significantly inhibit pneumonia and virus proliferation in lung tissue (Zifeng Yang and Zhengtu Li, unpublished work). We also found that the lignin group (IIR isolated) inhibits the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling activated by the influenza virus and blocks exportation of the NP protein of the influenza virus (article in press). Other studies have also shown that indirubin (also contains IIR) and its derivatives have antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in infection due to the influenza A (H5N1) virus [27].",
