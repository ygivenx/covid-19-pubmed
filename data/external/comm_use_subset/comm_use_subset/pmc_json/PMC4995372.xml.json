The results showed that luciferase activity was significantly enhanced using the pFcRn-luc-1, pFcRn-luc-2 and pFcRn-luc-3 constructs during TGEV infection compared with mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells, while the luciferase reporter construct harboring the shortest fragment of pFcRn-luc-4 had not significant differences comparing with mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 4B).",

We searched for putative NF-\u03baB-binding sequence(s) along this promoter region (\u22121381~\u2212208). Computational inspection revealed that the promoter of the pFcRn gene contained sequences with a similarity to the NF-\u03baB consensus sequence (Fig. 5A). We used a ChIP assay to verify that these putative NF-\u03baB binding sequences had the capability to directly bind NF-\u03baB proteins in living cells. First, cross-linking the DNA with bound NF-\u03baB proteins in situ in TGEV infection verus mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells, NF-\u03baB-DNA complexes were co-incubated with p65 specific antibody. Then, the purified DNA fragments were measured by PCR. As shown in Fig. 5B, PCR with specific primers (Table 1) produced a band from DNA coprecipitated with p65 (Fig. 5B, \u22121286, \u22121128, \u2212642 and \u2212563), however the sequence (\u2212894) failed to produced a band. In a negative control, immunoprecipitation with normal mouse IgG did not generate any corresponding PCR products (Fig. 5B, lane 3).

While our research mainly concentrated on the classical NF-\u03baB pathway, its activity can be modulated significantly by additional factors that transfer into the nucleus and bind to NF-\u03baB binding sequences. In this regard, we analyzed the 5\u2032-flanking region of the pFcRn gene. and found there are several other transcriptional factors in this region, such as AP-1 and Sp1. Some studies have suggested that NF-\u03baB dimers can act synergistically with AP-1 and Sp1 transcriptional factors to influence gene regulation363738.
