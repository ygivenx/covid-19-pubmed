We asked methodologists with experience in applying the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach that was officially adopted by WHO to participate in the creation of evidence profiles and the guideline development process. Thirteen voting panel members supplemented by WHO experts participated in the panel meeting. We followed a thorough process to declare conflicts of interest (see Text S1 under Supporting Information).",

The GRADE approach required the identification of relevant outcomes to be included in each evidence profile before developing the evidence profiles. Two reviewers identified potentially important outcomes and this list was circulated to the panel chair, WHO staff, and the scientific reviewers by email for independent scoring of the relative importance of each outcome and identification of additional potentially important outcomes. Outcomes were rated on a scale from 1\u20139; a rating of 7\u20139 indicated that the outcome was critical for a decision or recommendation, 4\u20136 indicated it was important, and 1\u20133 indicated it was not important. The evidence profiles included only critical or important outcomes based on the mean value of the ratings by the panel members.",

The panel evaluated the rationale for the quality rating during the meeting and subsequently via electronic correspondence. The reasons for considering the evidence to be of low or very low quality (i.e., for having little confidence in the available estimates of effect) were: (1) the lack of direct evidence from trials among patients with H5N1 infection or exposure, (2) lack of evidence for important outcomes for H5N1 infection that were not common or not measured in seasonal influenza trials, and (3) sparse data for other important outcomes. Additional factors and specific judgments regarding the quality of the evidence are included in detailed footnotes in the evidence profiles. The panel expressed concern about the categories used to grade the quality of evidence. For example, although the quality of the evidence for treatment and chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir and zanamivir was very low for both, there was nonetheless a difference in the quality of the evidence within the categories for these two drugs.",

The arguments for making strong recommendations for specific interventions, despite the low quality of the available evidence, were the high risk of serious outcomes including death, the lack of alternative treatments, a low risk of serious adverse effects based on the available evidence, relatively low costs, and a possibility of beneficial effects, although there is much uncertainty about these. The strong recommendation regarding treatment of H5N1 patients with oseltamivir required a vote (one panel member abstained and one voted for a weak recommendation). The main argument that led to voting about this recommendation was that it is uncertain whether the intervention does more good than harm in the face of very low-quality evidence. Only one other recommendation required voting. Other factors that influenced the recommendations, value judgments, and other directly relevant information are described in the remark sections following each recommendation [21].",

In addition, the approach used in developing these guidelines included transparent consideration of the key factors that determine the strength of a recommendation. The rapid preparation of evidence profiles was possible because of the availability of high-quality systematic reviews of the evidence from seasonal influenza and the involvement of a review team with experience in preparing evidence profiles and relevant clinical expertise. In the absence of higher-quality direct evidence, the panel considered case reports, animal studies, and in vitro studies for H5N1, as well as the available indirect evidence from systematic reviews of clinical trials for seasonal influenza, systematically and transparently.",

Thus, the time available for developing these guidelines did not permit detailed consideration of all clinical questions that clinicians may face. For example, the discussions about whether to use prophylactic antibiotics and which recommendations apply to situations of human-to-human transmission were short and, therefore, did not result in specific recommendations. It is unlikely that important evidence that would have led to different recommendations was missed given the nature of the problem; i.e., an emerging disease. In areas with an ample evidentiary base, evidence could be missed by relying on systematic reviews of the indirect evidence. However, this generally should not be the case when rapid advice is needed. It is not clear whether the differences the panel identified within the category of very low-quality evidence are truly important for decision making, but panel members requested that this information should not be lost in translating the quality of evidence into the four categories based on the GRADE approach.",
