            "text": "Rotavirus is still one of the leading causes of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children under the age of five and causes the deaths of 453,000 children younger than 5 years annually [1]. Rotaviruses, belonging to a genus of double-stranded RNA viruses in the family Reoviridae, infect the mature villous epithelial cells of the small intestine, often leading to fever, vomiting, and diarrhea in children. For the treatment of rotavirus gastroenteritis, intravenous fluid administration has been used successfully in treating only the direct consequences of the dehydration from diarrhea. Gastrogard-R\u00ae is a prophylactic treatment of \u2018at risk\u2019 children aged one month to three years to prevent diarrhea due to rotavirus infection and the efficacy of treatment was established in a clinical trial in children aged 3 to 15 months [2]. Gastrogard-R\u00ae is prepared from the colostrum of hyperimmunised cows and contains immunoglobulins against serotypes G1 and G3 of the human rotavirus. We have demonstrated in an in vivo rotavirus infection mouse model that Gastrogard-R\u00ae is able to completely inhibit rotavirus-induced diarrhea in suckling mice [3]. A first generation of licensed rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market a year after introduction due to a possible correlation between vaccine application and the occurrence of intussusceptions [4]. Two live-attenuated vaccines have been licensed recently and have so far proven safe and highly efficacious in developed countries. In developing countries, clinical trials are being undertaken and early results found that the vaccine significantly reduces severe diarrhea episodes due to rotavirus (48.3% for Asia and 30.2% for Africa) [5]. However, rotavirus vaccines are expensive and may not be affordable for the developing world at present, compromising full vaccine coverage. This has reinforced the need to develop alternative approaches to control rotavirus disease. Natural compounds have been identified as ideal candidates for antiviral drugs because they are cheaper and effective [6]. To date, many natural compounds have known antirotavirus effects in clinical studies [7-9], in animal experiments [10] and in vitro[11-14]. In the current study we investigated 150 edible plant extracts and some of their natural compounds for in vitro anti-rotavirus infection effects.",

Trypsin usually is added during infection of MA104 cells with rotavirus to increase the infectivity [16-18]. Intestinal epithelial permeability studies are often performed with human Caco-2 cells [19]. These cells develop polarization of distinct apical and basolateral surfaces separated by tight junctions at areas of cell-to-cell contact closely resembling the physiological situation in the intestine. The transepithelial resistance (TER) is a measure for the tightness of the tight junctions formed by Caco-2 cells. Rotaviruses are known to infect epithelial cells of the small intestine and in vitro rotavirus infection of Caco-2 cells caused disruption of tight junctions and loss of TER in the absence of cell death [20]. To investigate whether the loss of TER could be prevented, Caco-2 cells were infected with SA-11 rotavirus in the presence of hyperimmune colostrum (Gastrogard-R\u00ae), plant extracts or pure compounds. From both models, the results of 150 aqueous plant extracts on their antiviral action against rotavirus are presented in a search for novel agents for the treatment of human diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection.",

Ltd., Mysore District, Karnataka State, India) consisting of 10,000 herbal extracts. In a set-up for high throughput screening, all plant extracts were tested as a first screening in an antiviral titration assay with MA104 cells in the concentrations of 400 and 500 \u03bcg/ml in medium. When an inhibition of infection was determined (<20% inhibition), a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was calculated. Extracts that reduced the rotavirus infection were studied further in two concentrations close to the calculated IC50. Extracts unable to inhibit the infection were appointed an arbitrary IC50 of 1000 \u03bcg/ml. A complete list of tested herbal extracts is listed in Additional file 1. Synergy between two plant extracts was investigated in the titration assay by assaying the separate compounds as well as combinations hereof on the same plate. The separate compounds were tested in the calculated IC50 concentration whereas the combination a mixture was of the IC25 concentration of both extracts. 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was tested in the concentrations of 10-20-30-40-50-100 \u03bcM in medium.

One electrode of the epithelial volt-ohm meter (World Precision Instuments, Sarasota, USA) was placed into the apical compartment of a transwell system (Corning Life Sciences, New Jersey, USA) and the other into the basolateral compartment. The electrical resistance is then measured across the cell monolayer after the passage of a defined current pulse. Experiments were carried out at two weeks post confluency with fully differentiated cells. One day before infection, the Caco-2 cells were cultured in medium without FCS. Prior to infection, the SA-11 rotavirus inoculum was activated for 20 min by treatment with 0.5 mg trypsin/ml (Invitrogen). The Caco-2 cells were apically infected with an inoculum of activated rotavirus (1*106 CCID50) in the presence of the extract and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The integrity of the confluent polarized monolayer was checked by measuring TER with a volt-ohmmeter. TER (in units of ohm times centimeters squared) was calculated as the measured electrical resistance times the surface area of a filter. The background reading of a control filter was measured in every experiment. Infections were carried out in triplicates and all measurements were done at various time points post infection. The permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayer was also determined by measuring the paracellular passage of HRP or FITC-dextran from apical to the basolateral compartments of the culture chamber. The concentrations of FITC-dextran were determined by measuring the fluorescence at \u03bbexcitation 485 nm and \u03bbemission 520 nm. The concentration of HRP was determined by incubating 50 \u03bcl of the sample with 50 \u03bcl TMB for 10 min at RT.

            "text": "Recently, there is a growing interest in the interaction between pharmacology and nutrition science. Pharmaceuticals are generally developed to treat, cure or prevent disease and the primary goal of nutrition is to maintain or even improve health. This does not imply that there is no role for nutrition in preventing or curing disease [22]. The 150 plant extracts used in the screening here were selected because of their known nutritional uses. The nutritional applications and antiviral activities of the five strongest rotavirus inhibitors are discussed. Nelumbo nucifera (sacred water lotus) is not a well known food ingredient in Europe, but in Asia the roots are often eaten as a vegetable in soups, deep-fried, stir-fried and braised dishes. Nelumbo nucifera is known to have antiviral action against HIV [23] and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) [24]. Aspalathus linearis leaves are used to make redbush tea which has been popular in Southern Africa for generations and is now consumed in many countries. No antiviral activity has been reported yet for Aspalathus linearis. Urtica dioica (stinging nettle) can be used in a variety of recipes and nettle soup is a common use of the plant, particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe. In Nepal and Northern India it is a very popular vegetable and cooked with Indian spices. Known antiviral actions of Urtica dioica are inhibition of both HIV and FIV, the feline variant of HIV [25,26]. Glycyrrhiza glabra is also known as European licorice and the root extract is used as flavoring in sweets, baked goods, ice cream and soft drinks. Only one other member of the Glycyrrhiza sp., Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Chinese licorice) was already know from literature to have antiviral activity against rotavirus [27]. Glycyrrhiza glabra itself is known to have inhibitory activity against several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses [28-30]. Olea europeae fruit (olive) is of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil. Olea europeae exhibits antiviral activity against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV) [31]. For these nutritional ingredients we have demonstrated antirotavirus activity in vitro. This illustrates the potential for the use of specific plant extracts for treatment or prevention of rotavirus illness.",

Glycyrrhizic acid is one of the bioactive compounds of licorice roots and is composed of one molecule of 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid, which has a steroid-like structure, and two molecules of glucuronic acid. Lin et al. reported 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid to have a stronger action against Epstein-Barr virus than its parental compound glycyrrhizic acid [32]. Two constituents of Aspalathus linearis, luteolin and vitexin, also showed antiviral activity against rotavirus in the antiviral titration assay. Luteolin is a flavonoid most often found in leaves and vitexin is an apigenin flavone glucoside. Both compounds are found in many different plant species other than Aspalathus. The weakest inhibitor was apigenin 7-O-glucoside, also a flavonoid and can be found in for example lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), chamomile (Chamomilla recutita) and celery (Apium graveolens). So far as we know this is the first study showing that luteolin, vitexin and apigenin 7-O-glucoside have antiviral activity in vitro. Although the mechanism of action has yet to be defined, this is a first step in a potential wider, more pharmacological use of these nutritional ingredients. The possibility that there are other active compounds present in the positive plant extracts has to be further investigated. The positive control hyperimmune colostrum (HIC) showed inhibitory action against rotavirus infection in both the antiviral titration assay with RRV in MA104 cells as well as in maintaining the TER in Caco-2 cells infected with SA-11. In synergism studies, where the extracts have been combined in the IC25 concentration, synergism in antiviral activity was found in the combinations Glycyrrhiza glabra L. + Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. and Urtica dioica L. + Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. The separate extracts with IC50 concentration showed an inhibition of infection of about 50%. Both combinations in the IC25 concentration of the extracts showed an inhibition of more than 50%, respectively 89% and 86%. This indicates that the extracts in the combination have different antiviral actions. This illustrates the importance for further research into the mechanism of action of the individual ingredients, as well as in vivo validation of the antiviral capacity.",

Therefore a crude extract reaching the IC50 of <0.3 mg/ml was regarded as a strong inhibitor. Moreover, it is specified that each extract and active compound has its own bioavailability and activity in vivo[35].

Cho et all. showed that absorption enhancers like 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid and taurine can decrease TER of Caco-2 cells and increase the permeability in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner [36]. These results indicate that absorption enhancers can widen the tight junction even without rotavirus infection.
