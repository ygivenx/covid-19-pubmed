            "text": "Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is one of the well-known pattern recognition receptors [1], sensing single-stranded RNA viruses via the recognition of the viral RNA genome [2]. Binding of the ligand to the TLR extracellular domain causes the homodimerization of TLRs via further interaction of the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, then activates myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent and/or TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF)-dependent pathways [1,3]. In the MyD88-dependent pathway, the complex of MyD88 with activated TLR dimers, except for TLR3, recruits IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-4, then leads IRAK4 to activate other members of the IRAK, like IRAK1 and IRAK2. The activated IRAKs directly interact with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 (E3 ubiquitin ligase) plus E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc13 and Uev1A, resulting in Lys63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, IRAKs and TGF-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) [4]. In the TRIF-dependent pathway, activated TLR3 directly binds TRIF, resulting in the activation of TRIF connecting with TRAF3 to turn on TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKs for IRF3/7 phosphorylation [4,5]. Alternatively, TRIF associates with RIP1 and then forms the complex along with TRAF6 for activation of TAK1. Ubiquitin-activated TAK1 phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and I\u03baB-kinases (IKKs), initiating AP-1, NF-\u03baB and IRF3/7 signaling on the production of cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons (IFNs).",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes the pro-inflammatory cytokine storms, recruitment of immune responder cells into the lungs, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even lung fibrosis in the late phase [6,7]. Among 14 ORFs encoded by SARS-CoV [8,9], ORF1a/ORF1ab is the biggest one encoding polyprotein replicases 1a and 1ab, primarily involved in SARS-CoV replication. Specifically, ORF1a-encoded papain-like protease (PLPro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) process cis- and trans-cleavage activities on replicases 1a and 1ab for creating 16 nonstructural (NS) proteins (termed NS 1 through NS16). PLPro, recognizing a consensus motif LXGG as a de-ubiquitinating/de-ISGylating enzyme [10,11,12,13], exhibits the antagonistic activities of type I interferon (IFN). PLPro directly interacts with IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to block IRF-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [14,15]. Conversely, another study indicated that type I IFN antagonism of PLPro is not correlated to a direct interaction of PLPro with IRF-3 or affecting the phosphorylation of IRF3, but PLPro suppresses the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by preventing I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation [15]. Recent studies demonstrate that PLPro disrupts the stimulator of interferon gene (STING)-mediated signaling and then negatively regulates type I IFN induction [16,17]. PLPro physically interacts with the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex, reducing the ubiquitinated forms of STING, RIG-I, TRAF3, TBK1 and IRF-3. Similarly, de-ubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling via de-ubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6 [18,19]; de-ubiquitinating protease A20 inhibits NF-\u03baB activation induced by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) via removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF6 [20]. PLPro interacts with above key regulators of TLR signal pathways; thus, characterizing the antagonistic mechanisms of TLR signal pathways by SARS-CoV PLPro could provide valuable insights into SARS pathogenesis.",

Western blot analysis showed a 60-kDa band recombinant PLPro protein in transfected cells, but not controls, as well as the similar expression level of TLR7 in both types of cells (Figure 1A), demonstrating that SARS-CoV PLPro was stably expressed in human promonocyte cells that did not alter the TLR7 expression. Quantitative real-time PCR signified TLR7 agonist treatment stimulating higher transcriptional levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in vector controls than in PLPro-expressing cells (Figure 1B,C). Western blotting analysis of both of these cells indicated that IRF3 phosphorylation in vector control cells reached a maximum level at 30 min, but disappeared at 60 min after IMQ treatment. Importantly, PLPro inhibited IMQ-induced activation of IRF3 phosphorylation since no significant change in IRF3 phosphorylation was detectable at 30 min after IMQ treatment compared to non-treatment (Figure 1D). To assess the functional activity of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 induced by TLR7 agonist, the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) reporter of the dual-luciferase assay was further performed (Figure 2A). The TLR7 agonist dose-dependently triggered the ISRE promoter activity in vector control cells, but not in PLPro-expressing cells (Figure 2A). Quantitative real-time PCR signified that the TLR7 agonist dose-dependently upregulated the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including PKR and IRF7, in vector controls, but not PLPro-expressing cells (Figure 2B,C). In addition, TLR7 agonist-induced activation of STAT1 was delayed and suppressed by SARS-CoV PLPro (Figure 2D). Results revealed that PLPro suppresses TLR7 agonist-induced production of type I IFNs through inhibiting the IRF-3 activation in the TLR7 signaling pathway.",

Results indicated that SARS-CoV PLPro inhibits TLR7 agonist-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and AP1 promoters, which was associated with reducing the stimulated upregulation of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA (Figure 3A,B and Figure 4A\u2013C). To explore the inhibitory effect of PLPro on NF-\u03baB and AP1 signals, the levels of NF-\u03baB p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun phosphorylation were subsequently detected in responses to TLR7 agonist using Western blotting (Figure 3C and Figure 4D, respectively). Western blotting demonstrated that PLPro suppressed TLR7 agonist-induced phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB, p38 MAPK and c-Jun compared to those in the vector control at 30 min post-treatment. The results demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLPro suppressed TLR7-induced cytokines through decreasing the phospho-NF-\u03baB p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun, resulting in suppressing of the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 signaling pathway.",

Immunoprecipitation assays indicated that PLPro decreased the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF3 and TRAF6, causing the decrease in the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF3 and TRAF6, which correlated with lower levels of TBK-1 phosphorylation in PLPro-expressing cells than vector control cells in response to IMQ. PLPro has been reported to upregulate the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25k and proteasome subunit alpha type 5, which resulted in the increase of ERK1 poly-ubiquitination in PLPro-expressing cells as the type I IFN antagonistic mechanism of SARS PLPro via the degradation of ERK1 [24,25]. The high ubiquitination level of TRAF3 and TRAF6 in PLPro-expressing cells (Figure 5A,B) might be responsible for the activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, as demonstrated in our prior reports [24,25]. The finding was also similar to previous reports in that the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV PLPro on the inactivation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB has been demonstrated to correlate with PLPro-reduced ubiquitination of RIG-I, STING TRAF3, TBK1 and IRF3 in the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways [16,17]. These previous reports proposed an antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLPro, including the inhibition of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and STING-TRAF3-TBK1 signaling in the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways. Since TBK1 has been suggested to activate protein phosphatases [26], no detectable level of IRF3 phosphorylation, as well as the decrease of NF-\u03baB p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun phosphorylation in the vector control and PLPro-expressing cells at 60 min post-IMQ treatment (Figure 1D and Figure 3C) could be due to a the negative feedback of the TBK1-IRF3/NF-\u03baB pathways. Therefore, we propose that the inhibition of TRAF3/6-TBK1-IRF3/NF-\u03baB/AP1 signals by PLPro is responsible for the antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLPro against TLR7-medaited production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
