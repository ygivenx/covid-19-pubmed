In the case of infectious diseases, it is customary to measure how far an epidemic is from eradication by calculating yet another epidemiological parameter, the basic reproduction number, denoted by R0 (e.g., [3], pp. 4\u20135). By definition, R0 represents the average number of secondary cases caused by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. If R0 is larger than 1, then an outbreak becomes an epidemic; otherwise, it goes extinct. If the population is not fully susceptible, then one calculates the effective reproduction number, denoted by R [4, 5]. However, neither R0 nor R is regularly monitored by public-health authorities (e.g., [6], pp. 39\u201365).",

In addition, R0 may depend on factors pertaining to host sociology, such as population density and social awareness about epidemics. All these factors may change with time. Changes in R0 may signal that the pathogen has become more transmissible, virulent or persistent in the population. They may also signal societal re-organization in response to the epidemic dynamic. Particularly important are changes in R, which, in addition to changes in R0, may also reflect changes in the susceptibility of the population. Monitoring changes in R may thus be instrumental in determining the success of public-health interventions such as mass vaccination [4, 7, 8].",

Surveillance and contact tracing provides a means of monitoring outbreaks by permanent registration of new cases. For example, monkeypox [12] and non-zoonotic measles [4] are potential candidates for eradication through vaccination. Monkeypox remains worrisome for the possibility that repeated introductions in the human population may yield novel strains of human poxes [13]. Following vaccine licensing in 1963, measles incidence in the United States decreased by more than 95% [14]. Nevertheless, recent R analysis [8] shows the potential for measles to re-emerge and emphasizes the importance of continued surveillance. In this work, we discuss monitoring R using outbreak-size surveillance data; only minor modifications are needed to apply our methodology to monitoring R0 of emerging infectious diseases.",

The quality of R estimation in our model depends on the number of outbreaks; see Fig 3c. Therefore the number of changes in R that can be estimated from a dataset depends on the number of outbreaks. We addressed the case of detecting a single change in R by solving a one-dimensional maximization problem for the Bayes factor B(Ta) (c.f., Eq 5). It is no coincidence that (global) maximization problems are divided between one- and multi-dimensional, the first class of problems being significantly easier. However, a number of numerical algorithms are readily available to address maximization in several dimensions [24]. In our case, such algorithms would have to face additional difficulties, inherent to the stochastic nature of the data modeling.",
