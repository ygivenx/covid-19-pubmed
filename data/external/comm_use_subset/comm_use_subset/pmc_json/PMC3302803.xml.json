During the 2003 SARS outbreak, our 2600-bed medical center experienced a serious nosocomial infection that resulted in closure of the facility in a bid to contain the hospital-acquired infection [1]. Since then, concerns have been raised about how the transmission of emerging infectious diseases from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs) and vice versa could be recognized and prevented in a timely manner [2], [3]. Thus, the hospital infection control team has been enhancing infection control training for HCWs and implementing hospital-wide surveillance during outbreaks of infection.",

Afebrile HCWs suspected of having H1N1 infection were also required to report to the infection control team within 24 hours. Throat (tonsillopharyngeal) swabs from sick HCWs were obtained for diagnosis of H1N1 influenza by a quantitative RT-PCR assay developed in our previous study [11]. After diagnosis was confirmed, a member of the infection control team conducted a face-to-face interview with the HCW to complete a semi-structured questionnaire to analyze possible routes of patient, household, or unspecified contact. The content of the questionnaire included the HCW's age, sex, symptoms/signs, onset of disease, coexisting condition(s), working location, and TOCC (travel, occupation, contact, cluster) history. HCWs confirmed with H1N1 infection received a 7-day off clinical duty period.

During the 6-month surveillance, 51 (1.0%) HCWs were confirmed to have H1N1 influenza infection. The attack rate among HCWs was 0.9% before the vaccination program was implemented, and was lower than that in another study (5.4%) [10]. It means that the infection control program in this study was observed to have a low attack rate of confirmed H1N1 cases. The low attack rate was attributable to an intensive infection control/monitoring/education program and universal vaccination policy. More importantly, we found that the number of infections acquired from patient care was much lower than that acquired from unspecified contact in the 2600-bed hospital cohort. This finding suggests that infection control is the most important strategy for control of H1N1 influenza transmission in a hospital before the availability of H1N1 influenza vaccination, and although HCWs may take every precaution to guard against acquiring influenza from patient care, they may still be infected from non-patient care sources.",

These guidelines were locally customized according to the guidelines defined by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [12], [13]. The low attack rate for hospital-acquired infection indicated that the infection control program was effective. Particularly, HCWs with H1N1 infection under medical surveillance were advised to be released from clinical duty and required to seek medical support for appropriate treatment. This strategy could minimize the risk of transmission among HCWs and patients in the hospital. Our study showed that an online HCW surveillance system is necessary for the detection of hospital transmission of pathogens, including novel H1N1 (2009) influenza virus. Implementation of hospital-wide surveillance, early detection, and early antiviral use will be important to limit the transmission of an emerging infectious disease such as H1N1 influenza among HCWs.",

Regarding work location, emergency rooms and pandemic (H1N1) isolation wards have been reported to be places with the highest risk [8], [10]. However, our study found that ordinary wards were the work locations with the highest risk. The reason that nurses were at a higher risk remains unclear; a possible explanation is that they were exposed more frequently to sick patients and the patients' relatives and visitors than were other HCWs during their course of work. The wards experienced the highest attack rate, probably because the HCWs in those wards had less stringent protection measures than other HCWs did.",
