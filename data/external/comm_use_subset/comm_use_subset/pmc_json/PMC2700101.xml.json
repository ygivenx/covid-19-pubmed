Its severe impacts to global human health, healthcare service, society, and economy were evidently documented during the previous pandemics [2,3]. For a coming one, influenza experts have agreed that this threat is inevitable and possibly imminent [4]. If the next pandemic occurs, it is expected that 20% of the global population will become ill, nearly 30 million will be hospitalized and a quarter of these would die within a few months of its attack [5]. To mitigate the impacts of this threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that all countries should consider this threat as very important and urged them to make preparations a high national priority.",

For a current threat of an influenza pandemic, sporadic perception surveys among health workers have been done in developed countries [9-12]. Yet this issue has not been explored in developing countries, particularly in the southeast Asian region where it is more likely to be a source of the next pandemic [13].",

However, the region faces a serious problem of ethnic violence. This unrest has led to the loss of over 2,600 lives and more than 7,000 injuries in the past 5 years. It is possible that the local health systems may have deteriorated due to the unrest leading to loosening of preparedness against the threat of an influenza pandemic. We have therefore conducted a study to investigate the preparedness. The current report is confined to perceptions related to the threat of an influenza pandemic with the objective to document the patterns of perception of health personnel toward this threat in southern Thailand. As health personnel are key persons for influenza pandemic preparedness and control, it is hoped that understanding their patterns of perception will allow control programs to properly improve the training. It may also be useful for other developing countries where an influenza pandemic is a serious threat, but the personnel are not fully prepared.",

While conventional factor analysis is used in scale development and tries to group items or variables, Q method tries to group subjects. Therefore, people of the same group or having the same factor will have a similar pattern of chosen statements. The implication would be that it would be easy to put people of the same factor into the same intervention program. This method was taken into our study because this is a scientific and systematic study of human subjectivity, involving perceptions, attitudes, and opinions [15,16]. Furthermore, it is also unique since it mixes the strong points of both qualitative and quantitative research techniques, compared to traditional surveys [17,18].",

This is generally collected from various sources (e.g., scientific papers, books, news, interviews, focus group discussions, etc.). It is commonly presented in the form of statements. Afterward, a Q sample (a representative set of statements) is selected from the concourse and developed to be more meaningful, which represents various issues of the study topic and eventually is compiled into the instrument. The study subjects are then asked to rank the representative statements and place them into a score sheet, which is designed in a continuous scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree, following a standardized instruction based on the judgment of each subject. This is known as the Q sorting procedure. The sheets that are completely ranked by each subject (Q-sort) are finally correlated and analyzed by Q (subject-wise) factor analysis, and the factors are then interpreted.",

To catch various aspects of an influenza pandemic and keeping the total number of the statements suitably manageable by our subjects, we included eight refined statements in each of such four domains with one additional item added to make the total number of the statements equal 33 (Q-sample). These statements were then placed into the score sheet (Figure 1), and forced to follow a quasi-normal distribution, that is, 2-3-4-5-5-5-4-3-2. The reliability of this instrument was tested with Cronbach's alpha. Each statement was randomly assigned a number from 1 to 33 for the subjects to arrange and place into the score sheet. To get more understandability, the statements were pilot-tested with 25 health personnel and were then revised as appropriate before the study.",

A participant who had absolute factor loadings of larger than \u00b1 0.45, which suggests high significance (p < 0.01) with the group, was included into that particular factor. In each factor, the ascending sorted normalized scores (Z-scores) of assigned number of each statement were returned into the score sheet from right to left order (Figures 2, 3, and 4). Each final score sheet thus displays the pattern of the defined factor. Comparisons among patterns were based on the factor scores and the mean values of the domain of the statements. For visualization of the patterns, the domains of each statement were linked to different colors or grey shadings in the final Q-sort models that are shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4. Since the cells in the extreme score regions reflect strong perceptions in the domains, they are the primary target for comparing similarity and dissimilarity of each group of health personnel's perceptions on the threat of an influenza pandemic.",

It has powerful influence on human's feeling, thinking, motivation, and behavior [20-22]. Previous meta-analyses provided evidence for self-efficacy having the largest effect size and was the strongest predictions of protection motivation [23,24]. People with low self-efficacy usually believe that tasks are harder than they can handle. This can lead to limit task planning, increase stress, reduce the low level of attempt, and having a tendency to avoid duties and activities [20-22]. Balicer et al. reported that nearly a half of local health workers may be unwilling to report to duty during a pandemic event [9]. However, that study did not identify different patterns of health workers as our study has done. Another conventional survey conducted among a general population (rather than health workers) in developed countries of Europe and Asia on avian influenza risk perception showed a similar result. The level of self-efficacy among the respondents was also low and the authors concluded that a low level of self efficacy may obstruct any interventions [25].",

Naturally, the occurrence and severity of an influenza pandemic cannot be predicted [26]. Fifteen per cent of our health personnel perceived the threat to have low severity and low vulnerability. In other words, this group of health personnel was optimistic that such a threat would not severely affect people's lives. A small survey by Curtis et al. on the perceptions toward such a threat among physicians showed that more than half did not consider that the risk of an imminent influenza pandemic was more than a possibility [10]. Both perceived severity and perceived vulnerability are components of threat appraisal of the PMT [19]. Perception of low level of severity and vulnerability or low levels of appraised threat of an influenza pandemic may inhibit motivation of health personnel to engage in protective behavior [27,28]. However, the effect sizes of such two components in previous meta-analyses were small to medium and barely predicted of protection motivation and behavior compared to the components of coping appraisal (response efficacy and self-efficacy) [23,24].",

Our study subjects might be different from those in other regions of the country where the infected cases of that avian influenza in both humans and poultry have been reported, and intensive avian influenza controls have been fully activated. The study subjects were also predominated by personnel from health centers and community hospitals in rural areas. The threat of a pandemic may be less compared to in urban areas. The study was based on Q methodology which had never been employed among local health workers; thus, the data have to be interpreted with caution. Approximately 30% of the respondents were not able to be classified into any of the three groups determined by our factor analysis. The patterns are therefore far from ideal.
