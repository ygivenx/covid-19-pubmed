In the four structures, the N-terminal HA tag and ~30 ectodomain residues were very disordered, indicating a large degree of flexibility in the membrane proximal polypeptide. The ectodomains have a hook-like conformation formed by domain I to IV and contained a zinc ion at the active site in domain II (Fig. 1). The exposed convex side of domain IV mediates similar protein dimerization in the distinct crystals. Approximately 950 \u00c52 of each monomer is buried at the dimer interface (Table 2), indicative of a stable protein-protein interaction. Domain IV is the largest APN domain and the most divergent in the M1 aminopeptidase family. In APN, domain IV has seven helix-turn-helix HEAT repeats and a single ARM repeat formed by three alpha helices (\u03b125-\u03b127). The ARM repeat is the most variable domain IV region in the hAPN and pAPN structures, and can contact the peptide substrate bound to the active site (see below).",

These structures identified three distinct APN conformations, based on active site accessibility, which we termed closed, intermediate and open forms (Fig. 1a).

Domain IV contacts with domain I or III changed markedly less (~100\u2013200 \u00c52 buried surface) than with domain II (1000 \u00c52); domain II-IV interaction thus mainly stabilized the closed APN conformation. There were no notable differences in the other interdomain contacts in the distinct APN forms (Table 2). Domains I-II are distant from domain IV in the open conformation of the APN monomer (Fig. 1a,b), where the zinc ion at the catalytic site is more accessible to the solvent (Fig. 1c). The domain I to III module swings 15\u00b0 toward domain IV, closing the active site (Fig. 1b,c). The hAPN structure adopts an intermediate conformation in the crystals (Fig. 1a); the distance between the N terminus of each monomer in the dimer is 116 \u00c5, and the angle difference of domain II with the closed conformation is ~6\u00b0 (Table 2).

On the cell surface, the domain I to III module must swing over domain IV, which is fixed by dimerization (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Video S1). The module movement must be facilitated by the flexible ~30-residue polypeptide that links domain I to the transmembrane domain (Supplementary Fig. S1a), although polypeptide length probably limits the interdomain movement shown here with APN (15\u00b0), which is less pronounced than that reported for ERAP-1 (22\u00b0, determined as in Table 2). The type of interdomain movement also differs between ERAP-1 and the APN. The domain III-IV module moves together relative to domain I-II in ERAP-1, whereas domain I to III swings over domain IV in the APN. In addition, the ERAP-1 hinge region is at the domain III N terminus, whereas that of APN is in the domain IV N terminus. Domains I, II and III can pivot at the beginning of the first (\u03b113) or third (\u03b115) domain IV helix, which are perpendicular to the swing angle (Fig. 1b). These differences in APN motion compared to other aminopeptidases are probably related to dimer formation, which is not observed in other M1 family members.",

In the closed pAPN, the side chain of a phenylalanine (Phe893) at domain IV was placed at about 4.5 \u00c5 from the hydrolyzable peptide bond, whose carbonyl group is coordinated to the zinc ion. The phenylalanine was located in the loop that connects \u03b126 and \u03b127 in the single domain IV ARM repeat of human and pig APN (Fig. 2a); it penetrated the active site groove in the closed conformation and locked the peptide, ready for hydrolysis. Domain IV residues that precede Phe893 in the \u03b126-\u03b127 loop contacted domain II in the closed pAPN. A similar loop conformation is seen in a closed hAPN structure (PDB code 4FYS)19.",

The phenylalanine adopted a distinct conformation in the intermediate and open APN conformations (Fig. 2a). Domain II movement was accompanied by a conformational change of the \u03b126-\u03b127 loop in domain IV (Supplementary Video S1), which became more solvent-exposed; the phenylalanine side chain faced into domain IV in the intermediate and open conformations and the peptide plug was removed from the active site.

Domain IV-based superposition of the open pAPN with bound RBD and that of closed pAPN showed a shift in the domain II main chain region that contacts the RBD; this region collides (<3.0 \u00c5) with the CoV tryptophan (Fig. 2b).

Staining for the RBD-Fc protein was similar in cells expressing the mutant, alone or with the drugs (Fig. 4a right and b right), which showed that compound binding to the pAPN active site was necessary to prevent RBD binding to a distant site. In addition, inhibition of RBD binding to pAPN was drug concentration-dependent (Fig. 4c), and the amount of compound needed to reach 50% inhibition (IC50) decreased with compound affinity for APN (~30 \u03bcM for bestatin (Ki ~4 \u03bcM), ~1 \u03bcM for actinonin (Ki ~1 \u03bcM), ~0.1 \u03bcM for ABS4 (Ki ~0.06 nM)).

Virus particles have high receptor-binding avidity, and these drugs might not have sufficient affinity to maintain most APN molecules closed. The selective compounds ABS1-4 have high affinity for APN and, at 1\u201310 \u03bcM concentrations, inhibit capillary tube formation in cell cultures, with no cytotoxicity27. In our cultures, we observed no toxicity at ABS concentrations <100 \u03bcM (not shown). We therefore analyzed the TGEV-mediated cytopathic effect for each of the four ABS molecules and actinonin at a 50 \u03bcM concentration and monitored inhibition of virus infection with ABS4 (2 log) and ABS2 (1 log) (Fig. 5a); at the same concentration, the lower-affinity ABS1 and ABS3 compounds or actinonin did not inhibit. ABS4 has a bromo substituent that is predicted to interact with the phenylalanine that plugs the substrate in the closed conformation32; this interaction likely helped maintain the closed ectodomain and efficiently prevented virus binding.",

The higher activity of the pAPN C2 than the C3 or C4 mutants suggested that the Cys464-Cys892 disulfide bond was more labile than the Cys464-Cys929 bond, probably because Cys892 is in a flexible loop (Supplementary Fig. S4). Treatment with a reducing agent restored catalysis and RBD binding in the cysteine mutants and did not affect wild type pAPN binding activity (Fig. 6). Reducing the disulfide bonds fully restored RBD binding, but catalysis was partially recovered in the pAPN C3 and C4 mutants. Substrate hydrolysis is proposed to close the ectodomain (see above), which would facilitate rebuilding the disulfides. Locking the closed form and the phenylalanine in the domain IV ARM repeat inside the active site probably impeded substrate processing (Fig. 2a). The pAPN cysteine mutants bound markedly less RBD than the wild type protein, which confirmed that CoV S protein binding to the closed pAPN was sterically hindered (Fig. 2b), and that CoV recognized the open form. Overall, these results validate the functional relevance of the APN ectodomain conformations and its motion.",

These differences could be due to the APN dimeric conformation and its linkage to the cell surface. Dimerization only engages the domain IV region, and we found that the dimer is conserved in all APN structures, closed, intermediate and open. APN domain IV thus does not move as described for ERAP-1 or F32324, proteins that do not form dimers. The fixed conformation of the APN dimer determines that the domain I to III module swings over domain IV (Supplementary Video S1), with the hinge at the domain IV N-terminal region. The length of this movement is less marked in APN (15\u00b0) than in ERAP-1 (22\u00b0), although the two proteins have very similar closed conformations. Displacement of the APN domains I, II and III must be limited by the length of the flexible polypeptide that links domain I to the transmembrane region, whose movement is restricted by membrane fluidity. The extent of APN movement nonetheless appears to be sufficient for release of the hydrolyzed peptide N-terminal residue, which is not plugged by domain IV in the open or in the intermediate APN conformations (Fig. 2a). It is not clear how each monomer in the dimer moves, whether their movement is random or synchronized in the same or inverse directions. Experiments with hAPN antibodies25 and those shown here with the TGEV RBD (Fig. 3) suggest that ~50% of the molecules adopt different forms; these data imply that each APN monomer maintains a distinct conformation (Supplementary Video S1).",

The switch between a proteolytic active (closed) and an inactive (open) conformation has been proposed for several M1 aminopeptidases20232428. This dynamics is thought to be important for peptide hydrolysis and release from the aminopeptidase active site. The region that joins \u03b126 and \u03b127 in the domain IV ARM repeat penetrates the active site groove in closed pig and human APN structures reported here and elsewhere (Fig. 2a)19, and a conserved phenylalanine in this region locks the substrate coordinated to the zinc ion, permitting hydrolysis. Further peptide processing likely requires removal of the phenylalanine lock by opening the APN ectodomain, which facilitates N-terminal residue release and peptide translocation, both sterically hindered in the closed conformation (Fig. 2a). The inherent flexibility in the domain IV ARM repeat that we demonstrate here is linked to interdomain arrangements might also enable substrate processing, and indicate how ectodomain movements participate in peptide hydrolysis. Local changes in a conserved tyrosine (Tyr472 in pAPN) at the active site of M1 aminopeptidases are also suggested to be important202428. Among APN forms, the absence of conformational switches in active site residues at domain II (Supplementary Fig. S2) nonetheless indicates that tyrosine movement is not linked to interdomain motion.",

Small molecules or conformation-specific antibody inhibitors of ectodomain motions can bind to the active site or interact with distant sites, as shown here with CoV spike fragments.
