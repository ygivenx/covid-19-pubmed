Antibiotics are rarely advocated in the management of bronchiolitis unless the illness is very severe or when a secondary bacterial infection is suspected [13]. However, semi-synthetic macrolides (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin) which have immuno-modulatory, and/or anti-microbial properties [14] and in-vitro anti-viral effects, [15] which may be beneficial in children with bronchiolitis and high nasopharyngeal carriage rates of bacteria. Three randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) have been published and these RCTs used different doses and duration of macrolides to treat hospitalised bronchiolitis [16]\n[17], [18]. These studies also differed in affluence of settings which may reflect differences in the frequency and severity of acute respiratory infections in these populations [19]. Thus not surprisingly, results from the existing RCTs differed in the effect on reducing length of hospitalisation and O2 requirement. A Turkish [17] trial reported improved clinical outcomes. In comparison a European [16] and a Brazilian [18] trials showed no improvement.",

The higher rate is more likely in less-affluent settings and/or with those with more severe disease [22]\u2013[24]. Viral-bacterial co-infections are more likely when the upper airways are densely colonised with bacteria or during repeated infections [25]. In the NT, children have early acquisition of bacteria in the nasal space [26]. This is more likely to be similar to Turkey where high rates of pneumonia and bronchiectasis are also reported [22]. Thus, we conducted a RCT on children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. Our primary objective was to determine whether a single large dose of azithromycin (compared to placebo) reduced length of stay (LOS) and duration of O2 requirement in children hospitalised with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. We also determined the influence of azithromycin on the incidence of respiratory readmissions and presence of bacteria and viruses in the nasopharynx.",

Our findings are similar to the other two trials [16], [18] showing that a single dose azithromycin does not shorten LOS and O2 requirement. However, methodological differences among trials need to be considered. One of the larger trials [16] included only children with RSV-confirmed bronchiolitis, thus limiting generalisation to bronchiolitis caused by other pathogens. Other differences included: age, ethnic populations, concurrent use of antibiotics, treatment practices and macrolide type, dose and duration. The immunomodulatory difference between azithromycin and clarithromycin may also account for the differential results between Tahan et al's study [17] with ours and the other 2 RCTs [16], [18]. For example, azithromycin increased the production of IL-10 whereas clarithromycin inhibited the production of IL-6 by dendritic cells in animal work [35]. Tahan and colleagues [17] used a daily dose for 3-weeks of clarithromycin, but ours like Kneyber et al [16], [18] (7-day daily dose) used a short course of azithromycin. However, Tahan et al's [17] study had very small numbers (n = 21) and high attrition. Thus, it remains unknown if a longer course of azithromycin may be effective in reducing readmission rates.",

However, unlike the Turkish RCT, [17] we did not find a beneficial effect of azithromycin on clinical outcomes. Possibly contributory reasons include the very high concomitant use of antibiotics in our group; different treatment regime used the density of bacterial carriage and secondary co-morbidities. The common use of antibiotics in children with bronchiolitis in our setting relates to the high rates of concomitant infections among children. A similar treatment practice occurs in Alaskan children [1]. 56% of Indigenous children in our trial received antibiotics before admission and 87% during hospitalisation. While the use of antibiotics is common practice in such settings, its effectiveness and possibly increased adverse events remains unknown. Ideally concurrent antibiotics should have been disallowed in our study but it was not possible to alter clinicians' practice and our a priori protocol allowed the concurrent use of antibiotics other than macrolides.",

As viruses were identified by PCR, it is not surprising no difference in viral detection were found at 48 hrs (although azithromycin may have some anti-viral effect) [15]. Future research should look at the impact of azithromycin on viral load/copies. While our numbers were small, we showed a significant difference in the mean number of respiratory bacteria per child; from 1.2 to 0.5 bacteria (difference 0.7 95%CI 0.25, 1.1, p = 0.01) in the azithromycin group.

The most likely reason why the latter aspects are different from our previous study [5] is because we excluded children managed in intensive care. In our cohort, Indigenous children were more likely to be readmitted for another respiratory illness. This is not surprising as Indigenous children in the NT are 5 times more likely to be hospitalised for pneumonia and influenza than non-Indigenous children [43]. Whether readmission is related to the insult from bronchiolitis can only be postulated. Recurrent hospitalisation for respiratory illness is an independent risk factor for developing bronchiectasis and/or respiratory dysfunction in adulthood [44], [45]. In our region, bronchiectasis affects 1 in every 68 Indigenous children [46]. In the follow up of our cohort, 6/61 (10%) Indigenous children (3 in azithromycin group, 3 in placebo group) have subsequently been diagnosed with bronchiectasis and an additional 4 children are awaiting chest scans.",
