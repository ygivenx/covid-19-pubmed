It was assumed that the virus can easily be detected in the upper respiratory tract at the stage of early infection. When the disease progressed, the virus was more likely to appear in the lower respiratory tract and other locations such as intestines and blood [9]. Thus, the virus may not be detected in throat swabs, especially for cases without expectoration. This may explain why some patients had negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at initial presentation despite positive findings in chest CT, or positive RT-PCT and negative CT findings at initial presentation [10,11].
