Together with toroviruses, arteriviruses and roniviruses, coronaviruses are members of the order Nidovirales (Siddell et al., 2005).",

Most infections are asymptomatic or result in mild, self-limiting gastrointestinal disease, and in these cases the causative agent is known as feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). In a small percentage (<5 %) of animals, however, a fatal multi-systemic, immune-mediated disease occurs and this is known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Pedersen, 1995).

Type I viruses are most prevalent in the field and account for approximately 80 % of all infections (Addie et al., 2003; Hohdatsu et al., 1992). Type II viruses are less prevalent and are characterized by recombination events that result in the replacement of the FCoV spike (S) glycoprotein gene with the equivalent gene of canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) (Herrewegh et al., 1998). There is no evidence that either type is more commonly associated with FIP in natural infections (Benetka et al., 2004). The majority of research on FCoV to date has concentrated on the investigation of type II strains, most notably FIPV 79-1146, because they replicate well in cell culture.",

            "text": "The species specificity of coronaviruses is, to a large extent, determined by the recognition of a functional receptor on the surface of the host cell (Kuo et al., 2000). Coronaviruses use a variety of cellular receptors (Masters, 2006) and, even within a single host species, different receptors are used by different coronaviruses (Li et al., 2003; Yeager et al., 1992). It is accepted that type II FCoV strains use feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as a receptor for host attachment and entry (Tresnan et al., 1996). Consequently, they can be readily propagated in cell lines such as Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells, which express fAPN on their surface (Miguel et al., 2002). In contrast, there is conflicting evidence regarding the receptor for the attachment and entry of type I FCoV. Tresnan et al. (1996) have reported that the UCD-1 strain of FIPV, which is a type I virus, also uses fAPN as a receptor, albeit inefficiently. Their conclusion was based upon the ability of the UCD-1 strain to infect and express viral antigens in both hamster and mouse cells (which, normally, cannot be infected) that had been stably transfected with fAPN cDNA. In contrast, Hohdatsu et al. (1998) have concluded that fAPN is not a receptor for type I FCoV. Their conclusion is based upon the ability of an fAPN-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), R-G-4, to block the infection of Felis catus whole foetus (Fcwf-4) cells with type II viruses, whereas the same antibody was not able to block infection with type I viruses.",

            "text": "The aim of the studies reported here was to provide evidence for or against the involvement of fAPN as a receptor for type I FCoV. Our approach was to produce retroviral pseudotypes that bear type I or type II FCoV S glycoprotein and produce a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene signal in transduced cells. We chose this approach because human coronavirus S glycoproteins have been successfully pseudotyped onto similar retroviral vectors and then used to analyse the recognition of cellular receptors (Hofmann et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2004; Temperton et al., 2005). In our case, the pseudotypes were used to screen a range of feline cell lines for the expression of a functional receptor for attachment and entry. Our results clearly show that type I FCoV S glycoprotein fails to recognize fAPN as a functional receptor on three continuous feline cell lines. This suggests fAPN is not the receptor for type I FCoV. Our results also demonstrate that these retroviral pseudotypes can be used to screen for cells that are permissive for attachment and entry with FCoV, and we conclude that they can be used to identify and characterize the cellular receptor for type I FCoV. This would allow for the development of cell lines that efficiently replicate and propagate type I FCoV, which, in turn, would facilitate the investigation of these more clinically relevant viruses and aid in the development of a type I FCoV reverse genetics system.",

The type II and type I FCoV S genes were amplified respectively in one-step RT-PCR reactions. Primer sets T003/T004 and T013/T014 were used to produce truncated cDNA versions of the type II (4347 bp) and type I (4392 bp) S genes. The truncated versions of the S glycoprotein genes terminated 11 codons upstream of the authentic S gene stop codon and eliminated a dibasic retention signal (KXHXX, KVHV/IH), which is proposed to contribute to the localization of FCoV S glycoprotein to the site of virus assembly at the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (Lontok et al., 2004). Primer sets T009/T010 and T013/T015 were used to produce full-length versions of the type II (4383 bp) and type I (4428 bp) S genes. Each of the four S gene PCR cDNA fragments was then cloned into the Blunt II-TOPO vector and colonies containing the correct plasmid inserts were identified by restriction enzyme analysis. Sequencing the S gene cDNA inserts was done using FCoV type II and type I S gene-specific primers and the Blunt II-TOPO vector-specific primers M13-F and M13-R. This revealed the presence of mutations in each construct. Before proceeding, these mutations were repaired by the exchange of restriction fragments from cDNA clones with authentic S glycoprotein gene sequences. Because of the position of the mutations and a lack of convenient restriction sites in the type I S gene constructs, silent mutations at positions 474 (A\u2192G) and 1827 (T\u2192C) were not repaired. Plasmid DNA from the four Blunt II-TOPO S gene constructs was digested using KpnI and XhoI and the S gene fragments were ligated into the multiple cloning site of pCAGGS vector DNA. The correct plasmid inserts were identified by restriction enzyme analysis, and nucleotide sequencing confirmed that all four inserts had the expected S gene nucleotide sequence. The vector\u2013cDNA junctions were also verified by sequencing with vector-specific primers, pCAGG-F and pCAGG-R (see Supplementary Table S1, available in JGV Online). The constructs were designated pCAGGS/FCoVII-Str (type II, truncated), pCAGGS/FCoVII-S (type II, full-length), pCAGGS/FCoVI-Str (type I, truncated) and pCAGGS/FCoVI-S (type I, full-length).",

For surface proteins to be effectively incorporated into the viral pseudotype, it is therefore preferable that they are expressed at the host cell membrane. HEK 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS/FCoVII-Str, pCAGGS/FCoVII-S, pCAGGS/FCoVI-Str and pCAGGS/FCoVI-S plasmid DNA, and FACS analysis was used to quantify surface expression of the FCoV S glycoproteins 48 h post-transfection. The results show that the highest levels of S glycoprotein surface expression were obtained in the cells transfected with the truncated S gene constructs. Approximately, 41 % of cells transfected with the truncated type II S gene plasmid (pCAGGS/FCoVII-Str) were fluorescence positive, in contrast to only 2 % of cells transfected with the full-length type II S gene plasmid (pCAGGS/FCoVII-S).

These results demonstrate that truncated forms of the FCoV S glycoprotein should be used to produce high titre viral pseudotypes and they support the idea that the dibasic motif identified at the carboxyl terminus of the FCoV S glycoprotein (Lontok et al., 2004) is indeed an intracellular retention signal.",

However, as the levels of S glycoprotein expression in HEK 239T cells transfected with both type I and type II truncated S glycoprotein constructs were not the same (Fig. 1), it is possible that, compared with the FCoV type II pseudotypes, the FCoV type I pseudotypes had failed to incorporate a sufficient density of membrane-bound S glycoprotein. To address this, two further experiments were done. First, an ELISA assay was done to detect the presence of the FCoV type I S glycoprotein in the FCoV type I pseudotype particles. ELISA plates were coated with the MLV(FCoVI-Str) pseudotype supernatant diluted in coating buffer and the 210-70-FIP1 antiserum was used as the primary antibody. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The two control samples (coating buffer only and coating with medium) were negative over the range of dilutions tested. In contrast, at two different antigen concentrations, the FCoV type I pseudotype supernatant showed a positive signal relative to the primary antibody concentration.

This conclusion is consistent with the difficulties encountered in the isolation and propagation of type I FCoV in feline cell culture and is in agreement with the conclusions of Hohdatsu et al. (1992). However, it is not consistent with the report by Tresnan et al. (1996) that the UCD-1 strain of FIPV, a type I virus, is able to infect and express viral antigens in hamster and mouse cells that had been stably transfected with fAPN cDNA. It is, perhaps, relevant to note that in the experiments reported by Tresnan et al. (1996), the infection of fAPN-transfected hamster cells was much lower with type I viruses, compared with type II viruses (2 and 30 % of cells in tranfected cultures, respectively). At the moment, we can only suggest that the expression of fAPN in mouse or hamster cells, or the selection of cells in G418 is able to augment the infection of a small percentage of cells by a fAPN-independent route.",

It is noteworthy, however, that in these studies, the type I viruses used showed only a low level of cell-associated infection and that attachment or adsorption of virus to these cells could be significantly enhanced by low-speed centrifugation or the inclusion of polymeric cations, such as DEAE-dextran in the culture medium during the absorption period (Hohdatsu et al., 1995). Our interpretation is that the FCoV type I S glycoprotein\u2013receptor interaction at the surface of Fcwf-4 cells is of low affinity and is not sufficient to mediate a level of pseudotype transduction that is detectable in our system. Also, it is possible that in the absence of a high affinity receptor-mediated entry mechanism, the phagocytic activity of the macrophage-like Fcfw-4 cell line rapidly depletes the culture supernatant of retroviral pseudotypes.",

            "text": "The results of this study also suggest that the viral pseudotypes reported here may be useful for the identification of the cellular receptor for type I FCoV and the development of cell lines that would efficiently replicate and propagate type I FCoV. In the first instance, the viral pseudotypes could be used to screen for continuous feline cell lines that are permissive for attachment and entry. However, type I FCoV appears to have an extremely narrow host range and cell tropism, and we consider it probable that even if such a cell line was found, it would be unlikely to be useful for non-cell-associated virus replication. The most promising candidate would probably be feline gut epithelial cell line because FCoV is primarily an enteric virus that binds to the apical surface of gut epithelial cells in the feline gastrointestinal tract (Rossen et al., 2001). Unfortunately, there are no feline gut cell lines available commercially. An alternative strategy would be to identify the FCoV type I virus receptor and to produce a permissive cell line that expresses this receptor at its cell surface. Again, the viral pseudotypes could be used to identify cells, for example in gut explant or peripheral blood monocyte cell cultures, that express the type I FCoV receptor and then to use these cells as a source of receptor protein-enriched membranes or receptor mRNA-enriched RNA. From this point onwards, the identification of the FCoV receptor, the production of a FCoV receptor cDNA and the generation of a stably transfected, receptor-expressing feline cell line could follow strategies that have proven successful for other viruses (Assavalapsakul et al., 2006; Tatsuo et al., 2000). Such a cell line would be a valuable tool for future FCoV studies.",
