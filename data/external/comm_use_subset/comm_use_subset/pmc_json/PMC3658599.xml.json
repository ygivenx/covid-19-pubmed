Infectious bronchitis virus is not only an important pathogen of the respiratory system, but also can be nephropathogenic and cause infection of the reproductive system [2\u20134]. IBV was first recognised as avian respiratory pathogen in 1930, after that many IBV vaccines were introduced to tackle this problem (H52, H120, M41, 4/91(793/B), and other strains). Recently, different IBV variants have emerged causing nephropathogenic and reproductive problems which require a dramatic change in vaccination programmes [5, 6].",

This strain was first implicated in proventriculitis in chickens [8], but in recent studies, this strain has been isolated from the trachea of infected chickens [9]. IBV CK/CH/LDL/97I strain accounts for 3.2% of total IBV strains found in China in the last 15 years [9]. The spike glycoprotein gene is the most variable gene in the IBV genome [10] and is composed of S1 and S2 subunits. Spike subunit 1 (S1) is about 1644 nt in length. The S1 protein is highly variable; it can differ from 20% to 25% and even up to 50% in the amino acid sequence among IBV serotypes [11]. This variability makes the S1 gene an ideal target in molecular assays to type IBV strains by RT-PCR and sequencing. The level of homology of the S1 subunit or part of it can predict cross-protection, that is, the higher the homology, the higher the chance of cross-protection [12, 13], but this rule is not always fulfilled [3]. Heterologous protection against the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain has not been achieved, since the nucleotide and amino acid homology of the CK/CH/LDL/97I S1 gene is only around 79% compared to the IBV vaccine strains. Only homologous protection has been achieved against CK/CH/LDL/97I [7].",

The Jordanian IBV isolate (JOA2) had a nucleotide identity of 98.1% and 99.4% to the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains, respectively. For the isolate JOA4, it had 98.8% and 99.7% nucleotide identity to the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains, respectively. The Saudi IBV isolates had a unique feature, in which isolated Saudi-1 shared 99.1% and 100% nucleotide identity to the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains, respectively, while the Saudi-2 had only 96.6% and 97.5% nucleotide identity to the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains, respectively. This could be due to an earlier introduction of this isolate to Saudi Arabia. The Iraqi IBV isolate shared 98.8% and 99.7% nucleotide identity to the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains, respectively.",

This strain was isolated from the tracheas of infected chickens [9]. The IBV CK/CH/LDL/97I strains showed slight variability in the partial S1 sequence among IBV isolates from these three countries. The mode transmission of this strain from China to the Middle East is not clear; one reason might be that Chinese poultry vaccines and products have recently been registered and used in the Middle East.",
