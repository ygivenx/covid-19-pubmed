For that reason, they are widely utilized as conductors for flexible electronics [8], catalysts for polymerization of alkylosilanes [9], detectors for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [10], contrast agents in X-ray imaging [11], vehicles for drug delivery [12], agents in photo-induced hyperthermia [13], and in microwave-induced hyperthermia treatment of cancer [14].",

            "text": "Microwave-induced hyperthermia treatment of cancer has gained a lot of interest in the past several years. This treatment is recognized as efficient and non-invasive [15], being successfully applied for the treatment of metastatic tissues in bones [16], breast [17,18,19], prostate [20], bladder [14], brain [15], and liver [21]. Since hyperthermia-based medical procedures rely on the susceptibility of metastatic tissues to be destroyed at elevated temperatures (41\u201347 \u00b0C) [22], the increase in the thermal response of the area surrounding a tumour may lead to more effective treatment. In microwave-induced hyperthermia procedures, this is achieved by applying nanofluids (NFs) that usually contain metallic nanostructures with ability to be electromagnetically excited. The most common NFs are Fe3O4-based and are effective in the hyperthermia treatment of bone metastases [16]. AuNPs are usually applied in sophisticated procedures of photo-induced hyperthermia due to the plasmonic effect that they cause [13]. However, based on our previous studies [23,24], AuNPs and PtNPs have the extraordinary ability to transfer and accumulate heat, even at ultra-trace concentrations. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the application of functionalized AuNPs in microwave-induced hyperthermia treatment of cancer may also be very effective.",

Although many methods were described for the production of AuNPs, green methods are a promising alternative to well-known chemical methods [25]. In green synthesis, naturally occurring substances are used as reducing and stabilizing agents during AuNPs production instead of strong, and usually toxic, chemicals. For that reason, synthesized AuNPs are biogenic and biocompatible [26,27,28]. There are a variety of natural products reported to be suitable for green synthesis of AuNPs. Accordingly, aqueous leaf extracts prepared from Mentha piperita [28], Melissa officinalis [28], Salvia officinalis [28], Terminalia catappa [29], Rosa rugosa [30], Hibiscus rosa sinensis [31], Cinnamomum camphora [32], Eucalyptus globulus [33], Rosmarinus officinalis [33], Ziziphus zizyphus [34], and Plumbago zeylanica [35], aqueous extracts originated from blackberries, blueberries, and pomegranates [36], in addition to essential oils collected from Eucalyptus globulus [33], Rosmarinus officinalis [33], Anacardium occidentale [37], Curcuma pseudomontana [38], and some food products, including Punica granatum juices [39], coffee Arabica infusions [40], and cacao powder beverages [41] were involved in the production of AuNPs. To the best of our knowledge, only a few research groups have attempted to produce honey-based NFs containing Au nanostructures [42,43,44].",

A large variety of plant species from which bees might collect nectar, pollen, or honeydew, as well as apiary location, and environmental conditions means that several types of honeys can be distinguished [46]. Among them, the most popular are flower, e.g., multi-flower, rapeseed, buckwheat, lime, or heather, and honeydew honeys made from coniferous, leaf, and fir honeydew [47]. The botanical provenience of the nectar, pollen, and honeydew, as well as environmental pollution, influence the chemical composition of honey [48], which can contain more than 400 different compounds [48]. In addition to water, which content in honey is less than 20% (w/v) [45], there are many others substances, namely sugars (e.g., glucose, D-fructose, maltose) [49], aliphatic acids (e.g., formic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid) [50], phenolics (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol, luteoil, rutin) [51], terpenes (e.g., monoterpenes) [52], ketones (e.g., acetoin) [53], vitamins (e.g., ascorbic acid, niacin, pyridoxine) [45], and proteins (e.g., alanine, arginine, serine, proline, phenylalanine) [45].",

By tuning the type of applied aqueous honey solutions, the honey concentration in these solutions, as well as the concentration of Au(III) ions added to these aqueous solutions, optimal conditions, at which the smallest in size AuNPs were produced, were found by applying UV/Vis absorption spectrophotometry (UV/Vis). Then, nanofluids (NFs) containing AuNPs synthesized under these optimal conditions were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) supported by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Next, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR) was applied to identify chemical compounds of honey solutions responsible for the production of AuNPs. Particularly, to reveal the role of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds in examined green synthesis of Au nanostructures, total concentrations of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds in applied honey solutions were determined using the Bertrand\u2019s method and the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, respectively. Furthermore, AuNPs of defined optical and granulometric properties were tested in a microwave radiation field, simulating procedures of hyperthermia treatment of cancer.",

For that reason, the first indication that AuNPs were fruitfully synthesized with the aid of honey solutions was the change of colour of the mixed solutions from yellowish (before addition of a solution of Au(III) ions to a given honey solution) to ruby-red (after addition of the solution of Au(III) ions). Appearance of such a ruby-red colour in the mixed solution containing Au(III) ions at 100 mg\u00b7L\u22121 and 20% (w/v) of honeydew honey was observed after 5 min. On the other hand, for a lime tree honey and multi-flower honey, the mentioned ruby-red colour appeared after 30 and 35 min, respectively, for the mixed solution consisting 100 mg\u00b7L\u22121 of Au(III) ions and 20% (w/v) of honeys. In addition, it was noted that the formation of AuNPs, emanated by the appearance of the ruby-red colour of mixed solutions, strongly depended on the type of honey used for synthesis, as well as the concentration of honey, and the concentration of Au(III) ions in resultant mixed solutions. Accordingly, differences observed in time after which the ruby-red colour appeared in mixed solutions were directly related to differences in the concentration of chemical compounds, namely reducing sugars and polyphenols, that were responsible for the reduction of Au(III) ions and the stabilization of AuNPs formed in these conditions [43].",

Hence, on the basis of values on the LSPR absorption band \u03bbmax, it was possible to select optimal conditions for the production of the smallest in size AuNPs (Figure 2). Accordingly, the lowest value of the LSPR absorption band \u03bbmax was 538.5 nm and was observed for conditions when the lime tree honey solution was used and its final concentration in the mixed solution was 20% (w/v) while the concentration of Au(III) ions was 25 mg\u00b7L\u22121. When using multi-flower solutions, similar conditions in reference to concentrations of honey and Au(III) ions were also found to produce the smallest in size AgNPs with the LSPR absorption band \u03bbmax located at 538.2 nm. By contrast, optimal conditions for the synthesis of AuNPs with honeydew honey solutions related to the concentration of honey and Au(III) in the mixed solution was 5% (w/v) and 50 mg\u00b7L\u22121, respectively. For all honey solutions used, it was established that when the concentration of Au(III) ions in the mixed solution increased, the position of the LSPR absorption band \u03bbmax also increased, indicating that the AuNPs higher in size were formed in these conditions (see results in Table 1). Therefore, for all subsequent experiments, AgNPs were synthesized mixing solutions of honeys and Au(III) ions so as their final concentrations in mixed solutions were 20% (w/v) and 25 mg\u00b7L\u22121, respectively. Although these latter conditions were not optimal for honeydew honey, they were applied for consistency with conditions established for two other honeys (lime tree, multi-flower).",

            "text": "Several studies demonstrate that reducing sugars and phenolic compounds play a significant role in green synthesis of AuNPs [28,33,55]. Their contribution to the formation of AuNPs is likely associated with their reducing and stabilizing properties [55]. For that reason, the concentration of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds in honey solutions used for green synthesis of AuNPs, before and after the addition of a solution of Au(III) ions into them, have been examined. It was found that the concentration of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds in honey solutions changed after the addition of Au(III) ions (Table 2). This suggested that these compounds were involved in the production of Au nanostructures. In addition, a relationship between the concentration of reducing sugars in honey solutions and the average size of produced AuNPs was found (Table 2, Figure 6). Honey solutions with high total concentrations of reducing sugars seemingly led to formation of smaller in size AuNPs. As was suggested by Snitka et al. [43], honey-mediated formation of AuNPs was related to the total concentration of reducing sugars, as well as to the type of reducing sugars. Apparently from the cited work, glucose (aldose) was found to be the main reducing agent in green synthesis of AuNPs, and this was associated with the presence of the aldehyde group [43]. On the other hand, D-fructose (ketose) exhibited only stabilizing properties during synthesis of AuNPs [43]. Stabilizing properties of D-fructose were related to repulsive forces (electrostatic or steric) due to its hydrophobic carbon chain. Overall, Snitka et al. suggested that glucose was a primary compound involved in honey-mediated reduction of Au(III) to Au0 of nanometric size, whereas D-fructose behaved as a capping agent for AuNPs nucleation and their growth, and prevented their aggregation [43]. However, no correlation between the total content of phenolics and size of resultant AuNPs was found (Table 2). Thus, it was concluded that reducing sugars were crucial for determining the size of resultant AuNPs.",

As can be seen, AuNPs synthesized using multiflower honey were heated to 45 \u00b0C in about 5 min. Meanwhile, the AuNPs fabricated in the solution of honeydew honey reached maximum of 44 \u00b0C in about 6 min. The differences are attributed to the slightly greater average size of the latter ones, leading to the conclusion, that greater area-to-surface ratio ensures more effective heating. In the same time, exposure to microwaves (at 15 W) led water to be heated up to 30 \u00b0C, however, the system needed almost 7 min to achieve this. As a result, the greatest heating rate to maximum temperature was recorded for the medium with AuNPs obtained with the aid of multiflower honey (11.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121) as compared to this for water (6.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121). Since the tested NFs with AuNPs was heated to temperatures 14\u201315 \u00b0C greater than the temperature of water, it could be stated that AuNPs indeed might be applicable in hyperthermia treatment procedures. To maintain constant temperature of the NF containing AuNPs required the microwave field to be periodically turned off and turned on. No such operation was required for water, which was constantly exposed to microwave radiation. It must be remembered that in real life conditions, both AuNPs and water in tissues would be heated at the same time by exactly the same exposure to microwaves, whether it would be turned off or turned on. Hence, maintaining constant hyperthermia of AuNPs would inevitably lead to cyclic turning off microwave radiation. This in turn would result in a decrease of temperature of surrounding tissues. Therefore, based on the observed phenomena, and due to the fact that Au nanostructures produced with the aid of honey solutions were likely functionalized by monosaccharaides such as glucose and D-fructose, it could be stated that such green synthesized AuNPs would be suitable for microwave hyperthermia treatment of cancer.",

By selecting the type of honey, and the concentration of honey and Au(III) ions in mixed solutions, appropriate experimental conditions mediating green synthesis of the smallest in size Au nanostructures were found. Based on UV/Vis and TEM measurements, the smallest in size AuNPs were efficiently produced when the concentration of honeydew honey and Au(III) ions in the mixed solution was 20% (w/v) and 25 mg\u00b7L\u22121, respectively. Resultant Au nanostructures were mostly spherical in shape (~80%) and exhibited the average size of 20.6 \u00b1 23.3 nm, as assessed by TEM. Elemental composition of so-prepared AuNPs was determined by EDX, while their crystalline structure was established using XRD. It was confirmed that AuNPs were formed with the face-centered cubic crystalline structure. In addition, it was established that NFs containing AuNPs produced by this simple and fast green synthesis method developed here might be useful in microwave-induced hyperthermia treatment of cancer. To reveal the role of chemical compounds present in honey solutions used for synthesis, qualitative and quantitative analyses of chemical compounds likely involved in AuNPs production were carried out. Based on ATR FT-IR measurements, it was suggested that carboxylic acids, free amino-acids, monosaccharaides (glucose, D-fructose), and proteins might be involved in capping and functionalization of produced nanostructures. In addition, it was noted that reducing sugars as well as polyphenolic compounds played a crucial role in AuNPs formation.",
