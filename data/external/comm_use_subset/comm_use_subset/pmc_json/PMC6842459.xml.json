The viral genome is about 27 kb long and encodes non-structural (such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and other accessory and regulatory proteins) and structural proteins (i.e., the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) [3]. Among the others, the spike protein (S), and the sub-unit S1 in particular, is widely studied because of its role in cell tropism, receptor attachment, neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune response induction [1, 4, 5]. Additionally, the high genetic variability of the S1 gene has prompted its use for the classification of IBV strains into genotypes and lineages, which can display significantly different geographical distribution and, in some instances, biological behavior and immunological features [6].",

This heterogeneity poses noteworthy challenges to the understanding of IBV epidemiology and its control. Currently, vaccination represents the most applied and effective strategy to limit the disease impact. Nevertheless, the antigenic variability entails the existence of several serotypes and protectotypes, which translate in a poor cross-protection among genotypes [9], requiring the use of different vaccine combinations in order to broaden the protection spectrum or the development of new vaccines against recently emerged or introduced genotypes [10, 11]. Unfortunately, even closely related vaccines can fall into episodes of incomplete protection or vaccine immune-escape because of amino acid substitution in specific antigenic sites [9].",

When immunity is not sterilizing, wild strains are able to circulate in a new and more challenging environment, potentially adapting to it [13, 14]. Numerous examples can be mentioned for viruses that, to different degrees, circumvented vaccination strategies by immuno-escape (Hepatitis B virus, avian Metapneumovirus, Porcine circovirus type 2) [15\u201317], virulence increase (Marek disease virus) [18], or both (Infectious bursal disease virus) [18].",

Particularly, the spike protein has been recognized as the most relevant target of the host immune response [4, 20]. Therefore, a S1-focused study design, limiting the technical problems and maximizing the biological information can be defined.GI-19 is one of the most relevant lineages in the world, and the most significant one in Italy. Our previous studies have provided a detailed characterization of its molecular epidemiology in Italy and integrated this information with the remarkable, and ever increasing, number of sequences released worldwide [19, 21, 22]. This bulk of data allowed to demonstrate that after the introduction in Italy, QX strains had a substantially independent evolution [19].The Italian poultry industry is dominated by few integrated companies, mainly located in northern Italy. Consequently, the applied control strategies are highly homogeneous among farms. Particularly, a homologous QX vaccine has recently been introduced by some of these companies and applied to all affiliated broiler farms, replacing a Mass + 793B based vaccination. Therefore, a clear comparison between the pre- and post-homologous vaccination application was possible.\n",

The present work confirms this trend also for IBV, since an overall higher selective pressure strength was proven after homologous vaccination was introduced. Of note, differently from experimental infections, the molecular epidemiology-based statistical approach applied in the present study allows modelling viral evolution in its natural environment. The bias and confounding effects due to experimental conditions, animal genetic line and health status, infectious dose, selected viral strain etc. are thus avoided. Moreover, the random inclusion of several farms located in the same area before and after homologous vaccination introduction controls for the individual flock peculiarities and contingent situations, provide an overall picture of the investigated phenomenon. Several sites were detected to be under a significant episodic diversifying or directional selection in the post vaccination period only. Significantly, all the corresponding amino acids were exposed on the viral S1 surface (Figure 2), thus allowing the speculation of the role of host derived immune selection in affecting evolution.",

Based on this evidence and considering that episodic diversifying selection could be detected only in the post-vaccination dataset, an evolution occurring through a selective burst induced by homologous vaccination introduction can thus be hypothesized. Nevertheless, a lower statistical power of methods dealing only with pervasive selection could be expected [35]. When the difference between post- and pre-vaccination period in dN-dS was calculated, an overall balance in favor of a higher diversifying selection was evidenced after the homologous vaccination introduction. Therefore, although not statistically significant, a trend featured by a higher selective pressure was confirmed also by these methods (Figures 1 and 3). The highest cumulative score in dN-dS difference between vaccination periods was located in the S1 C-terminal domain (CTD), where the two extended putative receptor-binding motif (RBM) loops are located (Figure 2) [36]. This finding is particularly suggestive since antibodies raised against the RBM domain could display a higher neutralizing activity and, therefore, exert a stronger pressure toward viral diversification. Accordingly, the corresponding region (including the aa 394, detected under directional selection in the present study) was demonstrated to be involved in the selection of neutralization-resistant D274 genotype variants [40].",

The scenario is further worsened by the typically partial coverage achieved by routine vaccination protocols in field conditions that, although usually effective in preventing clinical outbreaks and reducing the infectious pressure, facilitates the circulation of field viruses in a partially immunized population [21, 43]. A previous study based on a phylodynamic approach, performed in the same geographic area and timeframe, demonstrated the benefits of the homologous vaccination introduction in reducing viral population size and outbreak frequency [21]. Nevertheless, the IBV QX genotype has continued to circulate in Italy. These weaknesses can allow the presence of a viral population size high enough for natural selection to act and favor the emergence of more fit variants in a new immune-environment. Due to the early vaccination and short life span of the animals, the vaccine-induced immunity is expected to be the dominant force interacting and shaping viral evolution, rather than natural infection. Additionally, the immunity induced by a single strain (i.e. vaccine virus) is likely to be more homogeneous compared to the one elicited against heterogeneous field strains. Although the treatment-mosaic-like situation is considered one of the key factors limiting the emergence of vaccine-escape mutants, the reduced genetic variability of the poultry population imposed by commercial constraints could imply a decreased immune response spectrum, facilitating the selection of specific mutations.",
