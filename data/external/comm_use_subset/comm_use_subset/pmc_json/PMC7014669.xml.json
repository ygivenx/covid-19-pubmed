This decision by WHO Director-General (DG) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was made following the recommendations of the Emergency Committee in its second meeting [1] convened under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) [2]. In his decision, the WHO DG stressed \u2018the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it\u2019 as one major concern and the importance of \u2018preventing the spread of the virus and ensuring a measured and evidence-based response\u2019 [3].\n",
