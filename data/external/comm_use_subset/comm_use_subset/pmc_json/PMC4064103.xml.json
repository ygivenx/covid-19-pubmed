Alternative approaches, which can be used to predict secondary structure of a single sequence, are based on thermodynamic parameters derived in part from experimental data [23]. While thermodynamics-based approaches can be less accurate than comparative-based algorithms, thermodynamics-based approaches are applicable in cases of novel RNAs such as the many RNAs of unknown function recently reported by the ENCODE consortium [24]. Thermodynamics-based approaches can also be easier to apply to prediction of the structure of interacting RNA molecules, for example, in gene knockdown studies.",

These methods trade off run-time complexity and the generality of the class of structures they can predict. For example, the most general algorithm of Rivas and Eddy [33], whose running time is \u0398(n6) on inputs of length n, is not practical for RNA sequences of length more than 100 nucleotides. This has been the main reason for development of heuristic methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures [36-41]. Although heuristic methods may not find the MFE structure, they usually run faster than the MFE-based methods that handle the same class of structures. For example, HotKnots V2.0 [36,41] is a heuristic approach that uses carefully trained energy parameters, is guided by energy minimization and can handle kissing hairpin structures. However, HotKnots is still slow on long sequences.",

Roughly, the larger the SHAPE reactivity value for a given nucleotide, the more likely it is that the nucleotide is unpaired in the structure. However, limited SHAPE reactivity data is available, and the data does not unambiguously determine whether a base is paired or not or, if it is paired, to what other nucleotide. Deigan et al. [46] created pseudo energy terms from SHAPE reactivity data, as a means of integrating such data into prediction software. They reported prediction accuracy of 96% to 100% for three moderate-sized RNAs (<200 nucleotides) and for 16S rRNA (1500 nucleotides). ShapeKnots [47] is a new method for incorporating SHAPE reactivity data for pseudoknotted structures that incorporates the pseudo energy terms into a heuristic method similar to that of Ren et al.

This hypothesis posits that an RNA molecule first folds into a pseudoknot-free structure; then additional base pairs are added that may form pseudoknots with the first structure so as to lower the structure\u2019s free energy [49]. Given a pseudoknot-free structure as input, HFold predicts a possibly pseudoknotted structure from a broad class that contains the given input structure and, relative to that constraint, has minimum free energy. HFold\u2019s running time is O(n3), significantly faster than other methods for predicting pseudoknotted structures. Several experts have provided evidence for, and support, the hierarchical folding hypothesis [49-52]. The class of structures that HFold can handle, density-2 structures, is quite general and includes many important pseudoknots including H-type pseudoknots, kissing hairpins and infinite chains of interleaved bands, with arbitrary nested (pseudoknotted) substructures. (Roughly, a structure is density-2 if no base is enclosed by more than two overlapping pseudoknotted stems.)",

Moreover there is limited opportunity for the user to provide structural information, or constraints, that can guide prediction. In cases of a prediction method that incorporates user-defined constraints, it is also useful to understand the degree to which the method\u2019s accuracy persists as the input information degrades. We use the term robustness with respect to partial information or robustness to refer to this property of a method. (We note that in our definition of robustness we do not mean robust with respect to noise.) To the best of our knowledge, the concept of robustness in secondary structure prediction methods has not been studied before.",

Our method, Iterative HFold, takes a pseudoknot-free input structure and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold incorporates four different methods and reports as its final structure the structure with the lowest energy, among all structures produced by these methods. While one of its underlying methods, HFold, strictly adheres to the hierarchical folding hypothesis, the other three use iterations to extend or remove the base pairs of input structure, with the goal of finding a structure that has lower energy than the structure found by HFold. Thus, unlike HFold, iterative HFold is able to modify the input structure (while the class of structures handled by both methods is the same). This is valuable since 1) computationally produced structures may not be completely accurate and 2) while the hierarchical folding hypothesis is a useful guiding principle, there is evidence that allowing for disruption of some base pairs in the initially formed pseudoknot-free secondary structure can improve prediction [53,54].",

HFold-PKonly is especially useful for cases when the user has either complete information about the true pseudoknot-free structure or wants to check whether a single stem of the input structure can be part of a pseudoknot since, if the input structure only has the specific stem in question, the output structure of HFold-PKonly will determine if the given stem can be part of a pseudoknot.",

In contrast, one of the best heuristic methods, HotKnots V2.0, takes 1.7 hours and 91 GB of memory for a sequence with 400 nucleotides. Therefore our method is practical for prediction of long RNA structures. Iterative HFold bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average accuracy of pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set is significantly higher than that of IPknot, ((72.83%, 83.37%) vs. (54.56%, 66.25%)) and is comparable to that of HotKnots V2.0, (vs. (73.60%, 83.35%)) two of the best prediction methods available. Iterative HFold\u2019s accuracy is significantly higher than that of IPknot and HotKnots on our IP-pk168 data set. Iterative HFold also has higher accuracy than HFold even when just partial information about the true pseudoknot-free structure is provided, so it is more robust than HFold. Specifically, Iterative HFold\u2019s average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure, and improves with a more modest but still positive improvement in accuracy when further structural information is provided.",

We then report the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of this distribution (i.e., the bootstrap distribution of the 104 average F-measures calculated above) as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval respectively, and call it the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval. By reporting the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average F-measure of a method, A, on a data set, D, we say that we are 95% confident that the average F-measure of method A on data set D is in the reported interval.

Iterative HFold continues to be significantly superior to HFold until approximately 90% of Gbig is available, after which HFold is more accurate. Iterative HFold is most successful when little information about Gbig is known because it can add both pseudoknot-free and pseudoknotted base pairs. In particular, using methods 3 and 4 (see Section \u2018Iterative HFold\u2019) Iterative HFold first finds a low energy pseudoknot-free structure that includes the given input structure (by extending the stems of the given structure), and then adds pseudoknotted base pairs to further lower the energy of the overall structure. However, when the vast majority of base pairs of Gbig are provided as input, HFold dominates as it keeps the base pairs of the input structure, thereby often adding base pairs of Gsmall. When 100% of Gbig is provided as input, HFold\u2019s bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval is (85.74%,91.87%), compared with (79.36%,87.41%) for Iterative HFold.As shown in Figure 2A, Iterative HFold\u2019s average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from about 54% to 79% as the user provides 1% to 40% of the input structure. This improvement in accuracy slows down but still persists when further structural information is provided. If we compare the slope of the curve for Iterative HFold\u2019s average accuracy to that of HFold in Figure 2A, we can see that HFold\u2019s slope is steeper than that of Iterative HFold, making Iterative HFold more robust than HFold.",

We chose SimFold as it is an implementation of MFold and, because of its energy parameters, gives more accurate predictions than MFold.

We note that our results on the IP-pk168 data set with different weight parameters perfectly match the results of Sato et al. [42].",

This method incorporates SHAPE reactivity data as a pseudo energy term into the prediction method. SHAPE reactivity data is only available for a limited number of RNA sequences, so we cannot compare Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots on our data set. Therefore, we use data set of Hajdin et al. to compare these two methods. In their data set Hajdin et al. have 18 RNA sequences in their training set and 6 RNA sequences in their test set. We run Iterative HFold with hotspots for each RNA sequence and choose the lowest energy structure as the final output of our program. For Shapeknots, we use the sensitivity and positive predictive values reported in the work of Hajdin et al. [47] to compare with Iterative HFold. Table 5 shows the results of this comparison. In all but one sequence of the test set, Iterative HFold obtains higher accuracy than ShapeKnots. The exception is the HIV-1 5\u2019 pseudoknot domain; Hajdin et al. note that the accepted structure of HIV-1 5\u2019 pseudoknot domain is based on a SHAPE directed prediction and thus an accuracy comparison between ShapeKnots and Iterative HFold may be biased towards ShapeKnots. In the training set, however, Iterative HFold does not perform as well as ShapeKnots. This might be because parameters of ShapeKnots were tuned on the training set to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Since both the training and test data sets are small, we cannot make more general statements about the significance of the differences in accuracy between the two methods.",

With this approach, the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measure of HFold and Iterative HFold is (61.80%, 80.63%) and (67.70%, 79.57%) respectively for pseudoknotted structures and (77.17%, 82.35%) and (76.27%, 81.46%) respectively for pseudoknot-free structures.

Although the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence intervals for average F-measures seem different, the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant.

An alternative approach that may be worth exploring in future work would be to use the most highly probable base pairs, as calculated using the partition function [43].
