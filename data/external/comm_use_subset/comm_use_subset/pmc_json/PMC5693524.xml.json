However, documentation of FeLV is becoming more common in wild felid species less closely related to the genus Felis, which highlights the omnipresent threat that FeLV represents to the conservation of wild felids worldwide. FeLV has been shown to represent a major threat to the survival of critically endangered populations of Iberian lynxes (Lynx pardinus) in Europe [18, 19] and to Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) in North America [20, 21]. In Brazil, antibodies against FeLV have been detected in two free-ranging pumas (Puma concolor) and two jaguarundis; FeLV DNA was detected in the following captive felids: an ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), an oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus) and two jaguarundis [22\u201324].",

            "text": "For domestic cats, the detection of the structural viral protein FeLV p27 in serum or plasma is used as a marker of infection and, in most cases, as a parameter for viremia. The outcomes of FeLV infection vary according to infectious challenge dose, route of challenge, and possibly host susceptibility and virus strain. The classification of FeLV outcomes in the domestic cat has been refined using sensitive molecular assays that detect and quantify proviral FeLV DNA and viral FeLV RNA, in addition to traditional serological and virological methods [25\u201330]. In this regard, the main host response categories of FeLV infection in domestic cats have been redefined as abortive, regressive, and progressive infection. In short, those cats that abort infection do not show any evidence of virus infection, except for seroconversion. Cats with regressive infection overcome viremia after an undetectable or transient initial phase by means of efficient cellular and humoral immune responses. These cats seroconvert, permanently harbor low to moderate FeLV proviral loads integrated in mononuclear cells, i.e., lymphocytes, and may or may not clear their plasma viral RNA loads [25, 27, 31]. Cats with progressive infection are constantly viremic, have low or no antibodies to FeLV, show elevated FeLV proviral and viral loads in peripheral blood cells and plasma and may develop FeLV-associated disease [25, 26, 28, 29].",

Jaguarundis #1 and #4 were both antigenemic. Antigenemia is usually used as a measure for viremia in domestic cats and is consistently found in domestic cats with a progressive FeLV infection outcome [26, 28]. Additionally, blood, buffy coat, serum and tissue samples from both jaguarundis were positive for FeLV proviral DNA and viral RNA with high proviral and viral loads, respectively (Table 4). While the presence of proviral DNA attests to the integration of provirus into blood cells, the detection of viral RNA usually indicates replicating virus. Once the infection outcome has been established, high proviral and FeLV RNA loads are characteristically found in cats with progressive infection, while low loads are detected in cats with regressive infection that are provirus positive but not viremic at the time [25, 29, 50]. FeLV proviral and viral RNA loads were measured in the two FeLV-positive jaguarundis #1 and #4. Comparison of the FeLV tissue loads of jaguarundi #1 revealed loads similar to those reported earlier for domestic cats with progressive infection using identical methods. Viral RNA loads in serum from the two FeLV-positive jaguarundis were comparable to those described earlier in persistently antigenemic cats [30]. The viral RNA load in the clinically healthy jaguarundi #1 was slightly lower than that in jaguarundi #4, which showed weight loss, vomiting, anorexia and diarrhea before death. This is also similar to previous findings from a study in cats, comparing viremic healthy and viremic ill cats [51]. Moreover, consistent with findings in domestic cats with a progressive FeLV infection, no antibodies to FeLV antigens were detected in jaguarundis #1 and #4.",

The female jaguarundi #2 had a history of direct contact with the two jaguarundis with progressive FeLV infection, #1 and #4: she was a sibling of jaguarundi #1 and had mated with the male #4. This would explain how she was exposed to FeLV, either at the same time as her sibling #1 or during mating with #4. Subsequently, jaguarundi #2 gave birth to jaguarundi #23, who did not show any signs of FeLV exposure (Tables 1, 2, 4). This may well be the case, since the mother, #2, had developed an antibody response and probably had never shed FeLV (abortive infection). It is unknown for how long and at what virus challenge conditions jaguarundi #2 was exposed, as animals were naturally and not experimentally infected in the present study. Overall, we speculate that jaguarundi #2 developed an abortive FeLV infection for similar (and possibly several) reasons that may drive FeLV abortive infections in some domestic cats. The parents of male jaguarundi #22 were the FeLV-negative male jaguarundi #5 and the female #7. Thus, it is unknown at what time point jaguarundi #22 was exposed to FeLV.",

These data motivated the search for possible FeLV involvement in the appearance of the neoplastic intra-abdominal mass in jaguarundi #5. Although jaguarundi #5 had not shown any evidence of FeLV infection intra vitam (Table 1), we further investigated whether FeLV antigens or proviruses were present in intestinal lymphoid cells and whether these cells produced FeLV viral RNA locally without it entering the bloodstream \u2013 as would be expected in a case of sequestered FeLV infection [4]. However, no FeLV antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry and no FeLV provirus or viral RNA were detected by molecular assays. Infection with FIV, which is a lentivirus associated with lymphomagenesis in domestic cats [56], was not detected by the commercial immunoassay, and only antibodies specific to FIV p24 capsid proteins were detected by Western blot, which may be indicative of an early or very late FIV infection or may have resulted from unspecific cross-reactivity. The FIV RT-PCR assays performed from whole blood were negative; however, this may be due to low viral loads or lack of specificity of the assays due to sequence diversity of different FIV isolates. In conclusion, jaguarundi #5 had developed a non FeLV-associated intestinal B-cell lymphoma; involvement of FIV in the development of the neoplasia cannot completely be ruled out.",

The fTHTR1 complementary DNA (cDNA) from that animal had shown 99% nucleotide and amino acid identity to the fTHTR1 cDNA sequences of the domestic cat and other wild felid species, such as the lynx (Lynx pardinus), African lion (P. leo bleyenberghi), Asiatic lion (P. leo persica), and European wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris) [57]. In addition, fTHTR1 was quantified by real-time PCR in a few tissues from two jaguarundis where tissue was available (the viremic jaguarundi #1 and jaguarundi #5, which developed a tumor, but was not FeLV-infected).These limited results showed no significant difference between the fTHTR1 tissue loads in cat and jaguarundi tissue (results not shown). However, it also needs to be mentioned that the real-time PCR assay was designed for the domestic cat THTR1 and not the jaguarundi THTR1. Two-point mutations can be found in the region of the assay: one-point mutation in the middle of the forward primer and one in the probe. Thus, although similar fTHTR1 expression levels were found in jaguarundi tissue compared with cat tissue, we cannot exclude differences in the efficiency of the real-time PCR assay. These findings support the perspective that the first phase of the FeLV virus cycle \u2013 viral entry \u2013 might be similar among domestic cats and other wild felid species.",

Moreover, the highly virulent FeLV-C was not detected. In FeLV-infected Iberian lynxes, enFeLV sequences were also not detected, but their FeLV-A variants were shown to be highly virulent, suggesting that the mechanisms inducing disease in these wild felids might be distinct from those in domestic cats [19].",

It is unknown at what time point each of the jaguarundis became infected. The reproductive success achieved for jaguarundis in captivity is probably a result of the breeding program conceived for small felids at FPZSP [62] and a number of measures for improving the well-being of the animals, including the location of the jaguarundi enclosures in an isolated and forested area of the zoo away from the public. Nonetheless, domestic cats commonly are seen invading the zoo, especially the more isolated areas, and they were probably the source of infection of FeLV for the jaguarundis. Domestic cats are the main reservoir for FeLV worldwide and greatly outnumber FeLV-infected wild felids. Given this, it is prudent to prevent the presence of domestic cats in nature reserves, zoos and other settings with captive wild felids and to reinforce the importance of control measures for FeLV in domestic cats, such as testing and vaccination.",
