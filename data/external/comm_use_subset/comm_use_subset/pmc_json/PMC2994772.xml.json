However, an analysis of the impact of this novel virus in a highly susceptible population, such as cancer patients, through clinical and virological perspectives, needs to be highlighted [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. The atypical clinical presentation of influenza infections in cancer patients, which delays clinical suspicion, antiviral treatment and adequate prevention of viral transmission, is a major challenge for clinical management in this population [12]. Cancer patients are more likely to suffer from severe seasonal influenza infections [12], [13], [14] and prolonged viral shedding, as has been reported for an H3N2 seasonal virus [15]. Prolonged shedding and the development of oseltamivir resistance in cancer patients infected with the H1N1pdm virus have not been thoroughly evaluated. Data on these aspects could have major implications for the clinical management and infection control practices for H1N1pdm-infected cancer patients [16].",

Among these, 20 patients were confirmed to be positive for the H1N1pdm virus using rRT-PCR (Figure 1 and Table S1). The remaining four patients were positive for influenza A using IFI only. Considering the pandemic case definitions with reference to international guidelines [17], these last four cases were categorized as H1N1pdm-confirmed cases. Altogether, these 24 cases constituted the study population. All of the respiratory samples collected from the 20 rRT-PCR-confirmed patients were inoculated in cell cultures. We recovered the virus from 13 individuals after at least two passages in MDCKs, constituting 15 isolated samples.

We observed that samples collected a month apart (5645s2/09 and 5645s3/09) clustered together and displayed a relatively large branch length from other H1N1pdm viruses (Figure 3). This result may have occurred because strain 5645s2/09 diverged from CA/04 in the amino acid residues L52S, L70P, P100S, C153L, T214A, Q293R and I321V (H1 numbering). Additionally, isolate 5645s3/09, which was sequenced from amino acid residues 167 to 413, also had the mutations T214A, Q293R and I321V fixed in the viral population a month after the initial sampling. In the isolate 5645s3/09, another mutation was also acquired, D238P, suggesting continuous viral evolution.

Thus, oseltamivir carboxylate IC50 values were measured for 15 H1N1pdm samples isolated from 13 patients. We found that 10 isolates were sensitive (0.85\u00b10.27 nM), and 5 displayed high IC50 values for the antiviral used (165.13\u00b142.26 nM). These samples were sent to the WHO collaborating center at the CDC in Atlanta for resistance confirmation. We found that the isolates with high IC50 values were endowed with a neuraminidase (NA) activity that was cross-resistant to oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir, suggesting the presence of a co-pathogen endowed with NA activity within these isolates. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses (coronavirus (229, 43 and 63), parainfluenza (1, 2, 3 and 4), human metapneumovirus, parechovirus, rhinovirus, RSV A/B, adenovirus and enterovirus) or atypical bacteria (Mycobacterium pneumonia) were not identified in these samples, suggesting that no other viral source of NA activity was responsible for these high IC50 values. However, we co-isolated a Streptococcus sp. from the samples with high IC50 values. The NA activity of this bacterial strain displayed a phenotype resistant to NAIs. In further testing with bacteria-free H1N1pdm isolates, the virus' IC50 were consistent with a sensitive isolate. Pyrosequencing analyses were also performed and revealed that the other high-IC50 samples had the WT H275 residue and thus did not contain this oseltamivir resistance marker. Viruses isolated from the initial onset of illness were A/California/07-like viruses (Figure S2).",

            "text": "Influenza shedding is not considered to last long, and it disappears seven days after the onset (2.4 and 4.5 days for oseltamivir- and placebo-treated groups, respectively) [30]. Studies aimed at monitoring 2009 H1N1pdm virus shedding using randomized trials with appropriate controls, such as outpatients and hospitalized or immunocompromised individuals, have not yet been conducted. Because we were also unable to establish age-matched controls with or without immunosuppression, since this study was conducted during the peak of the first wave of the 2009 pandemics in Brazil, we compared our work to other studies on H1N1pdm shedding in general, hospitalized or immunocompromised populations [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. In Table 2, we summarize the cohort used in each study, whether or not they were immunocompromised, their underlying diseases and the number of patients analyzed for viral shedding in each of these studies. We compared the maximum periods of shedding among these different populations and the number of patients that secreted the virus for more than seven days. These data would be more informative and relevant from a public health point of view because the duration of the quarantine for H1N1pdm was approximately that long [21]. We found (Table 2) that in households in Hong Kong [31] and Canada [34], the maximum periods of H1N1pdm shedding ranged from 8 to 11 days. These periods were not different from what was observed with military cadets [22] and during the containment phase of the pandemics in Vietnam [23] (Table 2). Regarding H1N1pdm shedding among infants, Hien et al. showed that children five to nine years old could secrete the H1N1pdm virus for five to six days, which is markedly lower than what is observed for the seasonal influenza virus [30], [33]. Compared to our results, we observed higher periods of viral shedding in two seven-year-old patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Table 2 and Figure 2). However, a single report on two travelers in France showed that these apparently immunocompetent individuals secreted the H1N1pdm virus for 14 and 28 days [25] (Table 2). Although these periods of time are comparable to the time frame of virus secretion in hospitalized patients in China [23] and our work, the study from Felury et al. might be as biased as ours by the small size of the cohort (Table 2). Influenza-infected immunocompromised individuals may have prolonged influenza shedding [15], [21], [32], [36]; however, more insights are necessary to better comprehend the dynamics of the H1N1pdm virus in these individuals. Mora et al. showed that in HIV-1-infected individuals, co-infection with the H1N1pdm virus might lead to an outcome not different from the one expected for immunocompetent subjects, although no systematic analysis of viral shedding was performed [36]. A similar conclusion was also drawn for transplant recipient individuals, whose longest periods of viral shedding did not exceed 11 days [32] (Table 2). In our study, we found periods of H1N1pdm shedding similar to what the CDC observed for leukemia patients [21] (Table 2). Although the small size of these cohorts of immunocompromised individuals [21], [32], including ours, may require a more conclusive and mechanistic analysis, these observations may stimulate further systematic studies to understand or gain insight into factors associated with prolonged H1N1pdm shedding. In addition, it might give insights on basic studies on influenza pathogenesis.",

Notably, five isolates from two patients had high IC50 values to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). An NA activity that was multi-resistant to NAIs was identified and could be due to the presence of a Streptococcus strain found in throat swabs and tracheal aspirates. Pyrosequencing analyses of samples with high IC50 values revealed that these specimens were H275 wild-type sensitive viruses. These results reinforce the need for additional genotyping assays to confirm the identification of putative resistant strains identified using functional assays. In addition, our findings show the need for investigating other sources of NA activity in virus isolates with odd IC50 values.",

Because our investigation started during a new pandemic, the clinical evaluation and management protocols changed during the course of the study as new data emerged from the literature and from updated recommendations [45]. As the pandemic reached its peak in South America, the establishment of a larger and more diverse cohort with age-matched controls with or without immunosuppression became complex. Thus, more in-depth multivariate and mechanistic clinical analyses were limited. Moreover, no recommendations for monitoring viral persistence were available; therefore, only a subset of severely ill patients admitted to the ICU was evaluated. Despite that, an important connection between clinical and laboratory information was studied, revealing the continuous evolution of H1N1pdm HA sequences and the stability of the NA gene in severely ill patients [14].",

Patients' clinical samples were directly tested for a panel of respiratory viruses using an IFI assay for influenza A (respiratory virus panel; Biotrin, Mount Merrion, Co. Dublin, Ireland.). Specimens were also sent to the Brazilian National Influenza Center (IOC/Fiocruz) for H1N1pdm confirmation using rRT-PCR, which was performed in accordance with the current guidelines from the WHO/CDC [46]. Viral shedding was evaluated in the subset of patients that remained under mechanical ventilation for longer than seven days and in those patients with persistent hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrate. These patients received a specific number to which their sample number was appended. That is, the first sample was \u201cs1\u201d, and subsequent specimens were numbered consecutively (Table S12). Viral secretion was evaluated using both cell culture and rRT-PCR assays until it was negative. Virus isolation was performed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and/or embryonated eggs (see Text S1 and Table S12).
