Vaccination is the best method to control the disease, and the current widely used commercial IBV vaccines are live-attenuated or inactivated viruses with adjuvants derived from classical or variant serotypes [13], however, live-attenuated IBV vaccine strains have some limitations, including genetic instability, reversion to virulence, and recombination between vaccine and wild-type viruses [14]. IBV-inactivated vaccines also face some defects such as lack of ability to elicit strong cellular immune responses and lack of cross-immunoprotective effects. Furthermore, chicken flocks suffer co-infection with IBV and avian orthoavulavirus-1 (AOAV-1), which is a member of the genus Orthoavulavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae, often referred to as Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [15], which hinders the prevention and control of these diseases [16,17]. These two pathogens remain a vital threat to domestic poultry production [18,19,20,21]. Thus, it would be advantageous to develop a next-generation vaccine that could serve as a bivalent vaccine against IBV and NDV challenge. ",

            "text": "In recent years, epitope-based vaccines have been widely studied for their advantages, including safety, genetic stability, ease of production, and the ability to elicit immune responses against multi serotype pathogens. [22,23]. Thus, they have been broadly applied for a range of viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases [24,25,26]. The most important factors for designing a multi-epitope vaccine are predicting and screening the functional neutralizing B cell epitopes and species-restricted T cell epitopes [27,28]. IBV spike glycoprotein (S) is proteolytically cleaved into a 92-kDa S1 subunit and a 84-kDa S2 subunit, and these play an important role in viral infections [29]. The S1 subunit possesses a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is primarily responsible for adsorption and entry into host cells. Epitopes of neutralizing antibodies are also found mainly on the S1 subunit [30,31]. Therefore, the S1 protein has an indispensable effect on the protective immune response of IBV. Our previously constructed IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette includes sequences encoding neutralizing epitope domains (aa 24\u201361, aa 132\u2013149, and aa 291\u2013398) of IBV Australian T strain (Genbank AY775779.1) and BF2-restricted CTL epitopes aa 413\u2013421 and aa 517\u2013525 of the QX-like IBV SH1208 strain, which shares an ancestor with the SAIBK strain (Genbank DQ288927.1), and aa 45\u201352 and aa 413\u2013421 of the Holte strain (Genbank L18988.1). The immune-protection experiment demonstrated that the recombinant DNA vaccine, consisting of this IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette, could induce a high level of immune responses and full protection of chickens against a lethal dose of IBV challenge [26,32]. The results indicated that the multi-epitope-based vaccine provides a promising strategy for vaccine development against IBV infection. ",

Especially in layer and breeder chickens, a decline in egg production alone can cause significant economic losses. However, IBV and NDV live vaccines probably mutually interfere with concurrent immunization [45,46,47]. Furthermore, a live-attenuated IBV vaccine is at risk of virulence recovery, contributing to emergence of new IBV variants. Thus, it is necessary to develop a novel bivalent vaccine protect against NDV and IBV. In recent decades, attempts have been made to develop recombinant vaccines using NDV [48,49,50], adenovirus [51], duck enteritis virus [52], and avian metapneumovirus [53] viral backbones expressing the S1 or S2 portion of the IBV spike gene with differing levels of protection from IBV challenge. Among them, the NDV vector shows great promise due to its excellent characteristics, such as rapid and long-lasting immune response, low production costs, convenience of administration, and genetic stability [45]. The avirulent NDV strain LaSota is an ideal vector that has been approved for use as a vaccine and is widely used worldwide [49]. It should be noted that the maternally derived antibodies of one-day-old chicks probably interfere with LaSota vaccine immunity. Thus, NDV maternal antibodies might be investigated before LaSota vaccination on commercial chickens. ",

The IBV protection rate was analogous to that of a recombinant NDV expressing the full-length S protein of the IBV M41 strain, reported by Shirvani, et al. [48]. These authors found that only recombinant NDV, expressing the full-length S protein, could completely protect against IBV challenge; recombinant NDV expressing only S1 or S2 subunits could not. In contrast, in this study, the rNDV-IBV-T/B, expressing epitopes derived from the S1 subunits of the Holte, Australian T, and QX-like SH1208 IBV strains, provided 90% protection against heterologous IBV M41 strain challenge. We speculate that the conserved epitopes, especially neutralizing epitopes, play an important role in the heterologous IBV cross-protection. [54,55]. Whether the rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccine potentially broadly protects against more heterologous IBV strains needs to be determined in further experiments.",

            "text": "Abozeid et al. [50] reported a similar design strategy as that of Shirvani et al. [48] but modified the IBV S protein and rescued three recombinant LaSota strains. Immune-protection experiments show that candidate vaccines can alleviate the severity of clinical symptoms but does not reduce virus shedding. However, prime-boost immunization with rNDV expressing wild-type IBV S protein can significantly reduce tracheal virus shedding after IBV attack. In contrast, our study found that rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination strongly protected the chickens, as well as significantly inhibited IBV virus shedding, while also maintaining trachea ciliary activity. This is probably due to the high level of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the IBV multi-epitope vaccine effectively neutralizing the virus. Toro et al. employed the prime-boost immunization strategy to evaluate the efficacy of the recombinant NDV vaccine, rLS/IBV.S2. The results demonstrated that overexposing IBV S2 to the chicken immune system by means of a vectored vaccine, followed by boosting with the whole virus, protects chickens against heterologous IBV [56]. This strategy is a practical immunization procedure applied to protect against various pathogens [57]. This study shows that rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccine could cross-protect against the heterologous IBV M41 strain and indicates that the potency of the rNDV-IBV-T/B could perhaps facilitate the simplified immunization procedures and reduce the production cost. Even more, the results described in this study were obtained with a single-dose immunization, which is highly desirable in poultry vaccines.",
