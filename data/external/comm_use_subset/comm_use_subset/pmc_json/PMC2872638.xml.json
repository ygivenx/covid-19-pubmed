The major intestinal schistosomes, Schistosoma japonicum, found in Asia, and S. mansoni, found in Africa, the Americas and the Middle East, mature, mate and lay eggs in the portal and mesenteric blood vessels. Eggs are transported to the liver where they are encapsulated and the granulomas that form induce an inflammatory cascade that includes the deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix proteins, a normal liver repair process that can lead to fibrosis when fibrogenesis exceeds the replacement of scar tissue with healthy cells [5], [6]. The immune regulation of this process is currently being explored [7]. Approximately 700,000 people are infected with S. japonicum in China [8]. As in other parts of the world, schistosomiasis control efforts have focused primarily on the distribution of the antischistosomal drug, praziquantel [9], [10]. However the success of such efforts hinges on the ability to reduce not only schistosomiasis infections, but also morbidity. A means of documenting S. japonicum morbidity is essential to the evaluation of disease control efforts [11].",

            "text": "Ultrasound is a non-invasive method that can be used to evaluate fibrosis resulting from schistosomiasis infection. Fibrosis along the portal vein and its branches produces a clay pipestem pattern, as the portal tracks are lined with fibrous tissue, and is observed following both S. mansoni and S. japonicum infection. This periportal fibrosis can be assessed qualitatively through image classification [12] or quantitatively by measuring the diameter of three secondary portal branches [13]. Unique to S. japonicum infection is parenchymal fibrosis, a network pattern that is often described as fish scale or tortoise shell-like. Parenchymal fibrosis is likely due to the smaller S. japonicum egg size which allows the parasite eggs to enter smaller portal veins and reach a greater portion of the liver [7]. S. japonicum adult females produce ten times more eggs per day than S. mansoni, and the eggs often are deposited in clusters, two additional factors that exacerbate the severity of S. japonicum morbidity relative to other schistosome species and may contribute to the unique fibrotic pattern [3]. Ultrasound can also be used to assess hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and dilation of the portal vein, all of which result from portal hypertension. Recognizing the potential of ultrasound to be used to evaluate the impact of disease control efforts, draft protocols for the use of ultrasound in assessing schistosomiasis morbidity were established for each of the three major schistosome species in 1990 [13], [14]. Follow-up meetings to refine the protocols for S. haematobium and S. mansoni were held in 1996 and 1997 [15]. Ultrasound is considered the gold standard for schistosomiasis morbidity assessment for these species [11]. However, due to insufficient evidence the protocol for S. japonicum has not been revised.",

Li et al. [16], [17] offer the most complete examination of the proposed ultrasound measures to date, tracking a highly exposed cohort over five years, but as standard organ sizes have only recently been published [18], assessments of liver and spleen enlargement did not account for participant height as currently recommended [15]. Failure to account for height-specific variation in organ sizes can lead to underestimates of morbidity, particularly in pediatric populations [19]. Ideally, ultrasound measures are associated with S. japonicum infection and decline following treatment [13]. The available data is conflicting on both criteria. Treatment led to declines in parenchymal and periportal fibrosis in a highly exposed Chinese cohort; however 68% of participants experienced no change in parenchymal fibrosis over a five-year period [16], [17] and other studies have not found significant declines in periportal fibrosis following S. japonicum treatment [20], [21]. Further, a direct relationship between infection and fibrosis or measures of portal hypertension has not been demonstrated consistently [16], [17], [22].",

Measurements greater than two standard deviations above the mean size for height were classified as abnormal. Height was measured in 2002 in 440 of the 578 cohort members. The 343 adults (\u226518 years old in 2000) with height measurements were assigned their 2002 height throughout the study. Children (<18 years old in 2000) were measured again in 2007 as part of a study described elsewhere [19]. The height measurements from 2002 and 2007 from 119 children (60 with 1 height measurement, 59 with two height measurements) were used to generate an age- and sex-dependent random intercept model in order to impute heights during the years children weren't measured. Height for child i at time j was calculated using the following equation:where Aij represents a child's age at time j, Si represents his or her sex (S = 1 for males) and  represents his or her random intercept. The model was fit using xtmixed in Stata 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and  was predicted using empirical Bayes [25]. As random intercept models assume parametric distribution of residuals, first and second order residuals were examined and were normally distributed. The selected model was superior to a model that did not include a random intercept (likelihood ratio test, \u03c72 = 38.20, 1 d.f., p<0.001). Organ and vessel measures could not be height adjusted for the 86 adults and 26 children without height measurements. Participants with any versus no height data did not differ significantly by any of the predictors examined in the analyses including sex, mean age or infection status. No height standardized values were available for spleen vein diameter, so it was evaluated by the standard threshold used in China: >8 mm [24].",

For each hatch test, a stool sample weighing at least 30 g was suspended in aqueous solution, filtered using copper mesh to remove large particles (40\u201360 mesh) followed by nylon gauze (260 mesh) to concentrate schistosome eggs. This sediment was re-suspended with distilled water in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. Flasks were examined for miracidia 30\u201360 minutes, 4 hours and 8 hours after suspension if temperatures were above 30 degrees Celsius, or at 6, 12 and 18 hours at lower ambient temperatures. In 2000, three miracidial hatch tests were conducted per person using stool samples from three distinct days. In 2002, due to logistical constraints, one miracidial hatch test was conducted per person; however the Kato-Katz protocol was identical both years. The Kato-Katz procedure involved the preparation of three 41.5 mg slides from one homogenized stool sample in 2000 and 2002. Infection intensity, in eggs per gram of stool (EPG), was calculated as the total number of S. japonicum eggs present on the slides divided by the total sample weight. Participants were classified as infected if at least one test was positive. Everyone testing positive for S. japonicum was provided praziquantel treatment by the county Anti-Schistosomiasis Control Station. In addition, praziquantel was administered to all residents in the study villages in 2003, as part of a nation-wide effort to control infectious diseases following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.",

Because infection intensity was highly right skewed, it was categorized into approximate quartiles among those who were infected. In order to examine the role of past infection on current morbidity, we also examined the relationship between infection status and intensity two to three years prior to the ultrasound examination and ultrasound-detected abnormalities (for example: 2000 infection status as a predictor of ultrasound-detected morbidity in 2002, and 2002 infection status as a predictor of ultrasound-detected morbidity in 2005). We hypothesized that age, sex and year of examination could modify the effect of infection on morbidity, so each model was run including all possible first-order interaction terms. The Wald test was used to test for significant interactions and if present, terms were removed from the model step-wise until only interaction terms significant at p-values <0.05 remained. In the absence of effect modification, these same variables could confound the relationship between infection and ultrasound-detected morbidity. While occupation, village and educational status were considered potential predictors of S. japonicum infection, they are unlikely to effect ultrasound morbidity independent of infection status. As they do not fit the definition of confounders [33], they were not controlled for in models examining the relationship between infection and ultrasound-detected abnormalities. The change in ultrasound-detected abnormalities over time was examined adjusting for age and sex.",

Prior infection was associated with increased odds of right liver lobe enlargement among males examined in 2005 (OR 3.95, 95% CI: 1.82\u20138.57) and decreased odds of right liver lobe enlargement among females examined in 2002 (OR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13\u20130.86). Prior infection intensity was not associated with right or left liver lobe enlargement. Due to the limited number of individuals with periportal fibrosis, models were unable to yield stable estimates of the effect of prior infection on this measure Spleen enlargement and spleen vein dilation were not associated with current or prior infection.",

Others have used image-based classification to assess periportal fibrosis [34], [35], which has been shown to have better reproducibility for S. mansoni-related fibrosis, perhaps because it does not require the ultrasonographer to measure narrow vessel widths [36]. Our measures of periportal fibrosis were not height adjusted, as Chinese standards for the diameter of portal vein branches as measured here have not been published. The lack of height adjustment may have led to underestimates of the prevalence of periportal fibrosis and may explain the higher prevalence of periportal fibrosis in men, however higher prevalence of fibrosis has also been observed in males using image-based classification [35].",

The spleen measures were neither associated with infection nor did they decline with treatment. All five measures require the ultrasonographer to measure organ or vessel sizes and participant's height. Like the measures of periportal fibrosis used here, these methods present opportunities for measurement error which may bias estimates of exposure-disease relationships toward the null, producing attenuation and exacerbating non-linearity [37].

The strong associations between age and all liver measures highlight the importance of considering age as a potential confounder when examining the relationship between S. japonicum infection and morbidity and declines in morbidity over time.

While treatment with praziquantel can reduce infection prevalence, intensity and fibrosis, this analysis provides further evidence that severe hepatic fibrosis may be unlikely to reverse quickly.

The surprising association between past infection and fibrosis raises questions about the progression of fibrosis following infection and treatment. Praziquantel kills the adult worm but schistosome eggs can remain trapped in host tissues decades after exposure [43]. While schistosome eggs are thought to disintegrate within weeks of granuloma formation [7], it is possible, due to an inflammatory cascade, fibrogenesis continues over a longer time period. Collagen deposition has been shown to occur following treatment with praziquantel in S. japonicum infected mice, suggesting fibrosis may continue despite removal of adult worms [44]. In humans, progression of fibrosis has been observed following treatment and was not explained by reinfection [21], [45]. Alternatively, it is possible that the relationship between past infection and fibrosis is due to reinfection. Past infection predicted subsequent infection. However, if reinfection rather than past infection determined fibrosis, one would expect stronger relationships between current infection and fibrosis than between past infection and fibrosis, which was not observed. It is also possible that some individuals who were treated were not cured. A single dose of praziquantel cures 90% of S. japonicum infections [46], suggesting 10% of those treated may continue to harbor adult worms and face continued egg production. In our work in this region, we have also found individuals who decline to take praziquantel even after a positive infection test. Non-compliance and treatment failure are realities of any chemotherapy-based control program, however the marked declines in infection prevalence, intensity and morbidity suggest the number of individuals who were not cured was limited.",

Participants were randomly sampled from a comprehensive cross-sectional survey in order to minimize selection bias. Loss to follow-up was greater among those without ultrasound-detectable morbidity, which suggests the prevalence of morbidity in 2002 and 2005 may be overestimated, and therefore the true declines in morbidity over time may be greater than observed. Retention was independent of infection status, minimizing bias in estimates of the impact of infection on pathology. No information was available on alcohol consumption or infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), two factors that can induce liver pathology and may exacerbate schistosomiasis morbidity. The parenchymal network pattern due to S. japonicum is distinct from the lesions produced by HBV, as HBV produces a finer, meshwork texture [47], suggesting the observed prevalence of parenchymal fibrosis is specific to schistosomiasis. While HBV has been shown to hinder regression of periportal fibrosis following treatment of S. mansoni infections [41], the extent to which HBV exacerbates morbidity due to S. japonicum remains unclear and warrants further study. Reductions in parenchymal fibrosis may be impaired by alcohol consumption, which in our study areas is confined almost exclusively to males [17]. Unless alcohol consumption or HBV impacts a person's probability of infection, they are unlikely to confound the relationships between infection and ultrasound-detected morbidity.",
