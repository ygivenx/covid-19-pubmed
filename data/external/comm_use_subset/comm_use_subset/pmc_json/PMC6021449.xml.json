Subsequent research on index cases13, serological sampling14, and virus isolation15 revealed a transmission from dromedaries to humans and confirmed dromedaries as the major reservoir for human infections16. Consequently, MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries was documented by serological surveys in large parts of the Middle East, the Canary Islands, and Africa, as previously summarized by Hemida et al.17 and additionally in certain parts of Southern Asia18 and Western Africa19. Recently, MERS-CoV has also been detected in alpacas from Qatar20, but not in any other domestic livestock species14.",

Viral antigen was additionally detected in regional lymph nodes but not in any other extra-respiratory organ21,22. The serine exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) has been identified as a major virus receptor in both humans and dromedaries23,24 and is expressed in the lower respiratory tract of humans and the upper respiratory tract of dromedaries25. More recently, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) has been described as an additional cellular binding target for MERS-CoV that may facilitates virus entry26. Additionally, binding of MERS-CoV to sialic acids has been demonstrated in a newly published study by Li and colleagues and is suggested to represent another important factor in viral host tropism27.",

The epithelial surface was covered multifocally by large amounts of mucus, as well as viable and degenerated neutrophilic granulocytes and cellular debris. Lamina propria and submucosa displayed mild to moderate edema and infiltration of moderate numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages as well as single neutrophilic granulocytes, which were predominantly located next to blood vessels. Histology of trachea and bronchi revealed only mild lesions which were characterized by mild exocytosis of neutrophilic granulocytes and mild, segmental infiltration of lamina propria and submucosa by lymphocytes, macrophages, and low numbers of neutrophilic granulocytes (Fig. 1C,D). Rarely epithelial erosion and accumulations of degenerated neutrophilic granulocytes within the apical epithelial layers (pustules) of the trachea were detected. The MVA-S-vaccinated animals showed similar but less severe lesions at 4 dpi in nasal turbinates, trachea, and bronchi which were rarely accompanied by degeneration, loss, and necrosis of single epithelial cells in the nasal turbinates. At 14 dpi, very mild lesions were detectable in nasal turbinates, trachea, and bronchi of all investigated animals (MVA-S-vaccinated and mock-vaccinated) characterized by mild, multifocal, lymphoplasmahistiocytic and neutrophilic infiltration of lamina propria and submucosa and rare exocytosis of neutrophilic granulocytes (data not shown). Rarely, follicular aggregates of lymphoid cells were detectable in the lamina propria and submucosa of nasal turbinates and trachea in both groups and at all investigated time points. Within pulmonary, tracheal and cervical lymph nodes as well as within tonsils mild to moderate follicular hyperplasia and single apoptotic lymphocytes were present. All other non-respiratory organs and the lungs did not show any significant lesions.",

Comparison of mock-vaccinated and MVA-S-vaccinated animals at that time point revealed significantly increased numbers of T cells within the nasal turbinates, but not within the trachea of mock-vaccinated animals.

Similarly, increased numbers of CD204+ macrophages were detected at 4 dpi compared to 14 dpi in nasal turbinates and trachea, but no significant differences were present between both groups at the respective time points (Fig. 3D\u2013F). The decrease of T cells and macrophages at 14 dpi is in line with the significant reduction of virus antigen at the respective time point (Fig. 2B,C). Immunohistochemistry for detection of CD20+ B cells did not reveal any differences between groups and time points in the nasal turbinates. However, at 4 dpi numbers of B cells were significantly increased in the trachea of MVA-S-vaccinated compared to mock-vaccinated animals and compared to the later time point (Fig. 3G\u2013I).",

Double staining revealed massive co-localization of both antigens in the epithelium of nasal turbinates and trachea (Fig. 4A,B). To further distinguish epithelial subsets in the upper respiratory tract tissue of dromedaries, antibodies specific for certain CK of apical and basal cells have been established and were evaluated regarding their distribution (Suppl. Fig. S1). Double immunofluorescence with these antibodies showed strong co-localization of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid with CK18 located in apical epithelial cells at 4 dpi in nasal turbinates and trachea (Fig. 4C,D). There was no co-localization with CK5/6 and CK14, expressed by basal epithelial cells, in any localization (Fig. 4E,F). Moreover, MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antigen was not identified in serous glands, located in the submucosa of the nasal turbinates, even if the apical proportion of these structures stained brightly positive for CK18 (Fig. 4C). At 14 dpi, localization of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antigen in the nasal turbinates of mock-vaccinated remained basically identical to the distribution at 4 dpi but the number of MERS-CoV positive staining cells was substantially reduced. In MVA-S-vaccinated animals the amount of virus antigen detected by immunofluorescence was very low at 4 dpi, but depicted similar co-localization with CK18.",

As an additional control, nasal tissue of a non-infected control animal was stained with the same antibody and showed a bright and continuous staining without segmental loss as expected. To confirm the massive loss of cilia in infected, mock-vaccinated animals, the respiratory epithelia of nasal turbinates and trachea were additionally investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM showed a widespread and significant loss of cilia in both organs compared to the tissue of the MVA-S-vaccinated animals at 4 dpi (Fig. 7A\u2013F). Since ciliary loss occurred frequently in association with infiltration of inflammatory cells into the epithelium but also in areas with rather mild inflammatory lesions restricted to lamina propria and submucosa, TUNEL assay was performed to determine whether the loss of cilia is directly related to virus-induced apoptosis of epithelial cells. Since the TUNEL assay revealed some but not abundant apoptotic cells in the respiratory epithelium (Suppl. Fig. S2) cilia-specific alterations by MERS-CoV must be assumed.",

Staining of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antigen with CD3 and CD20 antigen, respectively, did not reveal any co-localization, neither in the nasal turbinates nor in the trachea (Fig. 8A\u2013D). However, single cells within the lamina propria of the nasal turbinates stained simultaneously positive for Iba-1 and MERS-CoV nucleocapsid and were characterized by a macrophage-like morphology (Fig. 8E). In the trachea, double positive staining cell elements were absent (Fig. 8F). For further confirmation the reaction was repeated by use of another macrophage specific antibody. The anti-CD204-specific antibody exhibited an intense co-localization of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid and CD204 in single cells in the same localization. Overall, MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antigen was therefore not only detectable in CK18+ apical epithelial cells but also within the cytoplasm of single macrophages. However, co-localization of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid with Iba-1 and CD204, respectively, was not detected within the trachea, implicating that the presence of MERS-CoV in macrophages might be related to high virus loads in the respective localization.",

            "text": "It has recently been shown that dromedaries play a key role in the transmission of MERS-CoV at the animal-human interface16. In addition, experimentally infected dromedaries serve as an important animal model for investigations on certain aspects of MERS-CoV pathogenesis21,22. The use of appropriate animal models is highly required, since human tissue samples from individual MERS-CoV cases are rarely accessible29\u201331, which has in part been attributed to cultural reasons32. Two individual case descriptions detected viral particles via electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in pneumocytes, pulmonary macrophages, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, and macrophages within skeletal muscle. Biopsies revealed necrotizing pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar damage, vascular disease, cardiac fibrosis, acute kidney injury, hepatitis, and myositis30,31. These reports from human tissue underline that the disease observed in dromedaries after natural and experimental MERS-CoV infection differs substantially from the human counterpart. Whereas dromedaries develop only mild respiratory signs and lack overt pulmonary disease and systemic spread21,22, the disease in humans is often accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal dysfunction, and lethal outcome32. Previous studies indicated that these differences are related to the fact that MERS-CoV predominantly replicates in the lower respiratory tract of humans but not of dromedaries that might, at least in part, be caused by differing expression patterns of the cell surface receptor DPP4. Whereas DPP4 is extensively expressed in the upper respiratory tract epithelia of dromedaries, its expression in the respiratory tract of humans is limited to alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages in the lower airways25. In the present study, it has been shown that DPP4 is located on the apical brush border of ciliated CK18 expressing epithelia in the upper respiratory tract of dromedaries. In humans DPP4 can be detected in the brush border of renal proximal convoluted tubules and enterocytes in the intestine33 but not within the upper respiratory tract25.",

            "text": "The present study demonstrates that acute MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries is accompanied by severe ciliary loss and concomitant lack of DPP4 on infected cells. Adjacent cells in which MERS-CoV antigen is not detectable retain positive staining for DPP4. Ciliary loss and consequent disturbances of mucociliary clearance are a major issue in several viral infections and can foster the development of severe secondary bacterial disease34. For instance, common cold in humans is accompanied by a massive loss of cilia and ciliated cells35. Similarly, human coronavirus infection of the upper respiratory tract has been described to be associated with migration of axonemes and basal bodies into the cell body (internalization) complemented by loss of cilia on the apical cell surface of infected cells. For the human disease it has been suggested that replicated virions are stored in apical vesicles before they are released. These vesicles may dislocate the basal body and withdraw the cilia into the cell36. In dogs, canine respiratory coronavirus infection is also associated with loss and damage to tracheal cilia, accompanied by inflammation37. Similar mechanisms might also play a role in MERS-CoV in dromedaries and would at least explain the massive loss of cilia which appears not to be accompanied by massive cell death or other profound histological and ultrastructural alterations in the majority of affected epithelial cells. Interestingly, ciliary loss is accompanied by lack of DPP4, which serves as a cell entry receptor for MERS-CoV in dromedaries. Therefore, the authors suggest that the mild and transient disease in dromedaries is, at least in part, attributable to the downregulation of its own cell entry receptor. Further studies need to be performed to elucidate underlying mechanisms of DPP4 loss in MERS-CoV-infected CK18 positive staining cells of dromedaries. The remaining expression on adjacent MERS-CoV negative cells suggests a potential direct virus mediated mechanism.",

Moreover, infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and monocyte-derived macrophages has been described in vitro and was accompanied by release of viral particles38,39. The infection of these cell types is supposed to be mediated by DPP4, expressed on the cell surface of human macrophages38,40, and leads to suppression of the innate immunity by reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)41. In contrast, it remains so far uncertain whether the intracytoplasmic detection of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antigen in dromedary macrophages represents a true productive or abortive infection or whether it is related to phagocytosis of MERS-CoV fragments. Since the number of positive staining macrophages was very low and DPP4 was not detectable on dromedary tonsils and hardly on dromedary lymphocytes and macrophages in lymph nodes it is not unlikely that the intrahistiocytic detection of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antigen is related to phagocytosis of viral particles or infected cellular components. Nonetheless the staining of the antigen within affected cells was brightly and diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and the detection of viral antigen in phagosomes would be suspected to rather appear as discrete spots42,43. It might therefore been speculated that the viral antigen detection indeed represents virus infection of dromedary macrophages. However, further investigations have to elucidate whether it is a productive or abortive infection.",

On human T cells DPP4 is widely located on the cell surface and serves as a costimulatory molecule which contributes to T cell activation45. Contrarily, DPP4 has not been detected on the surface of dromedary lymphocytes in the tonsil and rarely on those located in lymph nodes of the upper respiratory tract in the present study. These results are in line with the lack of MERS-CoV antigen in infiltrated T and B cells within infected organs of dromedaries. In humans, abortive infection of lymphocytes induces apoptosis by activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of apoptosis and is accompanied by massive downregulation of DPP4 on the surface of infected T cells44. Similarly, a loss of the DPP4 receptor has been detected on the surface of infected epithelial cells in the present study. Taken together, obtained results suggest that the incapacity to invade T cells, alongside other factors, might contribute to the low pathogenicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries.",

Immunohistochemistry was performed for the detection of CD3+ T cells (polyclonal rabbit anti-CD3, DakoCytomation GmbH), CD20+ B cells (polyclonal rabbit anti-CD20, Thermo Fisher scientific), and CD204+ macrophages (monoclonal mouse anti-human macrophage scavenger receptor, human CD204, BioLogo) as summarized in Table 1. The used markers have been previously established for lymphoid dromedary tissue28. Additionally, epithelial cells were labeled by application of different antibodies (Table 1) directed against pan-cytokeratin (CK; monoclonal mouse anti-Human Cytokeratin, DakoCytomation GmbH), CK5/6 (monoclonal mouse anti-Cytokeratin 5/6, DakoCytomation GmbH), CK 14 (polyclonal rabbit anti-Keratin 14, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and CK18 (monoclonal mouse anti-Cytokeratin 18, Abcam). CEACAM5 was investigated using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human CEACAM5 antibody (Abcam) and DPP4 was visualized using a polyclonal goat anti-DPP4/CD26-specific antibody (R&D Systems). Briefly, after dewaxing in Roticlear\u00ae (Roth C. GmbH & Co. KG) and rehydration in isopropanol and ethanol (96%, Roth C. GmbH & Co. KG), endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation of sections in 85% ethanol with 0.5% H2O2 (VWRTM International GmbH) for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections in citrate buffer (2.1 g citric acid monohydrate in 1 l distilled water, adjusted with NaOH to pH = 6.0) for 20 min in a microwave (800 W). Subsequently, sections were transferred to Shandon CoverplatesTM (Thermo Electron GmbH) and nonspecific binding was blocked by inactivated 20% rabbit (DPP4) or goat serum (all other antibodies) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) including 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; PBS/BSA) for 30 minutes. Afterwards sections were incubated with the respective primary antibody for 90 min at RT. For appropriate negative controls, primary antibodies were replaced by ascites fluid from Balb/c mice (1:1000; CD204, pan-CK, CK5/6, CK18, mc MERS-CoV nucleocapsid), goat (1:3000; DPP4) and rabbit serum (1:3000; CD3, CD20, CK14, CEACAM5), respectively. Subsequently, the appropriate secondary biotinylated antibody was added in a dilution of 1:200 with PBS (Table 1). Incubation for 60 min at RT was followed by treatment with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC Kit Standard, VectorLaboratories) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Visualization of the reaction was achieved by the chromogen 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, 0.05%, Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH) and addition of 0.03% H2O2.

In the lymph nodes of both human and dromedary, DPP4 (red) is detected in the paracortex and medulla (arrows), but in much smaller numbers in that of dromedaries (arrow). Immunohistochemistry, 400x. In human PBMC, DPP4 is mainly expressed by CD3+ T cells and hardly expressed by CD20+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, and CD14+ monocytes (B). S1 protein of MERS-CoV is used to detect DPP4+ cells in both human and dromedary PBMC. Lymphocytes and monocytes population are differentiated based on their size and granularity. DPP4 is mainly expressed by lymphocytes in human PBMC while it is mainly expressed by monocytes in dromedary PBMC (C). Data in figure B and C are visualized as the mean percentage.",
