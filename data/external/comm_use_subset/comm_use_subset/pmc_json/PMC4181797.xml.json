Most of countries reported a lower influenza activity10,11, and some countries such as Spain, England, and Taiwan reported a shift in age distribution and severity.12\u201314",

Antibacterial agents could be prescribed but antivirals were not available. In brief, all hospitalized children who presented with cough and/or difficulty breathing, aged less than 15 year and residing in the catchment area, were enrolled. This covered all pediatric influenza cases that required hospitalization. Demographic and clinical information were collected by trained research nurses using a standardized form. Blood and nasopharyngeal swab (NSP) specimens were obtained from the participants after admission and completion of informed consent. Flexible Sterile FLOQ Swab, COPAN, Italy (#503CS01) was used for the nasopharyngeal sample collection.

The A(H1N1)pdm09 cases were older (40\u00b78 versus 27\u00b75 months, P = 0\u00b70009), and the duration for onset to hospitalization was shorter (1\u00b76 versus 3\u00b71 days, P = 0\u00b70015) compared with seasonal influenza A cases. However, the A(H1N1)pdm09 cases had lower body temperature (38\u00b74 versus 39\u00b77\u00b0C, P = 0\u00b70003), slower pulse rate (98\u00b76 versus 114\u00b72/minute, P = <0\u00b70001), and less wheeze (P = <0\u00b70001) compared with seasonal influenza cases. The percentage of radiological confirmed pneumonia (RCP) cases among the A(H1N1)pdm09 was lower than the seasonal influenza viruses (11% versus 27%, P = 0\u00b7011). There was no difference in terms of hospitalization periods between the two groups. No influenza-positive ARI cases in this study were severe enough to received intensive care or required mechanical ventilation. Among a total of 354 influ-A cases, coinfection with other respiratory viruses was identified in 84 cases (24%). Respiratory syncytial virus was the commonest followed by HRV. Interestingly, coinfection with other viruses was seen less frequently among the A(H1N1)pdm09 cases compared with seasonal influenza cases (11% versus 31%, P = 0\u00b7001).",

This may be due to the waning of the protective effect of maternal transferred antibody to the child and the changing social contact behavior in this age group. Several factors may be responsible for the difference of influenza incidence in different countries. First, influenza surveillance and detection system might be different between during and after the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in some countries. As many countries expanded the surveillance system and switched from rapid antigen test to PCR-based detection which is more sensitive, it is expected to have increased detection rates. Second, each country adopted various management programs to control the outbreak during the pandemic, including school closure, antiviral treatment, and behavior change due to pandemic awareness. They will also have effect on the outcome. Lastly, influenza seasonality is naturally different between temperate and tropical regions. In connection with that, influenza virus survival and transmissibility, host physiology, social behavior, or their combination can contribute to different epidemiological patterns.",

On June 11, 2009, the WHO declared globally the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic influenza outbreak. In Vietnam, the government informed all medical institution and the public about the situation and introduced guidelines for management. The first case of A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected in Nha Trang on July 30, 2009. At that time, the community was already aware of the situation, so this might led the parents to bring their children to the health facilities earlier.

            "text": "We were not able to genotype all influenza A-positive cases, mainly because some clinical samples contained relatively low copy numbers of influenza A virus that restricted viral RNA extraction in good quantity and quality to perform the genotyping assays. However, the number of the samples that we could not perform genotyping was only 28 after the pandemic influenza A; therefore, it is less likely to affect the main outcome of the study. A large portion of samples from 2007 and 2008 (n = 91) was not available for genotyping due to lack of samples. The study only covered the hospitalized pediatric influenza cases, so the study could not determine the potential changes among mild influenza cases treated at outpatient department or those who did not come to the study hospital in the region. In conclusion, the pandemic influenza A outbreak in 2009 did not increase the rate of pediatric ARI hospitalization and disease severity in central Vietnam. Public health intervention to promote influenza vaccine usage can reduce the burden of influenza in Vietnam.",
