The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology, including infectious agents, host and environmental factors, with particular emphasis on transport stress. The latter is indeed responsible for physiological changes that favor pathogen proliferation and invasion of tissues by opportunistic pathogens [1,2,3,4,5]. Viruses and stress-related behavior interfere with the mucociliary clearance of the respiratory tract and dysregulate the tracheal antimicrobial peptides of the innate defenses, allowing opportunistic bacteria to cause pulmonary infections [2,6]. Infectious agents of BRD include both viral and bacterial agents such as bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis.",

A total of 56 Limousine beef steers, approximately 6\u201310 months of age with an initial body weight of about 400 kg, were included in this study. They travelled for about 1600 km/28 h from an assembly point in France (Malonze, 23300 La Souterraine) to southern Italy (Gioia del Colle, Bari) in a gooseneck semitrailer with two mobile decks (first deck of 32.9 m2; second deck 29.10 m2) of the same transport company. Specifically, three different shipments, travelling on three different days one month apart from the other (February to April), transporting a consignment of about 30 animals each, were considered. More than half of the animals travelling in each shipment were included. Briefly, out of a total of 94 animals, in the first, second and third shipment (day1, day2, day3), 20/32, 15/29 and 21/33 animals were randomly tested, respectively. In France, before collection at the assembly point, animals were reared at pasture on different farms, located close to the assembly point. At the assembly point they were grouped respecting the original penning, were kept for less than 24 h, and then shipped to Italy. Before shipping, official veterinarians checked the health of the animals and those with clinical signs were not loaded. During the travel, steers received water and feed at regular intervals and no unloading stops were planned, in compliance with the EC Regulation 1/2005. Upon arrival, the animals included in the study were located separately (i.e., isolated in a different pen) to the other animals travelling together and the animals already reared at the arrival farm. During the study, the animals were fed with alfalfa barley silage mixed diets which were similar to the feed provided at the assembly point and during the journey.",

Contextually, at T1, four days after the first shipment arrived, two DNS/each were collected from two animals located in the arrival farm to evaluate the epidemiological status of the residential herd.

Although the cattle involved in this study only originated from France feedlots, constraining our findings, the study has several strengths and points of interest. BCoV and, mostly, H. somni, were detected at T0 with fair frequency, indicating that, for these pathogens, some animals were already infected before loading. This datum requires clarifications. In the dissemination of BCoV infection, stressors such as the comingling or transport of cattle play a significant role in viral replication and shedding. However, though the shedding of the virus can be very long, it does not necessarily indicate transmission potential [14,15]. In a recent study, high BCoV arrival titers were detected in groups of animals on arrival at different feedlots, but titer changes after arrival reduced BRD risk, suggesting that the positivity on arrival could be expression of healthy animals, able to mount an effective immune response, rather than evidence of BCoV-specific protection per se [16]. On balance, epidemiological evidence of BCoV-induced BRD is persuasive, although the centrality of that role remains somewhat unclear.",

In recent studies, the most frequent bacterium isolated in the lower respiratory tract of cattle with BRD was P. multocida, followed by M. haemolytica and H. somni, and the identification of these three pathogens was more frequent in cattle with BRD compared to healthy cattle [17,18]. In addition, Welsh et al. [19] observed a variation in the ratio of M. haemolytica to P. multocida isolations from beef cattle with pneumonia in about six years. In the present study, H. somni was found to be the most common bacterium identified, whereas P. multocida and M. haemolytica were more rarely detected. The latter result may be related to a change in virulence among these pathogens due to antibiotic pressure and the development of bacterial resistance [18]. However, regardless of its origin, the high prevalence of H. somni required a more in-depth control of this pathogen in feedlot cattle, and more careful attention and investigation before shipping.",

It is important to highlight that, in our study, DNS collected from the animals at the local farm were positive only for BCoV, thus the epidemiological status of the herd at arrival may be one of the reasons for the higher prevalence of this virus found in the DNS at T1. This datum supports the theory that the epidemiological status of arrival farms should be considered as a possible risk factor of BRD [4,20]. ",

Although feedlot placement did not increase BRD-associated pathogens, the relative variability of the microbiota observed following feedlot placement may explain why beef steers are most susceptible to BRD during this period.

            "text": "Our data should be considered preliminary because this study was limited by a number of factors. Firstly, due to the small number of events (three shipments, 112 samples) the logistic model was likely to suffer from small-sample bias. Secondly, the effects of other factors, such as age of the animals, driver, month, the number of farms per transport, climate conditions, space allowance and mingling were not considered, consequently, our results are valid only for the tested type of journey and animals. It is indeed well known that management conditions of the transport, distance travelled, season and geographic area of origin, are crucial elements in order to define the risk profile of developing BRD. Thirdly, the prevalence of the pathogens at the farms of origin and the number of farms per each shipment was not determined. This gap was due to the fact that the animals collected at the assembly point arrived from different local farms, and it was not possible to sample animals over there and we had no access to the documentation reporting the origin of each animal. However, sampling before loading provides a partial indication of the animal\u2019s health status. Lastly, a great limitation of the study is that it was not possible to split the effects of the stress due to transport from stress due to the adaptation to a new farm and to document how those stressors affect the immune system of the animals. It has been found that potential causes for BRD onset include stress associated with transport, adaptation to feed, the new social hierarchy, and viral exposure [1,2]. It is well known that these stressors affect respiratory immunity, response to infection, bacterial growth, viral replication and the tissue repair process, and are responsible for an increase in cortisol release and a decrease in leukocyte numbers [20,21]. Consequently, it has been suggested that, to reduce the economic cost of the disease, it may be more effective to focus on the host than the pathogens [1,22]. Unfortunately, in this pilot study it was not possible to determine stress or other immunology biomarkers, thus further studies are needed to explain other possible causes of the increase in the prevalence of BRD pathogens in the nasal microbiome of beef steers after travelling. Our results need, therefore, to be confirmed in a larger dataset, including more events and evaluating the effects of multiple factors using multivariate regression analysis to provide useful guidelines to prevent the performance losses and poor welfare associated with BRD. Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations, this preliminary study increased our knowledge of the prevalence of BRD in beef steers.",
