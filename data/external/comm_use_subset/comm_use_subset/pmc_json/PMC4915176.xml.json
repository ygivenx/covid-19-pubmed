            "text": "Black carbon, the most strongly light absorbing-component of particulate matter (PM), is an air pollutant increasingly discussed to affect both human health and climate change [1]. For Western Europe, traffic seems to be the most important source and average exposures of 6.5 ug/m3 have been described for people in transport [2]. Black carbon is mainly present in the form of soot particles within the so-called ultrafine, nanoparticle fraction of anthropogenic air pollution, but in addition to the inhalation of combustion-derived nanoparticles, the workplace can also be an important site of exposure in the case of manufacture of carbon black. Due to its small size, inhaled carbonaceous nanoparticles (CNP) have been described to effectively penetrate deep into the lungs, deposit in the fragile alveolar region and might thus be more potent to induce health effects than lager particles [3\u20135]. Even that associations of specific sub-components of PM with adverse effects are difficult to detect for epidemiological studies, combustion-derived particles had been identified as an important component in driving adverse effects of PM already years ago [6, 7]. In this context the WHO report 2012 recognizes sufficient evidence of epidemiological studies for an association of daily variations in black carbon concentrations with short\u2011term changes in health (here: all\u2011cause and cardiovascular mortality, and cardiopulmonary hospital admissions), and suggest BC to be a better indicator of harmful particulate substances from combustion sources (especially traffic) than undifferentiated PM mass. We and others have used carbon nanoparticles of various sources, such as Printex 90 or Sterling V to examine the underlying toxicological mechanisms in animal and human studies [8\u201312]. While these CNPs exhibit difficulties in the aerosolization of agglomerated black carbon powders in the ultrafine or nanosized mode (<100 nm count median diameter), freshly, lab generated CNPs have been used for inhalation studies in mice [13, 14], rats [15], and man [16, 17]. Depending on the focus of interest and also the doses applied, these studies describe low grade pulmonary inflammation, trombogenicity, cardiovascular impairments and alterations in the peripheral blood leukocyte distribution upon CNP exposure.",

According to this hypothesis the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of particle toxicity for so called low-solubility and low-toxicity particles (LSLTP) is dependent on particle triggered oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation [18, 19]. The most prominent feature for this innate immune response is the recruitment and activation of granulocytes, specifically neutrophils, to the site of stimulus, here the site of pulmonary particle deposition [20, 21]. For LSLTP such as titanium dioxide, polystyrene or carbonaceous nanoparticles (CNP), the particle induced pulmonary inflammatory effect, assessed as number of neutrophils accumulated in the airspace of the lungs, is predominantly driven by oxidative surface properties of the pulmonary deposited particle [22]. As consequence and due to their high specific surface area, nanoparticles have been shown to be more inflammogenic than fine particles of identical chemical composition [20, 23, 24].",

            "text": "However, which cell type upon particle deposition finally initiates the inflammatory cascade remains obscure. Broadly speaking the alveolar compartment, as main site of nanoparticle deposition and retention, consists of three different cell types which line the alveolar surface and are thus directly in contact with the deposited particles: type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) alveolar epithelial cells and in the epithelial lining fluid nestled alveolar macrophages (AM). Even that a \u2018three cell model\u2019 is oversimplified, and various other immune relevant cell types such as dendritic cells, mast cells, interstitial macrophages and fibroblasts will have to be considered [25], we like to start from this simplistic view and focus here at the alveolar surface, which is likely bearing the highest particle burden upon CNP inhalation. AT1 cells cover 98 % of the alveolar surface [26, 27], ATII cells secrete surfactant, maintain the fluid balance and have been described as defender of the alveolus [28]. The tissue resident AM are known for their effective uptake of deposited particles and also nanoparticles [29], and mediate acute lung inflammation and resolution in many disease conditions [30].",

            "text": "The recruitment of neutrophils to the site of injury is generally initiated by the binding of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1, -2 and -5 to the neutrophil chemokine receptor CXCR2 [20]. CXCL1 can be expressed by macrophages, neutrophils and epithelial cells during the inflammatory response [31]. CXCL2, also referred to as MIP2\u03b1 (macrophage inflammatory protein 2-alpha), in contrast is mainly secreted by monocytes and macrophages [32]. CXCL5, also known as ENA-78 (epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78), is a small cytokine and mainly expressed by epithelial cells [33, 34]. Till today no specific signaling receptor or cell type recognizing sterile particles such as CNP or other LSLTP has been described and related to the evoked inflammatory response in the lung. Even that promising studies have recently uncovered the activation of e.g. epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor [35] or pattern recognition receptors by different nanoparticles [36], it is still unclear how relevant this interaction may act as initial trigger for the inflammatory response, caused by inhaled LSLTP particles. Since our mechanistic understanding of the early phase of the cellular course of events from particle deposition to neutrophil accumulation in the alveolar airspace of CNP exposed lungs remains elusive, we might be tempted to compensate this gap by employing a well-established mode of action, such as the one known for neutrophil recruitment triggered by bacterial infection. Here pathogen-associated molecular pattern are recognized by specific pattern recognition receptors and tissue macrophages are considered crucial sensors for pathogen-invasion and cell damage. A similar macrophage based understanding exists for the pulmonary toxicity of quartz particles and fibers. Particle phagocytosis of needle like shapes or particular crystals can combined with the material specific high surface reactivity cause lysosomal destabilization, which sensed by the NALP3 inflammasome, leads to the release of the pro-inflammatory master cytokine IL-1\u03b2 from particle laden macrophages [37, 38]. In addition to that, IL-\u03b1 had been described as a alarmin cytokine, upstream of IL-1\u03b2, which is released from AM already in the first hours after silica particle deposition [39]. None of these activation mechanisms have so far been observed for pyrogen-free, spherical carbon nanoparticles, and a specific role of AM in sensing these particles as a danger pattern remains uncertain.",

In vitro, high doses of CNP have been shown to trigger, apoptosis and proliferation of ATII cells via pathways using EGF-receptor signaling [41].

Since the majority of inhaled nanoparticles are rapidly incorporated by AM, thereby posing the highest cellular dose to these cells, and since activated macrophages are in general well known for their extreme cytokine production capability, we hypothesize that alveolar macrophages play a key role for the initiation of CNP induced lung inflammation. In order to address this question, we performed a time course analysis to identify the onset of the inflammatory response, isolated AM by Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), CD45+ lung tissue leukocytes and CD45- lung epithelial cells from the CNP instilled mice and examined the expression of inflammatory genes and neutrophil chemoattractants. Much to our surprise however, a comparison of the gene expression profiles of the three isolated cell populations uncovered an essential role of the alveolar epithelium, most likely type II (ATII) cells, for the production of the neutrophil chemoattractant at the onset of CNP induced inflammation, but not for the particle laden AM. Also no activation of alveolar macrophages preceding the cellular inflammation could be detected during the first 3 to 12 h after exposure.",

As displayed in Fig. 4a, BAL concentrations of CXCL1, CXCL5 and TNF\u03b1 showed a similar release pattern, with highest levels 12 h after CNP exposure. CXCL2 exhibited a more biphasic response, with highest levels at 6 and 12 h after treatment. In contrast to BAL PMN numbers, all investigated cytokine levels had dropped to baseline already by day 3, and TNF\u03b1 concentrations were falling even below that of controls. With regard to the escalation of the BAL cytokine concentrations at 12 h after CNP, CXCL1 and CXCL5 levels actually multiplied by a factor of 30 and eight respectively, whereas TNF\u03b1 and CXCL2 levels were as compared to controls induced only less than threefold. CXCL1 and-5 reached highest absolute BAL concentrations, with 850 and 640 pg/ml respectively, suggesting these two cytokines to be of major importance for the particle exposure triggered PMN recruitment to the airspace. Moreover, a significant increase in gene expression in lung homogenates for Cxcl1,-2,-5, and to a lower extent also for Tnf was detected by quantitative RT-PCR from 6 h to 12 h after CNP instillation (Fig. 4b). Cxcl and Tnf expression levels returned to baseline by day 3.

AM were isolated from mice by BAL either 3 and 12 h after sham treatment, or 3, 6 and 12 h after CNP IT and processed for qPCR. Expression analysis of the genes related to classical pro-inflammatory macrophage activation, Nos2 (nitric oxide synthase 2, inducible), Tnf and Il1b (Fig. 5a, and Additional file 1: Figure S5A) showed no exposure related changes. Also the Cxcl genes which showed significant upregulation in lung homogenates at 12 h after CNP treatment (Fig. 4b), revealed unresponsive in BAL AMs, 3, 6 and 12 h after CNP IT (Fig. 5a, and Additional file 1: Figure S5A). Noteworthy, under control conditions Cxcl1,-2 and-5 showed higher expression levels in BAL macrophages as compared to lung tissue extracts, but 12 h after CNP, total lung expressions exceeded those of AMs by magnitudes. In addition expression of the pro-inflammatory NF-kB pathway responsive genes Nfkbia, Nfkbib, and Nfkbiz (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells inhibitor alpha,-beta,-zeta) [44] did not show any change upon particle challenge in BAL AMs (Fig. 5c and Additional file 1: Figure S5). In contrast to the CNP exposure, instillation of endotoxin (0.1 \u03bcg LPS) caused a vigorous activation of the isolated BAL macrophages 12 h after, resulting in the well-known classical activation profile (Additional file 1: Figure S5). Altogether these data support the notion that the population of BAL isolated macrophages is not activated by particle instillation and thus does not seem to contribute to the inflammatory CNP response of the lung.\n",

The latter was confirmed by the absence of any inflammatory response in experiments with different murine macrophage cell lines, known for their endotoxin sensitivity (data not shown), and most importantly also by the lack of any pro-inflammatory CNP triggered macrophage stimulation in the current study. We have further chosen intratracheal instillation (IT) as delivery, superior to the more natural route of inhalation, because of the ease of dosimetry and the definite time point of pulmonary dose deposition as a result of the bolus IT delivery. In a previous CNP inhalation study we had in this context detected a bi-phasic gene expression response, characterized by an initial stress response phase during the first 4 h of CNP inhalation, followed by the inflammatory phase in the following 20 h [13]. This response pattern may be seen as a consequence of a gradually increasing dose accumulation combined with proceeding cellular stress and activation processes.",

A distinct expression and release of neutrophil attracting CXCL chemokines, accompanied and preceded the inflammatory recruitment of PMNs, in a way that Cxcl1,-2 and-5 gene expression increased most rapidly from 6 h to 12 h after the particle challenge (Fig. 4b) and yielded highest cytokine concentrations around 12 to 18 h after treatment. The 12 h time point showed also the most prominent activation of the NF-kB1 pathway in lung homogenates, indicated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of the specific recognition sequence for NF-kB, and the maximal expression of the NF-kB responsive genes Nfkbib, and Nfkbiz (data not shown).",

The most obvious candidate for the cell type which triggers the inflammation response to pulmonary particle deposition may be seen in the alveolar macrophage (AM). We have previously shown in rats, that already after a 6 h gold nanoparticle (14 nm) inhalation, particles were found in 94 % of the BAL AMs directly after the exposure period [29]. Accordingly also in the present study, carbon black laden AM were detected in the lungs already 3 h after CNP instillation, pointing to the highest cellular dose experienced by these tissue resident phagocytes. In view of the well-described potency, and necessity of AMs to respond to pathogens and to kick-off the local defenses against infection [50\u201352], we hypothesized that the massive contact with particles would induce an inflammatory activation of these cells. In this context, Brown et al. [53] showed the activation of rat AMs in vitro, by increased intracellular calcium, AP-1 transcription factor activation and TNF\u03b1 production, all triggered by high doses of a very similar type of 14 nm CNP (Printex 90). So far however, no clear in vivo evidence was presented for the direct activation of AMs by pulmonary exposure to pure carbon particles.",

We therefore expanded our analysis to different primary cell isolates of the lung periphery from CNP and sham treated mice, to identify the cell type showing the most obvious inflammatory expression profile. From lavaged lungs we separated cells into CD45- lung epithelial cells and CD45+ lung leucocytes, and by lavage recovered BAL leucocytes. Immunohistochemical characterization revealed CD45- cells to be largely alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells (>95 %). This characterization completely agrees to previous characterizations of this way prepared lung cells [54\u201356] In fact this population showed the most robust induction of Cxcl1 and-5 gene expression 12 h after CNP exposure in relation to sham exposed lungs (Fig. 6a). The data thus suggests that ATII cells are an important source for the CXCL1 and-5 cytokine release observed 12 and 18 h after particle treatment (Fig. 4a). Noteworthy, CXCL1 and-5 were the most abundant chemokines identified, and were found to be released at concentrations of 600\u2013900 pg/ml BAL fluid. In the contrary neither CD45+ lung leukocytes, nor BAL cells showed any sign for an inflammatory stimulation and marker genes like Cxcl2, Tnf, Nos2 and IL1b remained basically unchanged at the time point of investigation (Fig. 6b). This lack of inflammatory activation of total BAL cells after 12 h matched well with that, described before for BAL macrophages 3, 6 and 12 h after treatment, and supports the conclusion that AMs do not contribute to the initiation of the inflammatory response under sterile conditions. This of course was in sharp contrast to the by bacterial endotoxin provoked inflammation, were macrophages where characterized by abundant NFkB1 activation (Additional file 1: Figure S6) and pro-inflammatory gene expression (Additional file 1: Figure S5). It should be noted at this point, that the BAL cell population analyzed for Fig. 6 contains for the 12 h post CNP IT group already a great number of granulocytes (see Fig. 3) and the expression profiles do therefore not completely match with those shown in Fig. 5 for purified alveolar macrophages (see Additional file 1: Figure S4 for details). Hence the exposure related increases in Tnf and Il1b in BAL cells are likely attributable to leukocytes not present after purification.",

Also carbon black particles had been reported to generate ROS, cause a transient increases of intracellular calcium, and subsequently lead to the expression and release of TNF\u03b1 in rat AM via activation of NF-KB and AP1 [53]. Therefore, our initial expectation was that lung macrophages contribute to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to recruit circulating neutrophils to the alveolar space. In this context, we also exposed primary AMs and cells of the murine alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S to CNP in vitro, at doses up to 100 \u03bcg/ml. In contrast to Browns finding, we could not detect any induction of TNF\u03b1 transcription or protein release. Yet exposure of MH-S cells to ambient PM2.5 effectively caused TNF expression and release, as did LPS [57]. The different outcomes for the similar carbon black particles might eventually be related to the different doses used. We however think that in vitro doses beyond 100 \u03bcg/ml medium are too excessive and likely to cause artefacts.",

In contrast to this finding for insoluble, pure carbon particles, ambient PM samples are known for their potency to trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 from exposed AMs [57], and this cytokine response is assumed to be crucial for the subsequent stimulation of the epithelium [58] or even cardiovascular effects beyond the lungs [59]. In our study CNP IT also induced highest levels of BAL IL-6 concentrations with up to 800 pg/ml 12 h after treatment, in comparison to levels below 10 pg/ml in controls, but again no exposure related change of Il6 gene expression could be detected in macrophages, neither in CD45+ nor in BAL cells at the same time point of investigation. Due to contaminations in ambient PM samples, such as airborne bacterial endotoxin or reactive metallic compounds, the described PM triggered induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine release for AMs may however differ from that driven by pure carbon particles. On a related note, the initiation of CNP triggered inflammation seems also independent from the alarmin release mechanism, recently uncovered for crystalline silica particles [39]. In their study the authors describe the release of the tissue damage alarmin IL-1\u03b1 from AM directly after pulmonary silica particle deposition. Opposed to this, no change in IL-1\u03b1 BAL-levels could be detected in the CNP instilled lungs up to 24 h after exposure (data not shown), again arguing for a different kind of trigger for pure carbon particles.",

From that view one might expect that especially pure carbon particles, characte rized by high hydrophobicity such as the here investigated CNP, should trigger such an ancient innate immune responses via the activation of respective damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptors. First in vitro evidence for this interaction could be provided by exposure of splenocytes, to gold nanoparticles of different hydrophobicity [36]. Counter-intuitively and in contrast to this appealing hypothesis however our results deny an early exposition of DAMPs on the alveolar surface, as these motives would certainly cause immediate macrophage activation which we detected for LPS (Additional file 1: Figure S5 and S6), but not CNP IT. It is possible that the lung lining fluid and the thereby generated nanoparticle corona plays a protective role.",

Besides secretion of surfactant, ATII cells have also been shown to sense invading pathogens to produce antimicrobial products and amplify the inflammatory response by secretion of cytokine and chemokines [61, 62]. Particularly for nanoparticles, the alveolar epithelial layer has been described to accomplish uptake and translocation of deposited materials [63, 64]. For agglomerated carbonaceous particles this process might however be not effective enough [65] to a detection of epithelial internalized CNP agglomerates by light microscopy (Fig. 1). The fact that particularly CXCL5, also called epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78), is a specifically from inflammatory epithelial cells released chemokine, and showed highest expression levels 12 h after CNP instillation (Fig. 4), clearly indicates an early inflammatory activation of the epithelium by particle cell interactions. Unfortunately an immunohistological in situ detection of NF-kB driven cell activation failed in our hands for CNP exposed lungs, and only approved significant AM and alveolar epithelial NF-kB activation for LPS treated mice. Nevertheless, there is good evidence for both cell types ATI and -II to express and release CXCL5 under septic stimuli [33, 66, 67], but which cell type is the major source for sterile or nanoparticle triggered inflammation has after all not yet been elucidated.",

The time-course of maximal epithelial inflammatory activation from 6 to 12 h after CNP suggests that the alveolar epithelium gets stimulated by the deposited particles only for a short period of time and then recovers to basal conditions. One reason explaining this dynamic inflammatory kinetic could be related to the rapid phagocytic particle clearance by resident AM, as no increase in the percentage of particle laden cells is observed 12 h after IT. In fact our data suggests that the pulmonary deposited CNPs can only develop their pro-inflammatory potency on the epithelium until engulfed by macrophages. From that point on the epithelial irritation can recover since CNP laden AMs do obviously not promote inflammation but rather remain inactive until eventually cleared by mucociliary removal. In vitro exposure of ATII cells to high doses carbon black nanoparticles has previously been shown to stimulate the release of macrophage chemoattractants [68], suggesting that structural cells might trigger the chemotaxis of AMs to the site of particle deposition. In this light the outdated term \u201cdust cells\u201d for alveolar macrophages highlights their specification in a way that for \u2018low\u2010solubility low\u2010toxicity particles\u2019 the essential function of AMs is limited to the removal of particles from the lining fluid to prevent epithelial irritation and inflammation, but not to trigger inflammation itself.",

As alveolar deposited particles are rapidly removed by phagocytic clearance from the respiratory surface, the epithelial inflammatory response seems short-lived as long as particle laden macrophages remain unstimulated. Yet inhaled materials which are difficult to clear by phagocytosis or pose toxicity and persistent stimulation to alveolar macrophages, may cause persistent inflammation and should therefore be designated more hazardous than \u2018low-toxicity low-solubility particles\u2019 such as carbon nanoparticles.",
