EV can be also found in the respiratory tract and some types, especially from species C and D cause upper and lower respiratory symptoms [2]. Since the first isolation in 1962 [3], Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has been associated almost exclusively with respiratory diseases. It shares similar biological characteristics with rhinoviruses, which are currently classified together with EV in the genus Enterovirus within the Picornaviridae family [4]. EV-D68 has acid sensitivity and grows at lower optimal temperatures in some cell lines than other EV [5]. Before 2014, only a few outbreaks or sporadic cases of EV-D68 infections had been reported in different parts of the world [6\u20138]. However, in the late summer of that year, a large-scale outbreak of severe respiratory illness associated with EV-D68 was noted in the United States (US) and Canada [9,10]. Moreover, there was a significant increase of cases with neurological complications after the respiratory episode, mainly acute flaccid myelitis [11].",

Additionally, cases of paralysis or severe myelitis in children, in which EV-D68 was the only etiologic agent detected, were reported in different countries, including Spain [17\u201321]. Regarding respiratory diseases, in our country most of detected EV were not usually characterized, and the first reports of EV-D68 detection were published in 2015 [22\u201324]. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were first, to identify the genotype of the EV detected in clinical samples collected from hospitalized patients with different respiratory diseases over a 5-year period, and second, to describe the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of EV-D68 infections in Spain.",

Genotyping was performed using a previously described RT-nested PCRs in 3\u2019-VP1 region for EV species A, B and C [25] and subsequent sequencing. In addition, a specific RT-nested PCR for EV-D68 detection in the same region 3`-VP1 was designed and evaluated. Primers used in this case were: outer sense, 5\u2019-CATACCTTAGRTTTGATGCTG and outer antisense, 5\u2019-CCATTGAATYCCTGGRCCTTC; inner sense, 5\u2019- GTACCMACTGGTGCTCTTAC and inner antisense, 5\u2019- CTGATTGCCARTCCACATAG. PCR reaction mix, cycling programme, and sequencing conditions were the same as previously described for species A, B and C RT\u2013PCR [25]. An EV-D68 isolate cultured in RD cells was used to validate the designed RT\u2013PCR. The virus titre was determined by the median cell culture infective dose (CCID50/ml) and calculated by the K\u00e4rber method [26]. To determine the lower limit of detection (LoD) of the assay, serial 10-fold dilutions of the virus, containing 107 CCID50/ml, were analysed. A set of 15 EV strains from species A to C and four EV-D68 isolates (obtained in 2010\u20132011 by inoculating RD cells with respiratory samples from hospitalized patients with respiratory illnesses) was analysed for testing the RT-PCR efficiency (Table 1).\n",

During 2014, however, the Enterovirus Laboratory of CNM started receiving EV-positive respiratory samples for genotyping. Our laboratory had already developed tools for genotyping EV species A, B and C but not for species D, in which serotype D68 belongs. Therefore, a specific RT\u2013PCR for EV-D68 was designed. Analysis of EV-positive specimens collected from April 2014 to December 2018 from Spanish hospitalized patients with respiratory illnesses confirmed the presence of EV-D68 in almost half of the total characterized EV. Other EV types from species A, B and C were also detected at different rates. EV-A and B are occasionally detected in respiratory samples and their involvement in the respiratory pathology is not as clear as in the case of EV-D68 and EV-C104, EV-C105 or EV-C109 [2,5\u201316,31,32]. This is in agreement with the fact that in our study, in most cases, EV-D68 was the single infectious agent. In EV-A and B infections, however, the number of co-infections with other known respiratory virus was significantly higher which could mean that in those cases, EV could be an incidental finding. Furthermore, most of the identified EV-A and B types were those predominantly circulating in Spain during the same period of time (data not published). However, as there are few reports about which EV-A or B types are presented in respiratory symptoms, further studies are necessary to confirm or not their involvement in those pathologies. Although hospitals did not refer any bacterial infection in these patients, a possible limitation of our study could be the lack of common criteria from all of them testing the samples searching for different viruses or bacteria. Therefore, some coinfection positive cases could be missing.",

In 2016 and 2018, however, it circulated almost throughout the year, with a higher incidence in spring and summer. This seasonal distribution, in which EV-D68 has periods of low circulation followed by others with high incidence, has been reported in other countries [29,30,33\u201335], and suggest epidemics of EV-D68 in 2016 and 2018, which was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of partial VP1 sequences showing increased genetic diversity. The phylogenetic tree showed that most of the Spanish EV-D68 sequences detected during 2016 clustered to the recently described lineage B3 [33], while strains from 2014 and 2015 belonged to subclade B2. Similar results have been obtained with other studies [34,35], suggesting that all the 2016 outbreaks would be originated by the emergence of the clade B3 becoming predominant and replacing previously circulating clade A and subclades B1/B2. Another hypothesis might be that EV-D68 from clade B1/B2 caused non-symptomatic infections whose detection would have been underestimated since all included samples in this study were from hospitalized patients. Furthermore, most of the EV-D68 detected between November 2017 and December 2018 belonged to a new emerged subclade D1 detected firstly in China in 2016 and in Italy and France during 2018 [28\u201330]. These findings indicate that although EV-D68 epidemics can be due to the emergence of new lineages, multiple clades have been circulating simultaneously worldwide from 2010 to the present day.",

Regardless, the recent publication of a mouse model, in which mice inoculated with EV-D68 developed symptoms of myelitis, as well as several reports evaluating the evidence for a causal relationship supported this association [36\u201339]. Indeed, the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization have recently recommended testing EV-D68 on respiratory samples in cases of AFP/AFM, both for case management and for surveillance purposes [40]. Furthermore, in the present study, EV-D68 was detected in CSF specimens from two patients with signs of meningoencephalitis, reinforcing the neurotropism of this EV. Finally, all neurological EV-D68 strains belonged to subclades B2/B3 or D1. These emerging genotypes are considered to have more neurotropic potential than A or C strains [30,36,37].",

Multiple clades of EV-D68 have circulated since 2010 in our country, although one (subclade B3) becomes prevalent in 2016 and other (D1) emerges in 2018. In addition, EV-D68 has also been associated with severe neurological cases, indicating the need for better surveillance of this EV type in respiratory specimens at national levels. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms of this recent emergence and the severe disease presentations involved.",
