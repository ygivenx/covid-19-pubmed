The marginal contribution of adding terms to a \u201csaturated\u201d model is limited, but costly. Ginsberg et al [18] only selected 45 significant keywords from 50 million. The method of exhaustion employed by Ginsberg et al [18] is computationally expensive and not easily reproducible by researchers with limited resources [27]. In some cases, researchers have solely relied on keywords recommended by Google [23], [24], [26]. Keywords recommended by search engines tend to be comprehensive, but not always relevant to the subject.

Upon entering \u201c\u6d41\u611f\u201d into the keyword tool, we obtain 94 related keywords (Table 2). Although recommended by the keyword tool, some of the 94 keywords are not related to influenza epidemics in China. We therefore filter the keywords as follows: (i) the selected keywords should represent factors that might influence the influenza epidemic. (ii) The search query data for each keyword should be represented as a sequential time series with a daily, weekly or monthly resolution. (iii) Lastly, the time series of selected keywords should have a maximum cross-correlation coefficient of at least 0.4 with the influenza case data.",

The method is comprehensive but highly subjective. Alternatively, the correlation coefficient between the influenza epidemic curve and the keyword frequency curve can be used to represent the weight [18], [33].

Although the selected keywords perform well at capturing the temporal trend of the epidemic curve, there is no guarantee that this would be consistent in future dates. Individual behavior is constantly changing and different factors influence keywords queried by individuals. Another limitation is the unavailability of Internet access in rural regions. The China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) currently estimates Internet penetration in China at 39.9%. Surveillance using web-query data depends on adequate Internet access. In addition, not all searches on influenza-related terms are necessarily linked to influenza morbidity. Search queries can be a result of panic during a novel respiratory outbreak, coverage of influenza-related deaths in the media, fear or curiosity. Using several years of data in modeling should hopefully mitigate occurrences of panic induced searches since the weight of various keywords is likely to deviate from one influenza season to another. Furthermore, correlation does not imply causation, which suggests that predictions made using such novel data sources should be carefully evaluated.",

In addition, there are likely to be major differences in timing and duration of epidemics from province to province. Analysis at the province level would therefore be more beneficial.
