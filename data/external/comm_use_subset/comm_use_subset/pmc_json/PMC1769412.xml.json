Thus, rapid and accurate recognition of inflammation in utero is critical if targeted interventions to change outcome are to be developed [8].

After the procedure, each woman was followed prospectively up to the point of delivery. The decision to recommend amniocentesis or delivery of the fetus was made by the primary clinical provider, independent of the research protocol. The Yale University Human Investigation Research Board approved the study (February 2004\u2013April 2006). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Gestational age (GA) was established based on an ultrasonographic examination prior to 20 wk in all instances.

The MR score ranges from 0 to 4, depending upon the presence or absence of each of the four protein biomarkers [14]. A categorical value of 1 is assigned if a particular peak is present and 0 if absent. A score of 3\u20134 indicates the presence of inflammation, whereas a score of 0\u20132 excludes it [14]. However, in the current investigation, we also stratified the study population based on the \u201cseverity\u201d of inflammation (MR = 0 indicates \u201cno\u201d inflammation; MR = 1\u20132 indicates \u201cminimal\u201d inflammation; and MR = 3\u20134 indicates \u201csevere\u201d inflammation). One investigator (author IAB) performed all the protein chip array readings and scored all the samples \u201cblindly,\u201d being unaware of either clinical presentation or outcome. The MR score results were not used for clinical management. The remaining AF was centrifuged at 3,000 g, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min., aliquoted for research purposes, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until IL-6 and MMP-8 levels were measured using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) [18,19].",

All neonates underwent clinical and laboratory evaluations of sepsis. Clinical indications for early-onset neonatal sepsis included lethargy, apnea, respiratory distress, hypoperfusion, and shock. Early-onset neonatal sepsis was defined as the presence of confirmed or suspected sepsis at less than 3 d after birth. Confirmed sepsis was established when either the blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive. Suspected sepsis was diagnosed in the presence of clinical suspicion of sepsis with support from other laboratory results. Early-onset neonatal sepsis was dichotomized into present (when sepsis was either confirmed or suspected) or absent, and coefficients of associations with other binary variables were calculated.

To avoid introducing spectrum bias [27], no patient or AF sample was excluded from the final analysis; a search for intra-amniotic inflammation/infection was made in each sample and a clinical decision taken independently following review of the laboratory results for each amniocentesis procedure. Test accuracy (cases correctly classified divided by total number of cases), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were measured for each assay by examining the distribution of individual AF tests on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots. Because amniocenteses were performed across a wide range of gestation periods, the times from the amniocentesis to birth for the 169 patients were normalized to reflect pregnancy prolongation after amniocentesis as previously described [28]. The percent prolongation of pregnancy was calculated by dividing the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval by the number of days gestation at amniocentesis times 100. Kaplan-Meier probability plots were generated based on the duration from amniocentesis to delivery and their differences tested with the log-rank test (GraphPad Software, http://www.graphpad.com). Continuous data were compared with the Student t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls tests (parametric) or Kruskal-Wallis on ranks followed by the Dunn tests (nonparametric) to adjust for multiple comparisons as appropriate. Comparisons between proportions were done with the Chi-square test or Chi-square test for trend (MedCalc). Two-by-two contingency tables were constructed and Chi-square analysis of independence was used to identify significant differences among test performances. The phi-coefficient of correlation (\u03a6), an index of association for binary data, was also calculated [29]. Variables (glucose, LDH, gram stain, IL-6, and MMP-8) were dichotomized based on the defined clinical thresholds. Multiple stepwise linear and logistic regression analyses were used to adjust p-values and odds ratios (ORs), respectively, for potential influences of gestational age or other parameters. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to indicate significance.",

Women with intact membranes who had \u201cminimal\u201d inflammation had significantly shorter pregnancies compared to those with \u201cno\u201d inflammation (p = 0.01).

Using ROC analysis, we now find that a WBC cutoff of greater than 38 cells/mm3 predicts an MR score of 3\u20134. Thus, the MR score is actually more precise for the identification of intra-amniotic inflammation compared to the recommended WBC cutoffs. [16]. We next tested the utility of each test to predict a positive AF culture result (Table 6). The Gram stain had the highest specificity and accuracy for prediction of a positive AF culture.

Although to date, amniocentesis to investigate PTL or PPROM has not been demonstrated to have been of any clinical benefit in terms of the outcome, direct analysis of the AF remains the most accurate and direct method to assess for the presence or absence of intra-amniotic inflammation and infection. We found that proteomic profiling of the AF has the desired test characteristics for the detection of intra-amniotic inflammation, whether or not this occurs secondarily to infection [28]. Contrary to our initial investigation, we found that the interpretation of the MR score in the real world is not binary (\u201cdisease present\u201d or \u201cdisease absent\u201d), rather it is a gradient progressing from the absence of disease to \u201cminimal\u201d and then to \u201csevere\u201d inflammation. We demonstrated that the WBC count (one of the tests used for diagnosis of intra-amniotic inflammation) fails to effectively separate groups by their risk of preterm birth until the WBC level is very high. One does not need to be an obstetrician to understand how difficult it is in our current practice to interpret the results of the clinical tests routinely ordered to rule out infection and inflammation. Not only are the results often discordant, but their subjective interpretation based on previously reported diagnostic cutoffs for intra-amniotic inflammation frequently leads to iatrogenic preterm delivery in the absence of relevant confirmatory information [20].",

For clinical relevance, we compared the diagnostic performance of the MR score against glucose, WBC count, LDH, IL-6, and MMP-8 by using the clinical laboratory cutoffs previously reported in the literature [18,19,21,22]. Due to the retrospective nature of most of the previous reports, further studies need to be done to re-evaluate prospectively the cutoffs currently used by the clinicians to best diagnose intra-amniotic inflammation and infection, histological chorioamnionitis, and early-onset neonatal sepsis. Furthermore, such new cutoffs should be compared in a prospective fashion against the MR score.",

The current results suggest that the initial phase of the intra-amniotic inflammatory response is characterized by the appearance of defensins. Recognizing that the neutrophil count does not necessarily reflect functional responsiveness [34] and that neutrophil activation is a complex sequential event, it is reasonable to suggest that the generation of a proteomic fingerprint like the MR score provides a unique tool to monitor the degree of activation.",

Currently, no clinical intervention can be recommended based on such a low WBC count. This argues for the clinical utility of performing proteomic analysis and not an AF WBC count. In addition, the results of our study seem to suggest that the MR score (one to two biomarkers present) can identify women at risk of premature delivery, when no clinical test other than proteomic profiling can do it. Thus, it is critical that at this stage, in women with \u201cminimal\u201d inflammation, we initiate as soon as possible prospective randomized trials to determine whether drugs with well-recognized anti-inflammatory properties (i.e., N-acetylcysteine) can halt the progress of diseases and prolong pregnancy [8]. Furthermore, several women with \u201csevere\u201d inflammation (an MR score 3\u20134) showed a full inflammatory response even when WBC counts were well below the currently recommended cutoffs for inflammation. This observation suggests that the concept of maternal and fetal inflammation needs revision, because the degree of neutrophil activation as reflected by the MR score may be more clinically relevant than the absolute WBC count.",

Despite this, our data indicate that the presence of biomarkers characteristic of intra-amniotic inflammation is related to the presence and the degree of acute histological inflammation at delivery.
