A 3C-like protease from the virus, 3CLpro, is required to cleave 11 sites of the polyproteins pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa) for their maturation (2). 3CLpro is a chymotrypsin-like protease, but it uses Cys as a nucleophile for catalysis (3). Analogous to 3C proteases of picornaviruses, 3CLpro has substrate specificity in cleaving the amide bond between P1-Gln and a small amino acid such as Ser, Ala, or Gly at P1\u2032 (4,5). As evident in its 3-D structure (6,7), this small P1\u2032 residue is near Thr25, which likely determines the substrate specificity.",

            "text": "It was previously demonstrated that the recombinant SARS 3CLpro can undergo auto-processing (7,8), which indicates its potential as a tag-cleavage endopeptidase. However, it would need to be capable of cleaving Q\u2193M, since Met is the most common first residue at protein N-termini. In this study, we replaced the 3CLpro Thr25 with the smaller Gly residue to expand the S1\u2032 site and found that the mutant protease cleaved peptides with larger amino acids such as Met at P1\u2032 with high efficiency. The results presented here demonstrate that Thr25 is essential to determine P1\u2032 substrate specificity and that the T25G mutant can be used as a novel endopeptidase for tag cleavage of recombinant fusion proteins in addition to the commonly used thrombin, Factor Xa (FXa), and tobacco etch virus protease (TEVpro). Moreover, we have constructed two vectors, using prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts, which contained the nucleotides encoding the T25G recognition site AVLQ\u2193M between the tags and the N-terminal Met of the target proteins. In these vectors, PstI (CTGCAG) was chosen as a 5\u2032 cloning site, since its sequence overlapped the nucleotide sequence (GCGGTGCTGCAG) encoding the protease recognition site. Identical 5\u2032-PstI/3\u2032-XhoI cloning sites in these vectors were used to allow sticky-end DNA fragments of the target genes generated by PCR (9) to ligate with these vectors simultaneously in a strategy called parallel cloning (10,11). These vectors, in conjunction with the T25G protease, provide new tools for convenient protein production in different hosts and tag cleavage to yield recombinant proteins with authentic sequences.",

The enzymatic activities of these protease forms were measured using the fluorogenic substrate Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans, as described previously (12). Compared with the activity of wild-type, no significant difference was observed for T25G and C-terminal His-tagged T25G, but T25S showed almost complete loss of activity (Figure 2A, upper panel).

Compared with TEVpro, T25G showed a 3-fold higher cleavage rate (0.106 \u00b5M/min versus 0.035 \u00b5M/min; data not shown). However, compared with that of FXa, another commonly used endopeptidase, the cleavage rate of T25G was 1.7 times lower (0.106 \u00b5M/min versus 0.178 \u00b5M/min; data not shown). TEVpro generally accepts any amino acid at P1\u2032 except Pro (16). However, besides Met, T25G prefers small residues that are actually very common N-terminal residues of \u201cnative proteins\u201d due to the post-translational action of Met amino peptidase. This suggests a great advantage of using T25G as a novel endopeptidase for tag removal. These engineered vectors and T25G can be assembled as a kit for the maximal production of soluble and functional proteins with authentic sequences.",
