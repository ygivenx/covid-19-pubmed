Initially, the CnPnV was abbreviately named for the canine pneumovirus; however, to make species names uniforms, the CnPnV was recently replaced by \u201cCPV\u201d acronym, which is established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [7]. CPV belongs to the Pneumoviridae family, genus Orthopneumovirus, which includes viruses associated with both animal and human respiratory pathogens, such as human respiratory syncytial viruses (HRSV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), murine pneumonia virus (MPV) and the recently discovered novel swine orthopneumovirus (SOV) [8]. Complete genome sequence analysis of the previously described CPV strains indicated that it was very highly related to the MPV with 95\u201396% nucleotide identity [1, 2, 9]. However, CPV has been taxonomically segregated as an unclassified virus as well as caprine pneumovirus and ovine pneumovirus [7].",

            "text": "As a Pneumoviridae, CPV contains six core genes, which are arranged as NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L [2, 10]. The non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1 and NS2, are highly unique among the pneumoviruses and are associated with pathogenicity and alteration of interferon responses in MPV and HRSV infections [11, 12]. The phosphoprotein (P) and large (L) protein are essential to form the core RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex with the N protein to make up the complete nucleocapsid [10]. The matrix (M) protein is a structural protein that enhances the association of the nucleocapsid with its membrane. For the MPV, the M2 gene acts as transcriptional regulation for RNA replication [13]. The major surface glycoproteins contain the small hydrophobic (SH) protein, attachment glycoprotein (G/glycoprotein) and the fusion (F) protein that both are essential to the pneumovirus infection [14, 15]. The G/glycoprotein targets the ciliated cells in the trachea while the F protein enhances the viral membrane fusion with the membrane of target cells for RSVs infection [15]. Furthermore, both the G/glycoprotein and F proteins are targets for neutralizing antibodies following infection of HRSV [16, 17] and BRSV [18]. Together, the G/glycoprotein and F glycoproteins are considered an important virulence factor, and have a high level of genetic and antigenic variation between related pneumovirus species, which frequently gives rise to escape mutants [19\u201323]. Therefore, both the G/glycoprotein and F genes serve as target genes for the analysis of genetic diversity of these viruses. Indeed, a previous study that focused on CPV isolation from dogs and cats in the USA attempted to define the CPV subgroup on the basis of a molecular study of both the G/glycoprotein and F genes [9].",

Recent evidence of natural recombination forcing the evolution of pneumoviruses has been documented in HRSV [25, 26], human metapneumovirus [27] and avian metapneumovirus [28], but evidence of natural genetic recombination in the CPV genome is not yet available. To complete this fragmentary data, this study provided molecular identification and characterization of the full-length genome of three Thai CPV (CPV TH) strains isolated from the airways of dogs with respiratory disease in Thailand. The determination and analysis of isolated CPVs led us to define the first identification of CPV Asian strains, which were phylogenetically distinct from the known American and European strains. Beyond this finding, we have analyzed the potential recombination events in the Asian CPVs and found that one of the three Asian CPV strains was a recombinant virus. Therefore, the information presented in this study is essential for studying the CPV diversity and evolution and gives evidence for the first emergence of CPV in Asia.",

            "text": "The CPV has recently emerged as a pathogenic virus causing respiratory problems in both sheltered and client-owned dogs in France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, UK [2, 3, 5, 6] and USA [1, 9, 10], whereas another investigation of the pathogen causing respiratory problems in Finland showed no evidence of CPV infection in the dogs with respiratory illness [4]. In this study, we identified the presence of CPV in six (2.9%) CIRDC dogs in Thailand, which is the first evidence of CPV\u2019s emergence in Asia. The CPV incidence in this study is quite lower than other reports. This finding might indicate that the CPV is not the one of common pathogens causing respiratory disease in Thai dog population; however, the present study does not reflect the true epidemiology of the CPV in Thailand. Further large-scale investigations of CPV antigen through its seroprevalence are needed to complete information of CPV prevalence. So far, the CPV-positive dogs in this study revealed severe clinical signs by showing inappetence and bronchopneumonia when examined by chest radiograph; however, the bacterial pathogens associated with the CIRDC were not screened. Thus, the clinical signs relating with CPV-positive dogs in this study need to be interpretation cautiously.",

Based on the criteria of strain classification used in previous studies [39\u201341], the CPV TH viruses could be considered as novel strains.

Here, we present the first evidence of natural genetic recombination in the CPV_CP82 TH/2016 strain and emphasize that genetic recombination plays a potential role in pneumovirus evolution. Of note, multi-strain infections are one predisposing etiology of natural genetic recombination by the interaction of potential parents in the same host [46\u201348].

In this current study, we assessed the selective pressure on the highly variable G/glycoprotein region of the CPVs and identified the codons that appeared to have been under diversifying positive selection as it has been previously found in other pneumoviruses, while most others have been under purifying negative selection, using the FEL and MEME methods, whereas the SLAC test suggested that the G/glycoprotein sequences have only been under negative selection. It is hard to estimate diversifying selection using the alignment of deduced amino acid sequences, because most selective events might be episodic and only occur in some evolutionary clades [27]. The MEME test was used to detect both episodic and pervasive positive selections to reduce the SLAC limitations, as the results indicated [38]. For the HRSVs, the diversifying positive selection sites observing in the G/glycoprotein region were reported and emphasized that these evolutions are more likely impact the host immune response [51]. As positive selection sites were found in the G/glycoprotein sequence in this study, this might imply that the G/glycoprotein of the CPV is a highly mutation region as for viral adaptation to escape the host immunity and might not be as a good target for prevention and intervention strategies. However, result in this study challenged the previous study showing that the G/glycoprotein was under negative pressure without any positive selection sites [9]. These apparently inconsistent results may have been caused by the number of tested sequences and different methods used.",
