These diseases also have an economic impact, as they lead to substantial consumption of antimicrobial agents in both community and hospital settings.

In our study, the outcome was severe for all of the children who presented malnutrition and 67% (2/3) died. Chisti et al show that the combination of pneumonia with severe or moderate malnutrition is associated with a high risk of death: the RR ranges from 2.9 to 121.2 for severe malnutrition, and from 2.5 to 15.1 for moderate malnutrition. For moderate malnutrition, RR = 1.2 to 36.5. Several other studies also lead to the same results [30]\u2013[33]. Ballard et al. report that malnutrition and level of parental education both have an impact on the incidence of respiratory infections [34].",

However, little information is available about the causes of childhood pneumonia in developing countries. In our study, only 3% of the patients died; this value is low. Note that the study population consists of patients from families with a socioeconomic level that is above the average for the general population in Madagascar. The patients who died were more frequently co-infected and under 6 months old. These results are consistent with other studies on this topic in developing countries [35], [36].
