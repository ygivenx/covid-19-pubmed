An estimated 250 million preschool-aged children are VAD, with at least 5 million showing clinical signs1. VAD is associated with increased susceptibility to disease, poor response to vaccination and increased mortality2,3. Although frank VAD is generally considered a disease of the developing world, marginal VAD can be problematic even in developed countries such as the U.S.1,4\u20136. Over 20% of the population in the developed world does not reach the recommended intake, and has plasma and liver concentrations of vitamin A lower than those accepted as normal4,5. Premature infants are born VAD, and despite supplementation, can remain biochemically deficient for months to years after birth7,8. Even at subclinical levels, VAD has been linked to increased incidence and severity of respiratory diseases4,5,9.",

            "text": "Vitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble retinoids, including retinol, retinal and retinyl esters. Animals are incapable of de novo VA synthesis; therefore, dietary VA is obtained in the diet as preformed VA from animal sources, or as provitamin carotenoids such as beta-carotene from plant sources. VA is stored in the liver, and when needed, is released into the blood stream in the form of retinol. Retinol is converted to its bioactive form, retinoic acid (RA), by a series of enzymes including alcohol dehydrogenases and retinaldehyde dehydrogenases. VA and RA play complex roles in regulating the immune system. VAD causes reduced or altered T and B cell responses to a number of pathogens10\u201315; dysregulated production of type I IFN16; and alterations in numbers and functions of innate immune populations including monocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cell subsets16,17. The roles of VA and RA have been studied in the context of immunity in the gastrointestinal tract. RA plays an important role in regulating the homing of T cells to the gut18, and in promoting the development of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells19. Less is known about the importance of VA and RA in lung immune function. Given the known epidemiologic link between VAD and respiratory disease, there is a need to define the role of VA and RA immunity in the respiratory tract.",

The BRSV-NP vaccine exhibited sustained release kinetics of antigen in vitro and maintained the immunogenicity of the antigen payload. Calves receiving a single, intranasal dose of the BRSV-NP vaccine were partially protected from BRSV challenge, with reduced viral loads in the lung, reduced virus shedding and significantly reduced lung pathology compared to their unvaccinated cohorts34. In this study, protection in calves was associated with the induction of virus-specific IgA responses in nasal secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and virus-specific cellular immune responses in the lower airways and peripheral blood34.",

VAD is endemic in the geographical regions which are hit hardest by RSV1, and is also highly prevalent in premature infants, a population known to be at increased risk from RSV7,8. Epidemiologically, there is significant correlation between VAD and increased susceptibility to and severity of RSV infection35,36; however, the impact of the deficiency on mucosal immune function has not been explored in this context experimentally. To this end, we generated a calf model of VAD, assessed the immune response to mucosal BRSV-NP vaccination and subsequent BRSV challenge, and compared the responses to VA sufficient (VAS) calves. Here, we report that while VAS, BRSV-NP immunized calves are protected from severe RSV-associated disease, VAD calves fail to respond to intranasal BRSV-NP vaccination and develop severe BRSV-associated disease. VAD, BRSV-NP immunized calves do not mount an IgA response in the respiratory tract, nor do they generate virus-specific T cell responses in the lungs or peripheral blood. Gene expression studies demonstrated that VAD calves present with significant abnormalities in the inflammatory milieu in the infected lung, with alterations in Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and impaired mucin production. We further show that acute respiratory viral infection has a significant negative impact on circulating and stored VA levels, causing even vitamin-replete calves to become VA deficient. Thus, our results show that VA status has a significant impact on the mucosal immune system and resistance to respiratory viral infection.",

Calves are born with low VA levels and colostrum is a major source of VA and other fat-soluble micronutrients37. Therefore, all calves received fractionated colostrum replacer with or without VA restored, and were placed on a VAS or VAD milk replacer diet. Serum retinol levels were evaluated weekly, starting after calves were on the differential diets for 1 week. As shown in Fig. 1A, all animals had low serum retinol levels at week 1, but these levels increased in the VAS group, reaching normal serum retinol concentrations by 5\u20136 weeks of age. The normal range for serum retinol in juvenile calves (30\u2013300 days) is 0.25\u20130.33 ppm38. Plasma VA levels are tightly regulated by the liver, and therefore not optimal for determining VA status. To confirm VA status in our two treatment groups, liver samples were collected at the time of necropsy. The normal range for liver retinol in juvenile calves is 75\u2013130 ppm38. As seen in Fig. 1B, calves in the VAD treatment group had below normal retinol stores in the liver at the time of necropsy, while VAS calves had normal liver stores.",

To determine the impact of VAD on the response to intranasal vaccination, 13 calves from the VAS treatment group and 12 calves from the VAD treatment group were immunized with the BRSV-NP vaccine. In prior studies, inclusion of soluble antigen with CPTEG:CPH NP-encapsulated protein has been used to induce rapid immunogenicity of the nanovaccines29,39. Therefore, in this study we also sought to determine whether inclusion of soluble F/G protein improves the efficacy of the BRSV-NP vaccine. Calves were immunized intranasally with a single dose of 145 mg BRSV-F/G NP (encapsulating ~1 mg each of the BRSV F and G proteins), co-administered with 1 mg each of soluble F and G proteins in 5 mL of sterile saline. Six VAS calves and six VAD calves served as unvaccinated controls. Four weeks after immunization, calves were challenged via aerosol inoculation with ~104 TCID50 BRSV strain 375. Calves were monitored daily for clinical signs, including body temperature, appetite, nasal discharge and respiratory effort. Starting on days 4\u20135 after infection, animals developed fevers and clinical signs of lower respiratory tract disease, including coughing, increased respiration rates and increased respiratory effort. As seen in Fig. 2A, on day 7 post infection, clinical disease was significantly reduced in VAS/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves compared to VAS/unvaccinated animals and compared to VAD/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves. There were no significant differences in the clinical signs observed between VAS/unvaccinated controls, VAD/unvaccinated controls and VAD/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves.",

VAS/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves did not mount a significant IgA response to BRSV or the F and G proteins in the nasal fluid prior to BRSV challenge; a result that is consistent with our previous studies.

In contrast to their VAS cohorts, the VAD/BRSV NP vaccinated animals failed to mount a vaccine-induced IgA response in the BAL or nasal fluid (Fig. 4). In ruminants, IgG1 is produced at significant quantities at the mucosal surface; therefore, we also analyzed BRSV-specific IgG (all isotypes) in nasal fluid and BAL fluid on day 7 after infection (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similar to our IgA results, VAS/BRSV NP vaccinated animals had increased levels of virus-specific IgG in the BAL fluid, while reduced quantities of virus-specific IgG were observed in the nasal secretions of unvaccinated animals (both VAS and VAD) and VAD/BRSV NP vaccinated animals.

However, similar to the IgA results, we did not detect a vaccine-induced cellular response in either the airways or peripheral blood prior to BRSV challenge.",

In a mouse model of pneumovirus infection, VAD animals present with a \u2018hyper-inflammatory\u2019 phenotype in the lungs, with elevated expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines41,42. To investigate the impact of VAD on BRSV infection, lung tissues samples were collected from unvaccinated, BRSV infected VAS and VAD calves on day 7 after infection and analyzed by qPCR for expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. As seen in Fig. 6, the expression of IFN\u03b3, IL-6, IL-13, CXCL9, CXCL10 and TGF-\u03b2 was significantly higher in the lungs of VAD animals compared to VAS controls. In contrast, the expression of IL-17 and the mucin gene, MUC5B, were both significantly reduced in VAD animals compared to VAS calves. The expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-22, IL-8, and IL-10 were not significantly different between VAD and VAS animals.

In rodents challenged with endotoxin, retinol is transiently sequestered in the liver and other tissues, but reappears in the plasma shortly after, with no appreciable irreversible retinol loss44. In human patients, however, acute illness has been linked to increased VA deficiency43. Observationally, respiratory infections in particular have been implicated in depletion of liver VA stores in children45; however, to our knowledge, there have been no studies to date investigating the impact of RSV infection on VA levels in nutritionally-replete infants. Given the potential link between acute infection and VA status, we more closely examined retinol levels in the VAS animals undergoing acute viral infection. Serum samples were collected from VAS/BRSV-NP vaccinated and VAS/unvaccinated calves on days 0, 2, 4 and 6 post infection and were analyzed for serum retinol. As seen in Fig. 7, consistent with reports of hyporetinemia in other species, serum VA levels declined in VAS/unvaccinated calves during acute BRSV infection. In contrast, VA levels were maintained in VAS/BRSV-NP immunized calves, which were undergoing a significantly reduced clinical disease (Fig. 2A). When liver VA levels from VAS calves (Fig. 1B) were further analyzed based on vaccination status, we observed that unvaccinated calves had reduced liver VA levels compared to the vaccinated cohort (Fig. 7B). In fact, the mean liver retinol levels fell below the accepted normal range for animals of this age38, rendering them VA deficient, despite their VA replete diet. We also analyzed liver retinol data from all VAS calves based on BRSV-associated lung pathology scores. As seen in Fig. 7C, liver retinol concentrations were negatively correlated with lung pathology (as an indicator of disease pathology). Thus, acute RSV infection has a significant negative impact on both circulating and stored retinol levels, even in vitamin-replete individuals.",

RSV infection is most severe in premature infants, neonates and young children; and complications from RSV infection are most prevalent in developing countries21,23. VAD is endemic in the geographical regions which are hit hardest by RSV1, and is also a significant problem in premature infants in both developing and developed countries7,8. Also concerning, while VAD is thought to be a disease of the developing world, some studies have suggested that subclinical VAD may be quite prevalent1,4,5,46. It is critical to identify and address comorbidities and host factors which have potential to undermine the effectiveness of a vaccine, such as VAD, in target populations. Here, in the calf model of BRSV infection, we show that VAD has a profound negative impact on the capacity of the host to respond to an intranasal, polyanhydride NP vaccine and to resist the subsequent viral challenge. VAD calves have altered inflammatory cytokine profiles in the lungs, and do not produce virus-specific IgA or cellular immune responses in the lungs or peripheral blood. VA and RA play defined roles in gut immune function and homeostasis; however, our results emphasize that VA also plays an important role in immune function in the respiratory tract.",

            "text": "VAD calves demonstrated a heightened inflammatory cytokine profile in the lungs during BRSV infection, with increased expression of IFN\u03b3, IL-13, IL-6 and the IFN\u03b3-inducible chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. This result is consistent with a previous report by Penkert et al. in a mouse model of Sendai virus (SeV) infection41, where levels of IL-6, CXCL10, IFN\u03b3 and RANTES were increased in nasal washes from VAD, infected animals. In this model, similar to ours, VAD mice fail to produce virus-specific IgA and have reduced frequencies of CD8 T cells in the lungs following infection42. RA promotes the development of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, while inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation47. The dysregulated hyper-inflammatory phenotype that has been observed in some models of VAD has been attributed to deficiencies in FoxP3+ Treg cells48. However, Penkert et al. showed that there is no defect in Treg cell differentiation in SeV-infected mice41. Given the reciprocal relationship between Treg and Th17 cells in the presence of RA47, one would predict increased Th17 development and increased IL-17 expression in a VAD system, thus explaining the altered inflammatory profile. However, this is not consistent with our findings in the lungs of VAD calves, as we observed significantly reduced expression of IL-17. Similarly, IL-17 was not detected in the nasal washes of VAD animals during SeV infection41. In a report by Cha et al., VAD mice have significantly reduced expression of IL-17 and reduced numbers of Th17 cells in the lamina propria49. Rudraraju et al. attributed the altered inflammatory profile in the lungs of SeV infected mice to increased viral antigen and viral persistence in the respiratory tract. When animals are sacrificed at the peak of the infection (day 7), the authors observe no difference in the viral titers between VAS and VAD animals42; however, on day 10 after infection, VAS animals had significantly reduced viral loads compared to VAD animals41. The authors speculate that antigen persistence and defects in viral clearance mechanisms contribute to the heightened inflammation in the lungs of the VAD animals, rather than defects in Tregs or Th17 skewing. We detected no differences in virus shedding or viral load between VAD or VAS calves on day 7 after infection. In future studies, it will be important to determine if VAD calves display similar defects in viral clearance in the later stages of the disease, thus explaining the dysregulated cytokine production we observed in the lungs, or if instead, this defect may be attributed to other mechanisms during RSV infection such as an imbalance in the Treg/Th17 axis. Importantly, we observed no significant differences in IL-10 expression in the lungs of VAD calves compared to VAS controls, suggesting that the Treg response may be intact in these animals. However, we did observe increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 in the lungs of our VAD calves. While TGF-\u03b2 expression can play a regulatory role, it is also an important cytokine that is elevated during during tissue repair and can contribute to lung fibrosis and mucin expression50. Further investigation into the impact of VAD on the respiratory immune system and response to RSV infection is warranted.",

Measles, chickenpox, respiratory infections and diarrhea have all been implicated in the depletion of liver VA stores and increased risk of xerophthalmia, the principal clinical manifestation of VA deficiency45,51. However, there have been relatively few studies that have specifically addressed the impact of acute respiratory viral infection on retinol status in vitamin replete individuals. As we observed, serum retinol declines over the course of a severe BRSV infection. This result is not surprising, as serum VA is regulated during the acute phase response. In VA-adequate rats, serum retinol declines rapidly following LPS or IL-6 challenge, but returns to normal levels during the resolution phase of the response44,52. There is a minimal loss of retinol through the urine, and studies of radiolabeled retinol have revealed that the majority of retinol is redistributed in the liver and tissues during infection and returns to circulation53. However, contrary to these reports and consistent with the epidemiologic data from humans, our own data suggests that acute infection causes an overall loss in liver stores. In our studies, it is not clear if retinol stores are consumed during the inflammatory response or excreted during the illness. However, the severe impact of acute viral infection on VA stores is cause for concern, as there is potential to fall into a \u2018vicious circle\u2019 of acute illness, deficiency and susceptibility to secondary infection.",

VA supplementation has a significant positive impact on incidence of measles54\u201356. However, its effects on other diseases are less clear. Some studies have reported significant reductions, while others have found little effect or even increased incidence and severity of diarrhea and respiratory infections in children receiving vitamin A supplementation36,57\u201360. Studies specifically examining the impact of oral VA supplementation during RSV infection have shown no effect36,57,61 or in one study, have observed increased length of hospital stay for infants receiving VA58. We speculate that oral supplementation at the time of vaccination may not be ideal for addressing VAD and its effects on the respiratory immune response, primarily due to kinetics. A similar principle applies to supplementation during acute infection. Changes in VA homeostasis due to acute inflammation likely limits VA access to inflamed tissues and prevents any modulation to the ongoing immune response. Thus, in the future, we are interested in investigating the utility of a mucosal VA supplementation strategy, which may be a more efficient approach to addressing the immunologic lesions observed in VAD individuals during respiratory vaccination or infection.",

Therefore, in the current study, we hypothesized that administration of soluble F and G protein in suspension with the NP encapsulated proteins, would enhance efficacy. When comparing the vaccine-induced immune responses, viral burden and lung pathology from this study to our prior results34, we observed no increase in immunogenicity or protection mediated by this modified approach. This result is consistent with other recent reports from our groups, wherein a free protein component was not required for polyanhydride nanovaccine efficacy in a mouse model of influenza A virus32 or Streptococcus pneumoniae62 infection.

Calves were randomly assigned to the VAD or VAS treatment group. All calves were prevented suckling from their dams, and instead received a first feeding of colostrum replacer within 4 h of birth. Each animal received 375 g of fractionated colostrum replacer (Milk Products, Chilton, WI) reconstituted in 1.9 L of water at approximately 40 \u00b0C. The colostrum replacer contained 150 g of bovine globulin protein concentrated from colostral whey and was essentially devoid of all fat-soluble vitamins A, D3, and E. Vitamins D3 (150,000 IU of cholecalciferol/dose) and E (1,500 IU alpha-tocopheral/dose) were added back to the colostrum replacer for all calves. VA (150,000 IU retinyl palmitate) was added back to the VAS treatment group. VA was omitted from the colostrum replacer for the VAD calves.
