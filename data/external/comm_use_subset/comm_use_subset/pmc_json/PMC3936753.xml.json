A common characteristic shared by reoviruses as well as many other dsRNA viruses is that their inner capsid contains several copies of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) and mRNA-capping enzymes, and the process of reoviral positive-strand (+) RNA (mRNA) transcription from minus-strand (\u2212) RNA, followed by mRNA capping, takes place within the reoviral inner capsid (1,2). The nascently synthesized and capped (+)RNA is then released into the cytoplasm of infected cells for protein translation. After that, reoviral (+)RNAs are encapsidated into newly assembled inner capsids, and are used by RdRPs as templates to synthesize genomic dsRNA segments within reoviral inner capsids (1,3,4). Thus, unlike most single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, reoviruses use their inner capsids as the machinery for viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis and the shield for evading host antiviral defenses (1,2,4).",

And the CPV particles are embedded in polyhedra for surviving unfavorable external environment (6). Unlike other multishelled reoviruses, cypovirus is the simplest genus of the family Reoviridae because it has only a single-layered capsid (7), and this characteristic makes it an ideal and simplified model for studying the mRNA/dsRNA synthesis and mRNA-capping mechanisms of reoviruses and probably other dsRNA viruses (8). For this reason, extensive molecular and structural studies have focused on CPVs in recent years (8\u201312). However, our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the segmented dsRNA genome replication of CPVs and other reoviruses is still limited.",

VP1 is the shell protein that forms the CPV capsid shell; VP3 is the mRNA-capping enzyme; and VP5 serves as the clamp protein to enhance the stability of the CPV capsid shell (10,12). In addition, one cypoviral RdRP, VP2, is located at the inner surface of the CPV capsid shell at each 5-fold axis (3,7). Moreover, Cheng and colleagues recently found that during cypoviral mRNA transcription, both VP1 and VP3 undergo conformational changes, resulting in an enlarged capsid chamber and a wider channel in the capsid for mRNA transport and capping (8). For VP5, no structural change has been detected (8), and it was not known whether VP5 contains any activity other than stabilizing capsid shell.",

Moreover, the interactions (also termed \u2018cyclization\u2019) between the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-termini of vRNAs have been recognized as an important prelude for efficient vRNA replication of many (+)RNA viruses like flaviviruses, (\u2212)RNA viruses like hantaviruses and dsRNA viruses like reoviruses (16\u201318). For reoviruses, the 5\u2032-3\u2032 cyclization of reoviral (+)RNA forms a panhandle-like structure (19,20). This 5\u2032-3\u2032 panhandle is required for efficient dsRNA replication, probably by allowing reoviral RdRP to recognize the 3\u2032-terminal of the (+)RNA template to initiate (\u2212)RNA synthesis (18). On the other hand, like other 5\u2032-3\u2032 cyclized vRNAs (21), the panhandle should be disrupted when RNA replication proceeds on the cyclized template (18).",

            "text": "The formation and dissociation of RNA tertiary structures should be highly regulated for RNAs to function properly in various processes. However, correct folding or unfolding of RNAs is always challenging, since it is believed that RNAs would be easily trapped in local intermediate structures that are thermodynamically stable (15,22). In response, cells or viruses encode various RNA remodeling proteins, generally including adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA helicases and ATP-independent RNA chaperones, which are proposed to help overcome the thermodynamic barriers of kinetically trapped RNA molecules. RNA helicases are thought to be involved in most ATP-dependent structural rearrangements of RNAs (23). On the other hand, RNA chaperones are a heterogeneous group of proteins that are able to destabilize or unwind RNA helices and accelerate the formation of correctly folded RNA structures by helping misfolded RNAs escape kinetic traps. For the viruses having vRNA cyclization, both hantavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein and flavivirus core (capsid) protein are RNA chaperones, and hantavirus N has also been reported to unwind the 5\u2032-3\u2032 panhandle structure in vitro (21). However, no capsid protein of CPVs or other reoviruses has been found to be an RNA chaperone.",

Thus far, the RNA genome of HaCPV-5 has been completely sequenced (24,25). HaCPV-5 RNA segment 8 contains a single open reading frame that encodes a 44-kDa protein, and further sequence and structural analysis using bioinformatic tools has revealed that this 44-kDa protein is the VP5 capsid protein (11,12,26). In this study, we expressed HaCPV-5 VP5 in a eukaryotic expression system and determined that this CPV VP5 possesses an RNA chaperone-like activity to ATP-independently destabilize RNA helices and accelerate strand annealing. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent metallic ions, such as Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+ or Zn2+, to various degrees. Moreover, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 could facilitate the transcription initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a CPV panhandle-structured RNA template, thereby strongly suggesting a direct role of the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 in the initiation of cypoviral dsRNA replication.",

To further compare this protein with other CPV VP5 proteins, we modeled its 3D structure by submitting its amino acid sequence to the HMMSTR/Rosetta server (26) and found that its modeled structure is highly similar to that of BmCPV-1 VP5 (Figure 1D), which has been solved and extensively studied (33).

Because many capsid proteins of RNA viruses have RNA binding activity (21,34,35), we sought to determine whether VP5 could also bind to RNA. To this end, a gel mobility shift assay with a HEX-labeled 24-nt ssRNA (RNA1) was conducted. MBP-VP5 did bind to RNA1 (Figure 2A, lane 3), showing that VP5 has ssRNA binding activity. Moreover, to determine whether VP5 also has dsRNA binding activity, we constructed the RNA helix by annealing HEX-labeled RNA1 with a nonlabeled RNA (RNA2) that is complementary to RNA1 and found that VP5 efficiently shifted the RNA helix (Figure 2A, lane 6). After determining that MBP-VP5 can bind to both ssRNA and dsRNA, it is intriguing for us to examine whether this protein has a higher affinity for ssRNA or for dsRNA. To this end, RNA probe competition assays were performed. Briefly, 0.1 pmol HEX-labeled ssRNA probe and 2 pmol MBP-VP5 were incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled ssRNA (RNA10) or dsRNA (RNA10/RNA2). As shown in Figure 2B, only the ssRNA competitor efficiently competed with HEX-labeled RNA1, while dsRNA had a minimal competing effect, indicating that MBP-VP5 has a higher affinity for ssRNA.\n",

The RNA binding data were then quantified, and a Hill transformation was applied to determine whether the binding of MBP-VP5 to ssRNA is cooperative [a >1 Hill coefficient indicates positive cooperativity (36,37)]. As shown in Figure 2D, MBP-VP5 at low concentrations (0.05\u20130.16 \u03bcM) had a Hill coefficient value of \u223c1.499, whereas high protein concentrations (0.2\u20130.48 \u03bcM) had a higher Hill coefficient value of \u223c4.972. These results indicate that VP5 binds to ssRNA in a cooperative manner. Taken together, these results show that HaCPV-5 VP5 has both ssRNA and dsRNA binding capacity, has higher affinity for ssRNA and binds ssRNA in a cooperative manner. Besides, we also examined if MBP-VP5 can bind to DNA, and our results showed that this protein also has ssDNA and dsDNA binding activities (Supplementary Figure S1).",

The HEX-labeled RNA strand was released from the RNA helix substrate in the presence of MBP-VP5 (Figure 4A, lane 4), whereas the RNA helix was stable when MBP alone was added to the reaction mixture (lane 3). The boiled helix substrates were used as the positive controls for helix destabilization in this (lane 1) and the subsequent assays.

For this purpose, two 42-nt complementary RNA strands that form defined stem-loop structures were used (Figure 9A), and one strand was 5\u2032 HEX labeled (Figure 9A, right). HEX-labeled (0.1 pmol) and nonlabeled (0.1 pmol) strands were mixed and incubated with MBP alone or MBP-VP5 in the standard destabilizing mixture, and then the hybridization of the two complementary strands was measured via gel electrophoresis (Figure 9B\u2013D). In the presence of MBP alone, little spontaneous hybridization was detected according to increased reaction time (Figure 9B, lanes 3\u20138), whereas the presence of 10 pmol VP5 promoted the hybridization of the two RNA strands (Figure 9C, lanes 3\u20138). Moreover, when we increased the amounts of MBP-VP5 to 40 pmol, a more dramatic stimulation of the RNA strand annealing was observed (Figure 9D, lanes 3\u20138). These data show that VP5 contains the helix-destabilizing activity that can unwind RNA secondary structures and stimulate the formation of more stable RNA hybrids.\n",

Gel electrophoresis was conducted to detect the annealing of the two complementary RNA strands.

Our results showed that the destabilizing activity was optimal at 0 mM for Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Figure 11B and C), and the increase of Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentrations from 0 to 20 mM led to a gradual decrease in the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-VP5. Interestingly, this observation also excludes the possibility that the inhibitory effect of higher ATP concentrations (>0.25 mM) on VP5-mediated helix destabilization (Figure 8) was due to the chelation of Mg2+, which could be caused by adding large quantities of ATP or other NTPs (32,41), since lower Mg2+ concentrations actually enhance helix destabilization.",

Since the destabilization of the 5\u2032-3\u2032 panhandle structure of CPV (+)RNA should occur before or when the (\u2212)RNA synthesis proceeds on the cyclized (+)RNA template (18), it is plausible that VP5 functions to unwind the reoviral 5\u2032-3\u2032 panhandle to allow replication initiation at the accessible 3\u2032-end by an RdRP. To assess this possibility, we adapted a canonical assay, which was developed by Panganiban and colleagues for assessing the ability of hantavirus N protein to facilitate RNA replication initiation through the hantaviral panhandle structure (21), for VP5. We used this assay to determine whether VP5 can enhance in vitro primer-dependent replication initiation by an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through the cypoviral panhandle structure. To this end, a structured RNA mimicking the cypoviral panhandle structure was constructed using 36 nt from the 5\u2032-end and 30 nt from the 3\u2032-end of HaCPV-5 RNA segment 8, and then used as the template for RT (Figure 12A, upper panel). Moreover, because RT reactions normally involve thermal cycles at 68\u00b0C to denature and anneal the RNA template with a primer, the RT reactions were carried out at 25\u00b0C in the presence or absence of MBP-VP5 to assess the potential role of the VP5\u2019s RNA chaperone activity to unwind panhandle structure of the RNA template. Here, DIG-labeled dUTP was supplemented into the reaction mixture for visualizing the RT products. As shown in Figure 12B, the presence of VP5 dramatically stimulated the synthesis of RT products (lane 2), as did the thermal annealing treatment at 68\u00b0C (lane 1); on the other hand, the reaction product was barely detectable in the absence of VP5 (Figure 12B, lanes 3 and 4).\n",

Moreover, the structural homologs of CPV VP5 are commonly present in the inner capsids of other turreted reoviruses, including orthoreovirus \u03c32 and aquareovirus VP6, which also function as molecular clamps to stabilize inner capsids (12,33,42).

The difference between VP5 and NSP2 implies that these two proteins may not use the same mechanism to destabilize RNA helices.

            "text": "During the RNA replication of reoviruses, (+)-vRNAs (mRNAs) are encapsidated into the nascently assembled inner capsids and are then used by reoviral RdRPs as replication templates to synthesize genomic dsRNA segments within the inner capsids (1,2,4). As seen with (\u2212)-vRNA of hantavirus, reoviral (+)-vRNA can be cyclized, and its 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends undergo base pairing to form a panhandle-like structure (49). Previous studies revealed that the panhandle structure of cyclized reoviral (+)-vRNA is required for efficient dsRNA synthesis probably by recruiting RdRPs to the 3\u2032-end of the (+)-vRNA template (18). Moreover, like other 5\u2032-3\u2032 cyclized vRNAs, before or when RNA replication initiates, the vRNA panhandle structure should be dissociated to make the 3\u2032-end of the template accessible by RdRPs (18). Considering that hantavirus N, a nucleocapsid protein and RNA chaperone, can efficiently unwind the 5\u2032-3\u2032 panhandle of cyclized hantaviral (\u2212)-vRNA and subsequently promote transcription/replication initiation (21,50), we propose that the RNA chaperone activity of CPV VP5 is directly involved in the initiation of CPV dsRNA replication by destabilizing cypoviral panhandle structure in a similar manner. In accordance with this speculation, we found that when an RNA structure mimicking the cypoviral panhandle was used as a template, HaCPV-5 VP5 effectively promoted primer-dependent transcription initiation by an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) (Figure 12).",

            "text": "As a heterogeneous group of proteins that share no consensus sequences or motifs, RNA or nucleic acid chaperones are poorly understood in regard to the mechanism(s) governing their ATP-independent helix-destabilizing and annealing stimulation activities. To explain the RNA chaperone activities, an \u2018entropy transfer\u2019 model has been proposed. According to this model, RNA chaperones contain intrinsically disordered (unstructured), highly flexible regions that can transfer their disorder or entropy to misfolded RNA molecules on binding to RNA. Such an entropy transfer can destabilize kinetically trapped misfolded RNA molecules, leading to the rearrangement of RNA folding in an ATP-independent manner (13,14). So far, many virus-encoded RNA chaperones, including HIV-1 NC, Vif and Tat, hantavirus N, flavivirus core, coronavirus N and tombusvirus p33, have been predicted to contain intrinsically disordered regions (14,51). However, since the regions responsible for chaperoning activities have not been accurately mapped in many RNA chaperones, the relationship between intrinsic disorder and RNA chaperone activities is difficult to formally determine (43,52). Furthermore, alternative models, such as transient ionic or electrostatic interactions, have also been proposed to explain the RNA chaperone activity (22). Our disorder prediction of CPV VP5 using PONDR VL-XT (51,53,54) indicates that VP5 proteins from three different types of cypoviruses\u2014CPV-5, CPV-1 and CPV-18\u2014contain similar distribution patterns of potentially disordered regions (data not shown), thereby suggesting that the \u2018entropy transfer\u2019 applies to HaCPV-5 VP5, and VP5 proteins of other CPVs may also contain RNA chaperone activity.",

In this study, we found that a CPV capsid clamp protein VP5 possesses a novel RNA chaperone activity, which is thought to be directly involved in the initiation of CPV dsRNA replication. These findings show that CPV capsid proteins not only include RNA polymerase and mRNA capping enzyme, but also RNA chaperone that is important for vRNA replication and/or translation. This study should extend our understanding of RNA replication of CPV, Reoviridae and dsRNA Viridae, and also enrich our knowledge about virus-encoded RNA chaperones. Furthermore, since the (+)-vRNA cyclization and panhandle structures commonly exist in the family Reoviridae, encoding an RNA chaperone or other RNA remodeling protein, like helicase, might be a common strategy for all reoviruses. Future studies by our group and others should reveal whether rotavirus NSP2, the clamp proteins of other turreted reoviruses, as well as other reoviral structural or nonstructural proteins can also function in 5\u2032-3\u2032 panhandle unwinding and RNA replication initiation.",
