            "text": "The family Polyomaviridae contains small encapsidated DNA viruses with a closed circular DNA genome of ~5 kb, packaged within an icosahedral capsid structure. The regulatory proteins, large T and small T antigens, are encoded in the early region of the genome, and structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 are encoded in the late region [1]. Human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) usually cause asymptomatic primary infections, and persist in the body throughout life [2]. Thirteen HPyVs have been identified and successively isolated from urine (BKPyV), brain tissue (JCPyV), respiratory secretions (KIPyV and WUPyV), skin (MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, and TSPyV), serum (HPyV9), stool samples (HPyV10 and isolates MW and MX, STLPyV), liver tissue (HPyV12), and vascular endothelial cells (NJPyV). The detection of HPyVs in these tissues suggests there exists an unrecognized tropism for HPyV [3]. HPyV10 is the type species of the genus Deltapolyomavirus in the family Polyomaviridae. In 2012, human polyomavirus 10 (HPyV10), MW polyomavirus (MWPyV), and MX polyomavirus (MXPyV) were isolated from condylomas on the buttocks of patients, fecal specimens from healthy children, and stool samples from children suffering diarrhea, respectively [4\u20136]. The whole-genome sequences of MXPyV, MWPyV, and HPyV10 are nearly identical, indicating that they are variants of the same species, which suggests that HPyV10 is a fecal contaminant rather than a wart-causing skin virus [7]. HPyV10 has not yet been definitively linked to a particular human disease [8]. Very little is known about MWPyV, so it is important to investigate its prevalence, basic epidemiology, genomic variability, and possible pathogenicity.",

Different chemistries are commercially available for qPCR, including SYBR Green, TaqMan, Scorpion, and Molecular Beacons, but TaqMan is most frequently used because it can discriminate sequences that differ by only one nucleotide [9]. In a previous study, we demonstrated the specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility of a TaqMan-based real-time qPCR for detecting HPyV6 [10]. Therefore, in this study, we used real-time qPCR and DNA sequencing to investigate the presence of MWPyV in fecal samples from 174 children with diarrhea, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples from 887 children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs), and sera from 200 healthy adults in China.",

The primers and probe used for this assay were 5\u2032-GGAGACCCCACTTTAACTAGAC-3\u2032 (forward primer), 5\u2032-ACTTGGCATATCTGTTACTGGG-3\u2032 (reverse primer), and 5\u2032-FAM-ATATGGATTTGCGTTGCTGCCCG-TAMRA-3\u2032 (TaqMan probe, where FAM is TAMRA). The resulting amplicon was 72 bp in length. The qPCR was performed in a total volume of 20 \u03bcl containing 10 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Takara, Japan), 1.8 \u03bcl of each primer (10 pmol/\u03bcl), 0.2 \u03bcl of probe (10 pmol/\u03bcl), 4.2 \u03bcl of diethyl-pyrocarbonate-treated water, and 2 \u03bcl of pMD18-T/VP1 plasmid (plasmid pMD18-T linked to the 72-bp target sequence). The samples were tested in a 96-well-plate format, with sterile water as the negative control.

Serial 10-fold dilutions of pMD18-VP1 were prepared, with the standard plasmid serially diluted from 1010 to 100 copies/\u03bcl. The dilutions were added to the real-time qPCR reactions, and analyzed in triplicate. The results were used to construct a standard curve. The specificity of the qPCR was assessed by also testing WUPyV, KIPyV, JCPyV, BKPyV, and HPyV7. Reproducibility was evaluated by adding 105\u2013108 copies/\u03bcl pMD18-T/VP1 to each reaction, and performing all the reactions four times, with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal control.",

The clinical symptoms of MWPyV-positive children with ARIs included fever (n = 12, 92.3%), which was the commonest symptom, cough (n = 10, 76.9%), vomiting (n = 2, 15.4%), and convulsion, tonsil hypertrophy, and gasping (n = 1, 7.7%).

The genome copy number was 4168.69 copies/\u03bcl in one child with both bronchopneumonia and rotaviral enteritis, which was much higher than the 26.92 copies/\u03bcl NPA in children suffering bronchopneumonia and other diseases (P < 0.05, Mann\u2013Whitney U test). The clinical symptoms of all three MWPyV-positive children with diarrhea included diarrhea and fever (100%).

In this study, we used a qPCR assay to rapidly and accurately screen for MWPyV in NPA, serum, and fecal samples collected from different populations in China. Thirteen (1.47%) of the samples from children with ARIs and three (1.72%) from children with diarrhea were positive for MWPyV, whereas no serum (n = 200) was positive for MWPyV. In brief, the analysis of 1261 clinical samples only detected MWPyV in respiratory and fecal specimens from children, suggesting that the establishment of the primary infection occurs at an early age, and that the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts are sites of viral persistence. This indicates a possible fecal\u2013oral route of transmission during early childhood.",

In a study by Rockett et al., MWPyV was the most prevalent polyomavirus (56%) detected in respiratory specimens from children with ARI. These findings are supported by other studies that frequently detected MWPyV in respiratory samples from acutely ill patients and babies with upper respiratory symptoms [13, 17]. Possible explanations for these discrepancies may be the use of different detection assays, differently defined cut-off values, different geographic regions examined, and the varying characteristics of the study populations.",

These discrepancies are probably attributable to the different periods at which the samples were collected and the different detection methods used. The detection of MWPyV in the feces of children with diarrhea indicated that MWPyV may not be a strong candidate for gastroenteritis in children because of the co-infection with rotavirus.. WUPyV, KIPyV, SV40, BKV, JCV, MXPyV, and MCV have also been detected in human feces [6, 18\u201321], although their primary sites of pathology are elsewhere in the human body.",

However, in contrast to our findings, the seroprevalence of MWPyV in adulthood was 42% in a large sample from Italy [22], 66% in a sample from Colorado [14], 84% in 1614 serum samples from the Czech Republic [23], and almost 100% in samples from New Hampshire, USA [24]. These contrasting data may be attributable to the relatively small number of blood samples we analyzed (n = 200) or a different MWPyV may have been isolated from the human samples, to which have affected the antibody binding during serological analysis. Moreover, MWPyV DNA is more likely to be detected in blood during the primary infection than during viral reactivation [25]. In a study by Nicol et al., MWPyV was cleared or the virus was not reactivated with age [22], as has been reported for TSPyV [26], which may also explain why we detected no MWPyV-positive sera.",

In this study, 14 of the 16 MWPyV-positive patients were co-infected with other viruses, and four of these had multiple infections. The primers and probes used in this study are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 [28\u201330]. Influenza A virus and HCoV were the respiratory viruses most frequently detected in the MWPyV-positive patients, which is consistent with their frequent detection with WUPyV and KIPyV in respiratory samples [31]. The detection rate of Influenza A virus was 69.2%, followed by HCo-OC43, and then PIV3, the predominant subtype among PIVs. A comparison of the clinical symptoms experienced by the patients with and without co-infections indicated that co-infection with MWPyV did not affect the severity of the illness. 11 MWPyV-positive children with ARIs were diagnosed with bronchopneumonia, and their commonest symptoms were fever and cough. The symptoms of the three MWPyV-positive children with diarrhea who were co-infected with Rotavirus included diarrhea and fever. Our data suggest that primary MWPyV infections occur in childhood, predominantly sporadically. However, it is possible that MWPyV is shed within both the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Understanding these factors will help us prevent the transmission of MWPyV infections. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the epidemiological and clinical profiles of MWPyV in children hospitalized with ARIs or diarrhea in China, based on a real-time qPCR specific for MWPyV.",
