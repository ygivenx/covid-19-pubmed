            "text": "Johne\u2019s disease (JD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants with granulomatous lesions that is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) (Whitlock et al., 1996). Johne\u2019s disease can be divided into four stages depending on the clinical signs and MAP shedding levels including the silent, subclinical, clinical, and advanced clinical stage [1]. In the silent stage, the infected animals do not show any clinical sign or excrete MAP into the environment [2]. During the subclinical stage, animals still do not have clinical symptoms; however, they shed low numbers of MAP into environment, which can be circulated in the herd and infect other animals [2]. After subclinical stage, animals enter clinical stage and start to show clinical signs such as gradual weight loss, diarrhea, and decreased milk production [2]. Finally, animals become cachectic and lethargic in advanced clinical stage [2]. Accordingly, it is very important to remove animals in the subclinical stage to control the disease. However, current diagnostic methods are insufficient for diagnosis of subclinical stages of disease [3]. Although fecal culture has been considered a gold standard for the diagnosis of MAP [4], this method is time-consuming and shows low sensitivity, especially in subclinical stages of the disease [5, 6]. PCR allows rapid detection of MAP in clinical samples such as feces, milk and blood [7]; however, PCR-based methods are also limited in their usefulness for diagnosis of subclinical stages of disease because of the low sensitivity [8] and low specificity caused by genetic similarities with other mycobacteria [9, 10]. Although ELISA has been used for detection of antibodies to MAP in clinical samples such as serum and milk, this method is also inadequate for diagnosis of fecal shedders in the subclinical stage, especially in 1\u20132 year old cattle [11]. Therefore, new diagnostic tools have been requested to detect MAP-infected animals at early stage of infection.",

            "text": "Biomarkers, which are considered indicators of specific pathogenic conditions or therapeutic responses to treatment [12], are commonly used as diagnostic tools for various diseases [13\u201316]. Recently, host biomarkers discovered using transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics have been proposed as alternative diagnostic methods for paratuberculosis [17\u201320]. Biomarkers indicating early stages of MAP-infection were proposed by analyzing gene expression profiles of blood in cattle with experimental MAP infection [17, 18]. A metabolic profiling in cattle with experimental infection of MAP revealed that four metabolites (iso-butyrate, branched chain amino acids, leucine, and isoleucine) were increased in serum of the MAP-infected cattle while citrate was decreased [19]. Moreover, six proteins (transferrin, gelsolin isoforms \u03b1 & \u03b2, complement subcomponent C1r, complement component C3, amine oxidase-copper containing 3, and coagulation factor II) were proposed as biomarkers after they were found to increase by at least 2-fold in MAP-infected cattle, as were two proteins (coagulation factor XIII-B polypeptide, and fibrinogen \u03b3 chain and its precursor) that were reduced by nearly two-fold in MAP-infected cattle [20]. Our previous studies also proposed several biomarkers that were up-regulated in MAP infected macrophages, mice, and cattle [21\u201323]. Transcriptional profiles of MAP-infected macrophage RAW 264.7 cells and a mouse model suggested five and three genes as prognostic biomarkers, respectively [21, 22]. \u03b2-defensins were also suggested as prognostic biomarkers in subclinical animals of MAP-naturally infected cattle [23]. However, application of those biomarkers for diagnosis of JD has yet to be investigated. Therefore, we developed a real-time PCR method using the biomarkers for diagnosis of bovine paratuberculosis by measuring the gene expression level of several biomarkers in whole blood.",

Three genes (Hp, Serpine1, and Tfrc) showed good discriminatory ability (AUC\u22650.8) in fecal PCR-positive and/or serum ELISA-positive groups (PN, NP, PP). Acute phase proteins are blood proteins that respond to infection and inflammation and have been used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in veterinary medicine [32]. Hp is the major acute phase protein of cattle that responds to infection [33, 34]. Moreover, Hp is known to exert anti-inflammatory activity by down-regulating neutrophil activity via inhibition of both lipoxygenase and cycloxygenase [35] and to inhibit bacterial growth by interfering with iron acquisition by the host cell [36]. Moreover, Hp inhibits phagocytosis and intracellular killing of pathogens [37]. This anti-inflammatory response induced by Hp might reduce the harmful aspects of inflammation that could be destructive to the host itself. In that regard, up-regulation of Hp in MAP-infected animals might be a host response to early infection of MAP. Hp showed highest diagnostic accuracy for the NP group and whole infected animals, with AUC values of 0.942 and 0.901, respectively.",

Serpine1 also acts as an inflammatory mediator by increasing the level of interferon gamma in blood to eliminate the pathogen in the early phase of an infectious disease [40, 41]. Therefore, increasing gene expression levels of Serpine1 might be related to interferon gamma release due to MAP infection. In addition, expression of MAP0403 in MAP was increased in infected macrophages and MAC-T cells in recent study [42]. MAP0403 is kind of serine protease which served as a key element of the stress response network in intraphagosomal survival of MAP [42]. Up-regulation of Serpine1 might be a counter response to intraphagosomal survival of MAP in host cells.

Our data showed that the response of eight biomarkers (Hp, Timp1, Mmp9, Serpine1, Tfrc, S100a8, Defb1, and Defb10) significantly discriminated MAP-infected and non-infected animals. Moreover, eight biomarkers (Hp, Timp1, Mmp9, Serpine1, Tfrc, S100a8, Defb1, and Defb10) showed good accuracy (AUC\u22650.7) for diagnosis of subclinical animals. Additionally, four genes (Timp1, S100a8, Defb1, and Defb10) showed sensitivity over 80% and specificity over 90%. It is generally very difficult to detect subclinical stages of JD using currently available diagnostic methods such as bacterial culture, fecal PCR and serum ELISA [3]. Fecal PCR is a reliable method for diagnosis of MAP infection; however, intermittent shedding of MAP into feces because of immunological changes during the progress of disease can interfere with accurate diagnosis [55]. Moreover, although serum ELISA is a simple, fast and cost-effective method for diagnosis of JD, it is known to have low sensitivity for MAP-infected animals that do not show clinical signs [56]. However, our real-time PCR method based on biomarkers showed relatively precise diagnostic results. In that regard, combination of eight biomarker genes (Hp, Timp1, Mmp9, Serpine1, Tfrc, S100a8, Defb1, and Defb10) might be used for diagnosis of JD, including in subclinical stage animals.",
