The most common infectious agent responsible for respiratory infection in pigs are: swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae [6,7]. These pathogens may act together to increase the severity and duration of the disease. In pigs, as well as in humans, bacterial pneumonia secondary to influenza is often observed [8] and SIV is an important contributor to the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). The bacterial pathogens associated with PRDC are classified as primary or secondary pathogens, and Pm plays a key role as a secondary invader [9]. Up to now the kinetics of acute phase response after experimental infection of pigs with SIV or Pm alone have been investigated [3,4,10,11]. Exposure to multiple pathogens may result in different kinetics of APP response, as compare to monoinfection with SIV or Pm.",

            "text": "Swine influenza is generally characterized by acute onset of fever and respiratory symptoms [12]. The most frequent complications of influenza are secondary bacterial pneumonia. Pasteurella multocida is believed as a major bacterial agent that complicates swine influenza virus infections, and still remains the most common respiratory bacterium isolated in cases of PRDC [9,13]. Pasteurella multocida is considered to be an opportunistic invader that could be cleared from the lungs of normal pigs [13], but SIV-induced damage to the respiratory tract (loss of cilia, extrusion of mucus, exudation, necrosis and metaplasia of airway epithelium) reduced ability to clear the infection [13,14]. Previous study conducted on turkey revealed that in birds infected with avian influenza virus (AIV), the numbers of Pm in their respiratory tracts increased to a greater extent than in birds which had not been infected with the AIV [15].",

As it have been found by Barb\u00e9 et al. [11], during SIV infection IL-6 concentration in piglets\u2019 serum peaked from 24 to 30 h post infection. At later time-points post infection, the concentration of this cytokine was either >20-fold lower or at the limit of detection. The serum levels of other cytokines stimulating production of APP by hepatocytes (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1) were under the limit of detection. Rapid disappearance of IL-6 from serum could also explain a fast drop in APP concentrations during to the preinoculation levels in only SIV infected piglets [4]. Studies conducted on mice reveled that after Pm infection concentration of cytokines involved in regulation of APP production by hepatocytes increased at later time-points post infection [22]. The concentration of IL-6 peaked at 36 h post Pm infection of mice and remained elevated for the longer period of time (at least to 96 h post infection) [22].",

It should be mentioned that the timing of sampling must be taken into consideration as it may be critical in showing a precise correlation, as was reported previously by Francisco et al. [10]. Moreover, we found positive relationships between maximal concentration of Hp and SAA in serum and lung scores. The significant positive correlation found between maximum concentrations of SAA in serum and lung scores were also reported previously in pigs infected with H1N2 swine influenza virus [16]. Similarly, positive correlation between Hp and SAA concentration in pigs\u2019 serum at the day of necropsy and changes in the lungs were reported after Pm infection [3].

The highest concentrations of all investigated APP were observed from 2 to 3 dpi, before specific antibodies in serum were present. Exposure to multiple pathogens resulted in the strongest CRP, Hp and SAA response as compared to mono-infection with SIV or Pm [3,4]. Additional studies need to be done in order to confirm these findings with regard to other coinfections. Present result also confirm our previous findings that SAA could be a potentially useful indicator in experimental infection studies (e.g. vaccine efficiency investigations) or as a marker for disease severity, because of correlation observed between its concentration in serum and disease severity (lung scores, clinical scores).",
