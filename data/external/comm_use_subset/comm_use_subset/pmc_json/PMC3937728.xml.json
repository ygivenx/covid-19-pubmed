Clays are a primary nonorganic component of soils and aquatic sediments, therefore the dynamic interactions between clay minerals and phage are expected to affect soil\u2013bacteria activity (Ostle and Holt 1979; Vettori et al. 1999; Weinbauer and Rassoulzadegan 2004; Syngouna and Chrysikopoulos 2010). Montmorillonite (MMT) is a highly reactive, expandable, hydrous aluminum smectite clay. Smectite platelets are positively charged at the edges and negatively charged along the faces to produce an overall negative charge at pH > 3. Clays readily form colloidal suspensions that have the potential to interact with dispersed viral particles which influences the aggregate structure.",

Numerous studies on the interaction between viruses and clays have yielded conflicting information regarding the effect of clay minerals on virus survival and infectivity; see Jin and Flury (2002) or Kimura et al. (2008) for reviews. The contradictory findings in the literature imply that virus morphology plays a role in the interaction with clays. To our knowledge, published studies on the interactions between clays and viruses have only investigated nonenveloped viruses, although a number of pathogenic viruses found in the environment are enveloped (e.g., avian influenza, coronavirus). Enveloped viruses differ from nonenveloped viruses in that they possess a lipid\u2013protein layer surrounding the nucleocapsid (NC). Cystoviridae, a bacteriophage family that infects the plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, is one of the few phage families with an external lipid envelope. Cystoviridae species are often used as a model for enveloped animal and human pathogens (Mindich 1988, 2004).",

Roper and Marshall (1974) found that at low salinity, MMT particles surrounded Escherichia coli bacteria resulting in greater protection from phage than under higher salinity conditions. Roper and Marshall (1978) determined that MMT inhibited infection of E. coli and that finer suspended clay particles provided the E. coli with greater protection from phage by forming a barrier around the bacteria. However, they found that particles greater than 0.6 \u03bcm in diameter offered no protection. Lipson and Stotzky (1984) observed that several proteins (lysozyme, chymotrypsin, and ovalbumin) reduced the adsorption of reoviruses to MMT, likely a result of the proteins competing for adsorption sites on the clay. In contrast, kaolinite and MMT enhanced \u03c6X174 infection of E. coli (Lipson and Alsmadi 1989). Zeph et al. (1988) determined that MMT protected phage P1 from inactivation, although the presence of MMT had no effect on transduction of E. coli. Vettori et al. (2000) found that clay minerals protect phage PBS1 from inactivation and loss of ability to transduce Bacillus subtilis by UV light.",

            "text": "Animal pathogenic viruses similarly interact with clays. Vilker et al. (1983a,1983b) investigated the interaction of poliovirus with nonaggregated MMT, and through scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis determined that the negatively charged virions adhere to the positively charged MMT edges. They also suggested that clay aggregation accompanies adsorption of poliovirus and that the MMT enhances poliovirus survival (Vilker et al. 1983a,1983b). Lipson and Stotzky (1983, 1986) showed that viruses (e.g., poliovirus, coxsackie virus, reovirus) are adsorbed onto clays with enhanced survivability. The adsorption of reovirus onto MMT or kaolinite was almost immediate and correlated with the cation exchange capacity of the clays (Lipson and Stotzky 1983). This indicates that reovirus adsorbs onto negatively charged regions of the clays. Lipson and Stotzky (1985) found that coliphage T1 and reovirus type 3 adsorb onto different sites on kaolinite and MMT. They also investigated mixtures of kaolinite and reovirus and determined that these were more infectious than equivalent concentrations of virus alone and attributed the increased infectivity to improved viral transport in the presence of kaolinite.",

Although the literature has focused on the effect of environmental conditions (clay type, clay charge distribution [Lipson and Stotzky 1985; Christian et al. 2006; Templeton et al. 2008], pH [Zhuang and Jin 2008; Walshe et al. 2010], ionic strength [Tong et al. 2012], buffer composition [Zhuang and Jin 2008; Gutierrez et al. 2010], and cation exchange capacity [Lipson and Stotzky 1983; Vettori et al. 1999]), the surface morphology of viruses has been largely ignored. The attachment of phages T1, T7, T2, PBS1, or \u03c6X174 to cation exchanged clay is related to positively charged sites on clay edges (Schiffenbauer and Stotzky 1982; Chattopadhyay and Puls 1999; Vettori et al. 2000). However, Lipson and Stotzky (1983) found that reovirus adsorption occurs at negatively charged sites on cation exchanged kaolinite and MMT, consistent with Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (DLVO) (Derjaguin and Landau 1941; Verwey and Overbeek 1948) theory of colloidal aggregation. Rossi and Aragno (1999) found that colloidal aggregation of phage T7 and MMT results in reversible binding and protection from inactivation. Phages MS2 and \u03c6X174 attach to kaolinite and MMT by hydrophobic interactions (Chrysikopoulos and Syngouna 2012). Chattopadhyay and Puls (2000) studied the different forces involved in phage (T2, MS2, \u03c6X174) sorption on soil particles (hectorite, kaolinite, and Norman clay) and found that van der Waals attraction dominated over electrostatic repulsion.",

The \u03c66 virion has a layered structure consisting of an inner NC surrounded by the lipid envelope (Kenney et al. 1992). The \u03c66 bacteriophage host cell, P. syringae LM2333 growth medium is Luria Bertani, supplemented with ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/mL) to inhibit contamination. Buffers A and ACN were used for the suspensions of purified \u03c66. Buffer A contains 10 mmol/L KH2PO4 (pH 7.5) and 1 mmol/L MgSO4. Buffer ACN is buffer A with the addition of 200 mmol/L NaCl and 0.5 mmol/L CaCl2. Plate lysates of \u03c66 were prepared by plating phage dilutions into soft agar with a culture of LM2333. The plates were incubated overnight at room temperature prior to collecting the phage-containing top agar. The cell debris and agar were removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall GSA rotor (Thermo Scientific, Asheville, NC) at 15,000 rpm (3.0 \u00d7 104g) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C.

The bacteriophage samples were then layered on a 10\u201330% sucrose gradient in buffer A. Sedimentation centrifugation was at 23,000 rpm (6.7 \u00d7 104g) for 1 h at 15\u00b0C using a Beckman SW 40 Ti rotor, after which the virus particle band was visualized by light scattering and the band collected by needle puncture, pelleted by centrifugation at 33,000 rpm (7.5 \u00d7 104g) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C, and resuspended in 1 mL of buffer A.

NC-MMT mixtures were prepared in the same manner (500 \u03bcL of MMT, 100 \u03bcL of NCs in ACN buffer and Tris). The concentration of cations in the buffer was sufficient to initiate fast aggregation of MMT (Katz et al. 2013). Visual inspection confirmed that the mixture aggregated in less than a few minutes. \u03c66 in ACN buffer with Tris, but without MMT was used as a control. The Eppendorf tubes were incubated at room temperature (25\u00b0C) for an hour. The mixtures were then centrifuged for 10 min at 3600 rpm (1200g). The supernatant was collected and the clay pellet resuspended in 100 \u03bcL ACN buffer. The pelleted aggregates were vortexed prior to plaquing to disaggregate the mixture and separate the viruses from the MMT. The supernatants and final, disaggregated, clay suspensions were spot checked on plates with growing P. syringae to determine fractionation of virus in the system. Virus concentrations were calculated using the plaque assay technique. The NC populations used in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were made from comparable \u03c66 concentrations. Phage infectivity was measured over a range of 6 orders of magnitude of MMT-to-phage ratios (mg of MMT/number of virions).",

TEM grids were prepared using \u03c66 concentrations of 1011 virions mL\u22121 and MMT concentration of 1.7 mg mL\u22121. Electron micrographs were acquired at the New York Structural Biology Center with either a Jeol 2100 (Jeol Inc., Peabody, MA) or a Tecnai FEI 20 (FEI, Hillsborough, OR) electron microscope, both operating at 200 kV. For the Jeol 2100, micrographs were acquired at magnifications of 30,000\u00d7 or 50,000\u00d7 giving pixel sizes of 0.511 or 0.306 nm/pixel, respectively, on the 2k \u00d7 2k CCD. For the Tecnai F20, micrographs were acquired at magnifications of 29,000\u00d7 or 50,000\u00d7 giving pixel sizes of 0.592 or 0.340 nm/pixel, respectively, after 2 \u00d7 2 binning of the 4k \u00d7 4k CCD. Isolated \u03c66 virions and NCs are nearly spherical in shape and when negatively stained will appear in electron micrographs as \u02dc70 nm and \u02dc57 nm circles, respectively. \u03c66 virions have a clearly defined envelope that appears as a lower density region under negative staining. The NC outer icosahedral shell also appears as a brighter region in the micrographs when negatively stained. Classification of intact \u03c66 virions and MMT-induced, enveloped-stripped NCs (MMT-NC) was determined by size and shape analysis. Particles exhibiting nearly circular shape in the micrographs with a diameter between 68 nm and 75 nm were classified as nondistorted \u03c66. Nearly circular particles with diameters between 55 and 63 nm diameters were classified as nondistorted MMT-NCs. Virions deviating from circularity were classified as complete but distorted \u03c66 if the larger diameter was greater than 68 nm, or distorted MMT-NCs if the larger diameter was less than 63 nm.",

A preponderance of edge-attached and face-attached virions exhibits extensive distortion in shape, in contrast to the uniformity of particles shown in Figure 1A and B. The presence of smaller (\u02dc60-nm-diameter) particles in the micrographs is interpreted as clear evidence of disassembled envelopes leaving only NCs. Approximately third of the \u03c66 in the micrographs are completely stripped of their envelopes and are morphologically similar in size to distorted NC particles.

The increased contact suggests that the positively charged edge of the MMT is electrostatically interacting with the negatively charged virus. Two such virions are seen in the TEM micrograph shown in Figure 5A. A tracing of the outer boundary and the internal MMT-NC of virions labeled #1 and #2 are presented in the respective insets, B and C, respectively. Virion #1 has a shorter axis normal to the platelet edge (71 nm), which corresponds to the diameter of an undistorted virion. However, the elongated axis stretches to 92 nm resulting in an aspect ratio of 1.3. In contrast to virions interlayered with platelets (Fig. 4), where the distortion may be due to either expansion in two or three dimensions, the departure from sphericity noted here includes a volume increase. The boundary layer that includes the envelope (bright border) between MMT-NC and the outer surface of the virion is of variable thickness, as much as 17 nm, compared to the 6 nm envelope thickness reported by Kenney et al. (1992), suggesting that water is infiltrating the virion. Virion #2, while not appreciably different in size than an undistorted virion, deviates significantly from a spherical form. The envelope of virion #2 at the platelet edge also appeared to have undergone disassembly. The thicker region between the envelope and MMT-NC at the upper part of #2 may have resulted primarily from distortion or water absorption between the envelope and NC. The MMT-NC in virion #2 departs dramatically from a spheroidal geometry.",

The morphology of the NC particles in NC-MMT aggregates (TEM micrograph in Fig. 6.) appears similar to that of detergent-isolated NC particles. This is in distinct contrast to the MMT-NC particles produced by MMT-induced envelope disassembly. In the present case, the NC particles are roughly circular with a 57 nm diameter, that is, nearly identical in appearance to detergent-isolated NC particles. As the detergent-isolated NC particles in the aggregates retain their original morphology, the interaction with the clay is likely weaker than that between the MMT and the partially disassembled virions. This is consistent with the hydrophobic interactions reported for nonenveloped viruses (Chattopadhyay and Puls 1999, 2000; Chrysikopoulos and Syngouna 2012). It also suggests that Triton X100, which is nonionic, is less likely to produce negatively charged NCs in contrast to envelope-stripped MMT-NC particles produced by interaction with MMT.",

An SDS-PAGE gel showing the larger molecular-weight \u03c66 proteins (P1, P2, P3, and P4) (Gottlieb et al. 1988) of \u03c66 and NCs is presented in Figure 7. Lane 1 is from purified \u03c66. Lane 2 is from the extracted pellet and lane 3 is from the supernatant of the \u03c66\u2013MMT mixture. Virus concentration in the mixture was equal to that of purified \u03c66 in lane 1. Band intensities and migration positions in the pellet lane are comparable to those in the pure \u03c66 lane, whereas the \u03c66 proteins are almost entirely absent from the supernatant lane. This demonstrates that: (1) almost all the viral components remain sequestered in the MMT; and (2) the viral proteins are not being hydrolyzed by the MMT but remain intact. Lane 4 is from purified NC isolated by detergent. Effectiveness of NC isolation is confirmed by the absence of the P3 envelope protein band. Lane 5 is from the extracted pellet and lane 6 is from the supernatant of a mixture of MMT and detergent-isolated NC, also at an NC concentration equal to that used in lane 4. The comparable band intensities in lanes 5 and 6, in conjunction with the absence of NC protein bands in lane 6, demonstrate that the NC is also almost totally sequestered in the MMT aggregate without noticeable hydrolysis of viral proteins. These results are similar to those found for the whole-virus\u2013MMT mixture. The absence of P3 in the NC lanes verifies that the NC preparation did not contain whole virus.",

In other words, more than 99.99% of the virions are in the pellet. This is in agreement with the TEM and SDS-PAGE analysis. Figure 8 plots the reduction in \u03c66 infectivity relative to a virus control (no MMT) for a range of ratios of MMT to \u03c66. For the 0.2 \u03bcm MMT fraction used in these experiments, a MMT platelet has a mass of \u02dc10 fg, yielding about \u02dc1011 platelets mg\u22121. At virus concentrations exceeding the number of platelets, moderate loss of infectivity (20\u201395%) was observed. At virus concentrations lower than the number of platelets, infectivity is reduced by a factor of 10\u22121.5\u201310\u22125, where the least amount of loss of infectivity corresponded to smaller amounts of clay and the larger degree of loss corresponded to larger amounts of clay. The variation in infectivity loss at comparable platelet and virion populations (10\u22129\u201310\u221211 mg of MMT per virion) may be due to aggregation dynamics affecting the probability of virion\u2013clay contact. This loss of infectivity resulted from either the partial disassembly or complete removal of the envelope. Since essentially all the \u03c66 aggregates with the MMT independently of virion concentration, the differences in infectivity under different relative concentration can be directly attributed to the probability of direct contact between virions and platelets. At relatively lower \u03c66 concentration, the probability that virions are in direct contact with platelets increases, resulting in greater envelope disassembly. However, at higher \u03c66 concentrations, many of the virions are more likely to only be in direct contact with other virions rather than platelets and thus less likely to experience envelope disassembly.",

The extensive shape distortion exhibited by the edge-bound \u03c66 virions indicates that the forces are stronger than those binding the face-attached virions. This observation suggests that an electrostatic interaction is involved. The sandwiched virions are likely held preferentially by van der Waals forces to the negatively charged platelet faces as prescribed by DLVO theory. Both binding mechanisms contribute to the disassembly and swelling of virions and indicate that the envelope is pliable.
