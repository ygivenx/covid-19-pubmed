Worldwide, approximately 80,000 cases of NPC are reported each year, 0.7% of all cancers [1]. In general, the 5-year survival rate of NPC is 60%. When treatment begins at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate can reach 80\u201395%; however, it is poor at a later stage of NPC [2]. Radiotherapy is the primary and effective treatment for NPC. The combination of radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is another pivotal treatment for NPC patients and increases the survival rate significantly [3,4,5]. Although the therapeutic efficiency of NPC management has largely been improved, how to avoid NPC metastasis is still an urgent unmet need. ",

            "text": "Genetic, environmental, and viral factors have been incriminated in the etiology of NPC and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is strongly associated with the occurrence of NPC. EBV is a member of the gamma herpesviruses, with a 172 kb double-stranded DNA genome. The life cycle of EBV includes latency and lytic replication. Eleven gene products, EBNAs 1~6, LMPs 1, 2A, and 2B, and small RNAs EBER 1 and 2, are expressed during latent infection [6]. Upon induction by chemicals or stress, EBV is activated and enters the lytic cycle, known as reactivation. Three subsets of lytic genes, immediate-early, early, and late genes, are expressed sequentially and, subsequently, viral particles are packaged and released [7,8]. Through years of study, EBV latent infection has been considered to play an important role in NPC carcinogenesis. In recent years, accumulating evidence has suggested that EBV lytic infection also contributes to the tumorigenesis of NPC. Sero-epidemiological surveys indicate that patients with elevated antibody titers against EBV lytic proteins, such as viral capsid antigen (VCA), DNase, DNA polymerase, and early antigen (EA), have a high risk of NPC [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. Several EBV lytic products have been detected in the NPC biopsies [16,17,18]. In addition, EBV lytic proteins, including BARF1, BHRF1, BRLF1, BALF3, BGLF4, and DNase, have been shown to have various tumorigenic functions [16,19,20,21,22]. In our previous study, we found that EBV reactivated by chemicals promotes cellular genome instability and tumor growth [23,24]. Collectively, these reports suggest that inhibition of EBV reactivation might be useful for NPC prevention and therapy.",

Emodin has various medical applications, including anti-cancer, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation or allergy, anti-diabetes, and anti-viral or bacterial activities [28]. For its anti-viral effect, emodin has the ability to inhibit the SARS coronavirus [29], and block the replication of HBV [30], Coxsackievirus [31], zika virus [32], and influenza A virus [33]. Moreover, emodin has been suggested to inhibit the replication of herpesviruses [34,35,36]. However, the detailed mechanism is not well elucidated. In this study, based on our screening, we show that emodin inhibits EBV reactivation in epithelial cells, through the mechanism of repressing SP1 expression to inhibit the Zta and Rta promoter activities. Moreover, through its anti-EBV activity, NPC tumorigenesis could be relieved, suggesting emodin is a potential agent for therapy of EBV-associated cancer.",

Before investigating the anti-EBV effect of emodin, two EBV-positive NPC cell lines, NA and HA, and their parental cells TW01 and HONE-1, were assessed for susceptibility to the cytotoxicity of emodin. The cells were seeded into 96-well plates 24 h prior to treatment; then, emodin was added for 48 h to determine its cytotoxic effect on the NPC cell lines NA and HA. Emodin has significant toxicity to TW01 cells, while the derivative NA cells showed little resistance to the compound (Figure 1b). A similar effect was seen on HONE-1 and HA cells (Figure 1b). Furthermore, to evaluate these results more precisely, half maximum of cytotoxicity concentrations 50 (CC50) were calculated and are shown in the top panels of Figure 1b. The CC50 values of TW01 and the derivative NA cell lines were 31 and 79 \u03bcM, while the values for HONE-1 and HA were 58 and 65 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 1b), implying that the cells harboring EBV seemed to be more resistant to emodin (TW01 vs. NA: p < 0.01; HONE1 vs. HA: p = 0.06). Based on these results, we chose 1 to 50 \u03bcM of emodin as our working concentrations for further studies.",

To access whether emodin exerts its anti-EBV activity through interfering with IE gene promoters, a luciferase reporting assay was performed to detect promoter activities (Zp and Rp, respectively) in the presence or absence of emodin. Both EBV-positive (NA) and -negative (TW01) NPC cells were used in this study. As shown in Figure 5a,b, while TPA+SB significantly increased Zp and Rp activities in both NA and TW01 cells, addition of emodin decreased both promoter activities in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, promoter activities detected in NA cells are higher than in TW01 cells because the EBV harboring in NA cells creates an autocrine regulation to amplify the Zp and Rp activities under simulation. Next, in addition to TPA + SB, we asked whether emodin also inhibits Zta or Rta mediated EBV reactivation. To this end, Zta- or Rta-expressing plasmids were co-transfected with Zp or Rp reporter plasmids, respectively, followed by emodin treatment for 24 h. As expected, ectopic Zta activated both Zp and Rp, whereas co-treatment of emodin significantly reduced both promoter activities in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5c,d). Similarly, over-expression of Rta resulted in Zp and Rp activation; addition of emodin reversed this phenomenon (Figure 5e,f). Thus, these results suggest that emodin is able to inhibit both chemical and Zta/Rta-induced EBV lytic reactivation via repressing IE gene promoter activation.",

To this end, luciferase-reporting plasmids driven by a series of 5\u2019-deletion mutants of Zp were constructed. These mutants were respectively transfected into TW01 cells, followed by aforementioned compound treatment and luciferase-reporting assay. As depicted in Figure 6a, compared to wild type, promoter Zp-99 retained only half of the activity; promoters shorter than this region (Zp-80, Zp-51) gradually lose their responsiveness to TPA+SB. Notably, the inhibition of Zp activity by 20 and 50 \u03bcM emodin also showed a similar pattern, indicating that elements required for emodin inhibition reside in region \u221299 to \u221251. There are two major domains located within this region, Z1D and ZII. Z1D is known to be involved in SP1/SP3 and MEF2D regulation; ZII contains several transcriptional factor binding sites important for Zp activation, including ATF-1, ATF-2, and CREB. To determine which regulatory factor is important for emodin inhibition, four Zp constructs with mutations in Z1D and ZII domains, designated as mZ1D-1, mZ1D-2, ZII-1, and ZII-2, respectively, were used for compound treatment and luciferase-reporting assay mentioned above. As shown in Figure 6b, emodin inhibition phenomenon was compromised significantly in mZ1D-1, mZII-1, and mZII-2, whereas the activity of mZ1D-2 maintained a similar level to the wild-type control. Among them, the inhibition fold in mZ1D-1 displayed a significant alteration and attracted our attention. We sought to determine whether emodin affects the expression of SP1. As shown in Figure 6c, SP1 expression was repressed by emodin in a dose-dependent manner with or without TPA+SB co-treatment, implying emodin inhibits Zp activity by repressing SP1 expression. Finally, we sought to identify whether emodin-elicited Zp inhibition is mediated by SP1 repression. We transfected SP1-expressing plasmid to resupply the SP1 protein level under the emodin treatment and determined whether the Zp activity can be compensated. The results revealed that TPA+SB-activated Zp activity was repressed by emodin significantly (Figure 6d, left panel), however, this repression was compensated gradually when resupplied with SP1 (Figure 6d, right panel). To sum up, these results suggested that emodin inhibits EBV reactivation through SP1 repression.",

To test whether emodin can inhibit the EBV reactivation-induced tumorigenic properties, the cell culture model with repeated EBV reactivation combined with emodin treatment was used to examine the impact of emodin on the reactivation-induced malignant characteristics of NA cells. First, 10 repeated TS-induced NA cells with or without emodin treatment were subjected to micronucleus (MN) formation assay. As expected, we observed emodin affectively and does-dependently decreased MN formation, a prominent feature associated with EBV reactivation (Figure 7a). Next, since EBV reactivation has been implicated in several tumorigenic properties of NPC cells, including cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell invasion [24,26], we sought to determine whether emodin suppresses these malignant properties induced by recurrent EBV reactivation. As shown in Figure 7b, an increase of cell proliferation was observed in the TS-treated group. This increase was gradually reduced with emodin treatment. Similarly, cell migration (Figure 7c) and cell invasion (Figure 7d) of TS-treated NA were significantly repressed by emodin treatment, reinforcing the notion that emodin is capable of suppressing various malignant features of NA cells imposed by recurrent EBV reactivation.",

In our previous study, we found that it is too toxic if we administrated TPA plus SB to the mice and sole SB treatment is less toxic and is enough to reactivate the EBV harboring in NA cells in mice [26]. Approximately 4 weeks later, when the tumor size reached 0.5 cm, the mice were randomly assigned into four groups: mock, emodin, SB, and SB+emodin. Each compound was intraperitoneally administered into the mice every 3 or 4 days (Figure 8a). Of note, 0.6 mg/kg SB was sufficient to reactivate EBV lytic cycle and did not have a toxic effect in vivo (Figure 8b). After two weeks, the tumors were harvested for weighing and analysis. In the SB group, we found the average of tumor size increased after SB treatment, compared to the mock control (Figure 8c); however, this increase was repressed by emodin administration (Figure 8c). Meanwhile, the tumor size of the emodin group was similar to that of the mock control (Figure 8c). When we measured the tumor weights of the SB group, they were also heavier than those of the control group; however, the tumor weights were lower in the SB+emodin group (Figure 8d). Taken together, these results suggest that emodin has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth in the mouse model, via inhibition of EBV reactivation.",

As one of the etiological agents of NPC, EBV has been marked as a therapeutic target for a long time. Large numbers of studies have focused on EBV latent proteins, including EBNA1, LMP1, and LMP2. At the present time, through the efforts of many scientists, the lytic cycle of EBV has been gradually unmasked to understand how it contributes to NPC tumorigenesis. We now know that the various EBV lytic proteins make different contributions to tumor progression, e.g., DNase and terminase cause genomic instability [20,22], Rta and BGLF4 induce chromosome aberration [19,37], BALF1 and BHRF1 exhibit an anti-apoptotic effect [16,21], and so on. Based on these findings, we can treat EBV reactivation as a target to develop the anti-cancer therapy and, moreover, several clinical trials to determine whether treatment with anti-EBV compounds could relieve the NPC tumorigenesis are in progress.",

            "text": "Recently, antimicrobial adjuvant therapies have become very popular for treating virus-related cancers and cancer-associated infections. EBV lytic replication-based therapies attract attention for cancer therapy and two treatment strategies are being developed vigorously. One is the inhibition of EBV reactivation to repress tumor growth and the other is the induction of EBV reactivation to enable cytolytic therapy [38]. Compared to the latter, the strategy of inhibiting the EBV lytic cycle has at least three benefits for anti-cancer therapy. First, blocking the EBV lytic cycle may stop the cell to cell transmission of EBV; second, inhibition of EBV reactivation could also reduce the expression of oncogenic lytic proteins and; third, suppressing EBV reactivation attenuates the oncogenic endocrine factors releasing after EBV enters the lytic cycle. These advantages have led to a massive search for new compounds, active against EBV lytic replication. Until now, many small molecules have been found to effectively suppress EBV lytic reactivation, especially natural compounds. Among the family of polyphenolics, EGCG attracts the most attention for anti-EBV activity and has been shown to inhibit EBV reactivation by repressing the MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways [33,39]. Curcumin has been found to inhibit EBV reactivation through interference with BZLF1 gene transcription [40]. Resveratrol has been found to have anti-EBV activity through suppression of the activation of the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1 [41]. Sulforaphane is an anti-EBV agent that reduces the transactivation activity of Rta protein [42]. Among the family of flavonoids, luteolin has been shown to inhibit EBV reactivation by interfering with SP1 binding to Zp and Rp, and it represses tumor growth in a mouse model [25,26]. Genistein has anti-EBV activity through blocking the activation of IgG-mediated tyrosine kinase [43] and protoapigenone acts against EBV by reducing Zta transcriptional activity [44]. In addition to these two major families of natural compounds, andrographolide and moronic acid also have been reported to inhibit IE protein expression, with anti-EBV activity in the B-cell system [45,46]. Interestingly, most of these compounds are found in B-cell system in which the cellular environment may differ from the epithelial cells and may have less effect in an epithelial cell system. In fact, EBV prefers to remain latent in the B cells and progress to the lytic stage in epithelial cells. Thus, in our laboratory, we make an effort to search in the epithelial cell system for natural anti-EBV compounds for NPC therapy. Through preliminary screening, we found several compounds with anti-EBV activities and have reported some of them. In this study, we report another compound, emodin, which was found by our screening and has potential anti-EBV activity. We carried out immunoblotting (Figure 2), immunofluorescence assays (Figure 3a,b), and flow cytometric analysis (Figure 3c,d) to show that emodin treatment inhibits the expression of EBV lytic proteins. We also demonstrated that emodin decreases EB virion production in NPC cell lines. Further experiments indicate that emodin repressed the promoter activities of Zp and Rp (Figure 5). To dissect the underlying mechanism, the Z1D and ZII domains were shown to be involved in Zp inhibition by emodin, which may be through the downregulation of SP1 expression (Figure 6). Finally, we showed that the administration of emodin restrains the reactivation-induced tumorigenic properties and represses tumor growth in a mouse model. All of these results suggest that emodin has potential for EBV-based NPC therapy.",

            "text": "Although we demonstrated that the emodin inhibits EBV reactivation by interfering with SP1 expression, this raises a further question: how does emodin affect SP1 expression? It is well-known that the expression of SP1 is highly dependent on the cell cycle. Regulation of SP1-dependent transcription is affected by several pathways, including the amount of SP1 protein, its DNA binding activity, and its transactivation activity. Through analyzing the composition of SP1 promoter, regulation of SP1 expression has been shown to depend on the relative amounts of SP1, SP3, E2F, and NF-Y proteins in the cell nucleus [50]. Because emodin is able to inhibit E2F expression [51], accordingly, one possible mechanism by which emodin inhibits SP1 expression is through inhibition of E2F expression. Moreover, overexpression of p53 also has been found to decrease sp1 mRNA [52] and emodin is able to upregulate the p53 protein level to arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis [53]. Hence, emodin treatment may inhibit SP1 expression by upregulation of p53. In addition, we might also reasonably postulate that emodin may interfere with SP1 expression via its anti-oxidative activity, because SP1 is upregulated in cells by oxidative stress [54].",

Based on its great anti-EBV activity, emodin treatment can inhibit the reactivation-elicited tumorigenic properties, including MN formation, cell proliferation, migration, matrigel invasiveness, even tumor growth in mice.
