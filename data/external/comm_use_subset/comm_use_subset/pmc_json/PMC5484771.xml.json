Approximately 50% of the hog production is concentrated in three states, namely, Iowa, North Carolina, and Minnesota (4). The concentration of such a large population in a relatively small area resulted in high density, and consequently, relatively high vulnerability of the industry to the introduction and spread of infectious diseases. The industry has tried to mitigate this vulnerability by increasing biosecurity and other prevention strategies, including air filtration and quarantine of incoming pigs (5, 6).",

The disease, caused by the infection of an Arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSv), emerged in the U.S. in the late 1980s and, since then, has remained prevalent in the country (9, 10). PRRSv is an RNA virus, which has led to the appearance of a wide array of emerging or reemerging strains with a large variety of phenotypic and genotypic features (11). Commercial vaccines do not prevent infection although they are reported to reduce virus shedding and decrease clinical impact. Protection is reported to be more profound after infection with homologous than heterologous strains (12, 13). Modified live vaccines are more effective than those formulated with inactivated virus (14). Many alternative mechanisms of transmission have been described for PRRSv, including direct transmission through the movement of pigs and indirect through fomites, insects, semen, or airborne spread (6, 15\u201320). The American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV) developed a classification system with four categories based on infection status in sow herds. A herd was defined as \u201cunstable\u201d if field virus could be detected within the herd. These categories are referred to as positive unstable (Category I), positive stable (Category II), provisional negative (Category III), and negative (Category IV) (21). In the absence of a regulatory framework, data on farm-level infection incidence can only be collected on a voluntary basis in the U.S.",

Initially, participants shared weekly PRRS status data for sow farms, following and adapting AASV guidelines (21). As the program progressed, the MSHMP expanded, and some participants are also sharing data for porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and porcine delta corona virus. The MSHMP is quite unique because, despite its voluntary nature, it currently receives weekly data from sow farms corresponding to approximately 45% (n = 2,854,000) of the sows in the country according to the U.S. Census (3), and for that reason, it is, arguably, one of the largest datasets of voluntarily shared information by producers on swine health in the world. The MSHMP, therefore, demonstrates how epidemiological knowledge on one of the most pressing diseases for a large industry may be gained through the analysis of routinely collected data, as part of a private\u2013academic partnership and in the absence of a regulatory framework.",

Spatial trends in PRRS case distribution after PED emergence were similar to those found in previous studies at the national level (23, 24), although PRRS incidence decreased during that year.

Time within the analyzed period (24 months) and the probability of sharing PRRS status to the voluntary regional control program were negatively associated with disease outbreaks, while density (as number of farms per square mile) was positively associated with PRRS outbreaks. Findings in this study showed that despite a statistical decreasing trend of the disease, spatiotemporal clustering of PRRS was observed along the whole study period. In turn, farm type (i.e., farms with and without breeding herds) did not show a specific association with PRRS, although farms with sows were more prone to report PRRS status in the RCP-N212 (25).",

In the absence of a regulatory framework, data sharing is a prerequisite for increasing disease awareness and, ultimately, supporting its control.

For example, the proportional importance of transmission routes (air, pig movement, or fomites) in the spread of the disease and whether that pattern is mostly influenced by system or region remain unknown. The application of different analytical tools to the rich dataset assessed here has helped producers and practitioners to better understand the epidemiological dynamics of PRRS. For example, we learned that the onset of the disease had a repetitive pattern and a similar starting point from the first 4 years of data of the project, from 2009 to 2012 (23). However, data from 2013 and 2014, when PED emerged in the country, failed to signal the epidemics at the same date as predicted by previous years, showing a delay of 3 weeks (24). Also during that same season (2013 and 2014), the same cohort of farms showed a 50% decrease in the number of PRRS outbreaks between October and March when compared with the average observed in the same season in the previous four previous years. Many factors may have impacted the change in disease pattern observed that year, including an increase of biosecurity practices associated with PED emergence, an increase of PRRS vaccination, secular cycles, or difficulty performing the routine PRRSv diagnostics following high PED mortality rates. Furthermore, no changes in the centroid of the epidemic clusters were observed between 2009 and 2014, suggesting that although incidence decreased that year, the spatial dependence of the disease prevailed. Preliminary results of disaggregating national data and aggregating cases from different states (not published) seem to point to a different temporal incidence trend between geographical regions and/or systems, and those could be caused by different factors as management, density or different climate conditions as pointed by the ecological niche modeling (see text footnote 1).",
