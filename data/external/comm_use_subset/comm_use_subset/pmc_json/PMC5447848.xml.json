Controls were randomly selected children from the community without severe or very severe pneumonia and were frequency matched for age (4 age strata) within 2 weeks of the matched case enrollment. Blood, NP/OP swab specimens, and urine were collected from both cases and controls; blood cultures and IS specimens were also collected from cases.",

We compared PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values (a semiquantitative measure of pathogen load) in IS specimens from radiographic pneumonia and nonpneumonia case groups, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. To compare demographic and baseline characteristics of individuals between study groups, we calculated frequencies for categorical variables and median values with interquartile ranges (75th centile minus 25th centile) for continuous variables. To evaluate the similarity of our mock control group (ie, nonpneumonia cases) with true control children, we compared the prevalence of organisms detected in the NP/OP specimens and calculated odds ratios and 95% CIs.

The added value in the detection of P. jirovecii was minimal in the HIV-positive children with radiographic pneumonia; however, collection of both IS and NP/OP specimens provides the highest yield and may be worthwhile to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. Determination of infection versus colonization with P. jirovecii in these cases would require assessment of organism density and clinical correlation [34]. Although the diagnostic yield from an IS specimen may not be sufficient to justify this mildly invasive procedure as a routine part of the diagnostic workup for CAP, IS specimens are still important in cases with suspected tuberculosis and may also be useful in those in whom certain other pathogens (eg, B. pertussis, M. pneumoniae) are suspected. The lack of utility of bacterial cultures of IS specimens in determining the cause of pneumonia in children <5 years of age is reported on elsewhere [20].",
