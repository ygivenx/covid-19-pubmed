Each of the tanks had interchangeable door modules so that the single- and double- version of the doors could be swapped as required for the experiments. Otherwise the tanks were of virtually identical dimensions. The same scale model of a human male figure was used in each tank to maintain similarity. The figure moved on a sliding track that was built into the floor of each tank, and which could be programmed to move at realistic human walking speeds. This track was regularly greased to ensure a smooth sliding action without juddering. The movement controller chip (Arduino Mega 1280, ATmega1280 (Silicon Core), Arduino, Chiasso, Switzerland) for each of the tanks was manually programmed to allow the figure and doors to move at speeds similar to those observed in real isolation facilities.",

Once the seal was in place, the tank was slowly filled with water from the bottom up via a supply pipe entering the floor of the tank. This facilitated the removal of air bubbles from the tank, as it filled, which would otherwise obstruct clear views of the tank from the top that were required for filming. The tank was also placed on a custom-built table which allows a tilt of up to 45\u00b0 when the tank was full, to allow any air bubbles to escape through small drainage air-holes that were drilled into the roof along its edge. Any remaining bubbles were manually suctioned using a 30 ml or 50 ml syringe and small-bore catheter that was passed through these air-holes, as required. Once the bubbles had been removed and the tank leveled again, 50 mls of blue food dye (True Blue, Star Brand, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) was injected into one side of the tank, as required by the experimental protocol, i.e. into the side containing the human figure (the \u2018from dye\u2019 protocol), or into the side without the figure (the \u2018to dye\u2019 protocol).

For the hinged-doors, both slow (Table 1, Videos S3\u2013S4) and fast (Table 2, Figures 5 and 6) angular velocities were investigated. This was done because the effect of these door-opening motions on the movements of the food dye were much more dramatic and it was of interest to capture these flows at these two speeds, with the fast parameters being approximately twice those of the slow parameters.

The access to the isolation room was a standard single hinged-door that opened into the room. The non-immune nurse developed chickenpox 10 days later. Transmission of the same virus between the patient and the nurse was confirmed by viral sequencing of skin lesion samples taken from both individuals. The negative pressure difference across the doorway was measured to be only 3 Pa and it was postulated that this was readily reversed each time the door was opened to receive the supplies. This may have been a fairly typical pressure differential found in many hospital isolation units at this time, and it is clear from this incident that this was probably insufficient to maintain the containment during a door-opening motion event. Additional qualitative flow visualization studies were performed using food dye in a small-scale, water-tank model under the principle of Reynolds number equivalence, to exam the action of the hinged-door opening motion on the airflow across the doorway. These additional experiments confirmed that the hinged-door opening motion into the isolation room was likely to have caused a transient reversal of the negative pressure, allowing airborne virus to leak out and be inhaled and infect the non-immune nurse standing outside. However, the water-tank model developed for this study (with a hand-operated hinged-door) was relatively simple and crude, and this study extends this model and tests double and sliding-door options, also.",

Eames et al.
