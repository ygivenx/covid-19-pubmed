A rich body of research [1],[2],[3] has provided major insights into the processes that drive epidemics, and has been instrumental in developing strategies for control and eradication. The structure of contact networks is crucial in explaining epidemiological patterns seen in the spread of directly transmissible diseases such as HIV/AIDS [1],[4],[5], SARS [6],[7], influenza [8],[9],[10],[11] etc. For example, the basic reproductive number R0, a quantity central to developing intervention measures or immunization programs, depends crucially on the variance of the distribution of contacts [1],[12],[13], known as the network degree distribution. Contact networks with fat-tailed degree distributions, for example, where a few individuals have an extraordinarily large number of contacts, result in a higher R0 than one would expect from contact networks with a uniform degree distribution, and the existence of highly connected individuals makes them an ideal target for control measures [7],[14].",

Despite the demonstration that social networks show significant community structure [15],[16],[17],[18], and that social processes such as homophily and transitivity result in highly clustered and modular networks [19], the effect of such microstructures on epidemic dynamics has only recently started to be investigated. Most initial work has focused on the effect of small cycles, predominantly in the context of clustering coefficients (i.e. the fraction of closed triplets in a contact network) [20],[21],[22],[23],[24].",

Community structure exists when connections between members of a group of nodes are more dense than connections between members of different groups of nodes [15]. The terminology is relatively new in network analysis and recent algorithm development has greatly expanded our ability to detect sub-structuring in networks. While there has been a recent explosion in interest and methodological development, the concept is an old one in the study of social networks where it is typically referred to as a \u201ccohesive subgroups,\u201d groups of vertices in a graph that share connections with each other at a higher rate than with vertices outside the group [18]. Empirical data on social structure suggests that community structuring is extensive in epidemiological contacts [25],[26],[27] relevant for infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g. influenza-like illnesses), and in social groups more generally [16],[17],[28],[29],[30]. Similarly, the results of epidemic models of directly transmitted infections such as influenza are most consistent with the existence of such structure [8],[9],[11],[31],[32],[33].",

A particular feature of such networks is that the variance of their degree distribution is relatively low, and thus the spread of a disease is only marginally affected by it [34]. Running standard susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR) epidemic simulations (see Methods) on these networks, we find that the average epidemic size, epidemic duration and the peak prevalence of the epidemic are strongly affected by a change in community structure connectivity that is independent of the overall degree distribution of the full network (Figure 1). Note that the value range of Q shown in Figure 1 is in agreement with the value range of Q found in the empirical networks used further below, and that lower values of Q do not affect the results qualitatively (see Suppl.

In networks with strong community structure, an infected individual is more likely to infect members of the same community than members outside of the community. Thus, in a network with strong community structure, local outbreaks may die out before spreading to other communities, or they may spread through various communities in an almost serial fashion, and large epidemics in populations with strong community structure may therefore last for a long time. Correspondingly, the incidence rate can be very low, and the number of generations of infection transmission can be very high, compared to the explosive epidemics in populations with less community structure (Figures 2a and 2b). On average, epidemics in networks with strong community structure exhibit greater variance in final size (Figures 2c and 2d), a greater number of small, local outbreaks that do not develop into a full epidemic, and a higher variance in the duration of an epidemic.",

            "text": "In order to halt or mitigate an epidemic, targeted immunization interventions or social distancing interventions aim to change the structure of the network of susceptible individuals in such a way as to make it harder for a pathogen to spread [35]. In practice, the number of people to be removed from the susceptible class is often constrained for a number of reasons (e.g., due to limited vaccine supply or ethical concerns of social distancing measures). From a network perspective, targeted immunization methods translate into indentifying which nodes should be removed from a network, a problem that has caught considerable attention (see for example [36] and references therein). Targeting highly connected individuals for immunization has been shown to be an effective strategy for epidemic control [7],[14]. However, in networks with strong community structure, this strategy may not be the most effective: some individuals connect to multiple communities (so-called community bridges [37]) and may thus be more important in spreading the disease than individuals with fewer inter-community connections, but this importance is not necessarily reflected in the degree. Identification of community bridges can be achieved using the betweenness centrality measure [38], defined as the fraction of shortest paths a node falls on. While degree and betweenness centrality are often strongly positively correlated, the correlation between degree and betweenness centrality becomes weaker as community structure becomes stronger (Figure 3). Thus, in networks with community structure, focusing on the degree alone carries the risk of missing some of the community bridges that are not highly connected. Indeed, at a low vaccination coverage, an immunization strategy based on betweenness centrality results in fewer infected cases than an immunization strategy based on degree as the magnitude of community structure increases (Figure 4a). This observation is critical because the potential vaccination coverage for an emerging infection will typically be very low. A third measure, random walk centrality, identifies target nodes by a random walk, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes [39]. The random walk centrality measure considers not only the shortest paths between pairs of nodes, but all paths between pairs of nodes, while still giving shorter paths more weight. While infections are most likely to spread along the shortest paths between any two nodes, the cumulative contribution of other paths can still be important [40]: immunization strategies based on random walk centrality result in the lowest number of infected cases at low vaccination coverage (Figure 4b and 4c).",

Thus, algorithms that are agnostic about the full network structure are necessary to identify target individuals. The only algorithm we are aware of that is completely agnostic about the network structure network structure identifies target nodes by picking a random contact of a randomly chosen individual [42]. Once such an acquaintance has been picked n times, it is immunized. The acquaintance method has been shown to be able to identify some of the highly connected individuals, and thus approximates an immunization strategy that targets highly connected individuals. We propose an alternative algorithm (the so-called community bridge finder (CBF) algorithm, described in detail in the Methods) that aims to identify community bridges connecting two groups of clustered nodes. Briefly, starting from a random node, the algorithm follows a random path on the contact network, until it arrives at a node that does not connect back to more than one of the previously visited nodes on the random walk. The basic goal of the CBF algorithm is to find nodes that connect to multiple communities - it does so based on the notion that the first node that does not connect back to previously visited nodes of the current random walk is likely to be part of a different community. On all empirical and computationally generated networks tested, this algorithm performed mostly better, often equally well, and rarely worse than the alternative algorithm.",

A comparison between algorithms is therefore of limited use if they are not of the same type as they have to work with different inputs. Clearly, a deterministic algorithm with information on the full network structure as input should outperform a stochastic algorithm that is agnostic about the full network structure.

One of the most important consequences of incorporating network structure into epidemic models was the demonstration that heterogeneity in the number of contacts (degree) can strongly affect how R0 is calculated [12],[13],[34]. Thus, the same disease can exhibit markedly different epidemic patterns simply due to differences in the degree distribution. Our results extend this finding and show that even in networks with the same degree distribution, fundamentally different epidemic dynamics are expected to be observed due to different levels of community structure. This finding is important for various reasons: first, community structure has been shown to be a crucial feature of social networks [15],[16],[17],[19], and its effect on disease spread is thus relevant to infectious disease dynamics. Furthermore, it corroborates earlier suggestions that community structure affects the spread of disease, and is the first to clearly isolate this effect from effects due to variance in the degree distribution [43]. Second, and consequently, data on the degree distribution of contact networks will not be sufficient to predict epidemic dynamics. Third, the design of control strategies benefits from taking community structure into account.",

Such overlap is likely to play an important role in infectious disease dynamics, because people are members of multiple, potentially overlapping communities (households, schools, workplaces etc.). A strong overlap would likely be reflected in lower overall values for Q; however, the exact effect of community overlap on infectious disease dynamics remains to be investigated.",

There are however two major issues associated with this problem: (i) the structure of networks is often not known, and (ii) many networks are too large to compute, for example, centrality measures efficiently. Stochastic algorithms like the proposed CBF algorithm or the acquaintance method address both problems at once. To what extent targeted immunization strategies can be implemented in a infectious diseases/public health setting based on practical and ethical considerations remains an open question. This is true not only for the strategy based on the CBF algorithm, but for most strategies that are based on network properties. As mentioned above, the contact networks relevant for the spread of infectious diseases are generally not known. Stochastic algorithms such as the CBF or the acquaintance method are at least in principle applicable when data on network structure is lacking.",

Targeted immunization of individuals connecting subpopulations has been shown to be an effective low-coverage immunization strategy for the conservation of endangered species [46]. Under the assumption of homogenous mixing, the elimination of a disease requires an immunization coverage of at least 1-1/R0\n[1] but such coverage is often difficult or even impossible to achieve due to limited vaccine supply, logistical challenges or ethical concerns. In the case of wildlife animals, high vaccination coverage is also problematic as vaccination interventions can be associated with substantial risks. Little is known about the contact network structure in humans, let alone in wildlife, and progress should therefore be made on the development of immunization strategies that can deal with the absence of such data. Stochastic algorithms such as the acquaintance method and the CBF method are first important steps in addressing the problem, but the large difference in efficacy between stochastic and deterministic algorithms demonstrates that there is still a long way to go.",

Then, during a number of time steps, the initial infection can spread through the network, and the simulation is halted once there are no further infected nodes. At each time step (the unit of time we use is one day, i.e. a time step is one day), an infected node can get infected with probability 1\u2212exp(\u2212\u03b2i), where \u03b2 is the transmission rate from an infected to a susceptible node, and i is the number of infected neighboring nodes. At each time step, infected nodes recover at rate \u03b3, i.e. the probability of recovery of an infected node per time step is \u03b3 (unless noted otherwise, we use \u03b3 = 0.2). If recovery occurs, the state of the recovered node is toggled from infected to resistant. Unless mentioned otherwise, the transmission rate \u03b2 is chosen such that R0\u223c(\u03b2/\u03b3) * d\u22483 where d is the mean network degree, i.e the average number of contacts per node. For the networks used here, this approximation is in line with the result from static network theory [47], R0\u223cT(<k2>/<k>\u22121), where <k> and <k2> are the mean degree and mean square degree, respectively, and where T is the average probability of disease transmission from a node to a neighboring node, i.e. T\u2248\u03b2/\u03b3. Note that the variation in the degree is too small to be of relevance here (see further below and Figure 1d). The reason we chose \u03b3 = 0.2 (i.e. an average length of infectious period of 5 days) and R0\u22483 in most simulations (unless mentioned otherwise) is that these parameter values reflect, very roughly, some of the most widespread infectious diseases to which our study is relevant (i.e. flu-like infectious diseases that are transmitted directly from person to person by the respiratory or close-contact route [8],[9],[48],[49],[50]).",

We then add 2000 edges randomly between randomly chosen nodes, making sure that the edges fall between communities only. Thus, we create a graph with 2000 nodes and 10000 (i.e. (2000+50 * 40 * (8/2))) undirected edges where one out of five edges falls between communities. The average degree of the network is 10, which is in line with recent reports on social contact patterns [55]. Starting from this initial network where Q\u22480.76, we create networks with increasing community structure by rewiring between-community edges so that they become within-community edges. More precisely, at each rewiring step, we (i) randomly choose a between-community edge, (ii) randomly choose one of the two communities that the edge connects, (iii) pick a random node of the chosen community, and (iv) rewire the edge by detaching it from the node of the community that was not chosen in step (ii), and attaching it to the new node in the community that was chosen in step (iii). At all times, edges must always fall between two distinct nodes, and there can only be one edge between any two pair of nodes. We've also tested if all networks thus created consist of only a single connected component (they do).",

The goal of the CBF algorithm is to identify such individuals based on random walks, without knowledge of the network structure, and thus without knowledge of the communities in a network. The algorithm works as follows: pick a random node vi = 0 and follow a random path (one node at a time, with the only condition that a node has not been visited by the random walk before). At every node vi\u22652, check if there is more than one connection from vi to any of the visited nodes (the requirement for more than one connection stems from the simple fact that every node vi will have at least one connection to vi\u22121). If there is just one back connection (i.e. from vi to vi\u22121), a potential target vi\u22121 has been identified. As an additional check, pick two random neighboring nodes of vi (other than vi\u22121) and check for connections back to the previously visited nodes vj<i. If such connections exist, vi\u22121 is not a potential target - continue the random walk at vi\u22121. If no such connections exist, immunize the potential target. Discard all information about visits, and start again at a randomly picked node v0. A schematic sketch of the algorithm is outlined in Figure 7.",

For example, the frequency of nodes that can potentially meet the immunization requirement set by the algorithm might be smaller than the desired immunization coverage. To prevent endless searches for community bridges, two additional checks are implemented. First, the number of nodes in any running random path does not exceed 10 (this is implemented using a first-in-first-out list that keeps track of the visited nodes). Second, we keep track of all nodes visited, and if a node has been visited at least k times (on any random walk), it will be immunized. In all results presented in this manuscript, we use k = 2.",
