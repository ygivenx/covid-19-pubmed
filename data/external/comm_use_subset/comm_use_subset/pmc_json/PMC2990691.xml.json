            "text": "The genus Flavivirus is composed of more than 70 different closely related species [1]. Many flaviviruses are arthropod-borne and causes significant human diseases. Among these, the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are categorized as emerging global pathogens [2]. JEV is a mosquito-borne, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus, responsible for frequent epidemics of encephalitis, predominantly in children, in most parts of Southeast Asia and adjoining regions. It is the causal factor for 30,000\u201350,000 cases of encephalitis occurring every year and accounts for about 10,000 deaths annually with serious neurological squeal in the survivors [3]. JEV has been expanding its \u2018geographical footprint\u2019 into previously non-endemic regions and with several billion people at risk, Japanese encephalitis (JE) represents an internationally emerging concern in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Currently three types of JE vaccine are in use- the inactivated mouse-brain derived, the inactivated cell-culture derived and the live attenuated cell-culture derived. However, there are limitations for their usage in terms of availability, cost and safety [4]. At present, chemotherapy against JEV is largely supportive and not targeted towards the virus. A lot of avenues has been explored in the past and are also being currently tried, so as to develop a safe and effective molecule that would be able to prevent the virus from replicating within the host.",

The ORF encodes a polyprotein which is processed by viral and cellular proteases into three structural and seven non structural proteins [5], [6]. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of the JEV genome contain conserved sequence elements and can form conserved stem loop structure. 5\u2032 UTR contain secondary structures which are required for the formation of translation pre-initiation complex [7]. JEV requires long range RNA-RNA interaction between 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions of its genome for efficient replication; one such interaction occurs between a pair of 10 complementary nucleotides, located in coding sequence for the capsid protein at 136\u2013146 nucleotides from 5\u2032 end of the genome, and 3\u2032 cyclization sequence, commonly denoted as 3\u2032CSI (3\u2032 conserved sequence I) located at 104\u2013114 nucleotides from 3\u2032 end of the genome [8], [9]. The 3\u2032CSI is highly conserved across members of JEV serocomplex, indicating the possibility that RNA elements within the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs in JEV genome are essential for its replication.",

In one such study siRNA generated against the cd loop-coding sequence in domain II of the viral Envelope protein (which is highly conserved among all flaviviruses because of its essential role in membrane fusion) has been found to protect against lethal encephalitis [10]. Similarly siRNAs has also been generated against various nonstructural proteins of JEV and were found to be effective in inhibiting viral replication [11], [12]. Anti-sense approach has also been employed to inhibit flaviviral replication by generating anti-sense molecules against RNA elements within the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs in flaviviral genome. In one such approach, DNAzyme against 3\u2032 UTR of JEV genome has be found to be effective in controlling virus infection in a murine model [13]. Under the same approach but with different kind of anti-sense oligonuleuotide called Morpholino, flaviviral replication has been inhibited in cultured cells as well as in animal models [14], [15].",

For efficient delivery into cells these Morpholino are often conjugated with arginine rich peptide [17]. However, in the current study we have used a different type of Morpholino oligomer called Vivo-Morpholino against 3\u2032CSI and one of the secondary structures present in 5\u2032 UTR of the JEV genome. Vivo-Morpholino are specialized type of non-peptide Morpholino oligomers, conjugated with a new transport structure that provides effective delivery into a wide variety of tissues in living animals, thereby raising the possibilities of their use as therapeutic agents. The transporter comprises of a dendritic structure assembled around a triazine core which serves to position eight guanidinium head groups in a conformation effective to penetrate cell membranes. Vivo-Morpholinos have also been shown to effectively enter and function within cultured cells [18]. Vivo-Morpholinos are also cost effective, non immunogenic, and stable under physiological conditions as compared to other types of Morpholinos. This study was designed to evaluate whether the use of Vivo-Morpholinos as therapeutic agents, is possible in an experimental model of JE. We intend to show that these specifically designed Vivo-Morpholinos are effective in countering the viral load in the body, thereby imparting significant protection to the animals that were infected with a lethal dose of JEV.",

Unlike other types of anti-sense oligonucleotides, Morpholinos provide all the desired properties of stability, nuclease resistance, high efficacy, long-term activity, water solubility, low toxicity, and exquisite specificity. Morpholino oligomers has been used previously for the inhibition of flaviviral replication [14], [27] including JEV [15] though all of them has utilized peptide based Morpholinos. The peptide based Morpholinos contain delivery moiety evolved from natural peptides whose active components are 6\u20139 arginine residues in a bio-available 6-aminohexanoic-spaced structure [28]. However, these arginine-based peptides are not commercially available for research purposes and their greatest efficacies have been in delivering Morpholinos to the cytosol of tissues like liver [29] or leaky muscle [30], which would be considered as easily deliverable. As a result, the reach of peptide based Morpholinos into a wide spectrum of tissues remains questionable [18]. Also, owing to the peptidic nature, degradation of the peptide portion of the conjugates was found to be time and tissue dependent [31]. Furthermore, the applications of the arginine-rich peptide transporters are limited due to their high cost, scalability and stability. Added to that are the risks of immune responses against the peptides which limits repeated administrations for diseases requiring long-term treatment [32].",

MO was our choice of anti-sense molecule as this enabled us to test the specifically designed oligonucleotides in both animal as well as cell culture models. Though \u2018outstanding\u2019 results have been reported to be achieved by intravenous (i.v.) administration of the MO, we preferred the intraperitoneal route via which modest systemic delivery can be achieved. This was so done because brain has been reported to be an ineffective tissue when MOs are administered i.v. [33], though there is no direct evidence showing that MOs can cross blood brain barrier, when administered via other routes. According to the manufacturer's (Gene Tools LLC) instructions the maximum suggested dosage in mammals is 12.5 mg/kg in a 24 hour period. Our aim was to determine the minimum dose at which our desired effects could be achieved. Initially we had chosen two doses of 5 mg and 10 mg per kg body weight (b.w.) of the animals. We found that there was no significant difference between the survival rate of JEV-infected and MO treated mice in either dose (data not shown for 10 mg/kg b.w.). The survival rate was approximately 90% in those JEV-infected animals that were treated with 3\u2032 MO and 75% in animals treated with 5\u2032 MO. Thus we decided to proceed with the 5 mg/kg b.w. dose for all subsequent experiments.",

The 3\u2032 MO was generated against the 3\u2032 CSI region of the JEV genome that interacts with 5\u2032 CS region located in coding sequence for capsid protein at 136\u2013146 nucleotides from 5\u2032 terminal of the genome. This interaction results in cyclization of JEV genome that is necessary for its efficient replication. The 5\u2032 MO was targeted towards one of the secondary structures of the 5\u2032 UTR that are required for the formation of translation pre-initiation complex. Blocking of these two sites in the JEV genome leads to the most likely effect, i.e. inhibition of replication and translation of viral genome. This was further corroborated by the decrease in the expressions of viral proteins (NS5, E glycoprotein and general flaviviral envelop protein) in the brain. Flaviviral NS5 is known to possess guanylyltransferase activity that helps in the synthesis of methylated cap structure at the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome that plays a crucial role in the translation and stability of mRNAs [34]. The JEV E glycoprotein is believed to be involved in viral adhesion and entry into host cells, hemagglutination, cellular tropism, viral virulence, and the induction of protective immune responses [35]. Decreased expression of these proteins indicates that viral replication and production of new infective viral particles are inhibited due to the MOs. Immunohistochemical staining for viral antigen also provided visual confirmation of the fact that JEV antigen was detected at much lower amounts in the brain following MO treatment. However, these data does not prove that MOs directly inhibit infective viral particle production in the brain itself, as it cannot be conclusively stated whether the MOs can reach brain. These data merely suggests that the number of replication-competent infective JEV in the brain was significantly reduced, which subsequently leads to neuroprotection.",

JEV infection has also been shown to activate stress kinases, which in turn results in activation of ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK pathway leading to apoptotic death of neurons [39]. In accordance with the established results, here also we found that there was similar activation pattern of these molecules in JEV-infected and JEV-infected and SC-MO treated animal brain samples. Treatment with the MOs resulted in abrogation of those changes that led to greater survivality of brain neurons as observed by histochemical staining. Activation of p38MAPK is also related to the transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes in the brain [40]. Thus the decrease in phophoP38 MAPK levels correlates with the decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokine levels in obtained from the brain.",

There have been studies regarding the anti-JEV effects of other types of Morpholino oligomers though none of them are yet to be considered for therapeutic purposes. This is the first study that investigates the role of Morpholino oligomers specially designed for effective delivery into live animal models. Generally, the i.p route of administration of any drug is preferred in animal studies over any other routes. However, the efficacy of these antisense molecules needs to be checked by administering through other applicable routes, as i.p. administration in humans is uncommon, though not unheard of. The amounts of oligomers required and the route of administration in this study marks these molecules as practicable therapeutic agents in JE, though further studies are required before these can be recommended for clinical trials.",
