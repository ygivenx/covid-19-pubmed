            "text": "In humans, five IFITM isoforms have been discovered thus far [20]. IFITM5 is found in osteoblasts and functions in bone mineralization while IFITM10 has an unknown function [21, 22]. The remaining three members (IFITM1, 2, and 3) have been characterized with antiviral activity [20, 23]. The IFITM proteins are localized to both the plasma membrane and the endosomal membranes where they are thought to restrict viral entry by directly modulating cell membranes or antagonizing components of the viral structure [19, 24\u201329]. While the exact topology of IFITMs remains unclear, studies have suggested that the IFITMs have full or partial membrane-spanning regions, with the N-terminus and a conserved central region on the cytosolic side and the C-terminus being extracellular [26, 30, 31]. The N-terminus of human IFITM2 and IFITM3 contain an additional 20 or 21 amino acids, respectively, compared to IFITM1. This extended N-terminal region contains a tyrosine residue (Y20) that is important for IFITM localization and their antiviral activity [32\u201334]. Recently, the PPxY motif of IFITM3 was discovered to interact with the NEDD4 E3 ligase that causes IFITM3 ubiquitination [35]. Cysteine residues C71, C72, and C105 in IFITM3, which are also conserved in IFITM1 and IFITM2, are palmitoylated and contribute to its antiviral function [24, 31]. Two phenylalanine residues (F75 and F78) in IFITM3 mediate interaction amongst the IFITMs, increasing IFITM3 antiviral properties [36]. Interestingly, IFITM proteins have also been shown to promote infection or replication of some viruses, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined [37, 38].",

            "text": "HIV-1 and HIV-2 are the results of zoonotic transmission of SIV into humans from chimpanzee and sooty mangabey, respectively [39, 40]. Adaptation into new hosts often requires viruses to evolve countermeasures to evade new host defenses. For example, TRIM5\u03b1 from rhesus monkey (TRIM5\u03b1rh) is highly effective at restricting HIV-1 [5]. However, TRIM5\u03b1rh does not restrict viruses that naturally infect Old World monkeys (SIVmac). These observations were attributed to changes in the sequence of viral capsid from SIV to HIV [5]. Similarly, human Tetherin is less effective restricting HIV when compared to that of SIV and vice versa [41]. The decreased inhibitory effects of human TRIM5\u03b1 and Tetherin on HIV-1 account for efficient spread and pathogenesis of HIV-1 in humans [42].",

Briefly, the total RNAs were extracted from these non-human primate cell lines using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out by using 1\u03bcg of total RNA, plus random primer (Thermal Fisher Scientific) and Superscript III (Invitrogen) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. IFITM genes were PCR amplified from cDNAs using primers IFITM1 forward/reverse (CAACAGGGGAAAGCAGGGCTC/ CTGTATCTAGGGGCAGGACCAAG) and IFITM3 forward/reverse (CAACACTTCTTTCCCCAAAGCCAG/ TTGTGGACAGGTGTGTGGG). PCR products were cloned into PCR2.1 vector, and 3\u20135 clones from each species were sequenced. A Flag tag was introduced to the N termini of primate IFITMs by PCR, and the insert IFITM genes in PCR2.1 were subcloned into pQCXIP vector at BamHI and EcoRI sites. All IFITM genes on pQCXIP vector were confirmed by DNA sequencing.",

While it was previously shown that IFITMs from African green monkey (AGM) are capable of restricting both HIV-1 and SIVagm to varying degrees [49], we further sought to know if the IFITMs from additional nonhuman primates are capable of restricting HIV. To do so, we cloned IFITM1 and IFITM3 from 8 nonhuman primate cell lines belonging to the families Cercopithecidae (old world monkey; OWM) and Hominidae (hominoids), stably expressed them in the CD4+ T cell line SupT1, and tested their ability to restrict HIV (Table 1, Fig 1). SupT1 cells were infected with HIV-1 (NL4.3 or BH10) or HIV-2 bearing VSV-G in order to achieve efficient infection, and newly produced virus was harvested 48 hours later. Infectivity of newly generated virus was measured using the indicator cell line HeLa-TZM-bl (TZM-bl), which is susceptible to both CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic viruses. Against HIV-1 NL4.3, we found that both human IFITM1 and IFITM3 had less than a two-fold reduction in infectivity, similar to our previous results [50], while we found up to an approximate 5- and 10-fold reduction in infectivity for the majority of nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 tested (Fig 1A). Against HIV-1-BH10, human IFITM1 resulted in an approximate 4-fold reduction in infectivity while human IFITM3 caused less than a 2-fold reduction (Fig 1B), again paralleling our previous reports [15, 51]. Notably, nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 reduced HIV-1 BH10 infectivity up to 10- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig 1B). Interestingly, against HIV-2, we found only a two-fold reduction in infectivity against almost all species of IFITMs (Fig 1C). Similar to human IFITMs [29, 32], nonhuman primate IFITMs did not significantly inhibit release of HIV-1 and HIV-2 from viral producer cells based on their RT activities (data not shown). Western blotting analysis showed that the expression levels of these nonhuman primate IFITMs were approximately comparable to their human counterparts (Fig 1D). Altogether, these results suggest that HIV-1 is strongly, but differentially, restricted by IFITMs of nonhuman primate species.",

We therefore tested whether or not nonhuman primate IFITMs could also restrict different strains of SIV in SupT1 cells stably expressing individual IFITM proteins. We found that, while some nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 (such as Gorilla, L'Hoest's and Moustached) caused an approximate 2 to 3-fold reduction in infectivity of SIVcpz, others showed activity similar to that of humans (less than 2-fold) (Fig 2A). Against SIVmac, human IFITM1 and IFITM3 caused roughly a 2-fold reduction in infectivity while nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 resulted in up to a 7- and 10-fold reduction, respectively (Fig 2B). The most striking differences between human and nonhuman primate IFITM restriction of SIV was found against SIVagm. While human IFITMs caused an approximate 2- to 3-fold reduction in infectivity, nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 restricted SIVagm by up to15 to 40-fold in infectivity (Fig 2C). Of note, the antiviral activities of IFITM1 derived from Sykes and Guereza, as well as IFITM3 derived from Mandrill, Guereza, and Mangabey, were much weaker against both SIVmac and SIVagm than IFITMs of other species, again highlighting the species-dependent antiviral activities of IFITMs.",

            "text": "Recently, our lab demonstrated that human IFITM proteins contribute to HIV-1 restriction by antagonizing envelope protein (Env), thereby impairing viral fusion, infectivity and cell-to-cell infection [29]. We sought to ask if association of human IFITM with HIV-1 Env is conserved in OWM IFITMs. Because of its strong inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity (Fig 1), we chose L'Hoest's IFITMs to represent OWM. We co-transfected 293T cells with HIV-1 NL4.3 and flag-tagged human or L'Hoest's IFITMs, followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-flag beads. Both human and OWM IFITM3 proteins were capable of interacting with HIV-1 Env in a dose-dependent manner, showing that IFITM-envelope interaction has been evolutionarily conserved (Fig 3A). When we compared the band intensity ratios between immunoprecipitated HIV-1 Env gp41 and flag-IFITM3, we found an approximate 20% increase in OWM IFITM3 interaction with HIV-1 Env compared to that with human IFITM3 (Fig 3B); this was despite the relatively low levels of Env expression in the OWM IFITM3-expressing cells as compared to cells expressing human IFITM3 (Fig 3A; see gp120 and gp41 blots). Human IFITM1 had no significant interaction HIV-1 Env (Fig 3A). Both human and OWM IFITM3 proteins inhibited the processing of Env precursor into gp120 and gp41 (Fig 3A, top panel), whereas the IFITM1 protein downregulated the expression of HIV-1 Env and Gag at higher doses of transfection (Fig 3A; see gp41 and p24 blots) similar to our recent study [29]. These results demonstrate that Env interaction with IFITMs, as well as their effects on Env processing, are evolutionarily conserved among human and nonhuman primates species and that the increased interaction between L'Hoest's IFITM3 and HIV-1 Env somewhat correlates with the enhanced antiviral effect.",

HIV-1 virions were generated by cotransfecting HEK293T cells with BlaM-Vpr and HIV-1-NL4.3. Purified virus particles were used to infect SupT1 cells loaded with the BlaM-specific fluorescent substrate CCF2. Successful HIV-1 virion entry was detected by measuring BlaM cleavage of CCF2, which shifts CCF2 fluorescence emission from 520 nm (green) to 447 nm (blue) (Fig 4A). The virion fusion assay results demonstrate that the ability of IFITM to restrict HIV-1 entry is conserved in nonhuman primate IFITMs, particularly IFITM3 (Fig 4A and 4B).",

We next asked if there were any differences between primate IFITM restriction of cell-to-cell spread of HIV-1 (Fig 5). This was important, because HIV-1 entry appeared not to be dramatically affected by the various IFITMs tested (Fig 4). We utilized a method previously described in [54] that relies on an intron-regulated guassia luciferase (inGLuc) reporter gene that is expressed upon successful HIV infection of target cells [55]. Note that this assay measures only one-round of HIV-1 infection because it is based on an HIV-1 NL4.3 lentiviral vector. Donor Jurkat-inGLuc cells, either expressing or not expressing IFITMs, were infected with HIV-1 NL4.3 bearing VSV-G; 12 h post-infection, half of the cells were used to produce virus for cell-free infection while the other half were used for co-culture with target SupT1 cells expressing or not expressing IFITMs. Human IFITMs showed the greatest restriction (7-fold decrease for IFITM3) of HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread when human IFITM was expressed in both the target and donor cells (Fig 5A\u20135C) [28, 29, 53]. Notably, while a similar trend was seen for nonhuman primate IFITMs (Fig 5A\u20135C), there was a 21-fold decrease in HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread when both donor and target cells expressed OWM IFITM3 (3-fold greater compared to human IFITM3) (Fig 5A). These results show that nonhuman primate IFITMs share similar, perhaps modestly enhanced, cell-to-cell restriction of HIV-1 infection as those of human IFITMs.",

As shown in Fig 5D, the NL4.3 replication peaked on day 10 in both empty vector and human IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells, whereas two nonhuman primate IFITM1 delayed the peak to day 14. Of note, human IFITM1 exhibited roughly half the viral production of empty vector control, consistent with the notion that its inhibitory effect on HIV-1 NL4.3 replication is modest [29]. We also found that the L\u2019Hoest\u2019s OWM IFITM1 had a lower peak value compared to the gorilla counterpart (Fig 5D). When IFITM3 protein was compared, we observed a peak shift of viral replication from day 10 to day 14 for both human and gorilla IFITM3 (Fig 5E). Strikingly, HIV-1 replication in L\u2019Hoest\u2019s OWM IFITM3-expressing cells did not peak even after day 18 (Fig 5E). Overall, our results demonstrate that IFITM inhibition of HIV-1 replication is evolutionarily conserved, and that nonhuman primate IFITMs are more potent to inhibit HIV-1 replication than that those of human counterparts.",

Gorilla IFITM3 was knocked down using a lentiviral small hairpin RNA against IFITM3. Expression of gorilla IFITM3 was reduced compared to that of a non-specific control shRNA (Fig 6A). Gorilla cells were infected with HIV-1 NL4.3 psuedotyped with VSV-G to ensure entry. After a single round of replication, supernatants containing newly generated virus were harvested and examined for RT activity and by infecting HeLa-TZM-bl cells (Fig 6B and 6C, respectively). There was more than a 2-fold increase in RT activity of viral supernatants from IFITM3 knockdown cells (Fig 6B). Consistently, the infectivity of produced virus was also increased when gorilla IFITM3 was knocked down (Fig 6C). These results support the conclusion that the ability of endogenous nonhuman primate IFITMs to restrict lentiviruses is ancestrally conserved.",

Nucleotide substitutions that result in a change in the amino acid sequence are referred to as nonsynonymous (dN) while silent changes are considered synonymous (dS). A ratio of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) can be used to detect for positive, neutral, or purifying selection (also referred to as negative selection) [56]. To infer what type of selective pressure the IFITM proteins were under, we analyzed 9 primate IFITM1 or 9 primate IFITM3 sequences, including those of AGM we recently described [49] using Datamonkey [57\u201359] (Table 2) and MEGA6 software [44] (S1 Fig). In both cases, analysis of nucleotide sequences from IFITM1 and IFITM3 showed that the values of dN were much less than dS. Expanding the primate IFITM sequences to include additional IFITMs of other species from GenBank yielded similar results (data not shown), suggesting that IFITM proteins are under purifying selection (Table 2 and S1 Fig). Taken together, these results suggest that the primary amino acid sequence of the IFITM proteins are crucial for their biological functions and that most nonsynonymous changes could be deleterious to IFITMs.",

For example, the restriction factors TRIM5\u03b1, Tehterin, APOBEC3G, SAMHD1, and Viperin are all interferon inducible, restrict lentiviruses, and have undergone positive selection as a result of competing with viral antagonists [60\u201364].",

Herein, we show that primate IFITMs have undergone purifying or negative selection suggesting that primate IFITMs are atypical restriction factors that are not directly antagonized by viruses. In this study, we determined the sequence for 14 new nonhuman primate IFITMs from Gorilla, L\u2019Hoest\u2019s, Moustached, Sykes, Mangabey, Mandrill, and Guereza and demonstrated that primate IFITMs have undergone purifying selection rather than positive selection. Negative selection of primate IFITMs would suggest they have not been highly antagonized by viruses; to date there are no known viral antagonists that directly target the IFITMs. These results may suggest that the primate IFITMs contain an ancient primary function that is not involved in viral restriction. Indeed, IFITMs have been implicated in several cellular functions including immunity, germ cell development, cell adhesion, oncogenesis, bone mineralization, proliferation and cell death [21, 65\u201368]. Furthermore, in the absence of IFN, IFITM proteins have been shown to be basally expressed in cells (including gorilla fibroblasts, Fig 6A) [65].",

Our observations show that nonhuman primate IFITMs are capable of restricting both HIV and SIV. Interestingly, some nonhuman primate IFITMs derived from OWMs appeared to be more efficient restricting both HIV and SIV compared to that of their human counterparts. For instance, IFITM3agm was more restrictive against SIVagm and HIV compared to human IFITM3, and this could be related to the conserved yet differential interactions between IFITM3 and primate lentivirus envelope proteins. These trends may imply that some adaptions of the primate lentiviruses have occurred although it is unclear whether these are direct or indirect methods of escape. Alternatively, IFITMs have been shown to contain additional functions such as altering membrane fluidity [19]. It may be that an alternative primary function of the IFITMs indirectly affects viral entry.",

These observations are in close agreement with some earlier studies [15, 50].

Interestingly, we found that IFTIM restriction against HIV-2 was nearly equivalent across all species of IFITM tested (about 2-fold reduction).

We sought to determine if there was a particular stage during the HIV-1 life cycle in which nonhuman primate IFITMs inhibit HIV-1 compared to that of human IFITMs. Previously, our lab determined that human IFITMs restrict HIV-1 in part by antagonizing HIV-1 envelope [29]. In this work we found that interaction of envelope with OWM (L\u2019Hoest\u2019s) IFITM3 was conserved (Fig 3). However, only a slight increase (about 20%) in binding efficiency between OWM IFITM3 and HIV-1 envelope was observed (Fig 3). However, cell-to-cell transmission data clearly demonstrated that OWM IFITM3 is more efficient than human IFITM3 to reduce HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread and prolonged viral replication (Fig 5). These results together suggest that the main step of IFITM mediated restriction of HIV-1 occurs in the viral producer cells and is during cell-to-cell spread. It should be noted that the efficiency of HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection and replication in the presence of IFITMs are sometimes cell-type dependent [29].",

            "text": "While the various primate IFITMs are closely related and share a high degree of homology, there are several differences at the amino acid level that could account for stronger restrictive properties of some nonhuman primate IFITMs (S2 Fig). During purifying selection, changes that are deleterious to the gene function are removed from a population. In contrast, rare polymorphisms that present advantages to the population can occur and be preserved [70]. Though further investigation is needed, it is likely that polymorphisms in the IFITMs are responsible for their varying degrees of viral restriction [36, 71, 72]. It may also be that HIV/SIV Env has undergone positive selection that allows it to partially escape IFITM restriction to varying degrees [29, 51]. To date, no known viral accessory gene(s) have been identified to specifically antagonize the IFITM proteins [50], which could explain why primate IFITMs are under purifying selection. Hence, it is likely that the differential restrictions of IFITMs lie in the functional interactions between IFITM and primate lentivirus Env proteins. Indeed, we show here that human IFITMs are capable of interacting with HIV-1 envelope and that this interaction is evolutionarily conserved for OWM IFITM3 (Fig 3). More work is needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism(s) of IFITM restriction as well as viral countermeasures.",
