            "text": "Skeletal muscle is a highly complex and heterogeneous tissue, and serves several important metabolic functions (Bentzinger et al., 2012). In domestic animal, skeletal muscle is the largest contributor to mass and is therefore directly related to meat production (G\u00fceller and Russell, 2010). Muscle mass depends on the number of muscle fibers and muscle hypertrophy. The number of muscle fiber is set at the time of birth, and this limitation can only be partially compensated by muscle hypertrophy after birth (Wigmore and Stickland, 1983; Ylih\u00e4rsil\u00e4 et al., 2007). Thus, embryonic myogenesis is a crucial process for increasing muscle mass.",

In chicken, skeletal muscle form in the limb from progenitor cells during embryogenesis. These progenitor cells are originated from somites and migrate into the limb bud. Subsequently, they proliferate and differentiate into skeletal muscle in limb (Buckingham et al., 2003). Numerous regulatory genes involved in myogenesis have been identified, such as Myf5 (myogenic factor 5), MyoD (myogenic differentiation 1), Mrf4 (myogenic regulatory factor 4) MyoG (myogenin), MEF2 (myocyte enhancer binding factor 2), Myostatin, IGF2 (insulin-like growth factors 2), PAX3 (paired box 3), and PAX7 (paired box 7) (Bismuth and Relaix, 2010; Braun and Gautel, 2011). However, the regulations of skeletal muscle development in the chicken are far from clear, more genes or proteins, and non-coding RNAs and their interactions need to further elucidate. Our previous study identified differentially expressed chicken mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) during embryonic skeletal muscle development, and provides a functional interaction network between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes (Li et al., 2017). However, proteins and mRNA levels do not often directly correlate and proteins also provides post-translational modified information and more direct evidence (Greenbaum et al., 2003; Zhan et al., 2016). Thus, we aimed to assess the protein expression profiles during embryonic skeletal muscle development for this study.",

In this study, we performed iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis using embryonic muscle samples, and identified differentially expressed proteins during skeletal muscle development in chickens.

Total proteins (50 \u03bcg) were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked in 5% BSA blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as follows: MYL1 (ab97427, diluted 1:500), MYL3 (ab137767, diluted 1:1,000), RPL4 (ab154907, diluted 1:1,000), STMN1(ab194670, diluted 1:1,000), RPS3A (ab101690, diluted 1:500), and TNNT3 (ab82784, diluted 1:500). After that, the membrane was washed with PBS-T and then developed with anti-mouse or rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, diluted 1:5,000). Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (GE Healthcare, USA) and quantified with an ImageQuant LAS4000 system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).",

Skeletal muscle is an essential component of the animal body and its mass directly correlates with meat production (G\u00fceller and Russell, 2010). Numerous studies have been identified proteome changes of skeletal muscle at different growth stages in chickens (Doherty et al., 2004; Teltathum and Mekchay, 2009; Liu et al., 2016b), pigs (Long et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016), cattle (Zhang et al., 2010), and rats (Sp\u00e1cilov\u00e1 et al., 2016). Embryonic myogenesis involves in a series of complex biological process, which is a major determinant of muscle mass (Buckingham, 2001). Chicken skeletal muscle also offers an excellent system for developmental proteomics. However, for chicken skeletal muscle, previous proteomic analyses concentrated on days post hatching. For example, Doherty et al. characterized the proteome of layer chicken breast muscle at specified time-points from 1 to 27 days after hatching (Doherty et al., 2004). Protein expression profiles were also performed in the breast muscle of Thai indigenous chickens at 0, 3, 6, and 18 weeks of age and Beijing-You chickens at ages 1, 56, 98, and 140 days (Teltathum and Mekchay, 2009; Liu et al., 2016b). In this study, we performed an iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of chicken skeletal muscle at E11, E16, and D1, so we could focus on myogenesis during embryonic development. In the chick, fetal myoblasts are most abundant from E8 to E12, and undergo massive differentiation at E16 to E18 (Hartley et al., 1992; Stockdale, 1992).",

We identified 3,240 proteins and 491 of them were differentially expressed between the three developmental ages in leg muscle. The greatest numbers of differentially expressed proteins was in the E11 vs. D1 (n = 465) group, and interaction work of these proteins were found clusters for ribosomal structural proteins (protein synthesis), muscle contraction (specific muscle function), pyruvate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (energy generation). These results could provide new clues for genetic regulation of embryonic myogenesis.",

Ribosomal proteins have been reported that participated in regulation of mRNA translation during myogenesis (de Klerk et al., 2015). In breast muscle of Beijing-You chickens, ribosome-related functional modules were also found in interaction networks of the differentially expressed proteins at days 1, 56, 98, and 140 days (Liu et al., 2016b). We found that all these differentially expressed ribosomal proteins were down-regulated at D1. The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system is responsible for providing the bulk of cellular ATP. More than 90% of the cells of ATP are synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria (Minai et al., 2008; Pejznochova et al., 2010). In this E11 vs. D1 group, the differentially expressed proteins NDUFA5, NDUFA12, NDUFB9, NDUFB10, NDUFS6, and NDUFS8 are all involved in oxidative phosphorylation and most were up-regulated at D1 (Figure 5A). This family of proteins was also represented in our interaction network of the 189 differentially expressed proteins that directly correlated with their corresponding mRNA levels (Figure 6).",

Myosin light chains (MYL1, MYL2, and MYL3) are components of the myosin complex, and could act as a molecular motor to provide the energy for muscle contraction (Dominguez et al., 1998). The TNNC1, TNNC2, TNNI1, and TNNI2 are important components of troponin-tropomyosin complex, which has been found play a crucial role in the regulation of muscle contraction (Farah and Reinach, 1995). The DMD gene encodes dystrophin, that is essential for the development and organization of myofibers in skeletal and cardiac muscles (Muntoni et al., 2003; Ghahramani Seno et al., 2010). All these proteins were up-regulated at D1. Interestingly, the proteins interaction network in Figure 6 were also involved in the pathway of muscle contraction, including TNNC1, TNNC2, TNNI2, TNNT3, MYL1, MYL2, MYL3, and DMD etc. The proteins DMD, MYL3, TNNI2, and TNNT3 were also identified in our lncRNA-proteins interaction network (Figure 7). The TNNI2 and TNNT3 is the putative cis-target of lnc00068445; DMD is the putative cis-target of lnc00005738; MYL3 is the putative cis-target of lnc00037615 and lnc00037619. These four proteins may regulated by their corresponding lncRNA and together take part in the regulation of muscle development.",
