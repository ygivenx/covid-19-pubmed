Dengue virus infection, one of the most important and mosquito-borne viral diseases, is considered a major public health problem in developing tropical and sub-tropical countries mainly in Asia, South America, and the Caribbean with major disease outbreaks and endemic every year [1]. Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) have been identified, with distinct genotypes within each serotype. Multiple virus serotypes have been found co-circulating in the hyperendemic regions in Southeast Asia and Pacific [1, 2]. Its single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA contains 5'- and 3'- untranslated regions (UTR) and a single open reading frame encoding for a single polyprotein that could be cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid [C], premembrane/membrane [prM/M], and envelope [E]) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).",

Positive association between DENV infection in mosquitoes and human has been found; human cases were reported at about one week after appearance of DENV-positive A. aegypti [4, 5]. A. aegypti can also pick up DENV from people showing no symptoms or oligo symptom, resulting in silent transmission [6]. Therefore, for dengue disease control, it is important to extend DENV surveillance in the human and mosquito populations to near points of care (POC)/point of needs (PON), generating early alert signals to prevent and/or control DENV epidemics and reducing the spread of DENV infection [7].",

            "text": "DENV causes different clinical signs in humans, from mild febrile illness (dengue fever, DF) to life-threatening condition such as hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [8, 9]. Early, accurate and rapid diagnosis of dengue is critical for confirmation of clinically suspected cases to ensure timely management of severe dengue disease [10]. A number of NS1 rapid diagnostic tests are commercially available to easily detect NS1 antigen, but they are not sensitive or specific enough [11\u201313]. During the acute phase of the illness when viremia levels are high, the viral RNA or soluble antigens can be easily detected [14]. For rapid and accurate diagnosis of dengue virus in early phases of acute infections, detection of DENV RNA is recommended as the most sensitive and specific method to diagnose dengue in the acute phase of the illness by WHO [9]. After the first developed nucleic acid detection test for dengue diagnosis over 20 years ago [15], there have been a number of RT-PCR assays for DENV detection and serotype identification with high sensitivity and specificity [16\u201320]. Combined with automated RNA extraction protocols, RT-PCR can potentially facilitate fast and accurate diagnosis of dengue suspected cases with a single sample obtained during the patient\u2019s first visit to the clinician. However, the requirement of a pre-PCR nucleic acids extraction step, an expensive and not easy to use thermal cycler, and a highly trained technician make PCR technology not accessible in resource-limited regions where dengue is endemic [10, 21]. Molecular diagnosis tools for dengue is still much needed at or near POC/PON, particularly for developing countries with limited public health resources.",

It offered great analytical and clinical performances for rapid detection of DENV in human serum; its clinical performance was comparable to that of the reference multiplex RT-PCR assay in studies testing samples collected in Sri Lanka and Taiwan [7, 26]. The field-deployable system includes one automated NA extraction device (taco mini Automatic Nucleic Acid Extraction System, taco mini; GeneReach) and one compact PCR device (POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer, POCKIT; GeneReach) in a durable suitcase for easy field deployment. The iiPCR system is unique in its employment of a single heating source in a thermally baffled device to drive Rayleigh-Bernard convection in a capillary tube, allowing the three steps of PCR (denaturation, annealing, and extension) to occur sequentially and continuously [27, 28]. Since the first report of the assay in 2012, many PCR/RT-iiPCRs on the POCKIT system have been validated for sensitive and specific detection of various parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens in animals and humans, including Plasmodium spp, Salmonella spp, influenza A virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome virus, Zika virus and dengue virus [7, 26, 29\u201332].",

A compact fully automated sample-to-answer system (POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser, POCKIT Central) is commercially available recently, in which modules in the existing semi-automated system (automated NA extraction and compact POCKIT PCR modules) were integrated with a liquid handling module. This device can be set up and run with minimal set-up time and steps to allow quick and easy detection of DENV in human at settings such as a local hospital laboratory or airport and in mosquitos for surveillance and monitoring of DENV. Therefore, the new assay has potential to enable timely early diagnosis of DENV infection, facilitating effective disease management and control particularly in regions of low medical resources. In addition, the system can facilitate monitoring of the mosquitos carrying DENV in the field to provide timely information for local government to take immediate measures to facilitate effective local management and control of dengue.",

Performance of such tests near POC/PON could help shift health service more to local levels, achieve disease diagnosis at early stages, and reduce costs and turn-around time, improving health management quality in under-reached communities. Currently, commercially available NS1 immunological test products are rapid and do not require trained personnel to detect DENV in both human and mosquitos [39]. However, they are reported as less sensitive than ELISA and may cross react with other flaviviruses [11\u201313]. Moreover, their sensitivities were relatively low on days 1 and 2 and after day 5 post-symptomatic onset in human, compared to that seen with the RT-PCR methods [40].",

The previously available pan-DENV RT-iiPCR/semi-automated PCR system enabled sensitive and specific molecular testing near POC/PON.

Compared to conventional PCR methods and to the semi-automated PCR system (see Fig 1 for procedures involved), the fully automated PCR system offers much shorter set up time; its capacity to process 8 reactions in one test run makes it suitable for applications at near-patient settings where the sample numbers are relatively small and a sophisticated testing procedure is not possible. Moreover, the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR reagent is available in a lyophilized format to facilitate shipment at ambient temperatures and storage at 2\u20138\u00b0C for at least 2 years, greatly reducing shipping and storage costs. Hence, this system can facilitate relatively inexpensive, rapid, and simple POC/PON detection of DENV in routine dengue diagnosis.",
