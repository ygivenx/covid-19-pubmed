Indoor climate control system issues, such as improvements in noise control, air quality, ventilation, and lighting conditions, are receiving increased attention. Therefore, hospital managers should seriously consider the possibility of renovating existing hospital facilities, installing an improved HVAC system, and other indoor climate control systems, to decrease the spread of infections and to upgrade the medical environment through sustainable building renovation.",

The building industry is one of the largest contributors to energy and material use worldwide [9]. In the commercial sector, energy use in hospitals accounts for 9% of the total consumption in USA, 11% in Spain, and 6% in UK, respectively. However, in terms of energy use intensity, hospital buildings are second only to restaurant buildings, and HVAC is the main end use with approximately half of the energy use in buildings [10]. Improving the energy efficiency of existing hospital buildings while maintaining high standards for the medical environments has been regarded as a priority for building renovation [11,12].",

Many studies have developed a number of methods and models for evaluating existing building conditions and supporting decisions pertaining to building renovation, such as TOBUS for offices [14,15], XENIOS for hotels [16], IEA Annex 36 for educational buildings [17], EPIQR and other decision making tools for residential buildings [18,19,20]. Some studies have proposed strategies to deal with waste pollution and diseases spread in built environments [21,22,23,24]. However, there are three notions particularly noteworthy from this previous research. First, most of these methods and models have not been tested for hospital building types; compared to other building types, the integration of facilities and equipment in hospitals is more complicated. Second, these methods and models have paid most attention to understanding or predicting energy usage for buildings. The discussion of applicable renovation strategies for improving building performance is relatively limited [14]. Third, there are many studies related to infection surveillance systems for healthcare in various countries [25,26,27], but many highly infectious diseases (HIDs) spread rapidly when infection control measures are poorly implemented [28]. Improvement and maintenance of healthcare facilities are crucial to minimize the problem of a major breakdown and to satisfy the end user [29].",

There can be several renovations of infill systems while the structure system is still in fine condition [30]. Adequate maintenance should be provided throughout the entire lifetime of a building to ensure that the building and its facilities meet the requirements stated by the users and specifications [31]. Periodic renovation can also provide opportunities to upgrade the internal and external environments, increase the value of existing buildings, provide more modern accommodations, and attract new owners or occupants [32]. Hospitals, compared to other building types, involve facilities and equipment that are relatively complicated. Furthermore, the emphasis on the integration of space operation and system functionality has increased the difficulty in managing these facilities and equipment. A systematic approach to managing these periodic maintenance and renovation activities is imperative. ",

In this study, sustainable renovation means upgrading or improving building facilities and equipment with regards to environmental sustainability and ensuring that the renovation strategies are cost-effective. The physical condition and space utilization condition assessments of building systems that are not directly related to environmental sustainability are excluded from this study when considering these sustainable renovation strategies. Table 1 shows a comparison of sustainable hospital building renovation criteria and the credits from LEED, BREEAM and GGHC. The focus of this study is to evaluate environmental conditions of existing buildings and to recommend an optimal scheme of sustainable renovation strategies. Therefore, criteria, such as, location, transportation, regional priority and innovation, are not considered in the research. Table 2, based on the Table 1, shows integrated criteria, sub-criteria, and assessment items for sustainable hospital building renovation.

Thirty current condition questions (assessment items) with basic building information are provided for the users to assess the current hospital building condition.

In order to quantify the quality of renovation strategies, improvement scores are also simply rated by three levels according to the renovation involvement. \u201cLow level\u201d means that taking these actions can lead to the full restoration to original designed functioning levels (the score of 1). For example, \u201ctap with water-efficiency\u201d had a score of 1 because it can reach the basic requirement of water conservation. \u201cMedium level\u201d means taking these actions can not only restore full function of facilities or equipment but also increase their service life or durable capacity (the score of 1.5) (e.g., the renovation can improve its functional performance superior to original designed function). For example, \u201ctap with automatic sensor\u201d had a score of 1.5 because it can achieve more water saving amount than \u201ctap with water-efficiency\u201d. \u201cHigh level\u201d means taking these actions can lead to the most sustainable benefits, such as energy saving, water conservation, and other benefits related to environmental sustainability, for the environment (the score of 2). For example, \u201ctap with water-efficiency and automatic sensor\u201d had a score of 2 because it combines two functions of tap water saving techniques, which can conserve much more water.",

Genetic algorithms (GA) now are well known by their great operations in combinatorial optimization [45]. However, one of the major drawbacks in a traditional GA is a random process, which generates the initial population for each chromosome [46], and each chromosome of traditional GA in the initial population is generated randomly. Previous experimental results have shown that the GA does not always result in good solutions due to the random method. The reason is that most of the randomly generated chromosomes have a poor total flowtime and thus pass unfavorable traits to their offspring [47].",

However, A* is not practical for many large-scale problems.

Rather than contributing to waste through the demolition of old buildings and the construction of new buildings, reusing buildings extends a building\u2019s life and facilitates environmental sustainability while providing social and economic benefits to the society [50,51]. In developed countries, 95%\u201397% of buildings are existing buildings. Reusing building structures, such as through refurbishments, infrastructure additions, or reconstruction, requires merely 50%\u201375% of the time and 50%\u201380% of the costs entailed in constructing new buildings [52]. Therefore, adaptive reuse of vacant buildings is an efficient way to use obsolete existing buildings by \u201crecycling\u201d them in-situ, thereby providing them a new functional purpose [53].",

            "text": "Combined with declining birth rates, societies around the world are now facing the challenges of declining birth rates combined with rapidly aging population [54]. In Taiwan, the birth rate in 2010 was the world\u2019s lowest [55]. As a result of this declining, the number of students there has also been decreasing each year. In fact, it is estimated that 30% of middle school spaces will be unoccupied by the end of 2028 [56]. The aging population in Asia is increasing, from 10% in 2009 to 30% in 2050. While healthcare service is essential for the well-being of elderly people in terms of personal care, nursing, life threatening illness, health consulting, and contingency help [57], transportation convenience should also be considered for elders [54,58]. As in societies and their governments worldwide, Taiwan should also prepare to support the growth of these trends [59]. Instead of large and teaching hospitals which are provided with interns, more sickbeds and long-term medical care, community hospitals provide short-term general specialist and hospitalization, including referral resource, first aid and emergency, hospitalization service, prevention and public education, and basic medical and public health service for surrounding communities. The needs of the society must be addressed for vacant public buildings conversion [60]. Complying with the tendency of declining birth rates and rapidly aging populations, the Taiwan government has actively proposed building reuse policies with respect to converting vacant public school buildings to other public facilities, such as community hospitals, in these years [61]. Middle schools in Taiwan, for example, are usually located within communities, and reusing these school buildings as they become vacant by converting them to public community hospitals is more convenient for elders and children who need more frequent general health examinations and medical treatments. Some classrooms in schools can be easily converted to medical consultation rooms and the others can be used for public medical education and service without demolition. Relevant projects are going to be conducted one after another.",

In the criterion of sustainable sites, the solutions suggested by the system cost more money than what hospital managers suggested because of high level actions for wall insulation technologies and eco-pavement. In the criterion of water efficiency, the hospital managers take a high level strategy for wastewater technologies that charges a costly budget, thereby increasing the total cost amount. In the criterion of energy, the system is adopting new green technology\u2014building energy management system which is classified to high level, while the hospital managers take no action to improve the energy performance. In the criterion of health and well-being, hospital managers are trying to choose actions to improve the occupant environment that also raise the budget. For example, hospital managers choose the window insulation strategy with a high cost. In the criterion of pollution and waste, the system pays attention to prevention of refrigerant leak, watercourse pollution, and night time light pollution while hospital managers only take into account of the first two sub-criteria. Therefore, the total score yielded by the system (40.5) is higher than that of the project decided by hospital managers (33.5), as shown in Table 5.",
