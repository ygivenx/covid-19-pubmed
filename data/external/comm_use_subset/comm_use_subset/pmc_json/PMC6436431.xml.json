            "text": "Malaria is one of the leading causes of morbidity affecting around 212 million individuals and 4, 29,000 deaths in endemic regions according to WHO 2015. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria with complications that include cerebral malaria, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, or severe anemia (Buffet et al., 2011; Das, 2008; Medana & Turner, 2006; Mohan, Sharma, & Bollineni, 2008). P. falciparum malaria is frequently associated with immunosuppression and increased secondary infections (Hu, 2013; Ihekwereme, Esimone, & Nwanegbo, 2014; Orf & Cunnington, 2015; Troye\u2010Blomberg & Perlmann, 1988). Immunosuppression enhances parasitemia and reduces immune responses to not only malaria parasite proteins but other pathogens as well. Accumulating evidence suggests that a combination of parasite and host factors is involved in the pathogenesis of severe malaria.",

            "text": "During the intra\u2010erythrocytic stages, P. falciparum parasites digest hemoglobin in the food vacuole, resulting in the production of potentially toxic heme metabolites (Francis, Sullivan, & Goldberg, 1997), which the parasite detoxifies by converting it to an insoluble crystal called malarial pigment or hemozoin (Hz) (Arese & Schwarzer, 1997). During schizogeny, Hz is released into blood and avidly phagocytosed by human phagocytic cells including monocytes (MO) (Shio, Kassa, Bellemare, & Olivier, 2010). As a result of Hz uptake, several functions of MO such as repeated phagocytosis (Schwarzer et al., 1992), bactericidal abilities (Fiori et al., 1993), oxidative burst, MHC Class II expression, antigen presentation (Scorza, Magez, Brys, & De Baetselier, 1999), and maturation to dendritic cells (Urban & Todryk, 2006) are severely affected. MO actively respond to ingested natural Hz by secretion of pro\u2010 and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20101RA, IL\u201010, IL\u20108, and chemokines, CCL2, CCL3 CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL5 (Deshpande & Shastry, 2004; Giribaldi et al., 2010). Hz stimulates IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and CCL3 production via NF\u2010\u03baB and p38 MAPK kinase in human MO (Polimeni et al., 2012). Purified Hz isolated from parasitized RBCs stimulates TLR9 signaling and induces production of cytokines\u2014TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, IL\u201012p40, CCL2 in MYD88\u2010dependent manner in murine spleen and dendritic cells (Coban et al., 2005). In murine MQ cell line B10R, NF\u2010\u03baB has been shown to be involved in chemokine production of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL2 induced by Hz (Jaramillo, Godbout, & Olivier, 2005). Hz\u2010induced activation of NOD\u2010like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 inflammasome and IL\u20101\u03b2 production is mediated through Src kinase Lyn and the tyrosine kinase Syk pathways in mice (Olivier, Van Den Ham, Shio, Kassa, & Fougeray, 2014; Shio et al., 2009).",

            "text": "MO are heterogeneous innate immune cells that play a pivotal role in primary response to pathogens, tissue homeostasis, inflammation, resolution, and repair (Shi & Pamer, 2011). MO are highly plastic and polarize toward M1 phenotype in the presence of inflammatory environment such as LPS and IFN\u03b3, while the anti\u2010inflammatory M2 phenotype is driven by TH2 cytokines IL\u20104, IL\u201013, IL\u201010, and TGF\u2010\u03b2. IL\u201012\u2010producing M1 phenotype is associated with antiparasitic and tumor\u2010resistance capabilities, and IL\u201010\u2010producing M2 phenotype is related to wound healing, immune regulation, and resolution of inflammation (Mantovani et al., 2004; Martinez & Gordon, 2014; Sica & Mantovani, 2012). M1 and M2 MO have an indirect role in the activation of Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively (Mantovani et al., 2004). A study by Murray et al. (2014) described different types of MQ phenotypes generated by different activating agents and referred to them as M(IL\u20104), M(Ig), M(IL\u201010), M(GC), M(IFN\u03b3), and M(LPS); however, a phenotype may not fall into specific categories but may show a spectra related to particular phenotype. The M2 phenotype displays high expression of mannose\u2010binding receptor CD206, high arginase activity, and low nitric oxide (NO) production (Gordon, 2003; Kobayashi et al., 2010; Mosser, 2003; Tsuchimoto et al., 2015). The M2 type MO are divided into M2a, M2b, and M2c subtypes that produce specific chemokines CCL17, CCL1, and CXCL13, respectively (Edwards, Zhang, Frauwirth, & Mosser, 2006; Mantovani et al., 2004; Sironi et al., 2006).",

The pathways may act individually or in combination to drive MO toward M2 polarization (Gordon & Martinez, 2010; Martinez & Gordon, 2014).The p38 MAPK and PI3K\u2010AKT pathway mediated IL\u20104\u2010induced M2a polarization in mice model (Jimenez\u2010Garcia, Herranz, Luque, & Hortelano, 2015). Notch1 signaling via NF\u2010\u03baB, p38 MAPK, and AKT pathways has been demonstrated in M2b polarization of murine lupus mouse model (Zhang, Xu, & Xiong, 2010). Recent studies have enhanced our understanding and importance of phenotypic changes in MO by modulating immune responses in several infectious diseases (Buchacher, Ohradanova\u2010Repic, Stockinger, Fischer, & Weber, 2015; Kobayashi et al., 2010; Nakamura, Ito, Kobayashi, Herndon, & Suzuki, 2015; Tsuchimoto et al., 2015) and highlighted their potential for development of new therapeutics. Phenotypic changes in MO have been reported in parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis, filariasis, and trypanosomiasis (Babu et al., 2009; Cabal\u00e9n et al., 2016).",

Briefly, P. falciparum (3D7 strain; MR4/ATCC, mycoplasma free) culture was maintained in candle jars at 37\u00b0C (Trager & Jensen, 1976). Parasites were cultured in O\u2010positive RBCs at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 4.5 g/L glucose and 2.1 g/L NaHCO3, 0.5% AlbuMAX II (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and gentamicin (50 mg/ml). The medium was replenished every 24 h. Parasite cultures with >25% rings were synchronized by 5% aqueous sorbitol and cultured for 50 h until the rupture of mature schizonts and release of Hz. Culture supernatants containing Hz were carefully aspirated and collected and centrifuged, and the blackish\u2010brown Hz\u2010containing pellet was washed three times with sterile ice cold PBS (pH 7.2). Pigment isolated from different batches of parasite cultures was pooled, aliquoted, and stored in PBS at \u221220\u00b0C. The total heme content in isolated Hz was determined as previously described (Polimeni et al., 2012). Hz isolated from the supernatants of synchronized parasite cultures after schizont rupture is mostly devoid of parasite material.

            "text": "The effect of Hz on activation of MO toward the M2 phenotype was examined in CD14+ sorted cells and analyzed for a panel of M1\u2010 and M2\u2010associated markers. IL\u201010, a well\u2010characterized anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine implicated in M2 polarization, was elevated at transcript level following Hz exposure (Figure 1a). Consistent with our previous work (Deshpande & Shastry, 2004), a strong induction of secreted and cellular IL\u201010 was observed (Figure 1b and Supporting Information Figure S3a). The transcript and secreted level of IL\u201012p70 was assessed in Hz\u2010fed MO, and treatment with LPS + IFN\u03b3 was used as positive control. Interestingly, Hz phagocytosis did not alter the IL\u201012p70 level. As expected, the production of IL\u201012 was increased in MO exposed to LPS + IFN\u03b3 (Supporting Information Figure S3b,c). M1 phenotype is also induced by microbial products through TLR ligands (Murray & Wynn, 2011; Murray et al., 2014; Wang, Liang, & Zen, 2014). Therefore, additional experiments were conducted to examine TLR engagement in Hz\u2010driven MO activation. MO exposed to natural Hz were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blotting for expression of TLR9. \u03b2\u2010Hematin (sHz) was used as a reference for flow cytometry analysis (Coban et al., 2005). As shown in Supporting Information Figure S4a,b, natural Hz had no effect on TLR9 expression, suggesting that it might not be involved in Hz\u2010mediated MO activation. In this study, MO fed with Hz displayed strong upregulation of mannose\u2010binding lectin receptor (CD206), a M2\u2010associated surface marker with increase in percent positive cells and MFI in comparison with controls (Figure 1c). HLA\u2010DR, a M1 phenotype\u2010related marker, was significantly down\u2010regulated as observed by decrease of MFI in response to Hz exposure (Figure 1c). Recent reports employing differential gene expression and chemokine profiles have ascribed three subtypes in the M2 phenotype. To identify the M2 subtypes generated following Hz phagocytosis, we assessed the expression of subset\u2010specific chemokines\u2014CCL17 (M2a), CCL1 (M2b), and CXCL13 (M2c). Hz\u2010fed MO robustly elevated transcript level of CCL17 and CCL1 (Figure 1d). Also, a significant increase in secreted chemokines was observed for CCL17 and CCL1 in supernatants of Hz\u2010fed MO (Figure 1e). In addition, Hz phagocytosis elevated transcript level and secretion of M2b\u2010associated cytokines\u2014TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101 \u03b2, and IL\u20106 (Supporting Information Figure S5a,b). The amount of Hz in the range of 25\u201375\u03bcg/ml significantly elevated the secreted levels of IL\u201010, CCL17, CCL1, and surface expression of CD206 in MO (Supporting Information Figure S5c). Interestingly, CXCL13 and CD163 (markers related to M2c phenotype) were unaltered under similar experimental conditions (Supporting Information Figure S6).",

In this study, exposure to Hz led to a significant surge in the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK (pP38\u2010Y182), PI3K\u2010AKT (pAKT\u2010S473), and NF\u2010\u03baB (p P65\u2010S276) in MO, indicating the activation of these pathways. Moreover, the decrease in I\u03baB\u03b1 further confirmed the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB (Figure 2a and Supporting Information Figure S7). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibitors of these pathways, SB203580 (p38 MAPK), parthenolide (NF\u2010\u03baB p65), and LY294002 (PI3K\u2010AKT) dramatically down\u2010regulated the expression and secretion of IL\u201010 (Figure 2b,c), implicating the involvement of these pathways in Hz\u2010induced IL\u201010 production in MO. Furthermore, we observed significant attenuation of M2\u2010associated CCL17 and CCL1 at the transcript and secreted levels in Hz\u2010fed MO pretreated with SB203580 (SB), parthenolide (PAR), and LY294002(LY) (Figure 2d,e). Moreover, decrease in surface expression of CD206 with reduction in percent positive cells and MFI corroborates the results of chemokine profiles confirming attenuation of M2\u2010like phenotype by the inhibitors (Figure 2f). The levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106 were markedly reduced with Hz in the presence of SB203580 and parthenolide. In contrast, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106 cytokines were further elevated in presence of LY294002 (Supporting Information Figure S8a,b). LY294002 can act on other pathways along with PI3K kinases that may be responsible for the regulation of IL\u20106 and IL\u20101\u03b2 (Gharbi et al., 2007). To confirm the role of PI3K\u2010AKT pathway, we used another inhibitor\u2014wortmannin in similar experiments. Wortmannin effectively reduced the level of IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, and IL\u201010 in supernatants of MO fed with Hz, signifying the role of PI3K\u2010AKT pathway in inhibiting M2\u2010like phenotype (Supporting Information Figure S8c).",

ART in concentrations ranging from 5 to 400 \u03bcM did not affect the viability of MO as assessed for cytotoxicity by MTT assay (Supporting Information Figure S9a). In our study, we found that treatment of MO preexposed to Hz with ART resulted in dramatic reduction of IL\u201010 levels (Figure 3a) and expression of the surface marker CD206 in terms of percent positive cells and MFI (Figure 3b). ART also exhibited the ability to significantly diminish secretion of other M2 cytokines\u2014CCL17, CCL1, IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20101\u03b2 (Figure S9b)\u2014but did not significantly alter arginase activity, NO, and ROS production (Figure 3c\u2013e). Importantly, ART partially reversed Hz\u2010induced immunosuppression as demonstrated by partial restoration of mitogen\u2010stimulated lymphocyte proliferation (Figure 3f). ART in the dose range of 5\u201320 \u03bcM decreased secretion of phenotypic markers IL\u201010, CCL17, CCL1, and CD206 surface expression in Hz\u2010fed MO (Supporting Information Figure S9c). The Hz\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB activation was inhibited by ART as indicated by decreased p65 phosphorylation and increased I\u03baB\u03b1 in MO (Supporting Information Figure S9d).

CHQ showed similar effect on the Hz\u2010driven M2\u2010like phenotype in MO, inhibited NF\u2010\u03baB p65 phosphorylation, and increased I\u03baB\u03b1 levels (Figure 4a\u2013f and Supporting Information Figure S10).

Hence, studies on interactions between host and parasite components are important to provide a better understanding of factors affecting directionality of immune response. MO, an important constituent of mononuclear phagocytic system, plays an important role during parasite infection.

Findings from our study demonstrate that Hz drives human MO toward M2\u2010like phenotype, as characterized by the expression of phenotypic markers including elevated IL\u201010, mannose receptor expression CD206, and arginase activity. Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like MO comprise of M2a and M2b subtypes based on the expression of CCL17 and CCL1. Since chemokines, CCL17 and CCL1, function as agonists for CCR4 and CCR8 receptors, respectively (Mantovani et al., 2004), it is likely that Hz might facilitate recruitment of CCR4 and CCR8\u2010bearing TH2 cells and regulatory T cells of TH2 immunity which contribute to immunosuppression. It is noteworthy in this context that regulatory T cells suppress T\u2010cell responses in malaria (Hisaeda et al., 2004). Furthermore, Hz induces production of M2b\u2010specific cytokines\u2014TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106 in human MO. These data corroborate with reports demonstrating the presence of inflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20106 along with high level of anti\u2010inflammatory IL\u201010 in plasma of malaria patients (Perera et al., 2013; Weinberg et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Functionally, M1\u2010type MO are characterized by elevated production of NO and ROI that are essential for clearance of pathogens (Mantovani et al., 2004). Conversely, M2\u2010type MO express high arginase activity which is due to production of arginase\u20101, the enzyme that converts arginine to ornithine and urea causing depletion of arginine and reduction of NO (Biswas & Mantovani, 2012; Galv\u00e1n\u2010Pe\u00f1a & O'Neill, 2014; Martinez & Gordon, 2014). In malaria, depletion of NO results in low NO bioavailability that affects adherence of parasites to endothelium and is associated with severity of the disease. High arginase activity and an inverse relation between disease severity and NO production are recently reported in malaria (Weinberg et al., 2016). In this context, MO fed with Hz demonstrate elevated arginase activity compared with untreated and latex\u2010ingested MO. These data along with the findings from studies that plasmodium parasites (Olszewski et al., 2009) and lysed infected erythrocytes (Reiter et al., 2002) release arginase suggest that cumulative elevation of arginase activity from these sources might contribute to M2\u2010like activity. Recent studies have reported Hz\u2010induced production of ROS (Jaramillo et al., 2005) and NO (Jaramillo, Gowda, Radzioch, & Olivier, 2003) in MO. In contrast to these reports, we found that Hz significantly reduced production of NO and ROS levels compared with untreated and latex\u2010ingested MO. The difference in the results may be attributed to the nature of Hz used; while the earlier studies were performed with delipidized Hz and \u03b2\u2010hematin, our experiments were conducted with natural Hz. In addition, mitogen\u2010stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was significantly suppressed in the presence of Hz\u2010fed MO compared with control and latex\u2010ingested MO. This observation is in agreement with the study that malaria patients have suppressed T\u2010 and B\u2010cell functions (Zander & Butler, 2013).",

In this study, Hz activated p38 MAPK, PI3K\u2010AKT, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways and pharmacological inhibitors for these pathways dramatically down\u2010regulated the expression and secretion of IL\u201010, thus, over\u2010riding the induction triggered by Hz exposure. In line with this observation, the inhibitors effectively reduced Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like phenotypic, biochemical, and functional properties. While these findings implicate the role of p38 MAPK, PI3K\u2010AKT, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways, we cannot rule out the possibility of other signaling pathways in Hz\u2010driven activation of MO toward M2 phenotype. Since Hz does not induce a specific phenotype subset but drives the MO toward M2a and M2b types, it may be postulated that Hz stimulates atypical activation mediated through PI3K\u2010AKT, p38 MAPK, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways.",

            "text": "We next aimed to identify strategies that could aid in reversing the effect of Hz in driving the MO to an M2\u2010like phenotype. In this regard, we conducted experiments with CHQ and ART for three reasons; first, they are reported to inhibit pathways crucial for polarization to M2 type; second, they are widely used for treatment of malaria; and third, they possess immunomodulatory properties. ART have been reported to decrease IL\u201010, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels (Shakir, Hussain, Javeed, Ashraf, & Riaz, 2011; Wu et al., 2016) through MAPK (Wang et al., 2009), NF\u2010\u03baB (Prato, Gallo, Giribaldi, Aldieri, & Arese, 2010; Wang et al., 2011), and PI3K\u2010AKT (Kim et al., 2013) pathways. CHQ has also been demonstrated to act through MAPK (Kono et al., 2008; Weber, Chen, & Levitz, 2002) and NF\u2010\u03baB(Long, Liu, Wang, Zhou, & Zheng, 2015; Yang et al., 2013) pathways and decrease IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in mononuclear phagocytes in different diseases (Jang et al., 2006; Long et al., 2015). In another study, CHQ has been shown to be an effective anticancer drug in mice by inhibiting tumor resistant MQ (M2 MQ) and decreasing TGF\u2010\u03b2 and IL\u201010 production. The effect was accompanied by decreased myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells (MDSC), Tregs, and increasing CD8+ T cells in tumor milieu (Zhang et al., 2017). The ability of these drugs to inhibit crucial pathways and production of cytokines/chemokines that are signature for M2 type MO has extended their use for other parasitic diseases, rheumatic diseases, and cancer. In our study, the drugs were found to be more effective in reducing the expression of phenotypic markers\u2014cytokines, chemokines, and surface marker\u2014CD206 associated with M2\u2010like phenotype than reversing altered biochemical and functional properties. ART did not reverse arginase activity in Hz\u2010fed MO. Our finding is supported by an earlier report that ART did not significantly alter arginase activity in leishmania donovani\u2010infected MQ though it enhanced protective immune responses by reversing NO levels (Sen, Ganguly, Saha, & Chatterjee, 2010). These observations are not surprising as CHQ and ART are known for their antimalarial action through multiple modes on their target, but their mechanism of action as immunomodulators is not clearly elucidated. The M2 phenotype is previously related to abnormal autophagy and angiogenesis (Li et al., 2016). We speculate that CHQ, a known autophagy inhibitor, may attenuate Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like MO activation by inhibiting autophagy. Previously, falciparum malaria pathogenesis has been related to upregulated angiogenic factors VEGF, Ang\u20102, and sFLT\u20101 along with dysregulated and excessive immune responses (Muehlenbachs, Mutabingwa, Edmonds, Fried, & Duffy, 2006; Silver, Higgins, McDonald, & Kain, 2010). The antiparasitic action of ART is accompanied with disruption of parasite proteins, alteration of mitochondrial functions, and angiogenesis (Ak, 2015; Shakir et al., 2011). In relation to ability of M2 phenotype to stimulate angiogenesis, ART may attenuate Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like phenotype by altering the release of angiogenic factors.",
