Different viral species are associated with one of two disease syndromes: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) [1]. Hantaan virus (HTNV), primarily found in Asia, is among the most prevalent HFRS-causing hantaviruses with a case fatality rate of between 1\u201315% [2]. Puumala virus (PUUV) causes most HFRS cases in Europe, though its case fatality rate is lower at <1% [3, 4]. There are currently no FDA licensed vaccines or therapeutics for either HFRS or HPS [5].",

Andes virus (ANDV), an HPS-causing hantavirus, causes lethal disease in immunocompetent hamsters [6], while numerous other HPS-causing hantaviruses including Sin Nombre Virus (SNV) and Choclo virus cause lethal disease in hamsters immunosuppressed with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide [7, 8]. In contrast to HPS-causing hantaviruses, exposure of hamsters to HFRS-causing hantaviruses such as HTNV, PUUV, Dobrava (DOBV) and Seoul (SEOV) leads to asymptomatic infection, despite viral dissemination, even when immunosuppressed (Hooper Lab, unpublished data) [8\u201311]. In these studies hamsters were exposed to high doses of HTNV and PUUV, far exceeding the infectious dose 99% (ID99) for the virus. Development and characterization of a uniformly infective, low-dose challenge model, enhances the hamster model\u2019s usefulness in vaccine and therapeutic testing. In this report we present a low-dose hamster infection model for both HTNV and PUUV infected animals.",

In addition, they have recently been described as a disease model of two hemorrhagic fever viruses, Bundibugyo virus and Ebola virus [16, 17], supporting viral replication without prior adaptation. Most hantavirus-related human disease occurs by aerosolized transmission of the virus from the excreta or secreta of infected rodents [18, 19], a model of viral infection for which the ferret is well suited. In this study we demonstrate that ferrets are capable of being infected by high titers of HTNV and PUUV, though aside from gradual weight loss infected animals exhibit no clinical symptoms or impaired renal function.",

However, the macaques\u2019 large size and cost limits their usefulness in therapeutic studies, especially when test article availability is limited, as is often the case in passive transfer studies. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is becoming more popular for infectious disease studies. Its genetic similarity to humans, cost, relative safety, and small size make it an attractive alternative to traditional non-human primate species [21]. Marmosets have been used as a disease model for other viral agents including Dengue virus [22], Hepatitis C virus [23], influenza virus [24], Lassa fever virus [25], orthopox viruses [26\u201328], Rift Valley Fever virus [29], Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus [30], and filoviruses [31]. In this study we demonstrate that exposure of marmosets to HTNV leads to asymptomatic infection characterized by high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This is the first report of hantavirus infection in marmosets.",

First, heat-inactivated sera was diluted 1:10, followed by five-fold serial dilutions that were mixed with an equal volume of Eagle\u2032s minimum essential medium with Earle\u2032s salts and 10% fetal bovine sera containing 4000 fluorescent focus units of Hantaan pseudovirions. This mixture was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Following this incubation, 50 \u03bcl was inoculated onto Vero cell monolayers in a clear bottom, black-walled 96-well plate in duplicate. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18\u201324 hr. The media was discarded and cells were lysed according to the luciferase kit protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). A Tecan M200 Pro was used to acquire luciferase data. The values were graphed using GraphPad Prism (version 7) and used to calculate the percent neutralization normalized to cells alone and pseudovirions alone as the minimum and maximum signals, respectively. The percent neutralization values for duplicate serial dilutions were plotted. Fifty percent PsVNA (PsVNA50) titers were interpolated from 4-parameter curves, and geometric mean titers were calculated.",

Also similar is that the challenge dose of ANDV required to infect/kill 50% of hamsters by the i.n. or intragastric route is ~10\u201330 fold higher [56]. Previous reports also demonstrate that PUUV is capable of infecting hamsters by the intragastric route, with an ID50 of >10,000, making it a much less effective route of infection [57]. Despite similarities in their ID50\u2019s, the ID99\u2019s of HTNV and PUUV greatly diverge, with ~200 times less HTNV required to infect hamsters via the i.m. route, and ~2 fold less required to infect via the i.n. route (Table 1).

Asymptomatic infection of hamsters with SNV repeatedly passaged through hamsters has a similar organ distribution [58]. The organ distribution of both those viruses is similar to the low dose HTNV hamster model, with two notable exceptions. First, the HTNV model has low, transient levels of virus in the liver and hardly any virus in the spleen (Figs 3 and 4). This dissimilarity between the models led us to confirm the lack of virus in the spleen was not due to the presence of inhibitors by spiking either infectious virus or viral RNA into samples prior to evaluation (S2 Fig). Second, in the ANDV model, the presence of virus was determined by plaque assay, indicating the virus was infectious and replication competent. In the HTNV low dose hamster model, while there is detection of high levels of viral genome (and in the case of the HTNV i.m. model, by pathology) by RT-PCR, recovery of infectious virus is sporadic, typically occurring at low levels, in only a few hamsters per time point (Figs 3 and 4, Table 1). The discrepancy between RT-PCR/pathology and plaque assay is notable. The hamsters in this study were not perfused, and given the appearance of neutralizing antibodies as early as day XX post infection, the presence of these antibodies could be impairing out ability to recover live virus via the plaque assay. It is also possible that viral packaging is somehow impaired in the hamster, leading to a larger amounts of nucleocapsid protein and viral genome than live virus. Further studies need to be undertaken to elucidate.",

In neither case was serum viremia observed (Figs 3 and 4). This is most similar to the SNV models involving low passage virus in immunocompetent hamsters: the virus is transiently detected in the lung by PCR, and then sporadically found in organs 12 to 14 days post infection using immunohistochemistry [41, 58]. The distribution of PUUV in the hamster differs somewhat from its host species the bank vole, where it is found to persist in the lung, spleen and kidney, and was not detected in the heart or the brain [62].",

For a 10 PFU HTNV i.m. challenge, given lower titer and specific OD sum values as compared with higher challenge doses, and the fact that one hamster with significant viral genome in its organs at Day 28 post infection (7.1 log10 in the brain, and 6.8 log10 in the kidney) did not seroconvert, waiting until Day 35 post infection to monitor seroconversion is advisable (Figs 1\u20133). Viral load in the brain, kidney, and lungs as measured by RT-PCR need to be evaluated at Day 35 post low-dose challenge to determine their usefulness as secondary endpoints. Recovery of infectious virus in any organ, and viremia are too sporadic to serve as proxy markers for infection.",

In comparison to the hamster, the ferret is far more resistant to HTNV and PUUV infection. Exposure of ferrets to 2,000 PFU i.n. (greater than the ID99 for both viruses in hamsters), failed to result in a productive infection and seroconversion. Instead i.m. challenge doses of ~100,000\u2013200,000 PFU were needed (Fig 5). Initially ferrets were exposed to PUUV K27, a commonly used laboratory isolate that has been in cell culture for over 15 years. Repeated passaging of hantavirus is known to cause mutations [63\u201365]. In contrast PUUV Beaumont and Seloignes are relatively recent isolates, with no more than 3 passages in cell culture post isolation. These strains were used for all subsequent experiments to maximize the likelihood of PUUV to cause disease by eliminating possible attenuation of the laboratory strain of the virus. Despite the high challenge dose and use of recent isolates, no elevation in white blood cells was observed over the course of the experiment, no pathology or organ burden was detected at the conclusion of the experiment, and the N-ELISA specific OD sum, PRNT50, and PsVNA50 titers remained low (Figs 6 and 8 and S9 Fig). This outcome is almost identical to that of Marburg and Ravn virus infection in ferrets, where the development of neutralizing antibody titers was the only sign that productive infection occurred [66]. Previous experiments in hamsters, have demonstrated that 2x105 PFU of gamma-irradiated ANDV and SNV are not sufficient to cause seroconversion, and neither is 1x104 gamma-irradiated PFU PUUV [6, 57]. Thus the seroconversion observed in ferrets, though low, is not likely to be due to a reaction to the large quantity of antigen administered, but to a productive infection.",

When ferrets were immunosuppressed on Day 42 post infection, rapid weight loss and lethargy ensured (Fig 5). Given that these clinical signs were also observed in unchallenged control animals (S10 Fig), this could likely be the result of a secondary infection or drug toxicity. The use of Cyp is well documented in ferrets, primarily given at a high dose as an emetic, and no dosage for long term immunosuppression was found [78]. The dosages used in this study (between 10\u201330 mg/kg) successfully reduced white blood cell levels, in ferrets and demonstrate that Cyp can be used to induce long-term immunosuppression, if antibiotics are given to control for secondary infection (S8 Fig).",

Individuals with HFRS exhibit proteinuria and hematuria, both of which can indicate kidney damage [46, 47]. Additionally, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are both elevated in HFRS patients and provide a second way to measure kidney function [46, 47, 73]. Decreased platelet levels also characterize clinical HFRS in humans, impairing coagulation [46, 47, 73]. In a second experiment designed to monitor kidney parameters, PUUV infected ferrets exhibited the same gradual weight loss that characterized the first experiment. However, no prolonged signs of clinical kidney failure were observed: blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels did not dramatically increase over the five week study period. Only one animal exhibited proteinuria (day 35), and two exhibited hematuria (one on Day 4, and one on Day 21) (Fig 7). Similarly to parameters monitoring renal failure, no thrombocytopenia occurred in PUUV infected ferrets (S9 and S13 Figs). The cause of the weight loss remains undetermined.",

Moreover, although the animals are infected the resultant neutralizing antibody titers are small, resulting in potential sensitivity issues with the model.

Like the ferret, no significant pathological abnormalities were noted, and no signs of renal failure were observed (S16 and S19 Figs). Serum chemistry values do not differ from the normal range with the exception of albumin, total bilirubin, and amylase. While these values fell outside the normal range, they did not change over the course of infection indicating the problem may lie in the reference values used. The Piccolo general chemistry panel used to evaluate the parameters is optimized for human testing, and therefore may be less than optimal for evaluating the marmoset, especially those parameters. Additionally, no infectious virus or viral genome was recovered from any organ at Day 30 post infection [79, 80]. This is not surprising, given the high levels of neutralizing antibodies present as early as 21 days post infection (Fig 8). Unlike the ferret, however, marmosets develop exceptionally high neutralizing antibody titers (10,240\u201320,480 by PRNT50 and 14,866\u2013221,557 by PsVNA50), and display low-level serum viremia between two and four weeks post infection (Fig 8). The serum viremia is significantly lower than in hamsters infected with HTNV, where some animals displayed RT-PCR titers of >7log10, and in hamsters infected with ANDV, where infectious virus titers prior to death are > 6log10 [41].",
