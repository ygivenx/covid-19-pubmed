However, several studies report that GP expression also causes cell rounding and cytotoxicity, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. For instance, expression of Ebola GP but not Marburg GP is reported to cause cell detachment without death [3]. Additionally, Ebola GP from Zaire, Sudan and Ivory Coast subtypes are shown to cause cell rounding and detachment ascribed to down-regulation of MHC class I and cell surface adhesion proteins [4], [5]. Interestingly, Ebola GP from the Reston subtype, believed to be non-pathogenic to humans, had a less severe cell rounding effect [4]. GP is also believed to be a key determinant of viral pathogenesis and virus-like particles (VLPs) containing GP are shown to activate human endothelial cells and macrophages [6], [7]. Importantly, the mucin-like region in GP1 is specifically shown to induce cytotoxicity when GP is expressed at similar levels to that seen during Ebola virus infection. Additionally, the other virus proteins tested were not cytotoxic [8]. Collectively, these reports indicate that Ebola GP imparts cell rounding and cytotoxicity in addition to facilitating viral entry.",

Another study shows that GP is not detected in cells infected with Ebola Zaire virus [10]. This failure to detect GP during infection may arise as GP is released from the infected cells either as soluble glycoprotein (sGP) or a soluble form of GP1 [11]. As full-length GP but not sGP is shown to cause cytotoxicity [12], this suggests that the release of sGP during Ebola virus infection could be a mechanism used by the virus to prevent cytotoxicity and replicate and spread throughout the body. Moreover, this release of sGP may also explain why Ebola Zaire GP expressed at levels similar to early infection is not cytotoxic [9].",

VP40 plays an important role in viral replication, assembly and budding [16]. VP40 interacts with cellular factors such as the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase, Tsg101 that comprises part of the ESCRT-I complex, and Sec24C that is a component of the COPII complex [17], [18], [19]. VP40 also has RNA binding and oligomerization properties [20]. The Ebola NP is the principal component of the ribonucleocapsid, which encloses the RNA [21] and is phosphorylated [22].",

GP remained in close proximity to the nuclear membrane consistent with an ER localization while VP40 localized near the plasma membrane (Figure 3A), which agrees with previous reports [29], [30], [31]. However, separate studies show that Ebola GP localizes in the plasma membrane of either tissues from experimentally infected non-human primates [10] or HeLa cells 48 hours post-transfection [24]. Additionally, GP is reported to localize within VP40 filamentous structures following GP and VP40 co-expression, suggesting GP interacts with VP40 during morphogenesis [13]. While we observed little overlay between GP and VP40 here, GP must associate with VP40 filaments to produce infectious virions perhaps during a later phase of the viral replication cycle. Therefore at this early 24 hour time-point, it is likely the GP amount associated with the VP40 filamentous structures is limited compared to the total cellular amount of GP, making it difficult to visualize by fluorescence microscopy here.",

Aggresomes are perinuclear structures lined with vimentin, which recruit molecular chaperones and proteosomes. They are believed to regulate protein folding and degradation of misfolded proteins [32]. Therefore, the NP association with vimentin here suggests the NP was present in aggresome-like structures. Previous studies using cells infected with Marburg virus report Marburg NP accumulates in structures resembling inclusion bodies in close proximity to the ER [33], [34]. So it is possible that the Ebola NP in these aggresome-like structures could perhaps serve as sites for assembly of filoviral nucleocapsid analogous to African swine fever virus [35] and herpes simplex virus type 2 [36].",

While we did not detect NP in the VP40 filamentous structures here, previous studies suggest that NP interacts directly with VP40, and is present in VP40-containing VLPs when VP40 and NP are co-expressed [14], [15]. Thus, perhaps NP is recruited to VP40-containing VLPs at a later stage during filament formation than the 24 hours experiment here, or another viral protein is required for VP40 and NP interaction.",

Recently, the Classical Swine Fever virus NS2 protein is reported to localize to the ER and cause ER stress and NF\u03baB activation [41]. Similarly, the SARS coronavirus 3a protein causes ER stress and activates the PERK pathway leading to unfolded protein response (UPR) [42]. Therefore, Ebola GP accumulation in the ER may interfere with protein synthesis, folding and transport thereby activating UPR to cause ER stress. Understanding the exact mechanism of GP accumulation in the ER and its correlation to cytotoxicity may be useful in designing inhibitors to block this cytotoxic effect during Ebola virus infection of patients and/or potentially reduce the severe pathogenic effects these patients experience.",
