Laboratory data show that the carrageenan-polymer binds directly to the virus but not to cells trapping the particle and preventing cell attachment. Thus, carrageenan interferes with the virus life cycle at a very early stage due to a physical mechanism of action. Studies in vitro and in vivo have shown the effectiveness of carrageenan against several viruses such as hRV [27], influenza A [26] and RSV. Tests in vitro have shown that carrageenan does not penetrate the mucosa. Therefore, pharmacological, immunological or metabolic activities of carrageenan are not to be expected.",

Hence, analysis of effectiveness was carried out for patients with laboratory confirmed cold virus infection (Figure 1).

This study confirms the results of earlier studies in adults and children. For patients compliant to the protocol and positive for a cold virus infection, a reduction of disease duration of 2.1 days was observed. The results therefore confirm that the local antiviral effectiveness of carrageenan leads to a significant clinical benefit. A pronounced trend was also observed in the ITT-VP population although differences did not reach the level of statistical significance. The main difference between the ITT-VP and PP-VP populations is the use of concomitant medication during the study. Patients were excluded from the PP analysis due to insufficient use of study medication when a reduction of dosage of more than 20% corresponding to 1.5 days of treatment was documented. Thus it can be concluded that tested dosage of 3 times per day is necessary and fewer applications may lead to a reduced clinical benefit.",

Consequently, the current study is limited by the fact that the placebo nasal spray containing a saline nasal solution most likely has caused a clinical benefit as well.

It can be assumed that both, adults and children infected with common cold viruses will benefit from local application of carrageenan in a similar way. In adults, the effect on disease duration might be masked by patients with cold symptoms not caused by viral infections. However, the faster rate of symptom reduction in all iota-carrageenan treated adults suggests that all patients with cold symptoms will have an added benefit when compared with a standard saline nasal spray that served as a placebo in the trial.",

No significant difference in TSS between carrageenan and placebo groups was observed in the first 3 days of the study.

The clinical relevance of this finding is supported by the fact that symptom scores on day 3 of carrageenan treated patients were at the same levels as placebo treated patients on day 5, indicating a reduction in time to symptom alleviation of 2 days.

Iota-carrageenan treated patients in the ITT-VP smoke exposed population (includes smokers and smoking exposed) showed an estimated duration of disease of 10.0 days (95% confidence interval [CI]; 8.1-12.0 days) in the carrageenan group compared to 13.6 days (95% CI; 10.9-16.3 days) in the placebo group (log-rank test, p = 0.031).
