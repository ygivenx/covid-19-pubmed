The synthesis of the negative-strand [(\u2212)-strand] complement from the (+)-strand genome is the first step of genome replication and is assumed to be initiated from the 3\u2032 end of the (+)-strand RNA genome. The 3\u2032 end of the synthesized (\u2212)-strand RNA genome is then employed as the site for the initiation of the (+)-strand RNA genome. Therefore, the RNA elements on the 3\u2032 end of (+)- and (\u2212)-strand RNA genome may play critical roles in targeting the viral replication complex to initiate the synthesis of their counterparts.",

            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCoV), a (+)-strand RNA virus in the subfamily Coronavirinae, the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales, belongs to the genus betacoronaviruses, which includes the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) [1], [2]. Many cis-acting RNA elements in the coronavirus genome required for replication [interpreted as (+)-strand RNA synthesis] have been identified in the past two decades with a full-length infectious cDNA or coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA, a surrogate for the coronavirus genome [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. For cis-acting RNA elements in the 3\u2032 UTR of coronavirus, it has been demonstrated that the minimal requirement for replication maps 436 nucleotides (nts) from the 3\u2032 end of MHV DI RNA according to deletion analyses [19], [20]. Within this region, two higher-order structures on the upstream end of the 3\u2032 UTR have been identified as cis-acting RNA elements that are essential for coronavirus replication, including a 61-nt bulged stem-loop in MHV [12], [13] and a hairpin-type pseudoknot in BCoV DI RNA [15]. Further downstream of the 3\u2032 UTR is a hypervariable region (HVR) which forms a complex secondary structure. Although this secondary structure was shown to be important for the efficient replication of MHV DI RNA [14], a subsequent study using an intact MHV genome demonstrated that the secondary structure is nonessential for RNA synthesis but plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis [21]. Downstream of these higher-order structures are 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts and poly(A) tail. Although coronaviral poly(A) tail has been demonstrated to be a critical element for coronavirus replication [22], the role of the entire 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts in the (+)-strand RNA synthesis remains to be determined.",

For example, there are only an estimated \u223c5 molecules of BCoV DI RNA (\u2212) strand per cell in BCoV DI RNA-transfected BCoV-infected human rectal tumor (HRT)-18 cells at 24 hour postinfection (hpi) of virus passage 1 (VP1) [23], [24]. In order to overcome the detection deficiency and the false positive results of the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA detection caused by artifact of (\u2212)-strand DI RNA transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase using plasmid DNA as a template [25], a head-to-tail ligation method and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been developed to detect (\u2212)-strand BCoV DI RNA [26]. This method, therefore, may be employed to determine the requirements of cis-acting elements for the synthesis of BCoV (\u2212)-strand DI RNA.",

After the discovery of SARS-CoV, other novel subgroups of the betacoronaviruses have been proposed and the original group 2 coronaviruses, which included BCoV and MHV, became designated as 2a coronaviruses [27], [28]. Many cis-acting elements in the 3\u2032 UTR of BCoV and MHV-A59 have been characterized [12], [13], [15], [22], [29]. To examine whether the 3\u2032-most 55 nts have conserved features within the individual subgroups of betacoronaviruses, the 3\u2032-terminal 55-nt sequence was aligned according to the published sequences (see GenBank Accession Nos. in Fig. 1) and the sequence identity within the subgroup 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d coronaviruses was 71%, 100%, 88% and 82%, respectively (Fig. 1). It is apparent that the aligned 3\u2032-terminal 55-nt sequence was highly conserved (identified by shading) across the coronaviruses within the individual subgroups of betacoronaviruses, suggesting that this region may harbor cis-acting elements critical for coronavirus replication.",

            "text": "The coronavirus DI RNA has been employed as a surrogate for coronavirus genome to study the cis-acting elements required for coronavirus replication [3], [5], [6], [11], [15], [20], [22], [29], [30]. The identification of cis-acting RNA elements that are essential for the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis in coronaviruses, however, has been restricted by the low numbers of (\u2212)-strand DI RNA produced from the DI RNA-transfected helper virus-infected cells [23], [24]. Although RT-PCR may be used to detect the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA molecules, a false positive result may occur due to the synthesis of the copy-back (\u2212)-strand DI RNA transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro using plasmid DNA as a template [25]. Thus, to overcome the detection problems caused by the low numbers of (\u2212)-strand DI RNA and to avoid the detection of the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA resulting from the copy-back transcripts, we, based on the previous study [26], (1) created a hybrid BCoV DI RNA construct marked with the MHV 3\u2032 UTR and 25 nts of poly(A) tail (Fig. 2A) to distinguish it from BCoV helper virus genome during RT-PCR and (2) conducted head-to-tail ligation of RNA and RT-PCR to differentiate the coronaviral polymerase-generated (\u2212)-strand DI RNA from T7 RNA polymerase-generated artifact (\u2212)-strand DI RNA (Fig. 2B), as the primers used in the RT-PCR cannot yield a product from the copy-back (\u2212)-strand transcripts after ligation [26]. Note that the sequence in the 3\u2032-termianl 55 nts of the 3\u2032UTR between BCoV and MHV is highly conserved (Fig. 1) and it has been shown that the replication efficiency of BCoV DI RNA with the MHV 3\u2032 UTR is almost the same with that of BCoV DI RNA with BCoV 3\u2032UTR [26]. Accordingly, to test whether the method can be applied to examine the requirement of the 3\u2032-most 55 nts for (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis in the context of BCoV DI RNA, BM25A construct in which the 3\u2032-most 55 nts were intact and \u039455 mutant in which the 3\u2032-most 55 nts were deleted were created (Fig. 3A). After transfection of BM25A and \u039455 transcripts into BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells, RNA was extracted at different time points as indicated in Fig. 3B, head-to-tail ligated, and subjected to RT-PCR. An RT-PCR product with a length of \u223c150 base pair (bp) was obtained from BM25A-transfected BCoV-infected cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 2\u20138) but not from \u039455-transfected BCoV-infected cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 10\u201316), mock-infected cells (Fig. 3B, lane 18), BCoV-infected cells (Fig. 3B, lane 19), BM25A-transfected mock-infected cells (Fig. 3B, lane 20), or a mixture of BCoV-infected cellular RNA extracted at 10 hpi and 200 ng of BM25A transcript (Fig. 3B, lane 21). These results, along with sequencing analysis (Fig. 3C), confirmed that the \u223c150-bp RT-PCR product obtained from BM25A-transfected BCoV-infected cells was specific from head-to-tail-ligated coronavirus polymerase-generated (\u2013)-strand DI RNA. Because DI RNA may undergo recombination with helper virus genome under select pressure [31], [32], [33], [34], the detected (\u2013)-strand DI RNA in Fig. 3B may be derived from the recombinant genome rather than input (+)-strand DI RNA. To seek evidence of a DI RNA reporter-containing recombinant genome, the RNA samples extracted from the BM25A- and \u039455-transfected BCoV-infected cells at 8 hour posttransfection (hpt) were tested for a 1,639-nt helper virus genome-integrated reporter-containing sequence between the membrane (M) protein gene and the DI RNA 3\u2032 UTR using RT-PCR [26]. No RT-PCR product (Fig. 3D, lanes 2\u20133) was observed, suggesting that the detected \u223c150 bp RT-PCR products do not result from a recombinant helper virus genome. To compare the efficiency of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA synthesis between BM25A and \u039455, head-to-tail ligated RNA extracted at 8 hpt was subjected to qRT-PCR with the same primer set used for the RT-PCR analysis. The results (Fig. 3E, left panel) suggest that the efficiency of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA synthesis from \u039455 was significantly impaired in comparison with that from BM25A. Thus, we conclude that (1) using the head-to-tail RNA ligation and qRT-PCR allows us to detect and quantitate (\u2013)-strand BCoV DI RNA and (2) the 3\u2032-most 55 nts in BCoV DI RNA are required for (\u2013)-strand DI RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "We have demonstrated in the present study that the 3\u2032-most 55 nts are required for the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand BCoV DI RNA using the head-to-tail RNA ligation and qRT-PCR (Fig. 3). The map positions of the cis-acting RNA elements required for (\u2013)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis within this 55-nt region, however, remain to be determined. To define the specific cis-acting RNA elements within the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts which function in the synthesis of BCoV DI RNA (\u2013) or (+) strands, a series of DI RNA constructs with deletions either from the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 end of the 55-nt region were generated by mutagenesis (Fig. 4A) and tested by the methods depicted in Fig. S1 and described as follows. The T7 RNA polymerase-generated transcript of each construct was transfected into BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells and virus within the transfected cells was referred to as virus passage 0 (VP0). The total cellular RNA was collected at 8 hpt of RNA transcript to detect the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA by qRT-PCR. Since the transfected transcript was still in the BCoV-infected cells at 8 hpt as shown in Fig. 3E (right panel), it is difficult to differentiate between the coronaviral polymerase-generated (+)-strand DI RNA and T7 RNA polymerase-generated (+)-strand DI RNA by Northern blot assay at this time point. Therefore, to determine whether the detected (+)-strand DI RNA is specifically synthesized by the BCoV polymerase, the supernatant virus collected at 48 hpt, which is now called virus passage 1 or VP1, was used to infect fresh HRT-18 cells (Fig. S1). The total cellular RNA collected at 48 hpi of VP1 was used to detect the synthesis of (+)-strand DI RNA by the Northern blot assay. If the T7 RNA polymerase-generated DI RNA, which is transfected at VP0, is not able to replicate, the transfected (+)-strand DI RNA cannot be detected at 48 hpi of VP1 [5], [6], [15], [35], [36]. The signals detected by Northern blot assay were quantitated and presented in percentages as a result of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis [relative to the wt BM25A (100%)]. These results are summarized in Figs 4B and 4C. As shown in Fig. 4B, DI RNA constructs with a 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-nt deletion (constructs \u03941, \u03942, \u03943 and \u03944, respectively) at the 3\u2032 terminus of the 55-nt region still maintained the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA (Fig. 4B) although the synthesis efficiency was impaired (\u223c55% to \u223c80% of the wt BM25A). Among these constructs, BCoV DI RNA with a 1- and 2-nt deletion at the 3\u2032 terminus still supported the (+)-strand synthesis (54.9% and 84.7% of the wt BM25A, respectively) (Fig. 4C, lanes 8\u20139), whereas DI RNA constructs with a 3- and 4-nt deletion totally abolished the (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis (Fig. 4C, lanes 6\u20137). Further deletion of 5-, 15-, 30-, and 55- nts (constructs \u03945, \u039415, \u039430 and \u039455, respectively) (Fig. 4A) from the 3\u2032 terminus of the 55-nt region led to a significant decrease in the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand (less than 10% of wt BM25A) (Fig. 4B) and (+)-strand DI RNA (Fig. 4C, lanes 2\u20135).",

            "text": "To further dissect the specific cis-acting RNA motif required for (\u2013)- and (+)-strand RNA synthesis within this 55-nt region, DI RNA constructs with various deletions from the 5\u2032 terminus of this region were created and tested (Fig. 4A). The efficiency of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA synthesis from DI RNA with a deletion from nts \u201355 to \u201345 (construct \u039455-45) was not affected and was even better than that from wt BM25A (Fig. 4B) although the efficiency of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis was impaired (44.5% of wt BM25A, Fig. 4C, lane 10). The extension of the deletion from nts -55 to -40 in DI RNA (construct \u039455-40) still did not affect the efficiency of both (\u2013)-and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis (Fig. 4 B and Fig. 4C, lane 11, respectively). Surprisingly, DI RNA with a deletion from nts \u201355 to \u201335 (construct \u039455-35) almost blocked the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA (less than 20% of wt BM25A, Fig. 4B) but still maintained the (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis (78.9% of wt BM25A, Fig. 4C, lane 12). On the other hand, both (\u2013)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis were significantly inhibited from DI RNA with a deletion from nts \u201355 to \u201330 (construct \u039455-30) (Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C, lane 13, respectively). The efficiency of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA synthesis was also significantly blocked in the construct \u039430-15 with a deletion from nts \u201330 to \u201315 (\u223c40% of wt BM25A, Fig. 4B) and no (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis was detected from this deletion mutant (Fig. 4C, lane 14), suggesting the nts from \u201330 to \u201315 are critical for both (\u2013)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. Of these deletion mutants, all of the mutated sequences in the synthesized (\u2013)-strand DI RNA were still maintained at 8 hpt; however, the available mutant sequences in the (\u2013)- and (+)- strand DI RNA at 48 hpi of VP1 showed that all contained the sequence with majority from wt DI RNA except for the mutant \u03942 in which the sequence of mutant \u03942 was mixed with that of wt BM25A (Fig. 4C). Based on these results, the tentative conclusions at this time were as follows: (1) the nts from \u20131 to \u20134 and from \u201340 to \u201355 are not important for the (\u2013)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis and (2) the nts from \u20131 to \u20132 and from \u201335 to \u201355 are not absolutely required for the (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis. Therefore, the critical cis-acting elements essential for (\u2013)- or (+)-strand synthesis may reside in the region between the nts \u20132 and \u201340. To further determine the requirement of cis-acting elements for the (\u2013)- and (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis in this region, deletion mutants \u03945\u201314, \u039415\u201324, \u039425\u201334, and \u039435\u201339 were constructed (Fig. 5A) and tested. As shown in Fig 5B, the efficiency of the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis from these deletion constructs was inhibited (\u223c29% to \u223c42% of wt BM25A). The (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis was still maintained from construct \u039435\u201339 (60.4% of wt BM 25A) (Fig. 5C, lane 2) but was significantly blocked from constructs \u03945\u201314, \u039415\u201324 and \u039425\u201334 (Fig. 5C, lanes 3\u20135). Sequencing analysis showed that all of the mutated sequences in these synthesized (\u2212)-strand DI RNA were still maintained at 8 hpt; however, all the mutants reversed back to wt DI RNA at 48 hpi of VP1. The sequencing results acquired from DI RNA constructs \u03941, \u039455\u201345, \u039455\u201340, \u039455\u201335, and \u039435\u201339 at 48 hpi of VP1 (Figs. 4C and 5C) indicate that the (+)-strand DI RNA detected by Northern blot assay may mostly originated from wt DI RNA (BM25A) that likely arose by reversion and consequently the importance of the mutated sequences remains to be determined. To confirm that these DI RNA mutants are able to replicate, the supernatant collected at 48 hpt was used to infect fresh HRT-18 cells. The total cellular RNA was harvested at 24 hpi of VP1 and then subjected to Northern blot assay and sequencing analyses. As shown in Fig. S2, the relative replication efficiency of these mutants at 24 hpi of VP1 was similar to that at 48 hpi of VP1. Sequencing analysis revealed that the mutated sequences were still maintained in the mutants \u03942, \u039455\u201340 and \u039435\u201339. Although the sequencing results presented a mixed population in the mutants \u03941, \u039455\u201345 and \u039455\u201335, the majority of the sequences were from the mutants rather than from the wt DI RNA (BM25A). These results suggest that these DI RNA mutants still maintain the ability to replicate although the replication efficiency among these mutants varied. Taken together, based on the deletion mutagenesis experiments and sequence analysis, we conclude that the nts from \u22125 to \u221239 within the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts are the cis-acting elements responsible for the (\u2212)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis and that the nts from \u22123 to \u221234 within the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts are the cis-acting elements required for the (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis.",

Since the last nucleotide of the 3\u2032 UTR in all coronavirus genomes sequenced to date is cytosine, it was speculated that this conserved nucleotide species may play an important role in coronavirus replication. To test this hypothesis, the cytosine residing at the last nucleotide of the 3\u2032 UTR in BCoV DI RNA was substituted with adenine, uracil and guanine to make the constructs BM-3\u2032A, BM-3\u2032U, and BM-3\u2032G, respectively (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, even though construct BM-3\u2032A was still able to synthesize its (\u2212)-strand counterpart (\u223c60% of wt BM25A), its ability to synthesize (+)-strand was significantly abolished (7.5% of wt BM25A) (Fig. 6C, lane 2). In contrast, the efficiency of the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis from construct BM-3\u2032U was significantly inhibited (\u223c30% of wt BM25A) (Fig. 6B), but the efficiency of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis from construct BM-3\u2032U was similar to that from wt BM25A (88.1% of wt BM25A, Fig. 6C, lane 3). The efficiency of both (\u2212)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis (Fig. 6B and Fig. 6C, lane 4, respectively) from construct BM-3\u2032G, on the other hand, was significantly blocked (\u223c10% and \u223c21.8% of wt BM25A, respectively). Sequencing analysis from VP1 revealed that the mutants BM-3\u2032A and BM-3\u2032G reverted back to the wt sequence, but the mutant BM-3\u2032U still maintained the mutated sequence. The results together suggest that (1) the substitution of the 3\u2032-most nucleotide cytosine with other nucleotide species is sensitive for (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis and (2) the substitution of the 3\u2032-most cytosine residue by uracil, but not adenine or guanine, is more tolerant for (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. The nucleotide species at the 3\u2032-most position (\u22121), therefore, is important, but not critical, for both (\u2212)- and (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis.",

The identification of the cis-acting elements specific for (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis in coronavirus, however, has been hampered due to insufficiencies in the techniques used to detect and quantitate RNA (\u2212) strand species. In this study, we employed the method of head-to-tail ligation and qRT-PCR to examine the cis-acting elements required for (\u2212)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis [26], [37]. This method has the advantages of detecting and quantitating low copy number of (\u2212)-strand BCoV DI RNA as well as distinguishing between T7 RNA polymerase-generated (\u2212)-strand DI RNA transcripts and coronaviral polymerase-generated (\u2212)-strand DI RNA, and thereby allows us to systematically examine the cis-acting RNA elements required for (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis and to gain insight into the mechanism of coronavirus replication.",

            "text": "Replication of (+)-strand RNA viruses can be generally divided into two steps. First, the viral polymerase employs a (+)-strand genome as a template to generate the (\u2212)-strand complement. Second, the synthesized (\u2212)-strand genome then serves as a template for the synthesis of the (+)-strand counterpart. The majority of previous studies on cis-acting elements in coronaviruses emphasize their roles in replication [interpreted as (+)-strand synthesis]; however, it is still unclear that the identified cis-acting elements function in (\u2212)- or (+)-strand synthesis. We in this study, therefore, simultaneously analyzed the effects of cis-acting elements on the synthesis of both (\u2212)- and (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA during infection in order to specifically define the role of a cis-acting element. According to the results concerning the (\u2212)- and (+)- strand DI RNA synthesis from mutants \u03945, \u039415, \u039430 and \u039455, we conclude that the deleted sequences may function at least in the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis because the deleted sequences significantly blocked the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis from their (+)-strand DI RNA templates (Fig. 4B). Regarding the role of these deleted sequences in the (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis, however, it is not feasible to speculate from these mutants at this time because the undetectable (+)-strand DI RNA in VP1from these mutants may be due to the very low amounts of the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA templates or due to the deleted sequences which block the synthesis of (+)-strand DI RNA. For the mutants \u03941, \u03942, \u03943, and \u03944, the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis was overall slightly affected with the deleted sequences (Fig. 4B). However, the defect in (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis from the mutants \u03943 and \u03944 (Fig. 4C, lanes 6\u20137) indicates that nts from \u22123 to \u22124 are critical cis-acting elements in the synthesis of (+)-strand rather than (\u2212)-strand DI RNA. In comparison with wt BM25A, the efficiency of both (\u2212)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis from the mutants \u039455\u201345 and \u039455\u201340 was not significantly inhibited, suggesting nts from \u221255 to \u221240 are not absolutely required for both (\u2212)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. Interestingly, the efficiency of (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis from deletion mutant \u039455-45 was even higher than that from wt BM25A as shown in Fig. 4B. Regarding the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts in the MHV 3\u2032 UTR, the sequence between \u22121 and \u221244 in the deletion mutant \u039455-45 is nearly identical to that in the BCoV 3\u2032 UTR after alignment. It could be possible that BCoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase utilizes the almost authentic BCoV 3\u2032 UTR in mutant \u039455-45 more efficiently than the MHV 3\u2032 UTR in the BM25A, leading to a better efficiency in the synthesis of (\u2212)-strand DI RNA. It is also intriguing that the replication efficiency from the 16-nts deletion mutant \u039455-40 was enhanced, but the replication efficiency from the 11-nts deletion mutant \u039455-45 was repressed in comparison with that from wt BM25A (Fig. 4C). However, the involvement of 3\u2032 UTR elements such as enhancers and repressors in the regulatory functions of replication has been suggested in RNA viruses [38], [39], [40]. Therefore, considering the replication efficiency of \u039455\u201345, \u039455\u201340 and \u039455\u201335 (44%, 102% and 78%, respectively), we speculate that nts \u221245 to \u221255 may serve as an enhancer because the deletion of these nts in mutant \u039455\u201345 leads to the modest inhibition of replication. In contrast, nts \u221240 to \u221244 may act as a repressor and the synergistic effect of both enhancer and repressor, which are missing in the mutant \u039455\u201340, could be the reason why the construct had the similar or even higher replication efficiency in comparison with wt BM25A. Similarly, nts \u221235 to \u221239 may play a role of enhancer as evidenced by the comparison of replication efficiency between \u039455\u201340 and \u039455\u201335 (102% vs 78%) (Fig. 4C) and between wt BM25A and \u039435\u201339 (100% vs 60%) (Fig. 5C). In mutants \u039455\u201335 and \u039435\u201339, the efficiency of (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis was significantly decreased, but the (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis was still maintained. The results suggest that the efficiency of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis may not be affected by the existing numbers of (\u2212)-strand DI RNAs as long as the cis-acting element [on (\u2212)-strand DI RNA] required for (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis is intact. These results are also in agreement with the previously proposed model which indicated that the (\u2212)-strand viral RNA is repeatedly used as a template for (+)-strand viral RNA synthesis [29]. Based on the criteria, the deleted sequences in mutants \u03945\u201314, \u039415\u201324 and \u039425\u201334 are required for both (\u2212)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis since the (\u2212)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis from these mutants was significantly inhibited (Figs. 5B and 5C). Therefore, simultaneously analyzing the efficiency of (\u2212)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis enables us to specifically define the cis-acting elements that function in (\u2212)- or (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Because the last nucleotide of the 3\u2032 UTR in all coronavirus genomes sequenced to date is cytosine and coronavirus nonstructural protein 8 has been proposed to preferentially initiate the synthesis of primer at the cytosine within the internal 5\u2032-(G/U)CC-3\u2032 trinucleotides [41], we in the present study speculated that the cytosine residue may play a critical role in (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis. Since the substitution of the cytosine with adenine, guanine or uracil inhibited the (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis at different levels (Fig. 6B), the 3\u2032-most nucleotide species apparently is critical for (\u2212)-strand DI RNA synthesis. Nevertheless, whether the cytosine is involved in the primer-dependent (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis remains to be elucidated. On the other hand, the results that the substitution of the cytosine with adenine and guanine, but not uracil, almost blocked (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis suggest that a purine (adenine and guanine), but not a pyrimidine (cytosine and uracil), on the 5\u2032-most nucleotide of (\u2212)-strand 3\u2032 UTR is preferred for subsequent (+)-strand synthesis. Thus, these results suggest that the 3\u2032-most nucleotide species on the DI RNA (+) strand is an important element for both (\u2212)-and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis.",

However, evidence from this study and previous findings [12], [13], [14], [15] has also shown that alterations of the sequence at the 3\u2032 terminal region of (+)-strand RNA [5\u2032 terminal region on (\u2212)-strand RNA] also impairs the synthesis of (+)-strand RNA. The reasons why the sequence alterations at the 3\u2032-terminal region on (+)-strand RNA, for example, mutants \u03943, \u03944, BM-3\u2032A, and BM-3\u2032G, affected the synthesis of (+)-strand RNA remains unknown. However, since (1) the interactions between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the genome facilitated by RNA or/and protein to form the replication complex and thereby to initiate replication have been well documented in numerous of RNA viruses [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54] and (2) the results from this study that the mutations in the 3\u2032-terminal region of (+)-strand DI RNA were able to alter the efficiency of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis, we postulate that the sequence mutations in the 3\u2032-terminal region of (+)-strand DI RNA [5\u2032 terminal region of (\u2212)-strand DI RNA] may hinder the binding of proteins to this region and then block the interactions between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the (\u2212)-strand genome to constitute the replication complex that is required for (+)-strand synthesis. This notion is supported by the previous studies in which the nts from \u221226 to \u221236 in the MHV 3\u2032 UTR have been demonstrated to be required for host protein binding and viral RNA replication [18], [55]. Further study is required to elucidate whether the cis-acting elements identified in this study and others are involved in the constitution of replication complex in the (\u2212)-strand RNA genome, which is required for the subsequent (+)-strand RNA synthesis.",
