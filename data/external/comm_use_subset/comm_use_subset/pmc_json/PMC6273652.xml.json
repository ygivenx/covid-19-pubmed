Inflammation is a primordial response that protects against infection and restores damaged tissue to its normal physiological functioning [2]. A recent study reported that it is becoming more important to maintain inflammatory homeostasis and to regulate the immune system [3]. Inflammation is an innate immune response by various immune cells, such as macrophages, to protect against harmful stimuli, such as viruses and bacteria [4]. During the inflammatory reaction, macrophages produce inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), cytokines, and growth factors. Calcium is released by macrophages during inflammatory processes. Therefore, modulating macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses is important for creating a new therapeutic approach against inflammatory diseases [5].",

The biological activities of quercetin have been extensively demonstrated in various experimental models. For example, Liao and Lin have reported that quercetin significantly increased IL-10 secretions by peritoneal macrophages of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic mice [10]; Gardi et al. have reported that quercetin lowered levels of IL-1\u03b2, C-reactive protein, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in a rat model of adjuvant arthritis [11]; Guazelli et al. have reported that the oral administration of quercetin -loaded microcapsules decreases neutrophil recruitment, attenuates histological alterations, and reduces macroscopical damage, edema, and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-33 production in a mouse model of acetic acid -induced colitis [12]. Recently, Chiow et al. have reported that quercetin could inhibit both mouse hepatitis virus and dengue virus (type 2) [13]. Wo et al. have reported that quercetin may exert its antiviral activity against different influenza virus strains (including H1N1 and H3N2) via interaction with viral hemagglutinin protein and then inhibit virus entry into the cell [14]. However, the effects of quercetin on poly(I:C)-induced macrophages have not been fully reported.",

Appropriate levels of NO assist in mounting an effective defense against invading microbes, whereas the inability to generate NO results in serious, even fatal, susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, dysregulation or overproduction of NO has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many disorders, including atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory autoimmune diseases, and cancers; therefore, the potential exists for NO to behave like a \u201cdouble-edged\u201d biological sword depending on it level. Thus, it is crucial to understand regulation of NO [23].",

            "text": "Some studies show that the regulation of inflammation is important for maintaining homeostasis [3]. Inflammation plays a critical defensive role in the human body, however, uncontrolled or aberrant inflammatory responses contribute to various acute and chronic inflammatory diseases [24]. Inflammation helps restore homeostasis after an insult but can be more damaging than the insult itself if uncontrolled, excessive, or prolonged [25]. For example, dysregulation of the inflammatory/immune responses is responsible for multiple organ failure in patients with sepsis, for which over expression of proinflammatory cytokines is a major mechanism [26]. It is well known that viral and bacterial infections contribute to the pathogenesis of severe sepsis, which is characterized by an overwhelming production of NO and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 [27]. Despite antibiotics, sepsis remains a clinical challenge, with high mortality rates and increasing prevalence [28]. The expression level of RANTES increases in lung tissue infected with influenza virus [29]. The robust, uncontrolled cytokine production, otherwise known as hypercytokinemia or a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, is thought to initiate the severe systemic inflammatory response in various infections, such as those caused by influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, variola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and avian H5N1 influenza virus [30]. Thus, it is important to focus on therapeutics to modulate virus-induced hyperinflammation.",
