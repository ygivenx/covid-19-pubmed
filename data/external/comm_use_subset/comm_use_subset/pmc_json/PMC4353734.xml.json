Transmission of influenza virus is known to occur directly and indirectly (7,8). Direct transmission occurs through inhalation of virus-containing droplets, which are exhaled by an infected individual. Although droplet-borne infection is considered to be the major route for influenza virus transmission (9), the role of transmission via the contact route has also been emphasized (7,8). This indirect transmission occurs primarily through hand contact with a virus-contaminated surface around the infected individual. Viruses exhaled from the infected person can be easily deposited on various surfaces that subsequently come into contact with the uninfected individuals.",

Since there are natural variations in the number and size of such droplets generated from the same individual during these activities, it is difficult to determine the size and number of droplets. The size of the droplets exhaled by infected individuals vary widely (\u03bcm-mm). Although the droplets with a smaller size are likely to be dominant (9), in the present study, a 10-\u03bcl volume (~2.7 mm in diameter if spherical) was arbitrarily selected to quantitatively contaminate the clothing with the virus. Namely, a 10-\u03bcl sample of virus preparation was deposited on the test cloths and the contaminated cloths were maintained in air for 20 min to mimic the actual situation that may occur between the time of clothing contamination and the time of exposure to the hands of the second individual. After leaving for 20 min in air, the cloths were transferred to glass test tubes, the contaminated virus was extracted with PBS containing 0.1% BSA by vigorous mixing with a Vortex mixer, and the amount of infectious virus recovered in the extract was measured. Notably, the measured values reflect only the infectious virus recovered in the extracts, not those irreversibly absorbed on the cloths.

Fig. 1A shows the time course, in which a trend is clear. For the white sweater, there was essentially no loss of virus over the 20-min incubation period (diamond), which was similar to the control (open circles), in which the virus preparation was inoculated on the inner surface of the glass test tube. For the cardigan (triangle) and T-shirt (square), a gradual loss was observed, while virus infectivity was rapidly lost for the jersey (closed circle). These results correlate with the relative remaining virus infectivity at 20 min, with the exception of the T-shirt. Variation for the T-shirt may have been caused by differences among the clothing samples with regard to the time necessary for the evaporation of water from the deposit, since we observed that different samples from the same items of clothing often showed variability in virus recovery, and this variability was often very noticeable among independent experiments. Although little experimental fluctuations were observed for the PBS control and the white sweater, both the cardigan and T-shirt, which were intermediate in virus recovery (Fig. 1A), exhibited strong variation among the experiments, suggesting that recovery from these samples may be easily influenced by variations in the experiments. The presence or absence of these variations in virus recovery may be associated with the observation that the mode of absorption of virus-containing liquid into test cloths is quite variable among samples from different types of material, as well as numerous samples from the same item of clothing. For example, the absorbance of virus-containing solution was stable in all of the samples from the white sweater, whereas in some samples from the cardigan and T-shirt the solution was immediately absorbed, yet in others it remained unabsorbed for a longer period of time. These observations support the importance of water in the deposit for the maintenance of the infectivity and transmissibility of influenza virus on contaminated clothes.",

The pH of the sample cloths was measured by soaking in 20 volumes (volume/weight) of distilled water at room temperature for 3 or 48 h, with occasional mixing using a Vortex mixer. However, the solution in all the cloth samples showed a neutral pH regardless of the incubation time. Since the virus preparation was developed using PBS containing 0.1% BSA, which exerts a strong buffering function, the pH of the deposited solution on these cloths at the site of inoculation should be even closer to a neutral pH. These results indicated that the pH of the cloths played no role in the different recoveries observed for the virus infectivity from the test cloths.",

            "text": "An aqueous environment is generally preferable for virus survival; as described above, water loss from the contaminated clothing may be associated with the observed virus recovery and inactivation. In a safety cabinet, rapid airflow maintains the sterility and bioprotective efficacy of the cabinet. This airflow caused the evaporation of water from the sample cloths over time. Time courses of evaporation from the jersey, cardigan, T-shirt and white sweater were evaluated (Fig. 1B) by examining the relative amount of residual water as a function of time. These four cloths represent four water loss patterns of the nine cloths examined. The jersey rapidly lost water, reaching >95% loss within 10 min after leaving the contaminated cloths in the safety cabinet (closed circle). Similar results were obtained for the one-piece; the amount of residual water at 10 min after deposit was 3.3% of the input, as compared with 2.8% of the input for the jersey. These two cloths exhibited a virus recovery that was below the detection level at 20 min after the deposit of virus suspension on the cloths (Table I). By contrast, the white sweater lost little water over time, with ~70% of the water remaining after 20 min (diamond); this sample conferred the highest virus recovery among the test cloths (Table I and Fig. 1A). The other two sample cloths exhibited intermediate water evaporation between the jersey and white sweater, with the water content of the cardigan (triangle) and T-shirt (square) exhibiting water loss of ~20% for every 5-min interval. Essentially similar results were obtained for the parker and black sweater. These cloths showed intermediate virus recoveries in Table I. Therefore, the results demonstrated a correlation between water loss and virus recovery; namely, the cloth samples that lost water faster yielded the lower virus recovery (fewer transmissible infectious viruses). In addition, the rate of water loss appeared to be associated with the water-repelling nature (hydrophobic) of the cloths; the cloths that were more hydrophilic lost water faster (data not shown).",

The present study examined the recovery of influenza virus from experimentally virus-contaminated clothing, in order to understand the role of contaminated clothes in the transmission of influenza A virus during an epidemic period. Although the amount of infectious virus recovered from the contaminated clothes was markedly different between the clothing samples, the difference in recovery correlated with the residual amount of water in the deposited virus preparation on the test cloths. Considering that water from natural droplets would quickly evaporate once the droplet had fallen onto the clothes, indirect transmission of influenza through virus-contaminated clothing may occur, if only under limited circumstances. To understand the role of indirect transmission, further work is required; such as the study of the survival of viruses on contaminated hands and environmental surfaces, such as doorknobs and household furniture.",
