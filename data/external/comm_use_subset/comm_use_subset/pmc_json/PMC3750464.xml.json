It is an immune mechanism that removes intracellular pathogens by the degradation of dysfunctional intracellular organelles. Mammalian autophagy involves initiation, nucleation, elongation, closure, maturation, and degradation [2]. Impaired autophagy has been linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), tuberculosis neurodegeneration, and aging. Polymorphisms in two autophagy-related genes\u2014ATG16L1 and interferon-regulated GTPase (IRGM)\u2014are strongly correlated with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) [3,4]. Autophagy occurs in the intestinal epithelium of neonatal piglets [5], in the intestinal epithelium of NEC patients and in the ileum of NEC rats [6]. Multiple autophagy-related proteins control autophagosome formation. Activated mTOR, VPS34, and Beclin-1 (a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg6) are required to induce autophagy. Although it is unclear whether autophagy is a protective response or a deleterious process, it is clear that uncontrolled autophagy has adverse effects in certain pathological conditions, ultimately causing cell death.",

Rotavirus hijacks autophagy and uses its membranes to transport viral proteins for the assembly of infectious particles at the sites of virus replication; inhibition of the autophagy signaling pathway blocks virus production [7]. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is a probiotic strain that has reduced rotavirus diarrhea in many clinical trials [8-14]. The benefits of LGG therapy include reduced duration and incidence of rotavirus diarrhea, diminished rotavirus shedding, and increased production of rotavirus-specific antibodies. However, the molecular mechanisms of LGG protection from rotavirus diarrhea are not well understood.",

We measured the effects of continuous LGG feeding in the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of virulent human rotavirus (HRV) gastroenteritis. Pigs were assigned to the following treatment groups: LGG plus HRV, HRV only, LGG only (LGG) or mock control. We investigated intestinal autophagy markers and pathologic changes in these groups. Here, we report that rotavirus infection alone, but not LGG alone, induced autophagy in the intestines of Gn pigs. LGG reduced the expression of autophagy markers to baseline levels and partially prevented tissue damage. Our study provides new insights into virus-induced autophagy and the role of LGG in suppressing autophagy and intestinal injury during viral gastroenteritis.",

By H&E staining, we observed vigorous immune infiltration (yellow arrow) and discontinued muscularis mucosae (green arrow) in pig ileum infected with HRV (Figure 5A), but the LGG-treated infected ileum had less inflammation. LGG helped to maintain intestinal epithelial integrity. Claudin-2 is a \u2018leaky\u2019 claudin that forms a water channel, which mediates paracellular water transport in leaky epithelia [22-26]. Western blotting showed that virus infection increased the expression of claudin-2, whereas LGG treatment lowered the claudin-2 level after infection (Figure 5B). This result may explain our observations that LGG-treated piglets were less likely to develop HRV diarrhea and had a shorter mean duration of diarrhea compared with the non-treated group (data not shown). Our previous study and unpublished data showed that non-treated infected pigs had worse clinical and histopathological outcomes than the LGG+HRV group. Virus shedding was also lower in the LGG-treated pigs compared with the non-treated HRV group (data not shown).",

Impaired autophagy is associated with the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. Our data show that while rotavirus activated autophagy in the intestine at PID 2, LGG treatment down-regulated autophagy in response to viral infection, providing a balance between apoptosis and autophagy in the infected intestine (Figure 5C). In HRV-infected cells, LGG promotes apoptosis, which restricts virus spread to neighboring epithelia. LGG reduces rotavirus replication by suppressing the expression of autophagy proteins, which in turn impairs the assembly of infectious rotavirus particles [7]. Our study suggests a new molecular mechanism by which LGG suppresses uncontrolled autophagy and intestinal injury during viral gastroenteritis. Autophagy and apoptosis are connected both positively and negatively, and extensive crosstalk exists between them. Because our data showed that LGG-treated intestine had more apoptotic cells, LGG-induced apoptosis could help the host clear infected cells.",

We had limited number of piglets in the experimental groups. We could not use a genetically engineered pig model to further investigate the host autophagy responses or the genes that mediate the protective role of LGG. In an in vitro experiment, we investigated autophagy after virus infection and LGG treatment in a pig intestinal epithelial cell line [29], but we did not observe responses similar to those in vivo.
