            "text": "Health Geographics is a relatively recent field of research. Indeed, although the link between man\u2019s health and his environment has been underlined in medical sciences since Hippocrates, it took a long time for geography to consider that studying health facts was interesting and justified. A proper current of health geographics only emerged in the years 1970\u20131980. Research is flourishing and concerns themes as varied as the spread of vectorial diseases, access to healthcare, a space\u2019s potential to be or not favorable to health, or looking for environmental determinants in the occurrence of a pathology. Spatial analysis, through the study of closeness, spread, spatial interaction, self-correlation, interpolation, progress and accessibility, is naturally at the center of this research. We wanted to find out how research work carried out on this theme has evolved with the passing time. To do so, we have opted for analyzing the way space is broached in the articles of the International Journal of Health Geographics, a benchmark journal on health geographics and geo-informatics fields. The material for this study was the corpus of articles published between the date when the journal was created and the present day.",

Subsequently, the title and abstract were integrated into a utility software enabling one to carry out a lexical analysis of the corpus, essentially from the most frequent words (TagCrowd) [1\u20133]. We only integrated the articles\u2019 titles and abstracts into the utility, because we considered that they were good indicators of the main words used in the text, bearing in mind that they synthesize the article\u2019s object. Representation is by means of a tag cloud. Words with the same root as space\u2014like spatial\u2014are merged in our request. We requested that the hundred most used words appear, as well as their frequency. We broke up the analysis period (13 years) into three temporally homogeneous sub-periods (2002\u20132005, 2006\u20132010 and 2011\u20132015).",

Actually, the first article written by the journal\u2019s founder is about retrieving metadata contained in web files in order to produce interactive maps [4], just like another in 2003 by the same author [5]. This goes hand in hand with the georeferencing of data, in particular data on cancer, and the development of spatial analysis tools [6]. In that period, spatial analysis is essentially used with a view to detecting clusters: \u201cWe were able to pinpoint geographic areas with higher risk through exploratory spatial analyses, and to assess temporal variability of the risk surfaces, thus providing a working hypothesis on breast cancer and environmental exposures\u201d [7], see also [8]. Then the authors wonder about the best statistical methods for detecting clusters. For example, in the article headed A flexibly shaped scan statistic for detecting clusters, Tango and Takahashi question Kulldorff\u2019s statistic which uses a circular window, and put forward another method to approach non-circular clusters (along a road or a river, for example) [9]. Researchers also look into comparing methods and statistical models\u2014Comparison of spatial scan statistic and spatial filtering in estimating low birth weight [10], or rather in their combination so as to produce reliable results [11]. GISs are considered as likely to play an important part in following up and understanding the spread of an epidemic of the SARS type in 2003. They allow one to go very far, up to identifying infected buildings that could then be avoided [12].",

Thus, in the article referred to, places conducive to falling down have been identified in a particularly dense Hong Kong neighborhood (MongKok), such as the proximity of underground stations, the junctions of congested streets, traffic lights with too short a time reserved for pedestrians to cross, street edges badly adapted to easy walking, or a sudden and abrupt change of curb. In Geospatial examination of lithium in drinking water and suicide mortality [21], it even seems that in some spaces, the suicide rate is lower than national average owing to the natural presence of a certain concentration of lithium in public water, which is a regulator of emotions.",

Here, environmental determinants designate the physical and climatic characteristics of the spaces being studied. In order to understand the place of these environmental factors, a logistic regression model is used, the dependent variable being the virus infection status (infected/non-infected), and the explanatory variables being environmental determinants provided by teledetection, such as for example the presence of wetlands. The model helps to underline the part of the environment which explains the risk of being infected by the virus. Subsequently, this model can be used as a predictive model so as to assess the probability of future cases. So, here space is perceived as an actor having variable physical and climatic characteristics both in time and space, which plays a determining role in the transmission of the vectorial disease and explains its uneven (spatial and temporal) distribution. Thus, studying the environmental characteristics of the space being studied makes it possible to better understand and predict the spatial variability of the risk of transmission.",

Here the parasite is Toxoplasma gondii, which is responsible for toxoplasmosis and is excreted in the environment by infected cats (the definitive host) and rodents (intermediate host). The spatial distribution of farms (where cats find shelter) and the distance to the nearest farm could, among others, serve as a medium for the spread of the parasite, and explain high levels of contamination. The risk of contamination is higher if farms are inside a village than if they are scattered. Model entities are cats, rodents, farm buildings and environment cells, each agent and cell being characterized by a state of contamination and specific rules (for example, population dynamic, activity or mobility for the hosts).",

This paper is interesting in so far as it proposes an original method to analyze the risk of malaria that can be used as a support for intervention measures. The method is based on a regionalization process. In the paper, results (an index of vulnerability to malaria in the eastern part of sub-Saharan Africa) are visualized by a constructed geographical unit named \u201cgeon\u201d. The idea is to offer an alternative to MAUP with a data aggregation method that does not take into account administrative limits or cell grids when data are gridded. The very choice of aggregated data and their regionalization is a process which has a direct influence on the modeling and representation of the variability of the phenomenon being studied.",

Here the term \u201cevent\u201d must be understood as a geographic phenomenon occurring at a specific point from a trigger threshold, for example when a certain air pollution threshold is reached. Smart cities were even the subject of a thematic collection of four articles [30\u201333] published in the journal on January 31, 2015, headed \u201cSmart healthy cities and regions\u201d. What emerges from these is that smart cities, because they are able to act simultaneously on numerous health determinants\u2014for example via a better knowledge of the environment (urban monitoring) and their social action in favor of the elderly (to break their isolation and maintain their autonomy) -, would contribute to reducing health inequalities, even social inequalities among people. Thus, the Internet of Things [31] would be much more than just objects internet-connected through technology, and would make individuals fully in control of their health via, for example, crowdsourcing [32] and feedbacks on noisy environments, love-clean streets, and also more responsible for their health (connected watches, exergames that require physical exercises and make them more attractive for people tending to be sedentary [33]).

Some are centered on data-related methodological difficulties, whether these are linked to geo-referencing or cartographic representation, for example they are about how difficult it is to have access to Gis data on a fine scale in some rural regions, and how useful it is then to rely on previously trained community health workers in order to obtain data on the repartition of safe water for people in northern Rwanda [37]. These articles also deal with the development of pertinent cartographic approaches to represent, for example, the risk linked to natural-focal diseases [38], or for better distributing healthcare resources in developing countries [39]. The scale of work seems to be different, the areas being bigger at a regional scale [40] or national [41], it is more about assessing or comparing health systems [42], access to healthcare [43] or health situations [44], transposing methods from a country to another rather than within a limited space where one tries to evaluate one\u2019s ability to act on its inhabitants. The foregoing can partly explain the appearance of the terms countries, facilities and services in these articles.",

The term neighborhood is also frequently used to evaluate a food environment [47], or a walkability environment (Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale-NEWS) [48]. Certain authors resort to this term when studying the impact of a socio-economically disadvantaged environment on the health of its residents [49]. As for the word area, it is used in place of the word space to observe new geographic areas where certain viruses (arboviruses) spread, triggered by climate changes and notably dryer conditions [50], or to specify the scale of particular studies [51, 52]. Finally, we note the incorporation of geographical factors such as altitude, the number of hours of sunshine, relative humidity, temperatures or rainfalls in neural network models in order to measure their impact of the Eyrythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) [53]. These articles can be backed by cohort studies to find out whether there could be a connection between a long stay in the south-east of the United States and chronic kidney disease, and whether this connection may differ depending on the ethnic group [54].",

Because of limitations inherent to TagCrowd, and in particular memory capacity (5 megabyte), it has not been possible to create a tag cloud including all titles and abstracts of all 359 articles selected. Therefore, we have drawn a chart representing the 40 most frequently used words (over 200 times in the whole corpus) which are also found in each period (Fig. 5). This longitudinal view (2002\u20132015) of the words used in the corpus clearly confirms that the terms most used between 2002 and 2005 (spatial, health, cancer, clusters and maps) are even most frequently so in the following period (2006\u20132010), but much less recently (2011\u20132015). It is interesting to note that only the words model, neighborhood and environment are used more recently in comparison with other periods. The use of three words fluctuated greatly between 2006 and 2015, the words cancer and clusters were used less frequently (\u221287, \u2212173), and conversely the word model was used more frequently (+210).",

We can see on this chart that although the terms cluster and cancer have evolved in parallel with the passing time (apart from a slight decoupling between the two curves, where the term cluster seems to be used independently from studies on cancer, for example in data relating to congenital malformations [55]), these two terms are less and less used these days, contrary to the term model which seems to be used more and more frequently. Indeed, although the detection of clusters is effective for infectious diseases, it seems to be less successful in the case of cancer. This can be explained by the fact that cancer is indubitably a multifactorial disease. Therefore, it is difficult to draw one or several causes that are easily identifiable and explanatory. Thus, researchers may detect cancer clusters in different environmental expositions. Few significant results have come out of such studies [56], and for this reason research on clusters associated to cancer tends to slow down. At present, research extends both to other types of modeling and to numerous themes other than cancer, as shown in Fig. 7 which represents an extract of a KIWC analysis carried out on the word model, which contributes to diversifying approaches in health geographics.",

Our aim was to emphasize that this field of research is vast, and that beyond the subjects studied, it contributes to a revival of geography via the extension of problems such as MAUP, the visualization of data, issues of ethics and protection of individuals, in particular in regard to the explosion of detailed and geolocated data. In view of the richness of this fast-expanding field, we wished to encourage young geographers to work on these health issues, because there is still so much to do.",
