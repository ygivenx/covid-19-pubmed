Recent studies showed that atypical pathogens are also important cause of LRTI resulting in mild to life threatening illness, which should be obtained more attention. The most common atypical pathogens include Mycoplasma pneumonia(M. pneumophila), Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumonia) and respiratory viruses [2]. These atypical pathogens were listed as common agents of CAP in American Community-acquired Pneumonia Diagnosis and treatment guidelines in Adult (2007) and Chinese Community-acquired Pneumonia Management Guidelines in Children (trial, 2007).",

M. pneumoniae is a frequent cause of hospitalization among children as young as 2 years of age and can even necessitate ventilatory assistance. L. pneumophila can occur across all age groups, but C. pneumoniae has emerged as an important cause of pneumonia in both adults and children as young as 2 years old. Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii) is the etiologic agent of Q fever, a known pathogen that causes fever, pneumonia, and intravascular infections [5,6]. Studies of CAP have traditionally focused little on viral causes[2]. Currently, viral infections are also involved with 80% of episodes of CAP in children under 2 years old and over 40% of older children [6\u201311]. The existing studies have showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses (Flu) are important pathogens among the hospitalized and outpatient children presenting with ARTI [5, 6].Adenovirus virus (ADV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are also associated with a substantial proportion of ALRI in infants and young children [7\u20139].",

Therefore, rapid, sensitive diagnostic methods and pathogen-directed therapy are important. However, Regarding atypical pathogens are difficult to isolate, conventional culture methods require longer test times and a facility able to perform these tests. In addition, the appropriate sample is critical for the aetiologic diagnosis. Sputum, representing lower-airway secretions, can rarely be obtained from children [2,7]. New rapid detection of multiple viruses and bacteria has been developed lately [8,9]. IgM antibody first appeared in the process of infection, but the last time not long. So it was regarded as diagnostic criteria of early infection. Specific IgM appeared in one week, peak within three weeks after infections, thus more valuable for early diagnosis in children based on Chinese Expert Consensus of Diagnosis and Treatment of Mycoplasma Pneumoniae in Children.",

Interestingly, recent studies have provided statistical evidence that co-infection is not random, and that co-infection occurs more frequently with certain pathogens than with others. However, Studies designed to identify multiple pathogens simultaneously are limited, and information regarding mixed infections is lacking in China.

Whether infection by one agent facilitates infection of the same pathogen or other pathogens in cells is still uncertain. We revealed a linear relationship between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogens infections. The k coefficients showed no significant differences according to pathogen, month, or age group. We may use the k coefficient as a constant in further studies.
