A study of the etiology of severe childhood pneumonia was undertaken in the coastal area of The Gambia (Supplementary Appendix 1). At the time of the study (2007\u20132009), there was high coverage with conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine but no routine usage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which is the case currently in many African countries. Cases were children aged 2\u201359 months with severe pneumonia defined clinically by modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (cough or difficulty in breathing, plus any of the following: lower chest wall indrawing, nasal flaring, or an oxygen saturation of <90% on pulse oximetry). Participants were recruited from the Medical Research Council (MRC) hospital in Fajara; the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital in Banjul; and the major health centers at Fajikunda, Serekunda, and Brikama. Children with a cough of \u22652 weeks, or severe anemia (hemoglobin level <6 g/dL) or confirmed wheeze were excluded. Radiological pneumonia was defined using WHO criteria (ie, endpoint consolidation or pleural effusion). HIV testing was done if informed consent was given after standard counseling. A standard WHO guideline\u2013based antibiotic regimen was used. Written informed consent was obtained for participation in the study from parents or guardians. The study was approved by the Gambian government/MRC Joint Ethics Committee (SCC/EC1062).",

Multiple assays have provided several lines of supporting evidence, and 2 laboratories analyzed the raw clinical specimens, strengthening the findings. The predominance of S. pneumoniae along with its serotype distribution is supported by a high level of concordance between independent laboratories [19]. The study's weaknesses are that the best possible specimens are still subject to sampling error, that the study is relatively small, and that the identification of potential pathogens does not in itself confirm that these are the causative agents, a fundamental challenge for the field. Nevertheless, if there are any clinical samples for which pathogen detection alone is sufficient to assign causation, then these are lung and pleural aspirates.",

This study also confirms that molecular methods are able to detect potential pathogens far more readily than culture and have a role in defining the etiology of pneumonia. The challenge of accurately assigning causation to the pathogens detected remains, particularly when using more generally available specimen types, and this will require the additional development of robust biomarkers of pathogen-specific disease.",
