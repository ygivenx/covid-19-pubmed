Investigations were directed to the epidemiology, etiology, morphology, and treatment of BEN. Results of these studies were reviewed elsewhere [2, 3]. BEN has an onset of between the 40s and 60s, with a long preclinical period. The disease affects both genders with slight female predominance and often leads to terminal kidney failure. About 30\u201340% of the affected individuals develop uroepithelial tumours of the upper urinary tract [4]. These are mostly papillar carcinomas and are the most common causes of death in BEN patients.",

Pathomorphologically BEN has similarities with Chinese herbal nephropathy, which is probably caused by the toxic effect of aristolochic acid, but there is no evidence supporting this theory for BEN. Other possible agents involved in the etiology of BEN are ochratoxin A and some viruses such as picornavirus, polyomavirus, herpes simplex 1 and 2, adenovirus, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus [5, 6].

Epigenetic changes over time display familial clustering [14] and could be implicated in transmitting a \u201cpredisposition\u201d over generations. Epigenetic modifications being heritable and adaptable at the same time may prove to make a significant contribution to BEN development and may be the link between the effect of environmental factors and genetic composition in BEN progression. In a previous study we have investigated the methylation status across the whole genome in different patient groups, based on gender and endemic region, in comparison to healthy controls from nonendemic regions. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were determined in BEN patient and controls and the commonly presented DMRs were determined to be the most promising methylation alterations in BEN. SEC61G, IL17RA, and HDAC11 proved to be differently methylated throughout all patient-control pairs [15].",

Most of the molecular studies so far have focused on single genes/polymorphisms and very limited information has been provided. Because gene-by-gene analysis by Sanger sequencing is too laborious and expensive, genetic testing has been the exception until recently. Now, next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for simultaneous and efficient analysis of all known genes for a given trait. Here we applied exome sequencing (comprised of 22 000 genes) in 22 BEN patients in order to detect the most prominent genetic variants with highly probable pathological effect. Recently Poon et al. have applied whole-genome and exome sequencing for analysis of Aristolochic acid- (AA-) associated upper urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma (UTUC) [20]. AA is a carcinogen that can cause nephrotoxicity as well. Authors observed a high frequency of somatic mutations in chromatin modifiers, particularly KDM6A, in AA-UTUC, demonstrated the sufficiency of AA to induce renal dysplasia in mice, and reproduced the AA mutational signature in experimentally treated human renal tubular cells.

Cukuranovic et al. have intensively studied the pathological changes in the kidneys of BEN patients and presented evidence that renal vascular changes occur early in Balkan nephropathy [30]. They detected by IHC a marked overexpression of laminin in renal interstitial capillaries. The pattern of laminin staining in glomeruli corresponded to focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis present in the advanced stages of Balkan nephropathy. Later stages were characterized by an intensive expression of laminin in atrophic tubules, much more in proximal than in distal ones. The coexpression of vimentin and cytokeratin in proximal tubular cells was also demonstrated.

Tumor angiogenesis, chicken angiogenesis, and mesenteric angiogenesis data suggest that elastin and elastin degradation products play a key role in vascular morphogenesis. CELA1 was expressed in vascular cells in the embryonic lung and in a fetal mesenchymal cell line with angiogenic properties [32]. Degraded elastin causes deposition of hydroxyapatite-like mineral and osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (as they lose the specific \u03b1-SMA), resulting in vascular calcification [33]. In contrast, collagen-1 levels in areas of calcification are increasing [34]. Changes in both \u03b1-SMA and elastin inversely correlate with the hemodynamic parameters such as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and lead to media remodeling. This was associated with the increased arterial stiffness observed in CKD rats with vascular calcification. Dysregulation of normal anticalcification factors and elastin degradation represent a pattern of vascular injury existing in patients with end-stage renal diseases [35].",

Potassium channels in the kidney play an essential role in controlling and maintaining plasma potassium levels in the normal range, as well as exerting very different functions such as cell volume control, membrane potential stabilization and excitability, or regulation of hormone or ion secretion [36\u201339]. In addition, potassium ion (K+) channel activity is a major regulator of vascular muscle cell membrane potential and is therefore an important determinant of vascular tone. There is growing evidence that the function of several types of vascular K+ channels is altered during major cardiovascular diseases, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis [40]. Defects in potassium channels cause abnormal vasodilation responses reflecting a gradual deterioration of vascular mechanisms during the progression of diabetic nephropathy [41]. Enhanced dilator responses and basal activation of K+ channels may occur in the renal circulation early during diabetes. An increased K+ channel activity may therefore reflect a very high metabolic state of vascular smooth muscle cells [42].",

As blood vessels nourish all the tissues and organs in the body, abnormal formation and remodeling of blood vessels probably contribute to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. Neoangiogenesis is a complex process of recruitment, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis of stem/progenitor cells, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and other mural cells. The extracellular matrix plays important roles in vessel development via providing a supportive matrix scaffold and growth factors for cells. Close interactions between vascular cells and their ECM is crucial in blood vessel formation and remodeling. Our results suggest three new genes for predisposition to BEN pathology, related to angiogenic alterations. We hypothesize that mutations in HSPG2, CELA1, and KCNK5 participate in extracellular matrix modifications, arterial media remodeling, and regulation of vascular tone, all these events leading to interstitial vessel remodeling, connected to renal interstitial fibrosis in BEN (Figure 4). Further elucidation of molecular pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis could lead to the development of a new target therapy of BEN by targeting specific angiogenic factors. Our results provide a basis for further investigations of the role of the nominated genes in BEN kidney pathology, including screening for variants in the nominated genes in a larger cohort of patients. Herein we suggest a possible mechanism between the three candidate genes and BEN.",

The increase of the cortical interstitial volume results in resistance of the postglomerular capillary network with impairment of the glomerular flow [43]. This impairment leads to chronic rise in hydrostatic pressure. The increase of the cortical interstitium additionally leads to an increase in the length of diffusion between the tubules and the intertubular and peritubular capillaries. This increase in the length of diffusion subsequently results in the atrophy of the tubules, reduction of reabsorbtion, and therefore impairment of the effective filtration pressure. The haemodynamic changes inversely correlate with \u03b1-SMA and elastin in vessels and here could be the additional pathogenic role of mutated CELA1 gene. The mutated KCNK5 gene is probably a factor stimulating the haemodynamics-driven vascular remodeling.",
