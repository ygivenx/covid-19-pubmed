Our classification was consistent with the classification in the pVOG database in all 98.6% of the cases.

To identify putative false positives, i.e. circular contigs that do not represent complete genomes, these circular contigs were affiliated first to ICTV genera (or families for ssDNA and RNA viruses) based on the presence of taxonomic marker VOGs (http://vogdb.org/) (Roux et al., in press, Nature Biotech). VOG-based affiliations required \u22652 consistent VOG markers except for NCLDV where \u22655 markers were required, and for ssDNA and RNA viruses for which one marker was required. Alternatively, circular contigs were affiliated to genus-level groups including Viral RefSeq genomes using vContact2 (https://bitbucket.org/MAVERICLab/vcontact2) (15). For circular contigs grouped with isolated reference genomes, contigs with a length <80% of the minimum reference size of the group were considered as a false positive. For circular contigs in genus-level groups without any isolate, any circular contig with a length <80% of the maximum linear contig in the group was considered as a false positive. In addition, all circular contigs <10 kb and without any marker gene affiliation to a ssDNA or RNA virus genome were considered as false positives, as they likely originate from dsDNA virus genomes. Overall, 4166 circular contigs were considered as false-positive, and were analyzed as linear contigs for the purpose of completeness estimation (see below).",

Otherwise, linear contigs were affiliated to genus-level groups including Viral RefSeq genomes and circular contigs predicted as complete genomes (see above) using vContact2. For each genus-level group, an average genome length was first calculated based only on isolates and circular contigs. If the standard deviation of genome length in this group was \u226415% of the average genome length, this average was considered as the predicted genome size for all linear contigs in this group, as in (4).

Second, we used matches between viral sequences and the microbial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system, which hijacks small (from 25 to 65 base pairs) viral sequences and stores them within the microbial CRISPR arrays as spacers (21). This approach led to host prediction for 37 656 UViGs (including 4707 vOTUsand 7456 singletons). In total, we connected 49 bacterial and archaeal phyla and candidate phyla to viral sequences (Table 1).

To help users separate complete and near-complete viral genomes from short fragments, we applied a genome completeness estimation method to classify viral sequences by genome quality according to community proposed standards (Roux et al., in press, Nature Biotech). Briefly, circular contigs are considered putative complete genomes, with spurious matches removed based on their comparison to the closest isolate reference genome. Linear contigs are first clustered along with circular contigs and isolate reference genomes into genus-level groups. If the sizes of complete genomes from a genus-level group are consistent, the average size of these complete genomes is used as a \u2018predicted genome size\u2019 for all linear contigs in this group. In total, IMG/VR contains 11 220 finished isolate virus genomes (iVGs), with an additional 14 644 circular UViG contigs identified as likely complete genomes. A total of 15 505 linear contigs were classified as \u2018high-quality draft genomes\u2019 based on their estimated completeness of \u226590%, while the remaining 719 084 linear contigs were classified as \u2018genome fragments\u2019 due to their low completeness (n = 188 377) or lack of predicted genome size (n = 522 731) (Figure 2). Although this classification is based entirely on in silico predictions and would require in vitro experiments and/or isolation of the virus to ascertain genome completeness, this information is still valuable for users who want to focus their research on complete or near-complete predicted viral genomes.",

Since the initial release, the IMG/VR content has tripled in size with over 755 000 viral genomes and genome fragments. Considering the number of newly identified UViGs and the growth of vOTUs, we project that the number of viral sequences hosted in IMG/VR will continue to grow superlinearly. We anticipate that this increase over time, however, will not affect the database infrastructure nor the system capabilities, since it only represents a small fraction of the original IMG/M total data. In this release, we have updated and added a number of features that expand the functionality of the resource. First, IMG/VR v.2.0 now adheres to community-accepted standards and best practices to characterize genome sequences from uncultivated viruses, including terminology (e.g. UViGs, vOTUs) and genome clustering methodology. Second, we have improved the virus-host predictions through the addition of curated prophage sequences to the clustering step and expanded the microbial CRISPR spacer database by 35%. In addition, we have classified 65% of the sequences into prokaryotic or eukaryotic viruses. Third, we have estimated the quality of the UViGs based on their predicted genome completeness. Fourth, we provide visualization in Google Maps of the sample(s) location from which we select virus genomes or genome fragments.

            "text": "Future versions of IMG/VR will boost the data content by adding other predicted viral genomes and genome fragments not easily captured by our current detection pipeline. For example, viral contigs <5 kb are currently filtered out to minimize the rate of false positive predictions. However, this step may also remove many ssDNA viruses (29). Moreover, most NucleoCytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs) are also filtered out by our current pipeline due to their high number of metabolic genes (30) and the lack of reference genomes when the VPFs were originated. Other virus groups such as virophages are also difficult to identify due to their clear underrepresentation in the databases (31). The development of methods specifically targeting the above viral types, as well as RNA viruses, which can be found in metatranscriptomic samples. We envision IMG/VR as a comprehensive, dynamic, and interactive platform eventually including all types of viruses. Additionally, we plan to improve and expand the host-virus assignments by using a combination of homology-based searches of specific genes and kmer-based machine learning approaches (32,33).",
