Many important infectious diseases persist on a knife-edge: rapid rates of transmission coupled with brief infectious periods. Such violent epidemic behavior has been observed in plague [4], cholera [5], pertussis [6] and more recently Hepatitis E. The recent outbreak of Hepatitis E in northern Uganda, has left many dead and a number of infectives that continue to spread the infection [7]. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with the Hepatitis E virus (HEV) which has a fecal-oral transmission route. It is a self-limiting disease but occasionally develops into an acute severe liver disease. As emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases increase in outbreak frequency, there is a compelling interest in understanding their dynamics [8]\u2013[10].",

Malaria has been shown to disarm the immune system and increase susceptibility to viral infections such as HIV [11]. Recently, in a 3-month follow-up study the pattern of co-infection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and acute Hepatitis A (HAV), in 222 Kenyan children under the age of 5 years was observed [12]. The incidence of HAV infections during P. falciparum malaria was found to be 6.3 times higher than the cumulative incidence of HAV, suggesting that co-infection of the two pathogens may result from changes in host susceptibility. There is also evidence both for [13], [14] and against [15], [16] an association between Hepatitis B viruses and malaria. HEV transmission route is similar to the Hepatitis A virus and thus for HEV it is important to consider possible links to co-infection with malaria. This can be done using mathematical models of multiple pathogens [17]\u2013[22].",

The dynamics of the disease are an SEIR framework, i.e. Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered. Hepatitis E virus is mainly spread by the fecal-oral route. This results either from directly touching the contaminated environment and eat without washing hands, or drinking contaminated water. In Kitgum district Uganda, most people live in internally displaced camps. The number of latrines in the area are not enough for the entire population, [11], and people use the local environment for this purpose. When rain falls, it washes the faeces into water bodies. In the Kitgum region, few people have access to clean bore hole water [11], and therefore collect water from the contaminated water sources. To model this phenomenon we use l, to denote the proportion of households in Kitgum with access to latrines. Therefore, the rate of change of contamination c of the environment is given by(1)where  is the transmission rate of HEV from the infected human, I, to the environment.",
