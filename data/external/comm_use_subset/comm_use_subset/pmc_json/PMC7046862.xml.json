            "text": "Budget constraints and shifting political priorities have long posed challenges for global health research funding. Global health research is defined as not only supporting health research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but also focusing on \u201chealth, health-system, health inequities, and health policy challenges facing populations living in conditions of vulnerability\u201d in both LMICs and high-income countries (HICs) (Global health research 2017). In the wake of Brexit and the 2016 United States (US) election, a new uncertainty has set in about whether the United Kingdom (UK) and the US will maintain their historic levels of support for global health research initiatives (Greenwood 2018). Global development assistance for health has grown by only 1.2% annually since 2010, a sharp drop from the 11.3% annual increases seen throughout the 2000s, and continued limitations on growth are expected (Dieleman et al. 2016). Globally, public funding of global health research has declined since the global financial crisis of 2008 (Chapman et al. 2016); existing analyses show that only a small percentage of global health research funds are allocated towards epidemiology and health policy and systems research, which is context-specific research that is especially important for LMICs (Abimbola et al. 2017). Many observers worry about continued reductions in research funding opportunities for global health, as populist pressures may encourage countries to shift resources towards domestic priorities (Morrison 2012). This global shortfall runs counter to the \u201cconvergence plan\u201d of The Lancet\u2019s Global Health 2035 Commission, which calls for doubling research funding for diseases that disproportionately affect LMICs from US$3 billion to US$6 billion per year so that health status in LMICs can catch up to HICs within a generation (Ramesh 2013). In light of these challenges, other countries, even if smaller in influence and capacity, will increasingly be shaping global health research priorities alongside existing major funders.",

For example, researchers in Canada conducted the world\u2019s largest randomized trial on breastfeeding interventions, which influenced World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (Patel et al. 2013). Evidence-based medicine was introduced into clinical practice in the 1990s by Canadian doctors at McMaster University (Smith and Rennie 2014). The University of Waterloo\u2019s International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project was the first international research program to evaluate the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\u2019s provisions (International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project n.d.).

Collectively, IDRC and GCC fund more global health research than CIHR; at their peaks in 2012/2013, IDRC invested C$16 million and GCC invested C$54 million in global health research (Plamondon et al. 2017).

For example, the scope of infection and immunity and population and public health are often transnational, equity-focused, and targeted to reach populations facing conditions of marginalization both in LMICs and across multiple international settings. CIHR-funded research for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 health has mostly been domestic in focus, with the relevant Institute\u2019s mandate being to \u201cimprove and promote the health of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples in Canada\u201d, whereas IPPH and CIHR\u2019s Institute of Infection and Immunity have defined mandates that are global in scope (see Table 1).",

Second, the data were independently validated twice: first by staff at CIHR\u2019s IPPH and International Relations Team and second by our research team to minimize false positives. Third, steps were taken to increase the comparability of grants between years by adjusting for inflation and standardizing grant values to 2015 Canadian dollars. Fourth, this analysis is particularly informative for CIHR\u2019s global health research strategy\u2014which is especially important as CIHR is Canada\u2019s largest health research funder broadly and for Canada-based global health researchers specifically.

A search yielded more than 4700 unique keywords from the global health research dataset alone. This made further analysis on topics that would require information from the keyword metadata extremely labour-intensive due to risks of double-counting. For example, when analyzing the infectious disease research funding data, HIV/AIDS research was found to be coded under multiple variations: \u201cHIV\u201d, \u201cAIDS\u201d, \u201chuman immunodeficiency virus\u201d, including their French-language equivalents of \u201cVIH\u201d, \u201cSIDA\u201d, and \u201cvirus de l'immunod\u00e9ficience humaine\u201d. Grants could also support projects involving more than one infectious disease; accordingly, double-counting could not be avoided (whereas all other analyses in this study were conducted using mutually exclusive categories to avoid any double-counting). The infectious diseases analysis therefore should be viewed as a preliminary analysis of trends rather than accurate magnitude. Future analyses would benefit from a standardized keyword classification scheme currently being considered by CIHR for its database. Second, the CIHR grants dataset had some missing information in two categories\u2014institute research area and research theme\u2014as they were both self-declared by grant applicants with options to be omitted. Data quality would be improved for these categories if CIHR required responses to them. Third, there was no feasible way to check CIHR\u2019s funding database for false negatives, meaning there could theoretically be additional global health research grants within CIHR\u2019s funding portfolio if CIHR\u2019s IPPH or Strategic Partnerships and International Relations Team accidentally made mistakes when classifying grants as global health research.",
