Most of the Lycoris species are commonly cultivated in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam as bulbous plants [1], [2]. In comparison with other well-known bulb flowers, such as narcissi and lilies, Lycoris has its own characteristics and merits. It comes into flower at a time when few other bulbous plants are active. The flowers are characterized by their pastel and plentiful colors as well as by beautiful and varied shapes [1]. So the Lycoris species are all very popular with considerable acceptance as ornamental plant [3] and most of them have been successfully cultivated. In the past several decades, some of the Lycoris species, cultivars, and hybrids such as Lycoris radiata and Lycoris aurea have been used worldwide. Meanwhile, the demand for Lycoris as a commercial horticultural product has been increasing steadily, so the breeding of varieties with new flower forms and/or colors has become desirable for Lycoris.",

The bulbs of Lycoris have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for a long time and some Amaryllidaceae-type alkaloids isolated from these plants have been reported to exhibit immunostimulatory, anti-tumor, anti-viral and anti-malarial activities [4]\u2013[7]. For example, lycorine, a pyrrolophenanthridine alkaloid, has been demonstrated to suppress cell growth of the human leukemia cell line HL-60 [8] as well as the multiple myeloma cell line KM3 [9] by arresting the cell cycle, subsequently inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. More recently, lycorine causes a rapid turnover of protein levels of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), which may play an important survival role in a variety of tumor cells including leukemia were reported [10]. So lycorine might be a good candidate therapeutic agent against leukemia. Additionally, it has also been reported that lycorine was an active component in the alkaloid portion and a good candidate for the development of new antiviral medicine in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [11]. Galanthamine, another major Amaryllidaceae alkaloid, has also been widely used in medicine as a strong reversible inhibitor of cholinesterase to increase acetylcholine sensitivity [12]. It is a specific remedy for myasthenia gravis and poliomyelitis sequela and has also been used in the therapy of glaucoma [13] and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [13]\u2013[15]. Hence, galanthamine also has important medicinal value and broad application prospect [16]. At the same time, because of their several biological activities and their potential diversity in pharmacology, Amaryllidaceae alkaloids have also attracted great interest of synthetic organic chemists [17]\u2013[25].",

They have played significant roles in functional genomics research for discovery of novel genes together with identifying different protein groups (e.g. proteins with signal peptides) other than the whole genome [27]\u2013[29], developing SSRs and SNPs markers [30]\u2013[34], allowing large-scale expression analysis [35], improving genome annotation [36], and elucidating phylogenetic relationships [37].",

By generating sufficiently long sequence reads, Roche 454 pyrosequencing using Genome Sequencing (GS) FLX technology makes it possible to compensate for the lack of a reference genome during de novo sequence assembly with the concurrent improvements of de novo assembly software [39]. Meanwhile, it is particularly useful as a shotgun method for generating EST data and a powerful method for whole genome transcriptome analysis and gene discovery with pyrosequencing of uncloned cDNAs [40]. So far, a large number of plants [26], [34], [40]\u2013[42] including Arabidopsis [43], Artemisia annua\n[44], cucumber [45], Medicago\n[46], maize [47], barley [48] and Jatropha curcas (Barbados Nut) [49] have been performed for transcriptome analyses by Roche 454 pyrosequencing. Also, many EST libraries of a wide range of plant species have been constructed for genes involved in plant growth and differentiation [46], [50], biochemical pathways [47], [48], secondary metabolism [51], [52] as well as responses to environmental stresses and pathogen attack [53].",

            "text": "The goal of this study was to characterize the transcriptome of L. aurea in Lycoris species using high-throughput Roche 454 pyrosequencing. As one of the Amaryllidaceae plants, L. aurea is an indigenous and popular ornamental herb in China [54]. It is well-known not only for the high economic value in horticulture but also for the alkaloids it produces, among which galanthamine and lycorine are the major ingredients [55], [56]. In recent years, studies have reported that L. aurea is a good material for extraction of galantamine and other alkaloids [55], [57]. However, little research has been performed to address the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids biosynthesis-related genes (especially for galanthamine biosynthesis). Additionally, to date, there are only less than 9,000 ESTs available for Lycoris. And limited by the availability of genomic information, studies of Lycoris have mainly focused on karyotypes analysis 1,3,58,59, morphology [60], medicine [11], [13]\u2013[15], and molecular aspect [2], [61]\u2013[64]. Hence, determination of the genetic pathways and specific genes involved in Amaryllidaceae alkaloids biosynthesis and some other aspects of Lycoris could be beneficial for humans and enrich our knowledge and understanding of functional genomics and biological research. Transcriptome sequencing might provide such a useful tool. After preparing a cDNA library by pooling total RNA from various organs and tissues, including leaves with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), salicylic acid (SA), or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, stems and flowers at the bud, blooming, and wilting stages, we sequenced ESTs from this library. The transcriptome sequences were then annotated by BLASTing against public databases. Subsequently, the annotated sequences were clustered into putative functional categories using the Gene Ontology (GO) framework and grouped into pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). This transcriptome dataset represents the first exploration of L. aurea and provides an invaluable new resource for functional genomics and biological research in L. aurea. The results described herein provide a material basis for future genetic linkage and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis and may serve to guide further gene express and functional genomic research in future.",

It has been reported that in some plants of Amaryllidaceae family, the improved production of galanthamine was examined in MeJA-treated tissues and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)-treated somatic embryos respectively [65], [66]. And in our previous study, we also found that the content of galanthamine in Lycoris chinensis and Lycoris radiata seedlings would have been affected after treating with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), salicylic acid (SA), or MeJA [67], [68]. For the purpose of improving mRNA abundance of genes related to Amaryllidaceae alkaloids biosynthesis, the leaves were treated with those abiotic elicitors for RNA extraction. Quality of the RNA as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and OD260/OD280 ratio (2.0 \u00b1 0.10) was found to be suitable for cDNA synthesis. After that, equal quantities of RNA from different samples were mixed together and normalized cDNA was synthesised. It has been reported that normalization of the cDNA greatly reduces the frequency of abundant transcripts, and increases the rate recovery of unique transcripts [69]. After subjecting to quality control experiment, the normalized cDNA was used to construct a cDNA library. Then the library was sequenced by a Roche 454 GS FLX.",

The reads produced by the Roche 454 GS FLX were used for clustering and de novo assembly. After eliminating primer and adapter sequences and filtering out the low-quality reads, a total of 937,990 high-quality transcriptomic raw sequence reads with a total size of 308,633,593 bp were obtained. Size distribution of these reads is shown in Figure 1A. Length of these reads ranged between 150 and 854 bases with an average length of 329 bp per read (Figure 1A). Clustering and assembly of these raw reads was done using GS de novo assembler [70], [71]. This assembler can assemble the data under genomic or cDNA option. After clustering and assembly, a non-redundant set of 141,111 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), comprising 24,604 contigs and 116,507 singletons, respectively (Table 1) were obtained. Most of these contigs (95.04%) were distributed in the 200\u223c1,400 bp region (Figure 1B). And most of these singletons fell between 161 and 500 bp in length (Figure 1C). So far, the number of ESTs that are available from Lycoris is less than 9,000. Recently, by sequencing clones from three non-normalized cDNA libraries, 32,521 EST sequences were obtained and most of them were used for floral transcription factors prediction from Lycoris longituba\n[64]. Therefore, this transcriptome dataset provides a useful resource for future analyses of genes related to Amaryllidaceae alkaloids synthesis.

The L. aurea contigs were further assembled into 16,828 isogroups (all the splice variants of individual transcripts). More contigs than isogroups were found because some contigs (called isotigs, 24,463) are attributed to the same isogroups due to alternative splicing. A large number of alternative splicing could improve the utilization rate of the encoding genes. Alternative splicing is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells, and it contributes to protein diversity.",

At present, over 100 alkaloids have been isolated from different Amaryllidaceae plants [75], although their structures vary considerably, these alkaloids are considered to be biogenetically related. Mainly, the large numbers of structurally diverse Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are classified into 9 skeleton types, for which the representative alkaloids are: norbelladine, lycorine, homolycorine, crinine, haemanthamine, arciclasine, tazettine, montanine and galanthamine.",

Since then, studies have been reported that the biosynthesis of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids belongs to different ring type subgroups [75]\u2013[78]. And the noteworthy study could be the biosynthesis of galanthamine and related alkaloids [76]. For example, it has been considered that L-phenylalanine (L-phe) and L-tyrosine (L-tyr) would be the precursors of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids biosynthesis. Although L-phe and L-tyr are closely related in chemical structure, they are not interchangeable in plants. The presence of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) has been demonstrated in Amaryllidaceae plants [68], [79] and the elimination of ammonia mediated by this enzyme is known to occur in an antiperiplanar manner to give trans-cinnamic acid, with loss of the \u03b2-pro-S hydrogen [80]. Besides, it has been proposed that Amaryllidaceae alkaloids could be regarded as derivatives of the key intermediate 4\u2032-O-methylnorbelladine [77]. There are three different groups of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids that are biosynthesized by three modes of intramolecular oxidative phenol coupling (para-para\u2032, ortho-para\u2032 and para-para\u2032) [75], [76], [78].",

They participate in a variety of biochemical pathways to produce primary and secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, lipids, cyanogenic glycosides, and glucosinolates, as well as plant hormones [81]\u2013[84]. For example, in some kinds of plants, several P450s in the CYP80 and CYP719 families, known to catalyze reactions (such as C-O and C-C phenol-coupling reaction) atypical for P450s, function in Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) biosynthesis [85]\u2013[88].
