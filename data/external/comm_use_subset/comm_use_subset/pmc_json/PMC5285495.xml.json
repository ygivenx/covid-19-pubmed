Several studies detected MERS-CoV in camels in several countries.8, 9, 10, 11 Camel to human transmission of MERS-CoV was also documented.12, 13 Camel and human MERS-CoV had similar replication, tropism and ability to evade interferon responses, in ex vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract.

Females had consistently higher seroprevalence even when data were further analyzed by age strata. This translated into lower detection of MERS-CoV in females as compared with males. Our data does not allow us to provide a biological explanation for this observation, however, it could be potentially explained by the close link of cows and calves. As calves are more susceptible to infection, the cows become exposed to virus repeatedly, increasing their antibody titer.",

Given the size of the MERS-CoV genome, we cannot draw much conclusions on the genetic composition of Egyptian viruses based on only partial Spike sequences.

Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that re-infection of camels does happen based on increases in antibody titers. This suggests that the virus may be continuously circulating in the large herds in exporting countries. These data have implications on vaccinating camels against MERS-CoV. Any vaccination program should account for the facts that antibodies tend to wane and that camels with high antibody titers can be infected.9, 10 This is in addition to the fact that the infection appears to be more common in exporting countries from which data on camel populations are sparse. Another study demonstrated that MERS neutralizing antibodies in dairy camels in a high biosecurity level farm remained consistent for up to one year.27 This is in contrast to our serological data that showed variation of antibodies over time. This may be explained but differences in biosecurity and/or differences in the immunity of the camels given different feeding and rearing practices.",
