Although global HIV prevalence has levelled off, the total number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) is increasing steadily due to the on\u2010going acquisition of HIV infection, longer survival times of PLHIV and a growing general population.1 In Hong Kong, the HIV prevalence was low among the general population but high among some specific populations (e.g. 5.9% among men who have sex with men).2 Among the new HIV cases reported in the second quarter of Hong Kong, 86.7% were male, and 35.7%, 36.9% and 4.5% were infected through heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual contact, respectively.3 The figures are comparable to those of the UK, which shows that out of those newly diagnosed with HIV in 2015, 75% were male, and 38.1% and 56.1% were infected through heterosexual and homosexual sex contact, respectively.4 Despite the promising efforts in counteracting HIV, HIV continues to be a major public health concern in Hong Kong.",

            "text": "HIV has long been regarded as one of the most stigmatized medical conditions.5 According to Goffman,6 stigma is defined as an attribute linking a person to a set of undesirable characteristics that may lead to prejudice and discrimination. While public stigma is the reaction that the general population has to the individuals who are considered different, self\u2010stigma occurs when \u201cpeople with devalued status who internalize the discriminatory beliefs and experience diminished self\u2010esteem and self\u2010efficacy\u201d.7 Corrigan suggested that both public stigma and self\u2010stigma comprise three components: stereotype (negative belief about the group/self), prejudice (agreement with belief and/or negative emotional reaction) and discrimination (behaviour response to prejudice).8 Self\u2010stigma has further been explained by the cognitive\u2010affective\u2010behavioural model.9 According to the model, the stigmatized individuals perceive their stigmatized identity as a burden and taint of their life, which lead to negative sense of self (self\u2010stigmatizing cognitions). Such conceptions might lead to a myriad of negative affective responses, encompassing feelings of anger, fear and shame (self\u2010stigmatizing affect) which, in turn, resulting in identity concealment, social avoidance and self\u2010denigration (self\u2010stigmatizing behaviours).",

In a meta\u2010analysis of 21 studies, public stigma towards HIV/AIDS is the greatest compared to genital herpes, hepatitis, drug abuse and cancer.10 The high level of stigma towards PLHIV can be due to several causes. First, a high level of self\u2010responsibility is attached to HIV as the acquisition of HIV is due to behaviours that can be preventable, such as unsafe sex and needle sharing.11, 12 Some behaviours associated with HIV, such as same\u2010sex behaviours, are also considered immoral and are thus condemned by the society.5 Misconceptions about HIV transmission routes and overestimation of the perceived contagiousness and risks through casual contact further evoke stigmatization towards HIV.12 These cause an intensive level of blame and disapproval against PLHIV, resulting in social rejection, discrimination and prejudice.13, 14\n",

            "text": "It is contended that stigma against PLHIV is even more intense in the Chinese context, as the behaviours related to HIV infection, such as same\u2010sex behaviours, multiple sex partnership and injecting drug use, are generally perceived as defying acceptable social norms and culture.15, 16, 17 High level of ignorance, misconception and fear of HIV also contribute to the high level of stigma towards PLHIV in the Chinese context.18, 19 Furthermore, face concern, which refers to social image and social worth that are garnered based on one's performance in an interpersonal context, is particularly important in the Chinese society.20, 21 Yang and Kleinman22 proposed that while the concept of \u201cface\u201d represents social power, capital and a person's value in society, PLHIV experiences loss of face as a result of violation to cultural norms, which greatly affects their access to social capital and closely parallels how stigma works in Chinese society. In Hong Kong, studies have documented a high level of unfavourable attitudes and stigmatizing behaviours towards PLHIV. For example, a population\u2010based study among Hong Kong adults reported that nearly half of them exhibited discriminatory attitudes towards PLHIV.23 A comparative study on the public's attitude towards different types of infectious diseases have shown that the level of public stigma towards HIV was the highest compared to other infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis (TB).24 PLHIV are also disadvantaged in terms of economic and social opportunities. For example, a local study reported that 20% of the studied companies would dismiss an employee if he or she was HIV+, and only a few companies indicated that they would provide counselling and support to an HIV+ employee.25 Comparative study on employer attitudes towards PLHIV in Beijing, Hong Kong and Chicago revealed the trend of reluctance to hire PLHIV are most pronounced among employers from Beijing and Hong Kong.26 Study among PLHIV in Hong Kong has also shown that over 50% felt that they were discriminated in different settings such as in the workplace and in social relationships.27\n",

In one study among 322 PLHIV in China, 78% of them had the feeling of negative worth and 58% of them were unwilling to disclose their HIV status.30 It is also reported that the level of internalized stigma was similar between PLHIV diagnosed less than 1 year ago and more than 1 year, indicating that level of self\u2010stigma did not reduce across time.31 Self\u2010stigma is significantly associated with various negative outcomes such as worse psychosocial well\u2010being,32 worse mental health31, 33, 34, 35 and worse physical health,36, 37 suicidal ideation,38 poorer access to health services,35, 39, 40 delay or non\u2010adherence to medication treatment,41, 42 and poor quality of life43, 44 among PLHIV.",

            "text": "Given the potential adverse consequences of HIV stigma, exploring the factors associated with stigma is important to understanding and ameliorating stigma among PLHIV. To date, most of the studies on stigma have focused on how self\u2010stigma might affect health and relatively little attention has been paid to the factors which may contribute to the perception of stigma among PLHIV. Studies of other health conditions indicated that the way people attribute their disease may influence their internalization of stigma. For example, local studies on people with schizophrenia and parents of children with autism showed that attribution of perceived controllability of the disease, personal responsibility to the cause of the illness and self\u2010blame was significantly associated with higher levels of self\u2010stigma.45, 46 However, one local study looking at factors associated with self\u2010stigmatization using the attribution model for PLHIV, including self\u2010blame, responsibility for contacting HIV and internal controllability for contracting HIV, showed that although attributions of control predicted attributions of responsibility which, in turn, predicted self\u2010blame, the linkage between self\u2010blame and self\u2010stigma was not significant.47 Other factors have also been proposed. Recent studies in adults living with HIV have found that optimism predicts lower levels of HIV\u2010related stigma indirectly through increasing psychological well\u2010being32 and also that personal meaning predicts lower level of HIV\u2010related stigma indirectly through increasing social support.48 These mechanisms have not been explored in the local context.",

Our findings suggest that many participants have shown feelings of shame and guilt as they considered themselves responsible for the infection. As most of the participants acquired HIV through heterosexual contact with sex workers or homosexual contact with men, it is conceivable that participants demonstrated an internal attribution of the disease and thus reporting negative feelings of shame and guilt and a high level of self\u2010stigmatization.

As the HIV population in Hong Kong are predominantly male who contract HIV through sexual behaviours, it may further reinforce the public idea that only those male who are homosexuals or promiscuous would get HIV, creating further stigmatization. The negative connotations carried by HIV are consistent with a local study that a sizeable proportion of the respondents hold negative perceptions about PLHIV.23 Such misrepresentation of HIV tend to be partly due to the inaccurate and biased information presented by the media in the early 1990s, which framed HIV negatively as a dead pyramid, indicating that HIV was a fatal illness with no treatment available. Despite that fact that the disease has been transformed into chronic illness in the post\u2010HAART era, the message has not been well disseminated to the public. The negative perceptions and stereotypes endorsed by the society might intensify the beliefs of PLHIV that they are inferior and should be blamed and stigmatized by the society.

Our findings suggest various ways in which HIV stigma could be reduced. First, the present findings reveal that misconceptions about HIV could intensity stigmatization; therefore, there is a need for both PLHIV and the public to be better educated about HIV and this should be given the highest priority in HIV stigma reduction. Local studies have revealed that misconceptions about HIV in Hong Kong fall particularly on its mode of transmission and mortality rate.23 Therefore, education in these two particular areas of HIV should be introduced in both clinic and community settings. Other studies also suggest that interventions designed to address negative self\u2010image or stigma of HIV could include a variety of modes such as individual or counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, social support and empowerment.57, 58 In particular, family of the PLHIV and health\u2010care professionals should also be targeted in interventions as the present study shows that discrimination and social rejections also originated from them. There has been evidence that community\u2010based HIV stigma reduction programme was effective to help family members gain a richer understanding of HIV stigma, ways to cope with it and ways to be more supportive to PLHIV.59 To reduce HIV stigma in the health\u2010care setting, interventions must focus on the individual, environmental and policy levels.60 At the individual level, it is important to increase awareness of stigma and the benefits of reducing stigma among health workers. In the environmental level, there is a need to ensure that health workers have the information, supplies and equipment necessary to practice universal precautions and prevent transmission of HIV. It is also important to enact policies that protect the safety and health of patients and health\u2010care professionals in order to prevent discrimination against PLHIV. However, this might be difficult to achieve given the lack of policies to prevent discriminations against vulnerable groups in Hong Kong.",

It might be possible that those who were affiliated with HIV\u2010related organizations had lower level of stigma, and those who had higher level of stigma were more likely to isolate themselves and less likely to be approached.
